Oh, my god! Oh, my god! No, he's wrong! Is this the world you want to live in, Sir? Jenny witnessed something shocking on the subway. Just as her friend grew curious, they saw an unsettling scene. An old man had his hand down his pants. Big what? Don't say it's big. One friend decided to use the Bible to enlighten. But while no one was paying attention, Jenny retaliated by putting her hand in her pants and gradually sped up her movement. Surprisingly, the old man across from them seemed turned on. Her friend urged Jenny to stop, but she stood up and encouraged everyone to confront the man. As Jenny's motion grew faster, her friend finally pulled her away. As they were leaving the subway, Jenny's friend quickly guided her out. He had noticed a strange wet stain on Jenny's shoe. The next day, Jenny showed up for an interview. As a victim would speaker, the interviewer asked for proof of victim status. Jenny confidently handed over her woman card. The interviewer looked confused, so she reached into her bag and pulled out a sex worker permit. Intrigued, the interviewer decided to give her a chance. I mean, I guess you could try and, like, roll the dice.

Anna, however, didn't notice anything amiss with Jack. She quickly found a book, but the passages in it, describing intimate relations between men and women were like nothing either of them had ever seen. Five years earlier, their father had died in a car accident. Their mother had taken them to live with their grandmother. But in hopes of marrying their mother off to a wealthy family, the grandmother had locked all four of her grandchildren in the attic. They'd been trapped there for five years. Jack and Anna were now entering puberty, yet they still shared the same room. Anna even admired her own figure right in front of Jack, making him burn with a feverish heat. But due to his lack of knowledge, Jack had no idea why he felt that way. Anna, oblivious to his state, danced in front of him as she always did, stoking the fire in his body until it felt like it might consume him. Anna then playfully snatched Jack's paintbrush. In his rush to get it back, he pushed her to the floor. Staring at Anna's beauty, Jack froze just as he felt an urge to do something, but didn't know what. Their grandmother walked in, furious at what she thought she caught Jack doing. She punished him.

As this invisible presence slowly parted her legs, she felt it slip under the covers with her. Summoning all her courage, she yanked off the blanket to confront whatever was there, but found nothing at all. Luna couldn't tell if she was dreaming or awake anymore. She drifted off into a deep sleep, surrendering to the mysterious force as it caressed her body. The next morning at work, her co workers couldn't stop commenting on how radiant she looked. For someone who'd been perpetually single, Luna suddenly found herself getting hit on by a customer. They exchanged numbers. Later, when Luna was on the phone with her new admirer at home, the ghost got jealous. It began tormenting her, and an invisible force pressed her down onto the couch. That evening, Luna invited her suitor over for dinner. She was in the kitchen preparing a home cooked meal when the ghost's jealousy flared up again. In just three minutes, it left her in a daze, barely conscious state. When Luna came to her senses, she wanted nothing more than to be with the ghost. She made up an excuse to send her date away. But when she went to bed that night, waiting expectantly, the ghost never showed. Disappointed and desperate, Luna searched everywhere for it. She even consulted a psychic, begging her to cast a spell to bring the ghost back. The psychic had Luna lie down in her bedroom. With a wave of her hands, the bedroom door swung open on its own and footprints appeared on the floor. The ghost had returned.

When the teacher saw his drawings during class, she was furious. She pulled out his test paper, and there it was, a big, fat zero. But the boy just smiled, completely unfazed. To punish him, the teacher kept him after school and wrote a math problem on the blackboard. Boy stared at it for a moment, deep in thought. But in his imagination, the problem turned into a wolf and a rabbit. That made the teacher even angrier. So she wrote another one, 5 + 3 equals. This time, the boy drew a giraffe. Now she was truly furious. She threw down her book and stormed into the teacher's office. As she looked over the exam results, she noticed that he was the only one in the class who had failed. A wave of guilt washed over her. Maybe it wasn't just his fault. Just then, the boy quietly walked in and handed her a drawing. She sighed, feeling helpless. But then she noticed something. The little goldfish in his picture was shaped exactly like the No. 9. A spark of realization hit her. She started flipping through his old notebooks, and only then did she understand the boy had been using animals represent numbers all along. The next day after school, she kept him again, but this time she drew a picture on the blackboard. The boy, Looked at it quietly for a few seconds, then wrote down the correct answer. From that moment on, the teacher changed the way she talked. She borrowed art books from the library, Learned to speak his language of drawings, and used it to explain math problems. Gradually, the boy began to change, too. His grades rose from 10 to 50. Seeing his progress, the teacher couldn't help but smile with pride. On graduation day, while the other students were taking pictures with their families, the boy stood alone in the corner. Without hesitation, the teacher walked up to him, and together they took a warm and unforgettable graduation photo.

In the next moment, the date simply bounced back from him. Instantly, the enemy boats were destroyed. Dayun could hardly believe it. Then he grabbed a rope in the water with both hands and dozens of small boats were effortlessly taken out by him. Thanks to Dion's help, the days in the small kingdom became increasingly peaceful. He then became completely famous. The whole kingdom worshipped Dion like a hero. His pictures hung everywhere in the streets. Even for a haircut, you needed four or five barbers. If Dahyun felt like playing a game, it became the real life version. Immediately, it got even crazier with massages. For that, an entire company had to be assigned. This annoyed the general so much that he defected to the enemy country in the middle of the night and delivered a design for a robot there. Shortly after, an iron block stood in front of Dayun and inside sat exactly the general. But Dallyum was not impressed by the action at all. Then the general pressed the switch and after countless transformations, the iron block immediately turned into a gigantic robot. Daiyun recognized the danger and tried to escape, but the robot knocked him down with a single fist. Then it grabbed Daiyun by his pants and hurled him into the air. Daiyun desperately tried to flee. Finally, the man was tied to a wooden plank and exiled to a Faraway lonely island.

I live alone in a small and cramped basement room. The rent isn't cheap at all. Then I got a message from my dad again telling me to hurry up and find a job. I just graduated from college, so I had to work outside to make a living. At the restaurant, I saw office workers eating and drinking together. I really envy that kind of life. Later, the restaurant owner gave me an extra 50 bucks to take a cab home. But taking a cab felt too luxurious for me, so I decided to save the money instead. The next morning, I took out the other half of the noodles for breakfast. Suddenly, my phone rang. It was the luckiest call I'd ever received. They told me I just been hired by a big company. My future was finally looking bright. I immediately called my mom to share the good news. Being a filial son, I decided to send her more money from now on. But when I checked my bank account, the 30 million one was gone. That's when I realized I hadn't been hired at all. It was actually a scam that stole my banking info. For someone broke like me, that was a fatal blow. I wanted to jump off a bridge and end my life, but the firefighters saved me after losing Everything. I became mentally unstable and was sent to a psychiatric hospital. Every day, the nurses came to inspect our beds and lockers because some patients would bring in dangerous things or throw garbage everywhere. When it was my turn to be checked, I stood in front of my locker and refused. The nurse thought I was hiding something dangerous. But when she opened it, it was completely empty, not even basic living supplies. Nurse Doyun had never seen a patient living this hard. To protect my dignity, she didn't ask any questions. Later, she heard about my story that I had been scammed out of all my money and even my hospital bills were covered by government aid. From then on, Dune decided to take good care of me, hoping I could recover soon and leave the hospital.

Now, I've linked my computer up to LAX, so as soon as I get the download, they'll have it as well. Captain Pike, maintain at 100 feet. I should be able to catch your Wi-Fi signal and download your software. This is Captain Pike. Do I have confirmation? Over. Were you able to download that software? No, there's too much of a speed differential between a plane and a stationary laptop. Over. Let's try again. Doing the same thing but expecting a different result is the definition of insanity. It won't work. Mr. O'Brien, I've got 240 souls on board. Please tell me there's something else you can. I just solved the speed differential problem.

He might just be the most perverted prison warden in history. In the name of saving food costs, he stitched together the mouths and backsides of hundreds of inmates, creating a human centipede long enough to wrap around the earth. He forced the guy at the front to eat non stop while everything passed down the line to the next person. Like a chocolate bar assembly line from hell. The sight was absolutely horrifying. But how did this warden lose his mind? It all started a few days earlier during a routine inspection. The inmates mocked him and even attacked one of his guards. That humiliation sent him completely over the edge. In a fit of rage, he strapped one prisoner to a table and poured concentrated sulfuric acid all over him. Then he dragged another inmate into a secret room, where he brutally castrated him. But it gets even worse. The warden actually ordered the prison chef to cook the man's organs into a fancy meal. Meanwhile, riots kept breaking out all over the prison. The mayor warned him that if he didn't get things under control soon, he'd be fired. That's when one of his guys came up with a twisted solution. Connect all the prisoners head to tail. That way, they couldn't move, couldn't fight, and couldn't attack the guards. The warden absolutely loved this idea. He immediately had every inmate sedated. Brought in a doctor to perform the surgeries, and even forced his own secretary to join the chain. A few days later, the mayor showed up to inspect the prison. He was outraged and condemned the warden for violating human rights. But after thinking about it for a moment, the mayor completely changed his tune. Instead of firing him, he actually promised the warden a promotion and a raise.

Oh, my hair! Oh, my gosh! Ah! Oh, my god! Who did this? The girl who was bullying Reese had cut off all her hair. My son told me it was because her hair was completely matted with gum.

But these were just simple acts of revenge. My real target was the main girl who always bullied Reese. I made a call to her parents pretending to confirm a hotel reservation. I told them their daughter had booked a couple suite at our hotel, and I asked when she was planning to check in. Just as I'd hoped, her father took the bait. He started screaming at his daughter, demanding to know why she was getting a hotel room. The girl had No clue what was even happening. I also prepared a special gift for her. Oh, my god.

Come on. After returning to camp, they told the others what had just happened. Everyone believed that the maze's exit must be the monster's lair. However, golly disagrees. Truth is, Thomas doesn't know what he's done, as usual. Well, at least I did something, Gally. what have you done aside from hide behind these walls all the time? You've been here three days. All right. I've been here three years. Yeah, you've been here three years and you're still here, Gally. Alright, so what does that tell you? Maybe you should start doing things a little differently. Maybe you should be in charge. Thomas Learned from one of the injured that they had all been put there on purpose. I remember. What do you remember? You're always their favorite, Thomas. Why did you do this? Soon, Knight fell dot. But this time none of the stone doors closed. It was something that hadn't happened in three years. The monsters from the maze burst in, sending everyone running in panic. Many of their companions were devoured. Thomas LED a small group into a wooden cabin, but it couldn't hold off the monster's assault. Grab him! Grab him. Just as Chuck was about to be struck by a venomous stinger, a nearby companion immediately rushed over when they thought they had finally driven the creature away. Thomas, get the lock. Rage drove Thomas to lose all reason. He charged out, determined to fight the monster. Himself dot only to find it had vanished. Golly believes that it's all Thomas's fault. It's all you, Thomas. Look around. Back up, guys. That's not Thomas's fault. And he's one of them. What a who? He's one of them. And they sent him here to destroy everything and now he has. That incident made Thomas start questioning who he really was. He grabbed the severed stinger from the monster and plunged it into his own thigh. In an instant, flashes of his past rushed through his mind. He saw himself working in a laboratory. Everyone in the camp was part of an experiment. He had been turned into a test subject himself because he tried to put an end to the experiment. When Thomas regained consciousness, he found himself locked in a dungeon. Theresa had used an antidote to save his life. Golly plans to sacrifice them to the monster tomorrow. The next day, Thomas teamed up with a group of companions and launched a rebellion just as they were about to be sacrificed. Before leaving, Thomas urged everyone to come with him and search for the way out. I rather wish my life out there than spending the rest of it in here. We don't belong here. Hey, this place is in our home. We were put here. We were trapped here. At least out there we have a choice. We can make it out of here. Many people, after hearing his words, decided to follow Thomas into The maze to search for the exit.

This time he found the door switch, but when he got to the door, it just shut off. David tried all the method. Tape didn't work. The switch couldn't be tied. The man was momentarily stunned. He pressed a random switch, but the rope popped out. David came up with an idea. He stepped on the switch with his foot. He grabbed the rope and went to the door. This time, he finally succeeded. David ran in, but there was another door, but you needed a key to open it. He had to go back to find the key. Unexpectedly, the door crushed his waist. David lost his sense of taste and feeling. He kicked towards the wall and unexpectedly the key popped out. He was about to get it, but it disappeared into thin air. He intended to press the switch again, but forgot which switch it was. He had to press a random one. Instantly, he was scared out of his pants. But to get out, he had to continue even if he was scared. David carefully tried again, finally opened the key. He grabbed the tools, used the rope to swing over, press the key button, came back to get the key, then stepped on the door switch and quickly ran to the door. A set of silky, smooth movement, the man stepped forward and opened the door. With a click. Finally, he could go out unexpectedly. He couldn't push the door. David looked and found a combination lock. The man instantly froze. While the door was open, he ran out. As a result, his back was injured again. The man was very angry. David pulled out the belt and threw it to the ground. He hit the switch right in the middle. Then a black man came through the wall. The two sides looked at each other. The black man turned his head and walked away. It suddenly thought of a way. The four numbers on the black man's head must be the combination to the lock. He went in again and entered the code. He didn't expect the code to be right. David pulled the door open. The next second, the room's door suddenly closed. At this point, he had no choice. He was stuck between the two doors. The man was very desperate, couldn't help but cry, remembering the beauty of the room except that he couldn't get out. But there was everything to eat and use, but now he was trapped in the room. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew. The man pulled open the door. The door next to him could be open. David ran outside, through door after door. He finally escaped. This is the end of the film.

I wouldn't spend another fucking day with you. I'm checking out Sarah the fuck are you talking about? I didn't think this day would ever come. What you getting an entire meal? I'm gonna be dead in less than 2 weeks. I don't want to leave a scrawny corpse. Will you cut that bullshit out? It's not bullshit, Sarah. I've never been more serious in my life. Hey, where's my food? My food, my food. You understand me, you little shit. The night comes and I'm done. Jesse, what the hell are you talking about? I love you. I always have. Hello? Hi, Mr Peterson, it's Sarah. Look, whatever Jesse's done, I don't want to hear about it. He plans on killing himself. I don't know what kind of game you're trying to play. But I. It isn't a game. He's planning on doing it tonight at midnight.

And you won't believe what he had to say. How are you? Good, man. How you doing? How did you get, how did you get on the highway? I was coming out of trail. Why? Oh, alright. Just what's, what's going, motorcycle run. Oh, that's what I knew something was going on. I'm like, there's nobody on the, on the highway. Yeah, like that was weird. Can you just start? Yeah. Yeah, Thank, thank you. Alright. Some gloves, huh? Huh? Yeah, some gloves. Haha. How far out are they? Just past the William Floyd. Oh, alright. I'm driving Uber. My passenger is getting arrested. Hey, bro, turn that off. Okay. No, I'll keep recording. Thank you. Yeah, it's my right. Don't record me. You got me. I, I will. Look, you're a police officer on duty. I can record you. Turn it off and I can do it, man. Just the butt, bro. What are you arresting me for? I'm recording it in case anything happens. Yeah. Roll K9 this way. Please. Bring the k nines. I don't care, man. Okay. I know my rights. Hey, I hope so. I know, I know what the law is. I know the law. I'm an attorney. So I would hope I know the law. And an Uber Driver, you want my bar card? Yeah, I work at the courthouse. What courtroom you work in? Um, you work in 3 17. 3, 17 in our 200. I've never seen you there. I've never heard of this law that you're not allowed to record the police anymore. It must be brand new. I just recently passed it. So well, here's your license. We're gonna wait for a K9 because I don't know if he might have dumped something under the seat and you don't want us to look. If you threw something under the seat, it still has nothing to do with me. What's his indicator? If he smells something, I don't know what he does. Some are passive, some are aggressive. Shocker. All of a sudden there's probably cause to search my car. This cop just made the biggest mistake of his life. In September 2021, cops pulled over Clifford Owensby, a paraplegic man for tinted windows and requested a K9 free air sniff. Owensby said he could not exit the vehicle due to his disability and what happened next is shocking. I can't step out the car, sir. I'm a paraplegic. I got help getting here. You have to be out of the car. I do not get out of the vehicle, sir. I cannot step out. I'm a paraplegic. I cannot. Come on. I'm a paraplegic, sir. Come on. Come on, bro. Come on. Step out of the car. I cannot step out of the car. I Cannot step out of the car. You're getting out of this car so you can cooperate and get out of the car. I will drag you out of the car. Get out of the car. What are you doing, bro? Dude, you're making this worse. I'm a paraplegic, bro. I'm trying to tell you that I got help getting in the car. Y'all can hurt me. Y'all can hurt me. Get out the car. That's cool. I'm a problem. Get out the car. Get out the car. Somebody help.

Who the fuck is this guy? Who the fuck? Police officer pulls over his own boss for speeding? What he does will shock you. Hello, guess who I just pulled over? Who? Yarbrough. Really? Yeah, the chief deputy driving a Dodge Charger. A souped up Dodge Charger belongs to the sheriff's office. I just clocked this at 96 in a 35. What was the issue? I mean, why is he speeding? No, no reason. He's an unmarked. Sorry, I just got a high horsepower car and decide he want to play. It's your traffic stop. You do what you think you should do. I mean, I'm not telling you. One way or another, you do a 96 and a 35. Okay. Well, you know, I don't care for him, so I'm a ride his. Sir, here's your ID back. This is your copy of the citation.

On the other side of the wall, her husband heard the noise, but instead of getting angry, he felt this uncontrollable thrill. Roy never thought that this quick moment of happiness would come at such a crazy price. Born into a rich family, Roy could have picked a wealthy and stable marriage thanks to her looks and status. But money and luxury meant absolutely nothing to her. She wanted a real connection. Deep in her soul, Roy loved literature and fell head over heels for the writer Jack at first sight. Pretty soon, Jack fell deeply in love with this smart and gorgeous woman. But reality completely crushed all their dreams. Roy's parents suddenly hit major money problems. Needing cash fast, they plan to sell off their daughter's dowry. Roy was forced to marry James, this older guy, not knowing that this decision would drag her into a total nightmare. James was a business partner of Roy's parents. He was obsessed with her from the moment they met. Even though Roy felt nothing. She had no choice, couldn't fight this marriage. But love can't be forced. After the wedding, there was only awkward silence. Roy grew distant and cold. Two years passed like that. Later, Roy ran into Jack again. Now a famous writer with tons of fans. But blinded by love, Roy didn't care about any of that. She threw herself into Jack's Arms without thinking twice, not knowing it was all part of James's carefully planned trap.

Can you take it off of me? This veteran was riding with his daughter on the back when they made a huge mistake by pointing at a cop car. We're getting pulled over. We're getting pulled over behind. What? I tried to tell you, man. I tried to tell you, but what happened next was unbelievable. What's going on with your tag? Hold on, I got music going. I'm just trying to give you these. I ain't going nowhere. Just put them in the ignition. You're fine. What's going on with your tag here? Oh, I was taking pictures earlier, so I folded it up. I got all my stuff for. It's insured. I got you. That's my dad. I don't know how to do this, man. I've never been pulled over with my gun on me. Can you take it off of me? Right here. Is it loaded? Yes, it is. It's in a holster. If you just take the whole holster. Perfect. I tried to tell you. I was, like, hitting. Yeah, I know. I had music going. Where'd you serve? I was in the army for four years. Y'all have a good one, okay? I appreciate you guys. You do currently have a California driver's license. You just don't have a physical copy on you at the moment. That's my preferred method of identification. And this is. It's a cat collar. I'm currently identifying as a cat. Fair enough. Uh, the information here on the tag, I'm assuming belongs to you. The boyfriend? Yeah. That's so rude. I hope you know I'm recording. Well, wasn't my intention to offend you, but he just identified as a cat and you're wearing a Harris Waltz T-shirt. So forgive me if I came to a conclusion that you guys are involved in some sort of a homosexual arrangement. I'm not mad that you think we're together, but you're using gender language. Besides, I'm not his boyfriend, I'm his owner. Okay, well, look, we can do this the hard way if you like. I can have this car towed. Cause last I checked, a cat is not licensed to operate a motor vehicle in the state of California. We can have animal control come get you, take you to a shelter where you're owner can retrieve you for a fee of $70. After you're given the necessary immunizations, which do include a rabies shot, possibly even spayed or neuter, whichever you prefer. Identify with uh. Is that what you guys want to do here? What should we do? I don't know. I don't have $70. Sir, I can also, uh, request that a mental health care professional come down here on scene and do an evaluation of you. Because you're considering letting him take a rabies shot. Rather than just give me an ID, use some manner so I can give you your ticket and move along. Take a look at This video, it shows a 12 year old out riding his bike in an upscale neighborhood here in Southern California last week. He comes up on an 80 year old woman who immediately has words for him. Get the hell off the sidewalk! She pushes him off the sidewalk and then. Please don't touch me. Why did you just hit me? Want me to hit you again? What the fuck is wrong with you? That's right. She apparently hits the kid. But it doesn't end there. When the boy's mother comes out, the old lady doubles down on her story. She just hit me. Uh huh. She just hit me. He tried to run us down on the sidewalk. I did not. And. And lie to us. I have a video. It's a great thing that there's a camera strapped to his chest. Good. Come on, boy, just get it on. Let me see it. The mom had apparently told the boy to ride on the sidewalk because he was recently almost hit by a car. The sidewalk Karen, as she's been dubbed, is 80 year old Susan Garcia. She told local media she felt helpless and scared. But after seeing the video, police charged her with assault.

I truly didn't want, like, I felt like I have 3 dogs now. I feel like he's a really loving dog. He's not an attack dog. You know, why he ran out today, I don't know. I raised him from a pup. How old's the dog? Uh, I'm not sure.

Están construyendo un muro a su manera tras la pulverización del mortero de cemento. Un simple raspado con una placa plana grande transforma la estructura de acero en un muro de cemento liso. Este equipo se llama máquina de proyección de mortero y es común verlo en las obras de construcción en comparación con el enlucido manual tradicional. Su eficiencia de proyección es varias veces mayor y, además proporciona una superficie de muro más sólida y lisa. Su principio es simple, una bomba de alta presión rocía mortero de cemento a gran velocidad con una presión máxima de hasta 15 mp, lo que permite que el mortero se adhiera firmemente a la superficie del muro y evita que se desprenda. En la construcción de embalses, piscinas o incluso laderas empinadas, los trabajadores pueden completar fácilmente la proyección de toda la superficie samplemente de pie, en el suelo o bajo el andamio, lo que resulta seguro y eficiente.

The room was packed with famous authors. The most eye catching was Nick, now 50 years old, widely known as a literary giant. At the event, Emma not only Learned a ton about literature, but was also deeply drawn to this charming man. His presence and words radiated pure masculine charm. The next day, Emma made a special trip to the bookstore to find more literary works. Since that meeting, she often got letters from Nick. The letters explained words she didn't get, but also brought a strange feeling, like some secret silently followed them. It was Emma's first brush with love. Torn between excitement and confusion, she carefully penned all these feelings in her diary. At the second book club, Emma's mom showed up again. But this time, Emma noticed her mom was getting close with another author. That scene stirred deep and new emotions inside Emma's heart.

Then they used a fan to dry the glue quickly. When the glue set, they cut a hole with a knife. After that, they added a pair of glasses. They originally thought John could only hold out for a few days at most, but they didn't expect him to be stuck in the lab. As time went by, John got more and more irritable. Finally, one day, he escaped. When John got home, he saw his neighbor changing clothes at home. However, at the crucial moment, the woman pulled up the curtain. John looked at himself in the mirror and suddenly realized he had the ability to be invisible. This meant he could do whatever he wanted. So just after the woman finished taking a shower, there was a knock on the door. The woman walked to the door but found there was nothing outside. She thought it might be her imagination, but unexpectedly, the doorbell rang again. The next second, the woman was a bit confused and then walked to the door and opened it, but the corridor was empty. However, just then, John sneaked into the woman's house without making a sound.

No magic comes from nothing. The teacher lifted a bouquet. The flowers wilted instantly. A stone rose into the air. My classmates copied her. Their stones floated in the air. I tried again and again. I failed. Every time teacher came up to me, she scolded me for rushing, for trying to use magic to make myself pretty. I was born with a curved spine. My mouth was crooked. I was ugly. In class, I was always the slowest. I broke down. I looked at myself in the mirror. I sobbed out loud. The next day, the teacher took us to the seagull tower. She told us to hold up bottles to catch lightning. Dora went first. She lifted her bottle carefully. The lightning knocked her out. Annie went next. She hesitated for a moment. She caught the lightning. The bottle shattered. When it was my turn, I gave the teacher a cold glance. I gathered my courage. I raised the bottle high. Lightning struck my chest. It slammed me into the wall. I watched the other succeed. I kept failing. I saw the disappointment in the teacher's eyes. I felt utterly insignificant. Humiliation, resentment, they flooded me. Anger lit up inside me. The teacher saw my potential. She told me inner beauty is the true beauty. She told me not to let anger consume me. That night, the teacher took the girls who failed the exam away. I followed secretly. I watched her turn. The three students into eels. She already knew I was behind her, she told me. She only took away their control. They would provide energy for the academy like flowers. Their best purpose was to wither. Right after the teacher prepared to give me a flawless face, I stared at my ugly reflection. She told me to close my eyes to imagine the most beautiful woman in the world. And then.

What are you talking about? I have appendicitis, mom. I had Katie drive me here this afternoon. I was in so much pain, I could barely move. I called you and dad. Neither of you picked up. Elizabeth, I'll come to see you once your father gets home. Benny can't stay home alone, and the hospital scare him. Your father should get back in about two hours. Can you hang on until then? Don't let them do any procedures on you until I get there. Mom, are you serious right now? Excuse me? Ben is 12, mom. 12 years old. He can stay home alone. He's not a little baby anymore. He can entertain himself. He doesn't need to be connected to you at the hip all the time. Or tell him to grow the hell up and just come to the hospital. If it was Ben in the hospital, not me, you'd be here in a heartbeat. You'd drop everything, leave work, leave anything. Elizabeth, how dare you talk to me that way? How dare you be so selfish? Have some respect, mom. You don't understand. You don't respect me. You don't care about anything that I love. You only care about Ben. Do you even love me, mom? Oh, Elizabeth, you haven't noticed a single thing about my life in years. You haven't even bothered to care. Mom, you haven't noticed that I have a girlfriend? Mom, we've been dating for a year. Now, we went to prom together, but you make me leave early to pick up Ben from a sleepover because he forgot his iPad at home. My girlfriend and I got into the interview recently. It's on the school website. But you never even watched it. Elizabeth, please let me talk. I'm packing a bag right now. I'm going to bring Ben to his friend's house and head to you. No. All you do is talk, and all I do is listen. I'm done. Mom, I want you to hear me. Please, Mommy, hear me. I'm listening, Beth. I'm listening. I hate myself. I feel like I'll always be nothing. You've made me feel like I'll forever be nothing. Like I'll never matter. And honestly, maybe I won't ever matter. I've spent so much time adjusting to what you need me to be, what you expected of me. I stopped even caring if I liked myself. And I don't. I hate myself. And I hate that all I do is please other people. Beth, I'm on the way right now. Please just wait until I get there. We can talk, okay? Actually, no, I will listen. I will. I promise. And you talk. I'm sorry. I know I should have said it sooner. Yeah, you're right. You should have. And it's too late for sorry. At least this way, you can finally put that college fund of mine towards Ben's dreams like you've always wanted to. Elizabeth, what are you Talking about. What are you doing? Elizabeth? Elizabeth? Elizabeth, please answer me. Beth, please pick up the phone. I'm five minutes away. Mommy. So sorry.

I guess your little girlfriend made sure of that, huh? Of course she'd go into labor today on my birthday. What a coincidence. Are you serious right now? You think Anna planned this?

You changed the day you met her. You stopped coming over. You didn't show up for the family cookout. You said you were tired. But I know it was her. And now I spent weeks planning this birthday dinner. Everyone's here. Your uncle, your aunt, even grandma. And my son's seat is empty. Did you even freaking hear what I said? The doctor said Anna's fate is uncertain, and you're talking about a dinner? You were my baby first. All I wanted today was a hug from my son. One picture, one memory. You think your little family matters more than the one that raised you? That is the most selfish thing I've ever heard. You're evil. You want me to leave the woman I love? Well, she's fighting for everything. Just so you don't feel left out. Cantina. Ask. Bring Robert. Help me cook. My son for choosing his girlfriend over his own mother. Tell him.

I want the boy who made me laugh, the boy who asked me to braid his hair, who watched Disney movies with me on the couch. Now all I see is this bitter, distant man, and it's all because of her. Wow. You know what? I hope one day you realize how insane you sound. And until that day comes, I never want to talk to someone as selfish as you again. You don't mean that. Please tell me you don't mean that. Chris. Chrissy, baby, don't do this to your mama. Chrissy. You selfish, freaking brat! Do you even realize what you just did to your mother? Dad, not you, too.

I'm sorry, but I had to stand up for Anna. No, she's not fine. She. He's in the ER. What? What are you talking about? After you told her you never wanted to see her again. It hurt bad. I had to take her there. Oh, my god, dad, I didn't mean for that to happen. Don't give me that crap. You know your mother has. You knew what you were doing when you did that, and for what? Some freaking cake? Anna is in labor! They Don't know what will happen. I had no choice. There's always a choice. And you made yours. Don't call me dad anymore. It's Peter to you now. Dad, no.

Your mom called me asking if I knew where you were. I told her you were in my house, in the bathroom, just to cover for you. But seriously, where are you? It's been a day now. Elio. Your mom's freaking out, and honestly, so am I. She called the police. I haven't told them that I lied for you. I keep telling her you're here, but I have no idea where you are. Please come home. I'm getting really worried. I asked my favorite astrology app, Astro App, for advice and it said that I'm a cancer, so I can get really emotional when I feel abandoned. It told me to take deep breaths and focus on grounding myself so I can stay calm and clear minded while waiting to hear from you. Elio, it's been a week. Everyone saying you're missing. Like actually missing. Your mom's been crying non stop and they filed a police report. Where are you? What's going on, Ello? It's been a month now. They still can't find you. I don't even know what to tell people anymore. I got a cat to help with the loneliness, I guess. I named him Charlie. Figured you'd like that. Wish you could see him. She's really sweet. Sleeps with me every night. She and was born on Valentine's Day too. Hahaha. It's been two months since you disappeared. I stopped writing to you because it felt like screaming into the void. Your mom's pregnant. Can You believe that? Guess there'll be another Elio around soon. I miss you so much, Elio. 10 months now. Your sister's almost here. Her name is going to be Julia. I keep hoping you'll walk through the door before she's born. Ello, it's been two years. I know that sounds insane, but part of me still thinks you're coming back. I can't move on from this. Everyone tells me to, but I can't. It's like a piece of me went missing with you. Hey. I need to tell you this. I'm getting married. I found someone who loves me. I think you'd like him. He's the love of my life. And I'm finally getting married. I asked for star rings so you'd be here with me in some way. I miss you more than ever right now. Ilio. It's been five years. I don't know what to say anymore. But I'm still here. They closed your case, the police. No one's looking for you anymore. But I'll never stop. I'm thinking of searching for you on my own, but in secret. Oh, and I'm pregnant. It's a boy. I'm naming him Ilio, after you. Hey. Wow. I didn't even realize we're still having this conversation. It's been seven years. My son's been born. Look. I think he looks a bit like you. He's as cute as you were. Or maybe that's just me imagining things. Wish you could see him. Hey, Elio. It's been 11 years. He's turning four today. Time flies, doesn't it? Feels like yesterday when I last saw you. He really admires you, you know. I always tell him how great you were as a boyfriend. He says you're still alive, that we're so connected. That's why I feel like you're still around. But I don't know. Sometimes I lose faith in you coming back. I wonder if he's right. I still feel you somehow, Ello. It's been 14 years. My new boyfriend tells me I need to move on. Says I'm holding on too tight. But my son, he still believes you're coming back. He's only a kid, but he has more faith than I do by now. It's been 20 years, Elio. Wow. My boy's nine now. He's getting so big. And guess what? I'm pregnant again. With a girl. She's due in four months, and I'm naming her Jula. Like your sister. Speaking of, your sister moved back in with your parents. She's not doing well. She barely speaks to anyone. It's like everything fell apart when you left. Elio, it's been 25 years. I built the house we dreamed of. Remember that? I also got divorced, though. He cheated on me. Now it's just me, Elio, Julia, and the cat. Still waiting for you, I guess. I miss you more than I can put into words, Elio. You have no idea. Every single day. Bria. The fuck you mean I died? I was just having some burger and fries. You're already planning my Funeral chill. You can now check part two by pressing share. Then more.

Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. I'm taking him to his practice. When you get home, hand me your phone. I'll be holding on to it for a few days until you can learn how to speak to me, okay? Elizabeth, Ben needs to borrow your iPad for an hour. His died, and I promised him an hour of screen time. Mom, I'm taking notes on it right now. Can I give it to him once I'm done? You still have that notebook Grammy gave You. For your birthday last year, right? Yes, why? Well, that means you can take paper notes then. It's one hour. Don't be selfish. Mom, Prom is this weekend. Could we maybe go dress shopping this Friday? I've got to take Ben to all of his games this week. Ask your father. Okay. Did you push your brother? He took my phone, wouldn't give it back, and when I tried to take it, he bit me. So, yes, I pushed him and he dropped it. Not hard, just hard enough to lose grip on the phone. Apologize to your brother. I got called into work early today. Can you pick up Ben's cake? His party is at 5:30. That cake can't be late. Okay, mom. Also, I paid for it 50% up front. I'm going to need you to pay for the other 50% when you get there. How much was his cake? $400. Please pay the $200. Mom, I don't have that money right now. Elizabeth, this is Ben's 12th birthday. This is important to him. Maybe you've been spoiled with too many indulged birthdays of your own. Buy the cake. I'll see about paying you back this week. Mom, I don't mean to push, but it has been two weeks since I bought Ben's cake. I'm in charge of bringing in a food from a country. I'm studying for my history class this week. Could you please pay me back? Elizabeth, I cannot right now. Ben needed new Cleats and shin guards for practice. Mom, this class is really important to me. Please. And soccer is really important to your brother. His coaches say he has real promise. And history is important to me. Mom, I think I might really wanna pursue this. I don't have time for this right now, Elizabeth. Mom, can I talk to you about something? I'm busy right now. Elizabeth, call your father. He's at home right now. That's okay. Mom, I wanted to tell you that I got an art history internship. It's a virtual paid internship. I'll be working three days a week for three hours each day. The high school knows of the internship, and I'm doing it in place of one of my electives, so my schedule will be fine. I'm really excited for this, mom. I've been wanting to do this for so long. Will you still be able to take Ben to his weekend practices? Elizabeth, I looked into your room today, and it's filthy. Your clothes are all over the floor. It's absolutely disgusting. Clean it as soon as you come home. We're going to have ants if you keep this up. Sorry, mom. Just clean it. Why are you not up? You have class in 20 minutes. Mom, my stomach is killing me. I think I might have the flu. Are you sure that this doesn't have anything to do with your science test today? I know it's not your strongest subject, but you still Have to put in the effort. I'll make up that test. Mom, I was throwing up all night. I just need the day to rest. Fine. But you're taking your brother to practice this evening. What the hell? Elizabeth? Today was your brother's tryouts, and he missed them because of you. He texted me completely upset by the situation. I specifically told you that you had to take him this evening. Elizabeth, answer me right now. Do not ignore me! Elizabeth, I know you're reading this. I just got home from work. You're not here. Where are you? Elizabeth? Elizabeth, where are you? Answer me! You can now check part two by pressing share. Then more.

My brother's wife, Diana, discovered her ultimate weapon the day she lost her first pregnancy. If someone questioned her spending, she'd clutch her stomach and call them insensitive. If anyone in the family shared good news, she'd leave the room wailing that their happiness was triggering her grief. If my brother asked her to help with anything, she'd collapse on the couch claiming the stress could cause another loss. The manipulation quickly went from tears to total destruction. First, Diana got my mom's 60th birthday party canceled by claiming the pink decorations triggered her loss. Mom spent her milestone birthday comforting Diana instead. When my cousin announced her pregnancy, Diana screamed that we were rubbing fertility in her face and claimed the shock caused her to have a panic attack. My cousin hid her entire pregnancy in shame. Then Diana wanted a 70 thousand dollar Mercedes, but my brother said no. So she staged a total breakdown at the dealership, wailing about needing a safe car for her rainbow baby and threatened to divorce if my brother didn't buy it. She didn't spare me either and went all out during my wedding planning. Diana called all my vendors claiming my flower choices would trigger miscarriages, posted on wedding forms that I was a baby killer, and demanded I change my date because it was near her loss anniversary. When I refused. She told family members that my selfishness had caused her to lose twins, and I know it might be hard to believe, but she went even further. I was four months pregnant and had managed to hide it from everyone except Diana, who'd noticed my subtle changes. One morning, she ambushed me at a doctor's appointment with an offer that made my blood freeze. I know you're pregnant, she said calmly. Here's what's going to happen. You're going to tell everyone you're carrying a baby for me as a surrogate. You'll give birth, hand the baby to me, and I'll finally be the mother. Everyone pities me for not being. I laughed, thinking she was joking, but she wasn't. If you refuse, I'll tell everyone you've been mocking my miscarriages throughout your pregnancy. She showed me her phone with drafted emails to my employer about my workplace harassment regarding her infertility, and even had screenshots of edited text where I called her an infertile bitch. She'd been planning this for weeks. I smiled sweetly when she saw how horrified I was and added, besides, you can always have another one. Standing there with my hand protectively over my bump, realizing Diana literally wanted to steal my child, I felt rage unlike anything before. I knew Diana's weakness was her need to maintain her victim story at all costs. She'd already sent me those fake texts and threatened emails, not knowing she was handing me evidence. So I did Something simple. I scheduled a meeting with my brother at his office, saying I needed to discuss the surrogacy arrangement Diana had proposed. When he arrived, confused, I broke down crying and showed him Diana's threatening text about taking my baby. I'm scared she'll hurt herself or the baby if I don't give in. She keeps saying this is her only chance at motherhood. My brother's face went white. He checked the time stamps on her threats and said, wait, these are from yesterday morning when she was with me at the mall. The realisation broke him. His wife had been plotting to steal his sister's baby while shopping right beside him. My brother spent three days processing everything before deciding to confront her on Mother's Day, Diana's favourite stage for sympathy. Whole family would be there, including my cousin, who'd hidden her pregnancy, and my mom, who'd lost her 60th birthday Celebration. I arrived late, seven months pregnant now and unable to hide anymore. Diana's eyes locked on my belly and she began explaining how my visible pregnancy was triggering severe cramping. Classic Diana, already spinning my presence into her trauma. That's when my brother pulled out his phone. I have something to say. Diana tried to force my

I'd like to use you as a bridge and step on your face. What happened to you? You never text anymore. You never talk anymore. Ever since you went to dumb college.

It's so stupid. It's like you packed up your bags, clothes and double chin and moved out. You're already ugly at home. Why make everyone else hate you somewhere else too? Oh, and you, Take it so seriously. We're siblings. We are not supposed to be nice. That's not really true, Mark. I don't care. I hate you. I never won't hate you. I hate me, too. Oh, it's my fault, right? My fault that you're gone. I'm in high school now. I understand now that you were insecure and I truly was a jerk. Brody died today. I read our texts and cried.

Where did you hear that date? It was in the note with Dad's watch. The watch you said was destroyed. Emma, where are you right now? Still at Jessica's. Her mom's about to drive me home. Number? Go to Aunt Claire's instead. Don't come home. You're scaring me. What's going on with these texts from Dad's number? Someone is trying to manipulate you. Your father died in that accident last month. Then why is his watch here? Why does someone know about July 15th? Your father's former partner must have gotten access to his personal effects. What partner? You said dad worked alone. I needed to protect you from certain aspects of his work. There's another text. Ask about the offshore account in the Caymans. Don't respond to any more messages. They're trying to get information. Information about what? What was dad involved in? Your father was an accountant for some powerful people. He found discrepancies. Criminal discrepancies. Was dad in danger? We're in the car now. Jessica's mom is acting strange. She keeps checking her mirrors. Is she taking you to our house or to Claire's? Neither. We're heading toward the lakehouse where the text said to go. Emma, that's not Jessica's mother. The real Carol has a scar on her wrist. She's wearing long sleeves. I can't tell. Ask to use her phone. Say yours is dying. She refused. Said her battery is low, too. Try to get a look at her wrist. Find An excuse. I asked her to check the time. No scar. Mom, who is this woman? Listen carefully. When she slows down at the next intersection, unlock your door and run. She just locked all the doors from her control panel. Is there anything in the car you can use as a weapon? Jessica's field hockey stick is in the backseat. I'm 10 minutes from the lakehouse. Is she still heading there? Yes. She just got a call. She's speaking another language. Sounds Eastern European. Your father's files exposed an international money laundering operation. Dad was just an accountant. How did he get involved in this? He was recruited specifically because of his skills. He didn't know what they were hiding. She's pulling over at the convenience store. Says she needs cigarettes. This is your chance. Get out while she's inside. I can't. She took the keys and told me she'll be watching through the window. Check the glove compartment. Is there anything useful? There's a gun, mom. A real gun. Don't touch it. It could be a setup. She's coming back. She's talking to someone outside the car. Take a photo of them. Discreetly, if you can. Done. Sending it now. That's Andre Kozlov. He worked with your father's firm. We're driving again. They're taking me to the lakehouse. The watch, Emma, is there anything unusual about it? The back has a small SD card taped to it. I never noticed before. That's what they want. Your father must Have copied the evidence. Should I destroy it? No. It's the only leverage we have. It's evidence of their entire operation. We're at the lakehouse. There's a black SUV waiting. I'm two minutes away. Can you see who's in the SUV? It's Mister Peterson from Dad's office. The one who spoke at his funeral. He's the one who recruited your father. He's been leading this whole operation. She's making me get out of the car, stall, ask questions, keep them talking until I get there. Peterson says he just wants the watch and we'll be safe. He's lying. They can't leave witnesses. He's showing me a badge. FBI. Is that possible? Huh? Boost for part three.

I was 12 when a man in a blue pickup truck pulled up next to me while I was walking home from school. He asked if I wanted to earn $20 helping him move boxes. My parents had always warned me about strangers, but $20 seems like a fortune to a kid who got $5 allowance. The the moment I got in his truck, I knew I'd made a terrible mistake. He immediately locked the doors and started driving in the opposite direction of where he said we were going. When I asked where we were headed, he told me to shut up and sit still. He drove for what felt like hours to a small cabin in the woods. No neighbours, no cell towers, nothing but trees. He dragged me inside and tied me to a chair in what looked like a basement. The smell was awful, like something had died down there. For the first two days, he barely spoke to me except to bring stale bread and warm water. I cried constantly, begging him to let me go home. He just stared at me with these cold, empty eyes and said my parents probably hadn't even noticed I was gone yet. On the third day, he made a mistake. He left his phone on the table while he went upstairs to make himself lunch. I could hear him moving around in the kitchen above me. Rope around my wrists, Had loosened slightly from struggling, and I managed to work one hand free. I grabbed his phone and called the first number I could think of, my mom's work number that she'd made me memorize for emergencies. When she answered, I whispered as quietly as I could, mom, I've been kidnapped in a cabin somewhere. There are tall pine trees everywhere, and I can hear a train in the distance. Before I could say more, I heard his footsteps coming down the stairs. I quickly put the phone back and got my hand back in the rope just as he appeared. He looked at me suspiciously, but didn't seem to notice anything different. What I didn't know was that my mom had immediately called the police while staying on the line. They traced the call and started searching for cabins near train tracks in our area. Meanwhile, she kept calling his phone every few minutes, hoping I'd answer the next morning. He seemed agitated, kept looking out the windows and pacing around the cabin. I realised later that police helicopters had been circling the area, getting closer to finding us. He started talking about moving me somewhere else, which terrified me. That afternoon, he went outside to load something into his truck. I heard him talking to someone on the phone, getting angry. While he was distracted, I noticed he'd left the basement door unlocked. This was my chance. I quietly climbed the stairs and saw him through the window. Still arguing on the phone by his truck. The front door was about 15 feet away. I knew I had to be smart about this. If I ran straight out, he'd see me immediately. Instead, I crawled on my hands and knees toward the back of the cabin. There was a small window near the floor that looks like it might be big enough for me to squeeze through. I managed to push it open and wiggle through, scraping my arms and legs on the frame. Once outside, I ran as fast as I could toward the sound of the train tracks. I figured if I could reach them, I might find help, or at least know which direction LED back to civilization. My legs felt like jelly from being tied up for days, but pure adrenaline kept me moving. After running for about 10 minutes, I heard dogs barking in the distance. Then I heard voices calling my name. It was the search and rescue team my mom had called in. I screamed as loud as I could and kept running toward the voices. A police officer

He's a bit shy to ask you for it. Could you just throw it back? Yeah, no problem. Just tell him to be careful next time. My cat does, in fact, bite. Are you serious? I hate those little monsters. They should be in the jungle, not in people's houses. Okay, relax, Lucy. You know I like you, but don't be talking like that. I'm kidding. Anyway, Coco is a sweetheart. She couldn't hurt a soul. I believe you. Can you just throw the ball back? Yeah, I'll throw it back right now. Hey, Cameron. Sorry. I know it's the second day in a row, but my son's ball has found its way to your backyard once again. He tried to get it back himself, but your cat kept hissing at him and he got scared. Could you give it back, please? Ha ha. No worries. Just tell him to never do it again or there will be problems. Excuse me? Just kidding. Relax, Lucy. Take a joke. I just got home and my back gate is open. My cat must have ran through it because I can't find him anywhere. Lucy, do you have any idea how this might have happened or where my cat might be? Oh, no, that's horrible. I have no idea who opened your gate or let your cat out. I'm sorry. Are you positive? Cameron, a missing cat is a big deal. I Wouldn't lie to you. Ask your mischievous little rat of a son if he has any idea. I'm sorry, what did you just call my son? I'm sorry. I'm just worried and stressed right now. My little Coco is missing. Me and my little rat of a son had nothing to do with it. So it's just a coincidence that Susan from across the road saw your son running out from my backyard with his ball earlier? Or are you calling her a liar? Listen, Cameron, I hope you find your little monster that you call a cat. I have things to do and places to be, so I'm going to end this conversation here. Cameron, I know we aren't on the best of terms right now, but there's an emergency. Yeah, Lucy, I would say not on the best of terms is putting it lightly, since it's been one week and Coco is still missing. There's a more important problem. My son miles was playing with his ball outside and didn't come home this evening. I'm so worried. Oh, no, that's horrible. I don't know anything about it, unfortunately. And I don't see why that's a more important problem. Susan from across the road is saying the last time she saw him was this morning going into your backyard to get his ball, and she never saw him come out. Are you calling her a liar?

That's impossible. Your father's phone was destroyed in the accident. It says, come to the lake. I'm waiting. When did you get this? Just now. Three minutes ago. Block that number immediately. Why? What if it's really him? Your father is dead, Emma. We buried him last month. But what if it wasn't him in the casket? What if. Stop! The police confirmed it was him. There's another text. I know you're reading these messages. Someone is playing a cruel joke. It says, ask your mother about the cabin key. What? What cabin key? Mom, how would they know about that? Know about what? Mom, you're scaring me. Where are you right now? At Jessica's house. Why? Stay there. Don't go anywhere. I'm coming to get you. The text says she's lying to you. She's always been lying. Turn off your phone now. Mom, there's someone outside Jessica's window. Lock the doors. Call 9 1 1. They're wearing Dad's jacket. That's not possible. His jacket was in the car with him. Unless it wasn't him in the car. Emma, listen to me. Whatever you do, don't open the door. They're holding something up to the window. What is it? It's. It's Dad's watch. The one you said burned in the fire. That's not possible. Mom, what's going on? Why did you lie about the watch? I didn't lie. I thought it was destroyed. Jessica's mom just got home. She's going to The door. Tell her not to open it. She already did. There's no one there. Check the window again. They're gone. But they left the watch on the porch. Don't touch it. Too late. There's a note inside. What does it say? Ask her about July 15th. Boost for part two.

How's it going? Um, hi. Who's this? I can't tell you that, but I go to your school. We've never talked, but I've had a crush on you since middle school. If you had a crush on me for so long, why have we never spoken? Because I'm scared. And I don't know if you would feel the same way. Why don't we play a game? Okay. What kind of game? You have until July to figure out who I am. Is this an excuse to get me to talk to you for the whole year? Pretty much. Why not? I do need to let you know I already have a crush on a girl in my school, so don't get your hopes up. That's fine. Let's see what happens. Hey. You looked hot today. You were watching me? It's kind of weird. Rizz app respond with how could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? How could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? Wow. That actually made me feel good. At least give me clues about yourself. Why? So I can at least get a starting point on who you are. Fine. I am blonde. That doesn't help me. There are lots of blonde girls in our school. Be more specific. I have a birthmark on my neck, so I have to go check every blonde girl's neck. Ha ha. So tell me about this girl you Like her name is Violet. She's perfect. We have never spoken. Sadly. Do you know her? Violet? Oops, sorry. I do know her. Maybe when I find out who you are, you can introduce me to her. You can ask her right now and she will say yes. How can you be so sure? I'm too scared to ask her. Don't worry. She is nice. Okay. Good night, mystery girl. I'm going to get some sleep. Good night. What? I don't get a message today. Ah. Does someone miss me? In your dreams. I was just surprised how my crush since middle school hadn't messaged me today. I have a question for you. Or ask away. How could you have loved me for so long if we haven't spoken ever? You are handsome. The way you talk to people. You are such a kind soul. Polite. You make everyone laugh. You are a gentleman. I always knew you are what I always wanted. Now I really wanna know who you are. Patience. Hey. Hey. Can I admit something to you? Sure. I'm not interested in Violet anymore. Really? How come? She's beautiful. So beautiful that I was too scared to even go near her. That's the issue. She's perfect in every way. But I have fallen for someone else. Someone who I do speak to. Someone who understands me. Someone without a name or a face, but someone who loves me. The day you find out who I am, I Hope we will be together. Me too. Mystery girl. Can I confess something to you? Sure. What's up? I think it's time to tell you who I am. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

I'd like to use you as a bridge and step on your face. What happened to you? You never text anymore. You never talk anymore. Ever since you went to dumb college.

I'm literally 13, bro. I hate you. I love you too. Happy birthday. I don't care. You don't even come over on holidays anymore. Why would I respond to you? Okay, why are you so different? It's so stupid. It's like you packed up your bags, clothes and double chin and moved out. You're already ugly at home. Why make everyone else hate you somewhere else too? Oh, and you, Take it so seriously. We're siblings. We are not supposed to be nice. That's not really true, Mark. I don't care. I hate you. I never won't hate you. I hate me, too.

So if I were you, bro, I would be careful. He raised an eyebrow and explained that he was only there to get free food and to try to make me jealous enough to give her another chance. It was the stupidest thing I had heard. I looked over at my ex's face was super red with embarrassment and realized that it was actually true. I felt a serious rush of ego boost, but at the same time, I felt something unexpected too. Like, dude, call me stupid. But I felt pretty touched that she would go this far just to try to win me back. It definitely wasn't the best way to win me back, but definitely creative. So I told her jokingly that if she really wanted me back, she should try showing up here alone for another month to prove that she really meant it. I walked off to finish the rest of my shift. After that, she really did show up every day with a book or journal sitting at the same booth waiting for my shift to finish. I didn't even really talk to her much and she still came around. Weeks went by and on the last day of the month, she walked into Waffle House with a huge smile on her face. I walked over with her usual order and sat beside her in the booth. She asked me, If I would finally be her boyfriend again. I smiled back and said, absolutely not. I reminded her that she cheated on me with several guys and one of them was my best friend. She picked up the glass of water and thought about splashing it all over me. Instead, she splashed water on her own face to wake herself up and left, angrily ripping up one of the menus in the restaurant out of frustration before walking out the front door. The entire angry scene was crazy cute, like, ah, there goes my little Harley Quinn. I grinned and told my manager that I was finally quitting. I chased after her and apologized, saying that I wanted to get back at her a little for the horrible mess she put me through before I unzipped my jacket and wrapped it around her head to help her stay warm. After seeing water still drip down from her hair, I took her home that night and we talked about setting new boundaries if we wanted the relationship to work better this time. To this day, we're still together and no longer the toxic kids we used to be. Also for our prenup, we had a fun photo shoot at that same Waffle House, forever reminding us of our ridiculous and petty days.

I work at a Waffle House as one of the cooks and my ex girlfriend likes to come around and set up each of her dates there only when she knows I'm working. It had been four months since our breakup, so I didn't really understand why she would waste effort coming around and showing off that she could easily land a guy. It really bothered me at first watching her laugh and enjoy each date just like how we used to. I even thought about burning their food or putting something weird in. I settled for making their food extra salty for fun. After seeing the 3rd and 4th guy, I got used to it and just treated them like another customer with no connection to me. Eventually, my ex girlfriend settled with a guy I like to call Beanie based on the black and green beanie had he liked to wear on every date. They visit Waffle House about twice a week after class. I wasn't really suspicious about their relationship or anything until I was given a different shift. They ended up changing their meal time to match my schedule. That's when I started to really think about why they kept coming around and why they needed to go out on a date while I was there at work. Like, was I really that great of a chef here? So during my break one time, I decided to Walk over and ask them why they kept coming around to have a date specifically. While I was on the clock, my ex girlfriend sipped on her Sprite and asked, what do you mean? Are you saying we're doing this on purpose? I nodded and said, yeah, that's exactly what I was implying. She sighed and leaned back in her seat, crossing her arms before looking up at me and asking, are you just jealous? I sighed, feeling like I wasted my time and said, why would I be jealous when I'm the one who broke up with you in the first place? Her mouth flung open to argue back, but I tired my attention to Beanie and said.

So I told her jokingly that if she really wanted me back, she should try showing up here alone for another month to prove that she really meant it. I walked off to finish the rest of my shift. After that, she really did show up every day with a book or journal sitting at the same booth waiting for my shift to finish. I didn't even really talk to her much and she still came around. Weeks went by and on the last day of the month, she walked into Waffle House with a huge smile on her face. I walked over with her usual order and sat beside her in the booth. She asked me, If I would finally be her boyfriend again. I smiled back and said, absolutely not. I reminded her that she cheated on me with several guys and one of them was my best friend. She picked up the glass of water and thought about splashing it all over me. Instead, she splashed water on her own face to wake herself up and left, angrily ripping up one of the menus in the restaurant out of frustration before walking out the front door. The entire angry scene was crazy cute, like, ah, there goes my little Harley Quinn. I grinned and told my manager that I was finally quitting. I chased after her and apologized, saying that I wanted to get back at her a little for the horrible mess she put me through before I unzipped my jacket and wrapped it around her head to help her stay warm. After seeing water still drip down from her hair, I took her home that night and we talked about setting new boundaries if we wanted the relationship to work better this time. To this day, we're still together and no longer the toxic kids we used to be. Also for our prenup, we had a fun photo shoot at that same Waffle House, forever reminding us of our ridiculous and petty days.

It had been four months since our breakup, so I didn't really understand why she would waste effort coming around and showing off that she could easily land a guy. It really bothered me at first watching her laugh and enjoy each date just like how we used to. I even thought about burning their food or putting something weird in. I settled for making their food extra salty for fun. After seeing the 3rd and 4th guy, I got used to it and just treated them like another customer with no connection to me.

I wasn't really suspicious about their relationship or anything until I was given a different shift. They ended up changing their meal time to match my schedule. That's when I started to really think about why they kept coming around and why they needed to go out on a date while I was there at work. Like, was I really that great of a chef here? So during my break one time, I decided to Walk over and ask them why they kept coming around to have a date specifically. While I was on the clock, my ex girlfriend sipped on her Sprite and asked, what do you mean? Are you saying we're doing this on purpose? I nodded and said, yeah, that's exactly what I was implying. She sighed and leaned back in her seat, crossing her arms before looking up at me and asking, are you just jealous? I sighed, feeling like I wasted my time and said, why would I be jealous when I'm the one who broke up with you in the first place? Her mouth flung open to argue back, but I tired my attention to Beanie and said.

An exhausted woman stood there clutching her purse, thanking mom over and over for babysitting. Behind her, a girl about 11 with dark hair hung back, clearly uneasy. Take all the time you need, mom purred in a voice I'd never heard before. The second their car turned the corner, something in Mom's face shifted into pure predator. She grabbed the girl's wrist hard enough to leave marks and dragged her toward Daniela's room. Welcome home, baby. The girl's confusion turned to fear. My name is not Daniela. It's Katie, she, I whispered. The sound of Mom's palm hitting her face made me flinch. You are Daniela, Mom shrieked. Everything accelerated into a nightmare. Mom commanded Katie to undress, but when she shook her head, mom grabbed the Scissors from Daniela's desk. Katie tried to bolt, but mom caught her by the hair. I watched frozen in horror as she cut through Katie's clothes with violent precision, humming Daniela's lullaby. Katie stood there exposed and sobbing while mom forced Daniela's tiny dress over her head. Bathroom became a torture chamber. Mom dragged the screaming girl in while I watched in horror. Through the mirror, I watched mom slather bleach on her hair. I want my mommy, she wailed. I am your mommy. Mom, god gave you back to me. In one desperate moment, when mom turned for more dye, Katie scooped bleach and smeared it across Mom's eyes. Mom's Scream was inhuman as she clawed at her face. Katie sprinted out and yelled for help. I flew downstairs and dove into the pantry with my phone. I whispered frantically to 9, 1, 1 while Katie sobs mixed with Mom's rage above us. Those minutes waiting for sirens felt like hours. When they finally broke down Daniela's door, they found mom sitting calmly on the bed, brushing both Katie's hair and the dolls. My two danielas have finally met, she announced it's proudly. Katie threw herself at the officers while mom fought like a wild animal, screaming, don't take my babies again, even as they wrestled her into handcuffs. The little girl's mom placed a restraining order on our family and Mom's been institutionalized 8 months now. Last time I visited, she grabbed my hand and whispered, I forgive you for sending Daniela away again. She smiled and for a moment I thought I saw a glimpse of mom I had before the crash until she mentioned another patient had Daniela's exact laugh. After that, dad and I cleaned out Daniela's room together and donated everything, including that horrible doll.

Are you sure you can handle this? I looked at Sarah sitting on my couch, still clutching that old backpack with everything she owned, and knew I couldn't abandon her. The custody process took six. Once Sarah's mother contested it, not because she wanted her daughter back, but because losing custody meant losing her income source.

She he'd Learned to forge her mother's signature, manage her own medical care, and even had a secret job cleaning offices at night just to afford insulin. The judge was horrified. Sarah's mother got five years for child endangerment. I got temporary custody, then permanent guardianship when Sarah turned 16. My ex had started telling people I was probably a predator for taking in a teenage girl. School was another battle. Sarah tested three grade levels behind in everything except math and science. The guidance counselor wanted to put her in remedial classes, but I saw how brilliant she was. I hired tutors with money I didn't Have and sat with her every night until 2:00am studying. The breakthrough came junior year when Sarah aced the state chemistry exam. Suddenly, colleges were calling. Harvard, Stanford, Johns Hopkins. They all wanted her. But Sarah almost didn't apply anywhere. She was convinced she didn't deserve it, that someone like her couldn't become a doctor. I had to literally drive her to the guidance office and watch her submit applications. Medical school was worse. Sarah called me at least twice a week, having panic attacks, convinced she didn't belong. Other students came from doctor families with connections. Sarah came from nothing. That was eight years ago. Sarah graduated valedictorian, got a full scholarship to medical school and just finished her residency. She's now an endocrinologist helping other diabetic kid.

I work at a Waffle House as one of the cooks and my ex girlfriend likes to come around and set up each of her dates there only when she knows I'm working. It had been four months since our breakup, so I didn't really understand why she would waste effort coming around and showing off that she could easily land a guy. It really bothered me at first watching her laugh and enjoy each date just like how we used to. I even thought about burning their food or putting something weird in. I settled for making their food extra salty for fun. After seeing the 3rd and 4th guy, I got used to it and just treated them like another customer with no connection to me. Eventually, my ex girlfriend settled with a guy I like to call Beanie based on the black and green beanie had he liked to wear on every date. They visit Waffle House about twice a week after class. I wasn't really suspicious about their relationship or anything until I was given a different shift. They ended up changing their meal time to match my schedule. That's when I started to really think about why they kept coming around and why they needed to go out on a date while I was there at work. Like, was I really that great of a chef here? So during my break one time, I decided to Walk over and ask them why they kept coming around to have a date specifically. While I was on the clock, my ex girlfriend sipped on her Sprite and asked, what do you mean? Are you saying we're doing this on purpose? I nodded and said, yeah, that's exactly what I was implying. She sighed and leaned back in her seat, crossing her arms before looking up at me and asking, are you just jealous? I sighed, feeling like I wasted my time and said, why would I be jealous when I'm the one who broke up with you in the first place? Her mouth flung open to argue back, but I tired my attention to Beanie and said.

Sarah's mother got five years for child endangerment. I got temporary custody, then permanent guardianship when Sarah turned 16.

The breakthrough came junior year, when Sarah aced the state chemistry exam. Suddenly, colleges were calling. Harvard, Stanford, Johns Hopkins. They all wanted her. But Sarah almost didn't apply anywhere. She was convinced she didn't deserve it, that someone like her couldn't become a doctor. I had to literally drive her to the guidance office and watch her submit applications. Medical school was worse.

Okay, is this, like, he has a pretty crazy search history that includes a kinky fetish type thing, or is it worse? No, it's worse. Um, so I was looking at his iPad because it's connected to his phone, and I had to reset our home, like, security system, and he keeps the code on there in his note section. So I was getting the code, and I noticed one of the sections in his note that was called Gift Ideas. So I was like, hmm, maybe I'll take a quick peek, see if he picked up on the many hints that I've been leaving. Um, so wait. So, wait, so you snoop? So you're a Christmas gift snooper, then? For shame. Yeah, I know. I'm a bad person, but, uh, anyway, I was looking, and I see some. Some of the stuff he was thinking about getting the family and friends, and then I see a name, staff. And I'm like, hmm, I don't know a staff. Um, and I see he was planning on getting her, um, diamond stud earrings. So who. Who the heck is this staff person? So, to your knowledge, he doesn't have, like, a cousin staff or a sibling? It's not his mom's name or his grandma? No. No staff that I can think of at all. And I'm like, well, maybe this is just a coworker. Or a good friend. But still, like, is it even okay for a married man to buy. Be buying diamond earrings for a friend or a coworker? I mean. I mean, it kind of depends, all right? I mean, if it's somebody, maybe they're retiring after many years of working with him. Or are the diamonds, like, teeny, tiny cheapos? Listen, but even if they are, I don't know if a married man has any business buying diamond earrings for another woman for any reason. Has he ever bought you diamond earrings? Yeah, but many, many years ago. Okay, but see, he took care of his wife first. Then I don't know. I don't think there's any reason why a married man should be buying diamond earrings for another woman. See, that's exactly how I feel as well. So. Okay, what do you want us to do then, Casey? I like to know who this staff person is and why he's buying her diamond earring. Okay, well, I'm not sure if we can answer the second question, but we can definitely find out the more important one, which. Who is this staff person? And. And I'm assuming we can call your husband? Yes, absolutely. Okay. And what is his name? I don't think you ever told us. It's John. John. Okay, so hang on a sec, and then we'll get John's number from you, and then we will call him when we come back next. Hello? Hi, can I speak To John, please. Can I ask who's calling? Sure. This is the Z Morning Zoo radio show on Z1O4. Nick, Natalie and Shaggy. Is this John? It sure is. What's up, everybody? Not much. How are you this morning? I'm doing well. I'm doing real well, actually. I feel a lot better if you're about to tell me I won something, though. Oh, yeah? I wish that was why you were calling. Actually, we've been doing something really special on our show this week called Sexy Secret Santa, and that's why we called you. Okay, so the way it works is if somebody's got, like, a special person in their lives and they're kind of, like a secret, they call us and tell us to wish them a very sexy Christmas. Kind of lame, you know? I know. But listen, we got a call from Steph about you. I guess she said you were a very special person to her, so. Who is Steph

Your mom called me asking if I knew where you were. I told her you were in my house, in the bathroom, just to cover for you. But seriously, where are you? It's been a day now. Elio. Your mom's freaking out, and honestly, so am I. She called the police. I haven't told them that I lied for you. I keep telling her you're here, but I have no idea where you are. Please come home. I'm getting really worried. I asked my favorite astrology app, Astro App, for advice and it said that I'm a cancer, so I can get really emotional when I feel abandoned. It told me to take deep breaths and focus on grounding myself so I can stay calm and clear minded while waiting to hear from you. Elio, it's been a week. Everyone saying you're missing. Like actually missing. Your mom's been crying non stop and they filed a police report. Where are you? What's going on, Ello? It's been a month now. They still can't find you. I don't even know what to tell people anymore. I got a cat to help with the loneliness, I guess. I named him Charlie. Figured you'd like that. Wish you could see him. She's really sweet. Sleeps with me every night. She and was born on Valentine's Day too. Hahaha. It's been two months since you disappeared. I stopped writing to you because it felt like screaming into the void. Your mom's pregnant. Can You believe that? Guess there'll be another Elio around soon. I miss you so much, Elio. 10 months now. Your sister's almost here. Her name is going to be Julia. I keep hoping you'll walk through the door before she's born. Ello, it's been two years. I know that sounds insane, but part of me still thinks you're coming back. I can't move on from this. Everyone tells me to, but I can't. It's like a piece of me went missing with you. Hey. I need to tell you this. I'm getting married. I found someone who loves me. I think you'd like him. He's the love of my life. And I'm finally getting married. I asked for star rings so you'd be here with me in some way. I miss you more than ever right now. Ilio. It's been five years. I don't know what to say anymore. But I'm still here. They closed your case, the police. No one's looking for you anymore. But I'll never stop. I'm thinking of searching for you on my own, but in secret. Oh, and I'm pregnant. It's a boy. I'm naming him Ilio, after you. Hey. Wow. I didn't even realize we're still having this conversation. It's been seven years. My son's been born. Look. I think he looks a bit like you. He's as cute as you were. Or maybe that's just me imagining things. Wish you could see him. Hey, Elio. It's been 11 years. He's turning four today. Time flies, doesn't it? Feels like yesterday when I last saw you. He really admires you, you know. I always tell him how great you were as a boyfriend. He says you're still alive, that we're so connected. That's why I feel like you're still around. But I don't know. Sometimes I lose faith in you coming back. I wonder if he's right. I still feel you somehow, Ello. It's been 14 years. My new boyfriend tells me I need to move on. Says I'm holding on too tight. But my son, he still believes you're coming back. He's only a kid, but he has more faith than I do by now. It's been 20 years, Elio. Wow. My boy's nine now. He's getting so big. And guess what? I'm pregnant again. With a girl. She's due in four months, and I'm naming her Jula. Like your sister. Speaking of, your sister moved back in with your parents. She's not doing well. She barely speaks to anyone. It's like everything fell apart when you left. Elio, it's been 25 years. I built the house we dreamed of. Remember that? I also got divorced, though. He cheated on me. Now it's just me, Elio, Julia, and the cat. Still waiting for you, I guess. I miss you more than I can put into words, Elio. You have no idea. Every single day. Bria. The fuck you mean I died?

So beautiful that I was too scared to even go near her. That's the issue. She's perfect in every way. But I have fallen for someone else. Someone who I do speak to. Someone who understands me. Someone without a name or a face, but someone who loves me. The day you find out who I am, I Hope we will be together. Me too. Mystery girl. Can I confess something to you? Sure. What's up?

Would a senior be doing at a freshman party? Yeah, I know. That's the weird part. The girl he was talking to was a freshman. But it was 100% Logan. I'm sure of it. Like my personal beef with him aside, I don't think you should trust him anymore, Haley. And why would I choose to listen to you? I still trust Logan and he still loves me. What ever. Just know when he cheats on you. Or worse, don't come back apologizing for not believing me. Not happening, because he would never cheat on me. Haley, you have to break up with Logan right now. I already told you, I'm not listening to you. I don't care who you saw doing what. Haley, just listen for once. Remember the party that I saw Logan and the freshman at? You mean fake Logan? Yeah, I wanted to believe that too, but after today I'm 100% sure it's Logan. And why is that? I just saw the both of them at a cafe on like a date. Then when I made eye contact with Logan, he immediately got up and pretended he didn't know the freshman that he was talking to. If it wasn't the real Logan, why would he be scared of some random guy looking at him quickly? Maybe the guy just didn't wanna be seen talking to a freshman. I know Logan. He wouldn't do that. Oh yeah? Text him right now and ask him where he is. Alright, I will. Did you just text him? Five seconds ago? Yeah. How'd you know? I just saw him pull out his phone in the cafe. It's him. Haley, I'm sorry, but I did warn you earlier. It's probably just a coincidence. He just texted me that he was still at his house. Do you have his location? No. God, you're so naive, Haley. Kyle, what the hell did you do? I'm protecting you, that's what I'm doing. Logan just texted me that he's in the hospital and that a bunch of freshman boys jumped him so he couldn't hold off a few. Freshman? What? A baby? Oh my god. He said it was your friends. Kyle, this is too far. No, it isn't. I'm just trying to keep you safe from that absolute dirtbag. Don't talk to me again, Kyle. Why are you always trying to ruin my life? You'll see soon enough. Kyle, did the freshman that Logan was with have green eyes and wavy black hair? Yeah, her name is Rebecca. She also always wears this hoodie, I think. I can't remember how it looks like. Was it red? Yeah, that was it. It was a blank red hoodie. I'm sorry, Kyle.

Mine are all messed up. Sure. They're in my closet. Riley, why is there a huge coffee stain on those leggings I let you borrow two days ago? Oh, my god, that's horrible. I don't know how that could have happened. Sucks for you, though. Just don't make this longer than it has to be, okay? I'm sorry. It was an accident. I'm so sick of you borrowing my things and messing them up. Kylie, you're my big sister. This is part of the job description, honey. Kylie, can I use your laptop to play this game that all my friends are playing together? Go ahead. I love you. Um, Kylie, I kind of messed up. You'll see when you get home. What now? Riley? Why is my laptop not turning on? I was drinking water, and then I swear to god, I felt something push me in my back. It spilt all over the laptop. I'm so sorry, Kylie. I tried wiping it down and everything. Well, there's $900 down the drain. It's okay, Riley. You're the golden girl who can do no wrong. That's what mom would say, right? Are you mad? No, I'm just ecstatic. What do you think? Riley? Riley, what have you done to my makeup? Oh, yeah, I was going to tell you about that. I had a little accident. A little accident? You ruined everything! I'm sorry, Kylie. I didn't mean 2. One thing just Broke. And then everything else followed. You need to be taught a lesson, Riley. I've had enough. Mom, Riley just destroyed $500 worth of my makeup and ruined the bathroom sink in the process. How bad is it? What is wrong with you? Kylie, I'm genuinely interested to see how you're going to flip this onto me. She might be 15, but I wasn't doing things like this at her age. Why on earth would you spend that much money on makeup? That mess is fixable. But you wouldn't have been this angry if it wasn't so expensive. And for what? To paint your face? You know what? I'm not even going to engage in this. Kylie, why is your door locked? Because I'm out. And I don't want you to go in there and cause World War 3. That makeup thing was the last straw. Riley, you know I love you, but this is unacceptable. We're family. We have to share with each other. You're my big sister. I tried to do the right thing. From now on, if you want to use my things, you're going to have to pay me. Pay you with what money? I don't have a job. Figure it out. I'm telling Mommy. Of course you are. Kylie, why are you acting like this toward your little sister? I tried doing it the nice way, mom. It didn't work. Well, when you come back, your things are going to be packed in a suitcase. What? If you two can't live with each other, then it's way easier for you to move out rather than her. You're 19 now anyway. It's about time. I'm sorry, honey. This is the only way. No, it's not. You better lock your sweet Riley in a room or something, because it won't be pretty when I see that little brat.

My seven year old sister Daniela was singing in the back seat behind me when a truck ran the red light and slammed into us at top speed. By the time the car stopped flipping, Daniela became permanently silent. After hours trying to save her, the doctors told us she was gone. Mom climbed into the hospital bed and pulled Daniela against her chest, rocking her for three hours. Mommy's here, baby. Dad just stood frozen when the nurses pried my sister from Mom's arms. And while they fought, I threw up, knowing I survived and Daniela didn't. The first few weeks blurred together with mom crying in Danielle's room for hours. Dad would hold her shoulders and whisper that everything would be okay. I kept making her chamomile tea, but the cups always went cold on the nightstand. She couldn't stop staring at Danielle things long enough to drink them. Our grief therapist said this was normal and everyone processes loss differently. So we didn't worry when mom started making Daniela's bed every morning. Or arrange the stuffed animals in perfect rows, just how Daniela liked them. We thought maybe this ritual was helping her cope with the loss. The day Daniela would have turned 9, mom showed up with a wrapped birthday present, saying she'd already bought it before the accident. An obvious lie, but dad and I let it slide because what harm could one gift do To an already broken family. A month later, mom walked through the door carrying a life size doll that looked exactly like Daniela, with real human hair and her exact shade. She sat me down to show how she could brush his hair, just like Daniela's bedtime routine. I forced myself to nod, my heart breaking from the desperate sight. The next few days spiraled out of control. Mom dressed the doll in new outfits every morning and took it everywhere in Daniela's wagon. She did both voices like the doll could actually respond. People at the mall grabbed their children and hurried away from us. Dad found the three thousand dollar credit card charge. When he confronted her, she clutched the doll, screaming, you can't put a price on our daughter! He started sleeping on the couch that night. Things got worse when she pulled me out of school claiming it was too dangerous. She set up homeschooling with three play settings at our kitchen table. Week after week, I sat there watching her teach that doll alongside me. Until one morning I couldn't take it anymore. One morning I finally snapped and said, stop it! Daniela is gone! Mom sobbed. You abandoned her in that car and now you're doing it again! The guilt hit me so hard I couldn't breathe. I'm here too, I mumbled, while she cradled that doll like a real child, while tears streamed down her face. Two weeks after dad left, mom started Acting strange, she'd leave the doll behind and disappear, returning with stories about her wonderful new friend and the woman's precious daughter. I found her phone with Daniela's photo replaced by a stranger's child. She has Daniela's exact laugh, mom said. Behind me, her eyes.

Take all the time you need, mom purred in a voice I'd never heard before. The second their car turned the corner, something in Mom's face shifted into pure predator. She grabbed the girl's wrist hard enough to leave marks and dragged her toward Daniela's room. Welcome home, baby. The girl's confusion turned to fear. My name is not Daniela. It's Katie, she, I whispered. The sound of Mom's palm hitting her face made me flinch. You are Daniela, Mom shrieked. Everything accelerated into a nightmare. Mom commanded Katie to undress, but when she shook her head, mom grabbed the Scissors from Daniela's desk. Katie tried to bolt, but mom caught her by the hair. I watched frozen in horror as she cut through Katie's clothes with violent precision, humming Daniela's lullaby. Katie stood there exposed and sobbing while mom forced Daniela's tiny dress over her head. Bathroom became a torture chamber. Mom dragged the screaming girl in while I watched in horror. Through the mirror, I watched mom slather bleach on her hair. I want my mommy, she wailed. I am your mommy. Mom, god gave you back to me. In one desperate moment, when mom turned for more dye, Katie scooped bleach and smeared it across Mom's eyes. Mom's Scream was inhuman. As she clawed at her face, Katie sprinted out and yelled for help. I flew downstairs and dove into the pantry with my phone. I whispered frantically to 9, 1, 1 while Katie sobs mixed with Mom's rage above us. Those minutes waiting for sirens felt like hours. When they finally broke down Daniela's door, they found mom sitting calmly on the bed, brushing both Katie's hair and the dolls. My two danielas have finally met, she announced proudly. Katie threw herself at the officers while mom fought like a wild animal, screaming, don't take my babies again, even as they wrestled her into handcuffs. The little girl's mom placed a restraining order on our family and Mom's been institutionalized 8 months now. Last time I visited, she grabbed my hand and whispered, I forgive you for sending Daniela away again. She smiled and for a moment I thought I saw a glimpse of mom I had before the crash until she mentioned another patient had Daniela's exact laugh. After that, dad and I cleaned out Daniela's room together and donated everything, including that horrible doll.

After that, dad and I cleaned out Daniela's room together and donated everything, including that horrible doll.

Mother. My 7 year old sister Daniela was singing in the back seat behind me when a truck ran the red light and slammed into us at top speed. By the time the car stopped flipping, Daniela became permanently silent. After hours trying to save her, the doctors told us she was gone. Mom climbed into the hospital bed and pulled Daniela against her chest, rocking her for three hours. Mommy's here, baby. Dad just stood frozen when the nurses pried my sister from Mom's arms. And while they fought, I threw up knowing I survived and Daniela didn't. First few weeks blurred together with mom crying in Danielle's room for hours. Dad would hold her shoulders and whisper that everything would be okay. I kept making her chamomile tea, but the cups always went cold on the nightstand. She couldn't stop staring at Danielle things long enough to drink them. Our grief therapist said this was normal and everyone processes loss differently. So we didn't worry. When mom started making Daniela's bed every morning or arrange the stuffed animals in perfect rows just how Daniela liked them, we thought maybe this ritual was helping her cope with the loss. The day Daniela would have turned 9, mom showed up with a wrapped birthday present saying she'd already bought it before the accident, an obvious lie. But dad and I let it slide because what harm could one gift do to An already broken family. A month later, mom walked through the door carrying a life size doll that looked exactly like Daniela with real human hair and her exact shade. She sat me down to show how she could brush his hair just like Daniela's bedtime routine. Forced myself to nod, my heart breaking from the desperate sight. The next few days spiraled out of control. Mom dressed the doll in new outfits every morning and took it everywhere. In Daniela's wagon. She did both voices like the doll could actually respond. At the mall, grabbed their children and hurried away from us. Dad found the 3,000 dollar credit card charge. When he confronted her, she clutched the doll screaming, you can't put a price on our daughter. He started sleeping on the couch that night. Things got worse when she pulled me out of school claiming it was too dangerous. She set up homeschooling with three play settings at our kitchen table. Week after week, I sat there watching her teach that doll alongside me until one morning I couldn't take it anymore. One morning I finally snapped and said, stop it, Daniela is gone, mom sobbed. You abandoned her in that car and now you're doing it again. Guilt hit me so hard I couldn't breathe. I'm here too, I mumbled while she cradled that doll like a real child while tears streamed down her face. Two weeks after dad left, mom started acting strange. She leave the Doll behind and disappear, returning with stories about her wonderful new friend and the woman's precious daughter. I found her phone with Daniela's photo replaced by a stranger's child. She has Daniela's exact laugh, mom said, behind me, her eyes.

An exhausted woman stood there clutching her purse, thanking mom over and over for babysitting. Behind her, a girl about 11 with dark hair hung back, clearly uneasy. Take all the time you need, mom purred in a voice I'd never heard before. The second their car turned the corner, something in Mom's face shifted into pure predator. She grabbed the girl's wrist hard enough to leave marks and dragged her toward Daniela's room. Welcome home, baby. The girl's confusion turned to fear. My name is not Daniela. It's Katie, she, I whispered. The sound of Mom's palm hitting her face made me flinch. You are Daniela, Mom shrieked. Everything accelerated into a nightmare. Mom commanded Katie to undress, but when she shook her head, mom grabbed the Scissors from Daniela's desk. Katie tried to bolt, but mom caught her by the hair. I watched frozen in horror as she cut through Katie's clothes with violent precision, humming Daniela's lullaby. Katie stood there exposed and sobbing while mom forced Daniela's tiny dress over her head. Bathroom became a torture chamber. Mom dragged the screaming girl in while I watched in horror. Through the mirror, I watched mom slather bleach on her hair. I want my mommy, she wailed. I am your mommy. Mom, god gave you back to me. In one desperate moment, when mom turned for more dye, Katie scooped bleach and smeared it across Mom's eyes. Mom's Scream was inhuman. As she clotted her face, Katie sprinted out and yelled for help. I flew downstairs and dove into the pantry. With my phone, I whispered frantically to 9 1, 1 while Katie sobs mixed with Mom's rage above us. Those minutes waiting for sirens felt like hours. When they finally broke down Daniela's door, they found mom sitting calmly on the bed, brushing both Katie's hair and the dolls. My two danielas have finally met, she announced proudly.

How do I turn on the AC? I turned it on and it got hot. Which car did you take? The Toyota. The purple car? My BMW M3 competition. I'm trying to learn how to drift. What? Why didn't you call me? You wouldn't want to teach me anyway. Now help me. What did I do wrong? You probably turned on the heater. Press the snowflake button. It's not working. It started acting weird after I refueled it. You refueled my car? Yeah. I put some diesel that was on sale. You put what diesel? Yeah. Why? Didn't know your car was that picky. Picky. It's a BMW M3 Competition Turbo with 1,000 horsepower. Oh, that's why it whistles. My ex used to say his car was the most powerful, but honestly, it didn't seem like much powerful than mine. Doubt it. I bet he had to take his car to therapy just to feel like it was fast enough to compensate for everything else. He was like, that was good. What car did he have? It had 2 doors and was really loud. Had to roll up the windows because of the noise. Yeah, cars are like that. Unlike my BMW, which whistles, his car didn't even drift. He just accelerated, but not too much because he always said he couldn't speed in the city. That's just an excuse for a weak car. And it only had one gear. How can a car. Be powerful with just one gear. Wait, you said one gear? Yeah. He never let me drive it. But how hard can it be to drive a car with one gear? What was the car like?

Your teachers always make things seem worse than they are. Stop making a big deal out Of everything. Mom, my arm changed color today. It's dark purple and parts are turning black.

It doesn't even feel attached anymore, like it's just hanging there. Then deal with it. Stop bothering me with your pathetic problems. Mom, my arm looks really bad, please. The skin doesn't look right. You probably did something to make it worse. Don't expect me to fix your mistakes. Mom, my arm feels loose, like it's barely hanging on anymore.

Wow. Hello, Mrs. Hack. My mother says never go to someone's house empty handed. So. Here. Cindy, you look gorgeous. I wanted to wear my hat, but my mom said no. My ears are freezing. Hmm. Here's your flower in a box, Rick. You have to pin it on her. Oh, sorry. What happened? Should we get in the car and follow him? Frankie, our son, who has a driver's license, is heading to prom with someone who he can legitimately call his girlfriend. Did you ever in your life think that was gonna happen? I think he's doing fine. But did you see how good Cindy look? Somebody at that dance is gonna swoop in there and snatch her up. And brick will be too busy reading the maximum occupancy sign to notice. Wow, this is so much better than going to prom. I don't get why parents think it's so important. I guess they're afraid we're gonna miss out on stuff. So we tell them we're going and it makes them happy. This really is the perfect night.

Your parents are co signers, not co owners. They have zero ownership rights. This notice is worthless. I had her draft a formal response, but I didn't send it yet. Instead, I did some digging. Turns out Henry had been borrowing heavily from mom and dad to fund his lifestyle. The wedding alone was costing $45,000, most of it fronted by our parents. Ashley's Instagram perfect life was built entirely on credit cards, maxed to $78,000. They were drowning and saw my house as their life raft. I waited, I played along. I even helped plan the wedding, volunteering to coordinate vendors since I was supposedly moving out anyway. Two weeks before the wedding, I made my move. I sent the legal response to my parents, copied to Henry and Ashley, clearly stated they had no ownership claim and the eviction notice was invalid. But that was just the opening act. I called every vendor, the photographer, the caterer, the florist, the venue. Hi, this is Ryan Mitchell calling about the Henry Mitchell wedding. I need to inform you that all payments made on credit card ending in 4, 7, 8, 2 need to be reversed. The card was reported stolen. It wasn't stolen. It was my parents card, which they'd added me as an authorized user on years ago for emergencies. I never removed myself. Technically, I had every right to dispute charges I didn't authorize. By Monday, every vendor had canceled The venue called my parents directly about the bounce deposit, the florist, the DJ, the caterer, everyone. My phone exploded with calls. I didn't answer. Henry showed up at my door three days before the wedding, desperate. You destroyed everything. Ashley's parents won't help. We have no venue, no photographer, nothing. I opened the door wider. That's terrible. Hey, wasn't there something about me needing to move out? How's that going? His face crumbled. Please, we'll drop it. Just fix this. No, I said simply, you wanted my house. I want you to understand what it feels like to lose something that matters. The wedding happened in my parents backyard. No photographer, grocery store cake, 20 people instead of 200. I drove by that day, saw Ashley crying in her discount dress, saw Henry's hollow eyes, saw my mother's face. Finally understand what they'd done. I never moved out. My house, my rules, and I've never felt more at home.

When I opened it, I found a notice telling me to move out of my own house. I smiled and a few months later returned the favor at their wedding. My 30th birthday started like any other family gathering. Mom insisted on hosting at my place because, quote, your house has the best space for everyone. I should have seen it coming. My younger brother Henry and his fiance Ashley showed up first, followed by my parents and extended family. Everyone seemed weirdly excited, exchanging knowing glances. Then came the moment before Cake. Mom announced, we have a very special gift for you, sweetheart. Ashley handed me an elegantly wrapped box with a bow. The room went silent as I untied the ribbon. Inside was a single envelope. No card, no note, just legal paperwork, 60 day notice to vacate my own house. I looked up slowly. Henry was grinning. Surprise, we bought your house. What? I said, still processing. Well, technically, we made an offer to mom and dad. Ashley chimed in. Since they co signed your mortgage five years ago, they're technically co owners. They agreed to sell us their share, which gives us majority ownership. So legally you're the tenant now. My mother smiled sweetly. We. this would be perfect for Henry and Ashley to start their marriage. You're always traveling for work anyway. You don't really need all this space. This is my house. I said quietly, I've paid every single mortgage payment for five years. Dad shrugged, but we're on the deed. That makes it partly ours. We're just exercising our rights. Henry leaned back smug. Don't make this dramatic, Ryan. Ashley and I need a real home for our future kids. You're single. You can rent somewhere smaller. The rage inside me was volcanic, but something else took over, cold calculation. I smiled. Wow, this is incredibly thoughtful. Everyone relaxed, interpreting my calm as acceptance. See, mom said, I knew you'd understand once you thought about it. I nodded, slowly setting the notice down. When's the wedding again? June 15th, Ashley said proudly at the Botanical Gardens. It's going to be magical. Can't wait, I replied, still smiling. That night, I called my real estate lawyer.

The finding out was biblical. I show up to practice Thursday night at the regular time, and my three bandmates are sitting in a circle without their instruments, like they're about to hold an intervention. Lead singer says, we need to talk about the band's future. Battle of bands is in 10 days, and apparently we need to level up our image. That's when I know it's the drummer's girlfriend standing in the corner holding a bass. My bass, actually, that I let him borrow last week. She's holding it upside down. Lead singer looks at me. Look, you're great and all, but she has the look we need. She's been learning bass for, like, two months. Two months? I've been carrying this band for three years. But sure, let's get the girl who thinks a bass has six strings. They vote 3 to 1 to replace me right there with me watching like I'm getting voted off a reality show. The guitarist, who still can't play an F chord cleanly, actually says, it's nothing personal. Nobody's looking at the bassist anyway. Might as well have someone pretty back there. Nobody's looking at the bassist. I wrote half our songs, but okay, Brad, tell me more about how music works. The drummer's girlfriend tries to be nice. You can still come to the show if you want to support us. Support them. Sure. Let me buy a ticket to watch you play my bass badly. Sounds like a Dream Friday night. I don't argue, don't yell. Just say okay if that's what you all want. The lead singer seems surprised I'm not fighting back. Probably expected tears. Sorry to disappoint. They're already talking about keeping the band name and the set list for battle of bands. Acting like everything's normal. Planning tomorrow's practice like I was never even there. Like I'm already a ghost. Guitarist mentions they'll see me around and I just nod, give them a smile that doesn't reach my eyes, walk out quietly. I can hear them talking about stage positions as the door closes. How she'll look right in the back, how the judges will love having something nice to look at. They think this is over. They think I'm just going to crawl away and cry. That's cute. I'm sitting in my car in the driveway and my brain starts doing math. Tomorrow's practice. They kept saying see you at practice tomorrow to each other. But wait, that's my amp the guitarist uses because his sounds like a dying cat. My mixing board that makes our lead singer not sound like he's through a kazoo. The mic system I bought with birthday money. The cables, the stands, hell, even the extension cords are mine. I check the battle of bands registration on my phone. The song list they submitted. Breaking Chains I wrote that. Midnight Drive wrote that in my bedroom. Phoenix Rising? That's literally about my ex boyfriend. I have the notebooks. With the original lyrics in my handwriting. The van we use for gigs. Mine. Well, technically my mom's, but she lets me use it. And then it hits me. This is my dad's garage. Dad only lets them practice here because of me. I text him, hey, the band just kicked me out for not being pretty enough. He texts back immediately. Are you kidding me? They're banned. I'll change the garage code right now. My dad's the best. They kept saying, see you at practice tomorrow. They actually think they're still practicing here tomorrow. In my dad's garage. With my equipment, playing my songs. The delusion is actually impressive. Next day, five PM, I'm home.

Kyle blocked the door. She doesn't want you here. Security had to remove him. My daughter Emma was born 4 pounds, spent three weeks in NICU. I was there every day. Sarah and Kyle showed up twice. I overheard Kyle saying once she's home and healthy, we can get back to normal. Like my daughter was an inconvenience. I won primary custody. Sarah got supervised visitation she rarely used. Two years passed. I focused on Emma, my career rebuilding. Then dad called your mother and I updated our will. Kyle's getting the house and business. You've always been self sufficient. I stopped going to family events. Emma and I built our own traditions. Last month, dad had a massive stroke. Mom followed two weeks later. The will reading was brutal. Kyle showed up in a new BMW, Sarah on his arm, already spending money they didn't have. The lawyer read the will. My parents had changed it three weeks before Dad's stroke. Everything to me, the house, the business, stocks, life insurance, nearly $2 million total. Kyle's face went purple. There was a letter attached. We watched Kyle destroy Nathan's life for our approval. We enabled his cruelty. We rejected our grandson. We were wrong about everything. Kyle exploded. This is fraud. He was wrong. The lawyer had medical evaluations proving they were completely lucid. Within a week, Kyle's life collapsed. The BMW was repossessed. Sarah left him. He lost the guest house. When I sold It yesterday, he showed up at my door, hollow eyed and desperate. I need help. I'm your brother. I looked at him and saw the man who'd slept with my wife, stolen my chance at being present for my daughter's birth and laughed while doing it. You're right, I said. You are my brother. That's why this hurts so much. I'll give you one thing, the number for the same therapist I used to process what you all put me through. The rest you figure out yourself. I closed the door. Emma called from her room asking who it was. Just someone who used to be important, I told her, but not anymore. Some bridges don't deserve rebuilding.

I want a divorce, she said, not quite meeting my eyes. I nodded slowly, okay, I'll have my lawyer contact yours. Her face lit up, not with sadness, with relief. She even let a small smile slip. That's when I knew I'd made the right call. Her lawyer sent the initial filing three days later. The demands were breathtaking. Half of everything, including my business, spousal support for five years, the house, even my grandfather's inheritance that she'd never been entitled to. My lawyer's response was a work of art, 47 pages detailing every asset move I'd made, every legal justification, every time stamp proving these were legitimate business decisions made before any divorce filing. We attached the photos of her notebook, the calculations, the planning. Most devastating was the evidence of her affair, because once I started looking, I found it. Hotel charges on a credit card I'd forgotten she had access to. Text messages with someone named David, her personal trainer, David, the one she'd been seeing three times a week for six months. Her lawyer called mine within 24 hours. We need to talk. Sophie showed up at the house that night, mascara running. You moved everything. You planned this. No, I said calmly. You planned this. I just protected myself. She started crying, real tears. This time I made A mistake? Can we work this out? Maybe counseling? I showed her the text messages with David, the hotel receipts. Was this a mistake, too? Her face went pale. The final settlement was nothing like her original demands. No business stake, no inheritance, no spousal support, just an even split of actual marital assets. And she had to cover her own legal fees. Last week, she sent me a long email about how I manipulated everything, how I planned this from the beginning, how I was vindictive and cruel. I read it once, then deleted it. She was right about one thing, though. I did plan it just two weeks before she filed. But that was enough. In the end, her biggest mistake wasn't the affair. It was leaving that notebook where I could find.

Now he wants my help. After our parents disowned him and left me their two million dollar inheritance. I'm the oldest son, the responsible one. My brother Kyle is 32. Charming, entitled. Never held a job longer than six months. Growing up, he was the golden child while I was invisible. When I got into medical school, my parents said it was expected. When Kyle got a participation trophy, they threw a party. I met Sarah during residency. We married young, built what I believed was a solid life. Kyle lived in our guest house rent free because he was between opportunities. That's what mom always called his constant unemployment. Things felt off for months. Sarah working late. Kyle suddenly motivated to help around the house when I wasn't home. Then came my 35th birthday dinner at my parents house. I walked in early and found them, my wife, my brother, in my childhood bedroom. Kyle laughed. Dude, chill. It just happened. My parents rushed in. Mom's first words, don't overreact, Nathan. These things are complicated. Dad pulled me aside. Your brothers finally found happiness. Maybe this is good for everyone. My wife was sleeping with my brother and they wanted me to be happy about it. I filed for divorce that week. Family pressure started immediately. You're being selfish. Sarah's pregnant and you're going to deny your brother his chance at being a father? That's when it hit Me pregnant. We've been trying for two years with no success. Sarah blamed stress, but Kyle had only been in the picture for four months. I demanded a paternity test. Kyle refused. Sarah cried about trust. My parents called me paranoid. So I made it a condition of the divorce settlement. The results came back mine. The baby was mine. They'd stolen my child before I even knew they existed. Kyle moved Sarah into my parents house. They threw her a baby shower, bought everything. I wasn't invited. I watched on social media while my family celebrated my wife carrying my baby with my brother playing dad. Sarah went into premature labor at 32 weeks.

Two weeks later, she filed, then backtracked when her plan backfired. The signs were everywhere, but I was too stupid to see them at first. My wife, Sophie, had suddenly become obsessed with our finances. After 11 years of marriage, where she couldn't care less about bank statements, she was suddenly asking detailed questions about my investments, my retirement accounts, even my late grandfather's inheritance. The breaking point came when I found a notebook hidden in her car, pages of handwritten calculations, asset divisions, property evaluations, my business worth. The bottom of one page in her handwriting, community, property, state, 50% minimum, more with good lawyer. My hands were shaking when I photographed every page and put it back exactly where I found it. That night at dinner, Sophie smiled at me like nothing was wrong. How was your day, honey? All I could think about was that notebook, the calculations, the cold surgical way she'd written out how to take half of everything I'd spent 15 years building. I didn't confront her. I did something smarter. The next morning, I called my old college roommate, Marcus, now a divorce attorney in another state. I need advice and I need it quiet. Within 48 hours, I had a legal strategy. Every move carefully documented, every step defensible. I started with the business, my software company that I'd founded before we even met. I restructured it, making It clear that assets pre dating the marriage were separate property. I quietly moved my grandfather's inheritance into a separate trust, exactly as his will had originally specified. All perfectly legal, all documented with time stamps and legal justifications. Joint accounts were trickier. I couldn't just drain them. That would look bad in court. Instead, I methodically documented every expense, every time Sophie bought designer handbags with my earnings, every spa weekend, every girl's trip to Cabo. I wasn't being petty. I was building a case. Two weeks after I found that notebook, Sophie came home looking nervous. She.

Here's the pawn shop receipt for Grandma's engagement ring. The one that went missing in 2013. You blamed me for that, too, remember? Said I probably sold it for drug money. I turned the phone toward Mom. Vincent's signature, April 2,013. On for $800. My cousin Jordan whispers, holy shit. Vincent's face is red now. That's not my signature. Anyone could have forged that. The pawn shop had security footage, too, but they only keep it for seven years. Uncle Mitchell is staring at Vincent with this look of pure disgust. You son of a. Wait. I interrupt. There's more. I swipe to the next photo. This is the insurance claim Vincent filed in 2014 for a break in that never happened. Claimed $12,000 in stolen electronics and jewelry. Mom's hands are shaking. We split that money. You said we needed it for the roof repair, right? I say, except I pulled the insurance investigation report. They suspected fraud, but couldn't prove it. The serial numbers Vincent provided, they didn't match any purchase items. He made them up. Vincent's already moving toward the door, but Devon's blocking the exit.

Uncle Mitchell's yelling. Aunt Rachel's crying. My cousins are all talking at once. Mom walks around the table and wraps her arms around me. She's sobbing into my shoulder. I'm so sorry.

I set my fork down, smiled and said, that's exactly why I invited him tonight. Growing up in Portland, my stepdad, Vincent, controlled everything, the thermostat, the grocery list, who mom talked to on the phone. When I was 16, he convinced mom to kick me out, saying I was stealing from them. I wasn't, but mom believed him and I spent my senior year couch surfing between friends houses, finishing school while working at a gas station. Vincent had this way of making everything seem reasonable. Chloe's been acting different. He'd tell mom money's going missing, I found empty boxes in her room. All lies. But he was patient. He built the story slowly over months until mom had no choice but to believe him. I tried explaining, showed her my bank statements, my work schedule, everything. But Vincent was already three steps ahead. He planted evidence, twisted conversations, made me look unstable for even defending myself. The night mom told me to leave, Vincent stood behind her with this satisfied smirk I'll never forget. Fast forward 12 years. I'm a physical therapist now married to Devon. Able life in Seattle. Mom's been trying to reconcile for the past two years. Sunday phone calls, holiday texts, the whole routine. But Vincent's still in the picture, still playing victim about how I abandoned the family and broke Mom's heart. Tonight at Mom's 60th birthday dinner at this Italian place downtown, my Uncle Mitchell doesn't know Vincent sitting three seats down when he makes that comment. I'd specifically arranged the seating so they be separated by other family members. The table goes completely silent, 15 people, mid bite, frozen. Vincent's fork clatters against his plate. I've been preparing for this moment for months. I pull out my phone, open my photos. Mom, remember when Vincent said I stole $3,000 from you guys, that's why you kicked me out? She nodded slowly, her wine glass halfway to her lips. I swiped to a bank statement from 2,012. This shows Vincent withdrew that exact amount from your joint account the same week. So Tember 14th, 2,012. Then blamed me three days later. Mom's face drains of color. She sets down her glass. My Aunt Rachel leans in to look. Is that real? Bank of America confirmed it last month. I say I request.

Really? There's a letter, too, in the safe deposit box. You'll understand when you read it. She fell asleep. After that, I didn't think much about it. Tyler had always been the one, the successful one, the one who deserved everything. Four days later, early morning, Mom's heart gave out. Peaceful, no pain. I was holding her hand. Tyler arrived an hour after she passed, cried loudly in the hallway, made a scene. At the reading of the will, Tyler sat across from me, confident, smug. The lawyer read through everything. House to Tyler, stocks split evenly, savings to dad, then and to Nathan. I leave my wedding ring and all family photo albums. Tyler actually laughed. Seriously, photos. The lawyer handed me an envelope. Your mother left this for you. I opened it later alone. Inside was a handwritten note on Mom's stationery. Asterisk, Nate. Asterisk, asterisk. Tyler will get what he values, money, property, things he can show off. Asterisk, asterisk. You get what mattered to me, the Memories we made when no one was watching. The quiet mornings, the recipes we tested together, the walks in the park. Asterisk, asterisk. He chose success. You chose presents. Asterisk, asterisk. I saw you every time, every moment. You thought no one noticed, asterisk, asterisk. Where my ring? Remember, I loved you exactly as you are. Asterisk, asterisk, mom, asterisk. I sat on my bedroom floor and cried for an hour. Tyler called that night. This is garbage. You manipulated her. I was just there, Tyler. You poisoned her against me. I hung up. At the funeral, Tyler sat in the back, didn't speak, left before the reception. Dad pulled me aside. She talked about you constantly those last months. Said you reminded her of her father. Kind, steady. I wore Mom's ring on a chain around my neck. And at the reception when someone asked.

The room laughed. A week later, when our mom landed in the hospital, I was the only one who showed up and the only one she asked for. Growing up, Tyler was the golden child, straight A's, med school, married his college sweetheart, three kids, big house in the suburbs, club membership. I was just the other one, the guy who chose teaching over money, who bought a modest townhouse. Instead of keeping up appearances at family dinners, mom would brag about Tyler's latest achievement, his new car, his promotion, his kid, it's private school. I'd sit there nodding, smiling. My 40th birthday fell on a Saturday. My wife Claire threw a small dinner, both our families. I'd spent all afternoon making tiramisu from scratch, Mom's old recipe, the one she used to make for special occasions. Tyler took one look and smirked. Look at that. Nate finally did something useful. The table erupted in laughter. Dad chuckled. Tyler's wife grinned. Even my own kids giggled. Claire's smile was tight. I set the dessert down, forced to laugh. Yeah, that's me, Mister Useful. I cut everyone a slice, ate mine in silence, left early, blamed a headache. Claire squeezed my hand in the car. He's an ass family, I said. A week later, my phone rang at 2:00am. Dad's voice was shaking. Your mom collapsed at Mercy, General. I threw on clothes, grabbed my keys. The hospital was 35 minutes away. I made it in 22. Dad was in the waiting room, pale, hands trembling. Called him, he's coming. I sat with dad until 4:00am. Finally, a doctor came out. She's stable. You can see her. Mom looked small in that bed, tubes everywhere, monitors beeping. Her eyes opened. When I walked in, Nate, she whispered. I took her hand. I'm here, mom. Don't leave. I won't. Tyler showed up at 8:00am, hair perfect, Starbucks cup in hand. Traffic, he said, not looking at me. Mom was awake by then, groggy but alert. She looked past Tyler. Squeeze my hand tighter. Where were you, she asked him. Tyler blinked. I'm here now. Mom had to arrange coverage at the practice. She pulled her hand from his kids to get ready for school. So does he, mom said quietly. He was just here. Tyler's jaw tightened. He stayed for 20 minutes, then left. I stayed for three days, sleeping in the chair beside her bed, bringing dad coffee, talking to doctors.

I'm sure we'd like to make this right. What would it take? I'd already started my new job. Better office, better salary, a boss who said thank you. Nothing. I told the VP, but you should know, Derek's been taking credit for deals. He didn't close my deals. If you check the emails, the contracts, you'll see my name, not his. There was a long pause. We'll look into that. Day 8, the calls escalated. The Harrington account had questions. Payments were delayed. They've been working with me, not Derek. They wanted me back on the account or they'd walk. Derek called six times that day. I ignored everyone. Day 9, my former colleague Sarah texted me, Derek just got fired. They brought in all his clients. Half of them said they only worked with the company because of you. The VP found the emails. You mentioned Derek had been falsifying reports for two years. I smiled, didn't respond. Week 2, at my new job, I closed a 1.8 million dollar deal. My new boss called me into his office. I'm impressed. That's exceptional work. Thank you, I said. It's nice to be appreciated. Week 3, Derek showed up at my new office building. Security called me. I went down to the lobby. He looked smaller, somehow deflated. I made a mistake. He, I underestimated you. Yes, you did. Can you help me? I'm struggling to find work. Your reputation followed you. I said, turns out when you take credit, For other people's wins. Those people remember I can put in a good word somewhere. I considered it for about two seconds. Eric, anyone could do your job. You're easily replaceable. His face fell. That's not fair. Fair, I smiled. You spent years making people feel worthless, stealing credit, breaking them down. And now that you're on the other side, you want fairness? I turned to walk away. Wait, he called out. What do I do now? Learn, I said over my shoulder. Learn that people aren't replaceable. Relationships matter. Respect matters. And when you treat people like they're nothing, don't be surprised when they prove you wrong. I never saw Derek again. Heard through the Grapevine, he took a job three levels below where he'd been heard. His new boss was exactly like he used to be. Karma's funny that way. Six months later, I got promoted. My team closed $12 million in deals that quarter. At the Celebration dinner, my boss raised a glass to irreplaceable people. I smiled and thought of Derek, of his smirk, of his cruelty. Anyone can do your job. He'd meant it as an insult, as a way to keep me small. Instead, it became the push I needed to realize my worth and to find people who saw it too replaceable, not even close.

You're easily replaceable. I nodded, finished my coffee, and walked out. One week later, he called, begging, but I just laughed. Anyone could do your job. You're easily replaceable. My boss, Derek, said it in front of the entire sales team, 12 people watching. He leaned back in his chair, smirking. We've got 50 resumes for every position. Don't ever think you're special. This wasn't new. Derek had a pattern. Public humiliation, power plays. He built his management style on making people feel small. Most people took it, followed their pride, stayed because they needed the paycheck. I used to be one of them. But three months earlier, something changed. I closed the Harrington account. $2.4 million, our biggest deal in five years. Derek took credit in the executive meeting, told the VP it was his strategy, his relationship building. My name never came up. When I confronted him privately, he laughed. That's how this works. I'm the manager. Your wins are my wins. Get used to it or leave. I didn't leave. Not then. Instead, I started documenting everything. Every client I brought in, every relationship I built, every deal I closed. I backed up emails, saved contracts with my signature, recorded call logs. Then I started making calls discreetly. To competitors, to former colleagues who'd escape Derek's department, to recruiters who specialized in enterprise sales. By the time Derek said I was replaceable, I had three job offers. Each one paid more. Better titles, better bosses. But I wasn't ready to leave yet. Not until Derek understood exactly what he was losing. So when he said those words, anyone could do your job. I just nodded, finished my coffee, stood up and said, you're right, Derek. Anyone can do my job. Good luck finding them. I walked out of the conference room, grabbed my personal items from my desk. Laptop, photos, the signed baseball from the Harrington deal that Derek didn't know about. In 15 minutes, I was gone. No two weeks notice, no dramatic speech. Just gone. The first call came two days later. Derek's assistant. There's been a misunderstanding. Derek wants to talk. I declined. The second call came on Day 4. Derek himself. Look, maybe I was too harsh. Let's grab coffee and work this out. I told him I'd already accepted another position. He sputtered. You can't just leave. We have active deals. Exactly. I said, you do? Hope you can close them.

So I showed the board her portfolio of Instagram filters and motivational quotes. The email came on a Tuesday morning. We need to talk about bringing Amanda on full time. Conference room at 2. I stared at the message from Kyle, my business partner. We'd started the marketing agency together four years ago, built it from nothing to $2.3 million in annual revenue, 12 employees, real clients, real growth. Amanda was Kyle's wife. She help with some social media posts when we first launched, mostly Instagram stories, inspirational quotes over sunset photos. I walked into the conference room at 2. Kyle was already there, so was Amanda. Thanks for meeting, Kyle said. We've been talking and Amanda wants to come on board full time. Doing what? Creative director. Amanda said she had a folder, actual printed materials. I've been developing a vision for where the agency should go. We need to elevate our brand presence. She opened the folder. Inside were printouts of Instagram posts, motivational quotes and cursive fonts. Choose joy, hustle harder, dream big. This is our current aesthetic, she said. It's fine for where we were, but if we want to compete with the big agencies, we need to be bold, disruptive. Look at Kyle. He was notting along. What kind of role are you thinking, I asked. Creative director. I'd oversee all client campaigns, manage the design team, set the visual direction. For the company, we already have a creative director, Maria. She's been with us three years. Maria is talented, Amanda said, but she doesn't have the strategic vision we need to scale. Maria had a degree from Parsons, 10 years of agency experience. She'd won two regional Addy Awards for campaign she'd LED for us. What's your background? I asked Amanda. I have an associate degree in communications and I've been managing my personal brand for six years. 23,000 Instagram followers. Managing your personal brand? Yes. Content strategy, visual identity, audience engagement. It's the same skill set just applied to corporate clients. Kyle cleared his throat. The salary would be $95,000, same as Maria. My stomach dropped. 95,000. It's market rate for a creative director. What companies? We looked at industry standards, Amanda said. Glass Door shows creative directors at agencies our size making between 85 k and 110 k. Those are people with portfolios, with client work, with degrees. Amanda's face hardened. I have a portfolio. She pulled out more pages, Instagram posts from her personal account. A mood board she made on Canva, a list of brand values that included authenticity and empowerment. This isn't a portfolio, I said. This is a Pinterest board. Excuse me. You've never worked at an agency. You've never managed a client. You've never LED a design team. You want nothing.

Our other neighbor looked genuinely confused. You mean the happy sounds? My kids love hearing it. They think he's having the best time out there. They asked me when he's coming out to play. That's not happiness. The woman was losing it. Now that's a disturbance that needs professional intervention. My other neighbor smiled. My brother's autistic. What you're describing is completely normal and healthy. The husband tried to salvage things. Look, we're all reasonable adults here. We're just looking for some kind of compromise. Quieter hours, maybe? My wife stepped forward. Should we drug our child into silence so you're comfortable? Is that what you want? We're not saying that at all. He backed up. Just better timing for outdoor activities when fewer people are around. He goes out when he needs to, and we're not scheduling his emotions around your convenience. The woman grabbed her papers and clutched them tight. Fine. The HOA will handle you people, since you clearly have zero respect for this neighborhood. She stormed off down the driveway. Her husband followed, looking embarrassed. Three days later, the HOA sent us a letter about noise complaints and threatening behavior. I called the president immediately. He let out this long, exhausted sigh when I explained the situation. She's been emailing me multiple times every day for weeks now. I keep telling her a kid playing in his own yard isn't a violation of anything. She wants us to create New rules, specifically about this. She threatening to sue the HOA if we don't take action. I told her that's not how any of this works. Last week, I saw her at the grocery store yelling at a teenage cashier about expired coupons. Her daughter was standing right there looking mortified. The girl spotted my son down the aisle, and her face lit up. She waved at him. He waved back with a shy smile. The neighbor's head whipped around. She snatched her daughter's hand and yanked her toward the exit. She stared us down with pure hatred as she dragged her kid out the door. A month later, a for sale sign appeared in their front yard. The realtor came by our house one afternoon. I wanted to give you advanced notice that we'll be doing showings this weekend. Would it be possible to keep things quiet during those times? Keep what quiet, exactly? Your son. The previous owners mentioned he can be quite loud, and I'd prefer potential buyers don't hear anything that might impact her decision. My son lives here. He'll be doing whatever he normally does. She tried to force a smile. I completely understand. But maybe just for a few hours on Saturday and Sunday. I said no and shut the door. They ended up selling below asking price after three months.

My neighbor banged on my door at 7:00am. Your son screams every weekend and I'm done being polite about it. What are you talking about? The noise from your backyard. It happens every Saturday and Sunday like clockwork. The whole street hears it and my daughter thinks someone is dying over here. My son has autism and when he gets overwhelmed, he needs to let it out somewhere safe. Our backyard is private. I don't care what he has. She cut me off hard. This affects everyone and my daughter is having nightmares about it. Then tell her some kids express themselves differently. I'm not explaining your problems to my child. She shot back. That's not my job as a parent. Her husband appeared behind her. We've tried to be understanding, but this can't continue like this. You've never said anything to us before. He held up his phone. I've been recording everything and sending it to the HOA for two months. Now we have documentation. You're recording my son for evidence. He said it flatly. This isn't normal behavior and you know it. My son came to the door holding his tablet. He looked scared from all the yelling. The neighbor stepped backward fast. See, even the way he moves is disturbing. Something's not right here. He started humming quietly. That's what he does when he's anxious. She pointed right at him. That sound Right there. Hours of that every single day through our fence. I can hear it in my kitchen. He's 10 years old. He's not hurting anyone. My voice was getting tight. Her face turned bright red. My daughter can't sleep at night because she thinks your house is haunted, she told her entire class at school. I had to go in and talk to the teacher, maybe explain that people are different instead of making him sound like a monster. She nearly yelled. I shouldn't have to teach my kid about your family's issues. That's on you. My wife pushed past me into the doorway. Our son exists and that's not negotiable. You need to leave our property. The neighbor pulled out more papers from her pocket. I spoke to a lawyer about noise ordinances and disturbance laws. We have grounds here. You're threatening to sue us because our kid plays in his own yard. If you can't control him, maybe you should consider moving somewhere more appropriate for your situation. She said it like she'd been planning that line. My son's humming got louder and he started rocking side to side. She pointed again with this triumphant look. This is exactly what I mean. This is what we deal with constantly. Our other neighbor jogged over from across the street. Everything okay? I heard shouting from inside my house. The woman spun toward her. Perfect timing. Maybe you can help us explain the constant.

The family started cheering. The cast member looked at us with this apologetic face. I'm so sorry. We're completely sold out. My sister made this sound I've never heard from a human before. My mom got in the cast member's face. No, absolutely not. Check the back. There has to be more. The cast member kept apologizing and my sister started crying. The family in front of us was walking away with their kid holding the bucket above his head. My sister took off running and my mom went right after her. My sister tried to grab the bucket from the kid's hands. The dad pulled his son away and my sister was screaming, you don't even care about figment. You're just gonna throw that away in a week. My mom shoved the dad so hard he stumbled backwards. Then she lunged at the kid and grabbed the bucket. Kid started wailing. The other mom tried to grab it back and my mom yanked it away so hard the handle broke. My sister dropped to her knees sobbing, no, you broke it. Then she looked up at me with your hatred. This is all your fault. If you had run when I told you to, we would have been ahead of them. Disney security showed up and escorted us past hundreds of people who were recording and staring. My sister was crying so hard she could barely Walk and my mom was arguing with security the entire time. We got taken to some office where a supervisor explained that we were banned from all Disney properties. Mom tried to argue that my sister has a medical condition. My daughter needs this popcorn bucket for her mental health. My dad was sitting in the corner with his head in his hands. My sister was on her phone looking up resale prices for the bucket and crying harder every time she refreshed. The supervisor said we needed to leave immediately and that if we tried to come back, we'd be arrested for trespassing. They walked us out through a back exit. We had dinner reservations that night that cost $400 and we missed it because we spent three hours getting banned from Disney World. We drove back to the hotel in complete silence except for my sister sobbing in the back seat. My mom kept saying that family is going to sell that bucket for hundreds of dollars. That's why they wanted it so badly. I checked my phone and my sister had posted a five paragraph rant about Disney discriminating against adults and how I ruined her life by not caring about her passion. My mom had already commented, so proud of you for standing up for yourself, baby girl.

My sister has been obsessed with Disney since we were kids, but it got really bad after college. She's 24 now and has an annual pass even though we live in Ohio, which means my parents fund her monthly trips to Florida. Her room looks like a Disney store exploded in it. She has hundreds of collector pins covering every surface and a shrine to figment the Dragon in the corner. She even tracks limited edition merchandise on a spreadsheet. My parents pay for everything because she claimed she was building a business selling Disney content, but her Instagram only had 200 followers. I wanted nothing to do with this weird Disney worship, but my mom somehow guilt tripped me into going on a family trip with them. The trip was a nightmare from day one. My sister had a full itinerary planned down to the minute, including which bathrooms we were allowed to use. She cried twice before lunch on the first day because the character meet and greet line was too long. My parents just kept apologizing to her and buying her stuff to calm her down. By day three, I was looking at flights home. That's when my sister burst into my room at 6:00am. The segment bucket drops tomorrow, she said like she was announcing someone died. She made us sit through a 45 minute Presentation about how we were going to obtain the bucket. My mom was taking notes and my dad asked if we needed walkie talkies. When I said it's just a popcorn bucket, my sister's face went red. You don't get me. You never have. My mom squeezed my arm. Please just support her. The next morning, we got to Eckhart two hours before it opened. When the gates opened, everyone started power walking toward the store. My sister was practically running and my parents were right behind her. I was walking at a normal pace because I don't run for anyone. When we got in line at the store, it was already wrapped around the building. My sister was on her phone refreshing five different Disney Facebook groups and doing breathing exercises. My mom was next to her saying, you're doing so good, baby. We're almost there. When we finally got close to the front, a cast member came out and started counting heads. She pointed at the family.

They acted like I was the villain for not giving up something I paid for. They tried to guilt trip me by sticking their kid in my seat before I even got there, hoping I'd just go along with it. That's manipulative. If sitting together was so important, book your seats in advance like everyone else. Don't show up expecting strangers to fix your problem and then act like they're terrible people when they say, no, I didn't ask why they needed To sit together. I didn't care. Maybe the kid gets scared flying. Maybe the dad's controlling. Maybe they just didn't feel like paying extra to pick seats. None of that is my problem. The dad tried to shame me in front of a plane full of people. And when that didn't work, he got passive aggressive and his wife just sat there watching him act like a child. The irony.

So I made sure they turned into laughing stocks. The day I met Brian's mother, Rita, she looked me up and down and said I seem nice for a temporary girlfriend. That should have been my warning. Brian and I met at a veterinary conference in Denver. He was presenting on equine surgery. I was there for my small animal practice. We bonded over terrible conference coffee and our shared obsession with emergency medicine. Six months later, he proposed at the same conference, right where we'd first met. His family's reaction was immediate and vicious. Rita called Brian crying, saying he was throwing his life away. His father Richard, sent a formal email listing all the women from their country club who would have been better choices. His sister Sophia started a group chat with the extended family called Brian's Mistake, where they shared articles about divorce rates. I didn't know Brian had seen it when he borrowed Sophia's phone. For two years, I tried everything. I brought Rita her favorite flowers on every visit. I helped Richard with his classic car restoration research. I attended Sophia's Boring Charity luncheons for her friends whispered about me being a gold digger even though I made more money than Brian. Nothing worked. They wanted their son to marry Victoria, the daughter of their best friends, who'd been waiting for Brian to notice her. Since high school. Victoria, who still called him twice a week. Victoria, whose parents owned half the commercial real estate in town. I stopped trying after Rita's Thanksgiving incident. She'd invited Victoria to dinner without telling us, seated her next to Brian, and spent the entire meal talking about their shared memories while I sat there like furniture. Brian finally told them that if they couldn't respect me, they wouldn't be part of our lives. They backed off, but only superficially. The wedding planning revealed their true strategy. Rita insisted on being involved, then criticized every choice. The venue was too rustic, the flowers were too simple, the caterer wasn't prestigious enough. She offered to pay for upgrades, but only if she could make the decisions. Declined, and paid for everything ourselves. Three days before the wedding, Sophia called Brian, panicking. She'd seen our cousin posting about her dress and realized she bought the same one I described as similar to mine. Could she still

She agreed, sounded apologetic even. The morning of our wedding, I was getting ready with my bridesmaids when the photographer knocked. He needed to discuss something urgent. Brian's family had arrived for pre ceremony photos and there was a situation. Every single one of them was wearing white. Rita was in a white beaded gown that looked like a mother of the bride dress because it was one. Richard is in a white suit. Sophia is in a white cocktail dress. Brian's grandmother, aunts, uncles and cousins all in white. 23 people dressed like they were attending their own weddings. The photographer didn't know what to do. My maid of honor, Julia started cursing. My mother went silent, which was worse than yelling. I asked the photographer to give us a moment and sat down. To think they wanted to ruin my wedding. They wanted the photos to look ridiculous. Everyone to talk about how his family upstaged me for the day to be about their protest instead of our marriage. But then I remembered something. Julia's sister managed a Halloween store that stayed open year round for theater productions. It was 40 minutes away. I called her. Did she have costume accessories in bulk? Specifically, did she have those cheap promotional t shirts from last Halloween's zombie run, the bright red ones with fake blood spatters that said survivor in huge letters? She had boxes of them. Julia and two bridesmaids. Drove there while I continued getting ready. They came back with 30 shirts and a bag of accessories. I had the wedding coordinator call a quick meeting with Brian's family in the garden, away from other guests. I walked out in my wedding dress carrying the box of shirts. Rita started to speak, probably to make some excuse, but I cut her off. You have two choices, I said. Put these on over your clothes right now or leave. The ceremony starts in 20 minutes. Sophia laughed, said I was being ridiculous, that I couldn't force them to ruin their outfits. Richard said I had no right to make demands. Rita called me a controlling bitch who'd finally shown my true colours. That's when Brian appeared. He'd been waiting inside, letting me handle it my way. First. He looked at his family, all dressed in white, and said five words, put them on or go. Their jaws dropped. Full story on channel link below.

Our daughter's mouth snapped shut, but her eyes were still blazing with anger. Sit down, my husband said quietly, and listen to me. She sat, arms crossed, glaring at him. You wanna talk about privilege, he said, pulling out his phone. Let me show you something I don't want to, she started. No, you're going to watch this and you're going to think about what real homophobia looks like. He pulled up a video. The first one showed gay people in the Middle East talking about living and hiding, about the constant fear. Then another from Eastern Europe where a pride parade got attacked. Then footage I couldn't even watch all the way through showing what happens to LGBTQ people in countries where it's illegal. Our daughter's face changed. The anger drained away, replaced by something else for maybe or shame. That's real homophobia, my husband said. That's what actual discrimination looks like. You live in a country where you can dye your hair rainbow and wear ride shirts and call your parents bigots over dinner. Do you understand how incredibly lucky you are? Dad, I am not finished. His voice was shaking now. We love you. We have loved you since the day you were born and we will Love you until the day we die. We have spent months learning how to support you better. We read books. We went to groups. We changed the way we talk and think because we want you to feel safe and loved. Tears were rolling down his cheeks now. But you don't get to weaponize your sexuality. You don't get to scream homophobia every time someone disagrees with you. There are gay kids your age who are being thrown out of their homes, beaten, killed, and you're calling us bigots be cause we won't dye our hair. Our daughter was crying now, too. I just wanted you to show that you care. We do care, I said. But showing we care doesn't mean doing everything you demand. That's not how love works. She, he stood up from the table without another word and went upstairs. We heard her door closed. That was 3 hours ago. The house has been completely silent since then. I can see light under her door, but she hasn't come out. My husband is sitting on the couch staring at nothing. I think we both feel like we failed somehow.

So I gave her a tough reality check. She came out at 15, and we were nothing but supportive. My husband cried happy tears, told her we loved her no matter what. I immediately ordered books on supporting LGBTQ teens. We researched everything, joined parent support group, Learned the terminology. We thought we were doing everything right. But over the past few months, something shifted. Every single conversation became about her sexuality. Every disagreement became ammunition. I asked her to clean her room. You're only saying that because as I'm gay. My husband said she couldn't go to a party. This is homophobia. At first, we thought maybe this was normal, part of her finding her identity. The support group said to be patient, but kept escalating. She started policing our language, our friends, even what we watched on TV. If we didn't immediately agree with every opinion she had, suddenly we were anti gay. The worst part? We couldn't even talk about it. Anytime we tried to have a conversation, she'd shut down or start crying about how we didn't support her. My husband and I felt like we were walking on eggshells in our own house. Last night, everything came to a head. We were having dinner, just normal Wednesday night pasta, when she brought up Pride Month. She dyed her hair rainbow the week before, and honestly, it looked great. We told her That we'd already promised to go to the raid with her in a few weeks, but apparently that wasn't enough. I think it's disgusting when straight people don't show visible support during pride, she said, twirling her pasta. It's basically the same as racism. If you're not actively showing you're an ally, you're part of the problem. My husband and I exchanged a look. Here we go again. Honey, we are allies, I said carefully. We support you completely. Then prove it, she said. I want all of us to dye our hair for Pride Month. Any rainbow color. It doesn't matter which one. I tried to stay calm. Sweetheart, we're not going to do that. We support, but we don't need to dye our hair to prove it. Her face went red. Are you serious right now? This is exactly what I'm talking about. You say you support me, but when it comes to actually doing something, you won't. Dying our hair isn't. I started. You're homophobic! She yelled. Both of you! You don't actually support me, you just pretend to.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from Accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. A crowd formed to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. Crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space, someone yelled. Laughter erupted. The CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was ex.

So my whole family had been using my Amazon Prime account for like three years. My mom, my sister Ashley, my Uncle Rick. Even my grandma somehow figured out how to order stuff. I was paying for it because I actually use Amazon all the time for work stuff and groceries, but they were just leeching off it. The breaking point happened two weeks ago. I check my account and see 17 packages coming to different addresses. 17! My sister ordered a whole workout set she'll never use. My mom got some fancy face cream that cost 60 bucks, and my Uncle Rick ordered a drone he definitely doesn't need. But the worst part was my cousin Blake ordered a gaming chair that cost $400. I called Blake and asked him what the hell he was thinking. He just laughed and said it's not his problem. I gave everyone access. He said if I didn't want people using it, I shouldn't have shared the password. This kid just graduated high school and acts like he runs the world. So I called my mum and told her everyone needed to chip in for prime or get their own accounts. She got all dramatic and said family should help each other out. She reminded me how she used to buy me clothes when I was younger. I told her that was literally her job as a parent and not the same thing at all. Then Ashley calls me crying, saying she can't afford her own prime account because she's saving for a wedding. I reminded her that her wedding is in two years and she just spent $300 on workout clothes she returned last month. She said I was being petty and that it's only like $10 a month split between everyone. I did the math. If everyone chipped in 10 bucks, that would actually cover prime and give me extra money. But when I suggested this in our family group chat, suddenly everyone had excuses. My mom said she's on a fixed income. Ashley said she's saving for the wedding. Rick said he barely uses it anyway, which is a lie because he ordered protein powder just yesterday. The final straw was when my grandma called me, confused about why her soap order got cancelled. Turns out my account got flagged for fishes activity. Because there were so many different addresses, Amazon temporarily locked my account and I couldn't order my medication refills. That's when I snapped. I changed the password and removed everyone's.

In our senior year, Marcus had always been the guy who made school bearable. The one who'd impersonate teachers perfectly or release three chickens numbered 1, 2 and 4 into the hallways, leaving staff searching for non existent chicken No. 3 for hours. His pranks were creative but never truly harmful until graduation day. For weeks, he'd been mysteriously absent. During lunch periods, we noticed him hanging around the auditorium where graduation would be held, but assumed he was just helping set up like other student during the ceremony. Everything seemed normal until our principal approached the podium to deliver his traditional speech. When you press the microphone button instead of turning on, the entire electrical system shut down. In the confusion that followed, the giant projection screen behind the stage suddenly lit up, apparently connected to some separate power source. What appeared was a compilation video of secretly recorded faculty meetings where teachers made sarcastic comments about students, gust grade, manipulations for athletes and our principal referred to our class as the worst batch in years. The footage was devastating. Miss Wilson mocking a student's learning disability. Coach Brenner admitting to changing grade. It's Doctor Harrison calling parents entitled whiners. Parents gasped. Students looked stunned. The teachers on stage froze in horror. Within seconds, parents began shouting. Several students in the audience burst into tears seeing their teachers true opinions of them. The superintendent tried desperately to shut down the Projection. But Marcus.

I was 22, living my best life when my phone exploded with calls from my entire family. My cousin Eve, who was 16, told everyone I'd been sneaking into her room and that she was now pregnant with my baby. The whole family believed her instantly. My parents screamed at me over the phone, calling me disgusting. My siblings blocked me on everything. Even my grandparents who raised me wouldn't take my calls. I had zero proof it wasn't true. Eve was the family princess and I was just a black sheep cousin who barely came around anymore. The accusations spread like wildfire through our tight knit extended family. Aunts and uncles who used to invite me to barbecues suddenly acted like I didn't exist. Mom's sister, Eve's mother posted critical Facebook statuses about protecting our children from predators in our own family. Within a week, I was completely erased from every family group chat, every holiday plan, every graduation announcement. The next year destroyed me completely. I waited every day for police to show up at my door with handcuffs. Every knock made my heart stop. Every phone call from an unknown number sent me into a panic attack. I lost my job at the auto shop because I couldn't focus, kept making mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss finally sat me down and said, whatever was going on? At home, needed to stay there, but I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment three months later when I couldn't make rent, moved in with a buddy who let me crash on his couch. But even he started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Started drinking heavily just to sleep. Then drinking to get through the day. Then drinking because breathing felt impossible without it. Dating became a nightmare. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried to date asked to meet my parents. After 2 months, I made up some story about them being dead. Second girl saw through the lies when she noticed I I had zero family photos, no childhood stories, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. And when I couldn't give a straight answer, he was gone by morning. The isolation was crushing. Holidays were the worst. Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call. I'd drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway knowing they were all inside without me. I finally moved three states away and started completely over. New job, new friends, new identity. Told everyone I met that my family lived far away and we weren't close. Simple, clean lie that people accepted. Got into therapy, got sober, worked my ass off to build something resembling a normal life.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together, I've been playing husband since year 2, paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down, tears in her eyes, hand on her heart, then some perfectly rehearsed excuse, we're not ready. Let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5, and she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time, convinced myself maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it when she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew, and she didn't even let me finish the speech, just shook her head with this pitying smile like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke, asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant and the mask came. Completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said. Voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place. After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place. Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. She didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working, she texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic started. Creep. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night acting extra sweet. Made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said. Kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

We'll make your sister pay. She'll never say no to family. I froze with the grocery bags in my hands. Through the kitchen window, I could see them all sitting around the table. Mom, dad, and my brother. Landon Harper's got that new job, dad was saying. Making good money now. We'll just tell her it's for mom's surgery. Mom nodded. She gave us 12,000 for the roof last year, no questions asked. My stomach dropped. There was no roof repair. I'd seen the receipts myself. They'd used my money for Landon's gambling debts. How much this time? Mom asked. 50,000, Landon said casually, maybe 60 if we play it right. Tell her the cancer came back. Cancer? They were going to fake cancer to steal from me. I backed away slowly, my mind racing. The cancer scare from two years ago, the one that made me liquidate my retirement fund to pay for experimental treatments. Had that been fake, too? I thought about all the times I'd help. The car accident that wasn't covered by insurance. Landon's business that needed start up capital. Mom's dental work, Dad's back surgery. $57,000 over five years. All because I thought I was being a good daughter. Every family gathering, they praise me for being so generous. Behind my back, they were laughing at how easy I was to manipulate. I got In my car and drove straight to the bank. I'd like to close all my accounts, I told the teller. All of them. Miss. Every single one. And I need cashier's checks for the full amount. Plus documentation of every transaction I've made to these three people over the past five years. That evening, Landon called, right on schedule. Hey, sis, can you come over tomorrow? Mom has some news about her health. His voice had that practiced concern, the same tone he'd used for every fake emergency. Sure, I said sweetly. I'll bring the whole family something special.

The landlord started laughing. My roommate's boyfriend, Wesley, had been planning this moment for months, ever since he started staying over back in June. He'd been telling his boys about how he was finessing his way into a free apartment. He even started forwarding his mail here to establish what he called residency rights. The relationship wasn't even official before Wesley started making his move. He'd walk around my apartment, well, what he thought was going to be his apartment, measuring room and telling his cousin which wall would be perfect for his TV setup. Melanie's been carrying this dead weight for too long, he'd mutter while eating my groceries. Time for her to learn she doesn't need a roommate anymore. So there I was, standing in my own living room on a Thursday night. The whole place smelled like the Cologne Wesley bathed in. Wesley showed up with his cousin Mitchell and two duffel bags, already acting like he owned the place, both of them looking like they were ready to physically move me out if needed. Melanie, I hope you found somewhere else to stay, Wesley said, dropping his bags by the door. This is happening tonight. You've been taking advantage of my girl's kindness for long enough. I stayed quiet, scrolling through my phone, let him have his moment. Melanie sat on the couch, avoiding eye contact with everyone. Wesley had been working on her for weeks. Convincing her that I was holding her back, that they needed their privacy, that couples shouldn't have roommates. She'd started parroting his words recently. Maybe it's time for a change. Maybe we've outgrown this arrangement. Classic Wesley manipulation. The man didn't even have his own place. He'd been couch surfing before he latched onto Melanie. Wesley pulled out a crump

Noah was diagnosed with autism when he was 3. He's 7 now, brilliant with numbers, loves trains more than anything and gives the best hugs when he's comfortable with you. My mother never got comfortable. From the diagnosis day, she acted like Noah had something contagious. She'd visit my sister Rebecca every weekend, babysit her twins, Tyler and Madison whenever needed, take them shopping, to movies, to restaurants. Noah got 10 minute visits where she'd stand by the door checking her watch. Rebecca's kids called her Nana. Noah called her Missus Dorothy because she never corrected him to use anything warmer. I tried explaining autism to her so many times. He's not broken, mom. His brain just works differently. She'd nod and change the subject. When family gatherings happened, she'd set up activities for Tyler and Madison, but nothing Noah could participate in. They play charades while Noah sat alone with his tablet. She'd bring special treats for the twins. But forget Noah couldn't eat certain textures. Every birthday, Tyler and Madison got elaborate parties at her house. Noah's birthday got a card with a twenty dollar Bill. The favoritism was obvious, but I kept hoping she'd come around. Then came Christmas last year. We all gathered at Mom's house like always. Tyler and Madison, now 10, raced to the tree where identical wrapped boxes waited. Tore them open. To find the latest ipads, complete with expensive cases and prepaid App Store cards, $500 each easily. Noah watched from the corner, flapping his hands with excitement. He loved unwrapping presents. The paper crinkling was one of his favorite sounds. Mom handed him a small, poorly wrapped gift. Inside was a half used coloring book with pages already colored in, clearance sticker still attached showing 99 cents, not even new, used from a dollar store. Noah didn't understand the insult. He just saw a gift and hugged it saying, thank you, missus Dorothy in her sweet voice. But Tyler understood. Madison understood. They exchanged looks that said even they knew this was wrong. Rebecca stayed silent. My wife Laura gripped my hand so hard it hurt. Mom smiled like she'd done something generous. At least it's something he can actually use, she said, you know, with his limitations. That's when I stood up. Noah, Buddy, go to the car with Mommy. We're leaving.

My daughter Amy lost her first baby two years ago. He was still born at 38 weeks. They were gonna name him Philip. When she came home from the hospital, she couldn't even look at the nursery. She asked us to take it all down before she got back. Every single thing, the crib, the changing table, the little elephant mobile we'd hung together. She kept his ultrasound pictures and a tiny lock of his hair in a memory box. Everything else had to go. My husband's sister, Vanessa, had given Amy this expensive stroller at the baby shower. When we started donating things, Vanessa lost her mind. She called Amy hysterical. She told everyone at Sunday dinner that taking down a nursery was ridiculous and dramatic. She said Amy needed to grow up and face reality. I had to physically stand between them at one point because Amy was shaking so hard she could barely breathe. We banned Vanessa from family stuff for six months. She only came back after promising she'd never mention Philip again. Fast forward to last month, Amy's pregnant again, 26 weeks with a girl. We threw her a baby shower at my house. I invited Vanessa because my husband begged me to keep the peace. Big mistake. The whole afternoon, Vanessa whispered to people. I heard her tell my neighbor we were tacky for throwing a second baby shower. She Told my husband's cousin that Amy was milking the tragedy for attention and free stuff. I watched her roll her eyes every time someone congratulated Amy, but she stayed away from my daughter, so I bit my tongue. Then Amy started opening presents. There were these tiny pink onesies with bunnies on them.

I watched her roll her eyes every time someone congratulated Amy. But she stayed away from my daughter, so I bit my tongue. Then Amy started opening presents. There were these tiny pink onesies with bunnies on them. A handmade blanket from her best friend, Amy. He was smiling for the first time in months, really smiling. And I felt like I could finally breathe. That's when Vanessa spoke up, loud enough for everyone to hear. You know, if you hadn't torn apart Philip's nursery and thrown everything away like it meant nothing, you wouldn't be sitting here begging people for gifts. The room went silent. Amy's hands stopped moving. She just stared at the wall with this blank look on her face. And then tears started rolling down her cheeks. She didn't make a sound. Just tears. I grabbed Vanessa's gift from the pile, walked to the front door, and threw it onto the driveway. The box split open, and some glass thing inside shattered on the concrete. Get out! I said, right now. Vanessa crossed her arms. I'm not leaving. I have every right to be here. Someone needs to tell the truth. I completely lost it. Get out of my house! Screamed it so loud, my throat hurt. My husband ran in from the garage, where he'd been helping his dad load chairs into the car. His mom explained what happened, and without saying a word, he picked up Vanessa like she weighed nothing and carried her out the door. She was yelling the whole time about how we were all enabling Amy's weakness. He set her down on the porch and said, don't come back. Amy left the shower early. She didn't even take the gifts. Just grabbed her purse and walked out to her car while people were still standing around in shock.

My dad died when my mom was 8 months pregnant with me. She already had my brother, who's basically our dad's clone. Same face, same walk, even the same laugh, apparently. And my mom, she's been living through him ever since. Like when I graduated valedictorian, she left halfway through my speech because my brother texted he needed a ride from his buddies house. When I got engaged, she spent the entire entire dinner showing my fiance photos of my brother's high school football highlights from 10 years ago. But I'm the idiot who keeps trying. So I invite her to my gender reveal party, thinking maybe, just maybe, she'll actually show up for me this time. My husband thinks I'm setting myself up for disappointment, but I tell him this is different. This is about her grandchild. She has to care about that. The party is actually going amazing at first. We've got 60 people here, custom decorations, and these insane fireworks my husband special ordered that'll explode in either pink or blue. Then my mom plants herself right in front of the reveal area where we're supposed to light the fireworks. We're waiting for your brother. She announces to everyone he's family and deserves to be here. I tell her we're starting at three PM as planned. She doesn't move. These things can wait. People are starting to stare, pulling Out their phones, whispering. My mother in law steps forward, saying we should stick to schedule. My mom gets louder. What kind of person excludes her own brother from such an important moment? The entire party goes silent. Kids are asking their parents what's happening. I try to walk around her, but she literally grabs my arm. Your brother is 15 minutes away. We're waiting. My cousin starts defending me, saying this is my party, my choice. Other relatives jump in, defending my mom, saying family is family. It's turning into this whole scene with everyone taking sides. My husband finally says enough and goes to get the fireworks himself so we can just do this. He comes back. Haley! The entire box is gone. Vanished. I'm searching everywhere, my dress getting dirty from checking behind bushes, under tables. Guests are grabbing their stuff, saying they have other commitments and can't wait around. My mom sitting there calmly sipping wine. Maybe this is a sign. We should wait for your brother. He's so close now. My best friend whispers that she thinks my mom

Others are nodding, but we can't prove anything. Suddenly, there's this massive boom from behind the house, then crackles filling the air. Pop, pop, pop. Echoing through the neighborhood. My husband and I sprint outside and the sky is exploding in bright blue fireworks, blue spirals shooting higher than the trees. Someone is setting off our gender reveal. We're having a boy. But the fireworks are coming from the empty lot behind our house. Everyone scream. I'm in confusion. Half the people missed it because they were inside. Others are recording on their phones trying to catch the tail end. My aunt's freaking that this wasn't the plan. Some guests look excited, others furious. I'm standing there crying because, yes, I'm having a son, but also because someone just stole this moment. Then through the smoke, I see a figure stumbling around in the empty lot. It's my brother, beer in hand, laughing like this is the funniest thing ever. He's shouting something at my mom, but I can't make out the words. My mom's face has this weird expression, not surprised exactly, but something else, proud. But why would she do this? My mom starts making the speech about how surprises make the best memories, while my brother stumbles over, reeking of beer and gunpowder. He's grinning at her like a kid who just won a prize. Did I do good, mom? You said the empty lot would be perfect. Everyone freezes. My mom tries to recover. Saying she thought it would be special if my brother participated as a surprise. But people aren't buying it. You deliberately ruined your daughter's gender reveal, my friend says. My mom gets defensive, says I'm always excluding my brother from important moments that siblings should share, milestones. My husband tells them both to leave immediately. As my mom's gathering her purse, she starts crying about how my dad would have wanted his son included, how my brother deserves to be part of every family Celebration. She actually says, your father loved your brother so much, he would understand why I did this. That's when I lose it completely because last month I found my dad's journal while cleaning out the attic. He'd written an entry the day before he died talking about the baby girl he couldn't wait to meet. He wrote, I hope she knows she was wanted, planned for, already loved. He'd even picked out my name. So, no, mom, I don't think dad would understand at all.

Her dad flew back screaming, you fired who? Our lead investor called an emergency meeting. He just pointed to my name on their funding documents. He looked at the board and asked quietly, so do you want to pay the 45 million dollar fine or just hand over the company? So this happened three weeks ago and I'm still processing it. I've been with Tech Core Systems for 14 years. Started as a junior analyst, worked my way up to senior operations director. I literally helped build this company from 20 employees in a cramped office to over 500 people across three states. The founder, Richard Palmer was an amazing boss, smart, fair, actually listen to people. But last year he decided to semi retire and handed the CEO position to his daughter Madison. She was 26, fresh out of business school and had exactly zero experience running anything except her Instagram account. First thing Madison did, hired her college friends. Her new c 0 0 was this guy named Brett who wore designer suits and called everyone chief. Within months, the culture went from collaborative to toxic. But I kept my head down and did my job. Then last Tuesday, Madison called me into the office. Brett was there with two interns all smirking like they knew something I didn't. Madison didn't even look up from her phone. Jessica, we're streamlining, cutting legacy costs. You've been here since like the Dinosaur. Age, right. She slid a folder across the desk. Here's your Severance. Security will escort you out in 10 minutes. I just stood there calm because here's what Madison didn't know. 12 years ago when we raised our Series B funding, I was in those negotiations. Lead investor Horizon Capital wanted Protection clauses. Their lawyer and I spent weeks drafting an agreement that protected both sides. One clause specifically named me as essential operational personnel. It meant if I was terminated without cause, the investor could trigger penalty clauses. I never told anyone because it seemed like overkill at the time. Just lawyers.

And they finally Learned what she left them with. I married my husband when his twins were eight. Their mom had walked out two years earlier, leaving nothing but a note that said she needed to find herself. No calls, no birthday cards, nothing but to hear the kids talk. She was a saint who'd been driven away. Every family dinner was a war zone. I'd cook their favorites and they'd push the plates away. Your meatloaf tastes weird. Real mom made it better. I'd help with homework and get accused of doing it wrong. Real mom was smarter. I bought them new clothes and heard how real mom had better taste. My husband would just sigh and say they needed time to adjust. Time, like three years wasn't enough. The breaking point came on their 11th birthday. I'd spent weeks planning, decorating the house, baking a cake from scratch, inviting all their friends. When they walked in and saw the decorations, my stepdaughter started crying, you ruined it. Real mom always took us to that fancy restaurant. You're trying too hard to be her and you'll never be. I looked at my husband. He wouldn't meet my eyes. The party went on, forced smiles and whispered complaints. That night, after everyone left, I made a decision. If I'd never be their real mom, I'd stop pretending to be any kind of mom at all. The Next morning, I moved my things to the guest room. I stopped cooking family dinners and made meals for just myself. They could fend for themselves or their dad could handle it. I stopped doing their laundry, stopped helping with homework, stopped driving them to activities. I stopped buying them things. I became a polite roommate in my own house. My husband was furious. You're acting like a child. They're kids. They don't know better. But I was done. Your kids made it clear I'm not their mother, so I'm not going to act like one. You wanted a wife. You got one. You wanted a mom for your kids. You should have married someone they'd actually accept. The first week, they barely noticed. By week 2, the complaint started. There's no food in the house. Why isn't my uniform clean? I need a ride to soccer practice. I'd smile politely. Ask your dad or maybe call your real mom since she's so wonderful. Week 3, my stepdaughter's big school project was due. She'd always left things to the last minute because I'd swoop in and help. Not anymore. She failed and came home crying. My husband tried to blame me. You could have reminded her, I shrugged. Real mom would have remembered. Then came the phone call that changed everything. It was a Thursday evening, one month into my strike. The doorbell rang and my husband answered. I heard raised voices, shocked gasps. A woman's voice I didn't recognize. But the kids did. They came running down the stairs screaming, Mom, mom, you came back. I walked into the living room and saw her, their real mom, standing in the doorway with a designer purse.

So I made sure her next family reunion exposed everything. I was 23 when the endometriosis diagnosis came. Three surgeries later, biological children weren't in my future. I told my dad and tried to move on. At Thanksgiving, my stepmom decided it was everyone's business. My. My cousin announced her pregnancy. My stepmom raised her wine glass and said, loud enough for all 17 relatives to hear, well, at least some of us can carry on the family name properly. She looked directly at me. It's such a shame when someone can't contribute to the family legacy. Makes you wonder if they're really part of the family at all. My dad just stared at his plate. He'd married her three years ago after my mom died. That became her weapon. At every gathering, she'd mention it. Oh, we're talking about grandchildren. Well, some of us won't be providing any. My dad gave apologetic looks, but never said a word. Christmas, she announced she was pregnant at 39. She spent the evening rubbing her belly and talking about real blood family and continuing the pure family line. That's when I started digging. I found her ex husband on Facebook. We talked for three hours. She'd cleaned out their joint accounts while he visited his dying mother, filed a restraining order based on fabricated abuse claims, took the house. He'd lost everything, including custody of his daughter, because she Convinced the judge he was dangerous. He had evidence. Bank statements, text messages, affidavits from neighbors who'd witnessed her screaming at him. I kept digging. Three previous marriages, same pattern. Then I found her daughter, the one she'd given up at 19 and never mentioned. I found her through adoption registries. She was 20 now and had been searching for years. I verified everything three times. Then I planned. Family reunion was in July at my uncle's lakehouse. My stepmom spent weeks planning it, determined to show off her pregnancy. I R S V P ed for two. She was holding court by the pool, one hand on her belly, surrounded by relatives. My dad stood beside her. I walked up with my guest. The crowd parted. My stepmom's face went white. This is my sister, I announced loudly. Her daughter from her first pregnancy, the one she's never mentioned. Her daughter turned to our stepmom. I've been looking for you for three years. I just wanted to know why you gave me up. My stepmom stammered. That's not. I don't. You must be mistaken. I pulled out my folder and started passing around documents. Bank statements from her second marriage showing theft. Police reports from her third marriage proving her abuse allegations were dismissed. Text messages where she told her friend she was only in it for the money. And medical records showing she'd had her tubes tied four years ago. The pregnancy was a lie. The bump was Padding.

When I arrived, I discovered she told everyone I was the paid help and couldn't eat with guests. Gemma and I had been friends since college. When she asked me to photograph her wedding for free, I initially quoted my standard rate of $4,000, but she gasped and said, I thought we were best friends. Real friends don't charge each other. She then started crying about wedding stress and budget problems, promising I'd be her guest of honour, sitting at the head table celebrating as her best friend who just happened to a camera. Against my better judgment, I agreed to photograph her wedding. The morning of the wedding, when the catering manager tried directing me to the kitchen, I marched straight to Gemma in her bridal suite. What the hell is this about me eating in the kitchen? I demanded. She barely looked up from her phone, saying, well, you are working, aren't you? It would look weird if the photographer was eating with guests. I reminded her of our agreement and she rolled her eyes. God, don't be so dramatic. Just do this one thing for me on my day. I stormed out of the bridal suite, but Gemma's mother immediately intercepted me in the hallway, pressing a vendor meal ticket into my hand. The kitchen staff will call you when it's time to eat. I handed it back firmly. I'm Gemma's Best friend and a guest. There's been a misunderstanding. Her mother's face went hold. Gemma specifically told me, you're the hired help. Don't make a scene at my daughter's wedding. During the ceremony, as I photographed from the aisle, Gemma's cousin leaned over and asked loudly, are you the budget photographer Gemma found on Craigslist? Before Gemma could respond from the altar, I announced, actually, I'm the professional photographer doing this as a wedding gift that would normally cost four grand. Gemma's face flushed red and her smile froze. Between the ceremony and reception, while photographing the wedding party, I overheard Gemma telling her bridesmaids she charged her parents $3,000 for photography, pocketing the money since she got me to work for free. So what? She snapped when I confronted her. You can afford it with all your fancy clients. Her maid of honour laughed about Gemma selling today's prince workers for $75 each as exclusive professional photography. I'm watermarking everything with my business logo and rates, I declared. Gemma grabbed my arm hard enough to leave marks. You will not ruin this for me. At cocktail hour, Marvin the groom, cornered me. He was drunk and tried sliding his hand down my back. Gemma told me about your desperate financial situation, he said, trying to imply something disgusting. I snapped loudly, get your hands off me, Marvin, or I'll tell everyone about Vegas! Gemma saw

I responded, understood. Two days later, their lawyer reached out to me in a panic. I've been the family's financial backbone for nearly 4 years. I paid their 1,800 dollar monthly mortgage like clockwork, plus utilities, insurance, emergency repairs, everything. My name, my credit, my money. They never said thank you. My sister Marissa was always in crisis. Credit card maxed out. I paid it. Car repairs, I covered it. Daycare costs, I sent cash until she figured it out. Three years later, she was still figuring it out. I never said no because I thought this was what family did until I Learned it was exactly what they expected. The first crack appeared while scrolling Facebook. There was Marissa, my parents and the kids in front of the house I was paying for, holding a Home Sweet Home sign. The caption, so proud of our daughter for building a future we can all share. This home is in the right hands. No acknowledgement of me, no tag, no gratitude, just them smiling on a porch I had paid for. Days later, I called the bank. Mortgage was still in my name, but there was a request to change the primary contact to Miss Marissa Harper. Then I found $2,400 missing from my account, transferred to Marissa's emergency card. When confronted, she said, don't make this a thing, Jordan. We needed groceries. I assumed we were still sharing that card. My Mother's response, Marissa is going through a lot. Let's not fight over a few dollars. Few dollars for me. Disaster for Marissa when she missed a phone payment. The family group chat became worse. Someone posted a meme of a man handing over his wallet. Big Brother Energy, pay now, ask never. My cousin tag Jordan. Another, can you cover my student loans too, my father? Only if you name your child after him to keep the donor happy. Nobody defended me. But the final blow came while mowing their backyard. The kitchen window was open and I heard my mother and Marissa talking. Marissa laughed. Did you see his face when I told Aunt Karen the house was mine? He didn't even blink like a puppy, just happy to sniff the plate. Mom giggled. Once the paperwork goes through, he won't be able to say anything. Then Marissa delivered the killing blow. Mom, he's not family anymore. He's just a sponsor. I stood there letting those words sink in. Not family as a sponsor. Three weeks later came the invitation for my mother's 60th birthday, 60 guests, full catering, a legacy event. I didn't rsvp, I just prepared. I printed everything, $311,115 and 84 total contributions with dates and bank records. I saved the audio of their conversation and screenshots of the group chat mockery. I arrived 15 minutes late. During the speeches about sacrifice and love, this screen showed the house with built with love, passed down with Purpose, no mention of me. My mother took the microphone. I'm proud of Marissa. She's shown what legacy truly means. This home will stay in the right hands. I stood up and walked to the microphone. Since we're talking about legacy, let's do the.

We went to court, and I won. The judge looked at their claims, looked at my evidence, and dismissed the case in under 20 minutes. He even made a comment about wasting the court's time. I thought that nightmare was finally over. Then last week, John's sister found me on Instagram under a fake account. She sent me a long message saying she just got engaged, but her boyfriend can't afford a ring. She said since I'm not engaged anymore, I should give her John's ring so it can actually be used for a wedding instead of sitting in my jewelry box. When I said no, she lost it. She started messaging me from different numbers, different social media accounts, even had her friends contact me, saying I was selfish and heartless. My phone was on the table during lunch with my friend Sarah when another message popped up. Sarah read it and asked what was going on. I explained everything, and she got quiet. Then she said maybe I should just give the ring to his sister, that it would mean more to someone who's actually getting married. She told our other friends, and now they're all saying the same thing. That I'm being petty, that I should move on and let the family have the ring. I started doubting myself. Maybe they were Right. Maybe I was holding onto something I didn't need anymore. But then yesterday, I found out the truth. One of John's co workers reached out to me. He said he'd heard about the court case and wanted me to know something. John had life insurance through his job policy. Worth $40,000. It went directly to his parents. The funeral cost 18,000. I did some digging. John's parents own a property management company. They have rental houses all over town. His dad drives a BMW. They're not rich, but they're definitely not broke. They were never struggling to pay for the funeral. They lied to me while I was grieving. Took my money, and then tried to take the one thing I had left of John. And now I know why. They really wanted the ring back. They were planning to sell it.

John died three months after proposing. We were supposed to get married in August. Instead, I planned his funeral in March. His parents called me two days after the accident, crying, saying they couldn't afford a proper service. I didn't even think twice. I emptied our wedding account, the one we've been building together for two years. Every penny we'd save for the venue, the catering, the photographer, all of it went to giving John the funeral he deserved. The morning after we buried him, I was still in the black dress from the service when his brother knocked on my door. He didn't ask how I was doing. He just said he needed the ring back. I was confused. I asked him why, and he looked me straight in the eye and said the ring had been in their family for five generations. Pass down from their great, great, great grandparents. He said it belonged to the family, not to me. I told him that was impossible. I was there when John bought it. We went to this jewelry store that makes some pieces inspired by fantasy movies. John picked out the design, paid for it with his credit card, and proposed that same night. The ring was two sizes too big, so we went back the next week and exchanged it for the right size. I still had the receipt. With both transactions, John's signature, everything. His brother's face turned red. He called me a liar and said I must have faked the paperwork. Then he stormed out. Within an hour, my phone wouldn't stop buzzing. John's mom, his dad, add his sister, his aunts. All of them calling and texting, saying I stole a family heirloom. They said I was dishonoring John's memory by keeping something that wasn't mine. I blocked most of them, but. And I got a letter from a lawyer. They were suing me for the ring, and they were demanding I reimburse them for the funeral costs. Because apparently, I had no right to plan it without their permission. I couldn't believe it. I paid for everything. The casket, the flowers, the burial plot, all of it. And now they wanted me to pay them back. I hired a lawyer and showed him everything. The receipt from the jewelry store with the date and John's name. The exchange paperwork showing we swapped sizes, photos I'd taken.

So I ghosted him, filed for divorce, and moved to a different city to protect my babies. I'm 28, married to Mike for six years. He was kind when we met, helped me escape my drug addicted parents. The only problem was his family. Mike came from extreme wealth. His mother and sister Kayla were cruel from day one. At our first dinner, his mother scoffed, if someone like you would know anything about art. His sister showed Mike bikini photos of his ex right in front of me, telling him he could slide into her DMs anytime. For years, they called me a gold digger, mocked my appearance, and made fun of my poor background. When Mike stopped talking to Kayla after she ruined my birthday, she sent me death threats via text. I eventually stopped attending family events all together. Despite his family, Mike proposed last year. His sister demanded he get a prenup because poor people like you suck money out of anyone. I offered to sign one anyway. I wasn't marrying him for money. Three months ago, I found out I was pregnant with twins. Mike insisted on announcing it at a family gathering. When we did, everyone congratulated us except Kayla and my mother in law, who stared daggers at me. Kayla had been trying to get pregnant for years. But was infertile. Mike's family tried convincing her to adopt, but she refused, saying she didn't want to raise a kid from the streets. When Mike's relatives asked about baby showers, Kayla burst out crying and locked herself in the bathroom. After 30 minutes, she came out and told me I should have talked to her first. My mother in law said I was selfish and made everything about me. Suddenly, Kayla became unusually kind. Both she and my mother in law started calling regularly, sending flowers with cards saying can't wait to see the twins. Kayla even offered to throw my baby shower, which she organized perfectly. The day of the shower, I excused myself to use the bathroom. Coming out, I heard my husband and mother in law arguing in hushed tones in the hallway. My mother in law asked Mike if he'd talked to me yet about their plan with the twins. Mike told her to lower her voice, but she said he needed to man up. Then she said it clearly. He needed to discuss this before the twins were born. Otherwise they wouldn't be able to give one of the twins to Kayla on time for her 27th birthday. She reminded him he'd already agreed, and she's been looking forward to getting a child for months now. They were planning to give away one of my babies as a birthday gift. I stood frozen as they discussed it like it was normal. Mike kept saying He was working on it, and it wasn't an easy conversation. I waited for them to finish.

I did. Days later, her father stormed into her house screaming, do you know what he just did? She didn't even look up from her phone when she said it. Just a casual go ahead, move out, like she was giving me permission to grab coffee. I could see her new guy's name lighting up her screen every few seconds. Sean. Of course, his name was Sean. You've been miserable here anyway, she added, still scrolling. We both know this hasn't been working. I didn't argue, didn't beg, just walked to the bedroom and started packing. Same duffle bag I'd used when I moved in seven years ago, back when her family actually pretended to respect me. She got louder as I folded shirts, talking to herself but making sure I could hear. You'll land on your feet or maybe not. That little laugh at the end, the one that cuts deep better than any insult. When I zip a bag and walked back through the kit Cooper, she looked up with mock surprise. You're actually going, you told me to. My voice was flat. I let the door closed behind me without looking back. What she forgot, what her whole entitled family forgot was that their boutique hotel, the 20 room property her father loves bragging about runs entirely on a booking system I built from scratch six years ago. Not just any system, custom platform I spent eight months developing Handling everything from reservations to inventory to automated guest communications. It's sophisticated, proprietary and licensed under my software company's name. When we were happy, I gave them a sweetheart deal, $500 a month for software that would cost them 15 grand anywhere else. Over six years, I'd save them over $1 million. They'd grown comfortable. Father strutted around town talking about our family business like he'd built it all himself, forgetting the tech guy who made it actually function. I gave it three days. Then I sent the email. Professional, courteous, completely airtight, 30 days notice to turn, terminate the licensing agreement. They could migrate to a new system or pay market rate, $12,000 per month plus a $50,000 setup fee. Their family lawyer called within an hour, voice tight with panic. You can't just pull the software. We have contracts. Check section 7, sub section 3, I said calmly. Either party may.

For my entire childhood, my family had this group chat. Mom, dad, my older brother Tyler, and my younger sister Mia. Everyone except me. I found out when I was 16. I walked into the kitchen, and they were all laughing about something. When I asked what was funny, they got quiet. Tyler slipped and said it was just something in the chat. What chat? My mom tried to play it off, oh, just a silly family thing. You know how it is. But I didn't know because I wasn't in it. I thought maybe it was a mistake, so I asked my dad to add me later. He said, sure, honey, but he never did. Then I started noticing things. They'd all go to dinner on random Tuesdays, take weekend trips I only heard about after my sister got concert tickets from the family chat. My brother knew about my cousin's wedding three months before I did. Every single time I asked to be included, they'd say, oh, yeah, we'll add you, and then just wouldn't. I tried bringing it up seriously. Once sat my mom down and said, it really hurts that I'm not in the family chat. She laughed. Actually laughed. Sweetheart, you're so sensitive. It's just a group chat. Just a group chat where they planned literally everything without me. My dad said I was making a big Deal out of nothing. Tyler told me to stop being weird about it. Mia said you wouldn't even use it anyway. But how would they know? They never gave me the chance. Last year, my brother got engaged. I found out three weeks later when I saw the photos on Facebook. Three weeks? It all known the night it happened because he announced it in the chat. When I confronted him, he said, I figured someone told you. Nobody did, because nobody thought about me. Then came my mom's birthday last month. I showed up at her house with flowers and a gift I'd spent two hours picking out. When I walked in, they were all dressed up, grabbing their coats. Oh, my mom said, looking genuinely surprised to see me. We're just heading out to dinner. What dinner? She glanced at my dad. The reservation for my birthday. Nobody told me about a reservation. Tyler jumped in. We thought you were busy. I wasn't busy. I was never busy. They just didn't tell me. My sister said it was in the chat. Like that explained everything. I stood there holding flowers in a gift bag, watching my entire family awkwardly shuffle toward the door. My mom gave me this pitying smile. We can do something next week, just the two of us. I left the flowers on the counter and walked out. That's when I decided I was done asking. Christmas came around and I didn't reach out. Didn't Ask about plans. Didn't text to confirm anything. Just waited. Two days before Christmas. My sister texted you coming to mom and Dad's on the 25th? I said I wasn't invited. She sent me a screenshot from the group chat. The one I'm still not in. Where they've been planning for weeks. Menu, who is bringing what, what time to arrive. Everything. I stared at that screenshot for a long time. Then I replied, let me know when there's a chat I'm actually part of. She tried calling. I decline.

She laughed and said, you're going away. For a long time, she didn't realize the house was still legally mine. And the officer she called was my brother. He just looked at her and said, ma'am, you might want to call your lawyer. I'm standing on what used to be our porch when Vanessa opens the door with this twisted smile plastered across her face. The kind of smile that says she's been planning this moment. She announces, already pulling out her phone to dial 9 1 1. I warned you to stay away from my property. Your property? I ask, keeping my voice calm. Vanessa, I just came to get my tools from the garage. We agreed. We agreed to nothing. She cuts me off, her finger hovering over the call button. You're trespassing, and now you're going to jail. I'd moved out three weeks ago after our breakup got nasty. I've been staying at my parents place, trying to figure out the next steps. The house, the one I bought two years before we even met, was supposed to be sorted out through lawyers. Vanessa had been stalling, refusing to move out, claiming she had tenant rights. Today, I'd simply come to collect my power tools from the garage. I texted her that morning to let her know. She'd responded with, fine, whatever. But apparently she'd had other plans. She presses the button. I can hear The dispatcher's voice through the speaker 911, what's your emergency? Yes, my ex boyfriend just broke into my house, Vanessa says, her voice suddenly shaking, theatrical. I'm terrified. Please send someone quickly. He's very aggressive. I just stand there, hands in my pockets, waiting. Because here's what Vanessa doesn't know. I'm not worried. Not even a little bit. The cop car pulls up within six minutes. Fast response time. The door opens and an officer steps out, adjusting his belt. When he turns toward us, I see the exact moment Vanessa's smirk reaches its safe peek. She thinks she's won. What she doesn't know is that Officer Bradley isn't just any cop. He's my younger brother. Bradley walks up the driveway, his face completely neutral, professional. He glances at me with zero recognition. We talked about this exact scenario last week when Vanessa had threatened to make my life hell. Then turns his attention to her. Ma'am, what seems to be the problem here? Vanessa straightens up, playing the victim perfectly. Officer, thank god you're here. This man, she points at me dramatically, broke into my house. I want him arrested. Bradley pulls out his notepad, clicking his pen. Your house, you said? Yes, my house, she repeats, more confident now. And you own this property? I live here. Vanessa snaps, irritation creeping into her voice. We lived here together. Now it's mine. Ma'am, that's not what I asked. Bradley says, his tone still perfectly calm, do you own this Property? Is your name on the deed? It's my home. Bradley looks down at his notepad, then back at her. This house is registered solely to. He pauses, glancing at me. To this gentleman

You always tip good when you have money, he said. Coffee is cheap. Friendship isn't. Even my mailman noticed something was wrong. You usually order packages, Miguel said. Everything okay? When I explained, he brought me leftovers from his wife's cooking. Food shouldn't be wasted. After two months of watching my family completely abandoned me. While virtual strangers showed more kindness than I'd ever experienced, I was done with the experiment. I called a family meeting at my apartment. Everyone came, probably expecting me to ask for money again. Ashley brought her husband for backup. Alex looked annoyed to be there. My parents sat with their arms crossed like they were about to deliver bad news. I walked into the living room wearing my lottery winner T-shirt from the ceremony and carrying the framed photo. Remember when I was broke and needed help? I started watching their confused faces. Well, I wasn't. I pulled out the giant check photo and placed it on the coffee table. This whole time I've been a millionaire watching you treat me like garbage. The room explode. Ashley's face went white, then red. You've been lying to us for two months. Alex started stuttering apologies. I mean, I was going to help. I just thought you'd figure it out yourself. My parents were the angriest. This is manipulative, mom said. We raised you better than this. You want to talk about manipulation? I said, let's Talk about charging your unemployed son rent to live in his childhood bedroom. Dad stood up. We deserve our fair share of this money. We're your family. Family doesn't abandon each other, I replied. That's when I revealed my real surprise. I'd invited Margaret, Steve, Omar and Miguel to witness this moment. They've been waiting in the hallway. You four showed kindness to someone who couldn't help you back, I said as they filed in. Margaret, your nursing school is paid for, all $40,000. Steve, enjoy your new car. Omar, your daughter's wedding is covered. Miguel, your son's medical bills are handled. My family lost their minds. Ashley started screaming about blood being thicker than water, Alex, and to know why strangers were getting his inheritance. My parents threatened to disown me. You can't disown someone you already abandoned, I said. They stormed out, slamming doors and shouting about lawyers and family loyalty. My real family, the one I chose, stayed for pizza. Sometimes the people who owe you nothing give you everything.

You were supposed to do all the work for the group. It was agreed. Julie screamed at me in front of our history class, a blank slideshow with only our names was shown on the giant screen. Did you want us to fail? Julie hissed. You told me you had it. I say you did this on purpose. Julie stuttered. She kept flipping through blank note cards of our group project. The realization setting in that I didn't complete the group project like she wanted. Mr Cooper, Julie whined. He didn't do anything. She pointed a finger at me. You are a total loser. Mr Cooper had us sit back down. The entire class was laughing at Julie's red face. On Monday, my history teacher, Mr Cooper, had announced that on Friday we'd be presenting a history project. It was a slideshow and speech on World War 2. Mister Cooper gave us the guidelines and requirements and put us into groups of five. After class that afternoon, my group headed into the school library. Julie was the leader of the popular kids and thought she was the queen bee. Now I'm going to do the speaking because like I'm totally the best, Julie insisted before I even sat down. But like, totally. You're gonna actually do all the work, Julie demanded. I rolled my eyes, but I got to work anyway. I wasn't gonna let them ruin my grades. Christie I'm trusting you with the fashion. We can't look like total rejects. I don't think it matters what we look like. It's about our work, I said, and received an eye roll in return. I just wanted to get the project done. We have to work, Cameron asked, laughing, totally confused, throwing his football around. So did anyone see how awesome I was at the game last night? Cameron continued. Oh, Cameron, you were so sexy. Christie flirted. We should like totally go to my house. They started to talk and chat like it was lunch, period. Anytime I tried to speak, they got louder. So I tried to work on my part of the project. On Wednesday, I arrived at Christie's house and I could hear the music blasting. It looked like half the school had shown up. Cameron had the entire football team there. Kids were doing the devil's grass. Christie had hired a DJ. Julie was even drinking out of the red solo cups. Guys, I totally found the good stuff, Christie said, drunk out of her mind and holding two bottles of vodka. We we need to do our project. I had to shout over the music. We don't need your help, nerd. If you're so worried about it, finish it yourself. Leave, Julie snorted, pointing to the door. So I did. When I got home, I sent the project off to Julie's email, but there was nothing done. I even deleted my own work. If They didn't want my help. Fine, let I'm cook. Thursday at school, Julie grinned at me. Thanks for finishing the project. I guess you were useful after all. I just smiled and nodded. You're welcome. Anything for the group. I knew I had to talk to Mr Cooper. Cut to this morning. I had gotten to school early and went to his class. Mr Cooper, I need to explain something. I'm a little panicked. What if he didn't believe me? Luckily, he did. I showed him the entire slideshow.

He was running out the clock while improving what he thought would become his property. Then on day 27, a massive hotel style soaking tub showed up for the master bathroom with jets and built in mood lighting. The installation took six hours and two plumbers to connect everything, and the tub alone was $8,000. When they finished, Liam texted me a photo of himself in the tub holding a glass of wine with the caption living my best life. I forwarded it to my lawyer and told her we were moving. Day 29, I showed up with my grandmother. Liam answered the door in a bathrobe like he owned the place, and barely acknowledged us before heading back to make coffee on his new espresso machine. I walked my grandmother through every room, pointing out the upgrades with exaggerated excitement. She played along perfectly. Liam, this hot tub is incredible. And this new bedroom. You did all of this? He looked confused, but nodded slowly. I let her into the master bathroom and gestured at the massive tub. And this is the crown jewel. Liam spent weeks picking out every detail to thank me for letting him stay here during his hard time. My grandmother hugged him. That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard. Not many young people understand gratitude anymore. Liam opened his mouth, but I kept talking. I've been wanting to redo This kitchen for years, but never had time. Having you surprise me with all this as a gift is just incredible. His face went pale. Now that the project's done, you can head home and get back to your life. It's been almost 30 days. I handed him an envelope. This is your notice to vacate. You've got four hours. He ripped it open and his face turned red. You can't do this. I put over $75,000 into this place. I smiled. Into my place as a gift. Like I just told grandma, gifts don't come with conditions. He looked at my grandmother for support. I never said it was a gift. This is my house now. I've been living here. My grandmother's face fell. Liam, you just let him think you did all this out of kindness? That's very disappointing. Liam turned back to me, desperate. You knew what I was doing. You watched me do it. I shrugged. I watched you give me the most generous gift anyone's ever given me. Thank you so much for my new kitchen and bathroom. Liam tried to protest, but my grandmother was already walking toward the deck to try out the hot tub. He looked at me one last time, saw nothing but a smile, and left without packing. I called out thank you to my grandmother and turned to take a long bubble bath in my brand new soaking tub.

My cousin Liam called me three months ago asking to use my Delaware beach house for a weekend. He just gone through another breakup and needed somewhere quiet to think. I said sure because the place it's empty most weekends anyway, and he promised he'd be gone by Monday. When I handed him the keys, he grabbed me in a hug and said, you have no idea how much this means to me right now. I told him to enjoy the ocean and left it at that. Monday came and went without a word. I texted Tuesday morning asking if he was okay and he said the extended stay was doing wonders for his mental health and he'd be out by Friday. Friday became next Monday, then the following week, then excuses about car trouble and waiting for parts. Two weeks after I handed Liam the keys, my neighbour sent a photo of construction trucks in my driveway. I drove down immediately and walked into my house to find workers ripping out my kitchen cabinets while Liam stood there pointing at granite samples like he was choosing tile for his own renovation show. I stared at the gutted kitchen and asked what he thought he was doing. He didn't even look up from the countertop brochure in his hand. This kitchen is ancient and the layout makes no Sense I'm doing you a favor by fixing it while I'm here. You should be thanking me. I asked how he planned to pay for this and he waved me off. I've got it covered. You worry too much. Besides, it's not like you were using this place anyway. The contractor showed me the work order with Liam's name on it, requesting a full remodel with custom cabinets, stone countertops and new appliances. $28,000. I looked at Liam scrolling through his phone like this was all perfectly normal and something clicked. I told. I told the contractor everything looked great and to keep going. Then I walked out without another word. Over the next two weeks I watched my beach house transform into something I didn't recognise. A 15 thousand dollar hot tub appeared on the deck with crews running electrical lines and reinforcing the structure for three straight days. My neighbour kept me updated on the noise and the constant parade of trucks and I told her it would be over soon. All my furniture disappeared and got replaced with a 12 thousand dollar leather sectional, matching chairs and a glass dining table that probably cost more than both. A construction crew framed out a whole new bedroom addition off the back of the house with Florida ceiling windows facing the water and the permits and construction ran him another 14,000. I checked the county permits and found Liam had filed everything under his name as the property owner. Forging paperwork that said he had authority to make structural changes. I also checked tenant laws and realized what he was doing. After 30 days of continuous residence, he legal

I was in the bathroom during lunch when I heard two girls talking outside. Did you see Lena's test? Another hundred. Obviously she goes to Caldwell's tutoring. I sat there frozen because I just got my test back that morning. 54. I'd studied for hours and knew every answer. I rushed back to class and grabbed my test from my bag. Then I looked at Lena's desk. Her test was sitting there with 100 circled in green pen. We'd studied together the night before. I'd helped her understand half the material. During class, I glanced at her answers. They looked almost identical to mine. But mine was covered in red marks. After class, I caught up to her. My heart was pounding. Lena, how did you get 100? Our answers were the same. She wouldn't look at me. I go to Mister Caldwell's tutoring. You should try it. Then she walked away fast. That night, I laid my last three tests out. 58, 61, 54. Each one worse. Even though I studied harder. I needed to figure out what was happening. The next week, I went to Caldwell's classroom after school. I felt nauseous the entire walk there. Mister Caldwell, I need help understanding why I keep failing. He barely looked up. You're not putting in the effort. My chest got tight. But I study constantly. I know this material. He stared at me like I was the dumbest person he'd Ever seen? Then maybe history isn't your strong suit. You should consider switching to regular history. I felt my face getting hot. My answers are the same as students who are passing. His voice went ice cold. Are you accusing me of something? My mouth went dry. No, I just don't understand the grading. He waved his hand at me. Then figure it out yourself. I have work to do. I left feeling worthless. Next test came back worse. 49. I cried in the bathroom during lunch. Before turning that test in, I'd taken a photo of my answers. When I compared it to my graded test, I felt sick. Half my correct answers were marked wrong. Meanwhile, Lena showed me her test. Another hundred. One of her essay answers was three sentences that barely made sense. I showed her my photo, which was a full paragraph with dates and analysis. She glanced at it, then looked down. I don't want to talk about this. Her voice was quiet and scared. Over the next month, I noticed the pattern. Girls were getting top scores while guys were failing. I started sitting with three other guys from class. At lunch, we laid out our tests. All of us were failing despite knowing the material. All of us had jobs or sports after school. One of them said he'd asked Caldwell for help and got told to stop wasting his time. We started keeping track. 8 girls getting straight hundreds. 12 of Us failing everything. Then one of the guys said something that made my skin crawl. All those girls go to Caldwell after school, tutoring. Every single one of them. I went to my guidance counselor with this Pat. She looked at me like I was being dramatic. Mr. Caldwell has been here 15 years. If you're failing, maybe you need to take responsibility. Nobody would listen. Caldwell acted like I didn't exist. My grade dropped to a 46. I was going to fail this class, and nobody cared. In January, I can't take it anymore. I walk to the principal's office with the photos, the pattern and the proof. The three other guys are right behind me. We're done being quiet. The principal listens without interrupt

I raised my hand as a joke. I helped my mom watch YouTube videos when she was pregnant with my brother. Does that count? The class laughed and I smiled, proud of my quick thinking. But Mister Gonzales wasn't smiling. His face had gone completely white and his hands were shaking as he gripped the edge of his desk. Good. Come with me now. The entire classroom went silent in South Dallas when a teacher used that tone. You didn't ask questions. Everyone stay in your seats. Do not leave this room. If I'm not back in 20 minutes, have someone call 9, 1 1. He was already pulling me toward the door and that's when I noticed the dark stain on his sleeve. Wet. It looked like blood. Mr Gonzales, what's happening? Is someone hurt? I tried to pull my arm free, but his grip was iron tight. I don't think I'm qualified for whatever. You're the only one who raised their hand. He cut me off. That makes you qualified. Outside, his car was already running with the doors open. She said she had until Thursday. He kept muttering while speeding out of the school parking lot. The midwife isn't answering her phone I the door handle, calculating if I could jump out at the next red light. Mr Gonzales, you're scaring me. Should I call my mom? No. He swerved around. A car and I slammed into the window. No one can know. Put your phone away. Turn it off. I'm not turning off my phone, I shouted. But I did anyway. We were going 50 in a 25 zone and Mr Gonzales kept checking his mirrors like someone was following us. Finally, he pulled into a driveway of a small yellow house that definitely wasn't his. Listen to me. He grabbed my shoulders before we got out. They can't know she was here. Do you understand? No matter what happens, they can't know. I don't understand anything. I was practically yelling, now I'm 17. I don't even have my license yet. Marco. He used my name for the first time, his voice desperate. You've kept bigger secrets than this. I know your family. I need that same silence now. He wasn't wrong. I'd already seen two drive bys this year and never said a word to the cops. But this felt different. He shoved a pair of surgical gloves into my hands. Put these on. The front door was unlocked. Inside, we followed the sound of crying to a back bedroom where a woman was curled up on a bare mattress. She looked young, maybe early 20s, with long black hair stuck to her face with sweat. It's too early, she gasped in accented English when she saw us. Then she looked at me and started crying harder. He's just a child. You brought a child. I'm 17, I said. Stupid like that made any difference? I watch Grey's anatomy, if that helps. She switched to Spanish and started begging Mister Gonzales for something I couldn't understand. He pushed me toward her. Check how dilated she is. What? I backed up so fast I knocked over.

I faked being broke after winning the lottery to see who'd stick around. Last month, I won 2.4 million on a scratch off at the gas station near my apartment. The cashier congratulated me. I signed the back, took the photo with the giant check, the whole thing. But instead of celebrating, I had this sinking feeling about what would happen when my family found out. See, I'd always been the one they called when they needed money, car repairs, rent, medical bills. I was their personal ATM. But I'd never been in real trouble myself, so I didn't know if they'd return the favor. So I decided to test them. I locked the lottery ticket in a safety deposit box and started my performance. First, I called out sick from my warehouse job for a week, then told everyone I'd been fired for attendance issues, budget cuts. I said last hired, first fired. Then I started the money complaints. Rent was due, bank account was empty, unem employment wouldn't kick in for weeks. I sold my PlayStation, my bike, anything that looked valuable made it look desperate. The reactions were brutal and immediate. My sister Ashley, who I'd helped with three different car payments, stop up inviting me to family dinners. We can't afford extra mouths right now, she said when I asked about Sunday dinner. Maybe when you get back on your feet. My brother Alex, whose Entire college tuition I'd covered when our parents couldn't suddenly never answered my calls. When he finally texted back, it was always busy with work or can't talk right now. This from the guy who used to call me twice a week. My parents were the worst. Suggested I move back into my childhood bedroom but wanted me to pay them $800 a month rent. It'll teach you responsibility, dad said. Maybe this is the wake up call you needed. Meanwhile, my elderly neighbor, Margaret, who I barely knew beyond polite hallway conversations, started showing up with groceries. Everyone needs help sometimes, she said, refusing to let me pay her back. Just help someone else when you can. My coworker Steve from the warehouse offered to cover my lunch every day.

She didn't name me directly, but everyone knew. She made another post implying I was too focused on work to keep a boyfriend. All lies. I blocked her, muted their numbers, deleted their emails. Their problem, not mine. A week later, I flew to Florida to see my grandfather, Walter. He'd always been fair, the only one who saw through their bullshit. I told him everything. The dinner, dad's toast, Vanessa's lies, the years of sending $600 monthly while they praised her for nothing. Grandpa Walter's face hardened. That's not family. That's betrayal. He called his lawyer that afternoon. I'm changing the will, he said firmly. They don't deserve a cent. He cut out Mom, Dad and Vanessa completely. Everything, his properties, his land, his entire estate went to me. You've earned it, he said. Not for what you've done but for who you are. I flew back to Chicago the next day, didn't call them, didn't check their messages. I focused on my work instead. Landed a huge client, a tech startup worth $2.5 million. My boss hinted at a promotion to senior manager. Meanwhile, their store collapsed without me. The $600 monthly payments stopped. Suppliers cut them off. A tax audit hit them $30,000 in penalties. Problems I've been preventing for years. The bank for closed, the store closed permanently. Vanessa's dreams of expanding into a chain, dead Busters pulled out immediately. Her Facebook lies, Backfired, too. Family members started digging and found my bank statements, proof I've been funding everything. You lied about her. One aunt commented, she carried all of you. Vanessa's reputation crumbled. Co workers whispered. Family unfollowed her. Mom and dad lost everything. Without the store's income, they couldn't pay their second mortgage. The bank seized their house. They moved into a tiny apartment, cramming their belongings into storage. Relatives who'd once praised them now avoided their calls, stopped inviting them to gatherings. Grandpa Walter didn't budge. He sent me a letter confirming the new will. It's done. They get nothing. When mom called begging for a meeting, he refused. You made your bed. He blocked Vanessa's number. Dad never even tried reaching out. Six months after that dinner, I got a call from a cousin. Your parents are selling everything they own, she said. The house is gone. Vanessa's bouncing between retail jobs. They're completely broke. I felt nothing, no guilt, no sadness, just relief.

I'd spent four years raising her, loving her, fighting for weekend custody. What if she wasn't even mine? The thought made me sick, but I couldn't ignore it. A week later, another visitor, Brandon, Emily's brother. I need to tell you something, he said. I've been carrying this guilt for too long. I. What guilt? Lucy might not be yours. Emily was with Cole when she got pregnant. She never knew for sure who the father was. He just chose you. She chose me. You had the stable job, the house. Cole was broke. She picked the better option. I sat there stunned. I'm sorry, man. I should have told told you years ago. The rest of my time in jail was different. I wasn't defeated anymore. I had a mission. When I got out, I went straight to a lawyer. I need a paternity test and I want to sue for fraud. If she's not mine, we can do that. We set a court date. Two weeks later, I showed up for the test. Emily was already there with Lucy. She looked furious, arms crossed. Lucy saw me and ran over, wrapped her little arms around me. That hit me hard. I'd spent years thinking she was my daughter, raising her, loving her. Now I was about to find out if that was even true. Two weeks later, the envelope arrived. I tore it open. 0% I Wasn't her father? Just like that. Four years of my life felt ripped away. I called my lawyer immediately. I wanna sue Emily for fraud, for emotional damage, for every dollar of child support I paid. We can do that. I'll get the paperwork started. The court date arrived. I walked into the courtroom. My lawyer met me at the door. Emily was already seated, looking put together, but her eyes gave her away. She knew what was coming. The trial started. Emily went first, claimed she hadn't known who Lucy's father was, that she believed it was me. Tried to play the hero for keeping the secret to protect our family. Then my lawyer stood up. He laid it all out. The letter from Brandon, the paternity test, years of child support payments. And there's something else, your honour. My lawyer said Emily's boyfriend, Cole, is Lucy's biological father and she's been collecting child support from both of them. The courtroom gasped. Emily's face went white. The judge looked at the paternity test, then at Emily, then at me. Full story linked below on the channel.

I was devastated but also angry. We were supposed to travel to Europe next summer. She promised we'd finally do that sister trip we talked about for years. At her funeral, so many people I didn't know came up to me saying how much she talked about me, her brilliant little sister who was going places. It felt like they were talking about someone else's sister. Dad handed me her personal effects in a small box. Her phone was still working. I scrolled through her calendar and saw dozens of reminders about my life, my exam dates, my work presentation, even my dentist appointment next month. She had an alert set for my favorite band's new album release. I sat in my car for an hour just staring at these digital bread crumbs of her love. While cleaning out her apartment, I found this worn leather journal. Inside was her neat handwriting dated 16 years ago. The first entry was from when I was 7. Mom's not doing well. The doctor say she has weeks. She made me promise to look after sis. I'm only fifteen, but I swore I would. I never knew our mom was sick. Dad always told me she died suddenly from a heart condition. I kept reading. Every page detailed how my sister rearranged her entire life to keep her promise. She turned down her dream college because it Was too far from home. She worked nights so she could walk me to school in the mornings. She scheduled her classes around my activities so I'd never be alone. There was an entry from the night of that concert. She's so mad at me for showing up, but there were older guys hanging around. I'd rather have her angry than hurt. And about Ryan found out he got arrested for dealing. Can't tell her how I know. Dad's police friend tipped me off. She'll understand someday. The last entry was from the week before she died. Sometimes I wonder if she resents how much I'm in her business. But I promised mom I'd keep her safe. Maybe someday she'll understand it wasn't control, it was love.

I always thought my older sister was overprotective. Growing up, she'd walk me to school, even though her high school was in the opposite direction. She'd check my homework, pack my lunches, and always asked who I was hanging out with. It drove me crazy. When I was 13, I wanted to go to my first concert with friends. No parents, just us. She insisted on coming along, sitting rose behind us like some kind of shadow. I remember the burning embarrassment when my friend spotted her. I didn't speak to her for days afterward. In high school, she somehow always knew when I was hanging out with Ryan, this guy she thought was trouble. She'd conveniently need to pick me up early or would show up with some urgent reason. One night, she literally pulled me out of a party where there was drinking. I screamed at her in the car that she was ruining my life. She just gripped the steering wheel tighter and said, hate me now if you need to. When I moved away for college, she'd call every Sunday without fail. She'd ask about my classes, if I was eating right, did I need money for books. I'd rush through these calls, annoyed at her constant hovering. Sometimes I'd accidentally miss her calls, texting later with flimsy excuses. For my 21st birthday, she surprised me by flying cross country. I had plans with friends. That weekend. But she'd already booked us tickets to this play I'd mentioned once months before. I reluctantly canceled my parties. She seemed so happy during that weekend that I couldn't bring myself to tell her how much her visit had disrupted my life. Last year she planned this huge family reunion for our parents anniversary. I complained the whole time about taking time off work. She just smiled and said, family is everything, kiddo. During that weekend, she pulled me aside and made me promise to come home for Christmas. No excuses this time, she said, hugging me tighter than usual. I promised half heartedly.

I smiled, as you wish, Dad. Six months later, their empire crumbled without me. We wish Vanessa was our only child. My dad said it at their 35th anniversary dinner. Glass raised, voice clear eyes on me. The entire restaurant went silent. Aunts, uncles, cousins all staring. My sister Vanessa smirked, savoring every second. I didn't cry, didn't yell, just stood up, grabbed my purse and walked out. My heels clicked against the hardwood floor as something inside me finally snapped. For years I've been there. Invisible fix it person daughter. They ignored while praising Vanessa for everything. I won a math competition. They missed it. For Vanessa's recital, I got promoted to finance manager. They spent the entire family dinner talking about Vanessa's retail job and their store, their precious failing business. I've been keeping it alive for years, $600 every month from my own pocket. Hours of free financial advice, negotiating with suppliers, fixing their tax problems, optimizing their inventory. Did they thank me? Never. They'd call Vanessa instead, bragging about how her marketing ideas saved the day. At that anniversary dinner, I tried one last time. I've been analyzing the store's numbers. I said if you streamline inventory and cut some suppliers, you could save thousands. Vanessa raised an eyebrow. Inventory? That's adorable. I have real ideas. The table laughed. Mom cut in sharply. Let's not bore everyone with numbers, sweetie. Dad didn't even look at Me, Vanessa knows what she's doing. Then came his toast, his wish that Vanessa was their only child. At night, I sat alone in my apartment and made a decision. I grabbed my phone and typed into our family group chat, I'm done helping with the store. No more money, no more advice. Good luck. I hit send and turned off my phone. By morning, I had 11 missed calls. Dad's voicemails went from confused to angry. Mom sent long emails about family legacy. Vanessa called twice, demanding I stop overreacting. I ignored every single one. Three days later.

And I just, he held up his hand to stop me. Brian, how long have you been working here? Three years, I said, confused about where this was going. And in those three years, have you ever called in sick? I thought about it. No, I don't think so. Have you ever missed a deadline? No. Have you ever complained about overtime or weekend work? No. But I don't understand what this has to do with. Rick leaned back in his chair. That text wasn't meant for me, but it told me something important. It showed me how you talk about the people you care about, the respect and appreciation you have. Most people would have been complaining about taking care of a sick wife and a cranky baby, but you were praising her. I just stared at him not sure what to say. We've been looking for someone to promote to senior analyst, Rick continued. Someone who can handle stress, who appreciates their team, who doesn't crack under pressure. I've been watching you this week and even though you're clearly exhausted, you haven't dropped the ball once. My brain was struggling to process what was happening. Are you saying? I'm saying that Accidental Text showed me more about your character than any interview could. The job comes with a 20% raise and your own office interested. I sat there in shock for a minute, but I called you babe. Rick laughed. My wife. Thinks it's hilarious. He said, anyone who talks about their family like that is someone she'd want me working with. I took the promotion, obviously, but the best part came later that day when I texted Emma the good news. She wrote back, wait, so you got promoted because you accidentally told your boss you wanted to hug him? I replied pretty much. Her response was just crying, laughing emojis, and this is the most ridiculous thing that's ever happened to us.

Mom, Potato likes me, he smiled. The potato has feelings. After that, she was obsessed, but in the weirdest way. She'd narrate his entire existence to anyone who'd listen. That's my brother, potato. He can't do anything. He just lays there and leaks from both ends. Sometimes he screams for no reason, but he likes me best. At the grocery store, my mom made a potato baby. He's useless but cute. To the mailman, Wanna see my potato brother? Warning, he might poop while you're looking at preschool show and tell. She brought a picture. This is James, but I call him potato because he looked like one when he was born. He's better looking now, but still can't do anything useful. She appointed herself his translator. He'd cry and she'd announce. Potato wants milk, potato needs a new diaper. Potato is bored of existing, usually wrong, but she tried. Now James is 18 months old, walking and talking. Lucy still calls him potato, but lovingly. He thinks it's his name. His first word wasn't Mama or Dada. It was Tato. Pointing at himself last week at the park, another mom asked his name. James, I said potato. Kids corrected in unison. The mom looked confused. Lucy explained he was ugly when he was born, so I called him potato. Now he's cute, but the name stuck, right, Potato? James nodded proudly. I Tato. I've accepted that my son will probably be called potato. Until college, maybe beyond. Lucy's already planning to tell his future girlfriends about how he was born looking like a root vegetable. But watching her teach him to go down the slide yesterday, yelling, you can do it, potato, potato, potatoes are brave, while he giggled hysterically, worth every embarrassing public explanation of why my toddler responds to potato better than his actual name, though I am saving for his future therapy bills. My sister convinced me I was a potato is definitely going to come up. At least she loves her little spud.

My four year old daughter, Lucy had been preparing for months. Made drawings of me and my baby brother, practice diaper changing on her dolls, even saved her allowance to buy him a teddy bear. When we brought baby James home, she took one look at him and burst into tears. What's wrong with his face? James was perfectly healthy, but newborns aren't exactly Instagram ready. Red, wrinkled eyes, swollen shut. Lucy was expecting a Gerber baby. She got a potato with hair. Take him back! This isn't the baby from the pictures she. I meant the pregnancy app images we'd shown her. Chubby, smiling, adorable three month olds. Not fresh from the womb. Reality. For three days, she refused to look at him, called him the wrinkly thing, and asked when the real baby was coming. I'd catch her peeking at him from around corners, then running away disgusted. Day four, she approached cautiously while I was nursing. Stared at him for a full minute. Why is he eating from your body? That's gross. Give him real food. I explained how babies eat. Her response, I'm never having babies. This is too weird. But then James opened his eyes and looked right at her. She gasped, mom, the potato has eyes! From then on, she called him potato. Not mainly, just matter of factly. Can I hold potato? Potato. Is crying again. Why does potato smell so bad? Week 2 she started warming up. Brought him her toys, but was offended when he didn't play with them. I gave him my best Barbie and he just laid there. Rude. Week 3 she tried teaching him to talk. Say Lucy, Lucy, come on, it's easy. Got frustrated when he just drooled. Mom, I think potato is broken. He's leaking! The turning point came when he smiled at her. A real smile, not gas. She screamed.

I followed him, already mentally packing up my desk. I was rehearsing my explanation in my head, trying to figure out how to explain that I wasn't a complete weirdo. Rick closed the door and sat down across from me. So he said, I got your text. I wanted to disappear into the floor. Rick, I'm so sorry. That was meant for my wife.

Wesley's chest puffed out. Good. Call the landlord. I'm taking over this lease anyway. Melanie and I are common law now. Five minutes later, Mr Sanders walked in with his master keys jingling. He was this sixty year old Brooklyn native who'd owned the building for 30 years. He took one look at the scene. Wesley with his bags, Mitchell trying to look intimidating, Melanie shrinking into the couch and me standing there calm as could be. What's going on here? Mr Sanders asked, though his slight smirk told me he already knew. Wesley stepped forward with all the confidence of someone who'd watched too many law shows. I'm moving in and she's moving out. I've been living here for three months, which makes me a tenant. Melanie and I are together, so I'm taking over her half of the lease. Mr Sanders looked at Wesley like he just said the earth was flat. Then he started laughing. Not a chuckle, but a full belly laugh that went on for a solid 30 seconds. Wesley's face started twitching. What's so funny, old man? Mr Sanders wiped his eyes and pulled out his phone. Let me show you something, son. He pulled up a document. This is the lease for apartment 2C. See that single name? That's not Melanie. That's not you. That's her. He pointed at me. There is no Melanie on this lease. She's been subletting from her, which Technically, I only allowed as a favor. Wesley turned to Melanie, his mouth hanging open. You said you were on the lease. Melanie looked at the floor. I thought I was. Mr Sanders continued, clearly enjoying himself. And you, young man, aren't even supposed to be here. The lease specifically states overnight guests, maximum three nights per week. You've been violating that for months. I could have you trespassed right now. Mitchell started backing toward the door. Wesley was frozen. But I, I'm getting mail here. That doesn't mean anything. Mr Sanders laughed. My cat gets mail here, too. Doesn't mean he owns the place. Wesley looked at me, then at Melanie, then back at Mr Sanders. This can't be legal. Oh, it's completely legal. In fact, you have exactly five minutes to grab your bags and leave before I call the police. And Melanie, you might want to start looking for your own place. Your subletting agreement ends next month. Wesley grabbed his bags, Mitchell already halfway to the elevator. Melanie ran after them, crying.

Take your hands off my daughter now. This is ridiculous. Katie, tell them the kid is lying, the groom demanded. But Katie, the bride, was shaking her head. She's not lying, dad. Show them your phone. Tyler, what? Tyler looked panicked. Now show them the texts you sent me last night when I said I wanted to postpone the wedding. Tyler started backing away. This is insane. I'm not showing anyone anything. But Katie was already pulling out her own phone. Then I'll show them mine, he started reading out loud. You better not embarrass me tomorrow or you'll regret it. You're nothing without me. If you try to leave, I'll make sure no one ever wants you. The wedding guests started murmuring. Some people were pulling out their phones to record. Tyler realized he was cornered and completely lost it. Fine. Yeah, I said that she needed to hear it. She was being dramatic about nothing. One little fight and she wanted to call off our whole wedding. Katie's dad moved between Tyler and his daughter. Get out now before I call the police. Tyler started yelling about how much money he'd spent on the wedding, how Katie was ruining everything, how her family never liked him anyway. Two of Katie's brothers stepped up next to their dad and Tyler finally realized he was outnumbered. This is all your fault, he said, pointing at me and Emma. You and your weird kid ruined my life. No, Katie said firmly. You ruined your own life the first time you put your hands on me. Tyler stormed off and Katie sat down on a park bench still in her wedding dress, crying. Not sad crying, but relief crying. Her mom and sisters gathered around her and her dad was already on the phone, probably canceling venues and vendors. I was about to leave them alone when Katie called out, wait, please. She walked over to us. What's your daughter's name? Emma, I said. Katie knelt down again. Emma, thank you for being brave and telling the truth. You saved me from making a big mistake. Emma just nodded, seriously, like this was a normal Tuesday for her. My mommy says truth is always better, even when it's scary. Katie looked at me. You're raising an incredible kid. I'm so sorry about what you went through before. We're okay now, I said. And it looks like you will be, too.

The landlord started laughing. My roommate's boyfriend, Wesley, had been planning this moment for months, ever since he started staying over back in June. He'd been telling his boys about how he was finessing his way into a free apartment. He even started forwarding his mail here to establish what he called residency rights. The relationship wasn't even official before Wesley started making his move. He'd walk around my apartment, well, what he thought was going to be his apartment, measuring room and telling his cousin which wall would be perfect for his TV setup. Melanie's been carrying this dead weight for too long, he'd mutter while eating my groceries. Time for her to learn she doesn't need a roommate anymore. So there I was, standing in my own living room on a Thursday night. The whole place smelled like the Cologne Wesley bathed in. Wesley showed up with his cousin Mitchell and two duffel bags, already acting like he owned the place, both of them looking like they were ready to physically move me out if needed. Melanie, I hope you found somewhere else to stay, Wesley said, dropping his bags by the door. This is happening tonight. You've been taking advantage of my girl's kindness for long enough. I stayed quiet, scrolling through my phone, let him have his moment. Melanie sat on the couch, avoiding eye contact with everyone. Wesley had been working on her for weeks. Convincing her that I was holding her back, that they needed their privacy, that couples shouldn't have roommates. She'd started parroting his words recently. Maybe it's time for a change. Maybe we've outgrown this arrangement. Classic Wesley manipulation. The man didn't even have his own place. He'd been couch surfing before he latched onto Melanie. Wesley pulled out a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket. I printed out this 30 day notice. But honestly, you to just go tonight. Make this easy on everyone. Mitchell nodded like this was all perfectly legal. Smart move, Wesley. She's had a free ride long enough. I looked at the paper and almost laughed. He downloaded some random eviction template and just wrote my name on it in pen. Melanie finally spoke up, her voice barely a whisper. Maybe we can give her the weekend at least. Wesley shot her a look that made her shut up immediately. Nah, baby, we discussed this. She goes tonight. That's when I made the call. Hey, Mister. Sanders, I said, putting him on speaker. Could you

The bride stopped mid pose. Her photographer looked confused and about 30 wedding guests turned to stare at my three year old daughter Emma standing by the playground swings. I was mortified. Emma had this habit of saying random things loudly at the worst possible moments, but this was next level embarrassing. Emma, honey, let's go play on the slides, I whispered, trying to drag her away from the wedding party, but she wasn't having it. She broke free from my grip and marched right up to the bride, tugging on her dress. Lady, don't marry the mean man, Emma said, pointing directly at the groom. He's gonna hurt you. Everyone went dead silent. The groom's face went red and he started walking toward us looking angry. Hey, what kind of kid says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just 3 and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve. My mommy had marks like that when the bad man lived with us. She cried at night, too, just like you smell like tears under your makeup. My heart stopped. This kid had been through way too much for her age, but she developed This weird ability to spot things adults tried to hide. When my ex was still around, Emma would always know when I've been crying, even if I thought I'd covered it up perfectly. The bride's face went pale. She looked down at her wrist, back at Emma. You're very smart, little girl. Then she stood up and looked at her groom. We need to talk right now. What? No, we're not doing this here because some random kid made stuff up, the groom said, grabbing the bride's arm. But he grabbed it right where the bruise was. And she winced visibly. That's when the bride's dad stepped forward. He was a big guy. Probably worked.

But I wanted to do more than just get him kicked off. I started documenting everything. I took screenshots of him changing my playlists, recorded videos of songs suddenly switching while I was using the app, and even got my friend to witness him controlling my music from across the classroom. Then I found out something interesting. Ben had been bragging to other people about hacking not just my account, but several other students accounts too. He thought it was hilarious that he could mess with people's music and make them look stupid. So I reached out to those other kids and found out they had the same experience. Random music playing at inappropriate times, embarrassing songs showing up in their recent activity playlists, getting messed with. Some of them had even gotten in trouble with their parents when explicit songs started playing through their home speakers. We all decided to report this together. But instead of just going to Spotify, we went to the school administration first. Turns out what Ben was doing counts as cyberbullying and harassment. And our school has a zero tolerance policy for that kind of stuff. The school called his parents and mine for a meeting. When they showed all the evidence we had collected, Ben's face went completely white. His parents were furious because they had no idea their son was using his computer skills to torment other students. But here's where it gets Really good. The school decided to involve the police because technically what Ben did was unauthorized access to other people's accounts, which is actually illegal. They called it computer fraud and abuse. Ben started crying and begging everyone not to press charges. He promised he would stop and even offered to help us secure our accounts better. But it was too late. The damage was done and we were all fed up with his behavior. The police officer explained that even though we were all minors, this kind of digital harassment was taken seriously. Ben ended up getting charged with multiple counts of unauthorized computer access and cyberbullying. His parents had to hire a lawyer and pay thousands of dollars in legal fees. He got suspended from school for two weeks and had to do community service. The court also ordered him to stay away from all of us and prohibited him from using any social media or streaming services for six months.

So there's this kid at school named Ben who thinks he's some kind of tech genius. He's always bragging about how he can hack into anything and showing off with his fancy coding skills. Most people just ignore him, but he made the mistake of targeting me last month. I was sitting in the library working on an essay when Ben comes over and starts looking at my laptop screen. I had Spotify open in another tab because I was listening to music while I worked. Starts laughing and says my playlist is trash and asks if he can show me some real music. I said no thanks and went back to my work, but Ben doesn't take no for an answer. He pulls out his phone and starts typing away and suddenly my Spotify starts skipping songs. Then it switches to some death metal band I've never heard of. I look at him and he's got this smug grin on his face, whispers that he's connected to my account and can control it from his phone. Then he starts blasting the volume up and down just to mess with me. The librarian comes over and tells me to keep it down, which was embarrassing because everyone was staring. I told Ben to stop, but he just kept going. He changed my playlist name to something stupid and started adding weird songs to it. When I tried to change it back on my laptop, he Would just override it from his phone. It was like playing tug of war with my own account. The worst part was when he started following random people on my account and liking their playlists. Some of them were really inappropriate ones with explicit names. I was mortified because all my friends could see this stuff in their activity feed. After about 20 minutes of this torture, I finally had enough. I grabbed my stuff and left the library. But even at home he was still messing with my account. Songs would randomly start playing in the middle of the night or my playlists would get deleted and recreated with terrible music. This went on for three days. Ben would walk past me in the hallway and smirk, knowing he had complete control over my Spotify. He even changed my profile picture to some meme of a crying baby. I tried changing my password, but somehow he still had access. That's when I came up with my plan. I did some research and found out that Spotify has a feature with

My 10 year old son came home confused because his history teacher told the class that the Great Wall of China is visible from space with the naked eye. My son Alex has always been fascinated by space. Since he was five, we've spent countless nights stargazing with our telescope. He knows all the planets and can recite facts about the International Space Station. Last year, I bought him a book signed by Chris Hadfield, the famous astronaut. Alex treasures it and can quote entire passages about what earth actually looks like from space. But everything changed when Mr Peterson started teaching history during a lesson about ancient wonders, told the class that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space with the naked eye. Alex raised his hand and explained that astronauts have confirmed this isn't true. The wall is too narrow and blends with the landscape. He mentioned that Hadfield's typically addressed this myth in his book. Mister Peterson cut him off. That's nonsense, he said. It's in our textbook and I've been teaching this fact for 20 years. Your little astronaut book is wrong. The next day, Alex brought in his signed book to show the passage. Instead of listening, Mister Peterson confiscated it, calling it disruptive material. He made Alex stand in front of the class and recite the Great Wall of China is visible from space. 10 times. When Alex came home, he was devastated. His precious signed book was gone and he felt humiliated. Mister Peterson had assigned a 5 page essay on the importance of respecting teacher's knowledge as punishment. I was furious. I emailed Mister Peterson explaining the facts and asking for the book back. His response, I don't need space facts from a parent. The curriculum says the wall is visible from space. That's what I teach. The principal seemed reluctant to contradict a 10 year teacher over what she called a minor factual dispute. That's when I decided to take action. My college roommate now work.

He said, my mom told me not to talk to him ever, said it would mess everything up. He just glared at me until I told him I had no idea what he was talking about.

Explained how my grandfather paid his mom off to never say anything and never told his wife or my dad that he existed. But his mom told him when he was young about the entire situation. She admitted she was really hard on him. She constantly insisted that the name, the house, the family, it should belong to him, not me. I felt the floor tilt beneath me. I said, you bullied me because you were jealous. He flinched and said, no, yes, I don't know. I hated you because you had Everything. I wasn't allowed to want a dad who loved you, a real home. I wanted a brother, but I wasn't allowed to be with the one I had. We sat in silence once, not out of avoidance, but grief muted and shared. Later that week, I pulled out an old photo album, showed him pictures of my dad in a Santa suit falling off the roof because he thought it'd be funny to land on the sleigh.

Grandfather was the last thread connecting me to anything that felt like home. when the lawyer handed me the will and said I'd inherited the estate, I didn't feel joy, just more weight. But there was a catch. Of course there was. The lawyer said to claim full ownership, you'll need to live on the property for one year with another party also named in the will. And that other party turned out to be Caleb, the same Caleb who used to shove my face into my mashed potatoes in the cafeteria for an hour in 8th grade. Childhood bully. I laughed at the lawyer and said, this has to be a joke. That's when he walked in wearing a weathered leather jacket with his arms crossed and a face like he'd rather be anywhere else. Caleb said, trust me, if it is, I'm not laughing either. Neither of us wanted to spend our time together, but free housing in this economy was no joke. So we both signed and moved in. We avoided each other like a mouse would avoid a cat, only neither of us knew who the cat was. The house was massive enough that We barely crossed paths until the peanut thing. I was eating trail mix in the kitchen when he walked in, froze and said, you trying to kill me? I blinked and said, you allergic? He said, all it would take was one whiff and it's Epipen and ambulance time. I told him that my dad had the same allergy. Caleb's eyes flicked to mine and something passed there, something like recognition, guilt. It was gone before I could catch it. The days dragged into weeks. We didn't speak much, but the silence began to change. It softened. I caught him fixing the broken gutter one morning without being asked. Then I started leaving coffee on the counter for him as he rushed to work each morning.

My stepsister, Miranda is the type of person who I cried for three days straight when my dad got her a birthday ring that only cost $4,000. Not because she was great, because it wasn't expensive enough. She's been part of our family for three years ever since my dad remarried way too quick after my mom passed away. From day one, Miranda made it her sole mission to erase my mother's memory from our house. She literally banned us from mentioning her name. Her relationship with the rest of the family, total disaster. My uncle banned her from his house after she got drunk and started a fight. Every family gathering became an awkward dance of people trying to avoid her. But her and my grandmother, that was next level hatred. They openly despise iced each other at Christmas dinner two years ago. Miranda literally called her a bitch in front of everyone because grandma wouldn't compliment her new dress. My dad was the only one who couldn't see through Miranda's ass. Every time I tried to explain what she was really like, he'd call me jealous and disrespectful. Then six months ago, everything changed overnight. My grandmother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The doctors gave her maybe half a year. It was devastating for all of us. But Miranda, suddenly she transformed into the World's most caring stepdaughter. She started calling my grandmother every single day, texting her good morning messages, showing up with medicine, chocolate, flowers. She even offered to quit her job to be Grandma's full time caretaker for free. The whole family watched this performance in disbelief. Here's the thing. My grandmother was incredibly wealthy. She owned properties, had investments, and everyone knew her nest egg was massive. And Miranda loved expensive things more than anything in the world. For six months, we watched Miranda put on this elaborate show. She'd break down crying at family dinners about how heartbroken she was. She'd post him emotional Facebook updates about cherishing loved ones. My grandmother, though, she saw right through it. She was sharp as ever, even while battling cancer. I'd visit her and she'd just smile knowingly whenever Miranda's name came up. And last week, my grandmother passed away peacefully. At the funeral, Miranda was practically the star of the show, crying louder than anyone, talking about what an amazing woman grandma was and how much she'd miss her. Three days later came the will reading. We all gathered at the lawyer's office. Miranda walked in wearing all black, still playing the grieving granddaughter role, but she'd done her makeup perfectly and was wearing expensive jewelry. The lawyer started reading through the will. My uncle got grandma's car collection. My aunt got some property. I got a trust fund for college and grandma's book collection. Miranda was literally sitting on the Edge of her seat practically vibrating with excitement. She kept adjusting her hair and smiling. Then the lawyer cleared his throat and said Miranda's name. The room went completely silent. Miranda sat up straighter, her eyes wide with anticipation. The lawyer read to Miranda, who spent six months pretending to care about a.

Two years ago, I took a construction job to help pay for Trevor's wedding expenses. I wanted to contribute since money was tight and I knew how important this day was to him. I was working on scaffolding when it collapsed. I felt three stories. I remember hitting the ground. The pain was unreal. Broke my spine in two places, shattered my leg, broke three ribs. I was rushed into emergency surgery. The doctors told me later I was lucky to be alive. The hospital called my parents while I was being. My mom answered. Here's what she told the doctor. We can't come right now. It's two days before my son's wedding and we have too much to handle. Not is he okay, not we'll be right there, just we're busy. I was in surgery for six hours. When I woke up, the only person there was my best friend, Levi. He got in a call from the hospital since he was my emergency contact at work. He's stay the entire time. My parents didn't show up that night or the next day. I spent that first week in the most pain I've ever experienced. I couldn't move without help. I couldn't even sit up. The nurses kept asking where my family was. I didn't know what to tell them. When I could finally use my phone, I called my mom straight to voicemail. I called my dad, same thing. I texted them both, I'm awake. Please come. Nothing. I texted Trevor, hey, I know the wedding is soon, but I really need you guys. Read receipt. No response. Levi and his girlfriend stayed with me every day. They brought me food the hospital cafeteria didn't have. They smuggled in my favorite snacks, kept me saying. But every time visiting hours started, I'd look at the door hoping to see my family. They never came. The wedding day arrived. I was still in the ICU. That morning, I got a voicemail from my mom. She said, honey, we're so sorry we haven't been able to visit. Today's Trevor's big day and we just can't be in two places at once. We'll come see you in a few days. Hope you're feeling better. Hope you're feeling better. Like I had the flu, Trevor never called, not once. Later, I found out why. My parents had told him about the accident and he said, and I quote, don't let this become drama at my wedding. We can deal with it. After I was his little brother, I'd agreed to be his best man and I was drama. The wedding happened without me. I saw the photos later on Facebook, everyone smiling, dancing, celebrating. My parents posted about the perfect day and their perfect son. Not a single mention of me. Three weeks went by. I was transferred to a Rehab facility. I had to relearn how to walk. The physical therapy was brutal. Every step felt like my spine was going to snap again. Levi's parents offered to let me stay with them during recovery. They became the family mine refused to be. Week 4, my parents finally showed up at the rehab center. I thought maybe they'd come to apologize, to explain, to check on me. Instead, my mom sat down and said, we need to talk about what you did. I was confused what I did. She said some relatives had heard about my accident and were upset. They didn't come to the hospital. Apparently, this had caused tension at the wedding reception. Some people left early. Some people made.

It was an investment. Will took another sip of beer. Best money I ever spent. Jen was staring at him like she'd never seen him before. Will, what the hell is wrong with you? Nothing's wrong with me. I'm senior partner at my firm. I'm successful. Jackson's the one teaching teenagers about the Constitution for 40 grand a year. Sarah's nails were digging into my palm. You sick son of a Sarah. Mom interrupted, but her voice was shaking. I couldn't breathe. Every late night studying, every practice test, every time I told myself I just wasn't cut out for it. All of it was a lie. Remember when you cried after the second failure? Will was smiling now. Called me at 2 in the morning, said you didn't know if you should try again. That was my favorite part. You comforted him, Jen whispered. You told him to keep trying. Had to make it convincing. I looked at my hands. These hands that graded essays instead of writing legal briefs. These hands that erased whiteboards instead of signing contracts. I gave up. I said, yeah, you did. Will stood up, stretching. Anyway, that's my 3. What did you think? Pretty good game, right? Dad stood up too slowly. He was looking at will like he was a stranger. Get out, dad said. Oh, come on. It's just get out. Mom was crying now, silent tears running down her face. I don't know you, she said to will. I don't know who you are. It's not that big a deal. You destroyed your brother's life for fun, Jen said, for $15,000 in fun. Will looked around the room, his smile finally fading. You're all overreacting. The bar exam, I said quietly. I'm taking it again next month. What? I never stopped studying. I met his eyes. I take it every year just to see. This year I was going to pass. Will's face went pale. And now I'm going to pass it. Become a lawyer. My first case is going to be suing you for fraud and emotional distress. Sarah squeezed my hand. Good luck with that, will said, but his voice cracked. No, mom said. Standing up. Good luck finding another family. She walked out. Dad followed without looking back. Will grabbed his jacket, looked at me one more time. You can't prove anything. Maybe not, I said. But they know. Everyone knows now.

Truth or lie? His truth made my parents walk out and never look at him the same again. We were playing two truths and a lie. Just family. Mom, dad, my wife Sarah, my sister Jen and will. It was supposed to be fun. Will was on his third beer. That cocky grin plastered on his face. Alright, my turn. Here's a good one. He leaned back in his chair. One, I got promoted to senior partner last week. 2. I'm moving to Seattle next month. 3, I paid someone to sabotage your bar exam. Everyone laughed. Classic will, always trying to be the center of attention. Will be serious, mom said, shuffling cards. But he wasn't laughing anymore. He was staring right at me. The lie is Seattle. I'm not going anywhere. The room went quiet. What? I said, your bar exam. He continued, casual as anything. Remember how you failed it three times? Couldn't figure out why you kept choking. Sarah's hand found mine under the table. Will, that's not funny. It's not a joke. He pulled out his phone, scrolling through old emails. Cost me 15 grand total. Total. But man, it was worth it. My chest felt tight. You're lying, am I? He turned his phone toward me. Email chains, names, dates, your second Proctor, Michael Chen. Gambling debts. I paid him to Mark your essays. Wrong. Third time. Different guy. Same Problem. Needed money for his sick head. Here to the screen. The dates matched. Everything matched. You failed the bar three times, will said. Started doubting yourself, went into teaching instead. I watched you give up on being a lawyer. Five years. Five years of thinking I wasn't smart enough. Of watching my law school friends succeed while I taught high school civics. Of Sarah telling me it was okay, that teaching was noble while I died inside. Every day. Mom's wine glass slipped from her hand and shattered on the floor. Nobody moved to clean it. Why I finally managed, will shrugged. You were always the golden child. Perfect grades, perfect wife, mom and Dad's favorite. I just wanted to see you fail at something. $15,000, Dad said quietly, to destroy your.

I needed soup. Anyway, I followed her there, too. Tyler was starting to calm down a little, but then got a second wind when I wouldn't give him my phone. The crying got even louder. This lady kept looking back at me with this horrified expression, every single aisle she went to. I went to dairy section, suddenly needed milk and yogurt, pasta aisle, time to stock up on spaghetti. Cleaning supplies, better grab some dish soap. I stayed about 5 feet behind her the whole time, housing shelves, comparing prices, acting totally normal except for my screaming kid in the cart. Other shoppers started noticing. One younger guy actually grinned at me when he figured out what I was doing. An older man gave me a thumbs up. But this lady was getting more and more frustrated. She'd speed up, I'd speed up. She'd backtrack to an aisle we'd already been down, so would I. After about 15 minutes of this, she only had like four items in her basket. He looked at me one more time and I just smiled at her while Tyler screamed about wanting goldfish crackers. She turned around, marched straight to the checkout with her half done shopping and I watched her leave the store. Tyler actually calmed down right after she left like he knew the mission was complete. I finished my entire shopping list in peace, got everything I needed, even remembered the milk I'd actually run out of at checkout. The teenage cashier was trying not to laugh. Did you really just follow that lady around the whole store? She asked quietly. I shrugged. She had opinions about my parenting, figured she should experience it up close. When I got to the car, I felt better than I had an.

So this happened when my son, Tyler, was about 2. He's seven now and doing great. But back then, we didn't know he had autism yet. We just thought he was going through a really tough phase. Free trip to the store was a gamble. Some days he'd be fine. Other days, it was a complete meltdown over nothing. This particular Tuesday, I'd been up since 5 because Tyler had a bad night. My husband was out of town for work. I had exactly one hour between Tyler's morning nap and when I had to pick up my daughter from preschool. I needed groceries desperately. We were down to cereal crumbs and ketchup packets. We got to the store, and everything was okay for maybe 10 minutes. Then we passed the toy aisle. Tyler saw this blue truck on the shelf and lost his mind. He started screaming and reaching for it. I tried explaining we couldn't get it today. I tried distracting him with his favorite snack. Nothing worked. He was full on sobbing. That kind of cry where kids can barely breathe. I'm pushing the cart through the produce section, trying to grab apples with one hand while patting Tyler's back with the other. I'm exhausted. I probably look like a mess. My hair is in a greasy ponytail, and I'm wearing the same shirt from yesterday. Other shoppers are Giving me sympathetic looks or just avoiding eye contact completely. I get it. Nobody wants to be near a screaming toddler. Then this older woman walks past us. She's got perfect silver hair and designer sunglasses pushed up on her head. She looks at Tyler, then at me, and says, loud enough for half the produce section to hear, some people really shouldn't bring children out in public if they can't control them. I just froze. Tyler's still crying. This woman is shaking her head at me like I'm the worst parent alive. And something inside me just snapped. Instead of yelling back or crying or leaving the store, I decided to make her shopping trip as uncomfortable as mine. She headed toward the bread aisle. Suddenly, I needed bread, too. I pushed my cart right behind her, Tyler still wailing away. She picked up whole wheat. I stood three feet away, examining the ingredient list on rye bread. She moved to check prices. I moved with her. She gave me this look and moved to the next aisle. Canned good.

One of them, Brittany, said, does she even know what those are for my father in law. Victor leaned back in his leather chair, drink in hand. Well, at least she'll be useful, more than we can say for her father. The room erupted. Aunts, uncles, everyone laughing. Mia's face went blank, that dead expression kids get when adults break something fundamental inside them. She carefully put the gloves back in the box, close the lid, didn't cry. That was worse. I stood up. Mia, get your coat. We're leaving. Diane, touch my arm. Oh, come on. It's a joke. Where's your sense of humor? We were going to give her a real gift later. I pulled away. Mia, go wait in the car now. She left without the ornaments she'd made. The second the door closed, I walked to their tree, unplugged it. The lights went dark. I grabbed the trunk and started dragging it toward the front door. Ornaments shattering against the hardwood, glass everywhere. What the hell are you doing? Victor stood up, spilling his drink. I didn't answer, just kept pulling. Got the tree outside, hoisted it into my truck bed, went back inside. You're insane, Diane shrieked. Those ornaments are vintage. I started grabbing presents, armfuls of them. Theirs, not ours. Mia got cleaning supplies, remember? Designer bags, electronics, jewelry boxes. Four trips, loaded everything while they screamed from the porch. Too shocked to physically stop me, Victor threatened To call the police. You're stealing. I looked at him. Call them. Explain why you gave my daughter cleaning supplies for Christmas while her cousins got ipads. I'm sure that'll go great. 5th trip. I took their outdoor decorations, the expensive ones, lit reindeer projection lights, the inflatable Santa. We drove to the children's hospital. Mia hadn't said a word. I asked the front desk for pediatrics. The nurse's eyes went wide when she saw my truck. Is all this the kids, whatever they need, whoever needs it most? She started crying, called other nurses. They unloaded everything while sick kids watched from windows. Mia finally spoke. Those kids needed it more than they did. Three days later, Diane left a voicemail, said I'd embarrass the family, that I owed them $8,000 for the destroyed decorations. I never called back. Haven't spoken to them since. Spoken to.

The room burst into laughter. Twenty minutes later, the tree, the lights and every one of her presents were gone. Just like us, I married into money. My wife Natalie died when our daughter Mia was 3, cancer. Her family blamed me for not catching it sooner. Like I'm a doctor, said I distracted her from treatment with my negativity. For five years, I raised Mia alone. I'm a high school teacher. We lived in a two bedroom apartment. Her grandmother would send birthday cards, empty ones, teaching her not to expect handouts. Meanwhile, her cousins got cars at 16, Europe trips at 14, college, funds that could buy houses. My father in law, Victor, owns a chain of car dealerships, made his money in the 80s, never stopped reminding people. My stepmother in law Diane married him for the money, then decided she'd earned it through suffering. They never visited, never called. When Mia asked why grandma didn't love her like other grandmas, I didn't have an answer. Last December, they invited us for the first time. Mia made them ornaments in art class, picture frames with our family photos inside. She wrapped them in newspaper because we couldn't afford fancy paper. She was so excited she couldn't sleep the night before. Maybe they just needed time to miss us. Dad, I should have said no, should have protected her. But I Wanted to believe people could change? Christmas morning, their house looked like a department store exploded. A 12 foot tree, professionally decorated, presents stacked three feet high. Mia's three cousins, Diane's kids from her first marriage, tearing through mountains of gifts, ipads, designer clothes, concert tickets, jewelry. Mia sat on the floor in her target dress watching, trying to figure out which present might be hers. Thirty minutes passed. Every cousin had opened everything. Finally, Diane walked over with a wrapped box. Almost forgot. This one's for Mia. Mia's face lit up. She carefully peeled the paper, trying not to rip it. Inside, dish soap, sponges, rubber gloves and a scrub brush, the kind with the yellow bristles. Diane smiled. Women's work starts early in this family. Better learn young.

Of crying with her. Of being present. What do you have, Frank? Proof that you're tough. Three sons who can't stand to be in the same room as you. Sarah started crying softly. Michael stared at his father, something unspoken passing between them. Frank grabbed his jacket. I'm leaving. No one stopped him. The door slammed. Silence. Then my aunt Sarah spoke, her voice breaking. He hasn't cried since his mother died 40 years ago. He was 19. His father told him to man up at the funeral. I think he's been trying to prove he could ever since. My mother reached across the table, squeezed my hand. Lisa would be proud of you. I nodded, tears falling freely. Now. Real men don't cry. Frank's words echoed in my head. But looking around the table at my family finally breathing, finally real with each other, I realized something. Real men do cry. They grieve, they hurt. They love openly. They show up. What they don't do is die alone, emotionally bankrupt, wondering why their children don't visit. Frank never apologized, never came back. But two weeks later, his youngest son called me. I heard what happened at Thanksgiving. Thank you. For what? For saying what we never could. He's been impossible our whole lives. I paused. It's not too late, you know, for you to talk to him. I know, he said quietly. But I don't think I can. Not while he's still that Person. Christmas came. Frank and Sarah's house was quiet. Just the two of them. My mother said Sarah invited them to join us, but Frank refused. Too proud, too stubborn. Too afraid to face what I'd exposed. Meanwhile, I hosted dinner. Michael came, brought his kids. Sarah came too. Without Frank. We talked. We laughed. We cried when someone mentioned Lisa's pumpkin pie. And it was real. Messy and painful and beautiful and real. That night, as everyone left, Michael pulled me aside. I called my dad yesterday. Told him I'd visit if he. Just talk. Really talk. No lectures, no toughness. Just honesty. He hung up on me. I'm sorry. Don't be. Michael said you were right. He chose this. He chose toughness over connection, pride over love. And now he's got exactly what he built. An empty house and a reputation. I think about Frank sometimes. About how terrified he must be of his own emotions. How exhausting it must be to perform strength every moment of every day. But mostly I think about Lisa. About how she taught me that crying isn't weakness. It's proof you love something enough to hurt when it's gone. Real men don't cry. No. Real men do. And they're stronger for it.

Then he laughed when I teared up talking about my late wife. So I asked him one question that made the whole table turn against him. Real men don't cry. My uncle Frank said it loud enough for everyone to hear. I've been talking about Lisa, my wife, how she used to make pumpkin pie from scratch every Thanksgiving, how this was the first one without her, six months since cancer took her. My voice cracked, my eyes watered, and Frank laughed. Oh, come on, you're gonna cry at the dinner table. Real men don't cry. My aunt looked uncomfortable. My cousins went quiet. My mother opened her mouth, then closed it. Frank just sat there, chest puffed out, like he'd said something profound. He'd always been this way, the tough guy, the ex Marine who never let anyone forget it. Emotions were weakness. Vulnerability was failure. He'd raised his sons with an iron fist and wondered why they never called. I wiped my eyes, took a breath. I said calmly, when's the last time one of your boys visited you? His smile faltered. What your sons? When did you last see them? The table went silent. Frank shifted in his seat. They're busy work families. Christmas, maybe, I continued. Was it Christmas or has it been longer? Frank's jaw tightened. That's none of your business. You're right, I said, but I'm curious. You've spent 30 years teaching them that. Real men don't show emotion. That crying is weakness, that vulnerability is failure. So I'm wondering, did it work? Are they strong men now? My Aunt Sarah's eyes dropped to her plate. My cousin Michael looked away. Everyone knew Frank's oldest son hadn't spoken to him in four years. The middle one called twice a year out of obligation. The youngest moved to Seattle and blamed work for never visiting. Frank's face reddened. You don't know what you're talking about. I do, actually. Lisa knew, too. Before she died, she told me something. She said, the strongest thing I ever did was cry with her, hold her hand and let her see my fear. She said it made her feel less alone. Frank scoffed. That different how I leaned forward. How is it different, Frank? She was dying. I was terrified. I cried. Does that make me weak or does it make me human? Because right now I'm wondering what makes someone so afraid of feelings that they mock a widower at Thanksgiving dinner? My mother finally spoke. Frank, that's enough. He's grieving. Frank stood abruptly. I don't have to sit here and be lectured. You don't. I agreed. Before you go, answer me this. When you're alone at night, when Sarah is asleep and it's just you and your thoughts, do you ever wonder why your sons don't call? Do you ever think maybe it's because they Learned from you that showing love is weakness, that needing someone is Failure. The room was frozen. Frank's hands trembled. You have no right. I have every right, I said quietly. I lost my wife, the woman I loved more than anything. And you know what? I have memory.

He just stood there staring at her. I had to push past him to roll Jenna onto her side so she wouldn't choke. I'm trying to dial 9 1 1 on my phone with one hand while using my other arm to block the kids from climbing on their unconscious mother. I finally got all four girls out of the bathroom and shut the door. Kyle started pacing in circles in the hallway. Every 20 seconds, he'd knock on the bathroom door asking me stupid questions. Can you call our nanny? Can you go to the hospital with her? Did you start the dishwasher? Does the baby sippy cup need to be hand washed? The paramedics showed up and got Jenna on a stretcher. She woke up while they were checking her vitals, and Kyle immediately started asking her questions. What time do the kids go to bed? Did you wash their pajamas? Did they get screen time today or can I put on a movie? Which stuffed animals do they sleep with? What stories do they like? What setting is the sound machine supposed to be on? Do they want whole milk or 2%? His wife was lying on a stretcher about to be taken to the emergency room, and he's asking about milk preferences. I told him his wife couldn't hold his hand right now and he needed to figure it out himself. He got all defensive and said he's not Usually the one who deals with bedtime. And he's trying his best. Then he asked what temperature the girls like their bath water. That's when I lost it. I told him to figure it out on his own and called him a useless piece of shit. He looked at me like I'd slapped him. The paramedics took Jenna to the ambulance, and I stayed with the kids while Kyle went to the hospital. It's been almost a month now. Jenna's fine. It was a bad infection. But every time I come over to their house, Kyle won't even look at me. He leaves the room when I walk in.

I kissed her forehead and told her to stay with her dad. Then I screenshot every single message, printed all six pages and drove to Staples to get them bound. The next morning, I walked into Principal Monroe's office before school started. I didn't make an appointment. I slammed the bound messages on her desk and said either you address this or Channel 7 News will. She started reading and her face went from annoyed to horrified. She looked up at me and said, this is completely unacceptable. I told her I wanted an emergency parent meeting that evening, mandatory. She tried to say she needed time to plan, but I wasn't leaving until she agreed. She sent the email while I stood there watching. That evening, the school cafeteria was packed. All 22 families showed up confused about why they were summoned. Their kids sat next to them. Principal Monroe introduced me and I walked to the front. My hands were shaking but my voice was steady. I read every single message out loud word for word. When I got to the garbage collector comments, I look directly at the mom who wrote them. Her face went bright red. Her daughter started crying. When I read the messages about Hazel's jacket and us renting, several kids looked confused and hurt. The room was completely silent except for my voice. When I finished, I said my husband keeps the city clean. He works harder than most people in this Room. And my daughter is the kindest, smartest kid I know. She deserved better than this. I sat down for 10 seconds. Nobody moved. Then Hazel's teacher, Missus Laura, stood up and started clapping. Slowly, other parents joined in. Not the group chat parents. They sat frozen. But at least a dozen families stood up applauding. After the meeting, a dad I'd never spoke can you came up to me. He had tears in his eyes. He said, my brother is a garbage collector in Phoenix. I'm ashamed I didn't speak up sooner. When I heard the whispers, another mom hugged me and said, we're having a pool party Saturday. Hazel is invited and so are you. Three days later, Hazel came home from school with five birthday cards from kids who hadn't been able to make it but felt terrible. The following Saturday, she went to that pool party. When I picked her up, she was soaking wet and smiling, bigger than I'd seen in months. The mean moms, their kids switched schools by winter break. Turns out nobody wanted to be friends with bullies.

I'm serious. She's not moving. Dad shook his head. We're not falling for another one of your tricks to get us to open the door. I just grabbed my phone and called 9 1 1 myself, hands shaking as I gave them the address. But as I was explaining who Missus Lane was, I saw black smoke starting to curl up from her stove, kettle, the gas flame. The smoke thickened, pooling against her ceiling, spreading through her kitchen. I knew that if Missus Lane started to choke, then the ambulance might not make it in time, so I had no time left to argue with my parents. I moved and triggered everything at once, slamming my body against the door, jumping in front of every sensor, creating absolute chaos. Alarms shrieked from every direction, the app probably exploding with notifications. There's a fire! I screamed over the noise. Mom was shouting at dad to find the system reset code, dad yelling he couldn't remember it, both fumbling with their phones. Smoke was pouring from Missus Lane's kitchen window now. I grabbed my metal desk lamp, eddied its heavy base solid in my hands, and started slamming it against the reinforced glass. Nothing. So I did it again. The frame started to splinter again. A crack appeared again and again and again, until the frame buckled and the glass hung loose. My parents burst in just as I was forcing my body through the jagged opening. Sophie, Stop! Mom lunged forward, then froze. Seeing the smoke billowing from next door, I hit the ground, running barefoot on wet grass, shoulder bleeding. Missus Lane's door was locked. I grabbed her garden gnome and shattered her kitchen window. The smoke poured out, black and choking. She was so light when I dragged her out, unconscious but breathing. Just as sirens filled the air. The fire captain stood in our living room, and hour later, his boots leaving ash prints on Mom's cream carpet. Three more minutes and the smoke inhalation would have been fatal. Your daughter saved that woman's life. He looked at my bandaged shoulder, then at my parents. So I've got to ask, why did she have to break through a reinforced window to get out of her room? Mom's face was pale, dad staring at the floor. The motion sensors came down that night.

Her husband, Kyle is one of those dads who looks great at birthday parties and soccer games when Jenna is standing right there. But the second she leaves him alone with all four kids, he completely shuts down. Like his brain stops working. Three weeks ago, Jenna got really sick. I brought over lasagna from Costco and garlic bread. We. We're all sitting at the dinner table eating when Jenna suddenly got up and rushed to the bathroom. The three year old jumped off her chair and ran after her mom. Then she came sprinting back, yelling that Mommy was throwing up in the toilet. All four girls bolted toward the bathroom. Kyle and I followed them. I got in there, and Jenna was hunched over the toilet looking absolutely terrible. Her face was gray and she was shaking. I grabbed a washcloth and helped her wipe her mouth, while Kyle just stood in the doorway doing nothing. I told him to go get her nausea medicine and a thermometer. He finally left, and I got Jenna sitting on the floor against the bathtub. When Kyle came back, I told him to take the kids out of the bathroom so she could breathe. He took them to the hallway. I put the thermometer in Jenna's mouth, and it read 103.8 degrees. I went to get Tylenol and water from the kitchen. When I walked back to the bathroom not even two minutes later, all four kids were crowded around their mom again because Kyle couldn't keep them in the hallway. I handed Jenna the pills and water. She swallowed them and immediately started throwing up again. Then her eyes rolled back and she passed out cold.

I spent three weeks planning Hazel's 10th birthday party. She'd finally made friends after we moved to this neighborhood six months ago, or so I thought. We decorated the entire backyard with streamers, set up a dessert table, rented a bounce house and even hired a face painter. Hazel had been so excited she could barely sleep the night before. She picked out goody bags for each kid herself, little soccer balls since her class was obsessed with the World Cup. The party was supposed to start at 1 war PM by 1:30, nobody had arrived. Hazel kept running to the front window saying, maybe they're just running late, mom. By 2:00, she came inside crying so hard she could barely breathe. She'd invited 22 kids from her fourth grade class. Not a single one showed up. I held her while she sobbed into my shoulder, asking over and over, what did I do wrong? I had no answer. My phone buzzed with a text notification. It was from a group chat called Missus Sanders's class parents that I didn't remember joining. Confused, I opened it. My stomach dropped. The messages went back 3 days. Is anyone actually going to Hazel's party? One mom wrote. Absolutely not. Another reply, why would we, someone else asked. Then came the message that made my hands shake. Her dad is a garbage collector. I don't want Skyler Around that. Imagine the smell they must have at home. The replies got worse. Trash can emojis, laughing faces. One mom wrote, I heard they rent, not own. Probably can't even afford this neighborhood. Another said, Hazel's always wearing the same jacket. So embarrassing. I couldn't believe what I was reading. These were educated adults, lawyers, doctors, real estate agents talking about a 10 year old child like us. My husband Adam worked six the hour weeks as a sanitation worker starting at 4:00am in the blazing summer heat and freezing winter cold. He did it so we could afford our house in their precious neighborhood, so Hazel could go to a good school, so we could give her opportunities. While I was reading, Hazel whispered from the couch, mom, did I do something wrong? Are they not coming because of me? That shattered me.

I own a restaurant that does catering on the side. Started it five years ago after culinary school. Built it up from nothing. Jake married my sister Rita when I was still washing dishes for minimum wage. Never supported the business. Called it a hobby that would fail. First year I was open, he showed up with 12 friends on a Friday night. No reservation, demanded the best table. Ordered everything expensive. Sent half back claiming problems that didn't exist. Bill came to $800. Family discount, right? He said I gave him 10% off. He complained to Rita that I was stingy. When I catered my cousin's baby shower, Jake ate three plates of food, then told everyone the seasoning was off. Still took home leftovers. Rida's birthday, I made a five course meal at their house. Jake critiqued every dish to his friends while eating seconds. Never said thank you. Never offered to pay for ingredients. When I won a regional cooking competition, Jake told people it was probably rigged because a judge knew Rida. The restaurant review in the paper called us the best new spot in town. Must be a slow news day, he said. But when his boss needed catering, suddenly I was the best chef in the family and he needed a favor. Did it at a cost because Rida begged. Jake took credit for Discovering me, his friends started calling for discounts. Jake said, you hook us up. I started saying no. Jake told Rita I was getting too big for my britches, forgetting where I came from. Where I came from was working three jobs to afford culinary school. The engagement announcement was at my parents house. Jake stood up during dessert. We've set the date for next June. And of course Alex will be doing the food as our gift. Everyone looked at me. I hadn't been asked. Rita looks surprised too. We haven't discussed this, I said. What's to discuss? You cater weddings. We're having a wedding for 200 people. That's a 15 thousand dollar job minimum. Exactly why we need family to help. Weddings are expensive. His parents chimed in. They were paying for everything else. Surely I could contribute this. Jake had already told everyone at their country club that his brother in law was handling the food. It would be embarrassing to change now. His mother said. I asked, what

My sister in law Kelly had her first miscarriage about six months ago. It was devastating. I get that. The whole family rallied around her and my brother Jake, bringing casseroles and giving them space to. But then she started acting like she was the only person who'd ever lost a baby. It started small. At family dinners, she'd make comments about how nobody understood what real loss felt like. When my cousin Amanda talked about her dog dying, Kelly rolled her eyes and said that's not the same thing at all. When my mom mentioned missing my grandpa who died last year, Kelly literally scoffed and said, you got to say goodbye to him. Though the worst part was how she treated me. I've been married to my husband Chris for 8 years and we don't have kids yet. Kelly started making these passive aggressive comments about how lucky I was to not have to worry about these things, how I couldn't possibly understand what she was going through. Last weekend was my nephew's birthday party. Kelly seemed okay during most of it, playing with the kids and laughing at their jokes. But then my brother's friend brought up how his wife was pregnant and Kelly's whole mood shifted. She got quiet and started picking out her food. Later when we were in the kitchen cleaning up, Kelly started talking. About how hard it was seeing pregnant women everywhere. I tried to be supportive, telling her I understood how triggering that must be. That's when she snapped. No, you don't understand, she said, her voice getting louder. You have no idea what it's like to lose a baby. You've never even been pregnant. You don't know what real loss feels like. Something inside me just broke. I've been holding this in for years, keeping it private because Chris and I decided we didn't want the whole family knowing our business. But I was so tired of her acting like she had a monopoly on grief. Actually, Kelly, I said, my voice shaking, I've had four miscarriages. The kitchen went dead silent. My mom dropped the plate she was holding. Kelly's face went completely white. The first one was three years ago. I can continued. I was 12 weeks along. We thought we were safe to tell people, but then I started bleeding at work. Chris had to pick me up from the bathroom floor. Kelly tried to say something, but I kept going. The second one was a year later. Only eight weeks that time, but it didn't hurt any less. The third one was right before Christmas Last year. I spent New Year's Eve in the hospital. The fourth one was two months ago.

I raised my hand as a joke. I helped my mom watch YouTube videos when she was pregnant with my brother. Does that count? The class laughed and I smiled, proud of my quick thinking. But Mister Gonzales wasn't smiling. His face had gone completely white, and his hands were shaking as he gripped the edge of his desk. Good. Come with me now. The entire classroom went silent. In South Dallas when a teacher used that tone. You didn't ask questions? Everyone stay in your seats. Do not leave this room. If I'm not back in 20 minutes, have someone call 9 1 1. He was already pulling me toward the door. And that's when I noticed the dark stain on his sleeve. To wet. It looked like blood. Mr. Gonzales, what's happening? Is someone hurt? I tried to pull my arm free, but his grip was iron tight. I don't think I'm qualified for whatever. You're the only one who raised their hand. He cut me off. That makes you qualified. Outside, his car was already running with the doors open. She said she had until Thursday. He kept muttering while speeding out of the school parking lot. The midwife isn't answering her phone. I the door handle, calculating if I could jump out at the next red light. Mr. Gonzalez, you're scaring me. Should I call my mom? No. He swerved. Around a car, and I slammed into the window. No one can know. Put your phone away. Turn it off! I'm not turning off my phone! I shouted. But I did anyway. We were going 50 in a 25 zone, Gonzalez kept checking his mirrors like someone was following us. Finally, he pulled into a driveway of a small yellow house that definitely wasn't his. Listen to me. He grabbed my shoulders before we got out. They can't know she was here. Do you understand? No matter what happens, they can't know. I don't understand anything! I was practically yelling now. I'm 17. I don't even have my license yet. Marco. He used my name for the first time, his voice desperate. You've kept bigger secrets than this. I know your family. I need that same silence now. He wasn't wrong. I'd already seen two drive bys this year and never said a word to the cops. But this felt different. He shoved a pair of surgical gloves into my hands. Put these on. The front door was unlocked. Inside, we followed the sound of crying to a back bedroom where a woman was curled up on a bare mattress. She looked young, maybe early 20s, with long black hair stuck to her face with sweat. It's too early, she gasped in accented English when she saw us. Then she looked at me and started crying harder. He's just a child. You brought a child? I'm 17. I Said stupid like that made any difference. I watch Grey's anatomy, if that helps. She switched to Spanish and started begging Mister Gonzalez for something I couldn't understand. He pushed me toward her. Check how dilated she is. What? I backed up so fast I knocked over.

I'm a court stenographer and last month I witnessed the most savage 16 year old absolutely destroy everyone in juvenile court. Meet Tyler. He got arrested for spray painting math is stupid on his high school. Officer Johnson is presenting the case. Your honor, the defendant was caught red handed vandalizing school property with anti educational graffiti. Tyler raises his hand. Objection. Judge Williams looks confused. You're not a lawyer, you can't object. But your honor, Officer Johnson said I was carted handed but I was actually caught blue handed because I was using blue spray paint. That's false testimony. The entire courtroom goes silent. Officer Johnson's eyes starts twitching. Tyler, that's not how objections work then how do they work? Because nobody explained the rules and I, I don't want to accidentally break more laws. Officer Johnson continues, the defendant caused $200 in property damage and showed no remorse when arrested. Tyler raises his hand again. That's also incorrect, your honor. What now? I showed plenty of remorse. I said sorry when Officer John tackled me. I also said ow and get off me, you're heavy, which shows genuine emotion. Officer Johnson jumps in. You also said this is stupid and math still sucks. Those were factual observations not related to my remorse level. Judge Williams is trying not to smile. Tyler, why did you write math is stupid on your school? Because it's true, your honor. Math is objectively Stupid. That's your opinion? No, sir. It's science. Why do we need to find X? X doesn't want to be found. X is probably in witness Protection for a reason. The prosecutor tries to jump in. Your honor, the defendant is being disrespectful to education. Tyler turns to the prosecutor. Ma'am, education is being disrespectful to my brain cells. They're making me learn about imaginary numbers. If they're imaginary, why can't I just imagine I passed the test? Judge Williams asked Tyler, do you understand why vandalism is wrong? Yes, sir. It's wrong because I got caught. If I hadn't gotten caught, it would just be mysterious street art and people would call me Banksy junior. It's not art. It's vandalism. Your honor, that's discrimination against my artistic vision. Michael?

She still thinks she's learning how to flirt. Trish started working at my waitressing job five months ago and from the moment she saw my boyfriend Kayo, she set her eyes on him like he was the last Infinity Stone. He was half Japanese like me, meaning we related on a deep level. And for some reason, Trish hated this the most. The first time she saw us having lunch, she made herself comfortable in my seat next to his. When I got up to use the bathroom, she pressed her hips against his and flashed a flirty smile before saying konichiwa. When he awkwardly set it back, she grabbed a pair of chopsticks and started eating noodles unsuccessfully complaining about whitewashed girls appropriating his beautiful culture, very obviously referring to me. When I came back from the bathroom, she told to grab a chair, telling me I was welcome to join in on their conversation. It definitely struck a nerve but I was so secure in Kaido and I's relationship, I didn't even mind until Trish started trying to implode us. She cornered him when I wasn't looking and tell him innuendo style phrases in Japanese that she got off Google translate. Whenever we were talking, she'd always squeeze past us very slowly, sometimes making sure to rub her behind against Kaido and other times facing him directly and giving him the effing eyes, the Thing that really made me mad was when she asked Kaido to come teach her Japanese at her house after work. I was going to confront her there and then, but we were in the middle of a very busy service and I told myself I'd do it right after. Big mistake. You see, at some point during service, these important Japanese business then came in for food. They were at my section, but Trish practically shoved me aside to serve them. Please speak Japanese. I understand everything, she told them. They looked pleasantly surprised and started rattling off their order with specific modifications and allergies. Trish just kept saying, hi, hi, while scribbling nonsense. 45 minutes later, it was chaos. One guy got served the wrong starter. Another received two sushi orders instead of his chicken chow Mein. And the third guy actually started having an allergic reaction to shellfish, which he asked to exclude. That's when Trish did it. While Kaido ran to get the Epipen, she pointed at me and told her cousin, who is the manager, that I changed the order to sabotage her. And without verifying anything, her cousin wrote me up on the spot in front of everyone. One more incident and you're terminated. I went home crushed and just cried to Kaido. I was wondering.

After I caught her texting her ex. I didn't say a word, just walked to the bedroom and started packing. She kept laughing from the couch. You're being dramatic, Michael. It's just texting. I pulled out my laptop, opened my banking app and started clicking. Her laughter died when she heard the notification sounds. What are you doing? Still silent. Removed her from my car insurance, canceled her phone plan that I paid for. Click. Change the Netflix password she used daily. Michael, stop. This isn't funny anymore. But I wasn't done. Logged into our shared Spotify account, change the password. Then Amazon Prime, then Hulu, then Disney plus. Every single subscription she used but never paid for. Even changed the Wi-Fi password on our router. Are you seriously going through every account right now? Next, I opened my credit card app, removed her as an authorized user. Then my gym membership, cancelled her guest privileges. My Costco card revoked her access. This is insane. You're being psychotic. I grabbed my suitcase and headed for the door. She jumped up. Panic setting in. Wait, where are you going? You can't just leave. Finally spoke. You asked what I was going to do. I'm showing you. My phone buzzed. Uber outside. Michael, I'm sorry. It meant nothing. Then, neither does this. I walked out. The Uber driver was cool, helped me load my stuff without asking Questions. We drove away. I saw her standing in the doorway still holding her dead phone, realizing she couldn't even connect to Wi Fi to call for help. 20 minutes later, my phone exploded. Her number was already disconnected since I'd cancelled the plan. But her friends started texting me. She's crying at Starbucks because she can't call an Uber without her phone plan. She tried to drive home but remembered you took her off insurance. He's asking everyone for Netflix passwords because she was watching a show. She went to the gym and they wouldn't let her in. Then came the really good stuff. Her sister called me. Michael, what did you do? Madison's at my place having a complete meltdown. I did exactly what she suggested. She says you cut off everything, her phone, insurance, streaming accounts, gym access. That's petty. Petty is texting your ex behind your boyfriend's back for two months. Two months, she said it just started. I sent her sister a screenshot of the oldest text I'd found from March. It was now may. Oh, my God, Michael, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. Her sister called back an hour later. She's been lying to everyone. I read through more of those texts. She was planning to leave you, I know, right after her ex said he wasn't ready for a relationship. So you were her backup plan. Exactly. Keep me around for bills while pursuing him emotionally. The next day I got A call from an unknown number. Madison using her mom's phone. Michael, please, I.

Our lead just got into an accident. The show started in less than an hour. At first I laughed. I thought it was some kind of cruel theater joke. I was just the prop guy, the one who taped broken swords, filled fake goblets, and made sure nobody tripped over stray cables. The closest I'd ever come to acting was whispering lines along with the cast from the wings. But the director wasn't joking. You've heard Mason's lines a hundred times, he said. You can do this. We open in 50 minutes. I don't even have a costume, I muttered. You do now, he said, tossing me a velvet tunic before rushing off. In the dressing room, my reflection looked like a parody of a king. With my collar crooked, sleeves too long, eyes too wide, my stomach churned. Laura, the lead actress, stormed in. You're serious? You're him tonight? Apparently. She exhaled through her nose somewhere between pity and disbelief. Alright, don't freeze. Just follow my lead. That was everyone's advice. Don't freeze. As if it were that simple. The first act was a disaster. I tripped over the hem of my robe, missed my cue, and called one of the Lords by the wrong name. The audience laughed. Not cruelly, but that made it worse. Laughter meant they knew I wasn't supposed to be there. By Act two, I'd Sweated through my costume. Lines slipped from my mind. The lights were too hot, the stage too wide, and every eye felt like a magnifying glass during a brief blackout. Laura hissed at me, get it together! You're tanking the show! I'm trying, I whispered. But the truth was, I wasn't sure I belonged anywhere near that stage. By the time Act 3 began, the play was dying a slow and painful death. Due to my lack of talent. The audience's polite smiles had turned into awkward silence. I could feel the director's glare drilling through me from the wings. Then came the big confrontation scene, which was the heart of the show. Mason used to deliver it like thunder. His voice would fill the theater. But I didn't have

My phone rang as I crossed the Oklahoma border, tears rushing down my cold cheeks. I wipe the tears from my eyes, being careful of my black eye before pressing the green answer button on my Bluetooth. Hello, I asked Sierra. Mom's cold voice came through the car speakers loud and clear. What's this I hear from your husband? You left him for another guy? I froze in my seat, my hands trembling on the steering wheel. I spotted a rest stop up ahead and pulling into the parking lot. Sitting back in my seat with a sigh. That's what he told you, I asked quietly. I didn't leave him for another guy. Of course you did. Why else would you leave such a wonderful man like him? I snorted at her words. A wonderful man like him, I repeated. Tell that to my black eye. She paused and silence fell for a long moment.

I had burned dinner that he forced me to cook for him and he thought I did it on purpose, calling me lazy and stupid. Then he slapped me across the face. I told myself I would Leave him then. But he came back and apologized, giving me flowers and promising to never do that again. The next week, he broke my arm by shoving me down the stairs once again. He felt so bad about it and doted on me lovingly for weeks during my recovery. A few months later, I had forgotten to give him a message from his boss and he ended up losing his job because he. I missed an extra day of work. He beat me almost half to death because of that one. But every time he hurt me, I would tell myself to leave. But each time he would confuse me with dates and flowers and expensive things. He would love me like I wanted to be loved. But this time he went too far. He threatened to kill me. And there was something in his eyes that made me believe him. So I ran. I shook my head to clear it. Mom, he beats me all the time. I explained I had to get away to save my life. Mom, Scott, come home. Sierra.

When I was 10, my mom marched onto the playground and pushed a kid off a swing after he cut in line and took my spot. She later grabbed his arm while he sobbed and made him apologize in front of everyone. And I just stood there watching. I mean, I thought it was normal. Mom had always been involved, but around middle school, I quickly figured out that the things she did were a little more extreme. That day, I came home with a bee on a science project she had helped me with. She was furious. She called my teacher and spent 40 minutes arguing until my teacher gave up and turned it into an A just to get her off the phone. High school was even worse. She completely edited a college application essay that one of my teachers said was already perfect and ended up getting me waitlisted. And it wasn't just school, either. When my mom found out I had a crush on a boy, she found his parents on social media and asked them to set up a date. They were instant. He creeped out and tried to politely tell her no, but that was a mistake. You see, no was the word she hated the most. She stretched her fingers and took a deep, angry breath before proceeding to hurl insults into their chat until they had no choice but To block her, just to make her stop. Rumour about my crazy mom took over the entire school and for the rest of the year people were scared to even talk to me, even my friends. But now that I graduated college and started job hunting like a real adult, I thought maybe she'd cool down and give me space. But I was so wrong. She found my resume on my laptop and changed everything. She bragged about herself in the reference section, added skills and experiences I didn't have. Even replaced the email and phone number to hers. I only found out when one company emailed her instead of me. When I confronted her, she said I was just polishing it, but some of the things she had edited actually made me sound like a terrible person instead. The worst part was when she started harassing the HR departments of the company. If I'd applied to one. Recruiter actually told me during a phone screen that my mother had called twice that week. I didn't get a second interview. She scared off two internship opportunities the same way. Calling supervisors to follow up on my behalf, sending additional materials they didn't ask for. Basically hovering so aggressively that they assumed I couldn't function independently. I begged her to stop, but called me ungrateful. I just felt bad knowing that. Nobody wants you, she told me. But she backed away after that and actually let me do things on my Own. And finally I got an interview for my dream position. The salary was great, the benefits were even better, and there was

Then she hung up. I pulled my car back onto the highway and drove the rest of the way to my parents house. I froze when I saw my husband's car in the driveway. How did he get here so fast and why was he here? My legs shook as I got out of the car and headed up to the porch. Mom opened the door and ushered me inside. Ignoring my red face and black eye, I avoided eye contact with my husband when I entered the living room to find my entire family sitting there. The only family member I actually tolerated was my oldest brother who was a cop. He sat in the recliner by the fireplace and frowned when he saw my face, glancing at my husband with a raised eyebrow. Do you want to tell us why you left him for another man? Dad asked gruffly. I glanced around the room and realized that my family have already made up their minds to believe my husband. They didn't really care about the truth. That was when I knew what I had to do. I pulled out my phone that held all the evidence my husband abused me throughout our relationship, I said calmly, pulling up pictures. I passed my family and went directly to my caught brother, handing him the proof. I've been collecting images ever since the first time he slapped me. I won't be the victim again. The truth is That I left him because he promised to kill me next time and I was afraid for my life. I ignored everyone else, staring at my brother and pleading with him to believe me. He flipped through the pictures, growing angrier with everyone. Finally, he handed the phone back to me and stood to his full height, turning to face my husband. My husband paled and stood to run, but my brother cut off his escape. I'm calling my partner, he said firmly. I'm off duty right now, but my partner is not. You're going away for hurting my sister. I cut my family off. After that, my brother had me move in with him and he cut contact with the family, too. My husband's trial was long and horrible. I had to stand up there and explain everything he did to me. But in the end, he was convicted and went away for a very long time. It took some time for me to recover, but with my brother's help, I Learned to love again.

We had this substitute teacher who thought he was hilarious, constantly making jokes at students expense. Most people just took it because if you talked back, he'd give you detention. So everyone stayed quiet. But this one kid, Marcus, what having it? The sub was taking attendance, going down the list, got to Marcus's name, pronounced it wrong on purpose. Marcus. The class went quiet. Marcus looked up. It's Marcus. The sub smirked. Did I say that right or are you gonna correct me like everyone else? The whole class went silent. Marcus didn't hesitate. You said it wrong, but I wouldn't expect you to get it right anyway. The sub's face turned red. Excuse me, you wanna repeat that? Marcus stood up, calm. Sure, you said my name wrong, but considering you're a substitute teacher at 50 years old, I'm not surprised reading is hard for you. The entire class gasped. Someone whispered, oh my god. Another kid covered their mouth. The sub just stared speech. Then he snapped back, get out principal's office now. Marcus grabbed his stuff, didn't rush, just packed his bag slowly, gladly. Anything's better than this. Then he walked out, the door closed. We all thought he was done for. But 20 minutes later, Marcus came back, walked into class, sat down. The sub looked at him, didn't say anything, just teaching. After class, we asked what happened. Principal just gave me a warning. That's it? Yeah. Apparently that sub has multiple complaints already. They're not renewing his contract. But Marcus wasn't done there. See, because this sub was 50, he had to go to the bathroom every 20 minutes. And when Marcus came back, the sub excused himself to go to the bathroom. Normally, we would start talking or go on our phones while we waited, but Marcus, he grabbed some Pepto Bismal and poured it all into the sub's coffee. The entire class was recording. And when the sub came back, he drank his coffee like nothing had happened. That's when Marcus asked if he could go to the bathroom. Now, instead of actually using the bathroom, he went to go jam every male bathroom in our school. Came back like nothing had happened. And our class continued like nothing had happened. But about 5 minutes later, the sub ran out the door and down the hallway. He was screaming for kids to move out of the way so that he could use the bathroom. But when he saw that all the male bathrooms were locked, he had no choice, either hold it in or go in the girls bathroom. He chose the second option. He ran in as fast as he could into the closest girl bathroom. But the second he did, one of the girls in there started screaming, oh, my god, what are you doing here? The sub tried to explain, but it was too late. The principal came to the scene. He tried to explain, but she wouldn't let him. Sir, you're fired. And Marcus, the cameras were conveniently not working that day due to maintenance, so he never got caught.

She showed up at my door last Tuesday with two garbage bags, our mom and the audacity of someone who thinks three years erases everything. No apology, no, hey, been a while. Just I need your spare bedroom until I get back on my feet. I haven't seen her since the sentencing. The day the judge gave her 18 months for identity theft and fraud. Mom and dad sat behind her crying while I sat on the opposite. I was with grandma whose hand was shaking in mine. For context, my sister has been the golden child since birth. Only girl, three older brothers and parents who thought the sun rose and set with her growing up she could do no wrong. Broke my stuff, boys should share. Stole money from my wallet. I must have miscounted. Got caught shoplifting at 16. The store was being dramatic. I moved out at 19 and watched from a distance as she spiraled. Dropped out of college twice, got fired from every job for not showing up. Maxed out dad's credit cards on a trip to Vegas. They always bailed her out, always made excuse. And three years ago, she crossed a line even they couldn't ignore. She stole our 74 year old grandmother's identity and opened five credit cards in her name. $40,000 in debt for designer bags, bottle service and A trip to Miami with her boyfriend. Grandma only found out when debt collectors started calling, threatening to take her house. The house Grandpa built, the house where she raised four kids and buried her husband almost lost because her granddaughter wanted a Gucci bag. I was the only one who testified against her. Mom and dad begged me not to press charges, said we could work it out as a family, that sending her to jail would ruin her life. I looked him dead in the eye and said, she already ruined Grandma's. we haven't exactly been close. Now she's standing in my apartment, the one I bought by working 60 hour weeks as a paralegal, making demands like she's checking into a hotel. She wants to borrow my car for job interviews, needs $500 for professional clothes because no one will hire me looking like this. Oh, and can I co sign a lease for her next month because her credits complete, completely destroyed. Mom's nodding along like these are perfectly reasonable requests. Like the past three years didn't happen. I just stood there in shock while my sister walked around my apartment critiquing my furniture. This couch is kind of ugly. When are you getting a new one? She picked up a photo of me and grandma from last Christmas and barely glanced at it before putting it face down. Then she opened my fridge, grabbed my leftover Thai food, the pad Thai I've been Thinking about all day at work and said, you're not still mad about the whole grandma thing, right? That was like forever ago. People make mistakes. That's when something in me snapped. I asked her if she ever apologized to grandma. She rolled her eyes and said, mom made me write a letter from jail. God, you're so dramatic. I asked if she knew grandma had a heart attack from the stress, had to sell her car to pay off some of the debt, still works part time at 77 because her retirement got destroyed. My sister shrugged, actually shrugged. That's not really my problem anymore. I did my time. I'm trying to move forward. I walk.

I decided not to tell my mom about it. The morning of the interview, I told my mom I was meeting a friend for coffee before driving straight to the office building. The interview had just started and it seemed to be going great. Olivia, the current marketing director, was funny and very professional. It seems like you'd really be a great fit for the team and company, she started saying. When the doors to her office suddenly opened and my mom walked in. She didn't even knock. She just sat down in the empty chair beside me and explain and that she wanted to be there to support me and make sure I presented myself properly. She turned to Olivia and smiled sweetly, don't mind me, just continue. Olivia looked confused and tried to continue it professionally. She continued where we left off and asked me about my previous marketing experience. Before I could answer, my mom cut in. She complained that the question was too vague and told me not to answer. Olivia looked at me with wide eyes while I stared back with an apologetic look. Her jaw clenched. She tried redirecting the question back to me, but my mom kept interrupting, correcting my answers, adding details that weren't even true. She even called Olivia's questions basic and uninspired, how she expected more from a director level position. she turned to me and started asking me difficult interview questions only to Get angry. When I couldn't answer, that's when I had it. I was done. I interrupted my mom mid question and told her to leave. Her face turned red with rage. How dare you speak to your mother like this? You're clearly not ready for this job if you can't handle a simple interview, she shouted as if she were the one in charge of hiring me. Olivia stood up and pointed at the door. You're the one who's being rude. Before you stepped in, I was already practically handing your daughter a job offer before you stepped into this room and started running your mouth and taking over. But this ends here. I'm the director and you're no longer welcome here. Olivia called in security. My mom gripped the door frame, screeching about discrimination and abuse as they dragged her out. Rest gave Olivia the full picture of what I've been dealing with. She offered me the job and said anyone who could stay composed through that deserved a chance. She even helped me find temporary housing. So for three months, my life was exactly what I'd always dreamed it would be. I worked hard, made real friends, built my career without anyone interfering. But then came the court date for her trespassing charges. I thought it would be simple, just a formality until Mom's lawyer stood up and presented her evidence against me.

I don't speak the language, but their tone sounded secretive. The other tech kept glancing at me and shaking her head like she disagreed with whatever Amy was saying. Then the salon owner walked over. This tiny Vietnamese woman who's usually super sweet and always remembers my name, but when she saw my nails, her face went completely white. She started yelling at Amy in Vietnamese. Get louder and more upset by the second. Amy was trying to defend herself, but the owner was having none of it. The entire salon went dead silent. Every conversation stopped. All the nail dryer seemed to pause at once. Even the music felt quieter. Everyone was staring at our station trying to figure out what was happening. I was sitting there with these horrible nails, feeling like I was in the middle of some drama. I didn't understand. The. The owner turned to me and asked to see my nails up close. When I showed her, she actually gasped. She grabbed Amy's supply tray and started examining the polish bottles. That's when she found it. Amy had been using practice polish, the cheap stuff they use when training new techs. It's basically coloured water that's never supposed to touch paying customers. But it gets worse. The owner kept digging through Amy's Supplies and found a whole stash of expired products. Polish that had separated, base coats that had gone bad, top coats that were thick as glue. Apparently, Amy had been using The old expired stuff on certain clients and pocketing the difference when the salon charged for premium services. The owner was furious. She started demanding to know how long this had been going on and which clients Amy had been scamming. Amy finally broke down and admitted she'd been doing it for three weeks. She was trying to save money for her boyfriend's birthday and figured no one would notice if she used the cheap supplies on clients who seemed less important. The owner immediately fired Amy on the spot. She made her leave through the back door so she wouldn't cause more of a scene. Then she personally removed my botched manicure and redid it herself using the good products. She refused to let me pay and gave me a gift certificate for three free services as an apology.

I was getting my nails done for my cousin's wedding. Nothing fancy, just a basic French manicure. The place was packed on a Saturday afternoon. Nail texts, chatting with clients, music playing, typical salon noise. I've been going to the same salon for two years and knew most of the workers. My usual girl wasn't there, so they assigned me to this new tech named Amy. Amy seemed nervous from the start. She kept looking around the salon while she worked, almost like she was scared someone would catch her doing something wrong. When I asked for the French tips, she got this weird look on her face and started mumbling about how maybe I should pick a different color instead. I thought it was strange but figured maybe she was just new and wasn't confident with French manicures yet. Then she started applying the white tips and I noticed something was off. The polish looked chunky and was separating on the brush. It was going on all streaky and uneven. When I mentioned it looked a bit thick, Amy got defensive and said that's just how French manicures look, but I'd gotten dozens of them before and this definitely wasn't right. That's when I heard whispering from the station next to me. The client was getting these gorgeous gel nails with perfect French tips that looked nothing like the mess Amy was putting On mine, I glanced over and saw the tech using completely different products, brand new bottles, expensive looking gel polish, while Amy was using what looked like old, crusty regular polish that had probably been sitting around for months. I started paying closer attention to what was happening around the salon. Three other clients were getting French manicures and they all looked perfect, clean, white tips, smooth application, professional results. Meanwhile, my nails looked like a kindergarten had painted them with craft paint. The white was bumpy, yellowing and already starting to chip at the edges. I asked Amy why mine looked so different from everyone else's. She got all flustered and said something about different nail types requiring different products. But I've had these same nails for 26 years and they've never required special chunky polish before. Something was definitely up during the drying process. I pretended to look for something in my purse, but was actually listening to Amy talk quietly with another tech.

I called my mom immediately. Turns out Emma had been planning her own wedding for the past month and had set the date for two weeks before mine to the same venue with the same photographer I booked. She'd even hired the same florist and picked similar flowers. When I confronted her, she just laughed and said great minds think alike and that she'd always dreamed of having her wedding there, too. She claimed it was just a coincidence, but I knew better. She'd literally copied my entire wedding and scheduled it right before mine so everyone would be broke and tired by the time my day came around. The worst part was how my family reacted. My aunt said I should be honored that Emma liked my ideas so much. My mom suggested maybe I could be Emma's maid of honor since it would be so sweet to have cousins in each other's weddings. I was furious. Emma had stolen my vendors, my venue, and now she wanted me to be in her copycat wedding while she completely overshadowed mine. Ben was ready to drive down there and give her a piece of his mind, but I had a better idea. I called the venue and photographer and told them what happened. Turns out Emma had name dropped me to get better deals, claiming we Were planning sister weddings together. The venue manager was horrified and immediately canceled Emma's booking she'd lied about having my permission to use my vendor relationships. When the photographer found out Emma had basically stolen his services from another bride, he backed out, too. Within 24 hours, Emma's entire wedding fell apart no decent vendor wanted to work with someone who'd scam another bride. Her boyfriend broke up with her a week later. Apparently, he'd been uncomfortable with how obsessed she was with copying my wedding. And when everything fell apart, he realized she cared more about the party than actually marrying him.

My cousin Emma was always the golden child in our family. She could sneeze and my aunt would throw her a parade. When we were kids, she'd always find ways to one up me at family events. If I got an a on a test, suddenly she was getting straight A's. If I got a new bike for my birthday, she'd get one that was better the next week. But the worst part was how she treated anyone who got close to me. Every boyfriend I brought to family gatherings would somehow end up talking to Emma by the end of the night. She'd flip her hair, laugh at their dumb jokes, and suddenly they'd be asking for her number instead of texting me back. When I turned 21, I finally decided to distance myself. I moved three hours away from my master's degree and only came home for major holidays. It was the best decision I ever made because that's where I met Ben. Ben was different from the guys I dated before. He was funny without trying too hard, smart but not arrogant about it. And he actually listened when I talked. We've been together for two years when he proposed and I was over the moon. Planning our wedding was amazing. Ben's family welcomed me with open arms. For the first time in my life, I felt like I belonged somewhere. When it came time To send out invitations, I had a really hard choice to make about my family. My mom begged me to invite Emma. She said family was family and that Emma had grown up a lot since I moved away. Against my better judgment, I sent her an invitation. Part of me hoped maybe things really had changed. Emma Rsvped yes and even offered to help with wedding planning. She called me a few times asking about details, what flowers I picked, what the venue looked like, who the photographer was. I thought she was genuinely trying to be supportive. Two months before my wedding, I was scrolling through Instagram when I saw it. Emma had posted a picture.

My sister Cassandra always competed with me. When I got promoted, she'd post about her MLM success. When I bought a house, she'd share photos of her rental like it was a mansion. But when my daughter Amelia started call, calling her stepdad, real daddy, Cassandra's jealousy turned dangerous. The first CPS report came three days after Amelia's birthday party. Someone claimed I was emotionally abusing her by restricting her diet and forcing medical treatments. I explained Amelia is type 1 diabetic and literally needs insulin injections to survive. I showed them her complete medical records and endocrinologist contact. Case closed immediately. The second report arrived two weeks later. Someone said I was severely neglecting Amelia's education because she wasn't enrolled in public school. I'm a certified teacher who home schools her for advanced abilities. I provided standardized test score. She was reading at high school level and doing eighth grade mathematics at age 7. Case dismissed again. Cassandra would text me after each investigation with 8 concern. Hey, sis, just checking how you're holding up during this difficult time. If you need any support, I'm always here. She started offering to babysit Amelia more frequently, saying I needed breaks too focus on getting my life together. The third report claimed Amelia was malnourished because she was small. Our pediatrician had to write an official letter explaining that Amelia was perfectly healthy. Just naturally petite, like my grandmother. During this investigation, Cassandra showed up with expensive groceries to help during this crisis. I caught her secretly photographing my refrigerator before restocking it, arranging everything perfectly. She even took photos of Amelia's bedroom, claiming she wanted to document the living conditions. That's when everything clicked. Cassandra wasn't just harassing me out of jealousy. She was systematically building a custody case to steal Amelia permanently. Every false report was designed to make me look while positioning herself as the stable alternative. I started watching Cassandra's parenting with her twins, Isaac and Blake. They were constantly dirty, with unwashed hair and stained clothes. I'd watch them eating candy for breakfast when I dropped Amelia off. Their dad worked overseas, leaving Cassandra alone for months. Amelia mentioned strange things after sleepovers. Cassandra would put the to bed early, then leave her watching them while she went to business meetings until after midnight. The twins would cry, asking where Mommy went. Amelia made them sandwiches and let them sleep sleep in her bed when scared. Cassandra posted about being a super mom, but her photos showed dishes piled high, laundry everywhere, kids in dirty clothes. Amelia said Cassandra spent day is crying on calls about being trapped with demon kids, while twins watch screens all day, unchanged and barely fed. My plan formed when Cassandra asked to keep Amelia for a long weekend while I apartment hunted. She'd been pushing for more overnight visits. I agreed, but Said I wanted to document everything for my court case against CPS. I gave Cassandra a detailed notebook to track Amelia's meals, activities, and bedtime. Cassandra loved this idea. She'd prove what an amazing aunt she was and help build my case. Friday, I dropped Amelia off with secret instructions to help Cassandra write everything down, including what the twins did and when Cassandra left. Sunday, pick up Cassandra.

My roommate Keisha, was getting ready to head out to her salon and saw me struggling with my massive curls in the bathroom mirror. She just laughed and said, girl, come with me. My stylist will sort you out. I was hesitant because I'd never been to a black salon before, but honestly, my hair was so bad, I would have tried anything. Walking into that salon was like entering a whole different world. The energy was incredible. Everyone was talking, laughing, music playing, kids running around while their moms got their hair done. It felt alive in a way that the quiet, sterile salons I was used to never did. The stylist, Miss Janet, took one look at my hair and shook her head, baby, who's been cutting your hair? Because they need to stop. She started running her fingers through it, asking me about my routine, what products I used, how I dried it. Nobody had ever asked me those questions before. They just wet it, cut it, and send me on my way. Miss Janet spent two hours on my hair. Two hours. He deep conditioned it, trimmed each curl individually, showed me how to scrunch it properly, and sent me home with specific instructions about what products to use and how often to wash it. My hair looked better than it ever had in my entire life. But here's the thing that really got me. She charged me $40. 40. The salon back home charged

He bent slightly toward Abner. You know how to talk, don't you, sweet boy? Abner squawked, almost as if responding, tilting his head one by one. The other officer's expression softened. Then laughter burst from them, loud, uncontrollable, and completely unexpected. Squawk! Squawk! You know how to talk, the lead officer mimicked, waving a hand at Abner, who responded with another squeaky, proud squawk. My shoulders relaxed slightly, though my heart was still pounding in disbelief. I laughed too, a nervous, relieved laugh that quickly turned to genuine. Abner hopped up and down lightly on my shoulder, pecking his feathers as thoroughly enjoying the attention. The tension that had once overcome the park moments ago seemed to disappear completely. You're off the hook this time, miss, the lead officer finally said, shaking his head but still laughing. But you better take that thing to a vet. Rabies shot, check out the works.

Yes, but keep him away from me next time, another officer added, still Laughing under his breath, I exhaled. Abner ruffled his feathers happily. Letting out one last squawk. I stroked his head, whispering, see, I told you we'd be okay. The park returned to its usual hum children laughing, joggers passing, birds chirping. But for me, nothing felt ordinary. Abner wasn't just a pet. He was a protector, a companion, and somehow a hero. That day, a simple walk in the park had turned into an adventure I would never forget. And as the officers drove away, still chuckling at the sight of a crow talking back to them, I realized just how lucky I was, not only to have Abner, but to have him by my side when the world seemed ready to take him away.

The cast member kept apologizing and my sister started crying. The family in front of us was walking away with their kid holding the bucket above his head. My sister took off running and my mom went right after her. My sister tried to grab the bucket from the kid's hands. The dad pulled his son away and my sister was screaming, you don't even care about figment. You're just gonna throw that away in a week. My mom shoved the dad so hard he stumbled backwards. Then she lunged at the kid and grabbed the bucket. Kids started wailing. The other mom tried to grab it back and my mom yanked it away so hard the handle broke. My sister dropped to her knees sobbing, no, you broke it. Then she looked up at me with pure hatred. This is all your fault. If you had run when I told you to, we would have been ahead of them. Disney security showed up and escorted us past hundreds of people who were recording and Staring. My sister was crying so hard she could barely walk. And my mom was arguing with security the entire time. We got taken to some office where a supervisor explained that we were banned from all Disney properties. Mom tried to argue that my sister has a medical condition. My daughter needs this popcorn bucket for her mental health. My dad was sitting in the corner with his head in his hands. My sister was on her phone looking up resale prices for the bucket and crying harder every time she refreshed. The supervisor said we needed to leave immediately and that if we tried to come back, we'd be arrested for trespassing. They walked us out through a back exit. We had dinner reservations that night that cost $400 and we missed it because we spent three hours getting banned from Disney World. We drove back to the hotel in complete silence except for my sister sobbing in the back seat. My mom kept saying that family is going to sell that bucket for hundreds of dollars. That's why they wanted it so badly. I checked my phone and my sister had posted a five paragraph ran about Disney discriminating against adults and how I ruined her life by not caring about her passion. My mom had already commented, so proud of you for standing up for yourself, baby girl.

The animal control truckled up as soon as the team saw me. I was taking my crow for a walk in the park, and he was sitting on my shoulder, relaxing, his feathers catching sunlight. I was shaking so hard. No license, no paperwork. Just me and him. My heart pounded so hard I thought it might give me away before I could even open my mouth. May I help you, miss? One of the officers leaned out the window, his eyes moving between me and Abner. Do you. Do you have a license for him? The officer went on, frowning as his partner stepped a bit closer. No, I whispered, hugging Abner tighter. But he's harmless. Really smart. The officer's eyes thinned. Miss, you need a license for that animal. Wild pets can be dangerous. You can't just walk around with him in public. My stomach dropped. He's fine, I said, trying to keep my voice steady. He's trained. You won't. Sorry, miss, but we have to take him in for an examination to make sure he doesn't carry any diseases. My chest went tight, and for a second I froze. But there was no way I was letting them take Abner without a fight. The lead officer's face went white. Hand him over now. Or else what? I snapped, my voice shaking. You'll be taken in for questioning. Either way, he comes with us. Never! I yelled, running down the park pathway. My feet barely touched the pavement as I ran as fast as I could, passing by joggers and picnickers who were just staring at us. Behind me I could hear the officer shouting, catching up with me. My mind raced. What could I possibly say to keep Abner miss? The officer shouted again. Closer! This time! My lungs burned. I suddenly stopped, holding Abner tight to my chest. I swear, officer, I really do have a license for him! I cried. Abner's been my pet for years. He's my emotional support animal. Please, please don't take him away! Abner flapped his wings and let out a series of sharp swawks. His claws tapped my shoulder as if asking me to hold still. Then, without warning, he moved forward, pecking at the closest officer's uniform. It was mass chaos. Arms waved, shouts echoed across the park. People near

So I made them admit I was their only successful child. I was adjusting my durag before bed when my parents called. Don't take this the wrong way, but we think it's better if you don't come to your sister's gacha day. The club just started allowing mixed families. We're not pushing it by bringing both of you. You see, Harper was my adopted sister. White skin, blonde hair that didn't move, perfect blue eyes. And I was their mixed race son with black skin that couldn't be bleached. I thought if I funded her day, they'd see me differently. Dad jumped in. Look, we already allocated your contribution to other expenses. Anyway, the $75,000 you sent is being put to good use. They didn't know that the venue, caterers and florists all had one thing in common. Me as their boss. So you're keeping my money but not inviting me? It's Harper's day, mom said simply. You understand? I go and mustard out a yes before hanging up. That's when I decided my family was about to learn what happens when you bite the hand that feeds you. I thought back to my childhood. Mine and Harper's birthdays fall on the same month, two weeks apart. Harper's parties cost five grand with a bounce house and catered food. Mine was a grocery store cake mom forgot to pick up until six PM because of budget issues. By the time Harper hit high school, I was basically invisible unless I did something wrong. Like when she threw my Xbox down the stairs during an argument. My parents told me, it's just a game, Malcolm. Grow up. But when I accidentally scratched her bike, grounded, and had to pay for repairs out of my allowance. An hour after they hung up on me, my phone rang. It was Celia, the event coordinator of my company. Mister Malcolm, your family just called about your sister's Celebration. What now? They want to ensure all food is appropriate for their real guests, not urban preferences. They were very specific about menu changes. Celia, can we still cancel their entire booking? Cancel? Sir, their event is in 3 weeks. What exactly have they booked with us? The Skyline Ballroom, Golden Catering, Divine Flowers, our transport fleet, photographers. Sir, they've booked nearly $200,000 in services. I laughed. I couldn't help it. My parents had hired my entire company while trying to keep me out. Cancel everything. Silence then, sir, cancel it all. Venue, food, flowers, everything. Send them a notice that their event has been terminated due to violation of our inclusion policy.

My sister has been obsessed with Disney since we were kids, but it got really bad after college. She's 24 now and has an annual pass even though we live in Ohio, which means my parents fund her monthly trips to Florida. Her room looked like a Disney store exploded in it. She has hundreds of collector pins covering every surface and a shrine to pigment the dragon in the corner. She even tracks limited edition merchandise on a spreadsheet. My parents pay for everything because she claimed she was building a business selling Disney content, but her Instagram only had 200 followers. I wanted nothing to do with this weird Disney worship, but my mom somehow guilt tripped me and to going on a family trip with them. The trip was a nightmare from day one. My sister had a full itinerary planned down to the minute, including which bathrooms we were allowed to use. She cried twice before lunch on the first day because a character meet and greet line was too long. My parents just kept apologizing to her and buying her stuff to calm her down. By day three, I was looking at flights home. That's when my sister burst into my room at 6:00am. The segment bucket drops tomorrow, she said like she was announcing someone died. She made us sit through a 45 Minute presentation about how we were going to obtain the bucket. My mom was taking notes and my dad asked if we needed walkie talkies. When I said it's just a popcorn bucket, my sister's face went red. You don't get me. You never have. My mom squeezed my arm. Please just support her. The next morning, we got to Epcot two hours before it opened. When the gates opened, everyone started power walking toward the store. My sister was practically running and my parents were right behind her. I was walking at a normal pace because as I don't run for anyone. When we got in line at the store, it was already wrapped around the building. My sister was on her phone refreshing five different Disney Facebook groups and doing breathing exercises. My mom was next to her saying, you're doing so good, baby. We're almost there. When we finally got close to the front, a cast member came out.

Every Sunday for 15 years, my grandmother made the same announcement at family dinner. When I pass away, everything goes to whoever visits me most. She tap her cane on the floor, smile like she just revealed state secrets. This turned my entire extended family into vultures. My Aunt Rachel drove three hours every Tuesday just to vacuum Grandma's living room. Uncle Steve called twice daily asking about her arthritis. My cousin Jennifer moved back from California and started doing Grandma's grocery shopping. They all hated each other, but pretended to be saints around her. Meanwhile, I was banned from inheritance discussion. I liked guys and chicken nuggets, and grandma made it crystal clear that sinners don't deserve family money. She'd change the subject whenever I entered rooms. My cousins would smirk and whisper about how I'd be working at McDonald's while they lived in luxury. But here's what none of them knew. I actually loved spending time with grandma. Not for money, she'd already told me I wasn't getting any, but because she was genuinely funny. When she wasn't performing for the Inheritance Hunters while they argued over who deserved what, I'd sneak over on Wednesday nights to watch old movies and eat ice cream. Grandma would relax completely when it was just us. She'd tell dinosaurs jokes from the 2000 BC and complain about how fake everyone was being. She even started asking about My boyfriend and seemed genuinely interested in our relationship. I never mentioned these visits to anyone because I knew they'd think I was scheme. After she passed last year, the whole family gathered for the will reading. Rachel brought a calculator. Steve wore his funeral suit from 1995. Jennifer had already started planning her European vacation. They were practically drooling as the lawyer opened the envelope.

Tim will handle tonight's demonstration, she announced with fake authority dripping from every word. You're needed in the children's touch tank area for deep cleaning duties. Everyone in that equipment room knew exactly what would happen if Tim approached Poseidon during feeding time, when the octopus was most territorial and aggressive, but I looked Caroline directly in the eyes and explained the obvious anyway. Poseidon won't accept food from Tim, and he becomes violent when strangers approach during his dinner routine. Caroline snapped back that we managed without the feeding demonstration and gave me a direct order to report to the children's area immediately or face consequences. I slowly unclipped my security badge and identification card, placing both items on the stainless steel prep counter while our senior aquarist and two night staff members watched this confrontation unfold in stunned silence. I pulled out my phone to start recording and told Caroline that Poseidon was in full hunting mode because it was feeding time and Tim knew where all the equipment was stored. Caroline's face turned bright red when she realized I was documenting our conversation for legal purposes. If you walk out of this building, you're terminated immediately and permanently. I replied calmly that this was perfectly fine with me, already hearing Poseidon's agitated flashing echoing from the deep sea exhibit two rooms away. I'm recording this for unemployment documentation.

I was the only night keeper at our aquarium who could handle Poseidon, our four million dollar giant Pacific octopus. And that evening he wrapped all eight arms around my forearm to gently pull crab from my beating tongues. His massive 200 pound body moved with surprising Grace through the crystal clear water of his tank. But when any other keeper approached, the same gentle creature became a destructive nightmare that sprayed black ink everywhere and destroyed thousands of dollars it's worth of equipment. Our new operations director Caroline watched from the observation deck with her arms crossed, clearly unimpressed by what she called my animal dependency problem during yesterday's staff meeting. She believed every creature should have multiple handlers because no single employee should be irreplaceable, especially not because of some oversized sea creature that cost more than most people's houses. Caroline had spent three weeks documenting every minor violation she could manage. Manufacturer writing me up for wearing a different brand of reef safe sunscreen than the one corporate required even though their brand gave me hives and docking my pay. When Poseidon's complex eating routine ran five minutes over my scheduled break, her masterpiece was hiring Tim, her former assistant manager who spent entire shifts taking Instagram selfies near the shark tank and had never worked with cephalopods in his 24 years of existence. Poseidon hated Tim with a burning intensity of a thousand suns shooting Pressurized water jets that soaked him completely whenever he approached the tank. And once Tim slipped so dramatically on the wet observation deck that he crashed through a three thousand dollar interactive display about octopus intelligence. Tim's solution was to stand 15 feet away from the tank and throw food pellets like he was feeding pigeons at the park, which made Poseidon retreat to his cave and refuse to eat for two entire days. A disaster struck on a Wednesday evening when major marine research donors were arriving for a private feeding demonstration at 8:30, specifically requesting to see our famous octopus interact with his primary caregiver 20 minutes before the V I. P. Tour.

When I brought it up, he said you're too old to care about birthdays. Anyway, I packed my stuff that night. He woke up to me loading the last box in my car. Last year when Kyle forgot, I convinced myself it was fine. We'd only been dating eight months. He apologized with gas station flowers at midnight after his gaming session. He make it up to me. I believed him because I'm an idiot. This year. I didn't even hint about it. I wanted to see if he'd remember on his own. Spoiler alert, he didn't. I spent my 24th birthday eating leftover pizza while he yelled at his monitor about some tournament. Around ten PM, I finally said something. You know what today is? He didn't even pause his game. Tuesday, it's my birthday, Kyle. He actually groaned like I was annoying him. Babe, you're 24. You're too old to care about birthdays. Anyway, that's kids stuff. Something in me just snapped. This was the same guy who made me drive across town last month to get his favorite energy drink for his birthday, who posted a whole Instagram story about turning 25, who expected me to remember his mom's birthday, his dad's birthday, his dog's birthday. Didn't yell, didn't cry, just said okay and went to the bedroom. He probably thought he won the argument. I heard him back in his game two seconds later. Laughing with his friends on discord. I started packing at eleven PM was first then my bathroom stuff, then books. I was methodical about it. My hands were shaking but I kept going. The apartment was technically his. I'd moved in six months ago to save money, which really meant I paid half his rent while he bought new gaming equipment. Around 2:00am I was carrying boxes to my car. Our neighbor Trevor was coming home from his night shift at the hospital. He saw me loading up and didn't ask questions. Tell the building door open for me. You need help he asked quietly. I got it. Thanks. Good for you he said and I almost started crying right there in the parking lot. I made four trips total. My last box had kitchen stuff I'd bought my coffee maker, my nice pan set, the toaster. Kyle never cooked anyway. He'd survive on Doordash like he did before I moved in. I was putting the final box in my trunk when I heard our apartment door open. Kyle was standing there in his boxers looking confused. What are you doing leaving? Cause of the birthday thing. Come on, don't be dramatic. I slammed my trunk shut. I'm not being dramatic. I'm being done. He walked closer, finally looking actually concerned. Where are you even gonna go? My friend Rachel's already texted her. Rachel had responded in literally 30 seconds with her address and doors unlocked. Spare room is yours Kyle ran his hand through his hair. This is, it's crazy. You're really leaving over a birthday? No, I'm leaving because you made me feel stupid for wanting the bare minimum. I'm leaving because last week you remembered your Twitch subscribers cat's name, but not my birthday. I'm leaving because I've been here six months and you still introduce me as my girl to your friends instead of using my actual name. That last part just came out. I didn't even know it bothered me until I said it. He started backtracking. Okay, okay. I messed up. Let's talk about this inside.

My stepdaughter Isabelle, is 17. For three years, I've been the one doing everything. Her bio mom lives across the country with her new family and calls maybe twice a year, usually on Isabel's birthday and Christmas. Meanwhile, I'm the one waking up at 5:00am to drive Isabel to volleyball practice, packing her lunches with those expensive protein bars she likes, sitting through parent teacher conferences, and spending my weekends helping her with college applications. I never asked for a trophy. I just loved this kid and wanted her to succeed. Last month, Isabel came to me with her bone, showing me this massive Lululemon haul. $800 worth of leggings, sports bras. And I looked at the total and took a breath. Okay, here's the deal, I said. Keep your grades above a B average, do your weekend chores without me nagging, and we'll split us. I'll pay half as an early birthday gift. She hugged me. You're the best mom. That mom hit different. She started calling me that about a year ago. Two weeks went by. Her room became a war zone. Clothes everywhere, dishes growing. Science experiment. I'd remind her about our deal, and she'd say, yeah, I know. But nothing changed. Report card came home, three C's and a D in history. I sat her down at the kitchen table. M. We talked about this. No shopping trip. Until your grades improve. She stared at her phone. That's not fair. Everyone has those outfits for games. Life's not fair. The deal was clear. She rolled her eyes and walked away. Ten minutes later, I heard her on the phone in her room, voice all shaky and dramatic. She was calling her dad at work. He came home too, hours early. Pulled me into our bedroom and closed the door. Just buy her the clothes, he said. She's stressed about college applications. It's not that serious. My stomach dropped. We made an agreement. She needs to learn responsibility. You're being too hard on her, he said, not meeting my eyes. Besides, she's not even your real daughter. Maybe you don't understand the pressure she's under. I felt like I've been slapped. Those words just hung in the air. Not your real daughter. After three years of being the only mother figure she actually had. I looked at him for a long moment. You're absolutely right. I'm not her real parent. The next morning, I didn't wake Isabel up for practice. I made myself coffee and sat in the kitchen reading. Around 6:15, she came running downstairs in her practice gear, panicking, mom, we're late. Coach is gonna kill me. I sipped my coffee. Ask your real parents. She stared at me confused. What? Your dad's your real parent. He can drive you. My husband came stumbling down in his pajamas. What's going on? Your daughter needs a ride to Practice, I said calmly. He looked between us, completely lost. But you always. Not anymore. They left in chaos. Isabel forgot her water bottle and knee pads. My husband was still in his slippers that afternoon. I didn't start dinner. I ordered takeout for myself. When they came home at 7, Isabel looked around the kitchen. What's for dinner? I don't know. What did your real parents make? My husband pulled me aside. Okay, I get it. You're mad. But you're being petty. I'm being exactly what you told me to be. Not her parents. Day two, no laundry. Isabel's volleyball uniform sat dirty in the hamper. She had practice that evening. Mom, I don't have a clean uniform. Sounds like a problem for your real mom. She called her bio mom. Got voicemail. Isabel had

Diane started posting on Facebook about protecting children and everyone thought I was abusing my kids. Two weeks later, the case worker called us back to her office. There have been two more reports and that's three total. I could barely breathe. All three reports describe escalating neglect. And this is a high priority case. Now, I asked who kept calling, but she said she couldn't tell us. That night, Diane called my husband crying about how she couldn't watch this anymore. Please let me take the kids for a few weeks just until you get help. My husband's voice was hard when he said no. The crying stopped immediately and her voice turned cold. Then you're making a terrible mistake. Those kids will be removed either way. She hung up and my husband looked at me. Why does she want our kids so badly? The next morning, the case worker called saying there had been a fourth report and that my sister in law had requested emergency kinship placement. I started crying right there. I need you both in my office this afternoon. We drove there with everything we had. The case worker reviewed our documents for a long time before turning her computer screen toward us. Every single report came from the same phone number. All four reports came from Diane. In yesterday's report, she claimed your children told her directly they were being neglected. She pulled Out papers. These are the written transcripts from your children's school interviews and your children never said anything like that. She completely made it up. She slid photos across the desk showing exposed wire and black mold everywhere. Her home failed basic safety standards. And she also had a child welfare case eight years ago in another county where her own children were removed temporarily. She never told us about any of this. Case worker looked at us. Her oldest son called yesterday and said she did the same thing to his aunt 4 years ago by making false reports to try and get custody. This is a deliberate pattern. She closed the folder. Your case is closed and we're forwarding everything to the district attorney. Two days later, Diane was charged with 4 counts of filing false reports and fraud. My daughter asked why Aunt Diane wasn't coming to Thanksgiving and said, good. She always looked at us weird anyway.

Last month, I opened my front door to find a woman with a clipboard and a police officer behind her. I'm from Child Protective Services. We received a report about your children. I was terrified because I had no idea what she was talking about. My kids were at school and my house was clean. She inspected every room, taking photos and checking where my kids slept. When she left, she said someone would be in touch. I called my husband immediately, and we sat at the table trying to figure out who would report us. We didn't have enemies. Then his phone rang, and it was his sister, Diane. I heard CPS came by today. I'm so glad someone finally reported you. Those kids deserve so much better. I felt sick, and my husband went completely pale. He could barely get the words out. Diane, what are you talking about? She actually laughed. Everyone sees how you parent. I had to do something. Then she just hung up. The next day, my husband's mother called. Meaning? About how Diane told her I was neglecting the kids by leaving them home alone and not feeding them. His mother believed every word. And my husband tried defending me, but she wouldn't listen. Diane would never lie about the children. She loves them too much. I watched my husband's face just fall apart. Two Days later, CPS called again. My seven year old came home that afternoon and climbed into my lap, asking, Mommy, why did that lady keep asking if you leave us alone? I told her, you never do. My throat hurt and I couldn't answer her. My 10 year old wouldn't even look at me and just went to his room and slammed the door. I stood outside listening to him cry, and I felt completely helpless. And three days later, the case worker showed up unannounced, saying she needed to observe our family. She sat on my couch for two hours, watching us eat dinner and watching me help with homework while taking notes. The entire time, my daughter kept looking at her with these scared eyes. After she left, my daughter asked if they were taking her away, and I didn't know what to say. A week after that, my neighbor, who I'd known for five years, crossed the street to avoid me at my son's baseball game. The mothers I always sat with picked up their stuff and moved when I arrived.

All parents help their children, actually, came a small voice from the back row. Connor said his mom made him start over four times until it was perfect. Missus Prescott's face hardened. Elizabeth, mind your own business. I knelt beside Connor's desk. Connor, what book are you reading at home right now? His eyes darted to his mother, then back to me. The one about the wizard boy, he whispered. Harry Potter, I asked. He nodded slightly. What page are you on? 12, he mumbled. But mom reads me the hard parts. Missus Prescott's phone began ringing. She answered immediately, turning away from us. Yes, I'll be there. The meeting's running late. When she hung up, I stood my ground. Missus Prescott, I believe Connor needs reading support, not Advanced Placement. I'd like to recommend. Unacceptable, she snapped, gathering her things. I expect that plan implemented by tomorrow or I'll take this to the principal and the superintendent and the school board. As she stormed toward the door, she called back. Connor, don't forget you have piano at 4, then swimming at 5:30, then math tutoring at 7. After she left, the room remained silent until little Elizabeth spoke up. Connor, want to come to my birthday party Saturday? We're having a water balloon fight. Connor looked up, his eyes brightening slightly. My mom says I'm allergic to water balloons. That evening, I stayed late preparing a detailed assessment of Connor's actual reading level, along with Research based interventions. When Missus Prescott arrived for drop off the next morning, I handed her a folder. Here's my plan for Connor. I gave you my plan already, she said dismissively. Mine includes Connor's input, I replied, and documentation that will go to the school psychologist if you continue to push your son beyond his developmental capabilities. Her face paled. Are you threatening me? I'm advocating for Connor. That's my job. Six months later, Connor was reading at grade level and building his own science projects. Mrs. Prescott still Blairs at me during parent teacher conferences, but Connor smiles.

I was just three weeks into my first year teaching third grade when Missus Prescott marched into my classroom 15 minutes before dismissal. She wore a crisp business suit and carried a leather portfolio like it was a weapon. The children were finishing their science projects. Paper mache volcanoes that had taken us all week. Miss Wilson, she announced loudly, not caring that 27 8 year olds turned to stare. We need to discuss Connor's grades. I smiled professionally despite the interruption. I'd be happy to schedule a conference tomorrow. This is. Prescott didn't move now. It's fine. Connor needs to be moved to the advanced reading group immediately. Connor, a sweet boy who struggled to read at grade level, louched in his chair, cheeks burning red. Connor's making wonderful progress, I said quietly, but the advanced group might be frustrating for him right now. She pulled a document from her portfolio and slapped it on my desk. I've outlined a new education plan for Connor. You'll implement it starting tomorrow. It wasn't a request. The 10 page document detailed a complete curriculum rewrite for just her son. Demanded I give him different homework, different tests and 30 minutes of private tutoring daily during my lunch break. Missus Prescott, I can't give Connor a separate curriculum from the rest of the class. Her eyes narrowed. My husband and I donate significantly to this school. Perhaps you don't understand how Things work here. The classroom had gone silent. 27 pairs of eyes watched us, including Connor's, which were now filling with tears. Let's discuss this privately, I suggested. There's nothing to discuss. Sign this, acknowledging you've received Connor's new learning plan. I glanced at Connor, who was now hiding his face in his hands. Then I noticed something, his science project. Unlike the other volcanoes, Connor's was immaculate with perfect lettering and advanced features the other children hadn't attempted. Connor, did you make your volcano yourself? I asked gently. Before he could answer, missus Prescott cut in.

So I am destroying her dream of becoming a stepmother. I dated a guy named Joe for three months before he left me to go back to his ex, Kim. Right after we broke up, I found out I was pregnant and now I'm at 24 weeks. I let him know and he was ecstatic. It turns out his girlfriend had fertility issues and would likely never be able to get pregnant naturally. And he has always wanted to be a father. Getting back together was out of the question for both of us. So he's still with his girlfriend. Joe was only allowed at the initial appointment because of Covid 19 and we found out I was having twins. According to Joe, when he told Kim, she had a mental breakdown about her infertility and wanted to talk to me. I met them at their house and Kim stated that she wanted to be involved in my pregnancy because she would eventually be the children's stepmother. She started telling me that I needed to do a home birth, that I needed to formula feed so that they could have the babies half of the week, that she wanted one boy and one girl, and that she wanted the kid to call her mama since they would be calling me Mommy. I shut her down and said I would make the Best choices for my children and my body and left. Kim continued to be overbearing and texted me every day about my eating habits, exercise habits and butching about how her job wouldn't let her take maternity leave. At the virtual genetics counseling appointment she attended instead of Joe and took over the whole meeting trying to talk about her family history, which wasn't relevant. When it came time for my 20 week level 2 scan, they allowed me to have one guest and Joe suggested I take Kim instead of him, which I refused to do. Joe did end up coming and he found out the gender because I wanted to keep it a surprise for me so we could throw a gender reveal party. I put a pregnancy announcement on my social media and then she put up an announcement saying they were expecting twins the non traditional way and how blessed she was. I was irritated but I kept my mouth shut. Then she threw a gender reveal party and posted it on social media. I wasn't even invited. She also announced that she was having a baby shower. I commented on her posts and told her to stop treating me like a surrogate, the kids weren't hers and that Joe didn't have any claim or custody of the kids until they were born. I then called Joe and reiterated all of this and stated that I would not be seeing either of them until we went To family court and that my mother would be my birthing partner. Update, I never considered that this could have happened on purpose. We used condoms because I do not react well to hormonal birth control and I had to wait to get a non hormonal IUD because of other medical issues. The Thursday I posted this, I went to the police who stated that they could do nothing because a crime hadn't been committed in my state. The order.

My four year old daughter, Emma, started collecting teeth after her brother was born. Not just her own baby teeth, any teeth she could find. She'd trade toys at preschool for loose teeth, telling kids they were magic seeds for growing new babies. I thought it was quirky until I found 17 teeth hidden in her jewelry box, each one labeled with a date. The pediatrician said jealousy manifests in strange ways. My husband laughed it off, but Emma's behavior got stranger. She'd stand over baby Marcus's crib for hours, whispering numbers. 47, 48, 49. When I asked what she was counting, she'd say, his. That's mommy making sure he has enough. One morning, I caught her pressing her ear against my stomach. Emma, what are you doing? She looked up with those serious brown eyes, listening for the other one. My blood ran cold. What other one, sweetie? The one that's supposed to be here instead of Marcus. That's when she started the drawings. Hundreds of them. Always the same two babies, but one had wings. She'd tape them around Marcus's room like wallpaper so he remembers where to go, she explained. The breaking point came during Marcus's first birthday. Emma insisted on making the cake herself. I found her in the kitchen at dawn, mixing something thick and red into the batter. It's just food coloring, she said. But her hands were stained darker than any Food dye I'd seen during the party. She sang a different version of Happy Birthday. The words I caught chilled me. Happy last day to you. You. Happy last day to you. Happy last day. Dear Marcus, your replacement is due. That night, I found her in the nursery with a pair of Scissors cutting a perfect circle in the air above Marcus's sleeping form, creating a door. She whispered for the switch. We moved her to therapy immediately. Doctor Martinez said it was elaborate but harmless fantasy. Until the session where Emma calmly explained her plan. The tooth fairy brings babies, not money, she said. I collected enough teeth to trade. Marcus goes back.

I was working at the steakhouse called the Cedar Room when this family started coming in every Friday night. The dad would snap his fingers at me like I was his personal servant, demanding water refills before I could even set down their menus. The mom constantly sent food back claiming it was too cold or too salty, obviously just fishing for discounts. Their son, Nathan, this 14 year old with the smuggest face you've ever seen, was the absolute worst. From the moment they walked in, Nathan acted like he owned the place. He'd make comments like, do you even know how to write down orders right? And don't mess up my steak like last time, even though I'd never served him before. The kid would deliberately throw bread crumbs on the floor while staring me down, then tell his parents, this guy looks like he couldn't afford a haircut. His parents would just laugh and nod along like he was some comedy genius. Every week I dreaded seeing them walk through that door. The hostess Sarah, would give me this apologetic look whenever she seated them in my section. Other servers started avoiding eye contact when the family showed up, grateful it wasn't their turn to deal with the nightmare table. One Friday evening in December, I was having an especially rough day. My car had broken down that morning and I was already stressed about The repair costs. When I saw Nathan's family walk in, my heart sank. They got seated in my section again. I brought out their usual order, trying to stay professional despite Nathan's constant snide remarks. I bet you can't even afford what's on this plate, he said with this evil smirk, pointing at his perfectly cooked rib eye steak. Before I could respond, he grabbed the edge of the plate and flipped it over, sending the hot steak and mashed potatoes directly onto my shoes. The gravy splattered all over my uniform. His parents burst out laughing like it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen.

He got me and threw me away. My mom once told me when she was pregnant with me, she prayed for a boy. She already had two sons, but my dad wanted just one more son. He talked about it like he was building a team. But when I was born and the nurse said, it's a girl. My dad didn't even come near me. He walked out of the room. Didn't talk to my mom for two days. She laughed when she told me that I didn't. That moment set the tone for the rest of my life. My brothers were treated like kings. My dad took them to fancy schools, bought them new bikes, and always made sure they had the best. I was sent to a small, poor government school. No library, broken chairs, big classes. But I worked hard anyway. I studied under street lights when the power went out. And somehow I got better grades than all of them. But even when I came home with medals and top marks, they brushed it off. My grandma once said, smart girls are still just girls. My dad said, let's see what she does with all that studying. Girls just end up in kitchens anyway. Still, I kept pushing. At 18, I got a full scholarship for writing. I was the first one in the whole family to earn that kind of opportunity. I brought the letter home, heart racing. My mom Smiled softly. My dad glanced at it and said, so you're finally leaving? I packed my bags. No hugs, no goodbyes.

My family discovered I was good with kids when I was 14 and babysat my cousin once. That single afternoon of watching cartoons turned me into their unpaid nanny for the next 12 years. At first, it was just by my sister dropping off her toddler just for an hour while she ran errands. That hour turned into six when she decided to get her nails done instead. I. I remember sitting on my floor surrounded by broken crayons and goldfish crackers, realizing I missed my shift at the coffee shop. My brother joined in with midnight text about his twins needing an emergency sitter for his concert plans. College, they took it even further. My sister would bang on my dorm door and dump her kids for entire weekends. She cost me my first serious boyfriend when she called me during our anniversary dinner screaming about a fake emergency. My boyfriend looked at me across that candlelit table and said he couldn't do this anymore. After graduation, my parents made everything worse by secretly giving my siblings keys to my apartment. I started coming home from my marketing job to find kids destroying my kitchen and toys taking over my home office. My boss pulled me aside after I'd missed another presentation and told me to figure out my priorities. The moment they took it too far came three months ago when I woke up to voices in my living room. I stumbled out of my pajamas to find four kids watching cartoons with suitcases next to them. My sister's two kids and my brother's twins were all there eating my cereal like it was just another Saturday. On my counter was a note that made my hand shake. My entire family had booked a month long cruise to Europe and decided not to tell me because I'd make it difficult, the note said. They knew I take good care of the kids like I always do. I kept reading it over and over trying to understand how they could just leave the country without even asking me. My sister had attached a grocery list and my brother left $200 for expenses. I was their personal hired help. They could book without notice. The youngest kid looked up and asked if I was making pancakes for breakfast. That innocent question broke something inside me because these kids had no idea their parents had just abandoned them. That's when I decided to teach them what abandonment really felt like. You see, 12 years of forced babysitting had taught me every rule about child welfare and what authorities look for. I made the kids breakfast and told them we were going to play a game where they told me about all the times they stayed with me before. I recorded videos on my phone as they excitedly shared stories about being dropped off for Days without their parents checking in. The seven year old even mentioned the time his mom left him here when he had strep throat. I carefully documented the suitcases, note and the pathetic $200 meant to last a month. Then I looked up the number for Child Protective Services. My family thought they were getting a free month in Europe. Instead, they were about to learn what happens when you abandon your children with someone who knows the system. I called CPS and reported four abandoned minors with no guardianship papers. The caseworker arrived within two hours and went pale reading the note. By afternoon, the kids were in emergency.

I had sworn I would never talk to my little sister Mia again, not after she picked that scumbag, Blake, over our entire family. For 2 whole years, I stuck to my word like it was carved in stone. Blake was the guy who got our cousin Jenny hooked on pills. He would sell them to her behind the school, then act all innocent when she overdosed in the bathroom during homecoming. Jenny barely survived and our whole family watched her go through hell trying to get clean. But when I tried to warn me about what kind of person Blake really was, she laughed in my face. You're just jealous I have someone. She, I said, you can't stand seeing me happy for once. That was the night I told her if she stayed with him, she was dead to me. She chose him. So I chose to forget I had a sister. For 2 years, I never called, never texted, never checked her Instagram or asked our parents how she was doing. When people brought her up, I would literally walk away. I told everyone, including our mom, I don't care if she's dying, I'm never talking to her again. My friends thought I was being dramatic. My parents kept begging me to reach out. But I had made a promise to myself and I was going to keep it no matter what. Then last Tuesday around midnight, someone Started pounding on my apartment door like the building was on fire. When I opened it, this dirty, sweating mess of a man pushed right past me into my living room. I recognized him instantly, Blake. He looked like he hadn't slept in days. His clothes were torn up. His hair was greasy, and he kept looking over his shoulder like someone was chasing him. That's when I noticed the kitchen knife tucked into his waistband. I need a place to hide, he said, pacing around my couch like a caged animal.

So I went to this Applebee's last Friday night around eight PM I get seated at this booth near the back and my waiter comes over. Guy looked like he was in his early 20s, kind of scrawny with this patchy beard. He takes my drink order, just a Coke, and disappears. For like 15 minutes I'm sitting there looking around, watching other tables get their food and I'm still waiting for my damn soda. Finally, he shows up with my Coke, doesn't even apologize, just flops it down and asks what I want to eat. I order the chicken tenders with honey mustard and seasoned fries. Pretty basic stuff. He writes it down and vanishes again. 20 minutes go by, nothing. I can see him at the computer terminal just standing there scrolling on his phone. Other waiters are running around actually doing their jobs, but this guy is just chilling. I try to get his attention a couple times, but he's completely ignoring my section. After another 10 minutes, I flag down a different waitress, older lady with gray hair who looked like she actually cared about her job. I asked her if she knows what happened to my food order. She looks confused and goes to check. Turns out my waiter never even put my order in the system. The lady, her name tag said Janet, looked embarrassed as hell. She apologizes and immediately puts my order In says the kitchen will rush it. But now I've been sitting there for almost an hour with nothing but a warm Coke. My food finally comes out, but guess who brings it? Not my original waiter. Janet brings it over with another apology. The chicken tenders are overcooked and the fries are cold. At this point, I'm just hungry and tired, so I eat it anyway. The whole time I'm eating, I can see my waiter at the bar area talking to some girl who's clearly not working there. He's completely forgotten I exist. Never checked on me once after taking my drink order, never refilled my Coke, never even walked past my table. When I'm done eating, I have to wave down Janet again to get my check. He brings it over and I can tell she feels bad about the whole situation. The total was like 18 bucks. Here's where it gets interesting. Janet hands me the check and quietly says, don't worry about tipping Tommy. He didn't earn it tonight and everyone saw what happened. Apparently, this wasn't the first time this kid had pulled this crap. So I pay my $18 cash exact change and leave zero tip as I'm walking.

My daughter Kayla has this rare condition called cleipol file syndrome. Basically, her neck vertebrae are fused together, which means her neck doesn't move like it should and her head sits weird on her shoulders. The doctors explained that if she ever got hurt and someone tried to move her neck the wrong way, she could become paralyzed or worse. When Kayla was 7, we met with this specialist who laid out all the scary scenarios. Accidents, playground falls, sports injuries. Any first responder or doctor who didn't know about her condition might try to stabilize her neck in a way that could permanently damage her spinal cord. The specialist said we needed to make sure medical personnel would know immediately not to manipulate her neck. He recommended getting a medical alert tattoo right on her upper chest. That would be visible even if she was unconscious. At first I thought he was crazy. Tattoo my seven year old. But then he showed me photos of other kids who'd gotten them for similar conditions. They were small, simple, just the basic medical info in clear black letters. The doctor explained that medical jewellery could get lost or removed during trauma care, but a tattoo would always be there. He connected us with a tattoo artist who specialised in medical tattoos and worked with kids. The guy had done hundreds of these procedures and knew exactly how to make it As painless as possible. I talked to Kayla about it, explaining why it was important. She was scared at first, but when I told her it was like getting a special Mark that would keep her safe, she got more interested. The tattoo artist let her pick the font and showed her exactly what it would look like. The actual process took maybe 15 minutes. It was just three lines. Flipple feel syndrome. Do not manipulate neck, and see medical I D. Kayla gripped my hand but didn't cry. The artist gave her stickers afterward and told her she was braver than most adults. He worked on for years. Everything was fine. Kayla's teachers knew about the tattoo, her pediatrician approved of it, and we never had any issues. She actually liked having it because it made her feel special and protected. Then last month, Kayla's school called me to come in for a meeting. I figured it was about her grade.

Sorry for what? She just shakes her head and walks away, disappearing into the crowd of vampires and zombies at our Halloween dance. What the hell was that about? I scanned the dance floor, searching for an explanation. That's when I noticed. Everyone is staring at me. Quick glances that dart away when I make eye contact. A group of sophomores whispering behind their hands. Everyone knows something I don't. I can't even call anyone because my phone's dead. I make my way through the dancing bodies, looking for Tara. Another group goes silent as I pass. Stewart reaches out like he wants to stop me, then pulls his hand back. Has anyone seen Tara? I ask a group near the punch bowl. They exchange looks. One girl's eyes start to water. She just left. Someone finally says, Tara wouldn't leave without me. We came together. We were supposed to leave together. I need to find out what's happening. I marched towards the vice principal standing by the gym entrance, but he sees me coming and actually turns away, pretending to adjust a paper skeleton taped to the wall. Mr. Mulaney? My voice comes out harder than I intend. He won't meet my eyes. Emily, you should. Maybe you should call your parents. My phone's dead. What's going on? It's not my place to say. He clears his throat. Just Go home, please. The way he says these makes my stomach drop. I push through the double doors and to the hallway. The fluorescent lights feel too bright after the dim gymnasium. My footsteps echo as I head toward the parking lot. But I hear crying coming from the girls bathroom. Inside, I found three freshman girls huddled together. When they see me, one of them gasps. What? I asked, clearly fed up. Realization dawns on her for some reason. Oh, my god. You don't know? She whispers. Don't know what? I'm practically shouting now. Somebody posted it on their Instagram story. She holds out her phone with a shaking hand. I reach for it, but another girl yanks her arm back. Don't show her that. Not here. Show me. Before she can, a voice then says my name from the doorway. Emily. It's Missus Walters, the drama teacher. Her face is pale. Come with me. I'll tell you everything. She leads me to her office, closes the door. The silence is suffocating. Sit down, she says gently. I don't want to sit down. I want to know why everyone's treating me like this. There was an incident at your house about two hours ago. My heart stops. The way she said incident makes my blood run cold. Your father, she continues, and suddenly I can't breathe. The police found him in the garage. Dad? My dad who drove me to school this morning. Who reminded me to have fun. Tonight, there was a note on the workbench. Her voice is barely steady. What kind of note? But I already know. Somewhere deep down, I already know. Missus Walters expression shifts, and I see something worse than sadness there. Something like horror. Emily, he's gone. He took his own life this afternoon. The room tilts. No, no, no, no, no. Your mother found him when she got home from work. She's the one who. Missus Walters voice cracks. The paramedics couldn't do anything. He'd been gone for over an hour by the time she got there. I'm shaking my head, backing toward the door. This isn't real. This is a sick Halloween prank note. Missus Walter says, her voice barely a whisper now. Emily, in the note, he confessed. Confessed to what? Her hands are trembling. To hurting children. Multiple children. Over the course of 15 years. The floor drops out from under me. He named them, provided detail.

Another from my sister said, make sure you're already in Phoenix before she figures it out. I called my mom again and this time she answered sounding perfectly calm. Hi, honey. How are my orchids? How's Aunt Carol's surgery going? Oh, fine. She's recovering. That's amazing since she's posting beach photos from Fort Lauderdale. Right now, silence. And I don't know what you're talking about. You destroyed my credit. You stole my identity. I could practically hear her rolling her eyes. Oh, please, we're your parents, not criminals. We gave you life. The least you can do is help us with this little situation. My voice got sharper. Little situation. You put a 340,000 dollar debt in my name. Well, if you hadn't been so selfish about helping family, we wouldn't have had to do it this way. I hung up and immediately called my bank to freeze everything. Then I called the mortgage company and told them about the fraud, but they said without proof, I was still liable. I drove to the police station at 11 at night and filed identity theft charges against my own parents while crying so hard the officer had to write the statement for me. I called 14 lawyers before finding one who'd take the case. While I was googling how to reverse fraudulent deed transfer, at 3:00am, my mom texted me, you're really going to let your parents be homeless over money? We didn't raise you to be this heartless. I screenshot everything, including the emails where they planned this for months. My lawyer filed an emergency injunction and pressed federal charges since they'd crossed state lines. The F B. I got interested fast because apparently parental identity theft was becoming an epidemic. They froze my parents Phoenix condo and all their accounts when the agent showed up at their door. My mom was in the middle of hosting a dinner party with her new neighbours. She called me screaming that I'd embarrassed her in front of everyone. How could you do this to your own mother? I snapped back asking her how she could have done this to her own daughter. And she said, that's different. We're your parents. We have rights to what's ours. I said, I'm not yours anymore and hung up. The next morning, I got a group text from my siblings calling me dramatic and saying I needed to drop the charges because it's not that big of a deal and family doesn't do this to each other. I replied with screenshots of their emails planning the whole thing. They all blocked me. Yesterday, my mom texted asking if I could at least mail her the orchids since I'm keeping everything else that's theirs. I haven't responded yet because honestly, I'm thinking about it. Dead orchids seem like a perfect gift.

I said yes without knowing what I was really signing up for. The call came while I was halfway through a microwave dinner after my third double shift that week. My mom was sobbing about my aunt's emergency heart surgery and they needed to fly out immediately. My brother was supposedly in Singapore and my sister couldn't leave her kids, so of course, it had to be me. My dad showed up at my apartment an hour later, shoving papers in my face while check in his watch packet. Authorization, emergency repairs, just sign here, here, initial, there, our flights in three hours. The last document was a power of attorney and when I hesitated, he grabbed my shoulders. Sweetheart, you're the only one we can trust with this. You've always been there for us. That was true because every family crisis somehow became my responsibility while my siblings lived their lives. I signed everything because that's what I always did. Three days later, I was watering Mom's orchids when the bank called. I'm calling about your overdue mortgage payment. I laughed and said they had the wrong number, but the woman insisted the deed was transferred to your name four days ago and you're four months behind. The phone slipped and shattered on the tile. I could hear her tinny voice saying foreclosure while I stood frozen. I dove for the mail pile and started ripping open every envelope. Final notice after final notice. Four months of threats they've been hiding. My phone exploded with alerts as my credit score plummeted 70 points in real time. A 340,000 dollar mortgage with four missed payments had just destroyed my entire financial future. I called my dad and he didn't answer. I called my mom and it went straight to voicemail. I called my sister and she picked up on the fifth ring. Oh, hey, what's up? Her voice was too casual, too normal. Did you know mom and dad transferred their house to me? There was silence and, and she said, well, it makes sense. You're the responsible one. Then she hung up on me. I ran to their home office and found their computer still logged in. The email on the screen said Phoenix Retirement Plan. And my hands started shaking. They bought a condo in Scottsdale six months ago for cash. They were letting this house go into foreclosure, but under my name, not theirs. An email from my brother said, she's too nice.

My sister called me a bad mom until her kid told me the truth. When Emma asked if she could dye her hair blue for her 13th birthday, I said, sure, it's just hair, right? She'd been begging me for weeks, showing me Pinterest photos of these gorgeous ocean blue highlights at target. We picked out some semi permanent dye that would wash out in a month. She was so excited she could barely sit still while I painted the streaks in our tiny bathroom. The next morning at breakfast, she kept flipping her hair and grinning at herself in the toaster reflection. I made her favorite blueberry pancakes and she kept saying how the blue and her hair match the berries perfectly. honestly the happiest I'd seen her since her dad moved out last year. But when we showed up at my sister Beth's house for Sunday dinner, everything went sideways fast. Beth took one look at Emma and her face just dropped. He pulled me into the kitchen while Emma was playing with her cousins and started going off about how irresponsible I was being. What kind of message does this send, she whispered harshly, gesturing toward the living room. She's going to look like some delinquent at school. I tried explaining it was just temporary hair dye, that Emma was still getting straight A's and playing violin. But Beth wouldn't hear it. She kept shaking her head and muttering About how I was clearly struggling as a single mom and needed to set better boundaries. The whole dinner was awkward after that with Beth making passive aggressive comments about certain parenting choices every time Emma's hair caught the light. When we got home that night, Emma seemed deflated. She kept touching her hair and asking if I thought it looked stupid. I reassured her it looked amazing, but I could tell Beth's reaction had gotten to her. That's when I decided to call my mom to vent about the whole thing. Mom listened patiently while I ranted about Beth being judgmental. Then she got quiet for a moment. Honey, she said carefully, there's something you should probably know about your sister's situation. Apparently, Beth had been calling.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from Accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. A crowd formed to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. Crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space, someone yelled. Laughter erupted. The CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was ex.

So I'm dating Mitchell. He's 56, I'm 28. And, yes, he's rich. Like, really rich. We met at the Starbucks, where I was working on my laptop. He loved that I wasn't trying to get his attention and that I added to my coffee, in his words, more sugar than the Boston Harbor needed in 1773. But here's what six months of dating him actually looks like. Waiters hand him the wine list, never me. His friends, wives talk to me like I'm five, explaining what investment means really slowly. The valley gives Mitchell my car keys every single time. At his country club, someone always asks what I'm studying. I graduated four years ago. Last week, his lawyer asked if I needed help reading the dinner menu. It had seven items on it. Mitchell's company Christmas party is everything I expected and worse. I'm wearing this gorgeous Chanel dress that I bought myself because I liked it, and not even five minutes in, one of the wives pulls me into the bathroom. She puts her hand on my shoulder like she's about to deliver terrible news, and tells me I need to save the money Mitchell gives me for when this ends. When I mention having my own money, she laughs like I've told a joke and presses her friend's financial advisor card into my hand. And he specializes in girls like me, apparently. Mitchell gets pulled into a work Emergency. Leaving me at the bar, where his colleagues don't bother lowering their voices. How much do you think Mitchell spends on her monthly? One says, worth every penny at that age. Another answers, cheaper than my boat maintenance. When I approach and mention my startup work, they find it hilarious. One actually asks if Mitchell taught me the word portfolio. Another suggests I'm confusing shopping with investing. Then the boss himself walks over with his champagne and says the most insulting thing yet. When you and Mitchell are done, you should date my son. He's more age appropriate and needs a pretty girl. I say, I don't need anyone to take care of me, but he just pats my head like I'm a golden retriever. We all know what you need. Heart. I'm about to tell him exactly what I needed in that moment when I hear Mitchell's voice from the conference room. The door is cracked open, and he's on speaker phone, negotiating to buy a tech company. The seller is refusing his 10 million offer, insisting it's worth more, but won't explain why. Mitchell sounds increasingly desperate, repeatedly asking what he's missing. That's when my blood runs cold. I know this company. I know it intimately. I know exactly what Mitchell is missing. I push into the conference room. Before I can stop myself, Mitchell looks up, irritated at the interruption. He tells the seller on the phone, sorry, my girlfriend just wandered in. I'm already scanning the Papers spread across the table, confirming what I suspected. The seller's voice crackles through the speaker, asking what's going on. I state simply that the company has three major clients not listed in the disclosure. Mitchell freezes. The seller's voice turns sharp, demanding to know how I could possibly know that. Mitchell starts apologizing for my intrusion, while the CEO appears in the doorway. Mitchell, that's confidential information. You shouldn't be sharing these things. His wife laughs, suggesting I overheard something, and I'm trying to sound smart, but I continue.

Three years later, she became my boss. I never plan to anonymously fund a stranger's wedding. But sitting in that coffee shop three years ago, I couldn't ignore the heartbreak happening at the table next to me. She was maybe 28, professionally dressed, quietly sobbing into her phone while trying not to draw attention. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but her words cut through the ambient noise. Mom, the venue just called. They're canceling our reservation unless we pay the remaining $8,000 by tomorrow morning. Her voice cracked. The wedding is in three weeks. We, we've already paid $12,000, but they won't budge. I watched her listen, then shake her head. No, mom, you can't take out another loan. Your house is already. She wiped her eyes. We'll just postpone maybe next year. As she hung up, I noticed the engagement ring on her finger. Paid her modest but beautiful. She stared at it, shoulders slumped into feet before opening her laptop and typing affordable wedding venues last minute into the search bar. I come from money, not I earned it money, but my grandparents were smart investors. Money. I've always felt uncomfortable with my financial privilege, especially since I've done nothing to deserve it beyond being born into the right family. That day, I made a split second decision. I waited until she stepped away to use the rest room, then approached the barista. Part a Friend who knew the woman as a regular customer. Her wedding venue was about to cancel. Can you help me pay it anonymously? Twenty minutes and one phone call later, I transferred $8,500 to the venue, put on covering the balance plus a little extra for unexpected costs. The barista agreed to tell her only that someone who overheard wanted you to have your perfect day. I left before she returned, never expecting to see her again. Fast forward 3 years. I've been working at a marketing firm for 2 years. When our department director left unexpectedly, the CEO called an all hands meeting to introduce our new boss. Please welcome Jennifer Lawson, joining us from Cooper and Mitchell. The moment she walked in, I recognized her immediately. Pan the woman from the coffee shop. She looked different now, confident, polished with a wedding band.

I was the only night keeper at our aquarium who could handle Poseidon, our four million dollar giant Pacific octopus. And that evening he wrapped all eight arms around my forearm to gently pull crab from my beating tongues. His massive 200 pound body moved with surprising Grace through the crystal clear water of his tank. But when any other keeper approached, the same gentle creature became a destructive nightmare that sprayed black ink everywhere and destroyed thousands of dollars it's worth of equipment. Our new operations director Caroline watched from the observation deck with her arms crossed, clearly unimpressed by what she called my animal dependency problem during yesterday's staff meeting. She believed every creature should have multiple handlers because no single employee should be irreplaceable, especially not because of some oversized sea creature that cost more than most people's houses. Caroline had spent three weeks documenting every minor violation she could manage. Manufacturer writing me up for wearing a different brand of reef safe sunscreen than the one corporate required even though their brand gave me hives and docking my pay. When Poseidon's complex eating routine ran five minutes over my scheduled break, her masterpiece was hiring Tim, her former assistant manager who spent entire shifts taking Instagram selfies near the shark tank and had never worked with cephalopods in his 24 years of existence. Poseidon hated Tim with a burning intensity of a thousand suns shooting Pressurized water jets that soaked him completely whenever he approached the tank. And once Tim slipped so dramatically on the wet observation deck that he crashed through a three thousand dollar interactive display about octopus intelligence. Tim's solution was to stand 15 feet away from the tank and throw food pellets like he was feeding pigeons at the park, which made Poseidon retreat to his cave and refuse to eat for two entire days. Then disaster struck on Wednesday evening when major marine research donors were arriving for a private feeding demonstration at 8:30, specifically to see our famous octopus interact with his primary caregiver. Twenty minutes before the VIP tour, Caroline cornered me in the equipment room while I prepared Poseidon's dinner of fresh dungeness crab and puzzle feeders. Tim will handle tonight's demonstration, she announced with fake authority dripping from every word. You're needed in the children's touch tank area for deep cleaning duties. Everyone in that equipment room knew exactly what would happen if Tim approached Poseidon during feeding time, when the octopus was most territorial and aggressive. But I looked Caroline directly in the eyes and explained the obvious anyway. Poseidon won't accept food from Tim and he becomes violent when strangers approach during his dinner routine. Caroline snapped back that we'd manage without the feeding demonstration and gave me a direct order to report to the children's area immediately or face consequences. I slowly unclipped my security badge and identification card, placing both items On the stainless steel prep counter. While our senior aquarist and two night staff members watched this confrontation unfold in stunned silence, I pulled out my phone to start recording and told Caroline that the sighting was in full hunting mode because it was feeding time and Tim knew where all the equipment was stored. Caroline's face turned bright red when she realized I was documenting our conversation for legal. If you walk out of this building, you're terminated immediately and permanently. I replied calmly that this was perfectly fine with me, already hearing Poseidon's agitated flashing echoing from the deep sea exhibit rooms away. I'm recording this for unemployment documentation since you're firing me for refusing to endanger a four million dollar animal and potentially injure your completely inexperienced employee. I walked out of the building and barely made it to the parking lot before my phone started buzzing with frantic calls and text messages. Twelve missed calls came in during the first four minutes, starting with panicked messages from our senior Aquarius describing how Poseidon had grabbed Tim's entire arm through the feeding slot and refused to let go no matter.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggs bells around her mood swings. Year 1 was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids'grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I've forgotten how To enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught sky to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and be being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from in the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for.

No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year 1 was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. His grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake, cook, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and be being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three Years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from in the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for.

I had sworn I would never talk to my little sister Mia again, not after she picked that scumbag, Blake, over our entire family. For 2 whole years, I stuck to my word like it was carved in stone. Blake was the guy who got our cousin Jenny hooked on pills. He would sell them to her behind the school, then act all innocent when she overdosed in the bathroom during homecoming. Annie barely survived and our whole family watched her go through hell trying to get clean. when I tried to warn Mia about what kind of person Blake really was, she laughed in my face. You're just jealous I have someone. She, I said, you can't stand seeing me happy for once. That was the night I told her if she stayed with him, she was dead to me. She chose him. So I chose to forget I had a sister. For 2 years, I never called, never texted, never checked her Instagram or asked our parents how she was doing. When people brought her up, I would literally walk away. I told everyone, including our mom, I, I don't care if she's dying, I'm never talking to her again. My friends thought I was being dramatic. My parents kept begging me to reach out. But I had made a promise to myself and I was going to keep it no matter what. Then last Tuesday around midnight, Someone started pounding on my apartment door like the building was on fire. When, when I opened it, this dirty, sweating mess of a man pushed right past me into my living room. I recognized him instantly, Blake. He looked like he hadn't slept in days. His clothes were torn up. His hair was greasy. And he kept looking over his shoulder like someone was chasing him. That's when I noticed the kitchen knife tucked into his waistband. I need a place to hide, he said, pacing around my couch like a caged animal.

So my whole family had been using my Amazon Prime account for like three years. My mom, my sister Ashley, my Uncle Rick. Even my grandma somehow figured out how to order stuff. I was paying for it because I actually use Amazon all the time for work stuff and groceries, but they were just leeching off it. The breaking point happened two weeks ago. I check my account and see 17 packages coming to different addresses. 17! My sister ordered a whole workout set she'll never use. My mom got some fancy face cream that cost 60 bucks, and my Uncle Rick ordered a drone he definitely doesn't need. But the worst part was my cousin Blake ordered a gaming chair that cost $400. I called Blake and asked him what the hell he was thinking. He just laughed and said it's not his problem. I gave everyone access. He said if I didn't want people using it, I shouldn't have shared the password. This kid just graduated high school and acts like he runs the world. So I called my mum and told her everyone needed to chip in for prime or get their own accounts. She got all dramatic and said family should help each other out. She reminded me how she used to buy me clothes when I was younger. I told her that was literally her job as a parent and not the same thing at all. Then Ashley calls me crying, saying she can't afford her own prime account because she's saving for a wedding. I reminded her that her wedding is in two years and she just spent $300 on workout clothes she returned last month. She said I was being petty and that it's only like $10 a month split between everyone. I did the math. If everyone chipped in 10 bucks, that would actually cover prime and give me extra money. But when I suggested this in our family group chat, suddenly everyone had excuses. My mom said she's on a fixed income. Ashley said she's saving for the wedding. Rick said he barely uses it anyway, which is a lie because he ordered protein powder just yesterday. The final straw was when my grandma called me, confused about why her soap order got cancelled. Turns out my account got flagged for fishes activity. Because there were so many different addresses, Amazon temporarily locked my account and I couldn't order my medication refills. That's when I snapped. I changed the password and removed everyone's.

My boyfriend brought his new coworker Dave to our housewarming party last weekend. I have a 13 year old beagle named Murphy who's blind in one eye from an accident years ago and moves pretty slowly these days. He's the sweetest old guy. Never bothers anyone, just likes to find a cozy spot and watch the world go by. I'd invited about 20 people over to show off our new lace. Everyone was having a great time, music playing, people mingling between the kitchen and living room. Murphy had claimed his usual spot by the fireplace, occasionally getting gentle pets from guests who thought he was adorable. About an hour into the party, I realized I hadn't seen Murphy in a while. That's unusual because he never wanders far from wherever the action is. Started looking around, calling his name softly so I wouldn't alarm anyone. Finally found him locked in the laundry room, whimpering and scratching at the door. The moment I opened it, he practically collapsed into my arms. When I helped him stand, he was limping badly on his back right leg. My heart immediately started racing. Murphy's old and fragile. Any injury could be serious. I carried him back to the living room and asked everyone what happened, trying to keep my voice calm, but probably failing. Most of my guests looked genuinely concerned and confused. A few people mentioned seeing Him earlier, but nothing seemed wrong. That's when Dave, who'd been standing by the beer cooler looking completely unbothered, started laughing. Oh yeah, that old dog kept getting in my way while I was grabbing another beer, he said casually, like he was talking about the weather. Kept bumping into my legs, so I gave him a little kick to move him along. No big deal. The entire room went silent. I stared at him in complete shock, not sure I'd heard correctly. You kicked my 13 year old blind dog? I asked, my voice probably getting louder than I intended. Dave just shrugged with this annoying smirk. Barely touched him. He's fine. Obviously dogs need to learn boundaries anyway. Can't just let them walk all over you. My boyfriend's face went completely pale, and he immediately started apologizing, clearly mortified. But I was already seeing red. Murphy was now hiding behind my legs, trembling and refusing to put weight on his injured paw. Everyone needs to leave right now, I announced to the room. Everyone except you. I pointed directly at Dave. You're staying to explain this to someone special. My guests filed out quickly, many of them shooting disgusted looks at Dave and offering to help with Murphy. My boyfriend hesitated, but I told him he needed to leave too, and think about the kind and of people he brings around. Once the house cleared, I called my neighbor Jim. He's a retired police officer who absolutely adores Murphy and has a spare key to check on him when I travel for work. Jim treats Murphy like his own grand dog. Jim arrived within five minutes. Still in his week

I responded, bros before hoes, but moms before all. And everyone cracked up. Jason didn't smile, though. His face drained of color, like I just confessed to murder. He grabbed all his stuff and moved three rows up the school bus without a word. Jason, what's wrong? I was just kidding. I called after him, but he wouldn't turn around. That's when I heard it. Casey, my girlfriend's best friend, was crying her eyes out in the back row. When I turned to look, her friend whispered urgently in her ear, and she glanced at me before crying harder. Okay, that was definitely weird. I started to wonder whether my joke was really that offensive. That's when my phone buzzed. Three missed calls from dad, but there was no signal. And at the red light, I caught the bus driver wiping his eyes in the rearview mirror. In my three years of knowing him, the most emotion he'd shown was mild annoyance when kids left trash on the seats. A cold feeling crept into my stomach. I got up to go talk to Jason, but missus unfit Harris blocked the aisle. Sit down. We're moving. I just need to sit down. I'd never heard her voice like that. I sat, but the second we got to the destination, I cornered Jason. Dude, what is going on? He backed away. Nothing. I just. I need space. Bro, I was just kidding. I don't know if I'd pick my mom or my girlfriend. Why did you have to tell everyone what I said? Sid appeared out of nowhere and pulled me aside. Our team captain, who never said more than pass the ball all to me, grabbed my shoulders. Bro, if you need to talk about anything, I'm here. About what? I was almost shouting. Now he just squeezed my shoulder and walked away. That cold feeling in my stomach was spreading. During the water break, Ryan shuffled over. This kid didn't even know my name. Oh, the blonde Kaylee from volleyball thinks you're cute. She's single now, too. The words hit like a punch. Dude, what the hell? I flashed him my lock screen. I have a girlfriend. His face went white. Just trying to help you move forward, man. Move forward from what? He practically ran away. I tried calling my girlfriend Isabella on the public landline. Right then straight to voicemail. I must have called 15 times. I was losing my mind. Everyone felt so bad for me that no one even forced me back on the field to play. As soon as lunch hit, I grabbed Jason more aggressively this time. Tell me what's happening now. Now! I can't. He was typing frantically in his notes app. You can't or you won't? His girlfriend Ava, read over his shoulder, then slapped him hard. How Could you not tell him, you coward? She stormed off. Jason did. Something happened to Isabella. He wouldn't look at me, just kept typing. That's when Stacy walked by. She saw me and her face twisted with rage. You never deserved a girl like you, Isabella. I always told her she deserved better. Her friend clamped a hand over her mouth and dragged her away. My head was spinning. I stumbled to the vending machines where the coaches were arguing. He has a right to know now, Mrs. Griffin hissed. There's no point. The decision has already been made. Mrs. Fitzharris shot back. Somebody tell me what's happening! I shouted. They scattered like roaches. It wasn't until the bus ride back that Jason spoke to me again. By that point, I was so sick of everyone's BS that I just wanted to show him the Minecraft base I've been working on. We were ten minutes away from the

With his phone charged and ready, right on schedule, Rick emerged from his house at two PM, looked around to make sure no one was watching, walked over to our porch. With that same casual stride he perfected over months of systematic theft, dad hit record as Rick grabbed the package and headed back to his house. This time, dad actually followed him outside, filming from across the street as Rick disappeared through his front door with what he thought was another free prize. We waited inside. Dad kept checking his watch. Mom asked what was happening, but dad just held up one finger and smiled. About 20 minutes later, we heard, heard this blood curdling scream from Rick's house. Then another one, then what sounded like furniture being thrown around and someone having a complete meltdown. Dad was grinning like it was Christmas morning. Five minutes after that, Rick's front door flew open and he stumbled out looking like he'd been attacked by a craft store explosion. Bright rainbow glitter covered every inch of him. He looked absolutely ridiculous, like a very angry, very sparkly unicorn who'd lost a fight with a party supply store. That's when Dad's real masterpiece revealed itself. Two official vehicles pulled up to Rick's house. United States Postal Inspection Service agents got out with handcuffs and evidence bags. Turns out dad had been coordinating with them for weeks. The glitter explosion wasn't just petty revenge. It was the final piece of evidence they Needed to catch Rick in the act and build an airtight federal case against him. They arrested him right there in his driveway while he was still sparkling like a human disco ball.

My dad caught our neighbor stealing packages off our porch but didn't say a word to anyone about it for months. This has been going on since we moved to the neighborhood. We'd get delivery notifications but find nothing at our door. My mom kept complaining to Amazon about missing packages, filing reports, getting refunds. The neighbor was smart about it, too. Rick, who worked from home and had perfected his technique. He'd wait exactly 15 minutes after the delivery truck left, then casually stroll over like he was checking his own mail, grab our stuff and head back inside like nothing happened. Dad started keeping a notebook, times, dates, what got stolen. Mom thought he was being obsessive, but he had a plan brewing. He started ordering worthless junk online just to mess with Rick. Expired vitamins from sketchy websites, broken phone accessories that didn't work, random magazines about hobbies nobody cares about. Stuff that cost almost nothing but came in official looking packages that would bull a thief. Every few days, another decoy package would arrive. Rick kept taking them like clockwork, probably thinking he'd hit the Jackpot. With neighbors who ordered so much stuff, dad would place the order and wait by the window with his notebook. This went on for three weeks. Dad was building something but wouldn't tell us what. Then dad escalated phase 2. He found this website that sells glitter packages specifically designed For pranking, package thieves ordered the biggest one they had, the kind that explodes rainbow glitter everywhere when someone opens it. The description promised it would take weeks to clean up. But he also made a phone call. Turns out his college roommate, Tom, works for the United States Postal Inspection Service. Dad had been documenting everything for weeks, times, dates, photos through the window, even video footage of Rick's theft routine. Stealing mail is a federal crime and Tom explained they'd been looking for solid evidence against repeat offenders in our area. Dad had basically built them a perfect case without realizing it.

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos and that smug smile that made me wanna run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, Nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of.

When I'd try to wear him down with endless tasks, he just say, what's Next, sir, one Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck.

You were right. It's such a beautiful name. I stood there holding wilted flowers, 38 weeks pregnant with my own daughter, watching my sister cuddle the baby who now had my name. The name I'd planned for almost a decade. Tyler was taking pictures, the nurses were cooing, and I felt like I was watching my dreams get stolen in real time. Emma. That was my name, I whispered. She looked at me with fake confusion. What do you mean? We never decided on anything official, and she just looked like a Sophia when she came out. You understand, right? You'll find something even better. I left that hospital room crying so hard I could barely see to drive. My husband Jake, was furious. When I told him, she can't just steal your name, he kept saying, but legally, she absolutely could. There's no copyright on baby names. Two weeks later, I gave birth to my own perfect daughter. As I held her in the delivery room, looking at her tiny, perfect face, I knew exactly what her name should be. Not some backup option, not second choice. Something that would remind my sister every single day of what she'd done. I named my daughter Emma Rose. Every family gathering now is absolutely hilarious. Emma, can you pass the salt? Oh, wait. Which Emma? Emma needs her diaper changed. Big Emma or little Emma? Emma's crying. The baby or the sister? My sister can't complain because that would Mean admitting she stole my name first. He gets visibly annoyed every time someone has to clarify which Emma they're talking about. At my daughter's first birthday party, three different relatives accidentally wished happy birthday Emma to my sister instead of my baby. The best part is my little Emma is already showing signs of being the favorite grandchild. She's smiley, sleeps well, and doesn't scream during family photos like her cousin Sophia does. My mom keeps saying things like Emma is such a good baby while bouncing my daughter and my sister's face turns red every time. Last week at Sunday dinner, my dad was playing with little Emma and said, this Emma is definitely the best Emma in the family. My sister got so mad she left early.

She needs it more. Cousins cheered. Dad smiled, sis fake tears. I raised my glass, read a bank message and every fork dropped. I never thought my own birthday would feel like a setup. But the second my mom tapped her wine glass and cleared her throat, I felt the trap snap shut. Table went quiet. Balloons sagged against the ceiling. The cake sat untouched on the counter and I braced myself. We all agree Evan should sell his house and give the money to your sister's baby fund, my mom announced, voice cheery but sharp. She needs it more. Laughter, applause, clinking glasses, not nervous laughter, the kind that says he'll cave. I stared at her, at them. My cousins clapping like seals. My dad raising his glass like he was proud. My sister dabbing at fake tears, whispering thank you like she was already cashing the check. Heat crawled up my neck. Who does this? Who stages and ambush with wine and balloons? Don't you think it's time you did something for the family, mom pressed. Your sister's baby needs a proper home. You live alone. It's not like you need all that space. That hit like a slap. I live alone because I like peace as I worked myself raw to build it. But to them, I'm just an ATM with a roof. Aunt leaned in syrupy. Voice, think of it as your gift to the next generation, a blessing. Every eye pinned me. My glass shook in my hand. My sister sniffled, I can't believe you'd even hesitate. Matt lost his job. We're barely making rent. You're comfortable. This would change everything for us. Comfortable as if I hadn't eaten noodles for a year to scrape my down payment together. As if overtime and skip vacations were luck. My dad grinned. You're the man now. Step up. Do right by your family. And suddenly, I saw it. This wasn't a suggestion. It was an intervention. They'd chosen my birthday as the stage for my public shaming. The air was heavy, charged. My chest was tight. I didn't move. I didn't shout. Instead, I unlocked my phone. I actually got some news this morning, I said, standing. My mom's smile widened. My sister straightened the room, leaned in. I cleared my throat and read, the bank is confirming the transfer of funds you requested has been completed. Full amount, $428,000. Your mortgage has been paid off in full and your house deed will be mailed to you within 5 business days. Silence. Utter, total silence. My mom's smile froze, brittle. My sister's tears evaporated. My dad coughed into his glass, nearly choking. Forks hovered midair like suspended weapons. I let it hang, let them feel it. My house free and clear, mine untouchable. You're asking me to sell something that's now completely mine, I said evenly, nearly Half a million dollars because you what, took a vote when I wasn't in the room? No one spoke. Even the kids in the living room went quiet. Finally, mom recovered.

What's the most insane thing you ever experienced? When I was 10, I got placed with the lanes. They seemed normal at first. Nice house, good food. Even gave me my own bedroom with cartoon wallpaper. But something felt weird from day one. They never let me go outside alone, not even to the mailbox. If I wanted to play in the backyard, one of them had to watch me through the window. When I asked why, they said it was for my safety. I figured all foster parents were protective like that. At school, if I got any papers or notes, I had to hand them over the second I walked in the door. They said they needed to check everything for my own good. They locked up my backpack at night and went through it while I slept. I thought this was normal, too. The weirdest thing was the computer. They had one in the living room, but I wasn't allowed to touch it. Ever. They said the internet was dangerous for kids. When other kids at school talked about games or videos they saw online, I just nodded along and pretended I knew what they meant. One night, I lost a tooth. I put it under my pillow like always, expecting to wake up to a dollar or some quarters. Instead, I found a tiny folded note written in handwriting I'd never seen before. It said, you're not who they think you are. Check behind The mirror I scared out of my mind. At school the next day, I asked my teacher, Missus Kim, if the tooth Fairy ever left notes instead of money. She laughed and said, no, the tooth fairy only brings coins. That made me even more confused. That night, while the lanes were downstairs watching their usual cop shows, I carefully pulled the mirror off my bedroom wall. My hands were shaking the whole time. Behind it was a small hole cut into the wall, and inside was a plastic bag stuffed with papers. Pulled everything out. Birth certificates, newspaper clippings, photos of kids who looked like me but weren't me. One photo showed a little girl with my exact eyes, but different hair. Another showed a teenager who could have been my sister. And I found the missing child flyer. It had a picture of a six year old girl named Sophie Blanchard, missing for four years. The girl in the photo looked exactly like me, just younger. My stomach dropped to the floor. There were handwritten notes, too. They rename all the kids. Tell someone the truth. Call Aunt Jane. She's still looking. I spent the next week acting totally normal, eating dinner and doing homework like nothing happened. But inside, I was freaking out. During lunch at school, I snuck into the classroom and used the phone to call the number written on one of the papers. A woman answered, and when I said the name Sophie Blanchard, She started crying so hard, I could barely understand her. She kept asking where I was, if I was safe, if I remembered her. I hung up because I got scared. That weekend, two people from child services showed up at our door without warning. The lanes tried to act calm, saying it must be some kind of mistake. But the officers found more

Dad finally signed the house over to me. You'll get nothing, my mom smiled. It's what's fair, I shrugged. Cool. Just know you'll be getting an eviction notice since I'm the landlord. The grill stopped sizzling. Everyone froze. My uncle dropped his beer. My cousin's kids stopped running. Even the neighbor leaning over the fence went quiet. Claire's smile faltered. What the house, I said. Take in a bite of my burger. I own it, have for two years. Growing up, I was the family disappointment. Claire got straight A's, captain of the debate team, full ride to Yale, married a lawyer named Brad, gave them two perfect grandkids. I barely graduated high school, moved to Nevada at 19, worked construction, then got into equipment rental. Nobody asked what I did. They assumed I was broke. Every Thanksgiving, every Christmas, every summer barbecue, I'd hear the same thing. This house will be cleared someday, mom would pat her hand. All of this, sweetie, you've earned it. I stopped coming home. For a while, it was easier, but I never stopped paying attention. Three years ago, I noticed dad looked tired. Not just old, tired, stressed, tired. His hands shook when he poured coffee. Mom snapped at him more. I didn't ask. We weren't that kind of family. Then one night my phone rang at 2:00am. Dad's name lit up a screen. Hello? Heavy breathing, background noise, a bar. Maybe your mother's driving me. Insane about this house transfer. He was drunk. I could hear it in every word. Okay. Claire keeps asking when we're signing it over every damn week. When's the house mine? When's the house mine? I waited. Thing is, his voice cracked. Property taxes tripled. Some rezoning thing. We're drowning. Second mortgage, credit cards maxed. Your mother doesn't even know half of it. I sat up in bed. If I give Claire the house, she'll see theleans, the tax bills. She'll know we're broke. She'll be furious we didn't tell her. I could hear him crying now. My dad, who never showed emotion. And if we don't give it to her, she'll never forgive us. Your mother's already promised it her a thousand times. How much do you owe? Silence, dad. How much? 240,000, give or take. I did the math in my head. I just sold my third rental property. Business was good, really good. What if I bought it? What? The house?

I was walking home from my friend's place around eleven PM when I heard this loud pop behind me, like someone slapping their hands together really hard. I felt something slam into my lower back and stumbled forward a few steps. My whole side went numb for a second. I turned around expecting to see some kid who threw a rock at me or something. Street was empty, just parked cars and dim streetlights. I reached back and touched where it hurt. No blood, just this weird tender spot near my hip. Felt like someone punched me really hard. So I kept walking. What else was I gonna do? Call the cops because my back hurt. I figured maybe a piece of metal fell off a truck or someone was shooting BB guns from their window. Happens in my neighborhood sometimes. The next morning I woke up and could barely roll over. The pain was way worse, like a constant throbbing that got sharper when I moved. I pressed on it and nearly jumped out of bed. Something was definitely wrong. My mom said I should go to urgent care. She dropped me off at this clinic near our house. The waiting room smelled like bleach and had those plastic chairs that stick to your legs. I sat there for like an hour watching some cooking show on the TV when they finally called Me back. This doctor barely looked at me. Young guy with messy hair who seemed like he'd rather be anywhere else. I told him what happened. He had me lift my shirt and just poked around the area for maybe 30 seconds. Probably just a bruise, he said. Already reaching for his prescription pad. Maybe pulled a muscle when you stumbled. These things happen. Just ignore it and it'll go away in a few days. I asked if he wanted to do an X ray or something. He actually laughed. For a bruise, that's a waste of time and money. Trust me, I've seen this 1,000 times. Take some ibuprofen and you'll be fine. So I left with a bottle of painkillers and this stupid feeling that he didn't take me seriously. The pain got worse that night, way worse. I couldn't sleep on my left side at all. Even sitting up in bed made me want to scream. My cousin Jerome came over the next day and saw me hobbling around like an old man. Dude, you look terrible. Something's really wrong. He kept bugging me to go to the hospital, the real hospital, not some urgent care place. By day 3, I gave in. The emergency room was packed, but they got me in pretty quick. When I described the pain, this nurse, older lady with kind eyes, actually listened. When I told her what happened. She nodded and said they needed to do some imaging. The X Ray tech was this chatty guy who kept cracking jokes while he positioned me on the table. Hold still now. Don't want any blurry pictures. He disappeared behind his lead wall and I heard the machine buzz. Then everything went quiet, way too quiet. The tech came back and stared at his computer screen for a long time. His smile was completely gone. Um, let me get the doctor. Three people rushed into the room. The er doctor looked at the screen and her face went white. Sir, when did you say?

My fiance told me in front of everyone. I ended things on the spot and said, thanks for making this easy. I run K9 Search and rescue with my German Shepherd, shadow. My fiance, Vanessa, worked in tech marketing, always polished, always concerned about appearances. We've been together two years, engaged since last winter. The fundraiser was at the recreation center to raise money for new dog kennels. Whole town turned out. Vanessa worked the front table taking donations like she was hosting a talk show. I was running demonstrations with shadow. During the break, this friendly older donor came up and asked how long Vanessa and I had been together. When I said two years, he grinned and asked, so when do we get little ones running around? You'd make a great dad. I smiled and said, maybe someday. Just normal small talk. Nessa was standing right next to me. She laughed, not normal, but sharp and cutting. Then she said loud enough for everyone to hear. Kids with Jack's job, I'm not signing up to raise someone else's mutts or risk having my own. With those priorities or those gene, the whole place went quiet. Even the dogs stopped barking. The donor walked away like his shoes were on fire. My teammates froze. I just looked at Vanessa calmly and said, thanks for making this easy. What's that supposed to mean? The engagements over? Grab your things when You want locks changed? Night I picked up Shadow's leash and walked outside. Behind me, people started whispering. Next morning, I changed all the locks and documented everything she'd left behind. But Vanessa wasn't done. She was furious that I'd embarrassed her publicly and she decided to destroy my reputation. Within days, anonymous complaints started hitting the city about our facility, noise violations, animal mistreatment claims, all from brand new accounts using public Wi-Fi from the co working space where Vanessa rented an office. Then came the blog articles, questions raised about rescue center practices, photos taken out of context, anonymous sources claiming.

No solo eran pegajosas al tacto, sino que también desprendían un olor peculiar, como una mezcla de leche de coco y mermelada. Eso me hizo sentir que el fin del mundo se acercaba. Decidí construir un refugio subterráneo para proteger a mi familia cuando llegara el día del juicio. Hace solo tres días. Mientras trabajaba en la obra, escuché un fuerte trueno. Al mirar el cielo, vi bandadas de cuervos cubriéndolo por completo. Lo extraño era que solo yo podía verlos. Mis compañeros no vieron nada, ni siquiera oyeron el trueno. Después de eso, comencé a tener pesadillas sobre tormenta. Con el tiempo, mi estado mental se deterioró. Cada día estaba más convencido de que el apocalipsis era inminente. Después de prepararme mentalmente, decidí con beatie el sótano del patio en en refugio. Tras hacer algunos cálculos, descubrí que el proyecto costaría más de sesenta mil. Sabía que no podría convencer a mi esposa, así que resolví mantenerlo en secreto y empezar a ahorrar para el proyecto. Cuando regresé a casa, hija mirando a través de la ventana a una figura misteriosa. Asustado, la tomé en brazos y me aparté, pero la figura no se marchó. En cambio, comenzó a golpear la puerta con tanta fuerza que toda la casa tembló. El siguiente momento fue aún más extraño. Todos los muebles empezaron a flotar en el aire, dándome cuenta solo era otra pesadilla Al ver la mancha húmeda en la cama supe que no podía esperar más. Decidí empezar a construir el refugio de inmediato. Al día siguiente pedí un préstamo en secreto sin que mi esposa lo supiera y fui a la ferretería a comprar máscaras antigás. Luego llevé mi hija al supermercado para almacenar comida no perecedera. evitar sospecha, guardé todo en el refugio. Sin decir nada. de semana soborné a compañero para que condujera una excavadora hasta mi patio. Cavamos un hoyo de casi diez metros de profundidad junto al sótano y bajamos un contenedor de transporte dentro. Justo entonces mi esposa regresó a casa. lo que hacía, se enfureció, convencida de que estaba actuando sin sentido. No intenté explicarlo. De todos modos, nadie me creería. Esa noche comencé a tener convulsiones violentas. Mi esposa despertó alarmada e intentó pedir ayuda, pero la detuve soportando el dolor para no preocuparla más. Le confesé todo lo que había visto en mi sueño, cada detalle. No sabía me estaba volviendo loco o si el fin realmente estaba cerca, pero mi único deber era proteger a mi familia. Un día vi a mi hija correr hacia la carretera. Corrí para alcanzarla y repente una nube de murciélagos se abalanzó sobre nosotros. Otra pesadilla, pero esta vez no desperté por mi cuenta.

They don't realize they should feed him milk. They try offering fruit, but the baby won't eat it. Then they try coconut water, almost choking him in the process. Amy watches the baby cry. As a first time mother, she has no idea what to do. She picks him up, trying to soothe him, when suddenly the baby nuzzles against her chest, finds her nipple and begins nursing hungrily. The two are surprised to learn newborns survive on milk alone. At first, Charlie struggled to accept this new life, but as time passed, he grew to adore the child. He even joined Amy in teaching him to swim. On this deserted island, swimming wasn't just a skill, it was essential for survival. The child didn't disappoint them. Soon he was swimming freely through the sea. And so under their care, the child grew up little by little. Though born on a deserted island, his childhood was surprisingly rich. Coconut shells became toy boats. Sea turtles turned into rides. Of course, sports weren't forgotten. Charlie taught him baseball, but nothing beat playing in the MUD. While they were enjoying themselves, a sailboat approached the island. The old man aboard was searching for his son lost at sea long ago. The child spotted the sailboat. Charlie looked over, nearly shouting with excitement. But after a glance at Amy, both hesitated. A brief silence fell between them and they Instantly understood each other's thoughts, they quietly LED the child away from the shore. Their retreat made the old man think it couldn't be his son, so he ordered the crew to search elsewhere. One day, Charlie took his family to a nearby island to pick bananas, asked Amy and the child to wait by the shore while he went alone to gather fruit. What Charlie didn't know was that this decision would lead them into danger. Soon after he left, the child spotted bright red wild berries. Curious, he picked a few and placed them in the boat while Amy wasn't looking. Amy noticed the wind picking up and brought the child into the boat to rest. While she dozed off, the Kyle accidentally knocked in or into the sea. Amy woke with a start. At first, she didn't grasp the danger. She only thought of retrieving the oar and paddling back quickly. But after several failed attempts, he had to call for Charlie's help. Charlie heard her and rushed over, diving into the water to grab the oar. Just then, Amy's face filled with horror. A shark was swimming straight toward him. To help Charlie escape, Amy threw the other oar toward him. Though Charlie was saved, losing their last were made their situation even more dangerous. Frustrated by its lost meal, the shark began circling the small boat. Charlie didn't want to stay trapped, swam desperately toward the oar, but the current carried them further and further. Away. After a while, Charlie realized in despair they would never make it back to shore. Helpless, the two watched the sunset together. The next morning, Amy woke to a horrifying sight. The hungry child was eating the poisonous berries. She tried to make him spit them out, but he had already swallowed them. Soon, the poison took effect. Amy knew the child didn't have much time left. Seeing this, Charlie wasn't just sad. He picked the remaining berries and divided them into two portions. At first, Amy didn't understand, but when she saw the look in Charlie's eyes, she knew what he meant. She took the other portion and they ate the berries together then, and they held each other close, waiting for the end. Sometime later, the sailboat from before discovered the small boat. They found three people lying inside. The old man still didn't realize this was his own descendant. They're dead. No, sir. They're asleep.

She cried every day, sitting before an old bucket in despair. The family was so poor, the children had no pants to wear, using wooden barrels to cover their bodies as clothes. Inside the house, the walls were bare. Everything lay in ruins. Even the fish in the tank was so starved, only bones remained. When the woman opened the cupboard, there was just one plate and a single red bean, the only food for more than 20 people. Just then, dark clouds gathered overhead. The children rushed to the dining table, ready to eat. The woman was about to drop the red bean into the pot to cook and share among them, when one child stopped her, said he wanted to plant it instead. He carried the red bean into the yard, dug a hole with a shovel, buried it, covered it with soil and watered it. Soon the ground began to swell. A red bean vine sprouted, growing taller and taller, reaching high above the clouds. The boy grabbed the vine, said goodbye to his mother, and climbed upward until he reached the sky. In the distance, he saw a giant weighing over 500 pounds. The boy hid in the clouds, watching as the giant bathed, using the clouds like a shower. After bathing, the giant returned to his palace. He pulled a spring with all his might, and an iron ball shot out like A bowling ball lamps in the house lit up as it rolled into a hole, unlocking the gate to the sky castle. Once the giant entered, the boy followed the iron ball's path and slipped inside. In the palace, the giant walked slowly toward the golden egg production room. He grabbed the hen by the neck, looked under her, but found no egg. After a few slaps, the hen explained she was on her period and couldn't lay. The giant pulled her wings. Six cherries appeared in the hen's eyes, and a pile of giant golden eggs rolled out. The giant placed them under a cutting machine. Each golden egg was sliced into fragments, then stored inside a safe. After the giant left, the boy jumped down from the window, signaled the hen to stay quiet, picked her up, and prepared to escape. The giant heard the doorbell, dropped the safe, and chased after the chicken thief. In the end, the giant caught the boy, but the hen pulled out a large hammer and struck the giant hard on the head. Seizing the chance, the boy escaped with the hen. The giant chased them out of the palace. The hen hit him again with the hammer, knocking him down. The boy slid quickly down the vine back to the ground, the giant still in pursuit. Once on the ground, the boy in the hen grabbed an axe and chopped the vine. The giant fell crashing into the earth with a Huge impact leaving a massive crater and died instantly. Boy hugged the hen and returned to his mother. Then the hen laid a giant golden egg. The mother was overjoyed. They traded their worn out shoe house for a crystal shoe house and all the children rushed into their new home. The refrigerator replaced the old cupboard and inside was an endless supply of food.

But what hatched wasn't a chick. It was a baby Dinosaur. Still, the hen raised him as her own. The Newborn Dinosaur was hungry, so hungry it swallowed all the straw in the coop. In an instant, it grew several times larger, bursting straight through the roof. After that, the hen took the Dinosaur outside and taught him to hunt for insects. The Dinosaur mimicked her movements, digging eagerly for food, but mistook tree roots for bugs and swallowed an entire tree in one gulp. Again, he grew larger than before, now big enough to act like an umbrella, sheltering the chickens from the rain. The more the Dinosaur ate, the bigger he grew, until he finally broke the farmhouse completely. The farmer stared in disbelief, then quickly called for help to take the young Dinosaur away. Left alone, the Han guarded the damaged coup, breathing and waiting at the Dinosaur Circus. Crowds came from all around, but the Dinosaur's heart remained with his mother. He began a hunger strike in protest. The circus staff thought he was sick and called a doctor, who diagnosed him with a serious illness and gave him little time left. When the Han saw the news in the paper, she rushed to the circus at once. She called out to her young one again and again, but got no response. Just As she turned to leave, the Dinosaur's eyes suddenly opened, as if by a miracle. Overjoyed, the hen embraced him tightly. In the end, they performed together under the big top and spent the rest of their lives side by side, never to part again.

He didn't want to go, but she kept nagging, adding that wearing dirty clothes would make people look down on him. Tom had had enough. He took the bucket to the river, filled it, and started back. On the way, he heard a faint voice. It turned out a small fish had accidentally been scooped into the bucket. The fish begged him to return it to the river. At first, Tom didn't want to turn back.

So he turned and asked the little ant for help. At first, the ant didn't want to bother with him, but then an idea struck and it agreed right away. Under Donald's eager gaze, the ant crawled into the coconut. Before long, Donald began to sense something was wrong. He peeked inside only to find the little ant feasting happily all by itself. Furious, he started shouting. The little ant decided to push some leftover coconut out to him, but the hole was too small. The chunk wouldn't fit through.

Knowing a scolding was coming, the little ant quickly covered its ears to fill his stomach, Donald decided to go fishing. But with a hook and no bait, how could he catch anything? Just as he grew frustrated, he noticed the little ant nearby and a sly idea came to mind. He threw his hat into the water and pretended to panic, hoping to draw the ant's attention. The kind hearted ant heard Donald say the hat was very important to him, so without Hesitation, it climbed onto the fishhook to help. Seeing his plan succeed, Donald immediately began fishing.

Hearing this, the excited ant was about to take a look, but Donald suddenly dashed toward his raft. The aunt tried to follow, then noticed Donald's hat had fallen off. Thinking it should help pick it up, it turned around only to find Donald had already paddled away. The little aunt was about to shout after him, but suddenly stopped. It seemed to understand something. Just then, Donald tossed back the fishing line. It turned out he'd rushed off so fast to Stop the cruise ship. And he'd never forgotten his old friend.

To survive, the two drivers had no choice but to open the car doors and escape. The robbers did not intend to let them go. The distant sniper instantly killed both of them. Next, they Quickly cleaned up the scene. They took out the tires they had hidden beforehand and successfully replaced the damaged tire. Then they put a steel plate under the tires and easily drove the car out of the sandpile. Following a preset route, they guided the armored car to a designated location. This was an underground pit they had dug in advance. Finally, they covered the pit with a steel plate and a layer of sand to not leave any traces. They used a helicopter's propeller to flatten the sand. There was no sign of any digging.

The girl's name was Anna, and she had disappeared 20 years ago at the age of 16. This meant that Anna was indeed murdered in the videotape. To find out the truth, Jack visited Anna's mother's home.

She missed the shot on purpose in front of the man. The man picked up the gun to show off his skills. He hit the target three times in a row with great accuracy. He looked very proud. But the female assassin was not happy. She grabbed the gun and aimed at the target. She emptied the magazine. All eight bullets hit the target. The man was shocked. He still didn't know his wife was also a top assassin, but they worked for rival organizations. The couple had been living happily for six years, completely unaware of each other's identity. One day, they received the same assassination mission. Both their bosses gave orders to kill members of the enemy group on site. The woman prepared her ambush. She planted explosives along the target's path. Everything seemed perfect. But then a mountain bike appeared. She looked through her binoculars and saw the rider hit the trigger sensor. All the mines started counting down. The target hadn't entered the danger zone yet. She quickly cut the power to stop the bombs. At first, she thought the rider was just a normal person. But in the next second, he pulled out a rocket launcher. She realized he was from the rival group. He fired at him with a sniper rifle. Luckily, the man wore a bulletproof vest and wasn't hurt. He fired the rocket back at her. She escaped just In time, neither of them completed the mission. The man felt the person looked familiar. He asked a hacker to check the laptop she left behind. The hacker found an IP address. The man followed it and arrived at an office. He saw his wife's name on the door. He was stunned. That night, he tested his wife at the dinner table. He pretended to drop a wine bottle. She quickly caught it, but then let it fall on purpose. Still, the truth was clear. They both realized the other's secret. Each made an excuse to grab a broom, but really went to get weapons. The man carefully moved to the corner. The woman hiding upstairs fired two shots. The man fired back. She grabbed a shotgun and fired again. The man dodged and ran. His pistol ran out of bullets. He threw a kitchen knife at her. The woman got angry and shot at the kitchen. They fought from the kitchen to the living room. Both grabbed new weapons and faced each other, but neither could pull the trigger. In the end, the man dropped his gun. The woman couldn't do it either. She hugged him and kissed him.

The trainer gave him a weight plate as a reward. But that same weight plate got stuck around his neck. His condition became so bad that he was about to die. Yet he kept saying, this is fun. The trainer quickly calmed himself. The gym was completely empty. He decided to lay the body on the bench press, lift the barbell and drop it so it would look like an accident. Everyone knows bench pressing alone is dangerous. And a broken neck isn't unusual. The trainer carefully wiped his fingerprints and placed the dead man's prints on the barbell. Then he put every piece of equipment back in its place. After setting everything up, he went back to his office and waited for the morning members to discover the body. In reality, the trainer had no personal issue with that boy. Ryan was just a regular gym goer. But the trainer, Ethan, had created a leaderboard in the gym. Photos of the top three people for each exercise were displayed. That triggered Ryan's competitive side. He worked hard like everyone else, but his body didn't grow the same way. One day, he found out that the trainer was secretly giving something to a few members. Ryan thought it was a special supplement. He begged the trainer to give him some. After several requests, Ethan finally agreed to sell it. But the truth was, that supplement was stolen by Ethan's wife, From a hospital where she worked. It was very limited and only given to selected people. Unfortunately, Ethan didn't have any left at that time. So to keep Ryan satisfied, he bought organic milk powder with his own money and lied. And this is the real muscle building formula. If it doesn't work, I'll refund your money. Ryan happily drank it for days. But the only effect was that he started peeing a lot. His muscles stayed the same, while others kept breaking records. One day, Ryan secretly took someone else's bottle and compared it with his own. The difference was clear. The other bottle barely smelled like milk. That night, when the gym was empty, Ryan confronted the trainer. He said, give me what you're giving to others or I'll report you to the health department. Trainer tried to explain, I'm in trouble too, man. But Ryan refused to listen. The trainer tried to snatch the bottle. But Ryan, though not on the leaderboard, was actually a black belt in karate. The trainer's bulky body was no match for Ryan's speed. In panic, the trainer picked up a heavy weight plate and threw it straight at Ryan

As soon as he used a knife on the fish, he accidentally cut his finger. He did not even feel the pain. And thinking that his cut finger was a fish, he put it in the box. By the time he understood, the box was packed. The box had reached the shelves of big shops. Now, the man would go to the supermarket every day and shake the boxes and listen carefully to see if any strange sound was coming from anywhere. But even though he spent all his savings and bought all the boxes for that day, he still could not find his finger. He was about to give up hope when he heard a familiar knocking sound from a small shop on the roadside. Actually, he always had a habit of tapping the table, and his finger could not remain silent any longer. He ran and brought the box home. He did not expect that as soon as he opened the box, his real finger would come out from inside. And the surprising thing was that the finger got attached as before. The next morning, when he sat down to eat, he felt something strange. He realized that this finger was not his real one, because it Was repeatedly trying to enter his nose. Then he heard a knocking sound from nearby. He immediately understood that the real finger was probably with someone else and he was scratching his nose with that finger. Now, the man could not see this. He quickly moved forward and caught the wrist of that colleague. Now, a fight started between the two for the finger. Eventually, after a fight, he got his real finger back, but his colleague started shouting and calling him a thief. After a while, someone threw a severed finger in front of him.

To steal a diamond worth $500 million, the method he used was beyond anyone's imagination. He painted his entire body white and stood right in the middle of the museum hall posing as a statue. Not a single guard suspected that this statue was actually a living man. His hand was a book and hidden inside it was a tiny control panel. The moment he pressed a button, a small black car rolled out from behind a nearby column. Every single movement of that car had been planned with precision. It followed the black line on the floor so perfectly it looked like part of the design itself. Even the security cameras didn't detect anything suspicious. Then suddenly, a guard step right in front of the car. For a second, it seemed like the whole plan would fall apart, but the thief stayed calm. The car quietly moved under the guard's feet, went ahead and reach straight to the glass case where the diamond was kept. That's when the real game began. The car positioned itself into the pedestal's gap and started climbing the vertical surface.

His eyes widened at the sight of gold scattered throughout the cave. He was thrilled to walk on the glittering coins, but he treaded cautiously because a huge dragon was sleeping within. His true goal wasn't gold, but a mysterious diamond more precious than all these treasures. He knew it didn't look like any ordinary crystal, but finding it among so many treasures was like searching for a needle in a sea of dust. Suddenly, his foot slipped and he accidentally knocked over a huge pile of gold within which the dragon lay sleeping. Terrified, he immediately hid behind a stone pillar. If the dragon woke, his end was certain. He peeked out in fear and saw the dragon's tail twitching. Now he was certain it was about to awaken. He put on his magic ring, which could make him invisible. But the dragon's sense of smell was extreme, extremely sharp. It caught his scent in his sleep and began to chase. When the man realized that escape was impossible, he took off the ring and appeared. The dragon laughed at it. Alarmed, he immediately said, I've heard stories of your greatness, but I've only come to see your beautiful eyes. The dragon was delighted to hear this and proudly revealed his true form. In reality, he was searching for someone who could care for this vast treasure. Just then, the man spotted the diamond He was looking for. He slowly moved toward it, praising the dragon, but the dragon sensed his trick. As soon as he got close to the diamond, the dragon pushed him hard, knocking him down. Undeterred, the man ran and tried to catch it. But in his haste, the dragon broke one of the cave's pillars. His companions outside heard the sound and realized the dragon had awakened. They immediately sent Jack inside to rescue him, but Jack emerged with the diamond.

Within moments, the tree grew to a height of 100 feet. All the farmers were shocked to see such a miracle. Just then, a boy standing nearby snatched all the seeds from the old man and ran away. While running, he scattered the seeds all over the ground. As soon as the seeds touch the soil, giant coconut trees sprang up everywhere. But by mistake, the boy also grew himself into one of the trees. Because of those trees, the desert was no longer short of wood. There was now plenty of timber to build a grand palace for the king. But the workers were having a hard time lifting the heavy stones. Seeing their struggle, the old grandfather made a magical soup. He handed it to one man and said, drink this. The moment the man drank the soup, he felt a strange power surge through his body. He walked up to a six ton stone and lifted it as if it were just a piece of paper. Everyone was astonished. Now everyone wanted to drink the magical soup. Long line formed. Then a woman drank the soup. As soon as she did, her body was filled with immense strength too. She picked up a 10 ton boulder and threw it far away with ease. All the workers became incredibly strong because of the Magical soup? With that strength, they completed the work, which was supposed to take years, in just two and a half months. But then a fat man accidentally broke the nose of the special statue made for the king with his big belly. Still, with the help of the old man's magical soup and magical seeds, they created such a magnificent structure. That no one has been able to build anything like it ever since. Do you know the name of that incredible structure

It became clear that they weren't police officers at all. They were pirates. The treasure belonged to them and they wanted it back, along with the fisherman's lives. At that moment, a clever fisherwoman came up with a plan. She quickly swam to the surface and climbed out of the water. But one Of the pirates grabbed her foot and pulled her back down. At that moment, her companion knocked the pirate's knife out of his hand with a shell. The girl, see to the opportunity, cut the pirate's oxygen pipe and tied his foot to the rope. Her companion dragged the pirate toward the rocks, trapping him there. Gradually, the other fisherman arrived and cut the oxygen pipes of each pirate one by one. In the underwater battle, the pirates couldn't stand up to the fishermen and lost. But as soon as they emerged from the water, the fake police on the ship started shooting at them. One brave fisherman pushed a pirate with all his might, knocking him off the ship, but he fell off, too. The surprising thing was that the girl who had grown up in the sea, didn't know how to swim and faint it. Her companions pulled her onto the deck. Just then, the real pirate leader stealthily boarded the ship. He aimed his gun and ordered everyone to jump into the sea. The pirate opened the treasure chest and saw that along with the gold, there were also diamonds. He wanted to take everything. But one clever fisherman secretly tied the anchor rope to a rock. While the pirate was trying to operate the ship, another fisherman climbed up from the other side and grabbed a weapon. Suddenly, the rope snapped and the pirate fell into the sea. At that moment, the unconscious girl regained consciousness. The captain quickly started the ship and the fisherman made it safely out of there with a treasure. When they opened the boxes, not only did they find gold, but diamonds as well. The shine wasn't just from the wealth, it was from their victory and hope. In this way, ordinary fishermen who had worked only to fill their stomachs found honor and joy through the treasure they stumbled upon.

Which, according to Davy, meant dressing like a celebrity. Leaving LAX. Since the whole school now knew what a psycho liar she was, Davy felt like her only move was to be completely invisible. Perhaps until graduation. Her plan worked pretty well for a few days. That is, until she assumed Eric Perkins could remain upright for the length of a hallway. Oh, damn it! My Raisinets! It's where I get all my freaking vitamins! Ha ha! Coyote girl. I know your secret. You have a hot cousin. I saw her drop you off yesterday. You think she'd be into me? Um, she's kind of an arranged marriage, stitch. Just ask her. Anyway, for the first time, Davey was relieved to hear someone praise Kamala's appearance. Because it meant Trent did not know a real secret. In fact, no one seemed to know. Holy shit. Paxton didn't tell anyone she lied. Why was he protecting her? Did he care about her? Was he in love? Nope. He just forgotten about her. Hey, ladies. What's poppin? Seats taken? Don't hate me. I got cheese fries and chili fries for the tape. Jonah, since when are you guys friends? Since a couple days ago, when we became inseparable after coming out to Eleanor, Fabiola was still struggling with how to tell her family. Luckily for her, Jonah was struggling with the same thing. Jonah has been a really good friend to us and definitely hasn't yelled at us for no reason. I didn't yell at you guys. Yeah, she did. Trust me. Whatever you guys have going on, my shit's bigger, okay? I have the bigger shit. Okay? I guess it's fair to call that a yell.

On one side of the tape lived the mother and daughter, while the other side belonged to the father. Crossing that line was strictly forbidden. Whenever the father accidentally stepped on the tape, the mother would explode in anger. She would push him hard until he fell. He would quickly get up and try to explain it was just a mistake. But before he could finish, she would push him again, making his lunch box scatter across the floor. Out of control, she started throwing anything she could find, even the photo frame of their daughter, Emily. Ryan had grown used to these fights. He no longer reacted each time. He simply looked away in silence. Mother's obsession went so far that whenever Ryan's foot accidentally touched the tape, she would replace it immediately with a new one. Even if Emily crossed it by mistake, her mother would yell at her, too. During meals, the mother and daughter enjoyed delicious home cooked food, while Ryan had nothing but instant noodles. His eating corner was tiny compared to theirs. Even the staircase had a strip of tape dividing it. After taking a shower, he had to be extra careful not to step on the line. When Ryan returned to his small room, Emily often noticed his slippers touching the tape, so she would quietly place them back behind the line to keep her father from getting into Trouble again. The strangest part was that her mother had forbidden Emily from speaking to her father. If she was caught doing so, she'd get scolded badly. Still, Emily made up her mind before turning 18, she would uncover the secret behind that tape. The next morning, after seeing her father leave for work, she ran after him. Only once they were far from home could she finally say hello. That small greeting was something she could only share with him outside the house. After walking for a bit, Emily asked, dad, why is there a tape in our home? Ryan stopped walking and said softly that even he didn't really know. Maybe he once said something that hurt her mother deeply, and ever since then, things had been this way, but he couldn't even remember what he said and her mother never told him. Looking sad, Ryan turned to leave. But as he waited at a red light, suddenly someone pushed him hard from behind.

Then came the chaos of a fight nearby. I tried desperately to move, but my body felt locked in place. My vision started to fade. A single snowflake froze in my palm. I knew the pain had finally ended, but fate refused to let me rest. As expected, I was reborn again. My memories were still shattered. The cycle of death still haunted me. But the pain from the past had turned into anger. When faced with another attack, I no longer stayed silent. He's coming. English girls, you really are something. I pushed the boy away and discovered something new. The further you run from bullies, the more arrogant they become. Only by facing them can you shatter their mask. So when another predator appeared, I tore away the veil of fear. Blindfold off, I opened the door, dragged him into the sunlight and made him face judgment and shame. Later, I met Mike. It happened at a bonfire night. We were drawn to each other instantly. Mike gave me a love I had never known before. I thought life would finally stay calm, but then the war began. Mike told me he was leaving for the front line. He said it was his dream. My heart ached deeply, but I chose to Support him. Because of that courage, my path stayed rough, but I avoided many more traps. In time, I earned a job in the government. During my free hours, I played with my nephews, argued with my stubborn brother, felt the gentleness of my younger one, and watched my parents grow old. I can no longer remember how many times I have lived but for this moment of peace. Every past struggle feels worth it. Still, not all pain can be avoided. Shortly after the war began, my brother came home with news. Mike had fallen on the front line. His body never returned. My brother feared I would break down, but no tears came out. No matter what anyone said. I'm going to get him back. What? I'll get him back.

He was a world class chef who often cooked in luxury hotels and banquets, but now he needed an assistant to work with him. One day, his eyes fell on a girl cooking food by the roadside.

On the day of the interview, the chef told all the candidates, whoever makes the best fried rice will become my assistant. Everyone started preparing. One candidate used fresh ingredients, butter and garnish, so the dish looked attractive. Meanwhile, the girl took leftover rice, added just one egg and started frying it in a very simple way. Now there were two different plates in front of the chef. He first smelled the girl's fried rice and without tasting it, said This is the flavor I am looking for. People were surprised, but the chef understood that real flavor is always hidden in simplicity.

As soon as Helena came near, he sat on the ground and started writing something, maybe trying to talk. But Helena didn't pay any attention. Right then, the science minister arrived, and she got busy talking with him. At that moment, another human came and erased everything Jack had written. Angry, Jack attacked him, and once again he lost his chance to talk to Helena. When he was thrown back into the cage, the minister looked at his drawings, but erased them all. Instead of reacting, Jack sat helplessly inside the cage. Then Helena came back. Jack quickly held her hand and grabbed the pen and paper. The guard hit him, but Jack hurriedly wrote his name. Helena was shocked a human, considered the lowest in their society, could write. She took Jack to her home to study him more closely. Jack wrote on a sheet he was from earth, and after a spaceship crash, he was captured. Helena's husband, Laughed and said, he's crazy. Flying is impossible. Jack proved it. He took a small piece of paper, folded it into the shape of a plane and threw it. That tiny paper plane became the symbol of their world. Helena's husband was stunned. Just then, the science minister arrived. When he saw the paper plane, his face changed completely. He immediately ordered the guards catch Jack, as if Jack was hiding a dangerous secret.

The next second, a group of alien creatures surrounded the body and began devouring it. Jack squatted down to observe them eating, but just then, a fly suddenly landed on him. The fly tore through the man's protective suit and crawled inside. Not long after, the fly suddenly appeared on the man's face, which scared him badly. His teammate quickly rushed over to help, but by then, the fly had already entered the man's body. They immediately sent him to the hospital. After examining him, the doctor found that the fly was moving under the man's skin. He immediately said that amputation was necessary. When the man heard that, he begged the doctor not to cut off his limb. But at that moment, the fly suddenly changed direction and started moving toward the man's lower body. Seeing this, the man screamed and demanded that the doctor amputate him. But it was already too late. So the doctor had to use the second option. He told the nurse to turn the man over, then picked up a pair of tweezers and inserted them into the man's rectum. The man screamed in pain and struggled violently. But fortunately, after the Doctor's efforts, the fly was finally removed. However, the doctor soon realized that this was no ordinary fly. It was a mutated alien species. What the doctor didn't know was that the real crisis was only just beginning.

He's got a tube on his back with a world famous painting inside, and now he's being chased by gang members. He manages to shake them off thanks to how well he knows the area. Just when he thinks he's safe, a gang car suddenly shows up right in front of him. Luke uses all his strength to run toward the train station. He finally jumps onto a train that just started moving. Totally exhausted, he slumps down in the train car. But before he can even catch his breath, a woman sitting across from him tells him to hand over the painting. There's no way he's giving it up. Then out of nowhere, the woman's partner grabs him. She grabs the tube and takes off. But the guy breaks free fast. He jumps up and runs after her. He didn't expect the woman to be that skilled, but he's pretty tough himself. In the end, he overpowers her, pushes her into the bathroom and locks the door. Then he climbs out the train door and up to the roof, times his jump perfectly, grabs onto the water pipe connected to the steam engine and finally loses her. Next day, he shows up at the museum, meets up with his sister who works there. While she's distracted, he swaps out the museum painting and runs. She's shocked by what he did. No time to think. She chases after him. Tells him to give the painting back. He says he will, but only if she gets in the car with him first. She has no choice, so she gets in. Right then the cops show up. He tries to lose them, but they just won't quit. Just when she thinks it's over, he suddenly drives into the back of a big rig container. Inside the container, his assistant scans the painting but finds out it's not the original. That's when the sister realizes her brother's team is using clues hidden in six paintings to find the fountain of youth. Each original has a special hidden Mark on the back, but the museum one doesn't. She tells him it's just a replica, so there's no way it has the clue they need. The real one sank decades ago. Recovering it would cost millions. For him, it's basically impossible. But what she didn't expect was for him to point at the guy next to them wearing glasses. Turns out this guy, Owen, is super rich. A million bucks means nothing to him cause he's dying from a terminal illness and the only thing that might save him is the legendary fountain of youth. It might be the only way for him to live forever.

Now criminals had to lose a part of their body every month. The decision of how severe the punishment would be was left to the victim's family. This continued until the family wrote a letter of forgiveness. The first criminal was Marlow, a cruel man who had harmed a little girl. When he found out that the same pain would now come back to him, he complete, completely broke down. Marlow lay on the operation table while the girl's family stood in front of him. Her father picked up the phone, and there was fire in his eyes. As the scalpel went down, a smile of relief spread across his face, but the little daughter couldn't watch. Scared, she walked out of the room. A few days later, the second operation began. This time, only the father and the elder daughter were there. The moment the sound of the chainsaw echoed, even the elder daughter quietly turned and left. That day, Marlo lost his left leg and right arm. Now he was drowning in fear and regret. On the third operation day, only the girl's father remained. After surgery, Marlow lost his last leg. He was now completely crippled. Still, the father decided to continue the punishment. Marlow's kidney and a lung were removed. He was kept alive only with feeding tubes and was even forced to watch videos of his own surgeries. Now Marlo was Quiet. He had turned humble, but the family was still not ready to forgive. On the fifth operation, Marlo's private parts were removed. This time, he did not cry, not even a single tear. The sixth surgery came. His ears, nose and the tip of his tongue were cut off. Even his hair was burned away with lasers. In the end, when Marlow looked more like a mummy than a man, only then the father signed the forgiveness papers without saying a word. With a tired face, he walked out of the room. Marlow's punishment was finally over, but nothing human was left in him anymore.

For you, not only will I kill you, I will sell your body parts for cash. There were these women, nurses, three nurses. And they were naughty. Really, really naughty. They were three naughty nurses. Me, too, said Crystal as she snapped on her surgical glove. And then there was Marta. Where was I, Marta? Oh, yes. Marta was the naughtiest nurse of all because she knew how.

Well, baby, are you sure it's stolen? Maybe you just forgot where you parked it, Rochelle. It's not keys. It's a truck. Even if I forgot where I parked it, you can still see it cause it's a truck. Well, don't get mad at me. You act like I stole it. That's it. I'm starting a block watch. That sounds like a good idea. As soon as I finish this toe. My mother was a ghetto snob. So to her, this wasn't just a block watch meeting. It was a Rochelle watch meeting. Ha ha. Uh huh. Uh huh. Hey, I'm watching you because my mother was the blockwatch captain. If anything happened in the neighborhood, Miss Louise made sure she heard about it. There's a brand graffiti downstairs. I'll file a report. There's a mad dog chasing people. I'll file a report. Somebody stole my mail. I'll file a report. Rochelle? Yes, Louise, I need stickers. What stickers? I've been up and down this block. I've looked in every window and there are no stickers. How do we expect offenders not to offend if there are no stickers? I'll get you some stickers, Louise. Thank you. Whoa, whoa, baby. That's 9 cent worth the tape. Hi, Julius. I'm so sorry about your truck. I can't believe they stole it right off the street. It was right here. Right here. Right here next to the fire hydrant. Oh, they must have just put that there. Well, it probably wouldn't have happened if it had a sticker on it. I like her. What? After a week of being captain of the blockwatch, my mother was going down with the ship.

Um, actually, Cassie, I think I wanna focus on the fall injuries first. Okay. We can address the pregnancy once we know that you're alright. Oh, okay. Okay. So we will see you up in the U. R. Shortly. What are you doing? You really over stepped in there. I'm a trauma surgeon. I don't order abortions. You would have it if the fetus hadn't survived, but it did. Owen, she's 8 weeks. She doesn't need a full D& C. Exactly. It's not an emergency, but her internal injuries are. So I'm gonna deal with those and then she can go see an OB.

Uh oh. Why is Miss Clarkson talking about, boy, turn around before I smack a face onto the back of your head. Why is this Clarkson talking about you were in her house with Tasha and it's all over the neighborhood? I do not appreciate the whole neighborhood knowing something about my child and I'm the last to find out. My mother hated being the last to find out about anything. Let's go. Why am I the last to know? Congratulations, you're pregnant. That's great. Pregnant. Well, why am I the last to know what's going on? That's what I'm trying to find out. Miss Clarkson said that Chris was in her house with Tasha. Doing what? Nothing. She asked me to come over because there was a mouse in her closet. I got rid of it and then we went right back outside. Getting rid of a mouse? Is that what they're calling it nowadays? Are you an exterminator? If you are, let me see your paycheck. No, Chris, I don't care if you were over somebody's house getting rid of a mouse, a spider, a roach, a tiger. I was just trying to help. Chris, please tell me, is that all that really happened? Cause Miss Clarkson seems to think that you were doing more than just getting rid of a mouse. Boy. Well, after we went outside, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, Jerome saw. Next thing I know, it's all over the neighborhood. And you had nothing to do with spreading that. Hey, well, you know, hey, well, you know, well, what is that supposed to mean, Michelle? Chris and I need to talk for a minute. You putting me out? We need to have a man to man talk. Okay, fine. Julius, the next time somebody comes to this house with a problem, I'm gonna send him directly to you. Is that okay? Huh? Alright, sit down, Chris, if you're leading people to believe you did something with that girl you didn't do, then you need to fix it. But I never said we did anything. Let me tell you how to treat women, son. If you do something, you should never say anything. If you don't do something and you don't say anything, that means you did something, even if you did nothing. So by not saying anything, you doing something and you need to say something to let people know you did nothing. You understand? No? Yeah. I want everyone to listen to me. Tasha is not my girlfriend. She never was. I know everybody thinks that something was going on between us, but nothing happened. And not nothing, something, nothing, nothing. Tasha's a nice girl. She's not like that. I've got rid of a mouse for then. She gave me a kiss on the cheek and a hug. That's it. Tasha, I'm sorry. Now, would you all quit talking about this? Because there is nothing to talk about. I Wish there was something to talk about, but there's not. Okay. Get off of my car, fool.

There's no party. Doctor Crev always assigned it to a resident, and he's not here anymore, so. So you'll make sure it happens? Oh, I have plans. I know. I just gave them to you. Am I okay? Did I miss Halloween? Your arms are fine. You're fine. And you didn't Miss anything? Trick or treating didn't even start yet.

Courts have only dealt with this issue tangentially. In Roe v. Wade, the court implied that an unborn baby was alive when it could survive on its own. Could drew householder survive without being hooked up to all those machines? His doctor say that he could not. So, in effect, the life you took from Drew Householder wasn't really life to begin with, was it? All I know is that when I looked in his crib, I saw a baby who couldn't form the most basic thought of his own. He couldn't love. And when I saw the pain that. The unutterable suffering that his existence was causing the two people who loved him most, I had to do something, whether that meant going to prison or not. Does Mrs. Householder have sole custody of drew? Um, no. Uh, she, uh. She shares it with Mr. Householder. Did you confer with him before you hasten the death of his son? No. Do you feel guilty for what you've done? You feel guilty for what you're doing? I'll ask again. Do you feel guilty for what you've done? I did what I felt was right. Mr. Barber. Do you feel guilty, sir? I do. Will the defendant please rise? Have you reached a verdict? Yes, we have, your honor. On the sole count of the indictment, murder in the second Degree.

But when you went into Drew Householder's hospital room, he was alive. When you came out, he was dead. Somebody did something. Yes, I killed him. Um, but what I did, I don't believe that it was a murder. I'm starting to feel like we're walking a razor's edge here, Mr Barber. It was a justifiable homicide. In other words, you had to do it. There were these, um, flowers on the Table next to Drew's crib, orange roses. He would never know how wonderful they are. He couldn't smell them. His mom was playing one of Bach cantatas from her phone, the Eternal Bach. Drew couldn't hear it. The bottom line is that he would never even know that these things existed. He didn't know if he was hungry or thirsty. He couldn't recognize the faces of his mother or his father. All that he did know, all that he would ever know was the pain that was his so called life. How do you know? The doctors say that his brain has stopped functioning. So he was dead already.

You're okay. Oh, I'm so relieved. I'll kiss her. You know, you want to. But I saw your bed was. Of course, I'm okay. I'm just waiting for my parents to pick. Me up. This place is a total freak show. These are from the whole squad. You're using this as an excuse to see me. And you didn't need to call 9, 1 1. You were unconscious. I thought maybe you had broken your neck or something. No, you saw an opportunity and you jumped on it. I've seen the pictures. I can overcome it because I look super hot in them. But you need to be honest with yourself. You want me to be honest? The only reason I'm here is because nobody else would come. What? I felt sorry for you. You felt sorry for me. At least I have some compassion. Everybody else just hates you. Whoa! Intense.

Okay, look, I, I don't know how much time we have, so I need you to do two things for me when you get back. You can talk now, if you make it back. What do you mean if? First, I need you to order me pizza. Pizza. Why? Because I think the smell might wake up my brain and pull me out of my coma. You can smell in a coma? Yeah. Well, then can you smell your farts? Cause they're disgusting. So are your cigarettes. Can you really hear? Yes. Everything. And I'm so stuck. This isn't where I want to be. But you can help me change that. No, I can't. Yes, you can. Because you're stuck too, even if you're not in a coma. Oh my God. Shut up. Fine. But the second thing, and this is really important, I need you to tell my dad that It wasn't his fault. What? No. Who's your dad? Tara, can you hear me? Kara, Kara! I so freaked her out. Kara, Kara! What? I want an Echo and EKG and a chest X ray. She needs to be wearing a heart monitor. I'm assuming she has one. Hello, I can hear you. I know, baby. It might have been a virus that went undetected. I'm so sorry. So what happens now? First, we need to simply monitor her, keep her comfortable, but eventually she is going to need a heart transplant. My God. When? Well, I'm not sure. But I do have to warn you that hearts are very hard to come by and the waiting list is long. Well, we'll just get on another list then. It is not that simple. And unfortunately, Kara's gonna have a very difficult time qualifying. Why? We drug test her. We found amphetamines, nicotine, cocaine, marijuana, and those were just the preliminary results. And that is going to put her at the bottom of the waiting list for heart. How do you tell the girl who needs a heart that she never really had one to begin with?

Even when I'm working out, A few drops leak out. I hold it in the rest of the time. I keep myself busy inside the prison, working hard. And finally, on this day, lunch comes with soybeans. I swallow them all in one gulp. When the warden walks in for inspection, I fake a choke, spit the soybeans back out. One shot. Get this damn convict away from me! Get in! Firmary! The doctor takes one look at me and quickly makes a diagnosis. One injection would cure it. But I've drunk so much water that I can't hold it anymore. The doctor hands me a bedpan. I laugh and tell him this thing is way too small. I need 10 of them just to get through. That's when another inmate steps in and offers to take me to the toilet. So we walk over. What nobody knows is that inside this tiny cubicle, there's a hidden passage. I climb up on the toilet, tell the inmate to stand guard at the door, and I pull out a tool I hit earlier. Done taping off, I unlock the white phone. Once I'm inside, I shut it back down, making it look like nothing ever happened. The passage leads straight to the tool room. We take out a wooden plank and slide it underneath the truck. The moment the truck rolls out, we slip into The hollow space inside the plank. When the vehicle passes through the checkpoint, the scanners don't pick up the thing. Then, at a gas station stop, we crawl out, ditch the plank, and bolt toward our friend's car. Just like that, we make it out of prison alive. But inside the car, the woman driving keeps stealing glances at me.

She asked the teacher if she was period. The teacher replied, he's a boy. They notified the boy's parents. The boy was rushed to the hospital.

A massive tsunami suddenly rose from the ocean surface. Everyone quickly grabbed their oxygen tanks and ran into a cave. They jumped into a pool of water to escape the danger. Soon, seawater flooded into the cave. The islands they were on was swallowed by the ocean. As they swam deeper, they made an unexpected discovery. The pool was actually connected to the ocean floor. The group decided to dive deeper to investigate. That's when they stumbled upon a treasure. A sunken ship appeared before their eyes. They hurried inside the vest. Surprisingly, the ship's cabin still had breathable air. Evryone quickly removed their oxygen tanks and shut off the valves. They had no idea how long the storm would last. All they could do was rest here for now. Based on the ship's furnishings and design, it was at least 100 years old. It was amazing that it remained so well preserved. The murals on the walls left them stunned. They depicted an ancient legend. The legend spoke of a mysterious bone with a powerful fragrance that could ward off evil spirit. While everyone was mesmerized by the murals content, the woman noticed something even more terrifying. She felt someone staring at her from behind. When she moved closer to investigate, she found nothing there. Just then, her companion noticed something strange, too. There was a hidden passageway in the Cabin, but they hadn't brought any equipment to explore it. The man told everyone to stay put. While they were all absorbed in studying the murals, the man caught a whiff of fragrance. It turned out to be just a prank by one of his companions. After the false alarm, everyone fell asleep. Later, the man smelled the fragrance again. He assumed it was the girl's perfume and didn't think much of it. He had no idea how much time had passed. When he woke up, he found himself alone in the cabin. His companions had mysteriously vanished. A companion's notebook was still there where they'd left it. As he carefully examined his surroundings, he realised something was wrong. He wasn't in the ship's cabin anymore. The passageway had turned into a solid stone wall. Before he could figure out what was happening, something even more terrifying occurred. A stone box suddenly appeared in the cabin. Something seemed to be trying to break out of it. The man immediately put on his oxygen tank and dove into the water. He swam for what felt like forever. Just as his oxygen was running out, he finally broke through to the surface. The storm had passed. Decades went by. The man never gave up searching for his missing companions. He could never understand what had happened. The island where they'd taken shelter had completely vanished. This mystery haunted him for the rest of his life. To find some peace of mind wherever He went, he always carried a photo of him and his companions.

At first, I had no idea what was happening. When I finally found a water source, I drank without hesitation. The next second, I was back in the desert. This cycle continued for 300 years. I finally figured it out. The problem was with that water source. This time, I chose to walk straight across the water without drinking a drop. The curse didn't trigger. I found a highway and flagged down a car to get home. The driver handed me a bottle of water and parched as I was, I drank it. Immediately, tragedy struck again. I was back in the desert. The water in the bottle had turned to sand. Fuck. To get home, I dragged my exhausted body back to the highway after flagging down the same car. I refused the water the driver offered and finally made it home. Lying on the couch, I heard the sound of dripping water. Only then did I realize I hadn't drunk water in hundreds of years. Turn on the tap and fill the glass to the brim, even adding a few ice cubes. After my experience with eating sand, I was extra cautious this time. I dipped my finger in and tasted a drop. I waited. Nothing happened. I continued carefully tasting it with my finger. Still nothing perfect. I down the entire glass in one go. Thinking the curse was broken, I jumped straight into the pool. Outside, just as I was savoring the moment, a mouthful of sand nearly choked me. I broke down. What the hell did I do wrong? Driven by sheer determination, I made my way back to the city once more. Looking at the bustling streets, I suddenly remembered once someone dying of thirst had asked me for water and I refused. I quickly stopped a passing woman and asked if she could spare me some water. She refused, saying the water was for her dog. The next second, she vanished. I knew where she'd gone.

The little girl initially thought I was joking until I told her to fetch toilet paper. After finishing, I had the older daughter empty it. That evening, when the parents returned, the girl told her mother about me using the toilet. The mother didn't believe her at all, and the father even scolded his daughter, insisting she should be an honest child. Each to next day, my behavior escalated. I smeared expired yogurt on my finger and ordered the older daughter to eat it immediately. Though reluctant, the girl obeyed out of fear. Even more absurdly, I commanded her to eat it with her hands and lick the container clean. The parents remained completely unaware of any of this. When the couple returned from work, I would hypocritically prepare dinner for the family. My actions grew increasingly bizarre after the mother left for work, I actually left the two children alone and hid. The little girl searched the entire room, but couldn't find me. Helpless, she opened the door and leaned over the stairwell, looking down. Seeing her older sister walk out, the younger brother crawled around on the floor. Suddenly, the boy started wailing he had seen me hiding under the bed. I then crawled out with a grotesque expression, making all sorts of incomprehensible faces, and even bit the boy on the shoulder. Fortunately, it was a close call, but no real harm was done. Even one day, the family went on a trip and took me along. Um, but I felt no gratitude. Seeing their wealthy, carefree life, I secretly resolved to stay in this household forever. However, the children would eventually grow up. A third child could solve this pressing problem, so I secretly searched online for remedies and added the purchased medication to their meals. I crushed the pills in a bowl and mixed them thoroughly into the family's food. My goal was to make them have a third child quickly so my job could be secure indefinitely. The plan failed because the mother, exhausted from work, went to bed early, and the father spent all his free time scrolling through his phone on the couch. Seeing the plan fail, I immediately changed my demeanor. Watching their harmonious relationship, my thoughts grew increasingly twisted. If the children grew up, or if the grandmother replaced me, I would face unemployment. The more I thought about it, the more resentful I became. E meanwhile, I privately entered the owner's room. Finally able to act without restraint, I went into the master bedroom, first engaging in strange behaviors, even fixating on dandruff on the pillows. I trashed the room, scattering garbage everywhere. I knew that as long as I cleaned up before they returned, there would be no issue. Then one day, while I was watching the children play in the park, I became careless, and the older daughter went missing. Frantically, I searched everywhere. And fortunately found her on a bench by the path. I picked her up, scolding her incessantly. Annoyed by my nagging, the little girl bit me. Uh, that bite ironically saved me once, Joe. Later, the mother noticed a bruise on her son's shoulder and asked me about it. Sensing trouble, I quickly blamed the older daughter. Even showing the bite Mark on my own shoulder is proof that the older girl had a biting habit. Once again, the mother believed me. But she didn't know the nightmare was just beginning. After the incident in the park where the older daughter got lost, another terrible idea occurred to me. If only one child remained, would the mother try for another? The next day, I lost all interest in watching the children. I took out a fruit knife I had prepared earlier and filled the bathtub with hot water. Sensing something wrong, the older daughter hid under the bed. The soon after, the mother returned from work, to a horrifying scene. I was dead. The room was in disarray, blood was everywhere, and the two children were missing.

I could only stay alive with a ventilator. The dog accidentally knocked out the plug. The machine stopped working instantly. I desperately tried to call my wife, but my throat couldn't make any sound. She was taking care of our child. Where's daddy? Martin, what is that is in there? The oxygen was running out. Bit by bit, I lost consciousness and despair. Luckily, she discovered something was wrong. She quickly plugged the power back in. Robin, Robin, Robin. After a brief moment of shock, I finally opened my eyes again. That was interesting. To prevent another accident, she installed a bell beside my bed. I just needed to shake my head. She would come immediately. Our son would wave at me from the window. Even though I was lying here like a living corpse, I was filled with the desire to live because I had promised her I would spend my whole life with her. Back then, I was just a poor guy with nothing. She was a rich girl. Everyone admired just one look. I fell hopelessly in love with her. My friend told me to give up. She had rejected too many suitors. Very few could win her heart. But I didn't give up. I decided to take a chance for love. The ball flew from the opposite side. I deliberately hit it behind her. She saw through my little trick. She looked back and smiled at me at that. Moment, I knew she felt something too soon we were together. Our love had no long build up. Like two shooting stars meeting in the night sky, instantly burning with brilliant light. But the gap between our statuses was too big. Her wealthy family down on a poor guy like me. But she said she would marry no one else. We were ready to walk down the aisle. Her two brothers strongly opposed it. They thought their sister should live in a castle, not suffer with a poor guy. But she had made up her mind in love. The thing is, I just know this is it, she said. The world's had plenty of good partners, but only one could make her have no regrets. She married me without hesitation. After the wedding, I took her to Kenya for adventure. She loved this feeling of exploring the unknown. We flew planes through canyons, drove cars, racing through the sunset. We spent a sweet honeymoon in Kenya. Our marriage was filled with unique sweetness. During the trip, she got pregnant with our child. I felt incredibly lucky. I married the girl many dreamed of. I promised her we would grow old together, but heaven seemed jealous of our perfection. He played a cruel joke on us at the embassy party. I, who had never lost a game, made mistake after mistake that day. I suddenly felt powerless in the days. At first I thought I was just tired. I didn't take It seriously. While spinning the hula hoop, I lost my balance and fell again. I struggled to stand up, still pretending everything was fine, making jokes with her. You sure you're alright? Yeah. It's a pregnancy, isn't it? She's making my joints ache, that's all. Oh, poor woman. That night, she went home. First, I stayed at the embassy for tomorrow's meeting. Suddenly, intense pain hit my whole body. Breathing became extremely difficult. I dragged myself to find my friend. Then I collapsed on the ground. This time, I never stood up again. When I was sent to the hospital, my hands and feet had lost all feeling. Even breathing was incredibly hard. My whole body was burning with fever. The doctor used ice to cool me down. In just two minutes, I almost went into shock. The doctor had to insert a tube in my throat. The ventilator saved my life. The next day, she rushed to the hospital. When she walked into the room, saw me lying weakly on the bed, the ventilator buzzing beside me. Overnight, I went from a lively young man to a dying person hanging by a thread. I painfully opened my mouth but couldn't make a single sound. I had incurable polio, completely paralyzed below the neck, unable to breathe on my own. Even with the ventilator, I could only last three months. My life had started its countdown. This devastating news was like thunder constantly hitting her fragile heart. But she didn't Cry hysterically. Instead, she was unusually calm because no matter what, she wouldn't give up on me.

But since I had already taken her husband's deposit, she eventually let me in. Not long after I started playing, smelled something strange.

As I walked through the living room, I intentionally stepped into some water on the floor so I would look more like a real blind person. Once I entered the bathroom, I realized the killer was right behind me, holding a gun. I held my breath and tried not to make any movement that could expose me. Fortunately, he didn't suspect anything. When I passed the living room again, I saw the face of the dead man. Clearly, it was the wealthy man who had hired me.

The man had been known for his generosity and always tipped Me whenever he hired me. In the end, I went to the police station and said I wanted to report a case. But before I could finish speaking, I saw the man who had been hiding in the bathroom. He was wearing a police uniform. I froze. He was the chief of police. Luckily, I reacted quickly and changed my story immediately, saying that my cat had been killed. The chief's eyes were cold as a knife. He had just killed a man, and now the only witness was sitting right in front of him. He clearly suspected that I wasn't really blind. He insisted on taking me home himself. As soon as we arrived, he noticed a newspaper on my table. I said it was there to line the trash bin. But he obviously didn't believe me. He kept testing me. At one point, he even threw a small knife near my head. I didn't move. Fortunately, he didn't see through my act. The next day, the rich man's body was found floating by the river. His wife cried bitterly during the interview. Later, the police chief blamed the murder on a young man. I was called in to give a statement and had to listen to them fabricating the entire report. My palms were sweating. I wanted to stand up and tell the truth. But that was just a fantasy. I knew that if I spoke up, I would end up like that rich man, dead. I thought Everything was over. But then a twist appeared. At the funeral, the man's wife kept talking about what had happened before his death, unaware that during the murder, she and the chief had overlooked someone. The old lady next door. After the funeral, that old lady went to the police and said the rich man's wife was lying. When the wife found out, she went to the old lady's house and knocked on her door. At that time, I happened to have been hired by the rich man's daughter as her private tutor. When the elevator doors open, I saw with my own eyes the rich man's wife pushing the old lady down the stairs. My legs went weak. I almost collapsed. I forced myself to stay calm and pretended I hadn't seen anything. I didn't know whether the old lady was killed because she provided evidence. But I believe that woman had gone insane. She wanted to eliminate everyone who knew the truth. I wanted to escape. But before I could step outside, someone knocked on my door.

Soon it was meal time. Jack wasn't used to the sticky food. He wasted it and got beaten badly. I was sent into the kitchen. I became a helper, serving during meals. That day, a priest came to preach. I spoke about God's creation. I said all people should be equal. The slaves were moved by my words. The priest got angry. He said slavery was God's will. I told him he was wrong. The book says everyone is equal before god. The priest froze. He never thought I could read. The farmer heard I was literate. He made me his assistant. One day, I gave him a report. Rich guests saw me enter the hall. They were unhappy. The farmer said I was smart. The rich men laughed at me. They said a slave couldn't be smart and could never play the piano. I walked over to prove them wrong, but I wasn't allowed. I was tied up and beaten. That's when we started planning to escape. The farmer's daughter's wedding was coming. He told merchants to deliver goods the next day. When the merchants came, he secretly climbed onto the wagon and left the farm. The merchant took me back to his home, cooked us a delicious meal. I was immersed in the joy of escaping. But after hearing the merchant speak, I realised the real nightmare was only just beginning.

After regaining some energy, I accidentally found a fidget spinner inside the package box. So I started playing with it without thinking. But when it finally stopped spinning, something suddenly clicked in my mind. I immediately looked up at the air cooler above me. A bold idea flashed through my head. I grabbed a steel pipe from the shelf and aimed it at the fan cover of the cooler. Using the lever principle, I kept pressing hard. Soon I managed to pry the cover loose. Then I lifted the pipe again, aimed at the spinning fan blades, and with my frozen hands. I struck with all my strength, but the pipe was bounced right off. Sharp pain shot through my frostbitten hands. The fan kept spinning wildly, and the temperature in the freezer had dropped to minus 17 degrees. I was already falling into despair. But when I saw the little mouse struggling to stay alive, I tucked it into my coat to keep it from freezing. Just as I was ready to give up, my fingers touched a lighter inside my bag. I hurried to light it up. It was only a tiny flame, but it instantly gave me hope. Then I took out my college admission letter and set it on fire without hesitation. The big flame Immediately brought warmth to my body. The temperature in the freezer slowly began to rise. Just when things started to look better, thick smoke made me cough hard as a college student. I suddenly realized if this went on, I would soon suffocate from the smoke. So I reluctantly put out the fire using a piece of cardboard. But the moment the flame died, a wave of freezing cold rushed back at me. Then, in the burned remains, I found something surprising. The image on it suddenly gave me an idea. I used every bit of my strength to stand up and began moving boxes inside the freezer. After a lot of effort, I managed to build a small makeshift igloo. It wasn't airtight, but it could block out most of the cold wind. Then I curled up inside the tiny space and kept lighting the lighter again and again, hoping the small flame could keep me alive until rescue came. But after just two and a half minutes, the lighter ran out of fuel and I could no longer hold on. I passed out completely. When I woke up again, I saw the little mouse lying motionless on the ground. Being my only companion like that. I tried to reach over to check on it, but sudden pain shot through my arm. That's when I realized my arm had frozen to the cardboard beneath me. I had no choice but to tear it free by force. When I finally Got to the mouse. It was completely frozen. My last bit of hope vanished and I no longer had the strength to go on.

Drawn by the smell of blood, the officer noticed it, too, and quickly swam back, holding the bird. Tom and Jack tried to help, but the pistol jammed. At the worst moment, they had no choice but to paddle with their hands to buy the officer some time. Just as the shark was about to catch up, the officer reached the raft and climbed back just in time before the shark could bite. They narrowly escaped. Looking at the massive shark beneath them, the three were filled with fear. Thankfully, the food was still intact. Without resting, they split the bird into three parts and ate. But the meat was barely enough to keep them going. They were still hungry. Even worse, Jack discovered they had drifted off course. They were getting farther and farther from land. The captain had known this for a while, but kept it secret to avoid panic. The two men didn't blame him. Instead, they pulled out the sea chart and encouraged him to recheck the direction and lead them out of the ocean. With their encouragement, the Captain was no longer discouraged. He used a knife to cut open his shoes, threw away the uppers, then poked two holes in the soles to turn them into makeshift paddles. They began rowing toward the newly confirmed direction, but before they got far, the sky darkened. Storm was coming. The captain quickly told them to put on life vest, but before he finished speaking, a giant wave slammed into them. The powerful water tossed the captain into the sea. He struggled back to the raft, but before he could catch his breath, an even bigger wave hit, flipping all three into the ocean. The paddles were also lost. The experienced captain told the two men they had to flip the life raft in the direction of the sea wind. If not, everyone would drown in the ocean. One, two, 3! The three worked together and finally flipped the raft back over. They climbed aboard again and endured the relentless rain and waves. By morning, the storm finally ended, but the three were completely exhausted, barely able to keep their eyes open. Their weak bodies soon gave out and they all passed out. No one knew how long had passed before they slowly woke up. Around them was still nothing but endless ocean. Jack and Tom broke down. Even the captain gave up hope. He was unbearably thirsty and scooped up seawater, drinking it despite knowing the danger. Maybe fate finally took pity on them. Just when they had given Up all hope. They suddenly spotted land not far away. The three were overjoyed. Hope was right in front of them. Gave them a sudden burst of strength. They started paddling non stop, heading toward land.

A few seconds later, the van pulled up beside her. The door slammed shut and the van sped away. The girl was lying unconscious in the back of the van. The girl disappeared without a trace. The case remained unsolved after years of investigation. But one day, eleven years later, this girl with dark circles under her eyes, suddenly stumbled onto the street. Concerned citizens quickly called an ambulance. Gemma, the mother, heard that her daughter had returned. With tears in her eyes, she told her husband the news.

Perhaps the girl, Sophie, still had a chance of survival. At this point, Alice looked distressed. She did indeed know Sophie.

The couple thought nothing worse could happen, but reality always defies expectations. A nurse informed them of the test results. Alice had stretch marks, which meant she had given birth before. The police launched a large scale search in the forest based on Alice's escape route, but ultimately found nothing. Alice eventually returned home. Gemma comforted her daughter and urged her to rest. Early after her parents left, she fidgeted with her fingers and a strange smile appeared on her face. She returned to her room and looked at the children's photos. A strange feeling gradually emerged. She felt that their daughter was a bit unfamiliar. She told her husband about her discovery, but he didn't think much of it and comforted her, perhaps because Alice had suffered too much. At that moment, doorbell rang. It was Julian, the detective in charge of another kidnapping case. Upon learning that Alice and Sophie had been imprisoned together, he had come from France to Germany to investigate the case. Alice told Julian she had escaped from the basement. She had also considered taking Sophie with her, but Sophie had been so tortured that she had completely lost the ability to walk. So in the end, she couldn't take her. Julian asked Alice if she could find the escape route if she were to return to the forest. Alice's answer was Full of holes. Julian quickly sensed something was off. Just as he was about to press further, Sam noticed his daughter's reluctance and ruthlessly made Julian leave. Alice made a small gesture that caught his attention. He felt it was familiar. Julian reviewed the footage from before Sophie's disappearance. He noticed that Sophie, under stress, made the same small gesture as Alice. Perhaps Alice was not the real Alice, but Sophie, who had been missing for years. Just as he was at his wits end, some good news arrived. Alice had agreed to Julian's proposal to search for the place where they were being held captive. Before leaving, Gemma brought a yellow scarf. She deliberately said it was knitted by Alice and her teacher, but Alice corrected her, saying it was knitted by her and her classmates. The mother was puzzled by her own actions. She didn't know why she was testing her daughter. Under the dual Protection of the military and police, Alice felt her way into the depths of the forest. Alice suddenly stopped in her tracks. Before her was an invisible trench. The girl instantly became frightened and anxious. The military immediately sent someone to investigate. Julian, to confirm his suspicions, found a way to approach Alice and talk to her, Sophie.

The neighbor hurried to check on the owner of the garments, only to find that the woman's lower garments were soaked with bright red blood. The neighbor quickly informed the old woman's husband of the situation, yet the old man also seemed completely bewildered. Shortly after, the old man took his wife to the hospital for an examination. But after leaving the hospital, he secretly made a bold decision in his heart. He then contacted his children, who hadn't returned home for years, hoping to have one final reunion and share a warm meal together. But the children were either playing games or constantly taking phone calls. Each was wrapped up in their own affairs. No one paid any real attention to their parents feelings. Knowing his children were busy, the old man didn't say much. Trying to ease the awkward atmosphere, he quickly went inside and brought out handmade clay dolls he had carefully crafted for his grandchildren. Unexpectedly, his daughter in law found them unhygienic, took disinfectant and repeatedly cleaned the dolls. This scene was witnessed by an old friend of the family who couldn't stand the way the old man's children were behaving. Just as he was about to scold them angrily, his own wife stopped him. The old father saw it all, his heart aching, but he could do nothing. He could only invite his old friend To drink with him to numb the pain. But as soon as they started, the eldest daughter in law complained they were being too loud. The old man had to gesture silently to keep things quiet. They say children are the light of one's later years, but the sons and daughters before him had long seen their parents as a burden. They trampled all over years of parental love and sacrifice, unaware that this would be the last time they would see their parents. The family gathering ended hastily. The mother, suffering from alzheimer's, looked at her children and grandchildren around her. Though she couldn't remember all their names, deep in her mind she knew they were her beloved family. Tears welled up in her eyes. How she wished her children would visit more often. With great effort, she said, hearing their mother talk incoherently, the children simply turned and left, leaving the lonely old couple watching them go. Afterward, the old man carefully washed the dishes, collected the dried clothes from the line and tidied the house one last time under the lamplight. His wife was unusually quiet, not restless or noisy. The old man couldn't understand why his and his wife's life had been so hard. His lifelong partner first developed alzheimer's and now she had late stage intestinal cancer. Their children, busy with their own lives, rarely visited. The old man collected scrap to make ends meet while caring for his sick wife. Apart from basic expenses, He never spent a penny unnecessarily, saving all the extra money for his youngest daughter. Yet every time she came, she wouldn't even step inside. She took the money and left without a second glance. Now, his wife's condition was critical. Watching her take handfuls of painkillers daily with little relief, the old man wished he could bear the pain for her.

But what I clean isn't just ordinary trash. It's crime scenes. I used to be a doctor, but my son got seriously ill. I had to bring him to America for treatment. And in order to have more time to care for him, I had to work as a janitor. One day after finishing my cleaning duties, I accidentally witnessed a Mafia murder. I hid in a corner, too scared to make a sound. But just then, that damn phone of mine rang. They found me and dragged me in front of their leader. I begged them not to kill me to save my life. I told them I was a former doctor and that I could help them clean up the blood at the crime scene perfectly. If you wait, the blood will seep in the cement. It needs to be spoken there to clean the blood. I told them I needed to use sodium hydroxide. Not hot water, cold water only. After hearing my professional explanation, the Mafia boss agreed to let me try. I put on my gloves and started cleaning. Not long after, I had perfectly cleaned all the blood stains. The boss seemed to appreciate my skill and had someone drive me back home. I knew this wasn't over. Back home, I was terrified. But when I saw my son sleeping, I had to silently bear it. The next day, I took my son to the hospital to Inquire about the bone marrow donation process. But the receptionist told us our visa had expired. We're now illegal immigrants, and the hospital had suspended the donation process. I pleaded for some leeway, but they said it was their policy. We had no choice but to leave. Just as we were about to leave, I saw one of the Mafia members waiting for us. He took us to the Mafia's turf. When I saw the boss, I asked why he was following me. I hadn't told anyone about what happened yesterday. He handed me a bundle of money and a phone, saying I did a good job yesterday and this was my reward. And he hoped I would continue working for them. Why do you want me to work for you? Because I like you. And I don't want to have to kill you. I want you to take this and think on it. I knew I couldn't keep working for them, but my son's treatment needed a lot of money. Hesitantly, I took the money and phone. Just as I got home, I received a call from the hospital. They asked me to come back, as they would proceed with the bone marrow donation process. I couldn't believe it. The Mafia boss had helped me behind the scenes. And just like that, step by step, I walked deeper into the abyss.

At first, I had no idea what was happening. When I finally found a water source, I drank without hesitation. The next second, I was back in the desert. This cycle continued for 300 years. I finally figured it out. The problem was with that water source. This time, I chose to walk straight across the water without drinking a drop. The curse didn't trigger. I found a highway and flagged down a car to get home. The driver handed me a bottle of water and parked as I was. I drank it immediately. Tragedy struck again. I was back in the desert. The water in the bottle had turned to sand. Fuck! To get home, I dragged my exhausted body back to the highway. After flagging down the same car, I refused the water the driver offered and finally made it home. Lying on the couch, I heard the sound of dripping water. Only then did I realize I hadn't drunk water in hundreds of years. I turned on the tap and filled a glass to the brim, even adding a few ice cubes. After my experience with eating sand, I was extra cautious this time. I dipped my finger in and tasted a drop. I waited. Nothing happened. I continued carefully tasting it with my finger. Still nothing. Perfect. I down the entire glass in one go. Thinking the curse was broken, I jumped straight into the Pool outside. Just as I was savoring the moment, a mouthful of sand nearly choked me. I broke down. What the hell did I do wrong? Driven by sheer determination, I made my way back to the city. Once more. Looking at the bustling streets, I suddenly remembered. Once someone dying of thirst had asked me for water, and I'd refused. I quickly stopped a passing woman and asked if she could spare me some water. She refused, saying the water was for her dog. The next second, she vanished. I knew where she'd gone.

That day, just like any other, I went to play the piano for the wife of a wealthy man. When she opened the door, I could feel that she didn't want me to come in. But since I had already taken her husband's deposit, she eventually let me in. Not long after I started playing, I smelled something strange. Following the scent, I found a dead body in the living room. Then I finally understood why she hadn't wanted to let me in. At first, I pretended to stay calm and casually said I needed to use the bathroom. As I walked through the living room, I intentionally stepped into some water on the floor so I would look more like a real blind person. Once I entered the bathroom, I realized the killer was right behind me holding a gun. I held my breath and tried not to make any movement that could expose me. Fortunately, he didn't suspect anything. When I passed the living room again, I saw the face of the dead man. Clearly, it was the wealthy man who had hired me. I forced myself to stay calm and went back to the piano to continue playing. After leaving her house, I hesitated about whether I should call the police. The man had been known for his generosity and always Tipped me whenever he hired me. In the end, I went to the police station and said I wanted to report a case. But before I could finish speaking, I saw the man who had been hiding in the bathroom. He was wearing a police uniform. I froze. He was the chief of police. Luckily, I reacted quickly and changed my story immediately, saying that my cat had been killed. The chief's eyes were cold as a knife. He had just killed a man and now the only witness was sitting right in front of him. He clearly suspected that I wasn't really blind. He insisted on taking me home himself. As soon as we arrived, he noticed a newspaper on my table. I said it was there to line the trash bin, but he obviously didn't believe me. He kept testing me. At one point, he even threw a small knife near my head. I didn't move. Fortunately, he didn't see through my act. The next day, the rich man's body was found floating by the river. His wife cried bitterly during the interview. Later, the police chief blamed the murder on a young man. I was called in to give a statement and had to listen to them fabricating the entire report. My palms were sweating. I wanted to stand up and tell the truth, but that was just a fantasy. I knew that if I spoke up, I would end up like that rich man, dead. I. Thought everything was over, but then a twist appeared. At the funeral, the man's wife kept talking about what had happened before his death, unaware that during the murder, she and the chief had overlooked someone, the old lady next door. After the funeral, that old lady went to the police and said the rich man's wife was lying. When the wife found out, she went to the old lady's house and knocked on her door. At that time, I happened to have been hired by the rich man's daughter as her private tutor. When the elevator doors open, I saw with my own eyes the rich man's wife pushing the old lady down the stairs. My legs went weak. I almost collapsed. I forced myself to stay calm and pretended I hadn't seen anything. I didn't know whether the old lady was killed because she provided evidence. But I believe that woman had gone insane. She wanted to eliminate everyone who knew the truth. I wanted to escape, but before I could step outside, someone knocked on my door.

It actually tastes pretty good. I try eating some grass on the ground and it's surprisingly delicious. The whole forest seems like it's made of food. I cautiously walk deeper into the island, when suddenly a loud noise breaks the silence. I look closely and see countless mongooses standing in the middle of a pool. They look up at me, but don't attack. I don't care about them. I just want to take a bath. I shoot them away and without hesitation jump into the water. The comfort of it feels amazing. I can't help but swim around. Just as I finish and prepare to rest, I see the tiger has arrived to enjoying a meal. Strangely, the mongooses don't seem to care about the predator. Seeing the tiger so content, I smile. But by night, the mongooses suddenly scatter in all directions. I'm confused. Even the tiger quickly runs back to the boat. Soon, the mongoose is gathering the trees. They were just looking for a place to sleep. But then I noticed something terrifying. The pool suddenly glows brightly and dead fish float up. Their bodies look corroded, exposing their white bones. I don't understand what this means. The tiger sits quietly on the boat, clearly not daring to approach the island anymore. The whole island feels eerie. Like a human like being. Driven by curiosity. I pluck a strange flower from the tree. When I break It open! There's a human tooth inside. I can't believe what I'm seeing. This place could be a cannibal island. I know I need to leave. The next morning, I leave with a boat full of food, including roots and over 100 mangoses. Should last me and the tiger for a while. After we left, no one ever saw that Cannibal Island again. When we run out of food, the tiger goes fishing. But it's not good at it, always coming back empty handed. I watch, laughing. Suddenly, the tiger swims toward me. I realize the danger and quickly swim back to the boat. Tiger and I play like friends. Luckily, there's still a fishing net on the boat. I put some food scraps in the net and soon a fish bites. But this fish is huge and I can barely control it. I have to use a rock to kill it. Here's fall! As I tell the fish. I didn't want to kill, but I had to for survival. I give the whole fish to the tiger, because I'm afraid it will eat me if it's too hungry. Sometimes food falls from the sky. Especially when a school of flying fish migrates. They come in such huge numbers, I have to use my hands to protect myself from being hit. But the tiger doesn't care. It happily enjoys the feast. I don't know how long we've been drifting, but eventually land appears. I pull the boat to shore and The tiger jumps off. It stretches its thin body, then walks toward the trees without looking back. I hope it will stop and look at me once. After waiting for a long time, it just keeps staring at the trees. Hours later, a passing fisherman finds me. I cry like a child. But it's not from being saved. It's because the tiger has left me.

The anesthesia kept her deep asleep and I leaned closer. My hands wouldn't leave her. My lips brushed her skin. For 28 long minutes, I didn't stop. Only when her parents burst into the room did I finally let go. The father called me a hero for saving his daughter. The mother kissed me on the cheek, overflowing with thanks. But none of that mattered to me. My eyes stayed on Lisa, still lying helpless on that bed. That moment, I swore I would make her mine, no matter the cost.

They couldn't imagine something so vile inside a hospital, but they were too naive. Once they left, I returned, pretending it was routine rounds.

I kept insisting I was only changing dressings. Her mother, uneasy, asked Lisa herself. Hearing nothing unusual, she finally relaxed. Half a month later, Lisa was discharged. She only needed regular checkups moving forward. Before leaving, she gave me a hug and gratitude. Her mother noticed my hand wandering but stayed silent. That silence only fueled my obsession. Lisa's face lingered in my mind day and night. A week later, my assistant said Lisa was back. I freshened my breath and rushed to see her. She brought me a doll and a thank you note. When she mentioned studying medicine, I eagerly offered help. Her mother grew uneasy at my enthusiasm. She warned Lisa not to wear short skirts or low cut tops, but Lisa ignored her, caught in her rebellious phase. Mother's instincts were right. I began following Lisa, waiting where she ate. I paid off her friends just to get her alone. At first, she thought nothing of it. But when my hand reached for her, she froze in fear. She made an excuse and walked away fast. Her rejection pierced me like a blade. I kicked over trash cans to vent my rage. Later, Lisa told her parents everything. She begged them to change her doctor. Her father thought she imagined it all. He trusted my awards, my reputation, my past patients. He thought a man like me couldn't do such things. Her mother stood by Lisa, certain I was dangerous. At last, the father confronted me. I laughed in his face, saying I was no criminal. I claimed physical contact was part of treatment. Then I showed him the doll and letter she gave me. I hinted she was the one being forward. He was speechless, but still asked to switch doctors. I warned him it would harm her care. I told him I was the best surgeon money could buy. Reluctantly, he gave in. Her mother followed his Decision. That night, I hid near Lisa's house. When the family left, I slipped inside. I lay on her bed, breathing her scent. I imagined her in my arms, mine at last. Suddenly, she came home with her boyfriend. I panicked and hid in the storage room. I watched him pull out a ring and propose. He kissed her while whispering sweet lies. My chest felt like it was being torn apart. I wanted to attack him, to rip him away from her. Only her unhealed wound stopped him from going further. That night, I broke completely. All I thought about was tearing them apart. Soon the chance came. Her boyfriend had a leg injury and came often for treatment. I stole his phone while he wasn't looking. I sent cruel messages about Lisa to his friends. One of them linked it straight to Lisa. Enraged, she broke up with him. Immediately, the boy tried to prove his innocence with alibis. He realized the timing pointed straight at me. He stormed in demanding answers. I denied it, but he saw through everything. He knew I wanted Lisa for myself. Rage took over him completely. He grabbed his crutch and swung it at me. Come on.

I know this damn self! I'm not closing properly again. I just. I thought my plan was flawless, but I didn't expect my wife to say she'd already sent this couch to Jack, and Jack was about to come move the couch. No sooner had she finished speaking, then there was a knock at the door. At that point, I planned to wait until Jack moved the couch outside, and I would figure out a way to take the secretary away. But I didn't expect Jack to want to disassemble the couch before moving it. Seeing that, I hurriedly sat on the couch and pretended I couldn't bear to part with it. But inside, I was terrified. Luckily, at that moment, our son started crying upstairs. I quickly asked my wife to go feed the baby in the bedroom. As soon as my wife left, Jack tried to take the couch apart. I rushed over and held the couch down. I lied that my secret savings were hidden inside it, so the couch had to Be moved out intact. And as a middle aged man, Jack really understood how I felt, so he agreed without hesitation. But while we were moving it, my wife interrupted me again. She remembered she had a few clothes inside the couch. To avoid making her suspicious, I had to offer to help her get the clothes. I thought I was careful enough not to be discovered, but to my surprise, Jack glanced inside the couch. Hey, what the hell? What? Just a bunch of spiders. You get scared enough? Thankfully, at that critical moment, the baby cried again upstairs. Hearing it, my wife had to go back to the room. Meanwhile, Jack saw the woman lying underneath. He wanted to pull her out to save her. But I frantically held the couch down and pulled out cash to give him, trying to get him to help me cover up the truth. But I didn't expect Jack to shove me aside because he wanted to rescue the woman. Seeing my secret about to be exposed, I grabbed the glass and knocked Jack unconscious. When my wife came out, she saw me cleaning up the broken glass, and Jack was nowhere to be found. I lied that Jack thought the couch was too old, so he didn't want it anymore. I thought that lie would fool my wife. Then I went to work, planning to deal with the two people in the couch after I finished.

Afraid that he would discover my secret, I quickly hid the money and pretended nothing had happened as I followed my friend out. I knew that once I left, I couldn't return here because the building was scheduled to be demolished in two hours. But I didn't want to miss this opportunity to get rich. As all my colleagues were clocking out, I used the excuse that I had forgotten my phone in the building to ask to return. I gave my friend the hundred dollar I found and asked him to keep it a secret. Then I secretly returned to the abandoned building and went back to where I found the money. I excitedly pulled out the bag and opened it to check. Sure enough, it was filled with cash. This meant I could retire early without having to work. Just as I was looking forward to my future life, I heard the sound of someone smashing a wall next door. I peeked out cautiously to look and saw a blond man wielding tools to smash the wall. It was clear he was also after the money. I rushed back to the room, packed the money back into the bag, and then sneaked away from behind him. As I was heading downstairs with the large sum of money, I noticed a man with a gun walking upstairs. Realizing the danger approaching, I began to feel nervous. Since there was only one way out, I had no choice but to return, but I accidentally kicked a steel pipe on the ground. The loud noise caught everyone's attention. Realizing I had been exposed, I hurriedly hid the money, but one of the gunmen came over. I quickly hid behind the curtains so he wouldn't see me. But when I looked up, I saw that the blond man was also hiding behind the curtains. It turned out they weren't working together. We stared at each other, neither daring to make a sound. Just as the tension reached its peak, the armed robber suddenly turned and left. It turned out they had caught my friend and found the hundred on him. The criminals realized my friend had discovered the hiding spot, so he immediately ordered his men to interrogate him. Hearing my friend's agonizing screams made me feel terrible. In the end, I couldn't resist peeking out to see what was happening, and saw a scene that would haunt me for the rest of my life. There, the sudden scream alerted everyone to the presence. I hurriedly grabbed all the money and tried to escape. But when I thought of how my friend had been killed because of me, I hesitated. So I decided to kill all the criminals to avenge my friend.

I swallow them all in one gulp. When the warden walks in for inspection, I fake a choke, spit the soybeans back out. One shot. Get this damn convict away from me. Get in firmery. The doctor takes one look at me and quickly makes a diagnosis. One injection would cure it, but I've drunk so much water that I can't hold it anymore. Doctor hands me a bedpan. I laugh and tell him this thing is way too small. I need 10 of them just to get through. That's when another inmate steps in and offers to take me to the toilet. So we walk over. What nobody knows is that inside this tiny cubicle, there's a hidden passage. I climb up on the toilet, tell the inmate to stand guard at the door, and I pull out a tool I hit earlier. Done taking off, I unlock the white. Once I'm inside, I shut it back down, making it look like nothing ever happened. The passage leads straight to the tool room. We take out a wooden plank, slide it underneath the truck. The moment the truck rolls out, you slip into the hollow space Inside the plank, when the vehicle passes through the checkpoint, the scanners don't pick up a thing. Then at a gas station stop, we crawl out, ditch the plank and bolt toward our friend's car. Just like that, we make it out of prison alive.

Since I had exceeded the 370 turn work requirement, the system decided to give me a reward. But when I received the reward, I found it was just a pen. What use is a pen here? Curse of the system. But when I saw today's task, I was stunned. The original 50 turn task had become 370 turns. What's more terrifying is that pushing the Millstone two times counts as one point. That means I have to complete 740 laps to finish my daily workload. People around me also heard my task. Originally everyone only needed to push 50 laps to complete their work.

The little girl initially thought I was joking until I told her to fetch toilet paper. After finishing, I had the older daughter empty it. That evening, when the parents returned, the girl told her mother about me using the toilet, but the mother didn't believe her at all. And the father even scolded his daughter, insisting she should be an honest child. Each to next day, my behavior escalated. I smeared expired yogurt on my finger and ordered the older daughter to eat it immediately. Though reluctant, the girl obeyed out of fear. Even more absurdly, I commanded her to eat it with her hands and lick the container clean. The parents remained completely unaware of any of this. When the couple returned from work, I would hypocritically prepare dinner for the family. My actions grew increasingly bizarre. After the mother left for work, I actually left the two children alone and hid. The little girl searched the entire room but couldn't find me. Helpless, she opened the door and leaned over the stairwell, looking down, seeing her older sister walk out. The younger brother crawled around on the floor. Suddenly, the boy started wailing. He had seen me hiding under the bed. I then crawled out with a grotesque expression, making all sorts of incomprehensible faces and even bit the boy on the shoulder. Fortunately, it was a close call, but no real harm. Was Done. Even one day the family went on a trip and took me along um, but I felt no gratitude. Seeing their wealthy, carefree life, I secretly resolved to stay in this household forever. However, the children would eventually grow up. A third child could solve this pressing problem. So I secretly searched online for remedies and added the purchased medication to their meals. I crushed the pills in a bowl and mixed them thoroughly into the family's food. My goal was to make them have a third child quickly so my job could be secure indefinitely. The plan failed because the mother, exhausted from work, went to bed early and the father spent all his free time scrolling through his phone on the couch. Seeing the plan fail, I immediately changed my demeanor. Watching their harmonious relationship, my thoughts grew increasingly twisted. If the children grew up or if the grandmother replaced me, I would face unemployment. The more I thought about it, the more resentful I became. E meanwhile, I privately entered the owner's room. Finally able to act without restraint, I went into the master bedroom first engaging in strange behaviors, even fixating on dandruff on the pillows. I trashed the room, scattering garbage everywhere. I knew that as long as I cleaned up before they return, there would be no issue. Then one day, while I was watching the children play in the park, I became careless and the older daughter went missing. Frantically, I searched Everywhere. And fortunately found her on a bench by the path. I picked her up, scolding her incessantly. Annoyed by my nagging, the little girl bit me. That bite, ironically, saved me once Joe. Later, the mother noticed a bruise on her son's shoulder and asked me about it. Sensing trouble, I quickly blamed the older daughter. Even showing the bite Mark on my own shoulder is proof that the older girl had a biting habit. Once again, the mother believed me, but she didn't know the nightmare was just beginning. After the incident in the park where the older daughter got lost, another terrible idea occurred to me. If only one child remained, would the mother try for another? The next day, I lost all interest in watching the children. I took out a fruit knife I had prepared earlier and filled the bathtub with hot water. Sensing something wrong, the older daughter hid under the bed. The soon after, the mother returned from work to a horrifying scene. I was dead. The room was in disarray. Blood was everywhere, and the two children were missing.

She generously praised me, but I humiliated her in return. I'm a businessman and I realized that everyone's time is worth something. So now we have enough money to buy a new dress. Lily was speechless for a moment, but my arrogant self thought I was doing her a favor. I told her to forget what happened last night and never contact me again. Soon, I arrived at the company. The boss asked me to meet with an important client and sign a contract. I confidently agreed, but the next second, I was completely shocked. And here is our client, Miss Papplemont. I'd like you to meet our best, specialist Beatles. I froze on the spot because I never expected Lily to be the company's big client. To keep my job, I had to pretend not to know her, but I messed up from being too nervous. It's hot here, isn't it? Maybe we should turn on the AC. Lily handed me remote control, but the boss said the air conditioner was already on. To cover my embarrassment, I started eating snacks. But even so, Lily didn't let me off. So show's turned. Under Lily's sharp gaze, I had no choice but to painfully present my project. But I kept making mistakes from nerves. Just as the deal was about to fail, the clueless boss stopped Lily. He defended me, saying maybe I just wasn't fully awake yet. But Lily knew exactly what I was doing last night, so she refused to accept his excuse. What she didn't expect was that the boss decided to fire me to save the deal. Lily realized that wasn't what she wanted, so she came up with a better idea. I'll sign the contract then on my opinion. She handed a note to the boss, then walked toward me as I pretended to be on a call. Yeah, buddy, I'll be in 5 minutes. Ha, sure. When she saw I was holding the phone upside down, Lily gave a cold smirk and walked away. Then the boss called me into his office. He told me to pack up and go home. I thought I had been fired, but the boss said Lily had given me another chance. So to keep my job, I brought flowers to the place. Lily told me to meet her. I have to tell her something. I was wrong. But my apology didn't move her. She threw a pair of roller skates at me and told me to skate two laps with her. But she didn't know I couldn't skate at all. Do you need a hand? No, I'm fine. Why? Whoo, I'm riding. Give me your hand, Mister Izzy. Seeing how clumsy I was, Lily finally reached out her hand to help me, and our relationship grew closer. That's when I finally realized my mistake. I sincerely apologized to Lily, but what I didn't expect was that Just as I tried to get closer, Lily slipped $300 into my pocket.

I grabbed two straps and laid on the hood to catch some air. My friends were yelling from inside for me to come back, but I wanted more excitement. I told my friend driving to go faster. The engine roared like thunder. The speed hit 180 in seconds. I held the straps tight and screamed from the hood. My two friends saw how happy I was. Their fear turned into excitement. They cheered me on, then hit the gas even harder. That's when a creepy guy spotted me. He saw my long legs. A disgusting smile crossed his face. He started chasing us in his black car. I was still enjoying the rush on the hood. The creep caught up fast from behind. Abby saw him and warned Marcy. Before Marcy could react, the black car slammed into us. Our car lost control instantly, almost flipped over. The impact made my head spin. Lucky Marcie knew how to drive. She got the car steady again. The black car suddenly hit the brakes. We thought he was letting us go, but after creating distance, he floored it and came at us again. This hit was even harder. I almost flew off the hood. My friends screamed for me to hold on. Only one hand still gripped the strap. I tried to get back inside, but the creep wouldn't let up. He accelerated from Behind rammed our white car again. He gave us no time to breathe, kept slamming into our car. Marthy gripped the wheel with both hands, fighting to keep us balance. The creep got more excited seeing this. He crashed hard into our side. The white car spun 360 degrees. The strap flew out of my hands completely. I pressed flat against the hood, couldn't relax for a second. The creep still wouldn't stop. He gunned it at us again. A car came from the opposite direction. The creep lost control and hit the grass. We thought we finally lost it, but his black car appeared on the roadside again. He sped toward us, caught up to us fast. The creep was going for the final blow. Marcy thought quick. She yanked the wheel hard left. The creep couldn't react in time and went off road. The black car finally stopped. From that moment on, the hunter became the hunted. Because we three weren't ordinary people, he thought we had guns. Took off without a word. Watching the creep drive away, my two friends in the car got sad. Instantly, they thought I'd been thrown off and died. But the next second, oh, shit, shit. After what just happened, we decided to go after the black car for revenge. I grabbed a metal pipe from the roadside, sat on the window as we chased the black car. The black car driver was on the roadside treating his gunshot wound, had no Clue we were coming for him. Next second, his car went flying. I charged at him with the pipe.

Anger rushed through me and I shoved it away. But in that split second, I find myself standing on the edge of a bottomless abyss. I shouted my father's name with everything I had. I remembered we were hunting in the mountains. A crazed yak came charging straight at me and knocked me off the cliff. I clung tightly to a rock jutting out from the cliff, but it didn't hold for long. With a crisp crack, I plummet into the abyss once more. Luckily, I landed on a Flat Rock halfway down the mountain. I refused to give up. I started to climb down slowly. My fingers dug into the cracks between the stones. Suddenly, my hand slipped and there was nothing beneath my feet. Just as I was about to lose my grip, dark clouds rolled in. Rain poured down and water filled the bottom of the ravine. That water was my only chance. I tried to jump down, but it was way too high. If I didn't jump, death was the only thing waiting for me. I clenched my teeth and threw myself off. When I opened my eyes again, it was the next day. I struggled to crawl out of a pool of thick MUD. One of my legs was completely ruined. I crawled to a puddle and drank the filthy water like a starving animal. Then I pulled out my swollen foot. I wedged two Stones against it and took a deep breath. I gritted my teeth and forced the bone back into place. Then I tied my leg with sticks and made a crude brace. I limped up the mountain. At the top, I saw a grave. My name was carved on the stone. Everyone thought I was dead. My father had LED the tribe away. I fell to my knees, completely breaking down. Suddenly, a wolf's howl echoed through the valley. I looked up and saw a pack of wolves closing in. I ran the other way, dragging my bad leg, but the wolves were faster. They quickly caught up to me. I tried to climb a tree, but a wolf latched onto me from behind. I pulled out my knife and stabbed down hard. I finally broke free and climbed up to the tree top. The wolves waited below through the night. When morning came, they were gone. Only one injured grey wolf remained. I made a spear from a knife and a branch. I raised the spear high, ready to deliver the final blow. The wolf let out a whimpering plea for mercy. I froze for a moment. In the end, I softened. I was still scared it might attack, so I tied its mouth shut with a rope. I dragged it to the river and cleaned its wounds. The next morning, the gray wolf had already freed itself from the rope. It stared at me intently. I lifted a bowl. Of water and approached slowly. When it saw I meant no harm, it relaxed. It began drinking the water in Big Gulps. I found some bugs to eat, even though I was nearly fainting from hunger, but I shared half with it. This little food was nowhere near enough. Next day, I went hunting. I spotted a rabbit in the grass. I grabbed a rock and smashed it down. That night, I Learned how to start a fire. It was the first time I had warm roasted rabbit. The grey wolf was drooling with desire. I told it to behave if it wanted food. It seemed to understand and lowered its head. I threw a bone to it. Next day, I decided to head back to the tribe. I told it to go back and find its own pack, but no matter how I tried to drive it away, it refused to leave. I threw a stick to scare it away, but it just brought it back, wagging its tail. So we walked together. I named it Alpha. With alpha, hunting became easy. Food was no longer a problem. Every morning it woke me right on time. Then one day, a blizzard hit. Suddenly, we crawled into a cave to take shelter. I was just catching my breath when Alpha started growling. I followed the direction of its gaze. A massive, dark figure emerged. Slowly. It was an ancient black panther. Then it lunged at me with incredible speed.

I got lucky and received 5 kilos of flower on my retirement day. Afterwards, I did not call the police. Instead, I took the stash back to the gang because I wanted to join them selling flower. And my age made me perfect for the job because all of Tony's guys were on the police blacklist. Well, I had never broken the law and had no record. The police would never suspect an old man of selling flower. Tony thought that made perfect sense, so he cut off a kilo and gave it to me. Actually, Tony was just curious and wanted to try it out. What he did not expect was I would become the gang's top seller. When I got home, I ran into trouble. I had to divide the block of flour into small packets to sell, but the stuff was rock hard. Even a power saw could not cut it. In the end, I shattered it with a cleaver. After I finished packing it up, a new problem came up. I forgot to ask Tony the selling price when we met. There was no choice, so I went to my son in law, who was a narcotics officer to get information. Asking the price directly was obviously unwise, so I pretended I just wanted to know more about his job. Mark unsuspectingly took me Straight into their records room and there I found the exact same flower listed in the files. Now everything was ready, but I still didn't have any buyers. So I had to go to the hangouts where thugs gather to look for them. I asked everyone I met if they needed flower, but they all thought I was an undercover cop and refused to buy. Through persistence, I finally found my first buyer. Once I made the first deal, they realised I wasn't a cop since my product was pure and the quantity was solid. More and more buyers came to me every day. Soon, all my goods were sold out. When I handed the money over to Tony, everyone there was shocked. Seeing how capable I was, Tony gave me even more goods this time. I thought in just a few months I'd be driving a sports car. But the moment I walked out of Tony's apartment, the next second I was locked onto by a nearby drug sniffing dog.

This was our plan to smuggle the $5 million we'd stolen out of the country. But there was so much money that I had to wrap the rest tightly around her stomach. Before long, she looked like she was eight months pregnant. If we could just make it through airport security, we'd have more money than we could spend in several lifetimes. To avoid suspicion, we deliberately entered the security area separately, one after the other. Sure enough, when the security staff saw she was pregnant, they waved her through without asking many questions. But just as my girlfriend glanced back at me, I was suddenly stopped by an officer. She looked nervous, but had no choice except to keep her cool and keep moving forward. Turns out my passport had no entry or exit stamps. Fortunately, I stayed calm and after some quick talking, managed to ease the security officer's suspicions. Next came the most critical part. The full body scan, or hearts were in our throats. If anything went wrong, not only would our whole plan fall apart, but we'd be fat being life in prison. I thought we'd covered all our bases. But to my shock, the moment my girlfriend walked through the metal detector, a piercing alarm blared. My heart nearly stopped. Thankfully, my girlfriend Jana quickly removed the necklace from around her neck, which resolved the crisis and allowed her to pass through without further incident. To avoid drawing any more attention, we picked up our pace. Thinking about how we'd soon escape the law and start our new lives as wealthy people, we couldn't help but smile.

They hurried their pace. The woman picked up a stone from the ground and gestured for him to use it to break the window. Seeing the drenched, beautiful neighbor, the man quickly took off his jacket, wrapped the stone, and climbed up to smash the glass. He then crawled through the window and opened the door from inside. Just as he was about to leave, the grateful woman called out to stop him. He followed her into the room. The woman took out a first aid kit and slowly knelt down to treat the cut on his hand.

She says if she waters it 20,000 times, the stone will grant her any wish. But I never believed her. I grabbed a crowbar and knocked the stone over. Then I picked it up and carried it away. The villagers quickly put their hands together and prayed devoutly. But to their surprise, I carried the stone straight under the waterfall. Then I told my mother, this way we could water it 50,000 times at once. But soon something strange happened. A mask suddenly fell to my feet. From that day on, I couldn't stop staring at it, until one day I accidentally traced the outline of the face on the mask. I slowly drew out the person's features, and somehow I felt my heart race. So I ran toward the top of the waterfall. When I reached the source, I saw a fairy covered in colorful butterflies. I leapt toward her with all my strength, but just as I grabbed a branch, she vanished. Following her guidance, I climbed through the waterfall for three days and nights. Finally, I made a bow and arrow from branches. I jumped and fired an arrow. The sword pierced through a tall tree and got stuck at the top. I finally made it to the summit. The fairy was right in front of me. Just as I reached out to touch her, Annie turned into a butterfly and flew away. I searched the forest for her traces. Suddenly, I heard a scream. I ran to check it out. I saw Annie running out of the woods with soldiers chasing behind her. It was clear she was being hunted. To protect her, I followed them closely. When the soldiers were about to catch her, Annie shouted a mysterious spell. A sword flew through the air. He turned around and the blade pierced through the soldier's body. Then the rest of the soldiers fell one by one. Turns out archers were hidden among the trees and he killed every soldier below without a single drop of blood on her. In that moment, I was completely captivated. So to catch her, I set a trap to lure her in. Soon she fell right into it. I happily came to take a look, but suddenly a sword pressed against my back. She had somehow gotten behind me and her sword pierced into my body. I told her I had already fallen in love with her. Then I held her tightly in my arms. Unfortunately, we rolled down the snowy mountain together. Annie was furious. She tried to strike me down, but I flipped backward and tore off her sleeve. Then I turned and pulled off her coat, lifted her long hair and washed her under the waterfall, crushed berries to draw eyeliner and lipstick on her face. She turned around and saw me holding the mask she had lost and she realized I had come for her. She was touched and Hugged me tightly, but she still had to rescue the princess, so she knocked me out and left alone. Not long after she left, an accident happened. A soldier threw a fishing net over her, catching her alive. When they tried to harm her, I showed up just in time. As the soldiers got closer, I pushed down a huge boulder. It stopped the pursuers, but unexpectedly the impact triggered a landslide. I quickly grabbed some tree bark and slid down the slope with Annie. Just as the snow was about to bury us alive, a cliff appeared ahead. I leapt forward with her and we both survived. Soon, I arrived at the palace where workers were raising a giant statue of the king. But suddenly, a slave slipped, triggering a chain reaction.

I had to make him believe that I had a happy family. While we were talking, my boss quietly walked in. The woman didn't care what I thought. She just grabbed the money and left. My boss asked where my wife was. I looked around and finally locked my eyes on a quiet woman. Whoa, this is my wife. My boss smiled and greeted Annie, but Annie looked embarrassed. She had no idea what was going on right then. Mom, oh, you have a son, too. You didn't mention it. My boss warmly said hello. I gently patted the little boy's head. Luckily, my boss said he needed to use the restroom. That gave me a chance to explain what the hell is going on. Who are you? Please, please help me out. I lied to my boss about here and the family to make myself look committed. I can't get promotion without it, please. Annie immediately said she wouldn't take part in this. I froze for a second, then quickly turned to the boy. I told him he could order anything expensive he wanted from the menu. The boy smiled and said he was already 13. He wouldn't be bribed by just one Meal. So I pulled out my phone and told him if he convinced his mom, the phone would be his. The boy was thrilled and I successfully made a deal with them. From that moment on, we were bound together. The dinner was filled with laughter. My boss was very pleased with my family. He believed that an employee with a happy family would perform even better at work. He had already decided to promote me. I held back my excitement, never expecting Annie and her son to play their roles so perfectly. After my boss left satisfied, I quickly offered my most sincere thanks. At that moment, Annie's eyes on me began to change, and the way I interacted with the boy looks just like a real father and son. It gave me a warmth I had never felt before. When it was time to part, Annie laid down one rule, no kissing. It's the Vath. What's that? Nothing. Nothing. After watching them leave, I sat alone for a long time, replaying everything that just happened. I used to think work and money were everything, but now my whole mindset had changed. I realised true love was what I should really be chasing.

The hell? Damn it! Okay, where are you? You won't fly far from me, little bird. She ran outside asking drivers for help. But their prices completely shocked her. Oh, for like 50 bucks, I can get you out of here like the wind. No money? I think there's one more way of payment I would accept from you, if you know what I mean. She tried to offer her phone as collateral, but what she saw next left her terrified. That's when kind hearted Jack offered to help for free. But the older driver next to him mocked him for getting involved. Soon the boyfriend caught up, but the driver refused to tell him anything. I get it. Um, look, maybe this will help you remember faster. Faced with temptation, the driver quickly pointed out Annie's escape route. I'll give you everything in here if you help me catch the mom. That's no problem. Get in my car. They caught up to her in no time. Just as the boyfriend tried to drag her away, Jack stepped in to protect her. I see you're a man of your principles. Give you twice as much if you let the girl go. Jack glanced at Annie sitting in the car and came up with a plan. Good boy. So you thought you could run away from me? Yes. As the man climbed inside to search, Jack hit the Button and locked the doors. He'll sit here until the cops come. Let me out! Thank you. The older driver couldn't understand Jack's actions at all. I mean, the money was literally in your hands, and you still didn't take it. Some things are more important than money. One month later, Annie came looking for Jack again.

But during the college entrance exam, I couldn't even move my pen. Because in every test before, Tony had always helped me answer the questions. But that day, Tony got stuck in traffic. Looking at my incomplete hands, I suddenly felt completely helpless. I didn't want my three years of hard work to go to waste. So I tried to flip open the paper with my mouth and bite the pen just to write my name. But no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't do it. When the exam ended, I was filled with despair. In a fit of hopelessness, I went straight to the rooftop. At that moment, I wanted to end my miserable life. Because before the exam even started, when Tony still hadn't shown up, I tried asking strangers passing by for help. But not a single person was willing to lend a hand. In the end, I placed my last hope on the Proctor. But to my shock, even the teacher gave up on me. Now I no longer have the right to blame anyone. What made it worse was that the minister of the Interior's daughter decided to go shopping that day. So she used her father's power to block off the roads, which accidentally trapped Tony halfway. By the time Tony finally reached school, it was already too late. As he rushed desperately toward the rooftop, he heard the screams of the crowd. Below. Because I had chosen to end my life. Seeing this, Tony was devastated. At the same time, my brother also arrived. He had gotten my message asking for help. But he too was stuck in traffic. He had even asked a police officer by the roadside for help. But the officer's response left him heartbroken. And just like that, death separated me and my brother forever. But my brother wanted to seek justice for me. So he went straight to the police station to report the minister's daughter. Yet when the chief heard his words. He just gave a subtle signal to his men. And quietly passed the message to the minister. Little did he know. That same night, my brother was kidnapped by gangsters. And brutally tortured to death. In this city, the minister's word was law. He wouldn't allow anyone to threaten his power. But there was one man who couldn't stand the evil. And that man was Tony.

Alright, get out of here. Come on! I don't want your fucking money. You know what the fuck he is? Just like that, I effortlessly walked away with the $100,000 prize money. After I left, some gambling addict dude lost his shirt, started following me. You just lost me 500 bucks, asshole. The next second, he grabbed a knife and lunged at me. I didn't even bother dodging. Hell, I still had that relaxed look on my face. The guy's heart sank when he saw that and he turned tail and ran like his life depended on it. I used to be the world middleweight fighting champion. But during one match, I lost control of my emotions. Even though I had already won. I ended up beating my opponent to death right there in the ring. What made it even more painful was that the guy was my friend. So I chose to retire and disappear. I found a small bar on a remote island. The locals here are tough as nails and the police can't be bothered to deal with anything. Previous bartender was a retired Marine, and even he only lasted Two days before he quit. But in my eyes, none of this was a problem. A bunch of bikers came rolling in and immediately started causing trouble. Not only did they chase away the customers, but they were also showing off and acting like they own the place. I watched them trash the joint while harassing the waitresses. I slowly got up and walked over. I told my coworker to go take care of the other customers. I could handle this situation myself. To keep the bar's equipment from getting destroyed, I suggested we take it outside to talk. Those are your bikes out there, right? Yeah, mine's a red one on the right. Wait, what the fuck? Wait, wait, wait. I asked them two simple questions. Uh, before we start, do you have insurance? What? I give medical insurance. Your coverage? Good. Like you have dental? Oh, ha, ha. Yeah. I'm not the one that's gonna fucking need it. Okay, sure. Hey, Frankie? Yeah? Is there a hospital nearby? Literally, who gives a shit? Shut the fuck up and fight, asshole. Is there a hospital nearby? Is it, like, too far? Is it close? like 25 minutes, I'd say, like, depending on the traffic. What time of day. Mo. Shut the fuck up. Hey, what's your name? Dell. Dell, you don't have to do this, man, I. You don't. You don't have to lose. You're gonna lose in front of all your friends, in front of. Oh, They're not here to just watch. Oh, cool. Well, that's hardly fair. Life's not fair. I just slapped you. Are you alright? What? Damn! Damn! Fuck him up! Come on! Damn. I guess. Oh, shit. Let's call this a draw. The fuck's a draw? It's kind of like a win, man. Like, I win. It's a tie, Dale. Yeah, like we win together, you know? Oh, fuck you. Within just a few minutes, those troublemakers were either nursing broken bones or head injuries. Out of the goodness of my heart, I even gave them a ride to the hospital and had the doctor take a look at my old injuries while I was there. Even though these guys weren't worth my time, I had no idea they were actually backed by a much bigger operation.

I got angry and asked what she was doing. She quickly apologized and said it was an accident. I didn't think much of it. I just bent down to pick up my scarf. But the moment I lowered my head, she suddenly shoved me hard from behind. I struggled desperately, but she slammed the lid shut. I heard her using a stick to lock it from outside. Fear started to rise inside me. Then I heard the sound of a car engine. She had tied the trash can to a vehicle. Just like that. I was dragged away like garbage. After her plan succeeded, the woman tore off her clothes, revealing a wedding dress. Underneath, she began her carefully planned fake runaway bride act. No one at the wedding had a clue. When the priest asked if the bride was willing to marry the groom, the woman suddenly said she wasn't. Tony was stunned, thinking he must have misheard. But before he could react, the woman ran over and kissed the best man. Seeing this, Tony was furious, thinking I had cheated on him. Without hesitation, he punched the best man. The next day, Tony drank himself numb at a bar. That's when the woman appeared again, disguised as a waitress. She deliberately walked up to him and started talking. Turns out she'd secretly had a crush on Tony all along. That's why she pretended to be me and ruined The wedding. While Tony was still lost in heartbreak, she secretly slipped sleeping pills into his drink. Having no idea Tony drank at all. Not long after, I finally escaped from the trash can and rushed home. But as soon as I opened the door, I saw my fiance in bed with another woman. I pounded on the door, shouting at him, asking why he would do this to me. But he said I was the one who ran away from the wedding. I froze, completely confused. He didn't give me a chance to explain. In anger, we both said we wanted to break up. Seeing the smug smile on that woman's face, I felt a terrible sense of dread. When Tony told me to pack up and leave, he suddenly noticed something. At the wedding, my nails were painted red, but now they were bare. He immediately realized something was wrong. He turned to look at the woman. She panicked and quickly hid her hands. That's when Tony finally understood. We had both been tricked. Once the truth came out, she was kicked out of the house. But as she left, her towel got caught in the door. She ran out naked, straight into the trash can. Ironically, just like how she had pushed me in that day, this time it was her turn to be dragged away like garbage.

Struggling, I tore it off. The golden egg was now covered in blood. Its six claws slowly retracted. At first, I paid it no mind, but by evening I felt an unusual thirst. Drinking copious amounts of water brought no relief. Only when I saw a plate of bloody raw meat did I realise I craved blood. I suppressed the urge, but my body grew feverish. The wound on my hand itched intensely. Fighting my palm or cutting it with a knife offered no relief. Suddenly, I realized the problem lay with the golden egg. So I retrieved the egg once more and placed it on my injured hand, claws extended, piercing my flesh and drawing blood. Miraculously, all discomfort vanished instantly. In its place came an overwhelming sense of comfort. I collapsed to the stairwell, reveling in the experience. Next day, I discovered I had grown younger through the golden egg's power. My wife was astonished by the change and delighted with my transformation. To understand why, I sought out an antique dealer. He revealed it was a device granting eternal life. But it would make the user dependent on human blood, eventually transforming them into bloodthirsty monster monsters. Yet the allure of immortality proved too great. I couldn't resist. In the days that followed, I began using the Golden egg frequently. Watching myself grow younger and younger filled me with joy. But disaster struck at a banquet, a Man suddenly began bleeding from his nose. This instantly ignited my desire. The scent of blood stirred an inexplicable restlessness within me. I followed him to the restroom. Even after he left, I began licking the blood stains from the sink. But just then, someone else emerged from the bathroom. I feigned composure, halting my bizarre actions. He cursed under his breath and wiped away the blood. My mood hit rock bottom. Just as I prepared to leave, I spotted a lingering bloodstain on the floor. I immediately dropped to my knees and began devouring it. But as I lost myself in the act, someone approached and kicked me unconscious.

I got lucky and received 5 kilos of flower on my retirement day. Afterwards, I did not call the police. Instead, I took the stash back to the gang because I wanted to join them selling flower. And my age made me perfect for the job because all of Tony's guys were on the police blacklist. Well, I had never broken the law and had no record. The police would never suspect an old man of selling flower. Tony thought that made perfect sense, so he cut off a kilo and gave it to me. Actually, Tony was just curious and wanted to try it out. What he did not expect was I would become the gang's top seller. When I got home, I ran into trouble. I had to divide the block of flour into small packets to sell, but the stuff was rock hard. Even a power saw could not cut it. In the end, I shattered it with a cleaver. After I finished packing it up, a new problem came up. I forgot to ask Tony the selling price when we met. There was no choice, so I went to my son in law, who was a narcotics officer to get information. Asking the price directly was obviously unwise, so I pretended I just wanted to know more about his job. Mark unsuspectingly took me Straight into their records room and there I found the exact same flower listed in the files. Now everything was ready, but I still didn't have any buyers. So I had to go to the hangouts where thugs gather to look for them. I asked everyone I met if they needed flower, but they all thought I was an undercover cop and refused to buy. Through persistence, I finally found my first buyer. Once I made the first deal, they realised I wasn't a cop since my product was pure and the quantity was solid. More and more buyers came to me every day. Soon, all my goods were sold out. When I handed the money over to Tony, everyone there was shocked.

Cuando vio a una persona mayor con bastón a su lado, el hombre amablemente le ofreció su asiento. Inesperadamente, la persona mayor, cortes mente, rechazó su amabilidad, así que no importa a qué hora tomara el autobús, siempre habría un asiento disponible para él. Pero el hombre se sintió muy desanimado porque claramente sabía que todo esto se debía a su rostro aterrador. Cuando acababa de nacer, su madre mostró una expresión extraña al verlo cuando fue al jardín de infancia. La maestra estaba tan asustada por su apariencia aterradora que se desplomó en el suelo. En la escuela primaria, solo tenía que mirar a alguien y todos compartían su comida con él. En su inocencia, pensó que había muchas personas buenas en el mundo. No fue hasta después de que entró a la escuela secundaria que nunca tuvo que hacer cola en ningún lugar. Fue entonces cuando se dio cuenta de que no era que todos fueran amables, sino que se veía aterrador. Por lo tanto, a los 35 años, nunca había tenido novia. En este momento, una chica linda caminó directo y se paró a su lado. Él miró a la chica con sorpresa después de ver su rostro. La chica no solo no lo evitó, sino que realmente sonrió y asintió saludándolo. Esta fue la primera vez que el hombre vio a alguien Sonreírle, lo que lo hizo desarrollar buenos sentimientos hacia la chica, pero el hombre sabía muy bien en su corazón que para él esta chica era como un ángel y no se atrevía a expresar su amor. Un día, mientras trabajaba en su propia tienda, inesperadamente encontró a la chica que hizo que su corazón palpitara. La última vez la reconoció de un vistazo desde el autobús. Resultó que la chica había sufrido de prosopagnosia desde la infancia y la apariencia feroz y amenazante del hombre era el único rostro que podía reconocer. Justo así, los dos rápidamente se enamoraron e ingresaron exitosamente a la sala del matrimonio, como una historia de amor de la bella y la bestia. Después de casarse, la pareja dirigía una floristería juntos, pero la apariencia del hombre asustaría a los clientes, así que cada vez que venía un cliente a comprar flores, él activamente daba la espalda y dejaba que su esposa los atendiera. Incluso así, la apariencia aterradora del hombre a veces haría que los agentes encubiertos que pasaban lo confundieran con un criminal buscado. El hombre estaba muy deprimido por que su esposa estaba a punto de dar a luz e iría a la casa de sus padres por tres meses mañana, pero con su apariencia aterradora no podía servir a los clientes que venían a comprar flores en la tienda. Por lo tanto, estaba muy preocupado y pidió consejo a amigos. En este momento, el dueño del salón de belleza activamente Se acercó y sugirió darle un cambio de imagen para hacerlo verse más amable. Porque 90 por 100 de la primera impresión de una persona depende de su peinado, decidió darle al hombre un permanente ondulado. Después del permanente, se volvió aún más aterrador. Todos vieron esto y no se atrevieron a hacer un sonido. En este momento. Varios estudiantes entraron al salón de belleza e inmediatamente fueron asustados por la apariencia del hombre gritando. Asustados, el hombre se sintió impotente y estaba a punto de rendirse cuando el diseñador principal del salón de belleza caminó confiadamente detrás de él y, sin dudarlo, cortó las puntas del cabello que había guardado durante muchos años. Conforme el tiempo pasaba lentamente, las expresiones de todos se volvieron gradualmente, tan sorprendidas que sus bocas no podían cerrarse. Después de que el hombre terminó su cambio de imagen y regresó a casa. Inicialmente, pensó que su familia no le gustaría. Inesperadamente, después de que su esposa lo vio rápidamente, preguntó a Ion qué tipo de mujeres le desagradaban

Después de cerrar la puerta, intentó separar sus dedos de los pies. Un dolor agudo la atravesó inmediatamente. En ese momento, vino un golpe en la puerta. Era porque el pez Dorado en el tanque desapareció frente a las preguntas de su madre. Daisy no sabía cómo responder porque hace poco la chica había llegado a casa, sintiéndose extremadamente hambrienta, pero no tenía apetito por ninguna comida regular. Sin embargo, al ver el pez Dorado en el tanque, Daisy lo devoró ávidamente. Al final, solo pudo mentirle a su madre diciendo que había tirado el pez Dorado al inodoro. Su madre estaba furiosa e inmediatamente escondió a Daisy. Al día siguiente, Daisy fue sola al hospital. El doctor, al ver los dedos de Daisy, pensó que era una deformidad congénita. Dijo que solo requeriría una cirugía simple, pero Daisy le dijo al doctor que había sucedido solo el día anterior. El doctor estaba muy sorprendido. Examinó nuevamente los dedos de Daisy. El doctor le pidió a Daisy que se hiciera un análisis de sangre primero, pero Daisy notó que el doctor parecía estar hablando con alguien por teléfono, sintiendo que algo andaba mal. Daisy inmediatamente huyó del hospital. Regresando a casa, Daisy ojeó el álbum de fotos, pero no pudo encontrar ninguna Foto de su madre embarazada. Cuando le preguntó a su madre al respecto, su madre lo evadió evasivamente. En el supermercado, Daisy compró tijeras y vendas. Decidió separar sus dedos de los pies por su cuenta. Soportando el dolor intenso, Daisy cortó sus dedos de los pies fusionados. Luego vendó la herida. Otro día, en el baño, Daisy descubrió que su ombligo había desaparecido. Los moretones también habían aparecido en todas sus piernas. Sin poder aceptar esto, Daisy se desmayó en su estado de aturdimiento. Sintió como si estuviera en el océano. Cuando se despertó nuevamente, descubrió que había mudado de piel. Asustada de que sus padres descubrieran, Daisy escondió la piel mudada. Luego se apresuró a ir a la escuela. Durante una clase de laboratorio de ciencias, viendo la carne de pescado fresco, Daisy sintió un impulso insoportable. Cuando nadie estaba cerca, ya no podía controlarse y agarró el pez, metiéndoselo en la boca. Otra chica presenció su comportamiento, asustada de que la chica la delatara. Daisy la amenazó. Esa noche, en una fiesta de playa, escuchó gritos pidiendo ayuda. Resultó que su buena amiga se estaba ahogando. Daisy saltó al mar para rescatar a su amiga. Después de encontrar a su amiga, rápidamente la trajo de vuelta a la orilla. Cuando fue al baño nuevamente, descubrió que habían crecido escamas de pez en su cintura. Sus piernas se habían vuelto completamente negras. Daisy, ahora adormecida, usó pinzas para sacar las escamas 1x1. Finalmente, vendó las heridas con gasa Justo entonces apareció su amiga.

I quickly reached down and grabbed it, pulling up a small fish with my bare hands. While the fish wasn't paying attention, I swiftly bit off its head. I was worried she wouldn't be used to it, so I thoughtfully sprinkled some sea salt on it. Once prepared, I handed the fish to her, but she looked at it with disgust, tentatively sniffing it. The strong, fishy smell almost made her gag. I told her to bring it to me. Without hesitation, she threw the fish back into the sea. I was stunned by this. It was the only thing we had found to eat in three days of drifting. She knew she was in the wrong, but still acted all high and mighty, refusing to listen to me. Just as we were at odds, a ship appeared in the distance. She was overjoyed, immediately trying to fire the distress flare, but she didn't have the strength and couldn't pull the trigger. As the ship started to drift away, I told her to hand me the flare gun, but she insisted on doing it herself. In the end, we didn't call for help and only made the situation worse. Even worse, it started pouring rain that night. We were drifting on the sea like leaves in the wind. Luckily, we survived the night and the next day, when the rich woman woke up, she discovered that We had drifted to a small island. She excitedly woke me up and we quickly paddled toward the shore. Once on land, she started criticizing me, blaming everything on me. I couldn't take it anymore and I quit on the spot. She kept yelling at me as I walked away, completely unaware of the consequences she was about to face. She isolated herself, wandering the island for half a day before she finally found some fresh water, almost dying from the sun's heat. Meanwhile, my luck was turning. I quickly found a small hut filled with everything I needed. I even found fresh water with ease. Determined to feast on seafood, I cut open a rubber tire, braided it to strengthen it, and used springs from the bed to make a bow and arrow, easily catching a big lobster. Soon I was enjoying a delicious meal, while she could only watch and envy. Used to a life of luxury, she had no respect for me as the one providing for us. At that point, she pulled out a 1,000, hoping to buy half of my grilled fish. I refused, so she raised it to 10,000. I told her on this deserted island, money was useless. Survival skills were what mattered. She was furious, never imagining that I, a lower class man, would dare treat her this way. Give me some fucking fish, you scumbag! Number one, don't ever insult me again. Number two, I am the boss now. Number three, If you want food, you will have to earn it. Number four. I don't wash my clothes. Can't hit a woman, you fucking lunatic! Don't forget number one. To survive, she had to wash clothes by the creek. I want you to say thank you, master, for the privilege of washing your clothes. Thank you, master, for letting me wash your clothes. Ah! Finally, she earned a bite to eat. In the afternoon, I decided to head back to the hut to rest, but she followed me. I locked the door in her face and she started yelling at me. I would rather fuck a pig than kiss you, monkey boy! She was forced to sleep outside for the night. In the following days, she washed clothes and cooked for me. And whenever she made a mistake, I gave her a good beating. At mealtimes, I made her perform a strip tease. And outside, she was an international star. Here, she was mine. Later, we went fishing together and she willingly washed clothes for me. To please me, she even performed for me. Slowly, she began to enjoy this life, but I knew she didn't belong here. One day, she went to gather firewood and suddenly spotted a cargo ship in the sea. She wanted to shout for help, but then instinctively closed her mouth and quickly hid.

My yearly pay is millions. But I do not deal with trash. I only remove the traces left after violent scenes. They are the biggest crime group in this city. Incidents happen every single day. That is how I became their part time cleaner. But I was not always like this. I used to be a doctor until my son fell seriously ill. I brought him from the Philippines to the US for treatment. To stay close to him, I chose to work as a cleaner. One day after finishing my job, I stumbled upon them taking a life. I froze in the corner holding my breath, praying they would leave. At that moment, my husband called. I hung up fast, but it was too late. They dragged me to their leader. I fell to my knees begging for mercy. His cold stare cut straight through me. To survive, I told him I could handle their scenes. If you wait, the blood will seep in the cement. It needs to be broken down. Surgeon peroxide is best. What is he? A specialist. I can help you make this disappear. Leaching boiling water will do it. Cold War, it says sustain. I put on gloves. I poured chemical. I wiped the stains again and again until not a trace was left. Watching me work, the leader grew interested. I explained I came only for my son's treatment. When it is done, I will return to the Philippines. He said nothing, then told his men to take me home. At home, fear consumed me. I worried they would come after me. I worried my son would lose his chance at care. But looking at him sleeping peacefully, I kept my silence. The next day, I took him to the hospital. I asked about a heart donation. The nurse told me our visa had expired. I had become an illegal immigrant. The hospital could not arrange the surgery. I begged, but the rules were final. I left with my son hopeless. As we walked out, I saw him wave at someone. I turned and saw the same gang member from that night. I approached and asked to see their boss. Soon I was face to face with the leader again. Whatever it is you want from me, stay the hell away from my son. I haven't said a word to anyone. I won't have your men following me around like this. You did a good job. I want you on call. This is your pay for the other night and a burner phone. I'm not someone who can be bought like you and I are both in the country. That's not a rule. We're not afforded the same privileges as everybody else has. When it comes to keeping your son alive, it's not about doing things the right way or the wrong way. But anyway you can, I want you to take this and think on it. My principles. Told me to refuse. But the weight of life pressed harder each second I listened to his offer. I looked at the money in my hand. My heart wavered. I took the cash. I took the phone. I knew I was trapped at home. The hospital called. They told me the heart surgery was approved. Well, I stood in shock. The gang leader had truly stepped in for me.

If we slipped down by accident, the nearby monks would immediately scold us loudly. After that, we had to walk across a narrow passage, and only then would one full attempt count. We repeated this kind of training thousands of times, every single day. One day, someone lost his footing and slid down the slope. I quickly rushed over and pulled him up. But I thought this training was far too simple and sprinted straight up the wall to the other side. Not only that, I even laughed at the abbot, saying he didn't know how to teach his disciple. Seeing my arrogance, the abbot became angry and step forward to teach me a lesson. With just one move, he knocked me to the ground. I could only roll around to dodge. When I tried to fight back, the abbot lifted an iron plate with his leg and bounced me away. Still, I refuse to give up. The senior disciples quickly held me back before things got worse. Even so, my boldness made many people start to admire me. Soon, I became their leader. When we went to the dining hall, I had no appetite for the plain food, so I suggested we go out to eat something better. I LED everyone to the training room, planning to sneak out along the wall. But as soon as we climbed onto the roof, the tile shifted. And everyone fell down. It turned out the abbot already knew about our escape plan. However, I claimed we were just doing extra practice, but the abbot didn't believe a single word. We were punished with hard labor, and anyone caught being lazy would be disciplined on the spot. I was given dishwashing duty, but I didn't take it seriously. Instead, I started showing off by spinning the dishes like acrobatics. The abbot appeared out of nowhere. Before I could react, he tossed a bowl under my leg. When I tried to take it away, he stopped me and ordered me to keep working with the ball stuck between my legs. He even left someone there to watch me. Later, while dumping the dishwater, I noticed the kitchen drain and got another idea to sneak out. I quickly found my fellow monks to discuss it. But since we'd already been caught before, no one dared to go. Suddenly, we heard the abbot's voice. Everyone rushed back to the training room and grabbed benches to practice. But I just sat on the bench. Seeing my attitude, the abbot kicked the bench over with one foot. I grabbed the bench and started fighting back. The abbot immediately picked up a bench too, and we began sparring. Soon he found my weak spot and completely defeated me. That night, I lifted the drain cover and finally escaped from the Shaolin temple.

When were you in there? Yes, ma'am. And just what are you doing? I had no intention of hiding it anymore. I directly pressed the flush button. This made Celia outside the door absolutely furious. Get off my toilet. Oh, you are fired, Miss Jackson. And so in the pouring rain, I was kicked out of my employer's house. However, the matter didn't end there. Emilia not only didn't pay my wages, and she even spread rumors at the White Lady's tea party that I had stolen things. She directly destroyed my career. No one would ever hire me again. This time, I wasn't going to stay silent. The next day, I brought a cake to her house, but she continued to humiliate me while eating the cake. I finally exploded. I revealed the cake's special recipe. What did you say? I said, eat my shit. She immediately retched, although I retaliated against Celia, but I wasn't happy because I might never find suitable work again. However, just as I was despairing, an unexpected interview invitation appeared. To my surprise, my new employer actually ran out barefoot to greet me. His friendly gesture left me confused, but I still dared not let down my guard. As soon as I entered, Celia offered me a Coke. She even quietly confided in me her secret, that she was pregnant. I know it's not A lot to do. Five other mates have already turned me down. Let me at least get you some bus money now. Uh, when you hear me say I don't want to clean this house. Celia was overjoyed and directly ran up to hug me. This is the first time I've hired a maid and I was also very grateful to have gotten this job opportunity. But then Celia confessed, hoping I could keep the employment a secret from her husband. It's not like that, baby. I just wanna think I can do this on my own. And what Mr Johnny gonna do when he come home and find a colored woman in his house? I really need looking at the simple and kind Celia before me. I still agreed. In the following days, my experience was completely different from my time at Celia's house. Celia treated me like a friend for the first time. I felt respected and even ate meals with me. And I meticulously noted her preferred tastes. We also became more and more in sync until this day when Celia accidentally fell and had a miscarriage. I said, get up.

That day, a group of wild cats gathered around my body, sitting silently in a perfect circle like they were performing some ancient ritual. Then suddenly, a stunning royal looking cat appeared. Her name was midnight. The moment midnight arrived, all the other cats bowed their heads, their glowing eyes shimmering with blue. Midnight slowly stepped onto my chest and took a deep breath straight from my mouth. And in the next second, a miracle happened. My eyes flickered open, now glowing bright green just like a cat's. My body began to move. Bit by bit, I came back to life. My vision sharpened. Even distant things looked crystal clear. I stood up stronger, faster, different. I rushed back to the city. Now I could leap to the second floor. In a single jump, I smashed through my window and landed perfectly in my room. The next morning, I fell from a tall cupboard but didn't feel a single ounce of pain. When I looked around, the shattered glass reminded me I had no memory of what had happened last night. That is when I noticed it, a small cat in my apartment. And suddenly it hit me. I'd seen that cat before a few days ago, was sitting on my window ledge. When I tried to save it, my foot slipped and I nearly fell to my death. Luckily, a cop grabbed me. Just in time when I tried to explain what happened, the cat had already vanished. The cop thought I was trying to end my life. I didn't think much of it. I had work to do, so I rushed to the cosmetic factory to collect my design file. There I uncovered something terrifying. The company's new face cream was toxic. If women didn't keep using it, their skin would literally rot away and they'd collapse. But the greedy CEO refused to stop. When I tried to warn others, I got caught. The bodyguards began chasing me through the building. I ran for my life and dove into a sewage tunnel. But they opened the floodgate and I was swept into the river. I should have died that night, but once again, midnight saved me. When I woke up, I saw a bandage around midnight's neck. Written on it was an address. I followed it to an old, creaky house.

A giant truck rolled over me, and I didn't even blink. Three clumsy robbers ran after me. They looked way more nervous than I was. I crawled into the zoo. There, I instantly made a new buddy, a gorilla. The gorilla handed me an apple like we have been friends for years. Then the second robber stuck his hand in the cage. He grabbed my shoelace, thinking he had me. The gorilla's face turned dark. It raised a finger. I suddenly started crying. The robbers panicked even more than me. The third robber showed up with a stick. He poked it through my clothes and lifted me like a hanger. The gorilla jumped up and snatched me back. The robber froze, eyes wide, like he had just seen his mother in law. The leader had to do it himself. He waited until the gorilla and I were asleep, then pulled my leg slowly, but I twitched and the gorilla woke up with a glare. والله عيب the leader ended up hanging on the cage like laundry on a clothesline I followed the gorilla to the backyard we said goodbye like old pals but soon the robbers grabbed me again two police officers showed up they asked about the rich family's baby the leader hid me under his coat hand. Over my tiny mouth the cops and the robbers started chatting well that's a crying shame it's amazing what people will do. For money? Yeah, for 5 million, anything. Oh. The leader tried to look casual while his face was screaming in pain. The police were about to leave. Right before they walked away, people got those barbecues going. That's great, doesn't it? The leader kept a straight face, but his pants were on fire. I crawled away quietly. Freedom never felt so funny when the leader finally noticed.

Quickly lift my shirt to wipe it clean. Outside is pitch black. I shout for help into the darkness. No one responds. I start checking my surroundings. There's another window behind me. I press my face against the glass to look out. Suddenly, two people are working on something outside. I pound on the glass like crazy. The sound finally gets their attention. I desperately gesture for them to get me out. After some back and forth, I learn they're trapped too. My heart sinks completely. The temperature in the chamber is rising. Hot air keeps pouring through the valve. I strip off my outer clothes, down to just a tank top. The gauge shows 50 degrees. Sweat runs down my back. I bang on the glass again, beg them to open the hatch. The man says our chambers have different pressure. Opening it would kill me faster. The only way is to pressurize my side. Make both sides equal. I don't care anymore. I follow his instructions and pinch my nose. Get ready for them to add pressure. During pressurization, my eardrums feel like they're exploding. I grit my teeth and endure it. Finally, both sides balance out. I turn the valve beside me. Can't budge it with all my strength. I grab a wooden stick nearby. Strike it precisely over and over. The valve finally loosens. After unscrewing the valve, I removed the metal plate securing the hatch. With help from the two MEN I finally entered their pressure chamber. Think I'm finally saved. The man says there's a fire outside. All the circuits are fried. Can't send any distress signals. Despair washes over me again. The three of us can only lie down to save energy. I think about my daughter waiting at home. I took immediate action. After the two men fall asleep. I quietly take the only oxygen tank. Confirm it hasn't been used. Gently set it on the ground. Carefully pick up the steel plate. About to lock the hatch. I don't dare make a sound, afraid of waking them. The valve turning still gives me away. The man saw the oxygen tank on the ground, instantly knows what I'm trying to do. He gets angry, has his buddy zip tie me to the corner. I beg desperately, but he doesn't care. Suddenly, there's noise outside. The man rushes to the hatch to check. Several rescue workers appear. The man pounds on the hatch frantically. The rescue team spots us. The man quickly tells his buddy to untie me, afraid the rescue team would notice something off once everything is ready. Suddenly

The cop beside me looked ready to draw his gun. Even the tanks outside the door were aiming at me. Sensing the tension, I quickly changed my order to an Americano. Only then did the barista breathe a sigh of relief and the tank quietly swiveled his barrel away. As an NPC in this game world, I can't even choose my own coffee. In this game that prides itself on freedom, only players wearing sunglasses do as they please, even firing rocket launchers back at pursuing cops. But NPCs are stuck in repetitive, tedious routines. As one of them, I wake up and greet my goldfish first, then pick an outfit from the closet to head to the bank for work. Whenever a player comes in to rob a bank, the guard expertly unbuckles his belt, then lies on the floor with a carefree expression, discussing lunch plans with. But on my way home from work that day, I suddenly spotted a beautiful woman. The moment we passed each other felt like time itself had frozen. Watching a woman's charming back, a flutter I'd never known before began to stir within me. For the first time, I altered my monotonous routine, chased after her to strike up a conversation. But before the words could leave my mouth, thankfully, NPCs can respawn infinitely. Yet something had already shifted when Robert shattered the counterglass again. I suddenly felt this life was meaningless. Lifting my gaze, I saw that dreamlike figure once more. Colleagues urged me to give up, stop fantasizing about the guy in sunglasses. But those words only spurred me on. I wanted to snatch the robber's sunglasses right off. The player in front of the screen was surprised and rushed to manipulate the robber to fight back. Everyone assumed NPCs couldn't resist. Yet in that moment, I craved control over my own fate. After awakening my self awareness, I pulled the trigger. In the middle of an argument, everyone froze in shock. Without looking back, I sprinted out of the bank. Putting on the sunglasses revealed a whole new world. The entire city blanketed in neon lights. Airplanes and cannons scattered everywhere. I found a med kit nearby and instantly healed the wound on my face. I felt refreshed and invigorated, as if I'd truly come alive for the first time. Just then, a player's death dropped a pile of cash. I took it all with a wave of my hand. My bank account suddenly held a year's worth of wages. I withdrew some cash and bought those blue sneakers. But just as I set out to find the girl, the game company detected an anomaly. The footage of me shooting players made the programmers think hackers had infiltrated the system. So they selected their favourite skins, intending to enter the game and teach me a lesson.

I find something stuck in the drain. I reach my hand inside to check. My hand gets cut with a deep. Then black water starts coming out of the drain. It carries a strange, sweet smell. We immediately call an expert to inspect. Turns out there's a well next to the pool. While cleaning, I accidentally opened the underground water channel. The expert says after disinfection, the pool is safe to use. He even says the ground water can be good for the skin. We all feel excited. Didn't expect to get a natural pool for free. A week later, the pool officially opens. But strange things start happening. That evening, my wife goes swimming after work. Our cat runs over and keeps meowing. My wife ignores it and keeps relaxing in the pool while taking a breath. She suddenly sees me standing by the poolside. She's so scared she almost drowns. But I'm not there at all. Then the pool lights start flickering. She quickly gets out of the water. The moment she leaves the pool, the lights go back to normal. She rushes to the bedroom, asks if I went to the pool. I say I've been sleeping the whole time. She looks terrified after hearing that. Late at night, the lights flicker again. The cat walks onto the diving board. A toy boat floats up from the water. It starts moving on its own. The next Day I find the cat's collar, but the cat is nowhere to be found. When I pick up the collar, I noticed my wound is completely gone. I start thinking maybe the pool has some kind of power. That night, I go swimming, too. Later, I visit the hospital for a checkup. The doctor is shocked by how fast I healed. I used to be a pro baseball player. I bought this house to recover from injury. Never thought I'd find a pool like this. One day, my son is diving. He hears a girl's voice underwater. He swims closer to the drain. The girl says she needs help. She wants to find her mother. She also says she found my son's toy. My son reaches in, takes out the toy, let go of me. Ah, help. Then runs to tell my wife because she has also experienced strange things. They both come to talk to me. I think it's just a prank from the neighbor's kids that nearly cost my daughter's life. That night, my wife and I go out. My daughter invites her boyfriend over to the pool. They're having fun and laughing. Then the lights start flashing again. She dives underwater to check and meets the creature down there.

Suddenly, I saw someone in the yard. He was slowly moving toward my bathroom. Fear hit me hard. I quickly got dressed. I reached for my phone to call the police. Then I realized it had died. Panic washed over me. I ran to the balcony on the second floor. I shouted that I had called the police. I tried to scare him off. Then I rushed back inside. I locked the door tight. After checking every exit was secure, I finally picked up my power bank to charge my phone. I didn't notice the man in black had already reached the door. Luckily, the glass had a privacy film. He couldn't see inside. I held my breath. Not a single sound escaped me. He watched for a while. He didn't seem to notice anything unusual. Finally, he moved toward the back door. I realized I forgot to lock it. My heart raced. I rushed and locked it just before he could enter. Watching him peek inside, my heart felt like it was in my throat. I quickly checked the other exits. Auntie moved away. I dared to charge my phone. But I didn't expect him to stay. He kept circling the house looking for an opening. I knew the consequences if he got in would be serious. I tried calling the police again. Several attempts failed. It was like a signal blocker was nearby. I felt completely helpless. I couldn't just Wait. Then I noticed the smoke detector on the ceiling. If I triggered it, the fire department would come. I grabbed a match and lit it against the detector. After some effort, the alarm went off. I thought he would be scared away, but he didn't flinch. He pulled a remote from his bag. One press and the alarm went silent. He immediately tried to force the door. Luckily, it was sturdy. After a few minutes, he left. I planned to sneak out the back, but I ran straight into him. He started hitting the doors and glass. The glass looked like it might break. Then the doorbell rang. My food delivery from an hour ago had arrived. I ran to the second floor balcony. I tried to get the delivery guy to call the police, but he couldn't hear me from that far away. Before I could react, something even more terrifying happened.

I tore through several layers of wallpaper and found a heavy iron door hidden underneath. The shape of the keyhole reminded me of the two iron pieces I had thrown away before. When I put them together, the door actually opened. Behind it was an empty room. But the moment my wife stepped inside, the lights began to flicker. I thought it was just an electrical problem, so I called an electrician. But when he saw the tangled wires and those precise instruments, he couldn't figure out what it was and left in a hurry. That night, I went back to the room again holding an empty wine bottle. I casually wished for another one. The lights went out for a second, and suddenly another bottle appeared on the floor. The next morning, when my wife came in, the room was already filled with all kinds of things. I happily told her while holding the famous painting. But everything was granted by my wishes. She thought I had lost my mind until I told her to wish for a million dollars. The lights went out again and piles of cash appeared on the floor. We started carrying the money out like crazy. We kept making wishes. Paintings covered the walls, diamonds sparkled everywhere. Delicious food and fine wine filled the air. That room could give us anything we wanted. We drowned ourselves in luxury. But the joy didn't last long. Soon it turned into emptiness. We had never been able to have children, and my wife started to have new thoughts. One day, when I came home, I saw her in the room holding a baby. She said she had wished for it. I wanted a child, too, but I couldn't accept that way. I told her to wish the baby away. But when I held him in my arms, ready to make that wish, I realized I couldn't do it either. In the end, we decided to keep him. Even though I knew that child wasn't from this world.

I wanted to time it right and throw it back, but the next day I came back to life again. When I walked out of my house again, no matter how many times I died, I would wake up the next day and do the same things over and over again. First, I would say hello to my goldfish and I would put on the same clothes I wore yesterday. Passing by a shoe store, I saw the sneakers I still couldn't afford. I entered my usual coffee shop. I ordered a cup of coffee without sugar. Then I went to the bank to serve two ladies as usual. After that, I was just waiting for the robbers to appear. Gunshots pierced the sky. The security guard calmly unbuckled his belt, handed over his weapon and lay down on the ground. We even chatted about what to have for afternoon tea. We had long since grown accustomed to all of this because we weren't real people. We were just NPCs in the game free city. Our sole purpose was to help players complete their missions. Those wearing sunglasses were real players. They could do as they pleased. We who weren't wearing sunglasses could only follow the script. I was one of them. But that day, the pattern was broken. I saw a girl in leather pants humming a tune. My heart skipped a beat. He couldn't Look away. The security guard rushed over and told me she was wearing sunglasses so we couldn't bother her. But I didn't care. I left my designated route and chased after her, hoping to get her contact information. Hey, but luckily I was just an NPC. The next day I started over as if nothing had happened. But when I arrived at the coffee shop, I suddenly wanted to add sugar to my coffee. The waitress froze. She didn't even know what to do. Police and customers were staring at me. Even the large tank outside was pointing directly at me. I'm joking. Oh, keep it on your toes. I'm kidding. Oh, you think I deprived myself of your baristic artist? Then everything returned to normal. At the bank, the robbers appeared on time as usual. I lay down skillfully, but when I looked up, I saw her again. The security guard warned me that she was wearing sunglasses and that we could never be together. That's when I realized if I also wore sunglasses, everything would change. So I slowly approached the robber to borrow his sunglasses, but ended up getting beaten up. As the leather clad girl was about to walk away, I immediately stood up to fight back. In the struggle, I accidentally knocked down the player. I snatched the sunglasses and rushed out. The moment I put on the sunglasses, my world completely changed. The city looked entirely different. The streets were filled with tanks and Fighter jets, then a medical kid appeared beside me. I reached out and touched it and all my wounds vanished instantly. That feeling was absolutely amazing.

She threw scalding hot coffee right on my arm. I was shaking with rage, but didn't dare say a word. Because she was Thailand's high and mighty royal consort, and she had chartered this entire plane for herself. The more I thought about it, the more humiliated I felt. For revenge, I took off my high heel, stirred that coffee with my shoe heel, and served it back to her. She still wouldn't let it go. She demanded I take off my sapphire ring. Facing her dominance, I could only obey. I never expected she just tossed the ring on the floor, then crushed it under her foot. She coldly said she was hungry, told me to prepare lunch, said she'd return it after eating. I brought her the lunch, but she deliberately complained. Said she didn't want it. She wanted my crew meal instead. I knew she was allergic to seafood, so I picked out all the seafood, only heated up the noodles and served them. Never expected. After just a few bites, she started coughing violently. I suggested she go wash up. When she came back, red rashes covered her entire face. At first, I didn't realize how serious this was until the next day. On the return flight, the TV broadcast the news. The consort had unexpectedly passed away last night. Since she was royalty, her body had to be transported back home. And the person transporting her body, Was me. I thought I just had to complete the task, get some sleep, and it would be over. But I never imagined. Mid flight, the plane hit strong turbulence. The consort's body suddenly moved. I was too scared to breathe. Even worse, she fell straight from her seat, falling toward me. I frantically unbuckled my seatbelt, hid in the corner, and minutes later, I finally forced myself to approach, made myself drag her back to the seat, even tied her down with rope. Terrified she'd fall again, I thought the nightmare was over, but I was wrong. The plane shook again. I suddenly woke up. It was just a dream, but I was too scared to sleep anymore. Just as I got up for water, I noticed in the cabin, a figure appeared. I stepped closer. The consort tied to the seat was gone. The next second, vomiting sounds came from the bathroom. I pushed open the door. Nobody was inside. While I was confused, the light suddenly went out. The door locked from outside. Fear made me pound on the door desperately, but the door wouldn't open. Suddenly, a dark shadow appeared behind me. I screamed and beat on the door with all my strength. Barely managed to escape, but right after I got out, a service cart came crashing at me. The shadow appeared again in the corridor. Terrified, I grabbed a fire axe, shouted for the captain to open the door, but he thought I was Crazy refused to help me. In desperation, I smashed at the glass. The captain had no choice. He finally opened the cockpit door, tied me to a seat. Right across from me was the consort's body. At that moment, I completely broke down. Could only beg her to spare my life. But she suddenly started coughing violently. My hands were tied tight. I couldn't move at all. When the plane landed, the staff came in. They only found me with hands pressed together, kneeling at the consort's feet, mysteriously dead.

Even when I'm working out, A few drops leak out. I hold it in the rest of the time. I keep myself busy inside the prison, working hard. And finally, on this day, lunch comes with soybeans. I swallow them all in one gulp. When the warden walks in for inspection, I fake a choke, then spit the soybeans back out. One shot! Get this damn convict away from me! Get him firmer! Come on! The doctor takes one look at me and quickly makes a diagnosis. One injection would cure it. But I've drunk so much water that I can't hold it anymore. Doctor hands me a bedpan. I laugh and tell him, this thing is way too small. I need 10 of them just to get through. That's when another inmate steps in and offers to take me to the toilet. So we walk over. What nobody knows is that inside this tiny cubicle, there's a hidden passage. I climb up on the toilet, tell the inmate to stand guard at the door, and I pull out a tool I hit earlier. Done taping off, I unlock the wife. Once I'm inside, I shut it back down, making it look like nothing ever happened. The passage leads straight to the tool room. We take out a wooden plank, slide it underneath the truck. The moment the truck rolls out, we slip into The hollow space inside the plank. When the vehicle passes through the checkpoint, the scanners don't pick up the thing. Then, at a gas station stop, we crawl out, ditch the plank, and bolt toward our friend's car. Just like that, we make it out of prison alive. But inside the car, the woman driving keeps stealing glances at me.

Anna, however, didn't notice anything amiss with Jack. She quickly found a book, but the passages in it describing intimate relations between men and women were like nothing either of them had ever seen. Five years earlier, their father had died in a car accident. Their mother had taken them to live with their grandmother. But in hopes of marrying their mother off to a wealthy family, the grandmother had locked all four of her grandchildren in the attic. They've been trapped there for five years. Jack and Anna were now entering puberty, yet they still shared the same room. Anna even admired her own figure right in front of Jack, making him burn with a feverish heat. But due to his lack of knowledge, Jack had no idea why he felt that way. Anna, oblivious to his state, danced in front of him as she always did, stoking the fire in his body until it felt like it might consume him. Anna then playfully snatched Jack's paintbrush. In his rush to get it back, he pushed her to the floor. Staring at Anna's beauty, Jack froze just as he felt an urge to do something but didn't know what. Their grandmother walked in, furious at what she thought she'd caught Jack doing.

Just as I was about to greet it, the creature turned around and glanced at me, then suddenly teleported over and snapped the woman's neck. Seeing my girlfriend lose her life, I furiously demanded to know why. But the creature didn't answer me. It teleported again and disappeared from before my eyes. At that moment, a teammate notified me to retreat immediately. A female teammate had just been attacked and killed by this bizarre creature as well. I painfully brought my girlfriend's body back to the spacecraft and questioned the captain about what that creature actually was. Our mission was only to come to Mars to eliminate cockroaches. That thing didn't look like a cockroach at all. The captain speculated that the cockroaches must have been exposed to cosmic radiation and mutated into terrifying cockroach men. Just then, a loud crash came from outside. The cockroach men had quietly followed us here. A mercenary immediately stepped forward, absolutely confident in himself. As a cockroach man kept approaching, he injected a cellular activity agent into his body. His DNA immediately recombined and the bombardier beetle genes within him awakened. He completed his transformation in an instant. After the enhancement, his strength greatly increased. He launched an attack on the cockroach man, then extended his right hand and sprayed scorching hot flames from his palm. We thought the battle was over, but when the flames dissipated, we were shocked to discover that the cockroach man Hadn't suffered any damage. In the harsh environment of Mars, the cockroach man had already evolved a powerful physical body. Just as the bombardier beetle prepared to attack again, the cockroach man used teleportation and ended the bombardier beetle's life. Everyone was terrified, but the next second, the cockroach man teleported onto the spacecraft, kept ramming the glass with his head, trying to enter the spacecraft's interior. The female teammate kept backing away in fright, but the vice captain comforted everyone not to panic, saying the glass had been specially reinforced. However, before he could finish speaking, the cockroach man shattered the glass with one strike and looked fiercely at everyone. Seeing this, the captain immediately injected the cellular activity agent into his body and transformed into a bullet ant. With one punch, he pierced through the cockroach man's body. But before they could celebrate, the shrill alarm sounded again. The radar had detected countless cockroach men rapidly approaching from outside. The one just now had been a cockroach man scout. Facing such numbers, we had no chance of survival. At this time, the spacecraft's launch system also malfunctioned, making it impossible to take off. The captain decided to stay behind to deal with the cockroach army, while the others headed to the nearby ship. Now two to escape. Soon everyone got into the space vehicle. A teammate injected the cellular activity agent into his body and instantly transformed into a toad man. The moment the hatch opened, outside was Already swarming with countless cockroach men, the toadman immediately sprayed flames from his mouth. The enormous thrust was like a rocket launch, completely ignoring the swarms of cockroach men and instantly propelling the space vehicle out. It turned out the toadman was actually a Rove Beetle. The gas sprayed from its tail could enable rapid escape when encountering danger. With speeds reaching 5,000 km per hour, they quickly left the cockroach army behind. Before everyone could celebrate, a new crisis emerged. A massive black tidal wave suddenly appeared ahead, rapidly approaching us. As the camera gradually zoomed in, we were shocked to discover that this was actually a tsunami composed of countless cockroach men.

My female boss has a name similar to mine, so she accidentally took my package. I was terrified she'd open it and think I was a pervert, so I quickly explained it was for my dog. But when she caught a glimpse of the delicate collar in my hand, her expression clearly showed she didn't believe it was for a pet. Since we weren't that close, she didn't ask further questions. Maybe to make up for taking my package, she offered to throw away the shipping box for me. Watching her walk away with that box sent another wave of panic through me. I rushed over to stop her, but it was too late. In the commotion, the box fell to the floor and a card slipped out. When she saw the card, any remaining doubt vanished. She was now completely convinced this collar had nothing to do with a pet. After that embarrassing incident, I couldn't look my boss in the eye. I was afraid she'd tell others my secret or label me a creep. The anxiety tormented me for days, until I finally cracked and posted about it on social media. My post quickly went viral. One trending comment stood out. If your boss hasn't exposed your secret yet, maybe she's into the same things. That comment struck a chord. It made me recall the strange looks she'd been giving me lately. Suddenly, I Felt a surge of hope. Meanwhile, my boss found herself pausing in front of an adult store a few days later. She hadn't been able to stop thinking about me either. Encouraged by the responses online, I hesitated, but finally decided to act. I asked her to meet me at a quiet spot in the countryside. There I confessed everything. My kinks, my desires. I even boldly asked her to be my dominant, promising my complete obedience. She was at a loss for words, though she politely declined. On the surface, I could tell she was curious. After going home, she started searching online. The more she Learned, the more interested she became. But since we were in a boss employee relationship, she still didn't know how to handle the situation. Her hesitation and avoidance felt like disgust and rejection to me. After a company dinner one evening, completely lost it. I broke down sobbing in the parking lot. When my boss saw me, she told me she didn't mind my kinks at all. She just didn't know how to deal with it. Her understanding hit me hard. Without even wiping my tears, I asked her out again, this time with hope shining in my eyes. Surprisingly, she tentatively agreed. Gradually adapting to her new role, she did thorough research and even drew up a contract with me. We agreed to engage in play at least once a week. Though it was awkward at first, my cooperation helped her begin. To enjoy our dynamic. At work, we acted like strangers, but in private, we grew close. On her birthday, I gave her a beautiful pair of red high heels. She absolutely loved them. Just as our relationship was deepening, something unexpected happened.

The game begins. I charge forward at full speed, nimbly dodging the defender in front of me and slipping past the second one. I am about to tackle their running back when another defender blindsides me. My head spins. All I can hear is the opponent's laughter and my coach is furious, shouting, the left, you got outside. Contain outside. On the next play, my teammate reminds me to cover the backside, which leaves me confused. By the time I realize what's happening, their player has made it through the outside for a touchdown. The coaches are seriously unhappy with my performance. Their trash talk and questioning voices hit me hard. Well, why did you get him, son? You just cost us 6 points. I feel defeated, but I am not about to give up. Every morning when I wake up, I run suicide drills to build my endurance and speed. During team scrimmages, I work on reading my opponent's intentions. This time, I successfully intercept their pass. I sprint toward their line and spot my opportunity, firing the ball to a teammate who takes it in for a score. Seeing my improvement, coach gives me props. Soon, the national championship begins. No. 4 kicks off. The football arcs through the air. When their returner catches it, I take off toward him. After juicing past one defender, I bring him down hard. The crowd erupts. The next play comes quickly. During the setup I am watching the No. 23. When he makes his move, I read his intention. Take me more, take me more, take me more. My teammate catches my signal and the formation adjusts. The whistle blows. Sure enough, their No. 23 breaks from his original route. I explode toward him and drive him into the ground. This time, even the coaching guys on the bench are going absolutely wild. That's how you do it. You understand me? That's how you come down here. Congratulations. You just did your job.

I grabbed the tripod lying in the middle. When I collapsed, the creature crept closer in a strange posture. But oddly, it didn't hurt me. It simply lowered itself, mimicking my movements. Not long after, I came to. As soon as I opened my eyes, the creature was right in front of me. Terrified, I bolted for the door. But the second I pulled it open, the creature lunged, slamming me hard against it. I fought with everything I had, but the more I struggled, the tighter it pressed me down, until I couldn't breathe. At last I blacked out again. When I opened my eyes the second time, a chilling thought struck me. This wasn't some ordinary hunt. The creature was copying me every move, even the rhythm of my breathing. This time I forced myself to stay calm. A reckless idea flashed through my mind. I walked to the wall, pulled out a white phosphorus grenade, and carefully handed it to the creature. As expected, took it. I gripped its hand, forcing it to clutch the grenade tight. The moment my skin touched its, its body began to change. It was becoming me. Swallowing my fear, I pulled the pin.

But after examining me for half an hour, the doctor told me I didn't need any treatment. He said it would get better if I just stayed away from my husband for a while. I tried to explain that I've been divorced for years and I hadn't dated anyone since then. But the doctor didn't believe me. He thought I was lying. No matter how much I tried to explain, the doctor stuck to his diagnosis. The next day, I came back.

After making some quick notes about my case, he just turned and walked away. But guess what? I was back again on the third day. This time my neck was hurting, and after checking me out, the doctor said it was a hickey. I told him I'd already looked it up online, and I was sure it was an early sign of cancer. The doctor was getting frustrated. He still thought I was making things up. I kept telling the doctor I didn't have a husband and I hadn't had a boyfriend in ages. Seeing how insistent I was. He pulled out a couple strands of my hair, planning to run some kind of psychological test, just see if maybe I'd gotten a boyfriend without being aware of it. But I stood my ground. The doctor went ahead and tested my hair, but the results came back totally normal. He thought I might have split personality disorder, so he asked me how I've been sleeping. I told him I slept just fine, except I always woke up feeling exhausted and worn out. And my ex husband, who lives downstairs, he'd been calling me lately, wanting to get back together after hearing all this. But the doctor seemed to have figured something out. He had me spend the night in the hospital sleep lab the next day, looking at my brain waves. He noticed they became extremely active after midnight. That's a classic sign of sleepwalking. The truth finally came out. Turns out I've been sleepwalking to my ex husband's place every night, which explained the pregnancy and the hickey. The doctor suggested I just go home and remarry the guy, joking that I couldn't even keep my ex out of my dreams. Then he prescribed me some medication to help treat my sleepwalking problem.

Se subió para obtenerla y descubrió que era el teléfono del difunto esposo. Dándose cuenta de que el teléfono contiene secretos, conectó el cargador. En ese momento, el oficial de policía a cargo del caso de su esposo vino a su casa. El oficial preguntó si había visto ese teléfono. Antes de que pudiera responder, la pantalla del teléfono se proyectó en el televisor, reproduciendo metraje de la escena del crimen. El asesino era el mismo oficial de policía parado frente a ella. Lisa rápidamente apagó la pantalla y calmadamente dijo que no había visto el teléfono. Después de que el oficial se fue, inmediatamente llamó al hermano de su esposo. Jack le dijo directamente que el teléfono había sido encontrado y que podía probar que la oficial de policía era la asesina. No sabía. Su conversación estaba siendo monitoreada por esa oficial de policía. Cuando se encontraron, jack rápidamente tomó el teléfono. Mientras tanto, la oficial de policía lo rastreó a través de la conversación monitoreada y comenzó a perseguirlos. Jack corrió a un centro comercial. La oficial de policía disparó y lo golpeó. Jack fue herido y la oficial confiscó el teléfono. La evidencia se había ido esa noche. Jack y lisa se desplomaron en el sofá. No sabían qué hacer. A continuación. Jack, que trabajaba como instalador eléctrico, de repente recordó que los televisores guardan automáticamente videos reproducidos. Claro, encontraron la evidencia en el televisor de lisa. Recogieron el televisor y se dirigieron a la comisaría de policía, planeando entregar la evidencia al abogado. Pero antes de subir, lisa vio al abogado junto con esa oficial de policía. Cubrió que estaban trabajando juntos. Esto le dio a jack una mejor idea. Caminó hacia la sala de control de la comisaría y conectó el televisor al sistema de transmisión pública en un instante.

When I was 7, a man with glasses came to my door. He said my dad died on a mission. He didn't say how. He just gave my mom a badge. With it, they promised to help us no matter how hard it was. Just tell the operator, Oxford's not rogues and then I'll notice you. But my mom just wanted her husband back, so the man gave the badge to me. 10 years later, my mom was with a thug and I looked like one, too. He beat me. He insulted my mom. He sent his crew after me. One day to get back at him, I stole his sports car. I drifted through the streets gunning the engine. Then the cops caught me. It was my first time in jail. I realised I was in big trouble. Then I remembered the man and the badge. I always kept it with me. So I tried calling the number on the back and I said the code, Oxford's not brown. Minutes later, I was out and there he was waiting at the door. That's when I found out the truth. My dad died saving him and he was disappointed in me. I wanted to argue, but before I could, my dad's men found me. They were here to make me pay. The man with glasses walked to the door. Manners make it. What happened next? Blew my mind. He moved fast. He hit hard. In just seconds, he took down several guys. His umbrella was his weapon. It had hidden wires with high voltage. One thug pulled a gun. He calmly opened the umbrella. It was bulletproof. I was stunned and he looked so graceful. He took me to a tailor shop and then he told me everything. My dad was a royal agent and now he wanted me to join them. I had no better choice, so I agreed. He placed his hand on a mirror. Then the ground started to drop. I don't know how many floors, but when I looked up, I saw a train. In just a few seconds, it crossed the city and went underground to a castle. I was shocked by the massive military factory. The other eight candidates were already there. Only one of us would become a royal agent. Each bed had a body bag. We had to write our names and the personal info of our loved ones. This meant the test to become a royal agent was deadly serious. But no one seemed to care because except for me, they all came from elite universities. They looked at me with disdain. The first test came soon. We had barely fallen asleep when the room started to flood. Everyone woke up in a panic. It looked like we were about to drown. Someone suggested using the shower pipe and toilet to breathe, so everyone rushed for The shower head. But I just wanted to open that door. Otherwise, none of us would last much longer. But the pressure was too strong. I didn't hesitate. I swam to the mirror on the opposite side. I knew it had to be a two way mirror. I was right. A few punches and the mirror shattered. I saved everyone. Just as the examiner praised me, he delivered some bad news. One female candidate died in the test. That's when everyone realised this was real. But we had to move on to the next test. We had to jump from thousands of meters up and land at a target. Everyone thought it would be easy, but when we jumped out of the plane, the examiner announced one of our backpacks didn't have a parachute. And guess who's the unlucky one?

Great. What is the next step? I want grandchildren. Whoever gets pregnant from my son 1st will become his wife. They thought I was tall and handsome, but in reality, I was sitting in a wheelchair because I'm disabled. My mother told me to go back to my room and wait. And the girls would come in one by one. Who's going to be first? Uh, me. As long as he's rich, I don't care about a wheelchair. The first girl came in and directly stated her intentions. Let's make you a baby. Just as she approached me, I rejected her. Not for me. For us. Okay. I'm ready to change our baby's diapers. Breath deep. Do you really want to talk about this now? I just want you to understand the responsibility involved. Let's think about it a bit later, okay? Get out of my room. I drove her out of the room. She wasn't a responsible girl. The second girl changed into sexy clothes and danced in front of me. But she ignored the fact that I was disabled. I regretfully told her that I had lost my ability to have children. Why then your mother demanding all this? She just doesn't know that I can't give her a grandchild. Um, maybe I can review your. After all. Listen, maybe better go. And then I rejected her too. But the Third girl seemed different, as if she had some hidden pain. My son doesn't like to wait. She unwillingly walked in. After entering, she closed the curtains and walked toward me. I was looking forward to seeing what kind of surprise she might bring. When she got closer to me, I could tell she wasn't willing at all. I'm sorry. Sorry, I can't. Why did you come to my mother's competition then? I didn't have a choice. I was threatened with deportation. Getting married is the only way to can enter documents. But. But I'm not ready to do all this. I admire you for staying true to your principles. Don't worry, I won't force you to do anything. You can go. She held on to her moral boundaries, and that made me deeply interested in her. Nine months later, the first two girls were both pregnant, but only the third girl wasn't. I see some of you managed to get pregnant. But I don't like lies. Ah, leave. My mother drove her away. My belly is real. You can touch it. I believe that you're carrying a beautiful baby. But not my son's. She kept pretending to be clueless, but my mother showed the evidence. In the end, she and the bodyguard were both kicked out. Just as the third girl was about to leave, I stopped her. The truth is, my mother always knew that I couldn't have children. And you are the only one who didn't try. To deceive us.

Then I secretly hide the syringe under the car seat. With the help of the drugs, I have won 8 world championships in a row. I thought everything was flawless. So, but right after the competition ended, the coach received a call from the organizers saying they would conduct a surprise test. Immediately hearing that news, I completely panicked. To save my career, I quickly dropped to the floor and started doing push UPS, trying to speed up my blood circulation through intense exercise. Meanwhile, the coach rushed out of the room and pressed every button in the elevator to buy time. But I was still hesitating with the syringe in my hand. Er luckily with the coach help, I finally managed to inject it. With time running dangerously short, we had to race against every second. When the elevator reached the 8th floor, uh, the coach told me to, uh, pedal the bike with full force to boost my metabolism while he injected salad into my body as fast as he could. Then suddenly there was a knock at the door. The coach quickly pushed me into the bathroom and told me to use the shower as cover to inject the remaining saline into my body. Only by diluting the drug concentration in my blood did I pass this inspection. The organizers were getting more and more impatient outside, so I pretended everything was normal and walked out of The bathroom. Thankfully, we had prepared countermeasures beforehand and just like that, I passed the blood test smoothly. To avoid similar emergencies in the future, the coach even hired a private doctor who could not only help me avoid detection better, but also adjust my drug dosage to make sure I won every race. The coach even increased the amount of banned substances. With the boost from the drugs, I was like a wild horse on the track. My speed was explosive and my form was perfect. I quickly became the centre of attention and in the end, I lived up to expectations and won again. But during the post race urine test, while the other athletes provided their samples under supervision, I was singled out to give a blood sample. My heart almost jumped out of my chest. But under the organizers strict monitoring, I had no choice but to cooperate. When I returned home, my family was celebrating my victory. But deep down I knew if the blood test fail, I would be finished. The coach told me not to worry. He said he already had a plan to make the test results match my current blood levels. He had me stay inside a special tent to simulate high altitude conditions. After just one hour, my red blood cell count would return to normal. This method of evading detection cost $500,000. But to protect my career, I had no choice but to accept. And just like that, I Escaped the crisis once again.

When I woke up from the coma, I was still in the secret room, but this time the door wasn't closed. I hurriedly went out and didn't expect that there was a lot of water and food here. But at this time, I suddenly found a man in the corner. Before I could react, the old man had come over, facing my questions. He also told the truth. The original earth was attacked by aliens. The air was no longer suitable for human survival, so he built this bunker to hide. The man was someone he picked up from outside and I was in a coma due to a car accident and was found by him and brought back. The old man called us to visit the bunker's living room. The facilities here were more complete, not only with various DVDs and books, but even household appliances were available. It was clear that the old man had made enough preparations for the end of the world. But my heart was still skeptical. The old man saw my doubts, so he took me to the entrance of the bunker. The two locked iron doors completely isolated us from the outside world. The old man first opened the first iron door to let me go out. Through the window, I found that there was silence outside. But just then I suddenly saw the old man's car. And this car I was very familiar. With it was the pickup truck that caused my accident. Having doubts, I could no longer trust the old man.

My only company was comic books and that tiny room. Because of my height, I often broke the walls without meaning to. Dad spent every day fixing them. They knew I was only 5 and still growing. But if things went on like this, the house wouldn't last long. When I turned 16, I was over 13 feet tall. I never went to school. I never truly stepped outside. Until one day, I broke the door just by standing up. To stop the house from collapsing, my parents built me a new one in the backyard. It was twice as tall as a normal house. Even the furniture was made to fit my size. I finally didn't have to sleep on that tiny bed. For the first time, I felt like I had space to breathe. But I still wanted to go out. When I told my parents, they refused right away. They said the world wasn't mine until I could protect myself. Because to everyone else, I was a monster. I didn't understand. But I Had no choice.

I tried to explain that I've been divorced for years and I hadn't dated anyone since then. But the doctor didn't believe me. He thought I was lying. No matter how much I tried to explain, the doctor stuck to his diagnosis. The next day, I came back. This time my stomach was hurting, and after doing an ultrasound, the doctor told me I'd had a miscarriage. Now I was really pissed off. I don't even have a husband. But the doctor still wouldn't believe I was single. He couldn't wrap his head around it because the test results don't lie. After making some quick notes about my case, he just turned and walked away. But guess what? I was back again on the third day. This time my neck was hurting, and after checking me out, the doctor said it was a hickey. I told him I'd already looked it up online, and I was sure it was an early sign of cancer. The doctor was getting frustrated. He still thought I was making things up. I kept telling the doctor I didn't have a husband and I hadn't had a boyfriend in ages. Seeing how insistent I was. He pulled out a couple strands of my hair, planning to run some kind of psychological test to see if maybe I'd gotten a boyfriend without being aware of it. But I stood my ground. The doctor went ahead and tested my hair, but the results came back totally normal. He thought I might have split personality disorder, so he asked me how I've been sleeping. I told him I slept just fine, except I always woke up feeling exhausted and worn out. And my ex husband, who lives downstairs, he'd been calling me lately, wanting to get back together after hearing all this. But the doctor seemed to have figured something out. He had me spend the night in the hospital sleep lab the next day looking at my brain waves. He noticed they became extremely active after midnight. That's a classic sign of sleepwalking. The truth finally came out. Turns out I've been sleepwalking to my ex husband's place every night, which explained the pregnancy and the hickey. The doctor suggested I just go home and remarry the guy, joking that I couldn't even keep my ex out of my dreams. Then he prescribed me some medication to help treat my sleepwalking problem.

When I was full, I'd sneak into the restroom and switch places with my sister. Then she'd keep eating. We looked so identical that even our own parents often couldn't tell us apart. So my sister and I would constantly swap identities to take advantage of different situations. This even extended to our studies. Whichever one of us had better grades would take the exams for the other. We never gave away even the slightest hint about our secret. However, one day, because of our parents'divorce, my sister and I were forced to separate and live different lives. Twenty years flew by. In the blink of an eye, my sister became a successful businesswoman and married a man who seemed to love her with all his heart. One day, when my sister was seven months pregnant and on her way to the hospital for a prenatal checkup, her husband suddenly claimed the car had broken down. Then he and my sister's best friend got out of the car to check on the problem. But the moment they got out, they revealed their true intentions to her. The man locked all the car doors. Before my sister could understand what was happening, the two of them pushed the car into the river. Despite my sister's desperate please, her husband remained unmoved. As the car slowly sank into the water, my sister tragically lost her life. The next day, when her body was pulled from the water, her husband and her best friend sobbed uncontrollably in front of the public. When reporters interviewed them, the husband explained that his wife had been under tremendous work pressure and had developed depression and ultimately made the decision to leave this world. When everyone saw his obvious grief, they all believed his story. But right then I suddenly appeared.

Still half asleep, she climbed into the driver's seat. Oh, god, the list. You forgot the list. She drove off down the road. Pedestrians kept staring at her car. Oh, my god. Wow. That level of violence is totally acceptable to me. A bloody man was scrawled across the roof. But it was Halloween. Everyone assumed it was just an elaborate prank. Until someone noticed the man's legs were twitching. They frantically called for help. Are you sure it wasn't a Halloween decoration? That's what we thought it was at first, but it moved. The dispatcher just laughed after hearing the description. Another Halloween prank call. Climb the car and get back to me. The woman pulled into a gas station. Firefighter Buck happened to be passing by. He froze when he saw the man on the roof. This wasn't a costume. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Lady! Lady! Damn! Come on! Buck immediately went after her. He pulled her car over. You are a horrible driver. You are right in my way. Ma'am, I'm. I'm a firefighter. Really? Well, your costume sucks. Okay, uh, can I just take a look at your, um. Did you hurt yourself? After checking Buck discovered the woman suffered from severe post concussion syndrome. She had no clue what was going on. The man on the roof was still alive. Hope is on its way. The rescue team arrived on scene. They insisted on giving buck a complete checkup. Oh, well, no, it's. It's not mine. Um, I have another shirt in my. Maybe you should know I'm on blood thinners.

But when he saw me, his face was filled with shock. Q, do you have another wife? Yes, I'm his wife. I stared in disbelief at the pregnant woman beside him, while Cruz looked completely indifferent. Furious, I slapped him hard across the face. I thought, your best way. It turned out Cruz thought I had died in battle, so he married someone else. But I just couldn't accept that reality. Heartbroken, I turned and walked away, ignoring his new wife's protests. Cruz ran after me. Jane, I didn't know. So is this supposed to make me feel better? He tried to explain, but I wouldn't let him. I punched him again in anger. To prove he never stopped loving me, Cruz took out the keepsake from our past. I could tell it was real. Thinking about him marrying someone else, I hit the steering wheel in frustration. When I asked why he got married, he said he thought it would help him forget me. Did it help? It didn't. I still love you. Everything went. After a moment of silence, he started talking about our old dream again. Having two daughters, taking them out for milkshakes. I said quietly that those days were gone. I stood up to leave, but Cruz followed, unwilling to let go. He wanted one last hug, and just as we embraced, his wife saw us. He slammed the Plate in anger and the stress caused her contractions to start. Hearing her scream, Cruz ran back inside immediately. We helped her into the car, getting ready to drive to the hospital, but as soon as she sat down, her water broke. I had medical training, so I had no choice but to deliver the baby myself. Half an hour later, Cruz's daughter was born safely. I handed the baby into his arms, then quietly turned around and walked away.

The boat drifted further and further away and I shouted loudly, but my daughter didn't hear me with her headphones on. My husband turned around and realized something was wrong. He headed for the bow and saw me. He turned on full power and headed toward me. And after getting close to me, he turned around, stood up on the guard rail and jumped off. He swam towards me, turn me around and secured my hands to his chest, face up, slowly approaching the boat. We came to the stern of the boat. He rescued me. I recovered from the shock as the family calmed me down. My husband proposed a return trip, but I insisted on spending our son's birthday at sea with the blessings of the whole family. He blew out the candles and finally we took a group photo together. Suddenly, our son realized something was wrong. He turned to the outside of the boat, spotting schools of whales. One whale hit the bottom of the boat and my husband realized something was wrong. He came inside the ship and tried to start the engine but failed. He came outside the cabin and saw a meteor gliding through the sky. As everyone watched, the meteor crashed into the ocean, he turned around and climbed to the top of the ship. He found another shooting Star falling, so he turned the horsepower up to maximum. The ship began to accelerate when suddenly another meteor slipped close by. He protected our family underneath him. When he looked up, he realized it was an artificial satellite. My husband realized something was wrong. He looked down and saw white smoke coming out. Opening the hood, he realized the engine had failed badly. We went inside the cabin and put on our life jackets. Suddenly, the sea kicked up a big wave and we lost our balance, clung to the corner to fix our bodies and were temporarily safe. When we woke up again, he found a big hole broken in the cabin, but no seawater had leaked in. He opened the door to the deck and found fish everywhere in MUD. We went to the bow and looked around. And although the ship was broken, we were out of danger of being buried at sea. But now the sea was gone.

Thinking it was a system error, I randomly entered an amount and the ATM started spitting out cash. Money scattered all over the ground. I could only keep apologizing while quickly stuffing the bills into my pockets, then fled the scene feeling guilty. Back in my rental apartment, the landlord rushed up to me asking if I'd recently struck it rich because he'd received many packages today with only my name on them. It all seemed very mysterious. I quickly blocked him from entering, gave him the overdue rent and hurried to get rid of him. But when I turned on the lights, I was shocked, speechless by the packages filling the entire room. Had Lady Luck really smiled on me? Curious, I opened one box to find high powered ultra clear binoculars, military pistols, sniper rifles, armour piercing bullets and in another box, several passports from different countries, all bearing my name. Just then, the phone rang. A strange voice warned me, the FBI will arrive at your apartment in 30 seconds. You must flee the premises. After listening, I quickly went to the window but didn't see anyone suspicious. I demanded to know who the caller was. A stranger told me that with all this illegal equipment in my room, if I got caught, treason charges would definitely stick. Before I could make up my mind, suddenly a flash. Grenade was thrown in. FBI, FBI, FBI! Get on the ground. Get on the ground. No, I didn't do anything. Get out. That's how I ended up at the Counter Terrorism Centre. The director wanted me to explain the source of the illegal weapons and the large sum of money in my account. I was speechless because I truly knew nothing. Change the subject to my twin brother, Jesse. Jesse had a genius level IQ, graduated from the Air Force Academy and worked in the Air Force's classified department. But during a secret mission, he suddenly disappeared. They suspected Jesse had joined a foreign terrorist organisation and the weapons shipped back from overseas were evidence. I said we hadn't been in contact for over three years and I didn't believe my brother would betray our country. The director was extremely frustrated. The city had been experiencing frequent terrorist attacks and today they'd finally found a lead. He was determined to get some clues from me, but he didn't know that the mysterious person had been secretly monitoring everything and had forged an official letter from the nation's highest judicial department authorizing me to contact my lawyer. Soon an agent came in and politely helped me change rooms. However, when I tried to call my father for answers, the mysterious person's voice came through the phone again. What? What the hell are you talking about? 4 seconds, Jerry. No, this is bullshit. I don't. Get down now. Two seconds. I was terrified. Someone Had actually dared to attack FBI headquarters. Had my brother really joined a terrorist organization? Just as I was at a loss, I suddenly noticed the display screen on the building across the street telling me to jump down quickly. Looking at the agent outside my door, I had no choice but to leave this place. First, the train whistled frantically in warning. I struggled to my feet and finally jumped onto the platform. At the last moment, before I could catch my breath, the platform display screen reminded me again to board the train as fast as possible. After the train started moving, a phone kept ringing incessantly in the car. I looked around and found a man sleeping nearby, but his phone screen showed my name. Puzzled, I answered the call. The voice told me to get off. After three stops, I hung up directly. I was fed up with the mysterious person's remote control. I felt like a lab rat being played with. When the train reached the station, I got off and quickly ducked into the opposite car, thinking I could evade tracking this way. But the mysterious person sent another message saying that defying orders would have consequences. The next second, the train braked hard and then sped off in the opposite direction. I was shocked by their immense power. Just then, the phone rang again. The voice warned me not to play games anymore and ordered me to get off at Wilson Station where A black Porsche will be waiting at the exit. Listen. No, I'm done. The moment I hung up, everyone's phone in the car started ringing. A mysterious person told them I was a terrorist. The concerned citizens instantly became alert and the conductor hurried over. Just as I was panicking, the train door automatically opened while we were still moving.

Great. What is the next step? I want grandchildren. Whoever gets pregnant from my son 1st will become his wife. They thought I was tall and handsome, but in reality, I was sitting in a wheelchair because I'm disabled. My mother told me to go back to my room and wait. And the girls would come in one by one. Who's going to be first? Uh, me. As long as he's rich, I don't care about a wheelchair. The first girl came in and directly stated her intentions. Let's make you a baby. Just as she approached me, I rejected her. Not for me. For us. Okay. I'm ready to change our baby's diapers, breast feed. Do you really want to talk about this now? I just want you to understand the responsibility involved. Let's think about it a bit later, okay? Get out of my room. I drove her out of the room. She wasn't a responsible girl. The second girl changed into sexy clothes and danced in front of me. But she ignored the fact that I was disabled. I regretfully told her that I had lost my ability to have children. Why then your mother demanding all this? She just doesn't know that I can't give her a grandchild. Um, maybe I can review your. After all. Listen, maybe better go. And then I rejected her too. But the Third girl seemed different, as if she had some hidden pain. My son doesn't like to wait. She unwillingly walked in. After entering, she closed the curtains and walked toward me. I was looking forward to seeing what kind of surprise she might bring. When she got closer to me, I could tell she wasn't willing at all. I'm sorry. Sorry, I can't. Why did you come to my mother's competition then? I didn't have a choice. I was threatened with deportation. Getting married is the only way to get my documents. But. But I'm not ready to do all this. I admire you for staying true to your principles. Don't worry. I won't force you to do anything. You can go. She held on to her moral boundaries, and that made me deeply interested in her. Nine months later, the first two girls were both pregnant, but only the third girl wasn't. I see some of you managed to get pregnant. But I don't like lies. Ah, leave. My mother drove her away. My belly is real. You can touch it. I believe that you're carrying a beautiful baby. But not my son's. She kept pretending to be clueless, but my mother showed the evidence. In the end, she and the bodyguard were both kicked out. Just as the third girl was about to leave, I stopped her. The truth is, my mother always knew that I couldn't have children. And you are the only one who didn't try. To deceive us. I don't know if our relationship will work out, but I promise I'll do everything I can to make sure you're not deported. We will.

The woman kept complaining and the man had to continue fixing the engine. After a struggle, he got the boat's engine running, but they had no sense of direction. Having been stranded at sea for so long, their gas soon ran out and the boat ran aground again. Suddenly, the woman spotted a yacht ahead. The two frantically waved for help.

They soon reached the shore. The man climbed to the top of the island first, realizing it was a barren wasteland. Woman refused, asking him to climb back up and inspect it again. The man was exhausted and ignored her orders. The woman became angry and began yelling at him. The Man collapsed, leaving her alone. He had experienced surviving in the wild. And soon they were served grilled fish. The hungry woman was drawn in by the aroma, but the man, as punishment, threw her dirty clothes and made her do all the chores before she could eat.

I grew up inside an assassin organization. I wasn't only skilled in every pressure point on the human body. I could kill a target with a single move. To me, human life was as insignificant as an ant. Then, during a massacre, I watched a child beg for mercy between the cracks, and my heart broke. In that instant, I woke up. I decided to become a different person.

The shop owner realized they were bad news, so he grabbed a wooden stick from under the table and struck at them. Sadly, the owner was old and couldn't even hurt them. A waitress tried to step in to stop them, but one kick sent her flying. I watched from the side, torn inside. I just wanted To live a simple life and avoid trouble. When I saw the shop owner about to be beaten to death, I couldn't hold back. I lunged forward and grabbed one of the robbers. No matter how he thrashed and struck, he couldn't break free. The second man pulled a knife and moved in to help. He swung but missed me and instead cut the boss. The two robbers couldn't understand what was happening. They were supposed to be experts, but no matter how they hacked in slash, they couldn't land a hit on me. In desperation, the second man drew the boss's dagger and swung at me with all his might. Unexpectedly, that blow didn't hurt me. It sliced off the boss's ear instead, pain shot through his body. Seeing his brother fall, the boss lost his composure. He kicked him away and with a roar hurled me aside. The impact slammed the doors and windows shut. I hit the ground and crawled. The second man, trying to prove himself, sprang up to finish me off. But he jumped too high and couldn't land safely. He fell and died. The boss, furious and grief stricken, grabbed me, desperate to avenge his brother. Like a beast, he pounded me until I had no strength to fight back. Then, as if struck by something enormous, his body froze. After a stunned moment, he toppled into the water and didn't surface again.

This time, the students behaved a little better, but they still didn't care about me. Some were eating, some were sleeping, some were even playing games. And one of them was actually having hot pot in class. I introduced myself, but they all ignored me like I didn't exist. They thought that would stop me, but I had already prepared a little surprise for them. I picked up a rubber band and a piece of chalk from the desk. Within seconds, the whole class was soaked, while I stood under my umbrella with a proud smile. Even though they got taught a lesson, those troublemakers still didn't care about studying. So to get their attention, I let them smoke in class and told them whoever could answer my three questions correctly could leave early. Then I asked one of them to take out a pack of cigarettes and asked what the chemical components of a cigarette were. John was lucky enough to answer all three correctly. He walked out smugly, while everyone else looked jealous. Suddenly, the class became serious. Everyone wanted to be the next One to leave. But the school leader saw everything from afar and looked furious. I didn't care at all. I kept using my open and free teaching methods to show them the structure of cigarettes and the harm of smoking. Soon, the students actually started to enjoy my class. But one day, the smoker student suddenly went missing. After asking around, I Learned that he was working as a runner for a gang. So I went to their hideout alone to get him back. The place was full of brutal UFC fighters. When they saw a short and quiet teacher like me, they told me to get lost. Then I heard my student begging me for help from inside.

She was wearing light clothes. But in the photo a fur coat appeared out of nowhere. We thought the camera was broken until she pulled an old coat from a trunk, stood by the window and compared the pose, the angle which the photo perfectly. We decided to test it again. She aimed at the front door and pressed the shutter. The photo showed a young man pushing the door open. It was my brother in law. But that was impossible. He had just been sentenced to seven years, still in prison. I said this camera was cursed. The door really swung open and it was him. He said he'd escaped from prison, coming to find us. My wife and I were speechless. His posture pushing the door matched the photo exactly. Three of us were discussing when I suddenly realised this camera could see the future. About five minutes ahead. A wild idea shot into my mind. We could pull off something big. As we excitedly planned, the sound of a horse race broadcast came from the TV. I shot to my feet. If we could see the future, couldn't we win at betting? We scraped together all the cash we had, a few hundred bucks, and rushed to the track. Timing it right, I aimed at the scoreboard and pressed the shutter. The photo showed horse No. 7 Hegs 1. I ran to place the bet. The race started. Six stayed. In the middle, near the finish line, it suddenly surged ahead and won. We went crazy with joy. The scoreboard matched the photo exactly. Once greed takes hold, it's hard to suppress. With more cash, we bet again and again. We won every time. We had so much money, our hands grew tired counting it. Back home that night, I immediately ordered a sports car. A hotel server came to clear the table, picked up the camera curiously. I told him to be careful not to break my treasure. But he said after 10 photos, this camera would be useless. We quickly counted. Two shots in the room, six at the track. Only two chances left. I said tomorrow we had to do something bigger. My wife wanted to save them for later. My brother in law suggested we just sell it. We started fighting over it. And in the struggle, the shutter was pressed again. Another one wasted. That new photo showed my wife screaming. I immediately grabbed a knife. If the camera predicted trouble, I'd strike first. I shoved my wife aside and moved toward my brother in law. We struggled all the way to the window, wrestling. My wife stood exactly where she was in the photo. I heard my wife scream, just like in the photo. Everything happened too fast. A server rushed in, shoved all the money from the table into his bag. My wife tried to call for help. The server sneered, said her Brother was an escaped convict. Calling the police would get her arrested first. He took all the winnings, even the bag, from her hands. My wife rushed to the window to check on us, but tripped over a wire. She fell too. The last thing I saw was the server walking calmly to the window, just like the picture shows. One, two, three, four.

Just then a man walked in from outside and they were acting very close. I realized then that the boyfriend who bought her the shoes Was just a backup. While the woman wasn't looking, I deliberately damaged the shoes to buy myself some time. I need to check the merchandise. What the honey? What's wrong? They sold me defective sandals and don't want to take them back. During the argument, I secretly called her boyfriend. I confronted her asking why she was deceiving the boyfriend who loved her. And the woman replied that she just used him as a money making tool. The woman was gloating, but what she didn't know was that what happened next would catch her completely off guard. You didn't pay for them to take the money. I heard everything about your business.

The old man flipped the switch, sending a massive current surging through. The people on site were instantly pinned in place, their bodies gradually charring. Someone attempted a rescue, but they too met a grim fate. The scene descended into utter chaos. An officer spotted the cables on the floor and quickly evacuated the area. Annie dashed to the control panel, exerting all her strength to shut off the power. The current finally ceased, but the survivors gasp remained harsh. People panicked and rushed toward the exit. However, the massive iron door was already locked shut. A girl stepped forward and gently blew on the iron door. The cold metal turned transparent. The crowd surged wildly toward the door.

I struggled desperately but found nothing to grasp, forced to watch helplessly as my body tumbled downward. When I opened my eyes again, I found myself hanging upside down at 10,000 meters, the hemp rope around my waist saving my life. I remembered my companion in the basket and screamed for help with all my might, but he had already fallen unconscious from altitude sickness. As expected, I had to rely on myself. I began swaying my body and with every ounce of strength finally swung to the edge of the basket. I scrambled Back inside, barely catching my breath before checking on him. But no matter how loudly I called, he showed no response. Tears welled up in my eyes. Then a miracle happened.

But she told me a shocking secret. She said if I use this spoon to eat three meals at a rich man's house, I would become the son of a wealthy family. Hearing how convincing she sounded, I, born into poverty, wanted to change my fate. That day, I happened to deliver some documents to my rich classmate. When I saw how luxurious his home was, I became even more determined to get rich. But when I stood before my classmate Mark, he humiliated me in front of everyone. He tossed me some pocket money and told me to leave. That scene was witnessed by another classmate, and I was too ashamed to stay for dinner. Just as I was about to go, Tony suddenly invited me to join them for dinner. Mark looked annoyed, but since it was Tony's house, he couldn't object. Soon everyone sat down to eat. But Mark said someone like me didn't deserve to sit at the table. He even stopped the maid from giving me utensils. I didn't get angry at his insults because it gave me the perfect chance to use my golden spoon. The moment I took a few bites with it, a golden glow appeared on the spoon. To get another chance to dine at Tony's house, I offered to write his asset management report. But Mark saw everything. He warned me to stay away from Tony. He said I could never reach the life of the rich. After beating me up, he turned and left. But his actions only made me more determined to switch lives with Tony. Later, I returned to Tony's house.

Then he started scolding his son, saying that befriending poor people was a waste of time. Tony didn't dare talk back. He packed up my things and kicked me out. But as I reached the door, I couldn't accept it. Looking down at the golden spoon in my hand, I felt full of resentment. When no one was watching, I quietly snuck back in, grabbed a bowl of food from the maid, and started eating fast. That's how I finished my second meal at the rich man's house. But just then, Tony's parents appeared. I froze in embarrassment, then hurried to leave. But Tony's mother noticed I'd forgotten my spoon. She called out to me and handed me the spoon in its wooden case with a disgusted look. Then I turned and walked away. They had no idea I'd soon come back as their son.

Jack told her she was running in the wrong direction and drew a map on the ground. Seeing his calm demeanor, the woman slowly let her guard down. But suddenly the sound of hounds echoed from afar. Jack quickly told her to lie in his carriage and covered her with a cloth. Moments later, the slave hunters arrived. Jack stayed calm, and even when they asked if he'd seen the runaway, he said that even if he did, he'd never tell them. One of the hunters grew suspicious and tried to check the carriage, but Jack's throwing knife pinned his hand to the wagon before he could move, then pulled out his revolver, aiming it at the others.

I wanted to feel invisibility myself. I gathered the team again. I pushed the needle into my own body. Soon, my skin faded away. Only pale bones remained until I was completely invisible. For safety, they took turns watching over me. On the first night, the assistant fell asleep. A dark thought crossed my mind. I moved closer to her. When she woke up, clothes were In disarray, she ran to check the cameras, and on the screen, I was lying in bed. She understood everything instantly, but I refused to admit it, and the matter was quietly buried. Three days later, I injected the visible serum. The moment it entered my body, something impossible began to happen.

The strange thing was while we were on the plane, we didn't notice anything unusual at all. We only thought it was a normal 3 hour flight. But the outside world believed we had already met with disaster. When ground control heard our plane requesting to land, they were instantly shocked. After multiple confirmations, they finally approved our landing at a remote airport. After getting off the plane, we were surrounded by crowds of police and reporters. We were completely puzzled by this scene. Then a detective spoke up. Problem, ladies and gentlemen, is your plane departed Montego Bay, Jamaica on April 7th, 2,013. Today is November 4th, 2,018. You've all been missing, presumed dead for five and a/2 years. We were extremely shocked after hearing him. After the police conducted their investigation and found no abnormalities, they notified us that we could meet with our families. My brother's wife came rushing over, very emotional. It's okay. We're okay. We're okay. I don't understand. How are you? Exactly the same. You haven't aged a day. The twin brother and sister also showed a huge age gap. Now, but then I noticed my mother didn't come. My father told me she had died of illness two years ago. The next day I reported to the police station but discovered my position no longer existed when chatting with my boyfriend, whom I hadn't Seen for years, I noticed the wedding ring on his hand. And his marriage partner was my best friend. I left heartbroken. But as I sat on the bus home, a woman's voice suddenly appeared in my mind. Slower. Excuse me. Can you slow down? Excuse me. Do I come to your work and tell you how to do your job? Slower, slower, slow down. Now, how'd you see him coming, lady? How the hell? I was very confused about this. After returning home, I told my brother about this incident. After hearing it, he warned me not to tell anyone or I might be taken away for research. The next day during my morning jog, when I passed by a warehouse, that voice appeared again. Set them free. Set them free. But I didn't pay attention and turned to leave. But that night, while I was sleeping soundly, I was awakened again. Set them free! Set them free. So I had no choice but to go to that warehouse again. Just then, my brother also drove over. It turned out he had heard the same calling, too. We then opened the iron gate and let two dogs out. But unexpectedly, all of this was recorded by someone who also called the police. Fortunately, the case was handled by my ex boyfriend, Jack. He thought I was deliberately trying to get revenge on him, so he scolded me and then took me to return the dogs. But as soon as We reached the warehouse, set them free. Then I followed the voice and walked into the warehouse's backyard, arriving at a locked room. She directly picked up an iron bar and smashed it against the lock. Ignoring their attempts to stop me, I broke the lock open. After opening the door, I discovered two girls were imprisoned inside. The warehouse owner immediately grabbed an iron bar and swung it at Jack. Fortunately, he reacted quickly and subdued the man. The girls were rescued and I was reinstated to my original position because of this. But that night, all of us passengers from Flight 8, 28 received what felt like a calling and came to the airport together. Parked inside was exactly the Flight 8, 2, 8 plane. Before we could react.

We had to secretly use the neighbor's sprinkler to bathe. Even going out to eat was a big deal. We'd spend all our money at a buffet just to fill our stomachs. So my wife and I decided to forget about it. We went to rob a bank. We walked into the lobby. Bang! My wife fell to the ground, pretending to faint. A guard rushed over. I stole the key card from his belt and grabbed a briefcase at random. The door buzzed open like magic. Suddenly, my wife recovered. At the vault entrance, a worker tried to stop me. Can I help you, vault inspector? What happened to Phil? Necrotizing fasciitis caused by an invasive streptococcus. I calmly said I was there for an inspection. Completely convincing the vault was stacked with cash. I started loading it up. But then a group of real armed robbers showed up. Panic staff hit the emergency button. The police arrived immediately. Outside, my wife was terrified. She thought I was dead inside. I crawled out of the vault like a professional. Collapsed to the ground, playing the helpless hostage. The police broke in and took control. When they tore off the mask of the leader, I nearly fainted. It was a former classmate of mine.

Je ne m'attendais pas à tomber par hasard sur mon ex. Mon cœur s'est serré, j'ai fait semblant de ne pas l'avoir et j'ai voulu partir discrètement mais elle m'a bloqué sur place. J'ai dû lui adresser 1 sourire gêné et la saluer. Je n'avais qu'une envie, c'était de m'éclipser alors j'ai prétexté de devoir partir avec ma fille. Mais à l'instant suivant, ma nièce a révélé mon mensonge d'une seule phrase. En voyant mon ex rire à cette remarque, je ne savais plus où me mettre. Il y a 4 ans, j'étais encore à la fac. La 1ère fois que j'ai vu mon ex, c'était la plus belle-fille de l'université. J'ai cuu 1 coup de foudre pour elle, alors j'ai fait exprès de la croiser à la bibliothèque et j'ai profité de l'occasion pour lui parler. Mais j'étais si nerveux que je lui ai serré la main sans la lâcher. Elle est devenue toute rouge de gêne. Pour la conquérir, j'ai changé de filière pour participer à 1 concours qu'elle aimait. J'ai remporté la médaille d'or et je lui ai fait ma déclaration en public. C'est ainsi que nous avons commencé à sortir ensemble. Plus tard, elle m'a même accompagné en mission de volontariat. Elle me voyait si positif et souriant qu'elle pensait être la fille la plus heureuse du monde. Elle rêvait même de notre futur mariage. Mais tout s'est écroulé en Dernière année, le jour de mon anniversaire, elle avait préparé 1 cadeau en avance. Elle voulait me faire 1 surprise et même me demander en mariage. Mais c'est moi qui ai détruit ce bonheur de mes propres mains. J'ai repoussé son bouquet et je lui ai dit froidement que je voulais rompre. Elle est restée figée sur place et j'ai lutté pour ne pas me retourner. Je ne pensais pas qu'après 4 ans, elle deviendrait ma nouvelle supérieure. La 1ère fois que je l'ai revue au bureau, j'ai paniqué et j'ai caché mon visage derrière 1 dossier de peur qu'elle me reconnaisse. Alors, quand elle m'a interrogé, j'ai prétexté 1 torticolis. Mais après avoir vu ça, elle m'a dit de faire le rapport mensuel du mois dernier. Je n'ai pas eu d'autre choix que d'accepter, mais je savais qu'elle me faisait faire 1 mois de travail en 1 demi-journée. C'était clairement de la vengeance personnelle et elle souriait joyeusement face à ma frustration. Pour finir rapidement, j'ai dû demander de l'aide à 1 ami. Après quelques menaces et promesses, il a finalement accepté. J'ai pu finir la tâche avant la fin de la journée. À ce moment-là, j'ai regardé ma montre, c'était l'heure de sortie de l'école pour ma nièce, alors j'ai voulu remettre le rapport à mon ex avant de partir. Mais en ouvrant la porte, je suis tombé sur son visage familier et j'ai été ébloui 1 nouvelle fois. Les souvenirs de mon coup de foudre ont ressurgi D'un coup, heureusement, je me suis vite ressaisie et je lui ai remis le rapport terminé. Mais elle s'est mise à me taquiner en me demandant pourquoi. Cette fois, je ne cachais pas mon visage et en voyant mon efficacité, elle m'a confié 3 nouvelles propositions à préparer pour le lendemain. J'ai compris qu'elle voulait me pousser à bout et m'obliger à démissionner, mais en pensant à ma sœur malade et au frais de scolarité de ma nièce, je n'ai eu d'autre choix que de sourire et d'accepter. Mais c'est là qu'elle a remarqué que je portais encore le bracelet qu'elle m'avait offert à l'époque et elle a commencé à se demander si j'avais eu 1 raison cachée de rompre. Pendant ce temps, mes amis, ayant appris que ma nouvelle patronne était mon ex, sont venus curieux pour en savoir plus. Mais mon ex est arrivé à ce moment-là et m'a dit que le dossier n'était pas urgent. Elle m'a même proposé d'aller ensemble chez 1 médecin traditionnel pour mon torticolis. Mes amis ont compris la situation et se sont éclipsés prix de panique. J'ai immédiatement refusé et j'ai inventé 1 excuse disant que je devais aller chercher ma fille à l'école. Mais juste après avoir récupéré ma nièce, j'ai remarqué que mon ex me regardait et quand ma nièce l'a vu à son tour, elle a dit tout haut, la dame, des photos dans ton téléphone est là. J'ai dû la réprimander pour qu'elle se taise, puis j'ai menti. En disant que c'était ma fille et que je devais partir. Mais ma nièce a non seulement avoué qui elle était vraiment, elle a aussi chuchoté à mon ex que toutes les photos de mon téléphone étaient d'elle. En entendant cela, mon ex s'est mise à sourire de bonheur. Le lendemain, elle regardait nos anciennes photos de couple et a juré de me reconquérir. Ce moment-là, je suis arrivée dans son bureau et quand elle m'a remis le résultat de l'évaluation trimestrielle, j'ai été stupéfait, c'était 1 avis de licenciement. Furieux, j'ai jeté mon badge sur la table mais j'ai renversé 1 verre d'eau. Par mes gardes, toute l'eau s'est renversée sur sa jupe. En la voyant paniquer, j'ai instinctivement voulu l'aider à essuyer. En voyant qu'elle s'était blessée, je me suis appliqué à lui soigner la plaie, mais cette scène pleine d'ambiguïté a été vue par la secrétaire de mon ex.

I've always dreamed of owning a prehistoric saber tiger. But now it's trapped and about to drown. I had planned to raise my spear and kill this fierce beast, but seeing the helplessness and desperation in its eyes, I just couldn't bring myself to do it. No! Do not eat me when I set you free. Though I wasn't sure if it could understand me, I used every ounce of strength to move the wooden stakes, pinning it down. Surprisingly, once freed, this hungry sabertoothed tiger showed no dread. Instead, it bared its fangs, slowly approached me, as if trying to memorize my face. I had no idea that this escaped sabertoothed tiger would change my destiny in pinnacles. My name is Dolly, and I live in a primitive tribe from 10,000 years ago. For generation, we've survived by hunting mammoths, successfully capturing just one feed our entire tribe through the winter. But as the environment changed, mammoths arrived later and later, sometimes not at all. Our people often went hungry, teetering on the edge of death every single day. To escape this predicament, our tribal shaman prayed to gods day and night, but never received an answer. Then one day, hunters discovered a stranded little girl at the foot of the mountain and brought her back to our tribe. The moment the shaman saw her crystal blue eyes, he immediately realized that the ancestral spirits wanted to communicate. Through this girl, he placed his Hands on her cheeks sense her energy, but unexpectedly witnessed a bone chilling vision. Through the girl's experience of her tribe's massacre, the shaman for saw that our tribe would face a brutal invasion by four horn demons during our final hunt. But we shouldn't be afraid, because a warrior would rise up and lead our people to a life where they'd never go hungry again. Fortunate the shaman couldn't see the warrior's face. The only certainty was that this little girl named Yvel would become his wife and bring New Hope to our tribe. While these words were encouraging, my father, as a tribal chief, knew deep down the prophecies alone couldn't save our people from their plight. To find a way to survive as quickly as possible, he painfully left. Dill just a child, entrusting the white fur symbolizing Protection and responsibility. Close friend tick, asking him to keep it secret to take care of me. Then he walked alone into the vast snowy mountains and was never heard from again.

Feeling completely hopeless, I panicked and ran to the kitchen, grabbed a knife, and rushed out. But my coworker had already vanished into the night. I broke down crying uncontrollably. The next day, Luther woke up groggy, completely clueless about what happened last night. He saw I was upset and asked what was wrong, but I didn't want to tell him. After he kept pushing, I told him everything that happened that night. Luther was furious and full of regret, not knowing how to comfort me, so he just held me while I let it all out. The next day, Luther ate a big meal to get his strength back, determined to kill the man who hurt me. But he quickly realized he was no match for him. When I came home, I found a letter from Luther apologizing, saying he needed to leave for a while. Luther started training intensely, desperate to get stronger. He knew that only by avenging me could he face me again. What he didn't know was that I was already pregnant, and what I needed most was him by my side.

Coach, you are Brandon Burleson, right? Yes, sir. Go get your gear, lunch box. My overweight body made me the laughing stock of the recruitment. Coach gave me walk on status, no scholarship. I was about to follow the other players when the coach stopped me and told me the walk on lockers were in the back. I hung my head and walked back, hearing nothing but my teammates laughter behind me. At practice the next day, my teammates all moved with steady rhythm while I stumbled around out of sink and fell flat on my face. The coach pulled me up from the ground and told me that if I wanted to earn a scholarship with the Razorbacks, I'd need to develop solid footwork and technique. That's what it would take for me to become a real lineman. The assistant coach in white thought he was wasting his time on me. This ain't a fantasy camp. He's a walk on stick, a block and dummy in his hand. We got two weeks before the season start. Everybody on my line's gonna get a chance, coach. We just might find a diamond in the rough. Because of my high body fat percentage, the coach designed a special training program just for me. The workouts were brutal, but I wasn't about to quit. I stuck to the coach's plan every single day. Rain or shine, wind or storm, I never stop before Long I finally beat out a scholarship player during a running drill. There is no tomorrow. Will you let the turd beat you? To test my progress, the coach matched me up against the best scholarship player on the team. Before the drill started, the coach figured there was still a huge gap between us. The goal was just to work on my footwork and not embarrass myself too badly, but I thought I could take him. When the whistle blew, I gave it everything I had. Ward fought hard to hold me back, but I still managed to drive him out. The field went dead silent. Even the coach couldn't believe it. Okay, let's try that again. Yeah. The moment the coach finished speaking, everyone erupted with excitement. They started getting rowdy, which pissed Ward off. I got down in my stance and set up. When the whistle blew again, I exploded into him and drove him backward. This time I put him flat on his back. The whole team went absolutely crazy. What is wrong with you? You just got your butt kicked by a walk on, coach. I've played against walk ons that it's no walk on.

Look, I felt like I messed up so bad with you, and then when I tried it again the other day, I messed up again. Well, what'll be different this time? I need a girl like you to keep me in line. And how about a date? What were you thinking? You know what? Uh, yeah. This was a huge mistake. Oh! Oh! Stay away from my girlfriend.

The kidnappers were constantly monitoring her movements, ready to activate the remote controlled bomb on the wall at the first sign of anything unusual. That moment, Jack was positioned perfectly in the surveillance blind spot, slowly maneuvering the mirror he had prepared. The surveillance feed showed nothing out of the ordinary. Jack cautiously shifted his body along the floor when one of his feet became exposed. Fortunately, his partner alerted him just in time, preventing his detection. Soon, Jack reached the blind spot and quickly hung up the painting he had brought, identical to the one in the monitored area. He then set up a mannequin matching Anna's build and placed it on the stool. Anna had to maintain the exact same posture as the mannequin so that from behind she would be virtually indistinguishable from it. Next, Jack swiftly fitted the camera with the mirror device he had crafted, completely replacing the real feed with a false one. Kidnappers detected nothing unusual on their monitors. Anna's movements appeared perfectly normal. Jack hurriedly guided Anna to escape through the floor. They had little time left from the kidnappers, less than a minute. Just then, Jack's partner appeared and they moved quickly to save several valuable paintings. At the critical moment, the kidnappers called to remind them that the Ransom hadn't been received, growing suspicious because Anna hadn't moved for 90 seconds just as they Were about to enter the underground passage.

Suddenly started raining outside. I took a closer look at the model. Holy crap. It's an exact replica of my town. There's even a tiny figure on top of the church that looks exactly like me. On a whim, pulled a tiny tree off the model. The real tree in town was instantly ripped out of the ground. It hit me right then. This model controls the actual town. I immediately poured some water on the model near the church. Sure enough, a massive rainstorm hit around me. The other side of town stayed sunny. People started talking about the weird weather. My girlfriend complained that the fresh paint at her restaurant got ruined by the unexpected storm. That made me smile. When she wasn't looking, I swiped the nail polish from her desk. Then I painted the model restaurant from top to bottom with it. The next day, my girlfriend was stunned to see the restaurant had turned orange. She said it was her favorite color. I was pretty pleased with myself. Then an old lady fell right next to me. Turns out there was a pothole that hadn't been fixed in years. The old lady said she'd complained to the mayor countless times. The complaint box is overflowing, but nothing ever got fixed. I realized I shouldn't just think about myself. I should use this model to help the whole town. I haul the entire complaint box back home, ready to Tackle the residents problems one by one. I used a booger to fill the potholes on the model. The real potholes were instantly filled. I used tweezers to pick up the trash on the model. The trash on the streets vanished in an instant. But these weird changes freaked out the dog downstairs and it wouldn't stop barking. To shut it up, I placed a bone next to it on the model. Now that dog has enough food to last until retirement. The next day, I walked the streets admiring my work. But everyone thought the mayor did all this. They decided to vote for his reelection. Even worse, that shameless mayor actually took credit for it. I was furious. Looking at the mayor's red sports car, I decided to teach him a lesson.

I didn't have the courage to get out of the car and retrieve my sister's head. After catching my breath, I started the car and returned home like a soulless shell. That entire night, I lay in bed wanting nothing but to escape until dawn when mom discovered my headless sister in the car. The next second came heart wrenching screams, unstoppable despair and sorrow. She couldn't find peace and moved to sleep in my sister's small wooden cabin. I couldn't sleep night after night, tormented repeatedly by my sister's death. Only dad seems somewhat normal, often sitting quietly in my sister's room lost in memories. And one evening at dinner, emotions that had been suppressed for so long finally erupted. And I know it was an accident. And I know you're in pain. And I wish I could take that away from you. I wish I could shield you from the knowledge that you did what you did, but your sister is dead. She's gone forever. Later at the supermarket entrance, mom ran into a friend who had also lost her son. Friend mysteriously told her that through a certain ritual, she could summon her daughter spirit. Seeing that mom didn't believe in such things, she immediately offered to demonstrate. She lit a candle and recited an incantation and the cup miraculously began moving on its own. Even more eerie, chock started writing automatically on the drawing board. Before going home, her friend taught her the summoning method. That very night, she called dad and me to the living room, took out my sister's sketchbook from when she was alive and began the summoning. The moment she finished the incantation, the candle flame shot up violently. Then mom seemed possessed, beginning to scream and yell. From that point on, strange things kept happening. I constantly felt something following behind me and mysterious halos of light appeared around me. Even more terrifying, I saw my reflection in the glass wearing a sinister smile, but I wasn't smiling at all. Mom also became increasingly volatile, throwing tantrums and smashing things. Then she discovered that in my sister's sketchbook, a portrait of me had somehow drawn itself and she had dreamed of me dead in bed. These eerie occurrences made mom realize that what she had summoned wasn't my sister, but some other malevolent spirit. So she burned the sketchbook. Mom then rushed to her friend's house only to find it completely empty. But it appeared that a ritual had just been performed there, and in the center of the table sat a photograph of me.

The anesthesia kept her deep asleep and I leaned closer. My hands wouldn't leave her. My lips brushed her skin. For 28 long minutes, I didn't stop. Only when her parents burst into the room did I finally let go. The father called me a hero for saving his daughter. The mother kissed me on the cheek, overflowing with thanks. But none of that mattered to me. My eyes stayed on Lisa, still lying helpless on that bed. That moment, I swore I would make her mine, no matter the cost. The next morning, she woke uneasy, convinced something had happened. Her parents brushed it off, saying it was the medicine. They couldn't imagine something so vile inside a hospital, but they were too naive. Once they left, I returned, pretending it was routine rounds. I claimed she needed her bandages changed and took advantage. Again, Lisa was too innocent to sense my intentions. Only when her mother came back with food did I stop. I kept insisting I was only changing dressings. Her mother, uneasy, asked Lisa herself. Hearing nothing unusual, she finally relaxed. Half a month later, Lisa was discharged. She only needed regular checkups moving forward. Before leaving, she gave me a hug and gratitude. Her mother noticed my hand wandering but stayed silent. That silence only fueled my obsession. Lisa's face lingered in my mind day and night. A week later, my assistant said Lisa was back. I freshened my breath and rushed to see her. She brought me a doll and a thank you note. When she mentioned studying medicine, I eagerly offered help. Her mother grew uneasy at my enthusiasm. She warned Lisa not to wear short skirts or low cut tops, but Lisa ignored her, caught in her rebellious phase. Her mother's instincts were right. I began following Lisa, waiting where she ate. I paid off her friends just to get her alone. At first, she thought nothing of it. But when my hand reached for her, she froze in fear. She made an excuse and walked away fast. Her rejection pierced me like a blade. I kicked over trash cans to vent my rage. Later, Lisa told her parents everything. She begged them to change her doctor. Her father thought she imagined it all. He trusted my awards, my reputation, my past patients. He thought a man like me couldn't do such things. Her mother stood by Lisa, certain I was dangerous. At last, the father confronted me. I laughed in his face, saying I was no criminal. I claimed physical contact was part of treatment. Then I showed him the doll and letter she gave me. I hinted she was the one being forward. He was speechless, but still asked to switch doctors. I warned him it would harm her care. I told him I was the best surgeon money could buy. Reluctantly, he gave in. Her mother followed. His decision. That night, I hid near Lisa's house. When the family left, I slipped inside. I lay on her bed, breathing her scent. I imagined her in my arms, mine at last. Suddenly, she came home with her boyfriend. I panicked and hid in the storage room. I watched him pull out a ring and propose. He kissed her while whispering sweet lies. My chest felt like it was being torn apart. I wanted to attack him, to rip him away from her. Only her unhealed wound stopped him from going further. That night, I broke completely. All I thought about was tearing them apart. Soon the chance came. Her boyfriend had a leg injury and came often for treatment. I stole his phone while he wasn't looking. I sent cruel messages about Lisa to his friends. One of them linked it straight to Lisa. Enraged, she broke up with him. Immediately, the boy tried to prove his innocence with alibis. He realized the timing pointed straight at me. He stormed in demanding answers. I denied it, but he saw through everything. He knew I wanted Lisa for myself. Rage took over him completely. He grabbed his crutch and swung it at me. Come on.

However, as he drew closer, he was instantly drained and turned into a dried up corpse. The fairy who had broken the seal revealed her true form as the monster lunged at him with lightning speed. Jack gathered every ounce of his strength to break free from his restraints. He seized the creature by the neck and slammed it hard into the ground. But the monster seemed to possess immortality, quickly reforming and returning to human shape. Seeing this, the two disciples acted quickly, throwing the binding fairy rope to restrain the creature. Jack, seizing the chance, prepared to unleash a long lost secret technique. At that critical moment, however, the monster transformed into his beloved deceased daughter. Jack was immediately flooded with painful memories. Years ago, due to his past as a Tomb Raider, enemies had come to his home, leading to his daughter's tragic death. After that, Jack retired from his criminal life, swearing never to return to his old ways. But today, his junior brother Mike had tricked him into searching for the immortal fairy's body with the warlord Ryan. Now Jack's longing for his daughter had become an obsessive torment, pulling him uncontrollably toward the monster. Despite his disciples calls, he remained unmoved. At this critical moment, Jack was jolted back to reality by a wooden carving. This figurine had been crafted By his disciples specifically for him. Jack snapped back to the present, but the monster, still in the form of his daughter, continued to beckon from the stage. The illusion of the fairy Mugu kept calling out, but Jack made a decisive choice. With a piercing scream, the monster finally revealed its true form. It turned out that from the moment they had entered the tomb's entrance, what had appeared to be smoke was not smoke at all. It was the pollen of a giant nutmeg flower. The flower's pollen contained potent hallucinogenic properties. Once inhaled, it paralyzed its victims, causing vivid and terrifying hallucinations. Mike, who had been obsessed with seeking immortality, was consumed by the nutmeg, turning into nothing more than a meal for the flower, lost forever inside its monstrous belly.

He was thrown out of the theater. To get home, caught a ride with a passing car. Soon he realized something was wrong. The girl in the front seat was eating raw pig liver and the car was heading the wrong way. He demanded to get out, but the driver ignored him. Angry, Mike tried to grab the steering wheel, accidentally brushing against the woman's stomach. That's when he realized she was pregnant. Suddenly, the woman went into labor before Mike's terrified eyes. She gave birth to a monster. The others in the car were thrilled, panicked. Mike shoved a pacifier into his mouth to stay silent. But the next second, the creature burst out of the car. Mike's disappearance left the police with no clues, and his friends seemed to have received a signal. First was Anna. That day, she was washing up when she heard singing from the drain. Peering down, she was horrified to see a human finger reaching out. Anna suspected Mike was trapped in the sewer, but no one believed her. Next was Jack. He was reading when his desk lamp suddenly went out. When he turned it back on, the lamp had turned into a human face. Jack screamed in terror. But the moment his brother Emma walked in, everything went back to normal. Now Jack finally believed Anna's theory. They thought Mike was calling for help, so they secretly investigated His disappearance. Their search LED them to the same movie theater Mike had gone to. But once they arrived, something strange began to happen.

But this time the real horror wasn't claws or fangs. It was a royal secret. Buried in blood, bodies were scattered across the ground, and Gerald felt a deep unease rise within him. Kneeling beside one of the fallen, he noticed the wolf medallion on the corpse. It confirmed his fear. The witches had not run away with stolen coin. They had been slain by a monster. Triss had hidden this truth. He fear what panic might erupt if people discovered that even the strongest witches could be brought down by a beast. As Geralt inspected the corpse further, he slit his hand into the ruptured abdomen. Both the heart and the liver were missing. Only one kind of creature was so selective in its feeding, a striga. And striga were not natural creatures. They were born of curses, which meant Princess Ada had not died in childbirth. She had been murdered. Chris immediately brought Gerald before King Fultus, begging him to allow the monster in the castle to be destroyed. But the king said nothing. He continued chewing his food as if his sister's death meant little to him. The captain of the guard firmly forbade anyone from disturbing the people's beloved. Ada, hearing his sister had been murdered, left fultest, unmoved. Only when the subject of the child's father arose did his expression falter. Carol suspected then that the king himself was the Father racked with guilt, Fultes preferred silence, allowing the Strega to continue its slaughter. But royal decrees held no sway over witches. Gerald and Tris slipped into the castle on the hill. Inside, the halls were cloaked in shadow and stank of rot. The princess's chambers lay in ruin, long abandoned. Triss, meticulous in her search, discovered several letters hidden within the secret compartment of a music box. In them, Queen Sanchia revealed that she knew of her son and daughter's forbidden union. Stricken with grief, she begged her daughter to rid herself of the child, but the princess refused, and in the end, the queen died. Consumed by hatred, Gerald caught the scent of black magic on the bed sheets. In the entire kingdom, only one man wielded such power, the royal mage Astrid. When Gerald confronted him, Astrid finally dropped his facade and confessed he had always loved Princess Ada, yet she gave her heart to her own brother. Driven by jealousy and guided by duney schemes, ostrit poisoned the princess and cursed her daughter, turning the infant into Astrea. To break the curse, Gerald would have to battle the beast until dawn. He chained ostrit inside Ada's chamber, drawing the monster from the crypt beneath the castle. Soon, a piercing shriek echoed through the halls. The strega emerged. Its back bore stunted wings that never fully formed, its lower body stretched into long, spindly legs and a grotesque umbilical cord dragged along the grounds, scraping against the Stone for over a decade, it had known nothing but hunger and rage. Gerald could not kill it. He could only endure. Parry dodge resist, buying precious seconds, fighting to hold on until the first light of dawn. When the sun finally rose, the striga was forced back toward its coffin, but Gerald was already inside, blocking its refuge. With no escape, the monster rived and shriek until the curse collapsed upon itself. Its flesh melted into blood and rot, the twisted body dissolving into filth until at last the form of a young girl remained. The strega was gone.

Nobody told me about a reservation. Tyler jumped in. We thought you were busy. I wasn't busy. I was never busy. They just didn't tell me. My sister said it was in the chat. Like that explained everything. I stood there holding flowers in a gift bag, watching my entire family awkwardly shuffle toward the door. My mom gave me this pitying smile. We can do something next week, just the two of us. I left the flowers on the counter and walked out. That's when I decided I was done asking. Christmas came around, and I didn't reach out. Didn't ask about plans, didn't text to confirm anything. Just waited. Two days before Christmas, my sister texted, you coming to mom and Dad's on the 25th? I said I wasn't invited. She sent me a screenshot from the group chat. The one I'm still not in. Where they've been planning for weeks. Menu, who is bringing what, what time to arrive, everything. I stared at that screenshot for a long time. Then I replied, let me know when there's a chat I'm actually part of. She tried calling. I declined it. My mom texted, of course, first you're invited. Your family. I didn't respond. I spent Christmas with my girlfriend's family instead. Her mom hugged me when I arrived and said she was glad I could make it. They'd set a place for me at the table. They asked about my life. They Included me in their traditions. It felt better than any Christmas I'd had with my own family. My mom called me crying on the 26th, asking why I didn't come. I said, you never invited me, just like you never added me to the chat. I'm done chasing people who don't want me around. She tried to guilt me, said I was being cruel, that I ruined Christmas. I said, you've been ruining it for years. You just didn't notice because I kept showing up anyway. Then I hung up. My dad texted, saying I was being dramatic and immature. I blocked all of them for a month. When I finally unblocked them, there was a new group chat notification. Family plus daughter. I opened it, saw weeks of messages. My mom apologizing, Tyler saying they should have handled things better. Mia asking me to give them another chance. I left the chat immediately and texted my mom directly. If you want me in your life, you know how to reach me one on one. She never responded.

It was bought with stolen money. Yes, I can. Derek blocked my path. The kids are mine. The kids are 7 and 9. Old enough to tell a judge. Who takes care of them? Who helps with homework? Who goes to their games and recitals? His jaw clenched. We both knew the answer. Me, you. We're never home, Derek. You were too busy with Vanessa. This is blackmail. No, this is consequences. You wanted a divorce? Congratulations. You're getting one. On my terms. I walked to the door, stopped. Oh, and Derek? I called Vanessa's husband this afternoon, gave him copies of everything. He's filing for divorce, too, and naming you as the cause. Derek's knees buckled. He sat down hard. You destroyed my life, he whispered. No, you destroyed it yourself. I'm just making sure everyone knows what you did. Patricia started crying. How could you be so cruel? How could you raise a son who thinks he can steal from his wife and cheat on his family? I left them sitting there, both crying. Drove to my sister's house, where my kids were having a sleepover. They didn't need to see their father's world collapse. Two days later, Derek's attorney called mine. My client would like to negotiate. No negotiation. He accepts my terms, or we go to court with all the evidence. Derek accepted. I got the house, primary custody. He paid back the $340,000. Patricia had to sell her house to cover it. Vanessa's husband got full custody of their kids. She lost everything, too. Derek sees our children every other weekend. Supervised. Because I don't trust him. Last week, he asked if we could talk. The kids miss me, he said. Then you should have thought about that before you cheated and stole from us. I made a mistake. You made a thousand mistakes. Every lie, every secret account, every hotel room. Can't you forgive me? I thought about that dinner. His mother's cruel words, his smug face. No. Some things can't be forgiven. They can only be remembered. I closed the door. Inside, my kids were laughing, safe, happy. Without him, we were better. And that's all that mattered.

My attorney, a forensic accountant, and a private investigator. Patricia's wine glass stopped halfway to her lips. What did you do? Derek's voice went tight. I did what I should have done two years ago when you started acting suspicious. I investigated. I opened the folder, spread documents across the table. This is your bank account. The one you thought I didn't know about. The one with $85,000 in it. Derek's face went white. Money you've been siphoning from our joint accounts for three years. That's my money. Our money, marital assets. You've been hiding it. That's illegal. I pulled out more papers. These Are credit card statements. You've been taking someone named Vanessa on vacation. Four trips in 18 months. Trisha sat down her glass. Who's Vanessa? His paralegal. 24 years old. Also married. Derek stood up. You had no right. I had every right. You're my husband. You vowed to be faithful. I kept going. This is the deed to your mother's house. Trisha's eyes widened. How did you. The house you claimed you bought with your retirement savings, you didn't. Derek bought it with our money. $340,000 without my knowledge or consent. That was a gift for my mother. Using marital funds without spouse's consent. Also illegal. I pulled out photos. Derek and Vanessa holding hands, kissing, entering a hotel. Your investigator followed you for six weeks, documented everything. Derek grabbed for the photos. I pulled them back. These are copies. The originals are with my attorney. Patricia found her voice. This is entrapment. No, this is evidence of adultery, of financial fraud, of your son being a lying, cheating thief. I stood up, gathered my papers. So here's what's actually going to happen.

For my entire childhood, my family had this group chat. Mom, dad, my older brother Tyler, and my younger sister Mia, everyone except me. I found out when I was 16. I walked into the kitchen and they were all laughing about something. When I asked what was funny, they got quiet. Tyler slipped and said it was just something in the chat. What chat? My mom tried to play it off, oh, just a silly family thing. You know how it is. But I didn't know because I wasn't in it. I thought maybe it was a mistake. So I asked my dad to add me later. He said, sure, honey, but he never did. Then I started noticing thing they'd all go to dinner on random Tuesdays, take weekend trips I only heard about after my sister got concert tickets from the family chat. My brother knew about my cousin's wedding three months before I did. Every single time I asked to be included, they'd say, oh yeah, we'll add you and then just wouldn't. I tried bringing it up seriously once, sat my mom down and said, it really hurts that I'm not in the family chat. She laughed, actually laughed, sweetheart, you're so sensitive. It's just a group chat. Just a group chat where they planned literally everything without me. My dad said I was making a big Deal out of nothing. Tyler told me to stop being weird about it. Mia said you wouldn't even use it anyway. But how would they know? They never gave me the chance. Last year, my brother got engaged. I found out three weeks later when I saw the photos on Facebook. Three weeks. It all known the night it happened because he announced it in the chat. When I confronted him, he said, I figured someone told you. Nobody did because nobody thought about me. Then came my mom's birthday last month. I showed up at her house with flowers and a gift I'd spent two hours picking out. When I walked in, they were all dressed up, grabbing their coats.

He just started loading boxes. They were fake boxes. Old textbooks, kitchen junk I'd pulled from my garage. He never questioned it. We drove back in silence for the first hour. Then he bought me breakfast at a truck stop and said, you'll land on your feet, man. You always do. I almost told him right there. That afternoon, I called my lawyer and had her draft the Paper paperwork. By Monday morning, Benji had a $2 Million trust fund in his name, full college tuition covered for his two kids, and a 10% partnership offer in my next venture. I didn't make a big announcement. I just texted him, check your email. Read everything. He called me 20 minutes later, crying so hard he couldn't speak. When he finally got words out, he Said, Connor, what did you do? I'm just giving it to someone who showed up. I said, Derek and Vanessa found out three months later through a LinkedIn post. I didn't even write. My lawyer made it.

Life gets busy, but now with more money, Than I'd ever imagined. I needed to know the truth. So I designed a test. I made a list of three people I'd known since college, people I'd helped, trusted, considered close. I wrote a simple script. Hey, I'm in trouble. My landlord's evicting me and I need help moving my stuff by Friday. Can you spare a few hours? That's it. No money involved, just time and effort. Thursday morning, I called Derek first. Derek and I met freshman year. We were roommates for two years. I'd covered his rent twice when he was between jobs. I'd driven him to the airport at 4:00am more times than I could count.

And now that I've been released, I will repay her for everything I went through in the same coin. I never thought my own daughter would be the one to destroy me. But here we are. Her name is Emma. And for years she'd been nothing but trouble. Lying, dealing, disappearing for days. When she turned 22, I finally had enough. You need to move out and get your life together, I told her. She packed her bags that night. And as she walked out the door, she looked me dead in the eye. You'll regret this, dad. I thought it was just another empty threat. Two weeks later, I got a call at work. The police needed me at the station immediately. When I walked in, they sat me down in a cold, gray room and told me Emma had filed a report. She claimed I've been hurting her since she was a kid. Physical abuse, years of it. My stomach dropped. That's not true, I said, my voice shaking. I never touched her, not once. But they didn't care. Emma had given them dates, fake injuries, even fake witnesses, friends of hers who agreed to lie. They arrested me right there. Handcuffs, fingerprints, a cell. My whole life fell apart in one afternoon. I spent six months in jail, waiting for trial. Six months of pure hell. My wife visited once, crying, asking if Any of it was true. The fact that she even had to ask felt like a knife in my chest. My friends stopped calling. My neighbors whispered when they saw my wife at the store. Even after I told everyone the truth, the damage was done. People always wonder, what if he really did it? My lawyer worked day and night to prove my innocence. Slowly, the truth came out. Emma's friends cracked under questioning, admitting she paid them to lie. Text messages surfaced where Emma bragged to someone about teaching dad a lesson for kicking me out. Medical records showed there were no injuries, no hospital visits, nothing to back up her claims. When the charges were finally dropped,

Grandma set up a trust for all three grandkids, college funds, first car and money for your 21st birthday. My parents handled the paperwork because grandma forgets passwords.

I walked out of that jail a broken man. But I wasn't broken enough to forget. Emma was arrested for filing a false report and conspiracy. She cried in court, saying she didn't think it would go this far, that she was sorry. The judge gave her 18 months. My wife begged me to forgive her, to let it go. She's still our daughter, she kept saying. I filed for divorce three months later. Emma served her time and got out. She tried reaching out, letters, calls, showing up at my apartment. I ignored all of it. Then one day she showed up at my door crying, dad, please, I made a mistake. I was angry and stupid. Please forgive me. I looked at her standing there and for a moment I almost felt something almost come in, I said. She looked surprised but hopeful. She sat down on my couch, wiping her tear. I've changed, dad. I swear. I just want my family back. I nodded slowly, letting her talk. She went on about therapy, about how sorry she was. She'd do anything to make it right. I let her finish. Then I pulled out my phone and played a recording. It was her voice, a conversation she'd had with a friend two weeks earlier, laughing about how she was going to play the sorry card to get money from me, how she'd milk the old man because I was stupid enough. To feel guilty. Her face went white. I hired a private investigator after you got out, I said calmly. I knew you hadn't changed. I just needed proof. I forwarded the recording to her Parole officer while she sat there frozen. You just violated your Parole by attempting to commit fraud. I said, they'll be here in about 10 minutes. She started screaming, begging, saying she didn't mean it. I just stared at her. When the police arrived, they took her away in cuffs again. As they walked her out, she looked back at me one last time, tears streaming down her face. I closed the door and sat back down on my couch. Full story on the channel linked below.

Tina Riddler, 15 years old, boarded with her father 30 minutes ago on Flight 8 7 1 to Bangkok. I at the counter, I'm her father. I'm right here. And Tina doesn't have a passport.

Within minutes, airport police and TSA supervisors crowded into the security office. They pulled up footage from an hour ago, and there she was. Tina, my 15 year old daughter, walk through security with a tall man in his 40s, both smiling, both calm. She was wearing the jacket I bought her last month. She looked happy. The security chief froze the frame on Tina's passport scan. This is a real passport, issued three months ago. I stared at the screen, my mind racing. I never applied for anything. The TSA supervisor was already on the Phone. Flight 8 7 1 is still 30 minutes from leaving US airspace. Can turn it around. My phone rang. Tina's school. Mr. Riddler, Tina's guardian, called this morning with a family emergency. He knew her student I D. Schedule, locker combination. Said he was her biological father. And you've been keeping them apart? My legs nearly gave out. The detective, who just arrived, looked at me. Has Tina been acting different? Secretive? More time online? I thought back six months. Tina glued to her phone, defensive when I asked questions, smiling at her screen in ways she never smiled at me. Constantly. But I thought it was normal teenage stuff. The detective pulled out his laptop. We need her passwords. I gave them to him. What we found made me sick. Six months of messages with dad Mike. Telling her I wasn't her real father, that he'd been searching for her, that I'd stolen her. He'd sent fake birth certificates, documents, photos. Tina had believed everything. I adopted her legally when she was two. Her biological father signed away his rights. The detective's jaw clenched.

It wasn't meant to be malicious. It was actually a security feature I designed to protect the company if something happened to me. Basically, I had to confirm my employment status every week through a secure portal, or else the system would automatically trigger a series of protocols. I'd mention this system in an email to Marcus's uncle before he retired, but clearly nobody bothered to read old emails. I calmly placed my badge and laptop on Marcus's desk. You'll want to check your emails carefully, I said quietly. Just get out, he sneered, already looking at his phone. I walked out of that building feeling weirdly calm. I went home, cracked open a beer, and waited. Two hours later, my phone exploded with calls from Marcus. I ignored the first seven. On the 8th, I answered. What did you do? He screamed. Why can no one log in? And why did they just terminate the entire company's master license? I took a slow sip of my beer. I told you to check your emails, Marcus. When you fired me, you triggered the security protocol I designed. It's all documented. The system detected I was no longer employed and automatically locked down everything to prevent unauthorized access. Fix it! He yelled. Can't! I said simply. I don't work there anymore, remember? You fired me. Badge, laptop, and dignity on your desk. The silence on the other end was Beautiful. Turns out, data core systems went completely dark for four days. No one could access anything. Not. Not the servers, not the software licenses, not even the customer database. They lost three major clients and over $2 million. Marcus tried hiring the outsourced IT company to fix it, but they couldn't crack my encryption. Eventually, the board of directors called me, apologized profusely, and offered me triple my old salary plus equity to come back and fix everything. I made them fire Marcus first. Now I'm the I T. Director with actual authority. And I've never been happier.

Sierra never appealed. Eli's 5 now and calls us mom and dad.

Mom, you're confused. Grandma stood. I may forget my reading glasses, but I do not forget theft. I pushed my chair back. I'm done. I'm not signing anything. I'm not handing over tips. I'm not cosigning. I'm not covering gas. If you need money, get a job. If you need help, ask honestly and accept. No! Mom started crying. How can you be so cruel? I picked up my folder, kissed Grandma's cheek. Love you. I love you, too. Caleb walked out that night. 22 missed calls by midnight. Mom, at 3:00am. You broke your father's heart. Dad, at 6:00am. Answer your phone, boy. Mason, bro, you made it weird. I muted them all. By the next afternoon, grandma had frozen my parents trust access, pushed for an audit, and set up an account with only my name. I moved out within a Month found a room above a nail salon. I said no to covering Mason's catering gig. I said no to Ivy's Midnight Furniture moving. Mom called from a different number. Your grandmother is turning you against us. No. You did that. We just needed help. Ask for help. Don't take it. Mason Dm'd me. Loan me 3K. Quick turnaround. I typed no. 12 messages, came back selfish. You changed. I set my phone to only allow grandma's calls. Mom emailed a family meeting proposal with bullet points in the middle. Caleb will apologize for overreacting. I deleted it. I'm 22 now. I pay my own rent. I answer grandma's calls on the first ring. When I see my parents at the store, we say hi like neighbors. Mason still asks for favors. I still say no. They never apologized? Not really. Just. We were under stress, and you know how your father is. I keep the $50 from my 21st birthday in my wallet. Not as a wound, as a receipt. It reminds me what I used to accept and what I don't anymore.

Ten minutes later, I paused the shared payments I've been covering. They were laughing in the chat, but they didn't expect what happened next. I was backstage at the theater, face still caked in makeup, eating a banana under a flickering light, when my phone buzzed. Dad, stay away from the wedding. Bianca. Seriously, Leo, it's adults only. The whole family is tired of you and your kids. I stared at the screen. The curtain rustled. The stage smelled like dust and hairspray. I typed one line, then I'll stop funding the marriage.

I shoved the phone in my pocket and walked into the light. That night after the show, the apartment was dark except for the glow of the fish tank. Mara was eating cold pasta and her scrubs. They said, no kids, I told her. She didn't flinch. Of. Of course they did. Our triplets were asleep, arms tangled. I looked at them and thought, chaos never looked this pure. Mara reached over. You're allowed to be done, she said. My family always treated me like a utility. Bianca, the golden one. Me, the handyman with a credit card. 2,018. Leo Can you add us to your phone plan? You get a union discount. Two, 2000 and nineteen. Can you spot us $400 for rent? 2,020. We need a deposit for the venue. Just until RSVPs come in. 2,021. Cakes are expensive. Call it your gift. Every favor became permanent. Every temporary charge. Eternal love, they said. Family, they said. Family feels different when you're the only one paying for it. The rehearsal dinner invite said earth tones. Adults only. We showed up in brown clothes like obedient extras. Mom hugged me like I'd already apologized. Dad shook my hand like it was a transaction. Bianca, air kiss near my cheek. Marco whispered, try not to ruin the vibe, bro. Then Bianca clinked her glass. Before we eat, she said, thank you to everyone who helped. My cousin Danny for the playlist, my parents for everything. And Leo for mcing the reception. He's got that.

The expired Epipens are still in my backpack. I've been carrying around medication that might not work, but every time I bring it up, mom says, we'll handle it next month. She bought Kendra a one hundred dollar lactose intolerance testing kit on Amazon the same day. My dad just goes along with whatever mom says. He calls me Tough Cookie and Kendra Princess, if that tells you anything about our family dynamic. This one night we went to mom's favorite Thai place for her birthday. I told the waiter about my allergy, showed him my card, and asked twice about the pad Thai. He assured me, no nuts. Twenty minutes after eating, my throat started itching, then tightening. I grabbed my mom's arm and said, hospital, now! The expired Epipen didn't work properly. Obviously the injection was weak. It barely even helped. Dad drove the car while I sat in the back gasping for help. Mom kept saying, breathe normally like I was choosing to wheeze. Five minutes from the hospital, Kendra started whining that she wanted her pink drink from Starbucks. Mom actually turned around to look at her and said, oh, sweetie, we'll get you one after. Like, your other daughter is literally dying, mom. Kendra heard no and started crying. Not little tears, but that manipulative wailing she does. I want it now. My tummy hurts from dinner. Dad looked at mom. Mom looked at me, gasping in the back backseat, my face swelling. Then Looked at Kendra. There's one right there, mom said, pointing at the Starbucks ahead. It'll just take a second. I couldn't even form words to argue. My throat was closing. Dad pulled into the drive through. Welcome to Starbucks. What can I? One grande pink drink, extra ice, mom said calmly, while I made choking sounds in the back. And a cake pop, Kendra added. They were out of pink drink, so they had to make it fresh. It took seven minutes. Seven minutes in that drive through while my airway closed. I passed out. Two blocks from the hospital, the E R. Doctor asked why it took so long to get me there. The Starbucks receipt with the time stamp was still on the dashboard. He reported them to C P S. That night.

Cranberry cocktail. Cold, sticky. It's splashed across my cream silk dress, soaking through like blood. My niece Sophia grinned across the table. Now you look as cheap as you really are. 17, pretty poisonous. My mother laughed softly. Teenagers, she said, patting her hand around us. The restaurant went silent. The flicker of candles, the soft hum of violins. My $3,000 birthday dress ruined in front of everyone. I just smiled. But something inside me snapped clean into. The rest of the night passed in a blur. My friends tried to help. My mother made excuses. My sister Vanessa called it a little joke. I dabbed at the silk with a napkin until the stains bled deeper. When they finally left, I walked home through the cold Chicago air, the smell of cranberry following me like a curse. At 2 a m, I opened my banking app. Five years of help stared back at me. $78,000 in transfers, credit card charges for purses, spas, and vacations. I never took the car I bought for Sophia, the insurance, the gas money. And then her social media post. A photo of me dress Ruined caption when Rich Auntie needs to be taken down a peg. Number sorry. Not sorry. Dozens of laughing emojis, one of them from my sister. That was the moment I stopped being their safety net and started being their consequence. By morning, I was calm. Cold. I called my credit card company. First, I need to remove an authorized user. Click. Done. Then my lawyer. The car is in your name. He confirmed. You can take it back anytime. I called a towing service, gave them the make, model, and address. Be discreet, I told them. Finally, I brewed coffee and waited. At 7:53 a m, my phone rang. My car is gone! Sophia shrieked. Someone stole it from school. It wasn't your car, I said evenly. It was mine. You can't do that. I already did. You're ruining my life! I gave you a car. You gave me humiliation. I'd call it even. Click came Vanessa screaming. You canceled my card! I needed gas, rent, groceries. I needed respect, I said. Guess we both Learned something. She cursed until I hung up. Then my mother called.

Ethan just nodded and followed them to the patrol car. The hazmat team emerged 40 minutes later carrying sealed containers. Whatever was in that locker required professionals and protective suits. Students whispered rumors. Someone said bomb. Another swore they'd seen Ethan watching explosive tutorials. Then one of the hazmat technicians pulled off his mask and started laughing, actually laughing. Called Principal Davidson over and showed him something on his phone. Davidson's expression changed from concern to confusion to something I couldn't read. They called Ethan over. He showed them screens of photos and data. Nobody was handcuffing anybody. Davidson walked back to the teachers, face red. We're calling Ethan's parents and the school board. The building is safe. The situation is not what we thought. An hour later, we were in the cafeteria. Ethan sat at the front with his parents and Davidson. His mom kept her arm around his shoulders. His dad looked angry, but not at Ethan, at us. Davidson cleared his throat. I owe Ethan an apology. What he was keeping in his locker was not drugs or weapons. It was a water testing and filtration system. He's been collecting samples from the school's drinking fountains for three weeks. As he got sick and suspected contamination, the cafeteria went silent. Ethan's dad stood up. My son found lead in your water, levels high enough to cause serious health problems. He's been documenting it, testing different fountains, trying to figure out which pipes Were the problem before bringing it to anyone because he didn't think anyone would believe him. I felt my stomach drop. The chemicals were testing reagents. The glass containers were sample collection. The smell was from the purification process. He wasn't building something dangerous. He was trying to prove the school was poisoning us. The cap chemicals that scared everyone are from at home water testing kits. Ethan's mom added quietly. He bought them with birthday money. He's been getting up at 5 a. M. To collect samples before school. He didn't want anyone to know because he wanted to be absolutely sure first. Davidson continued pendent testers are coming today, but Ethan's results show dangerous lead levels in at least six fountains. The state health department has been notified. Someone asked why he didn't just tell an adult. Ethan finally spoke, barely audible. I pride. I told the nurse I was worried after I got sick. She said I probably just had the flu. I told my science teacher about rust in the fountain. He said old buildings have old pipes and not to worry. No one listens to me. The school closed for two weeks while they replace pipes. Ethan's testing had been accurate. Lead levels were three times the safe limit. Six other students came forward saying they've been sick too. The district faced a lawsuit. Ethan was interviewed by the local news.

I stood, grabbed my jacket, and left. That night, I canceled Tyler's rent payment. Three years of support gone with one click. A week later, Tyler called, not to apologize, to ask where his money was. I told him it stopped the night. He called me a failure. He hung up, cursing. Two weeks later, mom called crying, said I was being cruel. I reminded her what he said. She said I was too sensitive. I hung up and blocked her. Tyler got evicted, moved back with our parents, posted on Facebook about toxic family who abandon you. I ignored it all. Six months later, a wedding invitation arrived. Tyler was getting married. I almost tossed it, but curiosity won. IRSVP. Yes. The wedding was expensive. Way too expensive for Tyler. Our parents must have drained their savings. I showed up in a sharp suit, found my seat at table 12 in the back, behind a column. My place card said Alan. Perfect. The reception. Tyler grabbed the mic. I want to thank everyone who believed in me. My parents for their love, and even my brother Alex, who taught me about hard work, even if we don't always agree. Polite applause. He shot me a smug look. He wasn't thanking me. He was rewriting history. I stood up, walked to the AV booth, handed the tech a USB drive. Updated slideshow from the groom. He plugged it in. The screen changed from wedding photos to bank statements. Every Payment I'd sent Tyler. Dates, amounts. Three years total. $38,000. Then screenshots. Tyler begging for money, promising to pay me back over and over. Finally, one last slide. Still single, huh? Must be lonely being a failure. Tyler to the brother who kept him housed. The room went silent. Then gasps. Tyler's face went gray to red. He stood up, mouth open. I raised my glass from the back. Congratulations on your wedding. And congratulations on finally having someone else to mooch off of. His father in law leaned over and whispered something sharp to Tyler. Tyler's wife looked between the screen and him, confusion turning to anger. Mom rushed toward me. How could you ruin his wedding? I didn't ruin anything, I said calmly. I just showed everyone who he really is. I set down my glass, walked out, and never looked back. Three days later, I got a text from Tyler's wife. Thank you. Filing for an annulment. He lied about everything. I didn't respond. Just deleted it.

I never told anyone, just sent the money every month. This dinner was Mom's idea for family time. The invite came loaded with guilt. I almost said no. I had a big presentation that week, but guilt 1. So I showed up. Dinner started normally small, talk about work, weather, Mom's book club. Dad asked about my job, then cut me off to ask Tyler about some startup pitch. Tyler launched into an elaborate story about almost getting funded. Pure fiction. Mom made it up. I was halfway through my pasta when it Happened. Tyler leaned back, swirling his wine and smirked. Still single, huh, he said. Must be lonely being a failure. He laughed. Mom giggled. Dad chuckled. I froze for a second. I just stared at him, wondering what kind of person says that to someone who's been paying their bills. Something inside me broke. I set down my fork and looked Tyler in the eye. Funny coming from a guy whose rent I've paid for three years. Not anymore, by the way. Tyler's smirk vanished. Mom's mouth fell open. Dad's wine glass hit the table. Alex. Mom gasped. Why would you embarrass him? I looked at her calmly. Done, Tyler stammered. I don't know what he's talking about. I have every bank transfer if you'd like to see them. Dad cleared his throat. We don't air family business at dinner, right? When Tyler insults me, it's jokes. When I state facts, it's inappropriate.

I first noticed the smell on a Monday morning when I walked past locker 2:47. It was faint, almost like cleaning chemicals mixed with something metallic. Ethan, who owned that locker, was this 14 year old who barely spoke to anyone and always wore the same oversized hoodie. The smell was weird, but our school was old, and weird smells happened all the time. Tuesday, the smell got stronger. I watched Ethan arrive early, looking around nervously before opening his locker just wide enough to shove something inside. He closed it quickly, but not before I caught a glimpse of clear plastic tubing. When I walked past later, the chemical smell was unmistakable. First thought was drugs. But Ethan, the kid who ate lunch alone reading science fiction novels. Wednesday brought more concerning signs. Ethan arrived with a cardboard box he struggled to carry. He waited until the hallway was empty, then transferred contents into his locker piece by piece. I saw glass containers, lots of them. The kind you'd see in a chemistry lab. My stomach started churning because this was looking less like a weird hobby and more like a genuine safety concern. Thursday morning, another teacher was standing near locker 2:47, fanning the air. Something died in there, she said. The smell had evolved into something acrid that made your eyes water. Ethan's face went pale when he saw us. Standing there, he mumbled something about a science project and wouldn't make eye contact. Other students started holding their shirts over their noses when they walked past. Friday, I made my first mistake. I should have reported it then, but I watched Ethan during lunch, sitting alone, constantly checking his phone like he was monitoring something important. When the final bell rang, he ran to his locker, opened it slightly to check something inside, then quickly locked it and left. Monday morning, I found wet patches on the floor near locker 2:47. Not water, something thicker that smelled like vinegar and battery acid. I went straight to Principal Davidson and told him everything. His face went serious when I mentioned chemicals and glass containers. Show me, he said. Grabbing his master keys, we walked to locker 2:47 together. Davidson inserted his key, and I heard him mutter Jesus Christ before quickly slamming it shut. Evacuate the building now! Fire alarm! Get everyone out! Within 20 minutes, we had 800 students in the parking lot. While police cars and a hazmat truck pulled up. Ethan stood apart from everyone. Hoodie pulled up, staring at the ground. Two officers approached him. Son, we need to talk.

But her dad kept calling to check on me every week. Sometimes twice. How are the treatments going? Do you need anything? I'm sorry about my daughter. I thought he was just being polite. Guilty about Eva walking out. Eva filed for divorce three months later. Through a lawyer. Didn't even have the guts to Tell me herself. She wanted half of everything, including my retirement account. The same one I'd been draining to pay for the fertility treatments she'd abandoned me during. The irony wasn't lost on the judge. Her dad showed up to one of my court dates at in the back row. Didn't say a word to anyone. Eva saw him there and smiled like she'd already won. Like daddy was going to swoop in and save her. He just stared at her with this look I couldn't quite read. After the divorce finalized, he called me. I want you to know I don't approve of what she did. He said you deserved better. We started meeting for coffee once a month. He'd ask about my life, my work, whether I was dating anyone. Never once asked about. About Eva. Four years passed.

My mom got in the cast members face. No, absolutely not. Check the back. There has to be more. The cast member kept apologizing and my sister started crying. The family in front of us was walking away with their kid holding the bucket above his head. My sister took off running and my mom went right after her. My sister tried to grab the bucket from the kid's hands. The dad pulled his son away and my sister was screaming, you don't even care about pigment. You're just gonna throw that away in a week. My mom shoved the dad so hard he stumbled backwards. Then she lunged at the kid and grabbed the bucket. The kids started wailing. The other mom tried to grab it back and my mom yanked it away so hard the handle broke. My sister dropped to her knees sobbing, no, you broke it. And she looked up at me with your hatred. This is all your fault. If you had run when I told you to, we would have been ahead of them. Disney security showed up and escorted us past hundreds of people who were recording and staring. My sister was crying so hard she could barely walk. And my mom Was arguing with security the entire time. We got taken to some office where a supervisor explained that we were banned from all Disney properties. My mom tried to argue that my sister has a medical condition. My daughter needs this popcorn bucket for her mental health. My dad was sitting in the corner with his head in his hands. My sister was on her phone looking up resale prices for the bucket and crying harder every time she refreshed. The supervisor said we needed to leave immediately and that if we tried to come back, we'd be arrested for trespassing. They walked us out through a back exit. We had dinner reservations that night that cost $400 and we missed it because we spent three hours getting banned from Disney World. We drove back to the hotel in complete silence except for my sister sobbing in the back seat. My mom kept saying that family is going to sell that bucket for hundreds of dollars. That's why they wanted it so badly. I checked my phone and my sister had posted a five paragraph rant about Disney discriminating against adults and how I ruined her life by not caring about her passion. My mom had already commented, so proud of you for standing up for yourself, baby girl.

You are not going to itemize parenting to the child you stole from. Mason threw up his hands. It's money, okay? We used it for the family. I stared at him. I'm the family. He looked away. Grandma folded her hands. Transfer the full $10,000 to Caleb today. Remove your names from any accounts with his. Stop using him as a cosigner or piggy bank. Mom's voice turned sweet. Mom, you're confused. Grandma stood. I may forget my reading glasses, but I do not forget theft. I pushed my chair back. I'm done. I'm not signing anything. I'm not handing over tips. I'm not cosigning. I'm not covering gas. If you need money, get a job. If you need help, ask honestly and accept. No. Mom started crying. How can you be so cruel?

When I see my parents at the store, we say hi like neighbors. Mason still asks for favors. I still say no. They never apologized. Not really.

My sister has been obsessed with Disney since we were kids, but it got really bad after college. She's 24 now and has an annual pass even though we live in Ohio, which means my parents fund her monthly trips to Florida. Her room looked like a Disney store exploded in it. She has hundreds of collector pins covering every surface and a shrine to pigment the dragon in the corner. She even tracks limited edition merchandise on a spreadsheet. My parents pay for everything because she claimed she was building a business selling Disney content, but her Instagram only had 200 followers. I wanted nothing to do with this weird Disney worship, but my mom somehow guilt tripped me and to going on a family trip with them. The trip was a nightmare from day one. My sister had a full itinerary planned down to the minute, including which bathrooms we were allowed to use. She cried twice before lunch on the first day because a character meet and greet line was too long. My parents just kept apologizing to her and buying her stuff to calm her down. By day three I was looking at flights home. That's when my sister burst into my room at 6:00am. The segment bucket drops tomorrow, she said like she was announcing someone died. She made us sit through a 45 Minute presentation about how we were going to obtain the bucket. My mom was taking notes, and my dad asked if we needed walkie talkies. When I said, it's just a popcorn bucket, my sister's face went red. You don't get me. You never have. My mom squeezed my arm. Please just support her. The next morning, we got to Epcot two hours before it opened. When the gates opened, everyone started power walking toward the store. My sister was practically running, and my parents were right behind her. I was walking at a normal pace because, as I don't run for anyone. When we got in line at the store, it was already wrapped around the building. My sister was on her phone, refreshing five different Disney Facebook groups and doing breathing exercises. My mom was next to her, saying, you're doing so good, baby. We're almost there. When we finally got close to the front, a cast member came out and started counting heads.

When she took her bow, I stood up and cheered alone. After the show, kids swarmed into the lobby, families hugging, taking photos, handing out flowers. Rosie walked over to me holding her paper pig ears. Her eyes were scanning the crowd. Did they get lost? She asked quietly. I checked my phone. Group chat, silent since Tuesday. I opened Instagram, Lauren's story from two hours ago. Mimosas at a table by a window. Sunday, fun day with my people. Except it was Thursday. My mother was in the background laughing with a drink in her hand. Dylan's arm visible in the corner holding a beer. I knelt down and hugged Rosie. I don't know, baby. She nodded, didn't cry, just said, can we get ice cream? We got ice cream. I didn't text them. I didn't call. I waited. Six days later, my phone lit up. Lauren's baby shower invite, pink glitter borders, Venmo required 100 dollar minimum for the group. Gift registry links, a note at the bottom, let's spoil this little one. I stared at it, scrolled up to see if I'd missed anything. Oh, sorry. Oh, we got the date wrong. Even a, how was the play? Nothing. I put Rosie to bed and sat in my kitchen with my laptop, opened a document and started typing a list of every time I'd shown up for them, every birthday I drove two hours for, every hospital visit, every time they Needed money and I had none but gave it anyway. Then I went to the dollar store, bought a card with a generic baby on it, store pastel colors, lank. Inside I wrote in neat tiny letters, congrats on teaching me. Who's family taped a $1 Bill to the inside with scotch tape, nailed it. Then I opened my phone and started blocking one by one. Mom, Lauren, Dylan, aunts, cousins who'd been in that group chat and said nothing. Twelve numbers total. My phone felt lighter. Three days of silence. Then it rang. Unknown number. I almost didn't answer. Hello? My mom's voice shaky. Then why didn't you come? I frowned. Come where? To my surgery. I had my gallbladder out this morning. I asked everyone to come sit with me. No one showed up. I stood in my kitchen, hand gripping the counter, not even a text. She continued, I woke up alone. I didn't say anything. Iris, are you there? Yeah, I said. Well, Rosie had a play, I said. Silence. You didn't come to that either. I hung up. Rosie walked into the kitchen. Was that grandma? Yeah. Is she okay? I looked at my daughter, at her pig ears still sitting on the counter. She'll figure it out, I said.

I pulled one out and my back spazzed. I was done. She came into the kitchen and started making herself toast. I turned around and said if she couldn't stop rearranging my kitchen, she could get a hotel room. She froze. Then she started going on about how she was just trying to make things make more sense and how this was her son's home, too. And it was just a little reorganization. And we shouldn't all suffer just because I'm tall. Then she said I was heartless for expecting her to stay in a hotel during the holidays. My husband came in because he heard her voice getting louder. He looked uncomfortable, but he backed me up. He told her this was my home, too, and if she wouldn't respect that, she'd have to leave.

Sent a reminder after four days. Still nothing from those three. Then I sent another reminder after a week. Jordan finally responded with, oh yeah, I forgot, but still didn't send money. Felix said he was broke, but I literally saw him post about buying concert tickets that same morning. Megan just left me on read. Two weeks before Tyler's birthday, I told the group chat we were doing a dinner at this nice steakhouse downtown. Made a reservation for six people. Austin noticed right away and asked why I only booked six seats when there's eight of us. I replied, reserved it for everyone who contributed to the gift. The chat Went completely silent for like 10 minutes, then Jordan started typing. He said I was being petty and that it's just a birthday dinner. Everyone should be invited regardless. I said the people who cared enough to actually help buy the gift are the ones who get to celebrate with him at dinner. Simple as that. Felix jumped in saying I was creating drama over nothing and that he'd pay his share right now. I told him too late. Reservation is already set and I'm not changing it. Megan said I was being a terrible friend and that Tyler wouldn't want this kind of energy at his birthday.

The five of us who paid went ahead and ordered the laptop. It arrived six days before his actual birthday. We wrapped it up nice with this blue metallic paper and stuck it in Austin's closet since he lives closest to the restaurant. Birthday night came around. We, we all met up at the steakhouse at 7. The hostess took us to this corner booth that fits six people perfectly. We ordered appetizers and we're just hanging out when my phone started blowing up. Jordan was texting me asking where we were. I didn't respond. Then Felix called me twice, ignored both calls. Megan sent a long paragraph about how I excluded them on purpose and how messed up that was. Tyler showed up 20 minutes later looking confused. He asked where Jordan, Felix and Megan were. I handed him a card that all five of us signed. Inside the card, I wrote from the friends who actually showed up when it mattered. He read it, looked at me and I could tell he knew exactly what happened. We ate dinner and it was honestly perfect. Takes were incredible. We got this chocolate lava cake for dessert. And when we gave Tyler the laptop, he literally just stared at the box for a solid minute before opening it. His hands were shaking when he pulled it out. He'd been saving Up for months but kept having to use that money for car repairs and other bills. After dinner, Tyler posted a photo on his Instagram of him holding the laptop with all 5 of us in the background. He captioned it, real ones know who shows up. Within an hour, Jordan, Felix and Megan all unfollowed him. Jordan sent me one last text saying, hope you're happy with your little click. I blocked his number. Next day at work, my coworker Rachel if I was the one who didn't invite some friends to a birthday thing because her roommate apparently knows Megan. She said Megan was telling everyone I was toxic and controlling. I showed Rachel the group chat screenshots with all the payment reminders and the dates, just laughed and said Megan was reaching hard. The following weekend, Tyler invited just the five of us over to his apartment for a game night. We ordered pizza, played on his new laptop, and he kept saying thank you like every 30 minutes. One point he said this was the first birthday in years where he actually felt like people cared. Two months later, Felix tried to join us when we were all at a bar for Kevin's birthday. He walked up like nothing happened and tried to order a drink next to us. Tyler looked at him and said, this table's full. Felix stood there for a second then left without saying anything. Haven't seen any of those three Since

I'll bring flowers. My sister Lauren texted back with three heart emojis and Omg, can't wait. My brother Dylan said he'd recorded on his good camera. I felt something lift in my chest. Maybe this time would be different. The week before I confirmed so good for Thursday. I asked in the chat, mom, of course, Lauren, yeah, Dylan, thumbs up emoji. Show night. I got there early and saved them. Front row seats, four chairs in. The center. I draped my jacket over one, Rosie's backpack over another, my purse across two. The auditorium filled up fast. Parents with camcorders, grandparents with flowers, siblings squirming in their seats. Six twenty five PM, I checked my phone, nothing. Six thirty PM, lights dimmed. I pulled my stuff off the seats. A mom with a toddler asked if they were taken. I hesitated, then shook my head. She sat down. Rosie peeked through the curtain before the show started, scanning the crowd. I waved, gave her a big thumbs up. She didn't smile back, just ducked behind the curtain again. The play started. Rosie delivered her lines perfectly. I clapped so loud my hands stung. I.

I called my best friends pretending I was drowning in debt. One told me it was karma. Another said you're not my problem. But my childhood friend drove four hours to help me move my stuff. What I did next changed his entire future. My name is Connor. I'm 31 and I just sold my cyber security software to a Fortune 500 company for $90 Million after taxes. I built it alone in my garage. For three years nights I worked at a data center making $19 an hour. Days I coded until my eyes burned. No investors, no press, just me, caffeine and a dream that felt impossible. Most mornings the wire hit my account. On a Tuesday at two forty seven PM I was sitting in a Wendy's parking lot eating a $5 meal when my phone buzzed. I read the number three times and I put my head on the steering wheel and just breathed. I didn't call my mom, didn't post online, didn't tell anyone because I realized something sitting there with my cold fries. I had no idea who actually cared about me versus who cared about what I could do for them. For three years, I've been the broke friend, the one who couldn't make bachelor parties or split Airbnb's. People stopped inviting me to things. I told myself it was normal. Life gets busy, but now with more money, Than I'd ever imagined, I needed to know the truth. So I designed a test. I made a list of three people I'd known since college, people I'd helped, trusted, considered close. I wrote a simple script. Hey, I'm in trouble. My landlord's evicting me, and I need help moving my stuff by Friday. Can you spare a few hours?

So don't bother calling. I'm cutting contact till I'm back. I didn't argue. But when her flight landed and she looked around expecting to see me, she realised who actually showed up instead. I'm a private investigator. It's a job that changes you. You learn to read people not by what they say, but by what they hide. My girlfriend of three years, Jessica, always said my job made me too cynical. Turns out I wasn't cynical enough. We've been together since college. Lived in my house, the one I bought after a decade of long nights and risky cases. We had shared goals, shared accounts, a shared life. I trusted her completely. Then came the Vegas trip with her three friends. Lauren, the twice divorced ring leader. Becca, the follower who posted everything online, and Chloe, the quiet calculator. A few days before she left, I asked for her flight details, just in case of emergency. She turned to me with this hard look I'd never seen before. You don't need to know that. What do you mean? I just want to know where you are. The whole point is to get away from everything, including you. You don't need to know what happens there. That's why you're blocked until I'm home. Blocked? Not just asking for privacy, declaring a five day blackout. I didn't react, didn't argue. In my profession, when someone shows you a wall, you Don't try to break it down. You find a way around it. Okay, I said calmly. Have a great time. Her defiant expression faltered. She wanted to fight. My easy agreement left her with nothing to push against. The next morning, I drove her to the airport. She was cheerful, excited, already mentally gone. As she got out, she leaned in to kiss me. Don't miss me too much. I'll call when I land to let you know I'm unblocking you. She laughed, thinking I was joking. I watched her disappear into the terminal. Then I drove straight to my office. Boyfriend was gone. The investigator had clocked in. First thing I did was run the plate on the S U V. That picked up her friends. Came back registered to Adam Cole, senior partner at a major investment firm. Also married with two kids. Jessica said they were flying budget airline. Flight manifests told a different story.

Rosie walked over to me holding her paper pig ears. Her eyes were scanning the crowd. Did they get lost? She asked quietly. I checked my phone. Group chat, silent since Tuesday. I opened Instagram, Lauren's story from two hours ago. Mimosas at a table by a window. Sunday, fun day with my people. Except it was Thursday. My mother was in the background laughing with a drink in her hand. Dylan's arm visible in the corner holding a beer. I knelt down and hugged Rosie. I don't know, baby. She nodded, didn't cry, just said, can we get ice cream? We got ice cream. I didn't text them. I didn't call. I waited. Six days later, my phone lit up. Lauren's baby shower invite, pink glitter borders, Venmo required 100 dollar minimum for the group. Gift registry links, a note at the bottom, let's spoil this little one. I stared at it, scrolled up to see if I'd missed anything. Oh, sorry. Oh, we got the date wrong. Even a, how was the play? Nothing. I put Rosie to bed and sat in my kitchen with my laptop, opened a document and started typing a list of every time I'd shown up for them, every birthday I drove two hours for, every hospital visit, every time they needed money and I had none but gave it anyway. Then I went to the dollar store, bought a card with a generic Baby on it, store pastel colors, blank. Inside, I wrote in neat tiny letters, congrats on teaching me. Who's family taped a $1 Bill to the inside with scotch tape, nailed it. Then I opened my phone and started blocking one by one. Mom, Lauren, Dylan, aunts, cousins who'd been in that group chat and said nothing. Twelve numbers total. My phone felt lighter. Three days of silence. Then it rang. Unknown number. I almost didn't answer. Hello? My mom's voice shaky. Then why didn't you come? I frowned. Come where? To my surgery. I had my gallbladder out this morning. I asked everyone to come sit with me. No one showed up. I stood in my kitchen, hand gripping the counter, not even a text. She continued. I woke up alone. I didn't say anything. Iris, are you there? Yeah, I said. Well, Rosie had a play, I said. Silence. You didn't come to that either. I hung up. Rosie walked into the kitchen. Was that grandma? Yeah. Is she okay? I looked at my daughter, at her pig ears still sitting on the counter. She'll figure it out, I said.

I found out later he tried to order catering from four different places. Everything was booked. He drove to Boston Market at noon. They had a Two hour wait. He bought six rotisserie chickens from the grocery store, instant mashed potatoes, canned cranberry sauce and store bought pies. His mother showed up at two PM expecting the dining room set with China and a Martha Stewart spread. She found him in his boxers and a T-shirt, still trying to figure out how to heat everything. At the same time the house was a disaster. He'd forgotten to clean anything. He called me and left a voicemail about how disappointed she was. I listened to it while getting a pedicure. I came home Sunday night refreshed and relaxed. He was sitting in the kitchen surrounded by takeout containers. He looked at me and said, I had no idea. I said, now you do.

Her husband works for a tech firm. His boss, my golf buddy, he heard about the situation from a mutual friend and calls me directly to apologize, then tells me her husband's getting demoted.

Got evicted from their actual apartment. They moved in with the husband's parents. Her husband got demoted. Like I said, his reputation at work completely tanked. Nobody trust him. My sister tried apologizing, sent me this long email about how she always envied my success, how she thought if she just lived in my house, she'd feel successful too. Golden child syndrome, except in reverse. She said she's in therapy now, learning about boundaries. I didn't respond. I found Apollo 3 weeks later. Neighbour 4 streets over had been feeding her. She's home now, traumatized but home. Never letting my sister near anything I love again.

Except when bills needed covering, when Melanie's car needed brakes, when Aaron needed rent. Just this once. Then I was the backbone. But on Mother's Day, I was the joke. Something shifted. Something final. I pulled out a black box and placed it in front of her. Happy Mother's Day. She blinked. Just what is this? You'll see. I stood and walked out. Ten minutes later, I was in her driveway. I opened the luxury car I'd gifted her last year, the one she bragged about. I had the second key. I got in, start, started the engine, and drove away slowly. She screamed when she opened the box. Inside was a single photo. Me, 10 years old, holding a homemade Mother's Day card and flowers. I Bought with coins I saved from skipping lunch for a week on the back. This was the last time I thought I mattered to you. For two weeks, silence. Then Greg messaged. That car situation really messed her up. Maybe apologize. I didn't answer. Three days later, Dad's voicemail. If you're done acting like an attention seeker, we could use help with Aaron's tuition. I told myself I was done. But then Grandma's 83rd birthday. The only person who looked at me without judgment. I went to get ice. That's when I heard them in the kitchen. Melanie, he's not family. He's just a wallet with feelings. After Greg, feelings don't pay rent, mom. I wish he'd Learned to take a joke. He always makes it about him. Dad, he did it to feel important. Let him feel small for once. I stood there, not moving. When I walked in. Silence. They didn't try to hide it. One week later, my bank alerted me. Someone attempted a transfer from an old joint account with dad

My roommate Ben was chill until I realized he'd steal my food and lie about it. Whenever I bought eggs, he'd use six to make high protein meals. I couldn't leave leftover food in the fridge or else it'd be gone in 10 minutes. Then he'd have the audacity to lie every time, brag about eating the food, or even gaslighting us saying we ate it in our sleep. We were sick of it. More and more food started to disappear. Every time I go to the grocery store, I would only end up with half before the day was out. Food ghosted us. The package of noodles I bought to make my girlfriend spaghetti. Gone. Ben, where's the noodles? I asked him. Olivia ate them. I knew better. Olivia hated spaghetti noodles. Olivia's food started to disappear too. Ben, stop! Stop grabbing my chips! Olivia said when she caught him red handed. Ben just smirked. I thought you said I could. It pissed her off. It pissed me off. Hey, thanks for the sandwich. Henry. Ben grinned while eating the sub sandwich I just brought home for lunch. Not cool, man. Stop being a jerk. I'm angry. Every day something new. Yo, Olivia, great job on those brownies. Ben clapped her on the shoulder, getting brownie crumbs all over the kitchen floor. Henry, did you see where I put those sugar cookies? Olivia asked me. One more morning. No, I haven't touched them. They were awesome. Homemade? Ben asked, putting the plate that held them into the sink. Olivia looked like she wanted to punch him. She almost did. It got so bad we couldn't even eat at home. You're a pain. I told Ben in anger. I think you're too stressed. Ben retarded. He truly didn't see the issue. So, Ben, when are you going to pay me for that grocery shopping trip I did yesterday? Olivia asked him. We never agreed to that. Ben just waves her off. I think you guys just forget you eat. Ben smirks. He's off, man. No way we're forgetting our own food. I say, annoyed. I'd get that checked out. I think you two have memory problems. He calls on the way out. Olivia and I just sit in fury. He's such a jerk. Olivia spits. I second that. We've got to do something. I mutter. We need to stage an intervention tonight. Later

So I'm 6 foot 6, my husband is 5 7. When we got married three years ago, we had to figure out how our kitchen would work because his whole family is short and I'm basically a giant. We tried it their way for like two weeks, where everything was at normal height and I was crouching constantly to grab plates and pans. My back was killing me. So we moved everything up higher and got him a step stool. Problem solved. He didn't care, I wasn't in pain anymore, and we moved on with our lives. Then my mother in law's roof started leaking two weeks ago. Big leak, needs serious repairs, and she needed a place to stay. My husband and I have a spare bedroom. His sister, who's also my best friend, lives in a one bedroom apartment, so obviously she came to stay with us. Day one, I noticed my spice rack was lower. I didn't say anything because maybe I moved it and forgot. Day two, the plates were on a lower shelf. I asked my husband if he moved them and he said no. Day 3, I watched her move my drinking glasses down while I was getting the mail. I came back inside and she was putting them in a cabinet that was basically at her chest level. For me, that's knee level. I asked Her why? She moved them. And she said it was ridiculous to keep things so high up when guests might need them. I told her we don't really have guests and that I need things where they are. She did this little laugh and said she just been trying to help make the kitchen make more sense. My husband talked to her that night. He told her to stop moving stuff around. She cried a little and said she felt like we were being unwelcoming. He said that wasn't it, but the kitchen was set up for us and she needed to leave it alone. She agreed. Next morning, the mugs were moved. I opened the cabinet where we keep them and they weren't there. I checked three other cabinets before I found them. In the cabinet under the counter. The one where we used to keep pots before we moved those up, too. I had to get on my knees on the kitchen floor to pull out a mug. My back hurt immediately, that sharp pain you get when you bend wrong. I made my coffee.

I freeze. I immediately open my security camera app and lose it. My sister is redecorating my living room. She's got her husband mounting a t. V on my wall. Her three kids are running around in the background. There's boxes everywhere. I watch the footage from the past two days. They've been moving in this whole time. Then I check her Instagram because I'm spiraling. She posted, yes, photo of her in my living room. Caption reads, new chapter in our forever home. God provides forever home, my house.

He took my car keys, my laptop, and changed the Wi-Fi password. I called my mom at work. She said we talked about it when she got home that night. I asked her why she lets him do this. He just said, he pays the bills, Leah. We need to keep the peace. I went to my room, didn't come out for dinner. Wednesday morning, rich was at the kitchen table when I came down. Your mother told me you're upset. I poured coffee and didn't answer. I provide for this family. You live under my roof, my rules. My mom was doing dishes. Her back to both of us.

Friday, I was supposed to meet my boyfriend at the library. Rich said I wasn't going anywhere until I apologize for being disrespectful. I asked what I did. He said my tone was wrong. My mom was folding laundry. In the next room, I waited for her to say something. Nothing. Saturday morning, the mail came. The envelope from state university. I grabbed it before anyone else could, went to my room and locked the door. Full academic scholarship. Housing included. Meal plan covered everything. I sat on my bed staring at the letter for maybe twenty minutes. Then I heard Rich's voice downstairs. Leah, get down here! I went down with a letter in my hand. My mom was sitting on the couch. Rich was standing. Your mother says you got mail from some college. I handed him the letter. He read it, then looked at me. You're not going. My mom's face went pale, but she didn't speak. It's a full scholarship, I said. I don't care if they're paying you. Girls who leave home end up pregnant or on drugs. You'll stay here and go to community college. I looked at my mom say something. She twisted her wedding ring. Maybe we should discuss this as a family. We are discussing it, rich said. I said, no. My mom looked at her hands. That's when something broke inside me. Not loudly, just a quiet snap. I went upstairs and pulled my suitcase from the closet. Started with clothes, then books. My laptop was still confiscated, so I left it packed.

My mom said, did you really need to get violent? Just a cake. Those words confirmed everything. My feelings didn't matter. My daughter's ruined birthday didn't matter. Nothing had changed. Nothing would ever change. Get off my property, I said, all of you. They left. But that night, my sister posted a video showing me dragging her out and pushing her down. No context, just me looking like a psycho. The cap, should I press charges? The video got 10,000 views overnight. Hundreds of comments calling me abusive. My co workers saw it. My boss saw it. I tried commenting to explain, but she blocked me. Then karma struck. Two weeks later, my nephew attacked another kid at school and bit a teacher hard enough to break skin. My sister screamed about discrimination. The video went viral. People started commenting on her posts about me, pointing out the irony of her calling me abusive while her son literally attacked children. But she didn't stop. At 2:00am, she showed up at my house drunk, pounding on my door, screaming. She kicked it hard enough to crack the wood. I called the police. She failed the breathalyzer. B, a C. Thirteen. They arrested her for public intoxication, trespassing and vandalism. The officer handed me her card. You should get a restraining order. This is escalating harassment. My mother bailed her out. By 6:00am, I filed for a restraining order. Court date came. My sister had a fancy Lawyer, my parents must have maxed out credit cards to pay for it. The judge ordered a psychological evaluation. Three weeks later, the results came back narcissistic personality disorder with dependent features. Psychologist noted a consistent pattern of manipulation, lack of empathy and inability to accept responsibility. My sister went pale. When the judge made the restraining order permanent for two years later, my mom sent me an email with a spreadsheet attached. They given my sister $68,000 over three years, never offered me a cent. Four years later, my daughter turned 12. We threw her the party she actually wanted. Small, calm, drama free, just her five best friends at an escape room. My sister eventually started therapy because family court mandated it. My parents are broke from enabling her and tried reaching out but never apologized. My daughter knows she's loved unconditionally. That pineapple cake was expensive, but learning to value myself, that was priceless.

Two weeks later, she was arrested. I spent months planning my daughter's eighth birthday. She wanted pineapple themed everything. After some cartoon obsession, I ordered a custom three tier cake for $280. Ridiculous, I know, but she deserves something special. My sister showed up 45 minutes late. No apology. Her six year old son looked miserable, eyes puffy, like he'd already been crying. I should have known something was wrong. I was organizing a game when I heard my daughter scream. Not a fun scream, genuine distress. I ran to the kitchen and saw my sister holding my beautiful cake over the trash can. What? What are you doing? I yelled. He doesn't like pineapple! He wants chocolate! I need money to go buy a proper cake. Before I could process, she dropped it. The entire cake hit the bottom with this horrible splat. Frosting exploded everywhere. My daughter burst into full body sobs. Her friends stood frozen, mouths open for the first time. I refused to stay silent. I grabbed my sister's arm and dragged her through the house. She fought me. Her son was wailing. I got her onto the porch and years of suppressed anger finally erupted. She tried to slap me. I caught her wrist and shoved her. She fell on the lawn. That's when my parents pulled up. Growing Up! My sister was the golden child. When I was 12, they gave away my pet rabbit because she was allergic. When I was 15, they canceled my quinceanera and used the $5,000 for her Europe trip. When I made honor roll every semester master, they said good job. When she got a B instead of her usual C, they took her for ice cream. I got into college on scholarship and worked my ass off. She barely graduated high school and lived with my parents for years. When I got pregnant, married and financially stable, my mom asked if it would interfere with babysitting my sister's son. When I grabbed her arm, it wasn't about a cake. It was about 31 years of being invisible. My parents immediately helped her up. My sister started crying. She attacked me. She destroyed my daughter's 300 dollar birthday cake. I

Just him looking tired. I'm sorry, he says. And for a second, I think he means it. My channel was dying. I was three months behind on rent. My manager said vulnerability content performs best. I just needed something that would hit. But none of it happened. I tell him. He shrugs. The algorithm doesn't care if it's true. It cares if people watch. Then tell them that. Post a retraction. He shakes his head and stands up to leave. I really am sorry. But I'm not sorry enough to lose everything.

Other people were watching and recording the whole thing. My mom got between us and shoved me backwards. Just give it to her right now. I stumbled but kept my grip. No, I paid for this. My mom reached for the cup and I turned to block her. That's when her elbow came back and connected directly with my nose. I heard this crunch and felt immediate pain. My hands flew to my face and I dropped the cup. Red started pouring out of my nose. My sister dove for the cup and grabbed it. My mom said, oh, my God, are you okay? Like she wasn't the one who just hit me. My sister was already walking to their car with the cup and my mom was saying, you shouldn't have held on so tight. I didn't mean to hit you, but you were being really aggressive. I looked up and the cup had a huge dent from hitting the concrete. My sister was inspecting it and looked like she was about to cry. My mom turned to me, now look what you did. You ruined it by being so stubborn. A woman from the Crowd came over, do you need me to call an ambulance? My mom waved her off. She's fine. We're her family. My mom walked back to their car and they drove away. Leave me standing there bleeding. I drove myself to urgent care. My nose was broken and the doctor had to reset it. When the doctor asked what happened, I said I got into an accident because I didn't want to say my mom broke my nose over a water bottle. While I was sitting there with gauze packed in my nose, I decided to check my phone. My sister had already posted a TikTok showing her in their car holding the dented Stanley with tears on her face. Her caption said, waited outside target all night in the freezing cold and fought through insane crowds. Here are the battle scars from the Stanley wars. The medical Bill was $800. And my mom said she wasn't paying it because I started the whole thing by refusing to share.

I emailed her the documents right there, the sale agreement, the eat everything. Check your email. I hear her typing. Then nothing. Silence for almost a minute. Why did they sell it? I could lie, but I'm done protecting everyone. To pay for your college. You didn't have savings. They didn't want you taking loans. So they sold the house and use my money to fund your education. More silence. How much? 180 k, 4 years of tuition plus your apartment and meal plan. I can hear her breathing. They told me they'd been saving since I was born. They lied. She hangs up without saying goodbye. That was yesterday. Haven't heard from her since. But my parents, 15 missed calls, dozens of texts. I haven't answered any of them.

She said we couldn't just leave the kids here alone and I agreed. But that didn't mean I had to stay. I told my niece to call her mother right now and tell her to come home. My niece looked panicked and said she didn't think she could handle the kids much longer. And I felt terrible because none of this was her fault. I told her I was sorry, but her mother made this choice. Then I walked back to the car and called the one babysitter I knew who might be available on a Saturday night with zero notice. She answered and I offered her twice her normal rate if she could meet me at my house in 20 minutes. She said yes. I drove home, met the babysitter, handed her $200 cash and thanked her for saving our night. My wife and I drove to the hotel and my phone started ringing immediately sent it straight to voicemail. The hostess seated us at a window table overlooking the city and my wife kept asking if we should check my phone. I said no because I knew exactly what was happening. My sister came home, realised I wasn't there and was losing her mind. The whole dinner, I could feel my phone buzzing in my purse, but I refused to look. We ordered our food and it was incredible. The theater show was even better. When we got to the car around midnight, I finally looked at my phone, 17 missed calls, 32 texts, four voicemails, all from my sister. The final text said, I cannot believe you right now. I just got home and the house is completely destroyed and all four kids are still awake running around like absolute maniacs. And my oldest is crying because she couldn't handle them. And this is your fault because you were supposed to be here helping me and you abandoned my children and now I have to deal with this nightmare and you owe me an apology and you better call me back right now. I read it out loud to my wife and we both laughed. She showed up at my house the next morning and stood on my porch screaming about how I humiliated her and traumatized her children and made her look like a terrible mother. I looked her in the eye and that I had zero regret about what I did, that she made her choice when she abandoned her own kids and expected me to clean up her mess and that I was done being her free babysitter. She tried to tell me that emergencies happen and family helps family. So I asked her what the emergency was. She went, Quiet and then said it was personal and none of my business. I told her to get off my porch. She hasn't spoken to me since.

I chose peace. Within hours, hundreds of comments. Been the background. Sibling, too. Thank you for saying what so many can't. Cousin Danielle. I always thought something was off. I see you now, mom. Some people air their wounds instead of healing them. Victor. Congrats on your pity parade. I didn't respond. My parents never contacted me again. No apology, no acknowledgement. Just silence.

My mother was her usual self, acting excited for us, but making off handed comments about the wedding dress, the food, the venue and the guest seating chart. The comment that hurt the most was when she saw my wedding dress and gushed about how beautiful it was, but it didn't look right around my large waist. But I didn't let that comment get me down. The day of the wedding dawned bright and early and I was running around the venue like a chicken with its head cut off.

I left a table and hurried toward my sister, who was chatting with another cousin. Grabbing her hand, I excused her and let her into the nearby bathroom. What is going on? I hissed. Why does everyone keep touching my stomach? Her eyes widened and she paled slightly, backing away slowly. I guess you haven't heard. Then she asked. Heard what? By this point, I was seething, ready to throw hands. Mom has been spreading a rumor, she said. You might want to talk to her about it. She turned and quickly hurried away, leaving me with more questions. I groaned in frustration and went in search of my mother.

Called Principal Davidson over and showed him something on his phone. Davidson's expression changed from concern to confusion to something I couldn't read. They called Ethan over. He showed them screens of photos and data. Nobody was handcuffing anybody. Davidson walked back to the teachers, his face red. We're calling Ethan's parents and the school board. The building is safe. The situation is not what we thought. An hour later, we were in the cafeteria. Ethan sat at the front with his parents and Davidson. His mom kept her arm around his shoulders. His dad looked angry, but not at Ethan. At us. Davidson cleared his throat. I owe Ethan an apology. What he was keeping in his locker was not drugs or weapons. It was a water testing and filtration system. Been collecting samples from the school's drinking fountains for three weeks. Because he got sick and suspected contamination. The cafeteria went silent. Ethan's dad stood up. My son found lead in your water levels. High enough to cause serious health problems. Been documenting it, testing different fountains, trying to figure out which pipes were the problem before bringing it to anyone. Because he didn't think anyone would believe him. I felt my stomach drop. The chemicals were testing reagents. The glass containers were sample collection. The smell was from the purification process. He wasn't building something dangerous. He was trying to prove the school was poisoning us. The chemicals that scared everyone are from at home. Water testing kits, his mom added quietly. He bought them with birthday money. He's been getting up at 5:00am to collect samples before school. He didn't want anyone to know because he wanted to be absolutely sure first. Davidson continued, independent testers are coming today, but Ethan's results show dangerous lead levels in at least six fountains. The state health department has been notified. Someone asked why he didn't just tell an adult. Ethan finally spoke, barely audible. I pride. I told the nurse I was worried after I got sick. She said I probably just had the flu. I told my science teacher about rust in the fountain. He said old buildings have old pipes and not to worry. No one listens to me. The school closed for two weeks while they replaced pipes. Ethan's testing had been accurate. Lead levels were three times the safe limit. Six other students came forward saying they've been sick, too. The district faced a lawsuit. Ethan was interviewed by the Local news

Let us manage it for you just until you're settled. You kicked me out at 13. I said, I think I'll manage. Their lawyer tried to challenge the will. That's when Caldwell dropped the hammer. First, he said, sliding documents across the table. At 16, Graham legally adopted Noah, which means you have no legal standing in this estate. My mother's mouth fell open. That's impossible. Second, Caldwell continued, Graham hired investigators. We have documented proof of every attempt you made to extort money from him over the years, phone records, bank transfers, emails. Their lawyer started sweating. Third, Caldwell said, opening a letter, Graham left a message. Noah, if they've shown up, I told you they would, don't let them take what you've earned. Family isn't who brings you into the world. It's who shows up when the world walks out. My father slammed the table. This is theft. Finally, Caldwell said, the nuclear clause. If anyone can test this will, all assets transfer automatically to the Children's Cancer Foundation. But only parties with legal standing can trigger that clause, and you have none. I leaned back. So, so go ahead, sue me. The only thing you'll win is a charity donation, mom screamed. After everything we gave you, like what? I interrupted the night you dumped me or the 14 years of silence. After security escorted them out, their screams of betrayal and blood echoed through the lobby as everyone stared. Two days later, they Violated the restraining order I'd filed, showed up at the mansion after dark demanding to talk. I called the cops. They were gone in 60 seconds. The doorbell kept ringing like they were rebooting the house. When I opened the door, they shoved past me. Dad studied every corner like he was mentally pricing everything. Mom ran her hand along the banister as if she already lived there. I pointed to the camera in the corner. Say it louder. Judges love this material. Last time I saw them was on the driveway. Camera driving slowly past the gate, windows down, staring like tourists who couldn't afford the ticket. Inside, Graham told me once, some people grow when they lose power, others shrink. I'm standing in the office now. Quarterly stats are up 30%. Three new stores under construction. My parents are still out there somewhere shrinking.

Glass lodge with hot tub, fire pit, private dock. They flew in two friends and hired a private chef. Mom's Facebook. So proud of our baby boy. He deserves the world. Photos of champagne, fishing, poker. Victor wearing a crown that said birth. They king. My birthday was two weeks later. I cleared my schedule, didn't make plans just in case. At one PM, mom texted, stop by when you're free today. No. Happy birthday. I arrived at 3. Victor was on the couch, dad mowing the lawn, mom in the kitchen. She smiled. Oh, hey, Leo. You made it. She pulled a grocery store cupcake from the fridge. Chocolate base, white icing, no candle, then handed me a card inside. Maybe next year. That was it. I laughed from shock. This is it? Don't be so sensitive, Leo. You're an adult. We figured you didn't need a big Celebration. They didn't even look up from his phone the entire time. Like I wasn't even there. Victor got a weekend retreat with a private chef. Victor's been through a hard time. You're so private, we didn't think you'd want to fuss. I watched the cupcake sweat under fluorescent lights. It. It's not about a fuss. It's about the difference. She Rolled her eyes. This is exactly why we didn't plan anything. You always make everything about you. I pulled out my phone and photographed the cupcake next to the card. Thanks. Then I left. I booked a flight to Lisbon for the next morning. That night, dad texted, where did you go? I didn't respond. Dead. I posted from the airport lounge. Boarding pass visible. Birthday retreat. No chef required. Victor liked it. Mom viewed my story. Ten minutes later, she called. I silenced it. Another call. Text. Leo, this isn't funny. Call me. I wasn't trying to be funny. Messages escalated over the next days. You're in Portugal? Is this a work trip? The card was supposed to be funny then. Mom, you always act like we treat you horribly, but you never say what you want. Maybe if you spoke up, things would be different. Day five.

When my uncle died, they demanded millions. But the lawyer's secret claws left them with nothing. My parents abandoned me with a note on the kitchen counter when I was 13. Uncle Graham will take care of you. We're sorry. That single sentence was supposed to replace 13 years. Mom's daycare had failed. Dad's used car lot was bleeding cash into casino slot machines. Wasn't surprised they left. I was surprised they bothered writing anything at all. Uncle Graham showed up in a black suit and said, pack one suitcase, not two. He wasn't warm. He was efficient. His Victorian mansion had rules. Shoes off, homework at the desk, one hour of piano daily. Break a rule, lose a privilege, no yelling, no drama. Just consequences. I tested him constantly that first year. Skipped piano, rolled my eyes, stayed up past curfew waiting for him to call CPS and ship me somewhere else like my parents did. He never did. He punished me, then stayed for breakfast the next morning. By 16, he legally adopted me. By 18, I was managing his luxury furniture company. By 27, I was running it while he fought leukemia. Eight months later, he died. The funeral was small. His lawyer called a week after. We're reading the will. Friday. I walked into that marble conference, this room, expecting business partners and maybe a charity. Instead, my parents were sitting there in outlet store blazers and Rehearsed smiles.

So when she asked why I wear hats every day, I just said I like hats. She goes, but every day? With this tone like it's weird or something. I told her, yeah, I'm bald, I like my head, but I don't want to look 35 yet. Plus I look good in them now. I wasn't thinking, but she's probably around 35 or older, so maybe that was rude. Then she goes, 29 and wearing hats every day to hide. Wow, that pissed me off. Like who says that? So without even thinking, I shot back, well, since you started here, I've seen you wear makeup every day, even on casual Fridays and on work from home. Zoom calls. So why do you wear makeup every day? Someone in the meeting giggled, but everyone else got real quiet. She looked at me and said, that's a sexist question. I said, how is that sexist? Other women here don't wear makeup every day. My boyfriend wears makeup sometimes when we go to fancy events. He just doesn't do it every day. So why do you? She didn't say anything after that. Just sat there all mad and quiet. One of the other guys at The table went back to the presentation like nothing happened. The rest of the meeting was super awkward. Now she won't talk to me at all.

By evening, she dragged through the door at 7:45, coveralls, filthy, and collapsed at the table. I placed dinner in front of her pan, seared salmon with roasted vegetables and homemade sourdough.

The electrician walked off the job, said you'd been stringing him along and he's done. My stomach dropped. Three weeks of negotiation destroyed. What exactly did you say to him? He was complaining about money. So I told him we'd match whatever he wanted. You promised our most expensive contractor an unlimited rate increase without knowing our project margins. You said I had full authority. Part of that responsibility is understanding that the Henderson project has a 12% profit Margin, you just gave away 8% of it to avoid a difficult conversation. I've been carefully managing silence. Then I quit. Come get your projects back before I destroy everything. Our agreement was seven days. I don't care about the agreement. She was nearly shouting. I can't do this. Every decision feels like drowning. And everyone keeps looking at me like I'm incompetent. So on day 2, you've realized this job might be harder than you thought. It's impossible, yet I do it every single day. While you spent years suggesting anyone could do it with proper training. The line went quiet. Please, she finally whispered. Can we just end this? You were right. I was wrong. Day 2 isn't about proving I was right. It's about you understanding what you've been taking for granted. That evening, she came home in tears.

Fruit flies had established a small civilization. The trash was overflowing onto the floor. Morgan left passive aggressive notes. Some of us have jobs and can't clean 24 7. I added a note below hers. Me too. That's why I only clean my stuff now. Week 2, Morgan tried guilt tripping me in front of her boyfriend. I used to think we were friends, but he won't even help around the apartment anymore. I looked up from my spotless dishes. You called me your personal maid, remember? In front of 15 people. Her boyfriend's face changed. You said what?

When I came back, there was a violation notice on the door. Excessive mess and unsanitary conditions. They had 15 days to fix it or face eviction. Jake was furious. This is your fault. You could have warned us. I was out of town. Besides, I'm not your maid. Remember? They tried cleaning. They really did. But they never actually scrubbed a toilet or degreased a stove in their lives. They bought the wrong products. They didn't know you had to move The furniture to vacuum under it. Morgan had a breakdown trying to figure out how to clean the shower. This is impossible. How did you do all this? Practice, I said. Years of not being a slob. Week 4, they failed the reinspection. The landlord gave them 30 days to vacate. They both blamed me constantly. You ruined our lives over a joke? But their parents, who had to help them move, didn't think it was funny. Morgan's mom took one look at the apartment and said, you're 26 years old. How do you not know how to clean? Jake's dad was even harsher. We didn't raise you to treat people like servants. Last week they moved out. The landlord asked if I wanted to stay with new roommates. The apartment's yours if you want it. I'm increasing rent by $200. But you've earned it for keeping your space clean. I stayed. Got two new roommates who interview next week. First question on my list. When you say you'll clean later, define later.

Couple months back, I was working the evening shift on a Tuesday when this older guy walked in alone. He had this beat up leather jacket and kept his phone on the table, staring at it. I came over, but he just ordered black coffee, didn't even look at the menu. I brought it over and he thanked me. Quiet, barely made eye contact. Just kept staring out the window. His coffee sat there getting cold for almost an hour. I went back to check on him, and he ordered a Caesar salad. I figured maybe he was waiting for someone, but nobody showed. When I brought the salad out, he took like three bites, then pushed it away. His leg was bouncing under the table non stop, and every few seconds he'd grab his phone, check it, and put it back down. You could tell something was eating at him, but I didn't want to be nosy, so I just kept an eye on his section. Another hour passed. The dinner rush came in, and the place got packed with families and couples laughing, but his table stayed quiet. He flagged me down again, and this time ordered tomato soup. I remember thinking, this guy's meal is the saddest thing I've ever seen. And just like the salad, he barely touched it. Just stirred it around, staring at that phone the whole time. By closing time, he was One of the last people there. I walked over with his check, trying to be polite about it, and he finally looked up at me. His eyes were all red, like he'd been holding back tears for hours. He goes, I'm sorry for sitting here all night. I should probably just pay and go. I told him, no rush, but he pulled out his wallet anyway. That's when I saw it. Tucked in the clear sleeve, a photo of this young guy, maybe early 20s, in full military gear, smiling big. The older guy saw me looking, and he didn't get weird about it. He actually pulled the photo out and showed me. He said, that's my son. He's deployed in the Middle East. We were supposed to video call tonight at 6. It was after 9 by then. I asked if something happened, and his voice started shaking. He said, my son called three hours late, told me the internet went down at his base, and sent a text saying they were going on some kind of alert and he'd call when he could. That was the last I heard. He put the photo back, and his hands were trembling. He said I couldn't go home because sitting in that empty house waiting for the phone to ring felt worse than anything. At least here there's people, noise. I'm not just alone, thinking the worst. I felt it right in my chest. I told him, hold on and went straight Back to find my manager. I told her everything. How this guy's been here for hours. His son's overseas, probably in danger, and he's just sitting here waiting. My manager is this tough woman, but she's got the biggest heart. She came out with me, sat down at his table, and said, sir, your meals are on us tonight, and we're packing you dinner to go for tomorrow. You don't worry about any of this. He tried.

Every study session was a party. Every movie night was her getting drunk with strangers. The post that broke me was from last week, a video of her and her friends in someone's car, windows rolled up, smoke everywhere, passing something between them, laughing as smoke poured out of their mouths. My daughter who lectured me about my one cigarette a day habit, who made me quit cold Turkey because she was worried about my health, there she was inhaling deeply, eyes red, coughing and laughing. I didn't recognize her. The way she moved, the way she talked in the videos, even her facial expressions were foreign to me. The most recent post was from tonight, 2 hours ago, a mirror selfie in a bathroom I didn't recognize, clearly drunk. Caption reading, pre gaming for the best night ever. Alex throws the best parties ever. She told me she was sleeping over Potty's house, her best friend since kindergarten, the girl I trusted completely. He was holding a bottle, both of them laughing. I knew Alex. He lived five houses down. I sat there in my dark office, the light from my phone screen the only illumination, watching my daughter live a complete double life. Every post had hundreds of comments from people I didn't know existed, friends she'd never mentioned, guys she was apparently involved with. Without thinking, I looked at my car. Keys and grabbed them. I never drove so fast down our street in my life. Five houses, that's all that separated me from the truth. Alex's house was lit up like a stadium. Music rattling windows three houses away. I didn't knock, just pushed through the front door into a wall of heat and the smell of cheap beer and vape smoke hit me immediately. Kids scrambled out of my way. Drink sloshing. Oh shit. Someone's dad is here, someone whispered. Someone's in trouble, another voice said, laughing. Then they saw my face. The laughter died. I found her in the living room standing on the coffee table, red cup raised, high body swaying to the music. She was mid spin when our eyes met. The cup fell, red liquid splashed across white carpet. The entire room froze. Someone yanked the speaker cord. Dead silence. Aren't you all under 18? I asked in the room? Nobody answered. Nobody moved. I held up my phone. Her finsta profile glowing, 8,000 followers know my daughter better than I do. Hanneem climbed down, stumbling, using the wall for support. Her friends melted backward into the crowd. I grabbed her wrist and pulled her through the sea of teenage faces. Every phone recording her downfall. She looked me dead in the eyes as I buckled her into the passenger seat and said, mom follows my finsta.

This last one is calling my daughter's clothing a gender issue. He cleared his throat. Well, some parents do feel that traditionally masculine attire on a young girl sends confusing messages. I stood up. My daughter wears suits because she likes them. She's not confused. She's confident. And frankly, half these girls come to school in leggings so tight I can see their underwear lines. But you're worried about my kid wearing too much fabric? He raised his hands defensively. I'm just asking you to consider sending Iris in more typical clothing. Jeans, shirts, dresses. Things that don't draw attention. I asked him Point Blank if there was a dress code violation. He admitted there wasn't. Then we're done here. I walked out and took Iris's hand. We went home, and I let her pick out her outfit for the next day. She chose her favorite charcoal suit with a white button up and a little red tie. I helped her polish her shoes and told her she looked like a boss. The next morning, I walked Iris into school myself. Principal Davidson was standing in the hallway, and his face went pale when he saw her suit. I smiled at him and kept walking. By lunchtime, I got another call. Fifteen girls showed up today in suits. Some borrowed from their fathers. Some threw on blazers over their regular clothes. They're calling it Suit Thursday and refusing to change my lip to keep from Laughing? Sounds like Iris started a movement. He was not amused. This is exactly the disruption I was trying to avoid. Your daughter is influencing other students to defy typical dress standards. So let me get this straight. I said slowly, you called my daughter's clothing distracting, and now you're upset that other kids are inspired by her confidence? Unless you're implementing an actual dress code that bans suits, my daughter will continue wearing them. And if you do, I'll be at the next school board meeting with a lawyer. The call stopped after that, but the movement didn't. By Friday, over 30 girls showed up in suits or blazers. Some boys even joined in, wearing ties and dress shoes. The kids called it Power Dress Friday, and it spread to other classes. Parents who'd originally complained started posting pictures of their daughters in suits on social media, acting like they'd supported it all along. One of the mothers who'd written those angry emails even messaged me asking where I bought Iris's clothes. I didn't respond. Principal Davidson sent out a school wide email reminding everyone that self expression through clothing was welcomed as long as it followed basic guidelines. He never mentioned Iris by name, but everyone knew. Three weeks later, the school announced a career day where students could dress as their future professions. Iris wore her usual suit. So did 20 other girls. And Principal Davidson had to stand there and compliment every single one of them.

Your daughter climbed onto the roof. Can you come? I dropped my coffee mug. It shattered, but I was already grabbing my keys. What do you mean she's on the roof? Missus Patterson was breathing heavy, like she'd been running. Emma just climbed out the second floor window onto the main building roof. We can't get her to come back inside. My hands shook so bad, I could barely grip my phone. Emma was terrified of heights. Last month, she cried on the second floor of the mall parking garage. This made no sense. Is she okay? Is she hurt? I was running to my car. She's just standing there. We've been calling to her, but she won't respond. The fire department is on their way. Fire department? My 12 year old was on a roof high enough to need firefighters. The drive normally took 15 minutes. I made it in 7, running two red lights. When I screeched into the parking lot, there were three fire trucks, two police cars and an ambulance. My stomach dropped. When I looked up, Emma was standing on the flat roof section about 30 feet up. But she wasn't alone. Six other kids were up there with her, all holding poster boards. What are they doing? My panic shifted to confusion. Missus Patterson's face turned red. We were in science class when Emma asked for the bathroom. Five minutes later, she was climbing out the window and She convinced six others to follow her. The principal jogged over, looking 10 years older. Missus Anderson. Emma says she's not coming down until the entire school will see her presentation. Presentation? I stared up again. Emma moved to the edge, and I could finally read her poster. Save the school library! They're cutting funding! My mouth fell open. The other kids held similar signs. Books, not budgets. Libraries matter! She's protesting, I whispered. The principal nodded grimly. The school board voted last night to redirect library funding to the new football stadium. Emma found out this morning. A ladder extended toward the roof. Emma saw it and moved closer to the edge. My heart stopped. Emma, please! She looked down and spotted me. Fear flashed across her face, but she didn't move. Mom, they're closing the library! Where am I supposed to go after school while you're at work? That's where Missus Chen helps me with homework. That's where I'm safe. Tear stream

Emma had been cranky, the baby hadn't napped well, the house was a disaster because he'd been too overwhelmed to clean. Could I handle dinner and bedtime alone so he could decompress? Oliver was there watching. I smiled sweetly. Of course, honey, you've had such a hard day. Why don't you and Oliver go out for drinks? My treat. Thomas's eyes lit up. They left immediately. I called my mother, asked her to watch the kids on Saturday, told her I needed to prove something. Saturday morning, I woke Thomas at 6. I have to go into the office. Emergency project. You've got the kids all day. I'll be back by bedtime. He started protesting that Oliver was visiting. They had plans to watch football. Oliver can help you. After all, you said it's basically a vacation. I left before he could argue. But I didn't go to the office. I went to my friend Lisa's house with my laptop and our nanny cam app. Watch the disaster unfold in real time. By 7, the baby was screaming. Thomas couldn't find the formula I'd supposedly made. There were six bottles in the fridge clearly labeled. By 8, Emma had dumped her breakfast everywhere. While Thomas was changing the baby, Oliver was trying to clean it, gagging. By 9, both kids were crying, Thomas was yelling, and Oliver was stressed, eating cereal straight from the box. By 10, Thomas called me 15 times. Didn't Answer, texted once in meetings, handle it like you do every easy day. By noon, the house looked like a tornado hit. Thomas had given Emma three different snacks to keep her quiet. The baby had blown out two outfits and Oliver was hiding in the guest room. Thomas texted that the baby might be sick. I responded with the pediatrician's number. By 3, Thomas was crying on the couch while both kids destroyed the living room. Oliver was trying to build a barrier of couch cushions to contain Emma. By 5, I came home to complete chaos. Toys everywhere, food ground into carpets, both kids filthy and unfed. Since lunch, Thomas, wild eyed and defeated. Oliver packed and leaving immediately. How was your easy day, I asked. Thomas started yelling about how I set him up, abandoned him, that weekends were different. I pulled out my phone, showed him my time sheet. I work 10 hour days, come home and do exactly what you couldn't handle for nine hours every single day while you play games during nap time. Oliver heard everything before he left, told Thomas he was pathetic on his way out. Thomas now handles all child care without complaint. He also got a part time remote job during nap times. Funny how he suddenly found the time once he realized what actual work looked like.

So I gave him a full easy day alone. And by noon he was calling me crying. I've been the sole income earner for our family for four years. When our second child was born, daycare cost would have eaten my entire salary increase from my promotion. So we agreed Thomas would stay home. He'd been laid off from his marketing job anyway and my engineering salary could cover everything. I thought we were a team. I work 50 hours a week minimum, often 60 during project deadlines. Still, I handle bedtime routine, cook weekend meals, do all the grocery shopping, manage the budget, schedule doctor appointments and wake up for night feedings. With our eight month old, Thomas handles weekday childcare and light cleaning. That's the division we agree on. Last week, Thomas's brother Oliver came to visit. I was working from home in my office with the door closed on a critical client call, but I could hear them talking in the kitchen. Oliver asked how Thomas was handling being home all day with two kids. Honestly, it's easier than any job I've had. Emma is 18 months and just plays with blocks all day. The baby mostly sleeps. I get maybe three hours of actual work. The rest is just being present, playing video games while they nap, scrolling my phone while they play the Hard part is when Jennifer comes home exhausted and acts like she's the only one who worked. Oliver asked what I did to help. She thinks doing bedtime is some huge contribution, but the kids are already tired by then and she complains if there's laundry not folded or dishes in the sink like I'm her employee. She has no idea how easy her life is just sitting at a computer all day while I'm actually raising our children. I nearly dropped my laptop. This man who spent yesterday's nap time playing online poker was calling my job easy, who sent me 16 texts during my presentation asking where the baby's purple pacifier was, who called me crying last month because both kids were sick and he couldn't handle it. I stayed on my call, took notes, acted professionally, but I also opened our credit card statement. Thomas had spent $300 on gaming equipment last month, 400 on takeout. He hidden by having it delivered during lunch, a subscription to some sports streaming service I'd specifically said we couldn't afford, all while I was eating packed sandwiches at my desk to save money.

By his 7th birthday, Liam had essentially stopped smiling. That's when I started lying to my wife about where I was going. Three nights a week, I told Nora I joined a grief support group for parents of disabled children. That wasn't technically untrue. I had joined one, attended twice, then stopped going because sitting in a circle talking about feelings wasn't going to help Liam hear music again. Then I started showing up at the university engineering lab where my old colleague Dennis worked on auditory research. I've been an audio engineer before kids and specialized in acoustic design and signal processing. Before work paid better, Dennis had access to equipment I couldn't afford and expertise I didn't have. And when I explained what I wanted to build, he looked at me like I'd lost my mind. A haptic vest that translates music into touch. That's not revolutionary. Those exist already, he said, pulling up commercial examples on his computer. They're crude. I they're basic vibration. I want something that can translate complex musical information that can let a deaf person experience a symphony with the same richness a hearing person does. Every instrument, every voice, every subtle dynamic change. I want my son to feel Beethoven the way Beethoven felt it when he was deaf. Dennis stared at me for a long moment, then said, that's probably impossible. Probably isn't definitely. I said, he's smiled when Can you start? For six months, I spent three nights a week in that lab while Nora thought I was at support group meetings. I'd come home at ten PM smelling like salt and coffee and she'd ask how the meeting was and I'd lie and say it was helpful, that sharing with other parents made me feel less alone. The guilt ate at me, but I couldn't tell her what I was really doing. Not until I knew it would work, not until I had something real to show her. Dennis and I built 17 prototypes. The first ones were disasters, just random buzzing that conveyed no meaningful information. Version 8 showed promise. We could distinguish between base and treble. Version 12 could separate three instruments. Version 15 could map an entire song with enough detail that when I wore it with my eyes closed, I could follow the melody through touch alone. It was extraordinary and terrifying, this feeling of music moving across my chest and back in waves and pulses and rhythms. And I'd stand there in the lab at midnight crying because Liam was going to be able to experience this, was going to get music back then. Version 15 caught fire during testing, literally caught fire, started smoking from a motor that overheated and I ripped it off my chest and watched six months of work burn in a metal trash can. While the smoke alarm screamed, Dennis stood there with a fire extinguisher looking Shaken, and I stood there watching smoke curl toward the ceiling, thinking this was over. I'd failed. There was no time to start again. But what happened next changed everything. Full story is linked below or on my channel.

I was flipping burgers at my summer barbecue when Missus Kowalski's cat literally threw itself through her closed kitchen window, not near the window, through the window. Glass exploded everywhere and this orange tabby landed in her flower bed screeching like it had seen the devil himself. 20 of us just froze mid conversation and stared because cats don't just kamikaze through windows for no reason. Then we heard a man inside Mrs. Kowalski's house scream, what the hell? Followed by the loudest crash I've ever heard. That wasn't a car accident. Mrs. Kowalski, who was standing right next to me holding a plate of potato salad, popped the entire thing on the ground and whispered, I live alone. That's when my roommate, Gavin, who was already six beers deep and shirtless for some reason, grabbed the metal barbecue spatula, held it up like a sword and yelled, who wants to be a hero? Before sprinting full speed toward her back door. Four other drunk guys immediately chased after him, screaming various battle cries. And I just stood there thinking this was either the dumbest or greatest thing I'd ever witnessed. But here's where it gets weird. As Gavin reached Missus Kowalski's back door, it flew open from the inside and a guy in all black came running out carrying a pillowcase full of stuff. He was wearing a ski mask in the middle. Of July and didn't see Gavin until the last possible second. Collided at full speed and the burglar's pillowcase exploded on impact, sending jewellery and electronics flying through the air in slow motion. A laptop hit the fence, rings scattered across the grass and Gavin, who'd somehow held onto his spatula during the collision, just laid there on top of the burglar yelling, I've captured him. I've actually captured him. The burglar tried to scramble away, but Derek tackled him from the side with a pool noodle, which shouldn't have worked, but absolutely did because the burglar slipped on Missus Kowalski's wet grass and went down hard. My cousin Felix, who'd grabbed a bag of charcoal for reasons nobody understood, stumped the entire thing on the guy's head. The burglar was now covered in black dust, coughing and blind. And that's when Julian appeared out of nowhere, holding a massive watermelon above his head like the boulder from Indiana Jones. Time actually seemed to slow down as Julian wound up his throat. Everyone watching started yelling different things. Don't do it. Do it. That's EV.

I said I'd think about it. While my phone was recording, David leaned back in his leather chair, smirking like he just offered me a gift instead of sexual harassment. Take the weekend to consider it, Amanda, but Monday morning, I need an answer. I nodded slowly, clutching my phone tighter in my blazer pocket. The recording app had been running for the past 10 minutes of our performance review, but I kept my expression neutral. That's quite an offer, David. I appreciate you being so direct about the requirements. Chuckled, completely missing my sarcasm. I knew you were smart. This promotion comes with a 40,000 dollar raise and your own office all for one little favor. Therefore, I smiled sweetly. Just to clarify, you're saying sexual favors are part of the promotion criteria at this company. But David didn't realize he was digging his own grave. Look, it's not official policy, obviously, but I handpick my senior managers personally, very personally. He winked in the most disgusting way possible between you and me. Jennifer from accounting got her raise the same way. So did Lisa and marketing. Therefore, I made a mental note to contact Jennifer and Lisa immediately. This predator had been hunting for years. But what David didn't know was that I've been documenting his behavior for months. Every inappropriate comment, every accidental shoulder touch, every time he'd cornered female employees in empty Conference rooms. Therefore, I had a folder on my desktop labeled Vacation Photos that contained screenshots with statements and now this recording. The weekend would be very productive indeed. But Monday morning arrived and David was practically vibrating with anticipation. So, Amanda, have you made your decision? His eyes were already undressing me. I sat down and pulled out my phone. Actually, I have. I've decided to share our conversation with some people. Therefore, his confident smirk started to falter when I hit play on Friday's recording. His own voice filled the.

Three days later, he was in handcuffs. Grandma Violet made me promise three things before she died. First, that I'd water her roses every Sunday even after she was gone. Second, that I'd finish my nursing degree and not give up when things got hard. Third, that I'd watch out for something. She wouldn't explain, just said I'd know it when I saw it. She squeezed my hand so hard when she said that last part. Her fingers ice cold, but her grip desperate. And I promised, even though I didn't understand. She I Tuesday morning at 6:47, with me holding one hand and the hospice nurse checking her pulse with the other. And I thought that strange, final promise would just be one of those deathbed things people say when they're scared and confused. Used. I was wrong. The thing grandma warned me about showed up exactly three days later, wearing an expensive suit I'd never seen before and demanding half of everything she'd left behind. My stepbrother Garrett walked into that lawyer's office on Friday morning looking like he'd won the lottery. And by Friday afternoon, he was in the back of a police car with his hands cuffed behind his back, screaming about his rights while his mother sobbed on the sidewalk. The story of how we got from point A to point B involves forged signatures, hidden cameras, a suspicious Rolex, and the fact that my grandmother was apparently way smarter. And way more. More than any of us realized, Garrett showed up to grandma's funeral on Wednesday wearing a suit that probably cost $3,000. Which was weird, because two months ago, he'd called my dad begging for money to pay his electric Bill. Dad gave him $400, like he always did, and Garrett never paid it back. So, like he always did. But now he had Italian shoes and a watch that caught the light every time he moved his wrist. This gold Rolex that he kept adjusting and showing off like he wanted people to notice. I noticed. I spent the entire funeral watching him work the room at the reception, shaking hands with grandma's friends and accepting condolences like he was the grieving grandson there. Every day, the reality was different. Garrett had visited grandma exactly twice during her ten month cancer battle. Once at Christmas when his mom, Patricia, dragged him there for the obligatory family photo. And once in February for about 15 minutes when he needed to borrow Grandma's car because his truck was repossessed. I know because I was there three days a week minimum, sleeping in the chair beside her bed, helping her to the bathroom at 3:00am, holding her hand through the

Yesterday he put on headphones and cried. The fever spiked to 104 while Liam was singing in the bathtub. One minute he was humming Daniel Tiger off key. The next his eyes rolled back and his body went rigid. I screamed for my wife Nora, and we wrapped him in a towel, his skin burning against my chest. The er doctor took one look at his stiff neck and said the word that stops parents hearts, meningitis. What they didn't tell us in that moment, what we discovered six days later when Liam came home, was that the bacteria had already destroyed his cochlear nerve completely, irreversibly. At age 6, my son went from singing constantly to living in total silence. And the audiologist who delivered the diagnosis said there was nothing anyone could do. No hearing aids would help. No surgery could fix it. Liam was profoundly deaf and would be for the rest of his life. I watched him try to talk to his four year old sister Penny the day after we got the diagnosis, watched him yell, thinking he was speaking normally. Watched Penny's face crumble in confusion and fear at her brother's distorted voice. That's when something broke inside me. Not broke like giving up, broke like the moment you realize you'll do anything, break any rule, spend any amount of time to fix what feels unfixable. Liam spiraled fast. Within three months, he'd stopped trying to Talk, stop playing with other kids. Spent hours sitting in his room staring at nothing. His second grade teacher called weakly with concerns. He wasn't participating, wasn't socializing, seemed depressed in ways that terrified her. We tried sign language, but Liam hated it, would throw fits and cover his eyes so he didn't have to watch us gesture. He wanted his old life back and couldn't understand why we couldn't just make his ears work again. The worst part was watching him watch penny. She'd dance around the living room to songs he couldn't hear, and he'd sit on the couch with tears running down his face, his small hands pressed against the speaker, trying to feel vibrations that meant nothing. Music had been his favorite thing. He'd sung constantly before the meningitis, made up songs about dinosaurs and trucks and whatever crossed his mind. Now all of that was gone.

Dad yelled. They didn't know I earned $15 million a year. So I just smiled and left. I haven't spoken to my parents in three years. Not since my dad told me to go live on the streets if I thought I was so successful. Emergency family meeting. My mom texted when I arrived. My sister Lily was on the couch with that smug look she wore when she knew something I didn't. My dad didn't let me sit down. You're 32, Adrian. This online nonsense needs to stop. Stop. Time to get a real job. I stood there in eight hundred dollar sneakers they thought were knockoffs, holding keys to a car they assumed I leased. Lily laughed. We all know you're barely getting by living in that tiny apartment driving that old car. It's embarrassing. My mom stepped forward. We've decided to stop enabling you. No more Sunday dinners. You need to stand on your own. I've never asked you for money. Not once. The point is, you're a failure. My dad snapped. You're doing so well. Prove it. Go live in the streets for all I care. The room went silent. Lily sipped her wine like she was watching her favorite show. I could have shown them the eight figure balance, the three companies I own, the penthouse I bought in cash. Instead, I picked up my jacket. Alright, if that's What you want? I walked out without looking back. Three weeks later, my father's business partner, James, called. Your father just invested his retirement into a development project downtown. Half a million dollars. My stomach dropped. Why are you telling me? Because it's your project. He has no idea you're the primary investor. My father had poured his life savings into my property development. He thought he was getting in on a hot deal. He had no clue the anonymous investor was me. James continued. He's been telling everyone you're a deadbeat at the country club, business dinners, says you're homeless, that they kicked you out because you refused to grow up. There's more, James added. He convinced Lily to invest, too. She put in $80,000. Your entire family's financial future is tied to your project now. I felt sick.

Been there 20 minutes? Two bags. She hasn't moved. I scrambled outside with my wife, Violet. Grandma, May 75, sat on freezing concrete at 5:30 a. M. Two busted suitcases beside her. One had a folded note shoved through the handle. She wasn't crying or yelling, just staring at the ground, hands shaking, face pale. We rushed her inside, wrapped her in blankets, cranked the heat.

She still lives with our parents and they act like every purchase she makes is some kind of amazing achievement. When I heard target was dropping a new Halloween design, I knew it would be chaos.

I was walking to my car when I heard someone screaming my name across the parking lot. My sister was sprinting toward me with my mom speed walking behind her. My sister was in pajamas and one slipper and my mom was in a bathrobe that was flapping open. I must have jumped out of bed when they saw my Instagram story. My sister ran up and grabbed my shoulders. Oh, thank god you got one. Give it to me right now. Not asking, commanding. I pulled away. What? No. I waited in line for this. Her face went from relieved to furious. Are you serious? Right now you have like a million of these at home? I need this one. I. I told her to try going inside to see if there were any left.

I started losing my hair at 21 and instead of trying to do some weird comb over thing, I just shaved it all off. My hair was super curly and thick anyway, so there was no hiding it. In college, everyone said I looked good bald, told me I had a nice head shape, compared me to Terry Crews and Shack. I was cool with it. But then when I hit 25, people kept thinking I was like 30 or older. Some dude at a bar asked if I had kids, I'm trying to date and Go out and everyone thinks I'm way older than I am.

Nervous as hell. I braced myself for awkwardness, for polite smiles, for that stranger in a family gathering vibe. It never came. The second I walked in, her dad pulled me into a hug and said, we're so glad you're here, son. Her mom had made extra food and kept asking if I wanted seconds. Little brother challenged me to video games. Her grandma kept calling me dear and making sure I had enough pie. They treated me like I'd always been part of the family. We played board games. We watched Christmas movies. Her dad told embarrassing stories about Zoe. Her mom showed me photo albums. I helped her brother set up his new gaming console. It felt easy, natural, like I actually belonged. Meanwhile, my phone started blowing up. Around noon, my mom finally realized I wasn't coming to the camp. Where are you? We thought you'd at least stop by. I texted back, I'm with people who actually want me around. That set off a chain reaction. My siblings started group messaging saying I was being dramatic and ruining Christmas. My sister called me selfish for making mom cry. My brother said I was acting like a child. My dad sent a long text about how I was tearing the family apart over one mistake and I should be ashamed. One mistake. As if forgetting to invite their own son to Christmas was just an Oops. As if 29 years of making me feel like an inconvenience could be summed up as one mistake, I turned my phone off and went back to Zoe's family table. We were passing dishes and laughing at inside jokes they were already including me in. And I realized something. This is what it's supposed to feel like. Being wanted isn't selfish. Being included shouldn't be something I have to beg for. Later that evening, Zoe's dad asked me to help him with something in the garage. While we were out there, he stopped and looked at me. You know, son, he said, families are the people who show up for you. Blood just means you started in the same place. Don't let anyone make you feel guilty for using people who choose you back. I almost cried right there. This man who barely knew me had given me more validation in one day than my own father had in 29 years. My family is still mad. They're saying I'm being ungrateful and overdramatic, that I'm punishing them for one oversight. But it wasn't one oversight. It was a lifetime of being forgotten. Best Christmas I ever had.

My daughter Iris is obsessed with professional clothing. She's 9 years old and watches Shark Tank religiously. She wears blazers on weekends and owns more dress pants than I do. When other kids her age wanted Disney princess dresses, she asked for a tailored navy suit for her birthday. I thought it was adorable and empowering. She felt confident and ready to conquer the world in her little blazers and loafers. So when she started fourth grade, I let her dress herself. Mostly suits, button UPS, sometimes a vest. She looks like a tiny CEO and she loved it. Her teacher, Mrs. Kimball, even complimented her style during parent teacher night. But then last Wednesday, I got a call from the school office asking me to come in immediately. No explanation, just that it was urgent. My heart dropped. I thought she was hurt or sick. I left work and drove there in fifteen minutes and shaking the whole way. When I arrived, Iris was sitting outside the principal's office, perfectly fine, reading a book in her gray pinstripe suit. I asked her what happened and she just shrugged. Principal Davidson called me inside and closed the door. He told me we needed to discuss Iris's clothing choices. I was confused at first, thought maybe her suit had gotten torn. But then he said the words that made my blood boil. Iris's attire has become a distraction. To other students. And I need her to dress more appropriately for her age. I stared at him. She's wearing a suit. It's not revealing, it's not offensive. It's literally more coverage than most kids clothes. He nodded slowly. I understand, but several parents have complained. Their daughters are now demanding suits and professional clothing, and it's causing issues at home. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. You're telling me my daughter can't wear a suit because other kids want to wear suits, too? He shifted uncomfortably. It's creating unrealistic expectations. Iris's wardrobe is clearly expensive, and not all families can afford that. We try to maintain an environment where all students feel equal. I felt my face getting hot. First of all, her suits are from target and thrift stores. Second, are you seriously telling me to change what my daughter wears because other parents can't say no to their kids? He pulled out a folder and slid it across the desk. Inside were printed emails from parents. One mother wrote that her daughter cried for three hours because she wanted a blazer like Iris. Another said their family was struggling financially and couldn't be with Iris's wardrobe. The last one was the worst. Some parent had written an entire paragraph about how Iris was creating gender confusion by dressing like a boy and it was inappropriate for elementary school.

Then he refused to be in photos with me. So I gave a speech that made him storm out in tears. I only came for your mother. My stepdad, Greg, said it while we waited for the ceremony to start. Four years of engineering school, summer camp, laude, full scholarship, job offer from Tesla. Waiting. And Greg showed up to make sure I knew he didn't care. My mom stood beside him, pretending she didn't hear. She'd been doing that for 12 years. And Greg's cruelty was just his personality, just his sense of humor, just who he was. When the photographer asked for family photos, Greg stepped back. I'm good. Just get him and his mother. The photographer looked confused. Don't you want to be in it? Greg shrugged. Not really. Only here for her. My mom's smile was frozen. It's fine. We'll do some with all of us later. We never did. The ceremony started. Names called, diplomas handed out. When they announced my name with honors, my mom stood and cheered. Greg sat scrolling his phone. Afterward came the reception. Prince gave speeches, thanked parents, talked about sacrifice and support. Then the dean asked if anyone else wanted to share. I stood up. I wasn't planning this, but Greg's words were burning in my chest. I'd like to say something. The mic crackled as I took it. My name is David Chen, and today, I'm graduating with a degree in mechanical engineering. I did it on a full academic scholarship. Worked two jobs to cover what the scholarship didn't. Graduated top of my class. But the person who taught me the most isn't here. My mom shifted uncomfortably. I looked up from his phone. My real father died when I was 10. I continued. He was a machinist. Worked with his hands. Never went to college. But he taught me that effort matters. That showing up matters. That being present for the people you love matters. When my mom remarried, I hoped I'd have that again. Someone who showed up, someone who cared. Instead, I got Greg. The room went quiet. Greg's face darkened. For twelve years, Greg has made it clear I'm not his kid. Not his problem, not his concern. He didn't come to my robotics competitions. Didn't ask about my grades. Didn't show up when I won the state engineering fair. And today, when my mom asked him to take a photo with us. He said,

Now my family is losing it because I'm finally happy. I'm 29 and I've always been the afterthought, the oops, baby, maybe. My siblings are all 10+ years older and my parents basically checked out of parenting by the time I came around. By the time I was forming real memories, they were already teenagers living their own lives growing up. Every school event I had they missed. Every choir performance I begged them to attend, they had an excuse for, we're busy. We already have plans. It's just a little kids recital. I remember standing on stage searching the audience for a familiar face and finding no one. Eventually, I just stopped asking. I gave up singing entirely and buried myself in computers instead. That paid off. I work in it now, managing a team of 15 people. Servers don't stop crashing just because it's a holiday, which means I've missed plenty of family events over the years, but they never even ask. They just assume we figured you were working. Those five words have been the default excuse for as long as I can remember. The one tradition I thought was sacred was Christmas Eve dinner. No matter what, I'd finish work late and show up. It wasn't much, but it was mine. The only ones who seemed genuinely happy to see me were my nieces. To them, I'm the fun. Uncle who sneaks them extra dessert, who actually listens when they talk about their favorite Youtubers. Last week, I stopped by my parents house. My nieces ran up to me all excited. Are you excited for Christmas, uncle? Yeah, of course. I said. What's the big plan this year? The cabin, my youngest niece said, grinning. Mom says it's got a hot tub and everything. I blinked, what cabin? I turned to my mom the moment I saw her expression, awkward, caught off guard, guilty. I knew. Oh, that she, well, we figured you had to work again, so everyone thought you wouldn't mind missing one Christmas. Missing one Christmas as if I hadn't already missed pieces of so many others. And the worst part, they never even told me. If I hadn't randomly stopped by, I wouldn't have known until Christmas Day when nobody answered their phones. I hugged my nieces goodbye I, and left. I drove home in silence. And somewhere between their house and my apartment, I completely broke down. My girlfriend, Zoe, who I've only been dating since Thanksgiving, heard what happened and immediately said, come spend Christmas with my family. Her family, who I'd met exactly once, wanted me there. My family, who has known me my whole life, forgot about me. When I told her I wasn't sure if it was too soon, she squeezed my hand and said, my parents already know you're coming. Christmas morning.

No, you didn't. Mom and dad Are letting you live there rent free. My brain breaks. What? They told me they're letting you stay there since you work from home. That it's still their house. I emailed her the documents right there. The sale agreement, the deed, everything. Check your email. I hear her typing. Then nothing. Silence for almost a minute. Why did they sell it? I could lie, but I'm done protecting everyone. To pay for your college. You didn't have savings. They didn't want you taking loans. So they sold the house and used my money to fund your education. More silence. How much? 180 k, 4 years of tuition, plus your apartment and meal plan. I can hear her breathing. They told me they'd been saving since I was born. They lied. She hangs up without saying goodbye. That was yesterday. Haven't heard from her since. But my parents. 15 missed calls, dozens of texts. I haven't answered any of them.

You're a stranger who been handed everything while I was given nothing. I don't owe you a single thing. I closed the door. My parents didn't speak to me for eight months. When they finally called, it was because my brother had been evicted again. Maybe you could help him with first month's rent? My mother asked. No. He's family. So am I. And you never helped me. The line went quiet. Then that was different. You didn't need it. I needed a lot of things I never got. The difference is I survived. Anyway, I hung up. My brother kept his warehouse job. Eventually got an apartment, started community college. I heard updates through acquaintances. I was glad for him, in an abstract way. But his journey was his own, not my responsibility. I sat on my porch one evening drinking coffee in my house earned through a decade of work. They tried to take it from me. They failed. Because I didn't just win a house. I won myself.

Every summer my grandparents would invite us up for a week. Best memories of my childhood happened there.

Why would you sell it? Turns out my sister had no college savings. The scholarship she was counting on fell through and my parents couldn't afford her tuition. I asked why she didn't just get student loans. We don't want her ruining her credit this young.

Because that's where we're having our honeymoon. Two weeks alone at the Lakehouse. We need privacy. I actually laugh because I think she's joking. She's not. That's literally the first time hearing of this. Mom and dad said it was fine. It's not their house. They can't clear anything. She looks at me like I'm insane. What are you talking about?

I've gotten 20 calls from people apologizing. I played dumb. Really? That's weird. She pressed harder. Did you put the wrong date on the invitations? I told her to check hers. Long silence. She screamed, Wednesday? Why is the wedding on a Wednesday? We wanted to make sure only people who really Wanted to be there, could make it work, I said. She started yelling about how I humiliated her, how she told all these people to save the date and now she looked like a liar. I stayed calm. You gave me a list. I invited everyone on it. I can't control their work schedules, mom. She called me manipulative and cruel. I reminded her she refused to pay a single dollar but demanded we invite over 100 people we couldn't afford. She hung up. Wedding day came. My mom showed up but barely spoke to anyone. The venue looked beautiful with our 30 guests. Everyone there actually knew our stories, actually cared. During our vows, the toasts were personal and genuine. At the reception, Brian's dad pulled us aside and said, this is the most intimate wedding I've ever been to. You can tell everyone here loves you, too. My mom overheard and her face went red, but she said nothing. She left before dessert was served.

She claimed I've been hurting her since she was a kid. Physical abuse, years of it. My stomach dropped. That's not true, I said, my voice shaking. I never touched her, not once. But they didn't care. Emma had given them dates, fake injuries, even fake witnesses, friends of hers who agreed to lie. They arrested me right there. Handcuffs, fingerprints, a cell. My whole life fell apart in one afternoon. I spent six months in jail, waiting for trial. Six months of pure hell. My wife visited once, crying, asking if Any of it was true. The fact that she even had to ask felt like a knife in my chest. My friends stopped calling. My neighbors whispered when they saw my wife at the store. Even after I told everyone the truth, the damage was done. People always wonder, what if he really did it? My lawyer worked day and night to prove my innocence. Slowly, the truth came out. Emma's friends cracked under questioning, admitting she paid them to lie. Text messages surfaced where Emma bragged to someone about teaching dad a lesson for kicking me out medical

Mom. Sarah's voice was quiet but firm. Her eyes met mine and I saw something hard there, something angry. Sarah, it's okay. This is your graduation. I'll just, we're leaving, mom. What? No, honey, you can't. We're leaving, she said louder. The music stopped. Everyone went silent. 500 people in expensive clothes turned to watch as my daughter looked directly at Missus Morrison. You just made the worst mistake of your life, Sarah said clearly. Then she walked out with me, leaving her diploma behind, still in her cap and gown. We drove home in silence. Sarah's hands gripped the steering wheel tight. She'd never told me where she got the money for this car, just said it was from work stuff. When we got to our apartment, she finally spoke. I saw it, mom. I saw them write it. Then why didn't you stop them? Because I needed to see if they'd really do it. Her voice shook, if they'd really insult the woman who gave up everything for me. She opened her laptop. Mom, remember my tech internship, the one I said was boring? I nodded. My team created an app for student loans, a platform that helps students manage debt. Last month, a big company bought it. She looked at me, for $18 million. I couldn't breathe. What? And for the past six months, I've been quietly donating to Westfield, new computers, new library books, scholarships. Her fingers moved across the keyboard. As of yesterday, I'm their largest private donor, $22 million pledged. Sarah, This morning at 8, I canceled it, all of it, every single dollar. My hand covered my mouth. The university is already struggling. They were counting on my money for next year's budget. Without it, they'll have to cut programs, lay off staff, maybe even lose accreditation. Her phone started ringing. She ignored it. Finally, she answered. Dean Morrison. I could hear him begging through the speaker, apologizing, offering anything. Sarah's voice went cold. Your wife called my mother trailer trash. You stood there and let them mock the woman who worked night shifts so I could study. You chose cruelty. Now you lose everything. Please, the university should have thought about that before you let them humiliate a janitor who's worth more than all of you. She hung up and looked at me. They wanted to know where I came from. Now they'll never forget. Full story on the channel linked below.

But my seat had a sign that read Trailer Trash, Welfare Mom. The dean's wife laughed until my daughter said, mom, we're leaving. The next morning, the university received a call that changed everything. 15 years. That's how long I raised Sarah alone after her dad left us with nothing but bills. 15 years of cleaning offices at night, clipping coupons, and wearing the same winter coat so she could have a new backpack each year. 15 years of helping with science projects at our small kitchen table, driving her to soccer practice in my beat up Honda, and never missing a parent teacher meeting. But we did it. Sarah graduated top of her class with a full scholarship. And now she was getting her diploma from Westfield University, one of the best schools in the state. The ceremony was in the grand auditorium. Everything looked expensive. Marble floors, gold curtains, fancy programs with thick paper. I sat in my target dress, the nicest thing I owned. But I didn't care. My daughter was graduating. That's all that mattered. I found my seat in the family section. Little cards marked each spot with names printed in fancy letters. Mine said, Linda Chen, mother of Sarah Chen. But someone had added below it in black marker, trailer trash, welfare mom. My heart sank. I stared at it, hoping I'd read it wrong, but no, it was right there. I Looked up and saw them, Dean Morrison's wife and her friends, whispering and giggling while looking straight at me. Their designer purses probably cost more than three months of my rent. Well, what did we expect, Missus Morrison said loudly. She works as a janitor. Probably lives in some dump. Her friend laughed. I heard she's on food stamps and she thinks she belongs here with real parents. The other women joined in, their laughter getting louder. People around us started staring and whispering. My face felt hot. Fifteen years of working two jobs. Fifteen years of being everything for Sarah. And they turned it into a joke. I stood up to leave quietly. I wouldn't ruin Sarah's big day.

But what she did next stunned the whole room and ruined his life. For three years, I've been walking on eggshells around David. The hit started small. A backhand when dinner was cold, shove when I disagreed, always behind closed doors. Always followed by apologies. His mother, Margaret, had been visiting for the weekend. I've been trying so hard to be the perfect wife. Margaret Morrison was everything I wasn't. Polished, educated, old money. She'd made it clear I wasn't good enough for her son. The girl from the wrong side of town who trapped her boy all weekend. I made her favourite meals, cleaned the house twice, bit my tongue when she criticised everything. The explosion came over something stupid. I'd accidentally used the good China for lunch instead of saving it for dinner. The Haviland porcelain. Worth more than I made in a week. David's face went red the moment he saw it. What the hell is wrong with you? His voice low and dangerous. I specifically told you those were for tonight. I'm sorry, I whispered, reaching to clear the table. I'll wash them and reset everything. His mother sat right there, sipping her tea. I thought maybe her presence would keep him calm. I was wrong. David grabbed my wrist hard. You never listen, do you? You're too stupid to follow simple instructions. I tried to pull away. Please, you're hurting me! His Mother continued drinking her tea, face expressionless. That's when he did it. Right in front of his mother, he drew back his hand and slapped me across the face. Impact sent me stumbling backward, my cheek burning, blood in my mouth. I stood there stunned, waiting for his mother to gasp, to object, to do something. She'd always been so proper, so concerned with appearances. Instead, she sat down her teacup with a delicate clink, looked directly at her son. David Anthony Morrison, she said, her voice cutting like a blade, what did you just do? Something in her tone made David freeze. I asked you a question. What did you just do to your wife?

I sent the invitations but changed the date and time and watched everyone decline. Brian and I wanted 30 people at our wedding, close friends, immediate family, people who actually knew us. Then my mom found out. She called and said, you need to invite everyone. Your cousins, my book club, the neighbours, everyone. I tried explaining we couldn't afford it. We've been saving for two years and had a budget that worked. But she talked over me. This is my only daughter's wedding. People will talk if you don't invite them. The next week she showed up with a handwritten list, 112 names, people I barely knew or hadn't seen in years. Dad's cousins who lived three states away, her co workers from the dental office, old neighbors who moved when I was 12, her boss, her boss's wife, random people from her gym. These people need invitations, she said. I already told most of them they're invited. Ryan looked at the list and went pale. This is going to cost us another $15,000 minimum. My mom waved her hand. It's one day. You'll make it work. I asked if she'd help. Hey, since she was demanding all these extra guests, she laughed. We already gave you the rehearsal dinner budget. That's generous enough. Then she said, oh, and you'll need to make all the invitations yourself. I'm not paying for fancy printing. She wanted me to Invite over 100 extra people we couldn't afford and hand make their invitations. I want them mailed in two weeks, she added. That night, I spent an hour crying to Brian about how this was supposed to be our day, not a showcase for my mom's ego. Every single demand was about her image. She wanted my estranged aunt there because what will people think if family isn't invited? She wanted her boss there because it'll be good for my reputation. She wanted the neighbors so she could show off how beautiful my daughter is. Nothing about what we wanted, nothing about our actual relationships. I spent the next five days hand making invitations. My fingers cramped from cutting cardstock. I burned through three ink cartridges printing addresses. When I finally finished all 112 invitations, I showed my mom. She looked at it for maybe four seconds and said, these look fine, I guess. Do you use the expensive paper I told you about? I hadn't because she never mentioned expensive paper. She sighed. Well, hopefully people won't notice. At least they'll know I raised you to be crafty. My body burned with anger all over.

When my brother wanted new sneakers, they appeared within days. When I needed school supplies, I heard lectures about budgeting. He was 12 when they bought him his first laptop. I was 15 when I bought my own with money from my weekend job. Your brother needs support, my mother would say. He's more sensitive. You've always been the strong one. Strong? That word became my cage. It meant I didn't deserve comfort. When I came home exhausted from double shifts, it meant my accomplishments were expected, while his mediocrity deserved Celebration. At 16, I worked 40 hours weekly at a warehouse. My brother spent two months at summer camp in Colorado. My hands were rough with calluses. He sent postcards about horseback riding. When my brother crashed my mother's car during his first week with a license, she cried about how traumatized he must be. When I scratched my father's car three years earlier, I paid for the repair from my own savings. By 23, I'd opened my own salon. Four styling chairs in a strip mall. Mine, earned through brutal work schedules and skipped meals my parents visited once. Must be expensive to maintain. My father said, your brother's been looking at business opportunities. My mother added, he's very interested in entrepreneurship. Interested, the word for my brother's brief enthusiasms that never translated into effort. By 26, I had real savings. I started looking at houses. That's ambitious, my father said in a tone that suggested reckless. I've been saving for years. I'm ready. My mother's expression shifted. We'll see. Weeks later, every time I mentioned house hunting, they'd steer toward my brother's latest struggles. Then I found text on my mother's phone while she was in the bathroom. She'd been telling my brother, don't worry. She'll buy something big enough for both of you. We'll make sure of it, my brother had replied. What if she says no? She won't. She never does. They'd planned this for months. That dinner they finally said it. When you buy your house, maybe your brother could live there just until he gets on his feet.

She studies poverty and homeless mothers. She explained how Nadia's situation left her with no other options. But the prosecutor destroyed her. On cross examination, Doctor Calman, was what Nadia did a crime? Yes or no? Yes. But. Yes or no? Yes. Thank you. That's all? He looked at the jury. Don't let emotion cloud the fact. The jury went to decide. They came back in 20 minutes. That's the fastest I've ever seen. Nadia was doubled over in pain next to me. She knew we'd lost. Judge Brenner walked in. Has the jury reached a verdict? Yes, your honor. The judge opened the paper. In the case of the people versus Nadia Reeves, we find the defendant. Nadia suddenly scream. She grabbed her stomach and fell backward. Her chair crashed to the floor. I'm giving birth! She screamed. The prosecutor jumped up. Your honor, she's faking. She's trying to manipulate the jury. But Nadia's water had already exploded everywhere. Gallons all over the floor. She was crying and gasping. The prosecutor went completely still. All the color drained from his face. Get an ambulance! Judge Brenner screamed. Paramedics burst in 10 minutes later. While I held her hand, they loaded Nadia onto a stretcher. She was screaming now, in pain. Terrified. She grabbed My jacket. You're the only one who showed me kindness. Please don't leave me. I climbed into the ambulance with her. I'm not leaving you. The door slammed shut, sirens blaring. We raced toward the hospital. Nadia was squeezing my hands so hard, I thought my bones would break. She was having contractions every minute. I'm scared, she cried. What happens to my baby? We're getting you help. Just breathe. I coached her using techniques I'd Learned from my wife's delivery. We pulled up to the emergency entrance. I started helping the paramedics rush her inside. That's when I saw them. The prosecutor and six federal agents in suits right behind us. Stop! The lead agent cut in front of us and blocked the hospital doors. Nadia Reeves needs to be handcuffed to the bed before she gives birth. She's a convicted felon. Are you heartless or just stupid? I yelled, tried to shove past him. The six agents instantly grabbed my shoulders and held me back. The prosecutor stepped forward. She's getting cuffed to the bed, and when she gives birth, we're taking that baby and sending her to prison. I looked back at Nadia on the stretcher, crying in pain and frustration.

What happened during your case that made international news? I was locking up my office at midnight when I heard footsteps running behind me. I turned around. A pregnant woman was sprinting toward me. Huge stomach, crying hard. She looked like she was about to collapse. Please! She grabbed my arm. Please! You're a lawyer, right? I saw the sign. I need help. Ma'am, it's midnight. Call my office tomorrow. My trial is tomorrow morning. She was sobbing. I'm eight and a half months pregnant. They want me to go to prison. They'll take my baby away forever. I stopped. What's the charge? Armed robbery. I stole baby formula and diapers from a store. I'm homeless. I had a gun. I was desperate. She could barely breathe. My public defender says I should plead guilty. Three years in prison. But if I go to prison, I will lose my baby. He's the only thing I have to live for. I looked at her stomach, then at my watch. The trial was in nine hours. What's your name? Nadia Reeves. Come inside. We need to talk. We spent all night in my office, where Nadia told me everything. I read her case file and saw the security footage showing everything. This looked like a certain loss. But I couldn't just let a pregnant woman lose her child. I'll represent you. Trial starts at 9:00am. Get some sleep. The next morning, we walked into the courthouse together. Nadia could barely walk. Her stomach was huge. She looked terrified. The prosecutor saw us coming and smiled like he'd already won. The trial started. The prosecutor played the security footage first. Clear as day, Nadia pointing a loaded gun at the store clerk's face, taking money and baby supply eyes. The jury watched in silence, already deciding she was guilty. Then the store clerk testified. He was shaking. She put the gun against my forehead, right here. He pointed. She said, give me everything or I'll shoot. I thought she was going to kill me. I stood up fast. Your honor, my client was desperate. She was homeless and pregnant. Prosecutor cut me off. Motive doesn't matter, your honor. A crime is a crime. Judge Brenner agreed. Overruled. Sit down, counselor. I tried again. I wanted to show the jury the full extent of Nadia's situation. How she had no money, how she was living in her car, how they would have done the same in her shoes. But the prosecutor stood up. He was smirking now. Desperation doesn't excuse armed robbery, your honor. If it did, we'd have to let half the criminals in the city go free. Three jurors nodded. I was losing. Then the prosecutor dropped his bomb. He showed Nadia's internet history. Three days before the robbery, she'd searched pawn shops, store hours, how much baby items sell for. This proves she planned it. The prosecutor said this wasn't desperation. This was a calculated crime. I jumped up. She Was trying to find ways to get money for her baby.

This is exactly what happens at every birthday of mine. The only difference is I'm not allowed to cry about it. Mom's voice cracked, horrified by the sudden public exposure. You're older. You should know better. So when I was 5 and she was 3, I should have known better. You're ruining her special moment, I said, grabbing the AirPods out of my hands. Her special moment. I burst out into laughter, pointing to the cake. This is my birthday. Moira is quite literally 4 months away. Funny how all this sharing stuff only applies when it's my birthday. I mean, go ahead. Name one time Moira had to share her party. Nothing. Complete silence. Yeah, that's what I thought. Last year, her sweet 16 had a professional photographer. The year before, you rented the country club. Before that, the pool party with the DJ. When has she ever had to share? I grabbed a cake cutter and started slicing up pieces and placing them on paper plates to hand out to guests. It's not fair, Moira screamed. It's not fair. It's not fair. I shrugged at her little tantrum. I mean, you're absolutely right, Moira. It's not fair. It never was. Grandma stood up from her chair. I think we've seen enough. In fact, for 18 years, we've seen too much disparity and treatment and it's sickening. My auntie agreed. You're the parents. You're not supposed to play favorites. This is a family matter. Dad interrupted. We are family and we're done watching this happen every year, my uncle said, before turning to me with a soft smile. We should have done this before. I'm so sorry, dear. They gave me a tight hug, the warmest hug I've had in years. Moira freaked out seeing everyone suddenly turning against her and ran out of the room sobbing. Mom and dad quickly followed after her. Well, now I know you've already cut the cake, but you at least deserve one moment, my auntie said, placing one lit candle onto a small slice. And for the first time in my life, people sang Happy Birthday just for me. I moved in with my grandparents that night. The video my friends took of Moira's tantrum spread through the school the following week. Moira had a breakdown when none of our relatives showed up to her birthday party months later. But I made sure to send her a gift of my own, a birthday cake with my name written neatly in cursive and hers awkwardly misspelled.

Right. And I always end up paying it. She blinked like she hadn't understood the words. You don't have to make a big thing out of it. It's not a big thing, I said. Just separate checks. Easier for everyone. Jessica shifted in her seat. It's not about money. It's about family. I wanted to laugh. That line was their favorite excuse for everything. Borrowing, demanding, expecting. Exactly, I said. So we can act like family, not customers. The rest of dinner was quiet, which was fine by me. I enjoyed my food. I savored every bite like it was the first peaceful meal I'd had with them in months. When dessert came, my mom made one last attempt. You sure you don't want to just put it all together? I'll Venmo you later like last time, I said, smiling. You still owe me from that one. Her mouth opened, then closed. When the server brought the checks. I pulled out my card before anyone could blink. The look on my brother's face when he realized he'd actually have to pay for his steak was pure art. Jessica whispered something under her breath about tacky behavior, but I ignored her. As the server left, I noticed mom fumbling with her wallet. She wasn't used to it. Paying her own Bill. She. It looked smaller somehow. But for the first time, I didn't feel guilty. Then something happened that made it even better. The server came back and placed The receipts down. My dad squinted at his and said, wait, these prices don't seem right. Turns out the bistro had a promotion that night. Half off entrees for tables with separate checks. I hadn't known that. When I asked. Watching the realization dawn on their faces was glorious. My meal cost half what it usually did. So did theirs. My brother stared at me like I'd planned the whole thing. Maybe I had, in spirit. That night, my brother texted me. You embarrassed mom. I replied. She embarrassed herself when she kept treating me like an ATM. He didn't answer. Now I wonder if I did wrong. After all, they are my family. Am I the wrong one here?

Not through Brandon. Brandon was clearly losing his patience now. She did tell you through me. Sabrina was crying now, silent tears streaming down her face while my mom tried to pull me aside. You're upsetting her. Stop this right now. I planted my feet firmly in front of the door, not moving an inch. Sabrina, do you wanna go home with Brandon? Sign it directly to me. Sabrina lifted her hand slowly and started with her right hand and froze completely. She looked at Brandon like she was asking for permission to continue. Brandon smiled, but his eyes had gone completely cold and dead. Go ahead, babe. Sabrina's hands dropped to her sides and she sobbed harder, her whole body shaking violently. That's when Brandon went completely still, staring at Sabrina with an expression I'd never seen before. The warmth vanished entirely from his face. Sabrina, look at me now. She looked up at him. He signed something sharp and fast and angry. She shook her head violently in response. He signed again, slower this time, more deliberate and threatening. Back into the wall behind her. Trapped. My dad saw the complete change in Brandon's expression and body language. Brandon, what did you just sign to her? Brandon ignored him completely. His focus locked on Sabrina. We're leaving. He grabbed Sabrina's arm, hard and possess, leaving no room for argument. I shoved his hand off her. Don't touch her! Brandon's voice turned ice cold. Get out of my way. No more mask. No more pretending. The nice guy was completely gone. That's when Sabrina's hands started moving. Both hands signing frantically, words pouring out. My mom gasped, started translating through tears. Six months of isolation, Brandon monitoring everything. Every text, call, email, telling her what to wear, eat, when to sleep. He'd been using his ASL to lie for her, changing her words when he interpreted, to make her sound happy. My dad grabbed Brandon, shoved him toward the door. Brandon looked back at Sabrina with dead eyes. You're nothing without me. My dad threw him out. Lock the door. Brandon's car screeched away. Sabrina collapsed on the couch, still signing. Bruises covered both arms. Brandon had hidden her hearing aids, isolated her from the deaf community, bought a ring to propose next month and trap her permanently. Her hands finally stopped, and she looked at me, exhausted. I didn't think you'd remember. We were kids. My mom held Sabrina tight. We should have seen it. My dad checked the locks. I'm sorry. Sabrina leaned into them. Finally safe. I sat beside her on the couch. 23 years I'd waited for that signal, secretly hoping I'd never see it. But when it came, I'd been ready.

Then leave. I looked in the mirror, stage makeup still in, my eyebrows, tie too tight. I walked out, found Marco at the bar. Take my card off the account. What? Bianca swooped in. What now? My card is off your wedding, I said. And I'm not mcing. Heads turned. Mom stood, voice sharp. Leonardo, not tonight. Exactly, I said. Tonight the Bill hits Friday. Silence. Fork stopped midair.

Mom's face went cold. If you walk now, don't show up Saturday. I looked at Maura. She nodded once. This isn't revenge, I said quietly. This is closure. Then I walked to the front desk. Delete my card, I told the manager. He typed, hit a key. Click. This sound was tiny and final. At home, I opened the banking app, paused one auto pay, then another, then every Single, one phone plan, cake, insurance streaming. Ten minutes later, I was free. My phone lit up. Dad, is your card declining? Mom, the venue says payment failed. What's happening? Bianca? Oh, my god! Did you really? Then a screenshot of a payment failure notice decorated with confetti emojis. I put my phone face down. The triplets were asleep. I kissed their foreheads. I don't have to fund disrespect, I whispered. I already have a family. The next morning, 12 voicemails. Dad, fix this! Mom, you humiliated us! Bianca uninvited. Marco, bro, chill. I called the phone carrier. Separate my account, I said. The rep said, people get mad when you do this. I can take it. The wedding day came. We packed snacks, a soccer ball and three superhero capes. While they toasted under chandeliers, we picnicked in the park. The kids danced to our playlist called Household Bops. Stranger's dog joined. At noon, my phone buzzed. Group chat exploding. You ruined everything! The cake's late, the photographer's leaving! I muted it. Nico kicked the ball and fell laughing. The sound was better than any applause I've ever had.

At 3 p m, I invited them over. Mother, sister, niece. Three generations of entitlement in one elevator ride. When they entered my apartment, their faces said everything. Shock, fury, fear. I gestured to the table. Folders, bank statements, screenshots. The receipts of my generosity. Vanessa slammed her purse down. You humiliated us. No, I said quietly. You did that yourselves. I slid a folder toward her. That's every dollar I've given you for the past five years. Her eyes flicked over the numbers. You make it sound like charity. She spat. It was then to Sophia. I turned my tablet toward her. Her post, the comments, the video. Was this a joke, too? She stared at the screen, lips trembling. I. Everyone posts stuff like that. Not everyone attacks their own family online, eyes filled with tears. I'm sorry. You're sorry because the car is gone? I turned to my mother. When she threw that drink, you comforted her. She was upset, she said weakly. So was I. But you didn't comfort me. No one spoke. You've taken from me For years, I continued. Money, time, respect. Given. All of it. And you've given nothing back. Vanessa crossed her arms. So what now? You just cut us off completely? You can't do that. I already did, Sophia whispered. What about college? That fund is still there, I said. For education only. Not clothes, not gas, not ego. My mother's voice cracked. You're punishing your family. Setting boundaries, I said. For the first time, silence filled the room. Heavy, final. I stood. We're done here. They didn't move, so I opened the door. Vanessa grabbed her purse. You'll regret this. Maybe, I said. But not tonight. My mother hesitated in the doorway. Natalie, please. I met her eyes, calm, unflinching. Goodbye, mom. They left. Door clicked shut behind them. I walked to the window. Chicago lights glowed against the lake.

The call started immediate. Lee. Margaret. Margaret! Amy. I didn't answer. Grandmother walked me down the aisle. After the reception, there were 47 missed calls and one voicemail from Amy, sobbing. Mom's having a breakdown. She's saying grandma will ruin everything. The next day, Margaret showed up, furious. You had no right. She's a dementia patient. I placed medical documents on the table. She has mild memory issues, not severe dementia. You lied to control her assets. I have bank records. Hundreds of thousands withdrawn over 10 years. I pulled out the USB drive footage of you visiting monthly, making her sign papers while telling her I'd abandoned her. I showed her the email chain. Proof you paid Doctor Morrison to falsify her diagnosis. Margaret's face went white. Two options. One, criminal charges for fraud, elder abuse and financial exploitation. Two, return grandmother's assets and sign over guardianship to me. Amy started crying. We'll go bankrupt. You were already bankrupt. Just living on stolen money. Amy's voice shook. Mom said grandma wanted it This way. I looked at my sister. She lied to both of us. Grandma missed her granddaughter's. Mom kept us away so we wouldn't discover. The doubt flickered across Amy's face. Margaret chose option two. Three months later, grandmother moved into a cottage near our house. She volunteers at the senior center twice a week. Margaret and Amy lost everything. The apartment, the lifestyle, Amy's job. They were invited to Christmas dinner last year. They came quiet and humble. Grandmother raised her glass. To real family. The kind you choose. I held Jason's hand. My other hand rested on my stomach. Three months pregnant. I hadn't told anyone yet, but I would tonight. Some families are born. Some are built. Mine was built from the ashes of the one that abandoned me.

Everyone smiled through dessert, waited for the check, and then my mom would slide it across the table like a hand off in a relay race. You've got this right, she'd say, voice syrupy, sweet, already halfway out of her seat. I'd laugh it off the first time, then the second. By the third, it wasn't funny anymore. It wasn't about the money, though. Paying for six adults and two kids while juggling rent and student loans wasn't nothing. It was about the expectation. Somewhere along the line, I'd stopped being a daughter or sister and become the default wallet. It started subtly when I got promoted last year. They all said we needed to celebrate properly. I chose a modest Italian place, thinking it'd be nice. The Bill came. Mom made that hand off motion. I paid. Then they congratulated me for being so generous. After that, it became a tradition, except no one asked, just picked restaurants, assuming I'd cover it. My brother once ordered a second bottle of wine before I even arrived. When I raised an eyebrow, he said, it's your Celebration, too, isn't it? So I planned ahead for the next dinner. It was Mom's idea, a family catch up night. I said sure, even though every part of me clenched at the thought of another $300 disappearing from my account. I decided that this time I'd handle it differently. We met at a new bistro. Downtown, my mom waved like I've been gone for years. My brother's wife, Jessica, kissed my cheek and immediately asked if I'd finally paid off my car. My dad nodded, pretending not to hear. I smiled through it all. I even complimented Jessica's outfit. She smirked and said, you could totally wear something like this if you didn't spend all your money on Rent. Classic. When the server came for drink orders, I leaned in and said, oh, and can we do separate checks tonight, please? The silence was so sharp it made the server hesitate. My brother let out a short, surprised laugh. My mom's fork froze halfway to her mouth. The server nodded, scribbled something and left. Mom recovered first. Honey, that's silly. We always just do one check.

My sister grabbed the phone. Why make a fuss? Your marriage will probably fail anyway. Then she said, besides, Grandma Eleanor would have told you not to marry him anyway. Good thing she can't.

Mom claimed she had severe dementia, couldn't have visitors, was in some restricted facility. I called my lawyer friend. Within hours, we found her. Riverside Care center.

The facility manager looked uncomfortable. Your mother said Eleanor has severe dementia. But she doesn't. She has mild memory issues. He hesitated. She's been asking about you for years. Your mother told us you'd moved abroad and wanted no contact. The lie went both ways. The white haired woman by the window turned. Her eyes were sharp, clear. Olivia, she whispered. We held each other and cried. I explained everything. A mom told her I'd abandoned her grandmother's face darkened. She lied about my condition to control my assets. She's been using my retirement money for years. She pulled out a hidden envelope. Bank statements, forged signatures. I knew you'd come eventually. The luxury apartment, Amy's designer clothes, the vacations. All funded by stolen money.

Trevor steps in. You're threatened. You're unemployed. I'm disgusted. Did he says, I love her. Then pay for her. I'm between opportunities. You're between delusion and homelessness. She tried to get the house. Claimed it was for the future. Kids. What kids? I asked, trying. Judge goes. While still married to him. She says yes. Judge request denied. She screams again. She moved Trevor into my house, changed the locks. I filed an emergency motion. Got her evicted in 48 hours. Moving day, full meltdown. She tried to take my 75 inch TV. Said she needed it for her comfort. Trevor tried to carry my sound system out. A cop I hired told him to put it down. He did, real fast. Then she tried to take my grandma's antique dining set. I need it for the babies. There are no babies. There will be. Then Trevor can buy furniture. She cried again. Said I was heartless. You wanted to raise another man's children and expected me to fund the fantasy. She screamed, Trevor, Tried to flex. I stared him down. He backed up like a scared poodle. A week later, she showed up at my work. Security called me down. She looked rough. Unwashed hair. Same hoodie from 3 days ago. I'm pregnant. With Trevor's baby? Yes. Congratulations. We need help. No, you need a reality check. You could still be a father figure. I laughed so hard, the security guard covered his face. Then she begged, please don't leave me like this. You left me the second you picked Trevor. She stormed off two weeks later. Not pregnant, her sister told me. Said she got her period and sobbed for three days. Trevor gone. Took $5,000 and bounced. Left a note. Need to find myself. She called crying. He left me. I have nothing. You picked him. She sent a Christmas card. Photo of her beside a sad tree, thinking of better times. I didn't reply. She wanted to follow her heart. Cool. It LED her to a one bedroom apartment, a maxed out credit card and zero. Trevor

I came straight from work and saw my kids sitting on the floor with paper plates while my sister's children ate at the decorated table. Mom said they're used to leftovers. My sister smirked, you should be grateful they got anything. I didn't say a word. I looked at the next mortgage payment and just tapped cancel. I'm the dependable one. I'm an architect. My wife Maya teaches third grade. We have Liam, 8, and Emma, 5. My sister Sophia is the golden child. She posts about slow living. Her kids wear coordinated outfits. Mine wear hand me downs. Her ballet shoes were a priority. My cleats were maybe next month. Her bedroom got a mural. Mine got lectures. I said, yes, a lot. The help started 14 months ago. Mom called. Their mortgage rate jumped. Dad had dental work. Sophia's checks were delayed. I set up a recurring transfer, $1,050 monthly. Then utilities. Then Sophia's minivan breaks $187. Then soccer fees, piano lessons, boat storage. Maya asked why we couldn't afford new tires. I said we were helping family. She went quiet. Children's day fell on a Tuesday. My parents turned it into grandkids day. I came from a sidewalk still in dusty boots. The front yard had balloons inside, smelled like cinnamon. The dining table had a white runner, gold cutlery and four name cards, Max, Ivy, Sophia M. There were daisies and a throne chair with a sash. My kids weren't there. I found them in the living room, backs against the sofa, sitting on carpet with paper plates, crusted macaroni, a curled hot dog, two grapes. Max and Ivy were in the dining room eating chicken cutlets from real plates. There were cupcakes with sugar crowns, four of them. Why are you guys out here? I asked lightly. Emma shrugged. Grandma said it's the kids zone. Liam didn't look up. I was concentrating on cutting the hot dog with a plastic fork that kept bending. I walked into the kitchen. Mom turned with a bright smile. Arnold, you made it. Take your boots off, sweetheart. I glanced at the table again. Where should I seat Liam and Emma? Mom waved a hand. They're fine in there, less mess. Besides, they're used to leftovers. The word landed like a small stone, leftovers. Sophia leaned against the counter, perfect hair, holding a stemless glass of wine. She smirked. You should be grateful they got anything. I looked at Liam, still sawing at the hot dog. Emma had her little knees tucked under her, watching the cupcakes like stars.

My ex is joining us for Christmas dinner. Be mature about it. My wife Sarah said this three weeks before Christmas, not asking, telling. I looked up from my coffee. Your ex, Marcus? Yes. He's going through a hard time. I want to support him as a friend on Christmas with my family, our family, she corrected. And yes, be an adult about this, David. Something in her tone made my jaw clench. The way she said be an adult, like I was a child throwing a tantrum. Marcus, her college boyfriend, the one she stayed friends with, the one whose texts made her smile in ways mine didn't anymore. Fine, I said calmly. If Marcus is coming, that's okay. She looked surprised, relieved. Really? Thank you for understanding, I smiled. Of course, it's Christmas. The more the merrier. What Sarah didn't know was that I had Marcus's fiance's phone number. I'd found it two months ago when Sarah left her laptop open. Messenger conversation with Marcus, lots of messages, late night messages, I miss you messages, mentions of Jessica, his fiance, the woman he was supposedly committed to. While texting my wife, I called Jessica the next day. Hi, this is David. I'm Sarah's Husband, I think we should talk. She, it was quiet for a long moment. Then about the messages. You know, I suspected found some texts he deleted. He said they were just friends. He's coming to our Christmas dinner. Sarah invited him. Another pause. Without telling me, Wanna come too meet the family? See what just friends looks like. She was silent. Then. What time should I arrive? Christmas Day came. My parents, sister and nephew arrived first, then Sarah's mom. The table looked perfect. Turkey, ham, all the sides, 14 place settings. Sarah kept checking her phone. Marcus is running late. No worries, I said. Carving the Turkey. We have time. The doorbell rang. Sarah practically jumped up. That's him. She opened the door. Marcus stood there.

He thought everyone would laugh, but a judge in the crowd stood up and changed everything. I'm 35. Until six months ago, I thought my family dynamic was normal. Sibling rivalry, parents who played favourites, the usual stuff. I was the responsible one who worked dock shifts at 16 while my younger brother Liam partied through high school. When I bought a yacht years later, my parents finally cared, but not in the way I'd hoped. Liam's 30th second charismatic. Our parents called him their golden boy. When he got engaged to Tessa, an influencer obsessed with aesthetics, trouble started the first time we met. She said your yacht would make killer wedding footage. I laughed. She wasn't joking. For months, Liam kept dropping hints. We'll do the rehearsal dinner on Noah's boat, right? He never asked. Just assumed I built that yacht, the Mariner's Wish, from scratch. It was my business. When I said I couldn't take it offline for a wedding weekend, he shrugged me off. Then my mom called. Honey, he's not asking for money, just a favor. You can't put a price tag on family memories. I gave in a little. They could use the yacht for photos, one hour supervised, Liam agreed to quickly. A month before the wedding, he texted, hey, bro, Tessa and I decided we'll have the ceremony on The mariner's wish. Everyone's hyped. No question Mark, no discussion. When I called him, he laughed. Dude, think of it like marketing. Half our guests have massive followings. I told him no. He hung up on me. The morning of the ceremony, my employee texted, boss, there's a team at the dock loading flowers onto your yacht. I drove straight there. Liam was directing the setup, speakers, champagne towers, decorations. When he saw me, he didn't look surprised. He looked prepared, like he'd been expecting this confrontation. What are you doing? I asked. Relax, he said. We'll put everything back. You don't have permission. He laughed. You'd really ruin your brother's wedding because you can't lend him a boat. I forced them to unload everything. Liam stormed off. He didn't speak to me again before the wedding. At the ceremony, people whispered. My mom muttered, please don't make a scene. Then came Liam's speech. Before we wrap up, I wanna say a few words about my brother, Noah. The crowd clapped politely. Noah's the responsible one.

You were never in the will anyway. My sister laughed. Good. He just wasted. I took a sip of wine and said, cool. Hope you enjoy the cash since I'm the one who bought it. The table went silent. I've always been the family scapegoat. While my golden child sister Jenna got everything and baby brother Tyler could do no wrong, I was invisible. The only person who ever saw me was Grandma Lorraine. Growing up, holidays at her house were my sanctuary. She'd save me the last scoop of mashed potatoes while my parents rolled their eyes at everything I said. When she died during my senior year, my parents didn't tell me the funeral was moved up. I found out from a voicemail. It was a small family thing. Mom. Mom said everyone was grieving. It wasn't about you. For years, I built a life that didn't need them. Moved west, got into software, climb the ladder quietly. I get the occasional group text or late birthday message, but I kept my distance. Then last year, a friend texted me, saw a for sale sign on your grandma's old place. That sucks. I called mom immediately. You're selling grandma's house. We were meaning to tell you. You're so busy in California, we didn't think you'd be interested. Something snapped that night. I'd spent too long letting this family decide what I deserve. I called the Realtor. Used My middle name Spencer and toured the house as a fake investor. My heart cracked walking through those rooms, but I made an offer through a shell company I own. I didn't tell anyone Christmas was coming. Jenna's group text arrived. Christmas dinner at mom and Dad's seven PM, formal attire, big news. I showed up in a charcoal suit, wine in hand. Tyler was drunk. Jenna was scrolling her phone in gold sequence. And my parents were buzzing around like they own the world. Dinner started normal. Then mom looked up gleefully. Oh, we finally sold Grandma's house just last week. Thank God. Jenna laughed about time and Noah was never in the will anyway. Tyler chuckled. Good. He probably turned into some weird tech bunker. I set my glass down slowly watching the people who always assumed I'd stay quiet. I picked up my wine, took a sip and said, cool. Hope you enjoy the cash since I'm the one who bought it. Dead silence. Mom's face froze. Jenna blinked, confused. Tyler furrowed his brow. Wait, what do you mean? Jenna laughed nervously. I bought Grandma's house through Spencer Holdings. That's my company. Dad leaned forward. Don't be ridiculous. The buyers were from out of state.

So I started having my own accidents with my ex until his little game blew up. My husband Ryan had this interesting habit of accidentally texting his ex girlfriend Kayla. The first accident happened three months after our wedding. He sent her a photo of our newly painted kitchen with the caption, finally got around to painting. When I saw her name on his phone screen, he grabbed it quickly. That was meant for my brother. They're next to each other in my contacts. Sure. K for Kevin, K for Kayla. Easy mistake. Two weeks later, another accident. a photo of our German Shepherd with someone's getting spoiled today. I only knew because Kayla responded, ah, Duke looks so happy. And the notification popped up during dinner. Duke, I asked. That's what she used to call him when we dated. I forgot to change his name in the caption, total muscle memory. You dated 3 years ago? Yeah. Weird how the brain works. The brain worked weirdly a lot. He accidentally sent her a screenshot of concert tickets. Accidentally replied to her Instagram story about a new bakery with their croissants are incredible. Accidentally liked a photo from 47 weeks back while clearing his cash. Why is she even in your phone, I asked. After accident No. 6, a voice memo about traffic that somehow landed in her inbox. I don't Delete contacts. The thing like keeping old birthday cards. You throw away birthday cards immediately. Different kind of collecting. The restaurant incident made me snap. Kayla posted about this new sushi place downtown and Ryan commented, we've been dying to try that place. Let us know how it is. We, me, us. Like we were some trouble planning dinner dates. It was a typo, he said. When I confronted him. I meant to write, I've been dying to try it. We is not a typo for Ive Autocorrect. Ryan, you're making this bigger than it is. She's engaged to someone else. Check her profile. I did check. She was engaged to a man named Christopher who looked like he sold insurance and enjoyed profit. That should have been reassuring. Instead, I noticed something else. Every accident matched her posts. She posted about home renovations. He accidentally sent renovation photos. She posted about missing dogs. Duke got accidentally photographed. She posted about concerts. Tickets appeared in her messages. You're stuck.

Three years later, they saw my face on a highway billboard and begged to meet. The morning of my wedding, I stood alone in the bridal room, checking my phone. No messages, no missed calls, nothing. Four weeks earlier, my mom called while I was finalising catering. Rachel, honey, we can't make it to your wedding. Her voice had that tone for inconvenient news. Lily's boyfriend is proposing next month. They're going to Miami, and we offered to help arrange things. I gripped the phone tighter. You're skipping my wedding for a proposal that hasn't even happened yet? Don't be dramatic. Ryan's family owns a financial firm. His parents chartered a yacht for the proposal weekend and invited us. It would be rude to decline. So you're choosing Lily's boyfriend's parents over your own daughter's wedding? Mom sighed like I was exhausting her. Your wedding is quite simple anyway. Ethan's parents are already paying for most of it. Right. Besides, if you dated Ryan when he showed interest before Lily did, you could have had the yacht proposal. Those words burned. Simple like my wedding was embarrassing. Margaret, Ethan's mom, found me crying in the bridal suite. When I explained, she squeezed my hands. Thomas and I couldn't be happier to have you join our family. The ceremony was perfect. 60 guests instead of 64. Ethan's father walked me down the aisle. We danced under market lights with people Who chose to celebrate with us? But those four empty chairs haunted me. After the honeymoon, I threw myself into work. I've been developing a wellness app called Zenita. Holistic Health Tracking that actually worked. The rejection from my family became fuel. Every late night coding, every investor pitch, every small victory felt like proof I didn't need their approval. Eighteen months later, we secured Series B funding. $28 million. Six months after that, Zanita hit 10 million downloads. Then came the billboard campaign. My face appeared on a massive billboard off Interstate 76.

I barely use Instagram. Then how do you accidentally respond to her stories within minutes? The algorithm shows them first. The algorithm, yeah. It knows we used to interact, so it prioritizes her content. It's computer science. I'm a software developer. Ryan, that's not how it works. He got defensive, then started saying I was paranoid, insecure, that maybe I needed to talk to someone about my trust issues. Classic redirect, make me the problem. So we don't discuss his accidents. Fine. You could play the accident game. I started having my own. Accidentally texted my ex, Brandon, a photo of my new running shoes. Wrong person, I said. When Ryan saw Brandon's next to Brenda in my contacts. Accidentally commented on Brandon's LinkedIn post about his promotion. Finger slipped while scrolling. Accidentally sent him our dinner reservation confirmation meant for my mom. Ryan lost it after the 4th accident. This is obviously on purpose. You're trying to make some point. Accidents happen. You said so yourself. This is different. You're being vindictive. How is it different? Explain exactly how my accidents are different from yours because mine actually were accidents. Prove it. I don't have to prove anything. You either trust me or you don't. Funny how that only applies to your accidents. The real kicker came two weeks later. I ran into Kayla at target, recognized her from the excessive Instagram stalking I've been doing. You're Ryan's wife, she said, looking Uncomfortable. I am. Look, this is awkward, but could you tell him to stop? The texts, the comments. Christopher's getting upset. He said they were accents. She laughed, not kindly, right? Like the accident where he asked if I ever thought about what could have been. Or the accident where he said he drove past our old apartment and got emotional. My chest went cold. He said that three weeks ago at 1:00am, very accidentally, I'm sure. I went home and packed a bag. Ryan found me in the bedroom. Where are you going? My sister's accidentally meant to go to the grocery store, but muscle memory took me to her house instead. That doesn't make sense. Neither does accidentally asking your ex about what could have been. Face went white. You talked to Kayla, accidentally ran into her. Funny how accidents happen. Let me explain. No need. I'm sure your next wife will find your accidents charming. Next wife, we can work through this. We could have 3 months ago, but you chose to keep having accidents instead. I left him standing there, probably already composing his next accidental text to Kayla about how his marriage accidentally ended.

She lets them break in while she was watching. So I called the C O. P. S and got her arrested. I bought my first house in April after saving for eight years. Nothing special, a two bedroom ranch built in the 70s. But it had something I dreamed about since childhood, a kidney shaped pool in the backyard. The previous owner, an elderly man named Frank had died last year and his kids sold it below market. Because the house needed work, I spent every weekend fixing it up, painting walls, replacing fixtures and getting that pool ready for summer. The first sign of trouble came in may. I was cleaning the pool filter when I noticed toys floating in the deep end, deflated unicorn float, diving sticks, goggles. Figured the wind blew them in from a neighbour's yard, threw them in the trash and forgot about it. Next weekend, more toys. This time a basketball hoop attached to my pool edge that definitely wasn't there before I removed it. Starting to get annoyed. Then came Memorial Day. I invited my sister and her family over for a barbecue. My first real hosting since buying the place we we're setting up when my five year old nephew started screaming there were three kids already in the pool, ages maybe 8 to 12, just swimming like they owned it. No adults in Sight. I told them to get out immediately, that this was private property. The oldest one, a boy with bleached tips in his hair, actually laughed. Frank always let us swim. We've been coming here for four years. They took their time getting out, deliberately splashing water on my deck chairs, then hopped my fence and disappeared. 20 minutes later, a woman was pounding on my front door so hard I thought she'd break it. Diane, she introduced herself, lived three houses down, started screaming before I could speak. How dare I kick out her children? They've been swimming in that pool since they were little. Frank had given them permanent permission. I explained Frank was dead. I own the house now and nobody had permission to enter my property. He actually said you can't just change the rules. They have routines. My son has anxiety and swimming helps him cope. I suggested the community center two miles away. She sneered and said the chemicals there gave him rashes. Her kid's skin condition was apparently my problem to solve. Over the next two weeks, I caught them twice more, once at 6 in the.

Another time, I came home from work early with a migraine and found five kids in there, music blasting from a speaker they brought. Diane had given them copies of my gate key. Somehow I had a locksmith come that day, installed a digital lock, only I had the code for. Put up no trespassing signs, installed a ring camera. The woman lost her mind. She started a neighbourhood Facebook group post about how I was discriminating against children, destroying community spirit. Probably a bitter, childish person who hated joy. Her friends piled on, calling me heartless, selfish, asking, what kind of person denies kids innocent fun? Last Tuesday was the final straw. I woke up at 2:00am to voices and laughter. Looked outside and there were at least 10 teenagers in my pool, beer cans on my deck, someone's Bluetooth speaker playing music that would definitely get me a noise complaint. But here's what really got me. Diane was there in a lawn chair she'd brought, supervising this party in my backyard. I called the police immediately. While waiting, I turned on every exterior light and my sprinkler system, which I conveniently aimed at the pool deck. After the last intrusion, the party scattered, but Diane stayed, now soaking wet, screaming about assault. The officers arrived to find her still in my backyard, refusing to leave, demanding I be arrested for attacking her with water. They asked for her I D ran it and found she had an outstanding warrant for unpaid tickets. As they put her in the patrol car, she screamed that I'd ruined her kids summer, that Frank would be disgusted by my selfishness, that the neighborhood would make my life hell. Her husband came to get the kids, apologizing profusely, admitting he told her to stop months ago, but she wouldn't listen. Turns out Frank never gave permission. His daughter contacted me after seeing the police report. Frank had complained about the trespassing for years, but was too frail to enforce it. He died stressed about those kids drowning in his pool and him being liable. Diane made up the permission story after he died, figuring a new owner wouldn't know. I had a 6 foot privacy fence installed last week. It's me 5,000 I hadn't budgeted for. The installer said it was the third one he put up in this neighborhood this year, all because of Diane's community pool philosophy. Sometimes good fences really do make good neighbors.

I called my best friends, pretending I was drowning in debt. One told me it was karma. Another said, you're not my problem. But my childhood friend drove 4 hours to help me move my stuff. What I did next changed his entire future. My name is Connor. I'm 31, and I just sold my cyber security software to a Fortune 500 company for $90 Million after taxes. I built it alone in my garage for three years. Nights, I worked at a data center, making $19 an hour. Days, I coded until my eyes burned. No investors, no press. Just me, caffeine, and a dream that felt impossible. Most mornings, the wire hit my account. On a Tuesday at 2:47 p m, I was sitting in a Wendy's parking lot eating a $5 meal when my phone buzzed. I read the number three times, and I put my head on the steering wheel and just breathed. I didn't call my mom, didn't post online, didn't tell anyone. Because I realized something. Sitting there with my cold fries, I had no idea who actually cared about me versus who cared about what I could do for them. For three years, I'd been the broke friend, the one who couldn't make bachelor parties or split Airbnbs. People stopped inviting me to things. I told myself it was normal. Life gets busy. But now, with more money than I'd ever imagined. I needed to know the truth, so I designed a test. I made a list of three people I'd known since college, people I'd helped, trusted, considered close. I wrote a simple script. Hey, I'm in trouble. My landlord's evicting me, and I need help moving my stuff by Friday. Can you spare a few hours? That's it? No money involved? Just time and effort. Thursday morning, I called Derek first. Derek and I met freshman year. We were roommates for two years. I'd covered his rent twice when he was between jobs. I driven him to the airport at 4:00am more times than I could count.

We were dramatic kids who watched too many spy movies, but we shook on it. Pinky promise promised left hand equals help me. 23 years and she'd never used it once. Every Sunday dinner would be at my parents house. Sabrina arrived with Brandon, my childhood best friend, everyone's favorite. He'd Learned ASL to date her and my parents called him their bonus son. At the table, Sabrina barely ate. While Brandon cut her food without asking. She kept her eyes down the entire meal, shrinking into herself. After dessert, she hugged me goodbye and her left hand came up to sign I love you. My Spidey sense tingled. She pulled back fast, refusing to meet my eyes. Brandon appeared beside her, signing and speaking simultaneously. I grabbed her arm and she flinched hard. Stay longer, I said. Brandon laughed. That easy laugh everyone trusted. Three hours is enough, man. I looked directly at Sabrina, ignoring him. Do you want to stay? She glanced at Brandon first before shaking her head. And that one glance told me everything I needed to know. I didn't let go of her arm. I'm asking her, not you. My dad walked over from the kitchen. What's going on? Sabrina signed with her right hand. I'm fine. But the hand trembled visibly. Brandon squeezed her shoulder and she went completely rigid, her face draining of all colour. This girl who used to argue with everyone just stood there silent and terrified. My mom appeared from the dining room. What's happening? I stared at my sister, really seeing her for the first time tonight. She lost 20 pounds, wore long sleeves in July, had dark circles under her eyes. I need to talk to Sabrina alone. My mom's face hardened instant. After everything Brandon has done for this family, Brandon held up his hands in that haughty gesture everyone loved so much. Sabrina, do you want to talk to your brother alone? Sabrina looked at him, then at me, then shook her head. She was too scared to say yes. Show me your arms, Sabrina. The room went complete silent. Everyone frozen. Take off the sweater. My dad stepped toward me. You don't get to demand anything. If everything's fine, she can show me, I said, holding my ground. Brandon's voice stayed eerily calm. You're being crazy. Sabrina turned to Brandon and signed something desperate and fast. He nodded, put his arm around her and started moving her toward the door. I stepped in front of them, blocking their path. Sabrina, look at me. She did for just one second. And in that second, I saw pure terror in her. Eyes. Brandon pulled her faster toward the exit. My dad's voice went hard and threatening. Move now. Not until Sabrina signs it herself.

But right before we drove off, I looked at him and said loud enough for my entire family to hear, actually, officer, can you take these cuffs off now? And he did it right there in the driveway in front of everyone. My sister's phone was still recording the whole thing.

My uncle said I was manipulative as hell and clearly had some serious mental issues going on. My mom said I'd broken her trust completely, forever, and how could she ever believe anything I say again? My dad threatened to cut me off from the family entirely so I wasn't welcome at any family events anymore starting right now. You can't disown someone you already abandoned, I said, looking straight at him. Then I turned to my girlfriend who was standing there still totally confused with her. Purse already open, ready to pull out her debit card to bail me out. You were ready to drain your entire savings account for me without even thinking about it twice, I said. Then I turned back to my family still standing around the grill with their plates. I've given you over $30,000 combined over the years, fixed all your problems, covered your rent, your car payments, your business loans, all your emergencies. But when I supposedly needed help, the biggest help of my life, you filmed it for social media content. I'm done being your backup plan. And my girlfriend and I walked her car together. My phone started blowing up before we even got home. Text calling me ungrateful, saying I was a cruel, voicemail saying I destroyed the family. My sister texted I was dead to her. My brother said I was being dramatic. My uncle said family doesn't test family. My parents said they raised me better. But my girlfriend grabbed my hand and said, you needed to know the truth. We're getting our own place next month and my family can bail themselves out next time.

My father materialized beside her. You look different, older. It's been 5 years, people age. My mother's voice cracked. Do you have any idea how much you've hurt us? The audacity nearly made me laugh. How much I've hurt you. You can't just disappear because of some silly grudge. Silly grudge. You skipped my seventh birthday from Madison's costume fitting. You missed my high school graduation where I was valedictorian because she had a dance competition. You refused to help with my college applications but bought her a car at 16.

Seven years ago, they made a choice to skip my MIT graduation for a ballet recital. That didn't matter.

That's how I ended up working at a massive electronics store, one of those places where the TVs all show the same movie trailer on loop and you can smell burnt coffee from three aisles away. I was in the home theater section, which basically meant I stood between giant screens all day pretending to be excited about cables and surround sound systems. My manager, Bob, not his real name, was actually a good guy. He was patient, organized, and probably too decent for the corporate circus he worked in. His boss, the general manager, Jim, was the opposite. Jim loved buzzwords, meetings and anything that made him sound like a visionary, even if it didn't make sense in the real world. Ails in our department were solid, not spectacular, but definitely good enough that no one should have been complaining. Still, Jim wanted growth. He wanted momentum. He wanted to ignite the customer experience, whatever that meant. Now, the reality was that I worked morning shifts and mornings in home theater were like standing in an empty art gallery. Maybe 10 customers walked through on a good day, and most of those 10 were just waiting for their spouses phone plan to get activated. In the mobile section, I could Have done cartwheels down the aisles and no one would have noticed. Even with that, I did pretty well. I listened to people, Learned what they actually needed and help them find the best option. Sometimes they walked out with something totally different than what they came in for, but they were happy and I barely ever had returns. I was good at my job, even if it didn't excite me. But apparently I wasn't good enough for Jim's new customer engagement initiative. One morning, Bob pulled me aside for a meeting. Jim wanted us to start using ice breakers. According to corporate training, people were more likely to buy from someone they liked personally. So we were supposed to make small talk, crack jokes, compliment their clothes, whatever it took to build rapport. I remember just staring at Bob and thinking, you've got to be kidding me. He knew how I felt about corporate nonsense like that. I liked being straightforward with customers, not running psychological experiments on them. Still.

When I first got that email summoning me to New York City for a meeting with the CEO and the board, I had no idea what was coming. I was a general troubleshooter for the company, based out of Ontario, handling both Canadian and US clients. My work took me across borders, often by car, since my schedule was unpredictable and flights were too costly. I love the job. Solving problems, meeting clients, fixing what others couldn't. My colleague Jim worked under me, but we operated more like equals. When Jim and I compared notes, we realised we'd both been called to the same meeting. No explanation, just a time and place. We met the night before for dinner and tried to guess what it was about, but nothing made sense. The next morning, we were LED into a boardroom where the CEO, Bob, and the directors were already waiting. Bob explained that our department would be split into two, one for Canada, one for the US. A new hire would handle the US clients, while we would stay north of the border. It caught us both off guard. No one had mentioned this before. When I asked who the new hire was, Bob smiled proudly and brought in Karen, a woman who couldn't have been older than 23. She walked in with an air of confidence that bordered on arrogance. Within minutes, she made it clear. She had no interest in learning from us. Bob introduced her as someone who would work alongside us, but her tone said otherwise. I already have some ideas to streamline operations and cut unnecessary expenses, she announced, glancing at us like we were part of those unnecessary expenses. The confusion in the room was thick. Even some board members looked uncomfortable. I turned to Bob and asked him to clarify her role. He smiled and said, Karen will be heading your department now. You'll both report directly to her. One of the board members interrupted immediately, that's not what we discussed. We agreed to divide the department, not replace existing leadership. Karen folded her arms. Well, I can work with that as long as they stay out of my way. That was the last straw. Bob ended the meeting abruptly, told us we were no longer to interact with Karen or any US clients. We were to focus solely on Canada. I asked for written confirmation, and sure enough, we got it by email later that day.

But not the way they expected. From that point on, I treated every customer like we were on a speed dating show. I'd greet everyone with a grin and a compliment. Nice shirt, man. You look like someone who knows good speakers when you hear them. And that outfit is totally giving movie star energy. Let's find you a TV that deserves it. I complimented everyone. Men, women, old, young, rich. Not rich. Everyone got a few seconds of charm. I even threw in celebrity comparisons when I could. The results were entertaining. Some people blushed, some laughed. A couple of bored housewives even gave me their phone numbers, which was awkward but hilarious. The problem was I was having too much fun chatting and not enough time actually selling. My department's numbers started dipping. Jim noticed. He wasn't thrilled that the guy who used to hit quota was now apparently running a social club in home theater. A week later, a secret shopper visited the store. I didn't know it at the time, but that was my last shift of freedom. A few days later, Bob came to me, trying not to laugh. You're not gonna believe this, he said. Jim's furious. The secret shopper report says you were too personal with customers. I raised an eyebrow. Too personal? I was just breaking the ice. Isn't that what he wanted? He slid a paper toward me. An official write up for unprofessional communication with customers. I couldn't help it. I burst out laughing. I refused to sign it. I told him straight I didn't break any rules, I didn't say anything inappropriate, and I followed the new directive to the letter. Then I added, but honestly, I'm putting in my two weeks anyway. If this write up's a deal breaker, I can leave now. Bob sighed. He wasn't mad. He looked more disappointed that I was leaving. Jim's gonna lose it, he said. I shrugged. He told me to use Ice Breakers. I just use the good ones. Jim was furious when he found out I was quitting. He called me one of the best salespeople they had, which was funny, because he spent half his time trying to fix what wasn't broken. Two weeks later, I turned in my badge, shook Bob's hand, and walked out with a grin. As I was leaving, he said, you know, you might have been the only person who actually did exactly what Jim said. I smiled. Guess I just understood the assignment. And with that, I left the store behind. My brief career as the department's most charming failure officially complete.

When my uncle died, they demanded millions. But the lawyer's secret clause left them with nothing. I was 13 when my parents decided I wasn't worth the trouble anymore. Not officially abandoned, just forgotten. They'd leave for days without groceries, without warning, without care. I Learned to make ramen stretch three days. I Learned which neighbors would pretend not to notice a skinny kid at their door. Learned that family means nothing when it's inconvenient. My Uncle Marcus was different. He'd show up unannounced with groceries. Twenty dollar bills pressed into my palm. Your parents are dealing with stuff, he'd say. But that's not your fault, kiddo. When I turned 16 and my parents moved two states away for Dad's new job, without asking if I wanted to come, Uncle Marcus didn't hesitate. You're staying with me. No discussion. He put me through high school, taught me to drive. Showed up to every graduation, every award ceremony. Every moment my parents couldn't be bothered to attend. When I got into college, he co signed my loans. When I graduated, he was front row, tears in his eyes. That's my boy, he kept saying. My parents, a Christmas card every few years. Text on my birthday if they remembered. When I got married, they didn't come. Too far, too expensive. You understand? Uncle Marcus walked me down the aisle. Last March, Uncle Marcus died suddenly. Heart attack at 68. I was destroyed. The funeral was small, just how we wanted. I gave the eulogy, barely holding it together. That's when I saw them. My parents, sitting in the back row, dressed in black, crying like they'd lost their best friend. After the service, my mother grabbed my arm. We need to talk about the estate. The house alone is worth 2.3 million. That's when my father chimed in. We're his closest living relatives. After you, of course. But family should share these things. I stared at them. You want his money? My mother's face hardened. Don't be selfish. He was our brother. We have rights. My father pulled out his phone. We already spoke to a lawyer. Blood relatives have a strong case if we contest. The reading of the will was scheduled for Friday. My parents showed up early, dressed like they were attending a business merger.

Five years later, at my cousin's wedding, they finally understood what they'd lost. I stood alone in my cap and gown on MIT's lawn in May 2018, scanning the crowd for faces I knew wouldn't be there. My phone buzzed. Mom's text. Sweetie, Madison's recital got moved to today. We'll make it up to you. Congratulations. 22 years old. Suma Kumlaude in computer engineering. Completely alone that evening, she called, voice bubbling with excitement. Madison was absolutely breathtaking. Everyone said she was the star. How was your little ceremony? My little ceremony? Four years of sleepless nights. Breakthrough in semiconductor design with actual patent potential. But it was my little ceremony. While Madison's Community Theatre Ballet recital was the event of the year, something inside me cracked. It was fine, mom. Oh, good. Do you want me to send you the video? I hung up. Then I blocked both their numbers, changed my email, disappeared completely. Through my uncle Robert, I heard fragments. They didn't even realize I was seriously upset for three weeks. She'll come around, my father said. Sarah's always been Moody. But I didn't come around. I took a position at a tech company in Seattle, 3,000 miles from Richmond, Virginia. The salary was ridiculous. More than my parents made combined. But they didn't know. The company's CEO had read my thesis. He'd flown to MIT specifically to recruit me. I threw myself into work, into Building a life where my achievements actually mattered. Five years passed. I got promoted twice. By 27, I was a senior engineer with my name on three patents. I bought an apartment overlooking Puget Sound. Then the biggest twist. My semiconductor design became the foundation for a product worth $40 million. My parents never knew because they never asked. I built a life that was entirely, completely mine. Then my cousin Derek's wedding invitation arrived.

They were fake boxes, old textbooks, kitchen junk I'd pulled from my garage. He never questioned it. We drove back in silence for the first hour. Then he bought me breakfast at a truck stop and said, you'll land on your feet, man. You always do. I almost told him, Right there. That afternoon, I called my lawyer and had her draft the paperwork. By Monday morning, Benji had a $2 million trust fund in his name, full college tuition covered for his two kids, and a 10% partnership offer in my next venture. I didn't make a big announcement. I just texted him, check your email, read everything. He called me 20 minutes later crying so hard he couldn't speak. When he finally got words out, he Said, Connor, what did you do? I'm just giving it to someone who showed up. I said, Derek and Vanessa found out 3 months later through a LinkedIn post. I didn't even write. My lawyer made it. Both sent long texts apologizing, asking to reconnect, saying they'd had a rough week back then. I left them unread.

You embarrassed yourself, I said. I just stopped covering for you. The breaking point came at parent teacher conferences. Grace's teacher said she was becoming wonderfully assertive. She stands up for herself and others. You must be proud. Vincent frowned. She's becoming difficult. No, the teacher said carefully. She's becoming confident.

He and the mistress just started stealing electricity from the neighbors and collecting rainwater. I'm not kidding. They were basically camping in a house in the middle of Bogota. Rather than admitting defeat. Two more years of this. Two years, Dad's paying property taxes on a house he can't use, can't sell, can't even visit without dealing with his squatter brother. Legal case is moving nowhere. Uncle's starting to tell people in the neighborhood that dad abandoned the house to live in El Norte. So now it's his. That's when dad finally snapped. He flew down to Colombia without telling anyone. Hired some local guys to watch the house. For weeks, they monitored when uncle and the mistress would leave, their patterns, their schedule. Turns out, every Thursday, they'd go to the market in Palo Comal and wouldn't come back until afternoon. One Thursday, dad made the call. The demolition crew was already waiting. The moment uncle's car disappeared down the road, they moved in. Excavator, bulldozer, the works. This wasn't some half hearted attempt. This was complete destruction. By the time uncle came back from the market, there was nothing left but rubble. The house our great grandfather built, the house where dad grew up, the house that had been in our family for generations. Gone. Just a pile of bricks and twisted metal. Uncle called dad, screaming in Spanish, then broken English, then back to Spanish. Threatening to sue, threatening to call the police, threatening to Fly to Arizona and fight him. Dad's response? Sue me for what? Demolishing my own house? Good luck with that. And you can't afford a plane ticket to anyway. And here's the beautiful part. Uncle couldn't do anything. The house was legally Dad's. All the paperwork was in Dad's name. Colombian law doesn't prevent you from demolishing your own property. Uncle wasn't a legal tenant. He was a squatter who dad had been trying to evict for years. Uncle tried going to the police, but what's he going to say? I was illegally living in my brother's house and he demolished it. They told him it was a civil matter and to get a lawyer. The mistress left him immediately. Turns out she was only with him for the free house in a nice neighborhood. No house, no mistress. The extended family was divided. The relatives in Columbia thought dad went too far. The relatives in the US understood why he did it.

Only three underclassmen made it that year. She came home waving the acceptance letter. Dad, I made varsity. I was standing in the hallway. The one covered floor to ceiling with photos of my late wife. Wedding pictures, her high school swim trophies, beach vacations. I'd spent two weekends building it. After the funeral, I looked at a photo of my wife teaching our daughter to swim when she was 3. Your mom would have been so proud. She taught you in that exact will, remember? My daughter's smile faded. Yeah, dad, I remember. She went to her room. I heard the door close. That became every single conversation. When she made honor roll, I showed her my wife's valedictorian plaque. When she won regionals, I pulled out a box of my wife's medals and spread them on the kitchen table. Look at these. This is what real dedication looks like. She just stared at them. When she asked me to come to parent teacher night, I said I couldn't. It was the anniversary of my wife's death. I needed to go to this cemetery. But, dad, it's only once a year. And it's my junior year. It matters. Your mom matters, too. I went to the grave instead. Sat there three hours talking to a headstone. My daughter ate microwave Mac and cheese alone. I thought I was keeping my wife's memory alive. I thought I was being a good husband. I didn't notice.

She ordered the same thing, same table. Actually, my daughter put her menu down. Dad, do you even know what place I got at regionals? I opened my mouth, nothing came out. Third place.

Everyone said I was insane. When my boyfriend, Pedro proposed, I saw an opportunity. You see, his girl best friend, Fiona, had been a pain in the neck the entire relationship. She had spread awful lies about me at the start, ruined a couple of dates by showing up uninvited, and even tried to accidentally kiss Pedro using some TikTok. But I dealt with mean girls before and high school taught me that sometimes the best way to expose someone is to give them exactly what they want and let them destroy themselves. So that's exactly what I did. When I told Pedro I'd really love it if Fiona planned our engagement party, my mom actually begged me not to do it. My best friend said I was setting myself up for disaster. But I just smiled and said, Pedro believes in her and I believe in Pedro. Maybe we'd all been misunderstanding her intentions. She deserves a chance to prove herself, I told them gently. And when we told Fiona, she was thrilled, of course, not knowing I was the one hanging the poisoned apple by a thread. The planning phase started pretty typically for Fiona. She showed up to our first meeting with invitation samples for the party, but they were drawn with crayon, clearly created to be ugly and unprofessional. My friends exchanged horrified looks, but I just smiled and started adding ribbons and pressed Flowers and old baby photos of Pedro and me onto the invites. Suddenly they looked adorable and unique. Fiona say so when everyone complimented them. Then came the venue booking. She'd somehow reserved the wrong date and ordered bland decorations. All problems I quickly fixed too. And soon people were starting to see the pattern. The engagement party itself was where things really escalated. Fiona had been in charge of the seating chart and strategically positioned herself between me and Pedro at the head table. I watched as people whispered and stared at her with confused expressions. Even Pedro's mom mentioned out loud that it was odd. I let the awkward tension stretch until it was absolutely painful. Then I finally spoke up with a bright smile and said, Fiona, you're so funny. We've switched our seats by accident, right? Fiona's face paled, suddenly being put on the spot. She quietly agreed and switched spots, but she still hadn't Learned her lesson. An hour in, Fiona got up to play the slideshow she had prepared. It was supposed to be about our relationship, but maybe 80% of it was just photos of her and Pedro growing up. I sat there with a pleasant expression the whole time. When it ended, I sat up clapping and said, wow.

Some people giggled, catching the sarcasm. Fiona looked hurt, but couldn't say anything until it was speech time, where she emphasized that she and Pedro weren't just friends, they were best friends. She ended her speech saying, I love you, Pedro, while making this intense eye contact that only made him want to crawl under the table and hide instead, even his mom had her hand over her mouth. The rest of the guests sat stiff in their seats, having a hard time hiding how much they hated her. But Fiona misread their stairs for admiration, and when she watched Pedro step away from me on the dance floor, she thought she had won him back. I watched her slip out to the hallway, hand on her phone, looking absolutely giddy, clearly bragging to her friend about the successful day. She was far enough away that she probably thought no one could hear her. That's when I sent one of my little nieces to go over there and hand Fiona a microphone. Little girl was so sweet about it. She approached Fiona and lightly tugged on her dress. Excuse me, miss, she said softly. Fiona didn't even look at her. She just rolled her eyes at the girl and said, don't you see I'm on the phone? The little girl stood there a while longer, waiting for the call to end, before tugging on Fiona's shirt again. This Time! Fiona harshly snapped at the kid to go away. The thing was, the microphone had been live the entire your time. The sound system had picked up everything from cursing out an innocent kid to telling her friends that Pedro was always hers. I've broken up three of his relationships before. I can do it again. When Fiona walked back into the park party, the entire room had gone silent. Everyone was staring at her with complete disgust. Pedro's mom was standing with her arms crossed. Pedro looked absolutely betrayed. You should leave, Pedro's mom said, her voice practically trembling with anger. Other guests quickly piled on. That's psychotic! Did you really just brag about ruining his relationships? This is why you'll always be just a friend. Fiona stood there with her mouth hanging open, trying to come up with an excuse. But it was too late. Pedro was done with her. Delete my number, lose my address. Don't ever show yourself in front of me ever again, he said, pointing to the door. Fiona begged and tried to blame me. She. She planned this, set me up. I smiled. She was right, of course. But no one believed her. Not anymore. You set yourself up. She gave you a chance to be a decent person, to be happy for me. But you couldn't even manage that for one night. The venue security escorted her out while she sobbed. But just as I thought I had gotten away, Pedro Later pulled me close and whispered. Full story on channel linked below.

I decided to surprise her with a full load of groceries and her favourite soup from the place downtown she'd loved since I was little. Her car wasn't in the driveway when I arrived at 11 on a Tuesday morning and the house was completely dark with newspapers still on the porch from three days ago. The neighbour trimming his hedges mentioned he'd seen her leave an hour ago in sparkly workout clothes, which made zero sense for someone supposedly bed bound. So I pulled out my phone to track hers through the family sharing app we'd set up years ago when she kept losing it. The location showed her at a fitness studio about 15 minutes away in the strip mall by the highway, which seemed weird. I parked nearby and glanced in the window and the glass storefront revealed everything. Before I even walked in, my dying mother was suspended upside down on a pole in the middle of the room, her legs in a perfect split while she held herself with just her arms. She wasn't taking a class or doing some gentle rehabilitation exercise. He was at the front of the room teaching 12 other women how to execute the move, calling out, squeeze those thighs, ladies. This is where we separate the Beginners from the pros while wearing a hot pink sports bra that said head instructor across the front. Our eyes met in the mirror while she was mid spin and transitioning into something she called a butterfly hold. And she lost her grip completely crashing onto the mat with a thud that made every student gasp. She scrambled up trying to explain it was physical therapy for chemo, but the giant schedule board behind her showed she taught six classes a week, including something called advanced Inversions and Pole competition prep. The other instructors rushed over asking if she was okay, calling her by name while she stood there in her tiny outfit trying to convince me that terminal cancer patients need to main tain flexibility. She finally broke down in the parking lot, ugly crying while she admitted she'd never been sick. She just couldn't stand Oliver and thought if she was dying, I'd finally choose her over him. She screamed that he wasn't good enough for her baby, that I'd thrown away my life for someone who'd never deserve me, and that she'd rather fake cancer than watch me stay married to him for one more day. I left her standing there in her pole outfit screaming at nobody, went home to Oliver who held me while I process the absolute insanity of what just happened. And we blocked her number while eating the soup I bought for her supposed final days.

My parents have always favored Jessica. But what happened after my grandmother died crossed every line. Grandma left me her downtown apartment, nothing fancy, worth about $180,000. Jessica makes six figures, drives a BMW, lives in a luxury condo with her surgeon boyfriend. I'm a graphic designer making decent money, but I've been renting for years. Two weeks after the funeral, my parents sat me down. We think Jessica should have the apartment. She's more successful. She'd make better use of it. They wanted me to sign it over for the good of the family. I said no, the apartment was left to me. If grandma wanted Jessica to have it, she would have left it to Jessica. My mom said, this is exactly why you'll never amount to anything, David. You're selfish and small minded. My dad added, look at your sister. She's successful. She's engaged to a doctor. What do you have to show for your life? They gave me one week to reconsider. Two weeks later, I went to the apartment to sort grandma's belongings. Jessica was inside with a measuring tape. Oh, David, perfect timing. I'm getting measurements for the renovation. We're thinking of knocking out this wall. My mom had given her a key. Jessica, I'm not signing over the apartment. She looked genuinely confused. Be reasonable. You can't afford to renovate properly. Michael and I have the vision and resources. Grandma was old. She didn't understand real estate potential. I changed the locks the next day. A week later, Jessica showed up with Michael. He had spreadsheets, renovation plans, neighborhood projections. We're offering you 50 thousand dollars for the apartment. That's free money, David. You could never afford the 80 thousand dollar renovation we're planning. I told them no. Jessica's tone shifted. David, let's be honest. You're 28, single, living in a studio. Your income is inconsistent. This apartment is probably the most valuable thing you'll ever own. Then she said it. Grandmother gave it to you out of pity. She felt sorry for you because you never got your life together like I did. Last week, my parents showed up at my workplace. They brought a lawyer, transfer documents, a notary stamp. Jessica gets the apartment. You get $100,000 cash. Everyone wins. My boss let us use his office. My dad spread the papers on his desk. David, you're 28 with nothing to show but this apartment you inherited. Jessica has earned the right to have nice things.

Look at this loser, he's fixing cars for free! Then cousins were laughing in the chat. I was two hours deep in that driveway. 95 degree heat, wet dripping down my back. His old Ford wouldn't start and he couldn't afford a real mechanic. So he called me like always. Not because he respected my time, because I wouldn't charge him. I had work that morning but dropped everything. Maybe this time would be different. I thought maybe he'd offer lunch, a thank you, something. Instead he handed me a lukewarm Gatorade, mumbled shouldn't take long, and went inside to watch TV. At one point I saw him on the porch, phone in his hand, filming me. I thought maybe it was one of those weird dad bad things. Like he was proud but didn't know how to say it. I even nodded at the camera like an idiot. I didn't realize what he'd done until I checked my phone during a water break. Bunch of notifications from the family group chat. A video of me hunched over the engine wiping sweat with the back of my hand. Caption look at this loser fixing cars for free like it's 1952. Then the comments started. My cousins jumped in first. LOL. Classic Kyle. Let me know when he's done, I got a toilet that needs scrubbing. Should have at least gone to trade school Bro, I wasn't even angry yet. Not until my coworker sent me a screenshot five minutes later. My dad had uploaded the same video to Facebook publicly. Check out this failure. Free work and still slowed the honors family discount. Over 60 comments. People I haven't heard from since high school. Laughing, tagging others. One guy said, didn't that dude cry once in gym class? Got 19 likes. I didn't say anything. Just put my tools back, close the hood, and drove away. No goodbye, no explanation. On the third day, my phone started blowing up. 30 missed calls, voicemails. One from my mom sobbing, another from my dad screaming. My uncle messaged, Kyle, what did you do? Fix this now! They had no idea what I had done. What? They didn't know. I've been flipping cars on the side for months. Registered my own LLC, had a shop lined up, papers filed. Two weeks before that Ford broke down. I'd finalized a deal.

Nah, I don't care how it sounds. I've been holding this in for years. You'd hate her too if your life looks like mine. I used to have a room, toys, parents who talk to me. Then she was born and suddenly I'm living in the damp, musty basement like a family pet because she needed to be closer to mom and dad. I was 6. They just shoved me downstairs and never looked back. She destroyed everything I owned, slobbered on my books, ripped the heads off my dolls, poured juice on my sketch pads. And if I cried, she doesn't know better be the bigger person, okay? So I'm just supposed to eat it while she wrecks my stuff. And then the MacBook, who gave it to me because I was top of my class. I was so proud of it. One day I came home and she'd absolutely demolished it, smashed screen, keys ripped off. It wouldn't even turn on. School blamed me. My parents blamed me like I purposely let a toddler Hulk smash a thousand dollar laptop. After that, I wasn't even a person. I was just on call babysitter, therapist, human punching bag. I couldn't hang out, couldn't study, couldn't sleep. If she screamed, I had to fix it. If she messed up, I had to clean it. My parents acted like I was a third parent. But without any respect or say anything. One time I turned off my phone for two hours to watch Spider Man with my friend Jake. I came out to 30+ missed calls like someone died. I called home and my mom was fuming. Where were you? We needed you. I ran home thinking there was some emergency. You know what happened? She wanted a snack and threw a tantrum. They grounded me for going to a movie. I was 17. And then the speech. I got picked to speak at this big school event. I was so proud. I told them weeks in advance. They said they'd come. I practiced every night like a loser hoping they'd finally care. They didn't show. I stood on stage and the crowd and nothing. No mom, no dad, just an empty row where they were supposed to be. I texted my mom after, sorry, she wasn't feeling well. Of course she wasn't. Of course, I didn't matter. Then the college talk. I was finally thinking about my future.

Five years of loyalty, countless late nights fixing his uncle's messes, and this is how it ends. Some punk treating me like trash. But here's where I got an idea. See, three months earlier, I'd set up something called a dead man switch in our system. It wasn't meant to be malicious, was actually a security feature I designed to protect the company if something happened to me. Basically, I had to confirm my employment status every week through a secure portal or else the system would automatically trigger a series of protocols. I'd mention this system in an email to Marcus's uncle before he retired, but clearly nobody bothered to read old emails. I calmly placed my badge and laptop on Marcus's desk. I want to check your emails carefully, I said quietly. Just get out, he sneered, already looking at his phone. I walked out of that building feeling weirdly calm. I went home, cracked open a beer and waited. Two hours later, my phone exploded with calls from Marcus. I ignored the first 7. On the 8th, I answered. What did you do? He screamed. Why can no one log in? And why did they just terminate the entire company's master license? I took a slow sip of my beer. I told you to check your emails, Marcus. When you fired me, you triggered the security protocol I designed. It's all documented. The system detected I was no longer employed and automatically locked down. Everything to prevent unauthorized access. Fix it, he yelled. Can't. I said simply, I don't work there anymore. Remember, you fired me? Badge, laptop and dignity on your desk. The silence on the other end was beautiful. Turns out data core systems went completely dark for four days. No one could access anything, not the servers, not the software licenses, not even the customer database. He lost three major clients and over $2 million. Marcus tried hiring the outsourced I t company to fix it, but they couldn't crack my encryption. Eventually, the board of directors called me, apologized profusely and offered me triple my old salary plus equity to come back and fix everything. I made them fire Marcus first. Now I'm the I t director with actual authority and I've never been happier.

Every time he moved me like an object, every time he cut me off, every time he acted like I was a thing instead of a person, I wrote it down in my notes app with dates and times. Two weeks later, we were at the grocery store. I was looking at pasta sauce and trying to decide between the regular marinara and the one with garlic. He walked up, took the jar out of my hand, put it back on the shelf, grabbed the regular one and put it in the cart. Didn't say a word. I put the jar back and grabbed the garlic one. He took it out of the cart and swapped it again. We did this three times before. I said I want the garlic one. The regular one is cheaper. He said it's a dollar difference, so get the cheaper one. I put the garlic one in the cart and walked away. He followed me and took it out again. I turned around and said, if you touch that jar one more time, I'm leaving you. He laughed, actually laughed over pasta sauce, over the fact that you treat me like I'm Not a person. He rolled his eyes and walked away. I left the cart in the middle of the aisle and went to my car. He came out 20 minutes later with two bags of groceries. The regular marinara was in one of them. When we got home, I packed a suitcase. Watched me from the bedroom doorway and said, you're really doing this over sauce? No, I'm doing this because you covered my mouth at dinner and because you move me around like furniture and because when I talk, you act like I'm background noise. You're being dramatic, he said. I zipped up the suitcase and walked past him. He grabbed my arm. Where are you going? My sister's. I left, stayed at my sister's place for three days. He texted me twice, once to ask where the garage door opener was and once to ask if I'd paid the water Bill. Nothing about us, just logistical questions like I was his assistant. I left the house keys on the counter and walked out, filed for divorce the next week. He signed the papers without a lawyer and that was it.

Yesterday, the CEO held up a letter in the board meeting and turned pale, who caused a 100,000 euro a day fine by failing to renew our main European operating license. So this happened last month and I'm still kind of shocked by how it all went down. I'm 29 and work as a compliance manager for a midsize tech company. Basically, my job is to make sure we follow all the rules so we can legally operate in different countries. Every year, I fly to Brussels to personally submit our renewal documents for our EU operating license. European bureaucracy requires original signatures submitted in person at their main office. No exceptions. I've been doing this for three years, always approved without issues. Then Derek got promoted to be my new manager. He's 35, ambitious and desperate to impress upper management by cutting unnecessary costs. Two weeks before my scheduled Brussels trip, Derek calls a team meeting with this smug grin. No more expensive foreign vacations on company time. If you can handle something with an email or video call, that's what you'll do. I raise my hand. Derek, my Brussels trip isn't a vacation. I need to submit our EU license renewal in person. It's legally required. He literally rolls his eyes. That's exactly the outdated thinking I'm talking about. Send it via courier. I try to explain the EU office doesn't accept career submissions for this license. Derek leans back, looking so pleased with himself. Then send someone from our London office. We don't have anyone there with proper authorization and I need three weeks to transfer it. He cuts me off. I don't want excuses. No more expensive foreign vacations on my watch. Figure it out. I just say okay and walk out. I immediately cancel my flight and hotel. I document everything. Derek's exact words, the meeting minutes.

I've been there for five years basically holding the entire digital infrastructure together with digital duct tape and prayer. I managed all the licenses, passwords, access codes.

Everything was fine until 6 months ago when our CEO retired and his nephew Marcus, this 32 year old trust fund kid with an MBA from his dad's donations took over. Marcus had zero tech experience but endless confidence. His first move immediately started cutting costs and acting like a corporate tough guy from some bad movie. I tried working with him. I really did. But Marcus treated everyone like disposable resources. He'd storm into meetings, interrupt people and talk about optimizing human capital. The guy wore expensive suits and acted like he invented business itself. Last Tuesday, Marcus called me into his office. I figured it was another lecture about server costs or something. Instead he had this smug little smile on his face that made my stomach drop. We're making some organizational changes, he said, leaning back in. His leather chair. Your position is being eliminated. We're outsourcing I t to save money. I was stunned. Outsourcing Marcus. I'm the only one who knows how everything connects. The licensing alone. He cut me off with a wave. We'll figure it out.

While I waited, I picked up his wallet from his pants, Driver's license, told me his name was Marcus Bryant, credit cards, family photos, wife And two kids smiling at the camera.

I'm leaving you and moving to Palm Springs with my 25 year old babe. I'm taking our money with me. I calmly replied, sure, good luck. When she realized what I had done, it was already too late. The message came through at 2:00am while I was halfway through a brutal night shift in the North Sea. I'm leaving you for Tyler. He's 25 and we're moving to Palm Springs together. Already cleaned out the bank account. Have a nice life. I'm Jake. I'm 48 and I've worked offshore oil rigs for 23 years. When I saw that text from my wife, Nicole, I just stared at my phone. Then came the screenshot. Our joint savings showing zero dollars where $156,000 used to be. She even added a smiley face. I didn't freak out, didn't call her screaming. I just typed back, sure, good luck, and went back to work. The next morning I got an email. Nicole had already filed for divorce claiming I abandoned her by working overseas. Her lawyer was demanding spousal support. She said Tyler was already living in our house in Texas. I didn't panic. I just sent one text to my brother Marcus, who's an accountant. Activate Operation Freeze. Three minutes later he replied, done. Don't respond to anything. Here's what Nicole didn't know. Five years ago after she started acting weird and distant, I got suspicious. She stopped asking when I'd be home, stopped sending me photos. Our calls got shorter and colder. So I created a separate company called North Star Investments. Every paycheck I deposit just enough in our joint account to cover bills. The rest went into North Star, completely legal, properly taxed, but in a name she'd never think to look for. Over five years, I'd quietly moved $890,000 into accounts she didn't know existed. The 150, $6,000 she stole, that was basically my bait money. Two weeks later, I flew home early. My neighbor texted me that a moving truck showed up. I landed in Texas and drove straight to my brother's house. Marcus had been busy.

The first major red flag came when I reviewed our quarterly report. Wrong dates, missing signatures. The compliant section, the part that says we followed all the laws, wasn't just incomplete, it Was completely blank. I compared it to last quarter's report. Numbers had been changed, rounded up, expense lines trimmed, dates shifted forward. This wasn't a mistake. These were choices. I sent Derek my first formal warning email. Professional. No. No emotion. Just facts. Listed every problem, cited the regulations, requested corrections. His response? Two hours later. Got it. That was it. No corrections followed. No questions.

She suddenly became a food critic. My girlfriend insisted I cook for her roommate's birthday dinner at our apartment. I've been planning the menu all week, but she kept reminding me not to go overboard with the fancy stuff because Lexi preferred simple food. The second I started prepping in the kitchen, setting up my mise on place and heating the cast iron, my girlfriend grabbed her phone and sprawled on the couch. I'm ordering sushi for myself, he announced without looking up. Your food's always too heavy. I watched her scroll through TikTok while I worked on the carbonara from scratch, making fresh pasta and whisking eggs with pecorino Romano. Smells incredible in here, said a voice from the doorway. Lexi had come home early from work, dark hair pulled back, still in her office clothes, the type who actually appreciated effort when she saw it. Oh, my god. Odd, she said, moving closer to the stove. Are you making pasta from scratch? She actually watched me work, not the polite glance people usually give. I didn't know guys our age even knew how to cook like this. My ex could barely make cereal. We started talking about food. While I finished the dish. She traveled through Italy last summer, Rome, Florence, Bologna, real interest, asking about techniques and ingredients. Have you always cooked like this? Lexi asked, leaning against the counter. I'd love to. Learn sometime. Your girlfriend is so lucky. My chest tightened. My girlfriend had never once asked to learn anything I made, not once in two years of dating. I'd even catered her office party last month and she'd introduced the food. Food is something we picked up. Does she eat my food? I asked. Lexi's expression shifted slightly. Well, she mentioned you cook a lot. She paused. Actually, now that I think about it, I've never seen her eat anything you've made. She's always getting take out when we hang out. That hit harder than expected. I cooked five nights a week and ate most meals alone. Lexi must have seen something in my face because she stepped closer. That's her loss. This looks restaurant quality. It's nothing special, I said. Plating the carbonara from the living room, I caught my girlfriend glancing over while pretending to watch Netflix. Her eyes narrowed slightly seeing Lexi and me talking. Lexi noticed too and smiled. Well, well.

Like, I'd be making dinner, and he'd walk up behind me, grab my waist, and physically move me aside so he could look in the pot. Not ask me to move, just pick me up and shift me over like I was a chair in his way. Or I'd be watching TV on the couch, and he'd literally lift my legs, sit down, and drop my legs back on his lap without saying a word. At first, I thought maybe he was trying to be playful, but there was nothing affectionate about it. His face was always blank. He'd just do it and go back to whatever he was doing. The worst part was when I was trying to talk to him about something important, I'd be mid sentence, and he'd pick up his phone and start scrolling. If I kept talking, he'd hold up one finger like, hold on, with not even looking at me. One time, we were arguing about his mom coming to stay with us for two weeks without asking me first. I was telling him why that was a problem, and he Literally walked away, just turned around mid conversation and went to the bathroom. Came back 10 minutes later and was like, so what do you want for dinner? Like, we hadn't been talking about anything. Then came the thing that made me snap. We were at his parents house for Sunday dinner. His mom made pot roast and those weird candied carrots she always makes. Everyone was sitting around the table and his mom asked me about my job. I work at a vet clinic as a technician. And I was telling the story about how we had to sedate this huge Great Dane who was terrified of nail clippers. Right in the middle of my story, my husband reaches over and just covers my mouth with his hand. Like, fully puts his palm over my lips. Then he says to his dad, did you see the game last night? Everyone at the table went quiet. His mom's fork stopped halfway to her mouth. His dad just stared. My husband acted like he didn't do anything weird. He kept his hand on my mouth for a solid three seconds before I smacked it away. I stood up and walked out, got in my car and drove home. He showed up an hour later with this confused look on his face, like he genuinely didn't understand what he did wrong. What's your problem? He asked. You covered my mouth at dinner. I said, yeah, because dad asked me about the game.

Wanted to surprise Lisa with gets to Cancun for our anniversary next month. I even stopped and bought her favorite flowers. On the way home, I pulled into our driveway around midnight. The house was dark except for our bedroom light upstairs. I smiled, thinking she'd fallen asleep reading again. Then I opened the front door. Men's dress shirt on the floor, Lisa's blouse a few feet away. A trail of clothes leading up the stairs like some twisted bread crumb path. His pants, her skirt, all the way up to our bedroom. I stood there for maybe 30 seconds just staring. My brain couldn't process what I was seeing. Then I heard it, laughter from upstairs. Her laugh and a man's voice I didn't recognize. I moved my recliner from the den and positioned it at the bottom of the stairs just out of sight. Then I sat down and I waited. While I waited, I picked up his wallet from his pants, driver's license, told me his name was Marcus Bryant, credit cards, family photos. Wife and two kids smiling at the camera. I found his phone on the coffee table and called his house. A woman answered Furious. Marcus, where the hell are you? You missed Ethan's 6th birthday party. Missus Brian, I'm not Marcus, I said calmly. My name is David Chen.

I just graduated med school, top of my class. My parents insisted on celebrating at this fancy steakhouse downtown. When we got there, my dad pointed to this tiny corner table. You sit there, kiddo. The adults need to discuss your future. I'm 26, just became a doctor, but apparently I'm still kiddo. They sat at the main table, my parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, ordering champagne, lobster, everything expensive on the menu. I sat alone watching them toast to our family success while I wasn't even included. That's when I got an idea. I called the waiter over and quietly said, see that big table? I'm paying for everything. Just bring me the check when they're done. He nodded and walked away. For the next hour, I watched them feast, 300 dollar wine bottles, multiple appetizers, desserts. They were having the time of their lives. My aunt ordered three different entrees just to try them. My uncle got the most expensive scotch on the menu. My mom kept calling the waiter over like he was her personal servant. And through it all, I sat in my corner sipping water, watching them celebrate my achievement without me. My cousin Hannah kept taking photos for Instagram. Family dinner vibes he posted, making sure I wasn't in any of the shots. Uncle Joseph started telling embarrassing stories about my Childhood. Remember when little Zachary wanted to be a superhero? They all laughed while I sat there feeling like I was 12 again. Finally, they started getting up to leave. That's when I stood up and announced, thanks for celebrating with me, everyone. Dinner's on me tonight. They all cheered and hugged me. My dad even said, now that's what I call family. My mom teared up. You're so generous, sweetheart. We're so proud. I paid the 24 dollar Bill with a smile, left a enerous tip 2. The waiter looked impressed. But here's the thing. I'd already called ahead and reserved that corner table under my dad's name and requested the waiter put everything on the reservation holder's card. I just.

At six forty two PM, gravel crunched in the driveway. She probably thought it was a delivery. Instead, when she opened the door, Amanda stood there with their two kids and Derek's parents behind them. Is this the Winston property? Amanda asked calmly. My wife stammered. This is my house. Amanda smiled sadly. Not for much longer, I suppose. That's when Derek walked in from the deck and froze. His face went completely white. Hi, honey, Amanda said. I assume we'll be staying in the guest cottage. Then my car pulled up. I walked in carrying a duffle bag, waved at the kids, looked around like I was inspecting a hotel. Evening, everyone, hope you don't mind. I figured since everyone was heading this way, I'd coordinate. My wife couldn't speak. I'd invited them all. That night. I made everyone dinner, grilled salmon, her recipe. We all sat together at the table, my wife, Derek, his wife, his kids, his parents and me. Derek's mom broke the silence. So how long have you two been involved? Nobody left the table. Nobody could because leaving would be admitting everything. For three days, we all stayed in that house together. I served meals. Derek's wife asked pointed questions. His parents watched in disappointed silence. My wife and Derek slept in separate rooms, exiled in their own betrayal. On the final morning, I handed my wife her packed suitcase on the porch. I'm staying here. I Said, you made your choice at our beach house, so now it's yours. The deed, the bills, everything, it's all in your name now. She looked confused. You're giving me the house? No, I said calmly. I'm giving you exactly what you wanted. You just have to live with what you did to get, get it. As I walked back inside, I saw the realtor's car pulling up to plant a for sale sign in the sand. She got the house, but she'd be selling it alone with nothing but the memory of the weekend everyone watched her world collapse.

Oh, yeah. She said it at Thanksgiving in front of the whole family. But don't worry. She still wanted to come tonight. She loves being seen with successful people, even if one of them is me. The whole table went quiet. A sponsor's wife laughed nervously. Diane's husband, a City Council member, raised his eyebrows and said, that's. Wow. Carol was three tables away, but she'd heard me. I watched her face go from confused to horrified to bright red. She stood up, grabbed her purse, and walked out. Jake found me 20 minutes later in the hallway. What did you say to her? The truth. She's outside crying. She wants to leave. Then she can leave. Why would you do that? I looked at him. She called me ugly Jake. And in front of your whole family. And you said nothing? Not one word. So, yeah, I told the truth. And if she's embarrassed, good. She should be. He just stared at me. The next day, photos from the gala started circulating online. Not because of me, because someone had recorded Carol in the parking lot, screaming at a valet for taking too long with her car. She was waving her arms, yelling about disrespect, looking completely unhinged. Someone posted it with the caption, charity event guest loses it over 90 second wait. It got shared hundreds of times. A local blogger wrote about it. Carol's name got attached to it. She called Jake in tears, begging him to make it go away. He couldn't. She stopped going to public events, stopped posting on social media. Just disappeared. Two weeks later, my boss called me into her office. I thought I was in trouble. Instead, she said, we're expanding the events team. I want you to lead it. You handled that gala like a pro. Even with all the chaos. I got a promotion, a raise, a new title. Jake apologized eventually. Said he should have stood up for me, that he didn't realize how bad it had gotten. I looked at him and said, you knew. You just didn't care enough to do anything. He tried to argue, but I cut him off. I'm not ugly, Jake. I'm just done pretending your mom's cruelty is something I have to tolerate. And I'm done with you letting her. We're still married. For now. But things aren't the same.

I'd been with Jake for four years at that point, married for two. And his mom, Carol, had been making comments the whole time, little digs that Jake always brushed off. That dress washes you out. Have you thought about doing something different with your hair? Jake's ex girlfriend was so photogenic, I kept my mouth shut because Jake would always say the same thing. She's just old fashioned. She doesn't mean it like that. But that Thanksgiving, I wore a dark green sweater I actually felt good in. I'd done my makeup carefully. I walked into their dining room holding a pumpkin pie I'd spent three hours on. And Carol looked me up and down. Then she turned to Jake's Aunt Linda and said loud enough for the whole table to hear, well, at least she can bake. With a face like that, she'll need other skills. The room went dead silent. Jake's dad coughed. Sister Becca stared at her plate. And Jake, he just looked at me with this helpless expression and said nothing. I sat the pie down, smiled and said, I'll go grab the whipped cream. I didn't cry in the kitchen. I didn't leave. I just stood there gripping the counter, deciding something. I, I was done being quiet. Two months later, my company held its annual winter Gala. I've been planning it for a year. It was a huge deal. Local politicians, business owners, donors, big names, open bar, fancy venue downtown. I was running the whole thing. And I looked good. Black dress, hair done, makeup flawless. I felt powerful. Carol had been asking Jake for weeks if she could come. She loved events like this, loved name dropping, loved being in photos with important people. Jake asked me if it was okay and I said, sure, she can come. He looked relieved. The night of the gala, everything went perfectly. The mayor showed up. So did a state senator. Carol was in her element, floating around with a glass of wine, introducing herself to anyone who looked important. Then during the dinner portion, I was seated at the head table with the event sponsors. The mayor's chief of staff, a woman named Diane, complimented my speech. You did an amazing job tonight. Seriously, this whole event is beautiful. I smiled. Thank you. That means a lot. My mother in law told me I was too ugly to be taken seriously in public. So it's nice to hear I pulled it off anyway. Diane's smile froze. I'm sorry, what?

Like Derek was just some coworker and not the guy I'd watched her flirt with at every company barbecue for the past six. Six months. I didn't even look up from my laptop. If you go to our beach house with him, I said quietly, we're done. She laughed. Actually laughed. You don't mean that. It's just a work trip. I meant every word. When she grabbed her keys and walked out that Friday morning, she thought she called my bluff. What she didn't know was that I'd already seen the calendar invite on her unlocked iPad. Coastal getaway, Derek plus me, same weekend. She told me to take some time for myself, so I did. I packed a bag and made some calls. First, I called Derek's wife, Amanda. She listened without saying a word for almost 10 minutes, then quietly said, I'll be there. Next, I called Derek's parents. His mom said, we always had a feeling we'll come. Then I called the property manager, the same woman who helped us buy that house fifteen years ago. I doubled her weekend rate and asked her to prepare the house for unexpected family guests. I also did something else. I replaced the framed wedding photo in The hallway with something special. A zoomed in print of our prenup signature page. Specifically the section about property reassignment in cases of infidelity. My wife never read the fine print. No, but he ever does. That Friday evening at 6:08 p m, she posted a photo to her Instagram story. Her toes in the sand, expensive wine in hand, sunset in the background. And in the windows reflection, Derek shirtless, holding another glass.

When I asked why, they said, you'll see at 2:15, everyone shouted in unison. I looked around confused and set my bag on the desk. 28 12 year old staring at me through dark lenses like a miniature Secret Service. The lesson plan Missus Stevens had left said nothing about this. I tried to shake it off and started taking attendance, but all the kids were staring into space as if they couldn't see me. The girls were bouncing their heads like bobbleheads, while the guys were reaching for the air like they had beef with oxygen. Okay, seriously, what's going on with the eyewear? I asked again, trying to sound like the cool substitute. Nobody answered. They just continued their conversations like I hadn't said anything. What stuck out most was the one kid without glasses. This kid, Claxton, in the middle row, just sat there looking down at his desk. Why was he the only one without them? During my prep period, I found another teacher in the lounge. Hey, quick question. Why are all the kids in room 2:03 wearing sunglasses? Well, all except one. Missus in Creamer suddenly became very interested in stirring her coffee. Oh, that's just a thing they do. But why, though? And why doesn't Claxton have any? She grabbed her mug and headed for the door. Go to the principal about it. I Have copies to make, so I did. Mister Williams, the kids in my class are all wearing sunglasses, except for Claxton, and no one will tell me why he checked his watch. Hmm. Well, as long as they're not disrupting learning, I don't see a problem. But if it bothers you, ask the janitors. He cleans that room more than any other.

You ever meet a kid that's just way too smart for their own good? Yeah. That's my daughter Mia. 8 years old. Tiny, curly haired, big brown eyes, the sweetest little smile, and behind it, a brain that works like a full time con artist. Me and her dad, Mark, had been separated for about a year. Nothing dramatic. No screaming matches, no lawyers banging on tables. Just stopped working. We only talked to swap Mia back and forth, and even that was dry. Drop off at 5? Yeah. Okay, that was it. Apparently, Mia decided that was unacceptable. One Friday at my place, she's sitting at the table coloring. She looks up and goes, mom, you ever think about dad? I'm like, sure, honey. Why? She just shrugs. I think you should talk more. I tell her, we're fine, baby. We just live different lives now. She doesn't say another word. Just goes back to her crayons. The next weekend, she's at her dad's when he opens her backpack to get her homework folder. There's a folded pink note inside. From mom, she says. He opens it. Neat handwriting, signed with a little heart. It says, I miss the way we used to laugh. Maybe we should talk. Mark reads it twice. Feels weird, but a little warm inside. Next Friday at drop off. Instead of the usual quick here you go by. He lingers for a Second says, hey, how's work? I'm caught off guard, but I answer. We smile just a little, Mia standing between us, holding both our hands, looking like she just won an award. The week after that, she's back with me. I open her lunch box to clean it and see a folded blue note. She says, it's from dad. I open it, says, I've been thinking about us. Maybe we can try again. My heart jumps. I couldn't say anything like that in a year. I just smiled. Next drop off, I don't just hand her over. I ask him, how's your mom doing? He smiles. We chat for a minute. We both laugh at something stupid. Mia says she's beaming like it's Christmas morning. Week after week, it keeps happening. Little notes, sweet words. No questions asked. Neither of us thinks to confirm anything. We just believe. And every Friday, during the hand off, we talk longer. We start making eye contact again, smiling without realizing it. One time, he reaches out and tucks my hair behind my ear. Without thinking, I feel my stomach lip. One Friday, it's pouring rain. He offers to walk me to my car under his umbrella.

I yelled at him that I could have died, called him irresponsible, stupid and childish. I told him he's lucky I'm not pressing charges. He begged me to forgive him, but still said that he was sorry for what happened but not for what he did. I said I needed space and went upstairs. I locked myself in the bedroom and cried for what felt like hours. I knew I was going to divorce him, but I also realised that I wanted to get back at him. I decided that for the next 24 hours, I would act like everything was fine and serve him an amazing meal. That was my revenge. I came out and said that I forgave him and that I thought about and that I let my peanut allergy control my life, that I ate trace amounts of peanuts and survived. I sweet talked him into thinking it was all okay. And the next night I made him dinner. I prepared marinated chicken and homemade wholemeal bread as well as pasta. I told him this dinner was to celebrate our new start and me opening myself up to the power of the mind. He was so excited hearing this and we finished our Meal half an hour later. But then another 15 minutes went by and he started complaining that his stomach was sore. That's when I said, oh, yeah. I marinated the chicken and buttermilk and the pasta was soaked in butter before I cooked it. I also put cheese sauce into the preparation. I know you're lactose intolerant, but this is exposure therapy. I did say I was willing to start it. He looked at me with a look of betrayal. Not even a minute later, he ran upstairs. He stayed in the toilet for over an hour. And as he was in there, I packed clothes for a few nights. I then drove to my sister's where I am currently staying.

My husband is one of those people who believes that the power of the mind can combat anything. So much so that when my grandmother had cancer, he told her that instead of going to chemo, she should meditate and convince herself she isn't sick. I wouldn't mind it if he didn't push this ideology onto me, but he does, and our biggest problem has always been my peanut allergy. I am deathly allergic to peanuts and have been all my life, but he refuses to believe how severe it is and many times has tried forcing me to do exposure therapy. I even took him to the doctors with me, where he was told my allergy is so bad that exposure therapy could kill me. And still he claimed he was right and that the doctor was a brainwashed idiot. Well, yesterday he took it upon himself to prove that exposure therapy can work. I came home from work and he surprised me with a batch of homemade cookies. I was confused at first and asked him why he made them since he is lactose intolerant, but he said it was a surprise for me. I excitedly kissed him, but before taking a bite, I asked for the ingredients. He told me they were just normal cookies, then got me to smell one. I did and thought they smelled strange. But I didn't say anything. My husband then broke off an absolutely tiny piece and started inspecting it. He joked that he was just doing a quality check, then gave it to me. I ate the tiny piece and immediately started to feel hot. I broke into a sweat and my throat started to swell. I told my husband something was wrong, and when he saw me double over and grab my neck and chest, he called the ambulance. I went blue in the face and my body felt like it was on fire, but I mustered up the strength to yell at him to get the Epipen. He did as I asked and used it on me, and I instantly felt myself start to regain the ability to breathe. I heaved air into my lungs, and thankfully the ambulance came quickly. I was discharged after a few hours and was more or less okay. Afterwards, I asked my husband to explain how that happened.

My daughter stopped coming home because she said I made her compete for my attention with a dead woman. It started when she made varsity swim team as a sophomore. Only three underclassmen made it that year. She came home waving the acceptance letter. Dad, I made varsity. I was standing in the hallway. The one covered floor to ceiling with photos of my late wife. Wedding pictures, her high school swim trophies, beach vacations. I'd spent two weekends building it. After the funeral, I looked at a photo of my wife teaching our daughter to swim when she was 3. Your mom would have been so proud. She taught you in that exact pool. Will remember? My daughter's smile faded. Yeah, dad, I remember. She went to her room. I heard the door close. That became every single conversation. When she made honor roll, I showed her my wife's valedictorian plaque. When she won regionals, I pulled out a box of my wife's medals and spread them on the kitchen table. Look at these. This is what real dedication looks like. She just stared at them. When she asked me to come to parent teacher night, I said I couldn't. It was the anniversary of my wife's death. I needed to go to the cemetery. But, dad, it's only once a year. And it's my junior year. It matters. Your mom matters, too. I went to the grave Instead, sat there three hours talking to a headstone. My daughter ate microwave Mac and cheese alone. I thought I was keeping my wife's memory alive. I thought I was being a good husband. I didn't notice. My daughter stopped showing me her report cards, stop telling me about swim practice. Started eating every meal in her room. Then came her 18th birthday. I took her to this Italian place downtown. Her favorite. She'd been asking to go for two months. We sat down. She ordered chicken parmesan. I started talking before the waiter even left. Mom and I came here for our first anniversary. She ordered the same thing, same table. Actually, my daughter put her menu down. Dad, do you even know what place I got at regionals? I opened my mouth. Nothing came out. Third place. She said her voice was quiet. Out of 47 swimmers. I texted you the results. I called you four times. I left a note on the counter right next to your coffee mug. You were at the cemetery talking to someone who can't answer you instead of watching me swim. I tried to say something, but she kept going. I made states, dad. States. I'm competing at the state championship in two weeks. I'm one of only six sophomores in the entire region who qualified. And you have no idea because

The art teacher's email arrived on a Wednesday afternoon with a subject line that made my stomach drop, concerns about Iris. Please call ASAP. Daughter was 7 years old and had been painting with me every single evening since she was 4, creating sunset after sunset with a skill that amazed everyone who saw her work. I called Missus Kellerman immediately from my office, already defensive before she even answered. Mister Cross, thank you for calling back so quickly, she said, her voice carefully neutral. I wanted to discuss something I noticed during today's art class. Iris completed a color wheel assignment and I'm concerned she might be having some vision issues. She paused and I heard papers rustling. She labeled every single color incorrectly, not just mixing up similar shades, but completely wrong identifications. She called red gray, orange, brown, yellow, light gray, green, medium gray. Every color on the wheel was mislabeled as some shade of gray. My first reaction was to defend Iris, to say the teacher must have misunderstood, but some something about the systematic nature of the errors stop me. I asked Missus Kellerman to email me photos of the assignment. And when they arrived five minutes later, I stared at my computer screen feeling like the floor was dissolving beneath my chair. The color wheel was technically perfect, each section painted with smooth gradients and precise Boundaries, but every label was wrong and exactly the way the teacher had described. I immediately thought about our painting sessions, the three years of evening rituals where we painted hundreds of sunsets together. And suddenly I was seeing them differently. How many times had I said mix orange and pink for those clouds? And watched Iris confidently select paints while I praised her color choices? I left work early and drove home in a daze, calling Iris's pediatrician from the car. Doctor Patel squeezed us in for an appointment the next morning and referred us to a pediatric ophthalmologist named Doctor Vivian Leeds, who specialized in color vision deficiencies. I watched Iris during our painting session with new attention, really looking at what she was doing. We were painting the sunset visible through our dining room window, and I described it out loud the way I always did. Look at those beautiful orange and pink clouds, I said, pointing at the sky. Try mixing some cadmium orange with a touch of titanium white and maybe a hint of quinacridone magenta. Iris nodded seriously and reached for paints, confidently squeezing colors onto her palette. But when I looked closely at what she'd selected, my chest tightened. The orange she'd chosen was actually a brown. The pink was a gray. She was mixing them together with complete confidence, creating a muddy, brownish gray mixture.

I woke up in a hospital bed after eight weeks, and the first words out of my brother's mouth were, we had to put Cooper down. I'm sorry. He wouldn't eat that. Said it was kinder this way. Cooper was my six year old golden retriever. I'd raised him from a puppy. He slept at the foot of my bed every single night. When I tried to speak, nothing came out except his choking sound. My brother patted my shoulder and said, it's okay. We got the kids a new puppy, a Labrador. They named him Buddy. They were talking about replacing my dog like he was a broken appliance. My name is Tim, short for Timothy. And before the accident, I was a software engineer living alone with Cooper. Denver. The accident happened when a delivery truck ran a red light and T boned my car at 50 miles per hour. The impact threw me into a concrete barrier, and I sustained severe head trauma that required emergency surgery. I've been in a medically induced coma for three weeks and then in a minimally conscious state for another five weeks. During that entire time, I could hear everything happening around me, but my body wouldn't respond. I couldn't move or speak or signal that I was conscious and understanding every word. What my family didn't know was that my brain was recording every conversation with perfect Clarity. I have this thing where I remember details really well. Always have. After the head injury, that ability got even stronger. Every word spoken near my hospital bed got stored in my mind with exact precision. My mom visited during the first month talking about medical bills piling up. Mentioned Cooper a few times saying my brother was taking care of him. Then around week 4, her tone changed. She stopped mentioning Cooper. Instead, she talked about how my brother's kids wanted a puppy and how expensive coop first food and vet bills were. She said we might need to make some practical decisions about the dog. My brother visited less, but when he did, he talked to my mom in the hallway. I could hear every word he said. Cooper was getting depressed, wouldn't eat much, just sat by the front door waiting. My mom said, we can't keep spending money on a dog when your kids want one and Tim might not even wake up. maybe it would be kinder to put him down before he suffers more. I was screaming inside.

I pretended to get arrested to see who would bail me out. Three months ago, I got the idea after watching my cousin get locked up for a bar fight and his parents had him out in under an hour. Meanwhile, I've been the family a t m for years, covering my sister's car payment four months straight, putting down 12,000 for my brother's condo and lending my uncle eight grand for his landscaping business. So when I needed help moving last September from a third floor walk up, nobody could make it. My sister had brunch, my brother had work, my uncle's back hurt. So I started planning my revenge. I called my buddy who works at the precinct and he agreed to stage a fake arrest at our family barbecue last Sunday. He showed up in uniform with a patrol car, read me my rights in front of everyone and cuffed me next to the grill where my dad was cooking burgers. Charged with destruction of property at a local business and bail was set at $5,000, which I'd casually mentioned the week before at dinner that I had sitting in my savings account from my work bonus. My sister was the first person to react. She pulled out her phone immediately and started recording vertical video for social media. This is going straight to TikTok, she said, actually laughing out loud like it was the Funniest thing she'd ever witnessed. My brother walked inside the house to grab another beer from the fridge. Absolutely nothing was happening. Didn't even bother to ask what I supposedly destroyed or if I was okay. My uncle, the exact one whose entire landscaping business I funded with my own money, said, well, you shouldn't have broken the law, buddy, and casually flipped his burger on the grill. My mom was more worried about what the neighbours would think. She told me I'd embarrass the whole family in front of everyone on the street. My dad said, this is exactly what happens when you don't think before acting. He refused to even look at me, just kept grilling like I wasn't being arrested 10 feet away from him. Then about five minutes later, my girlfriend pulled up in her car. She wasn't even invited to the Barbie. Someone from my family had texted her about what was happening. And she drove straight over, still wearing her work scrubs from her hospital shift. She came running up to the patrol car with this panicked look on her face asking if I was okay, what happened? Are you hurt? How much is the bail? And when my buddy who was playing the officer said $5,000, she didn't even hesitate.

We have just as much right to be here as you do. Haley crossed her arms and smirks. Besides, where would we even go? You'd really kick out your own brother onto the streets? That's pretty cold. Mom started crying those manipulative tears. How can you be so selfish and cruel? We're family. Family is supposed to help each other in hard times. Your grandmother would be so disappointed in you. That's when I calmly walked to my office and came back with a folder I've been keeping safe. I pulled out the deed and all the property documents. Asked my name on every single page. Not Dan's, not Mom's, mine. Grandma knew exactly who she could trust with her house. You have exactly 30 days to leave, I said as calmly as I could manage. Dan's face went completely pale. Haley started yelling about tenant rights and illegal eviction. Mom called me heartless and said I was abandoning family over petty pride and bitterness. For the next month, they made my life absolutely hell. Broke dishes and furniture, intentionally let Rex escape outside twice, and I had to search the entire neighborhood frantically for hours. Told all our relatives I was kicking them out for absolutely no reason, and painted me as the villain. The Day after they finally left, still calling me names, a real estate developer called me. She'd been watching the neighborhood closely and wanted to make an offer. The area was getting gentrified really fast. I sold it for $200,000 over the original asking price. Cash offer. Bought a gorgeous condo across town with floor to ceiling windows, a 24 hour doorman, and a huge dog park where Rex immediately made friends. Got a dedicated home office with a door that actually locks and soundproof walls. My productivity doubled within weeks. Landed three new major clients. Last week, Dan texted out of nowhere, hey, sis, having a rough month. Can you spot me rent? Just one $200. I'll pay you back soon, I promise. I sent him a photo of me and Rex on our new balcony overlooking the city skyline at sunset. Added a caption, sorry, spent all my money on this amazing view. Then I blocked his number permanently. Mom called from Dan's phone ten minutes later. You've changed. Money and success have made you cruel and heartless. I said, no boundaries and self respect made me happy and hung up. Best decision of my entire life.

At Sunday dinner, when dad asked about my allowance, I watched our family explode. What do you mean? Dad's voice was confused. I've been sending $2,000 every month since you started school. Mom kept cutting her pot roast, not looking up. Where is Henry's money? Dad asked mom. Silence stretched forever. I haven't sent any money to Henry. What? Why not? I've been keeping it for Mariah. She needs it more. She's studying fashion in Paris. She needs to look the part. Dad's face turned white. You've been withholding Henry's allowance, letting him work himself into a hospital while secretly sending thousands to Mariah for shopping. Mariah has potential. She's special. She's delicate. Henry is exactly like you. He'll be fine. He doesn't need help. And Henry doesn't have potential. He's studying medicine. That's exactly it. He's practical. Mariah needs more support. The truth kept getting worse. Three thousand dollars monthly for living expenses. Another 2,000 to 3,000 some months for networking events, proper clothes, accessories. While I collapsed from malnutrition, my sister was burning through 5,000 to 6,000 dollars monthly of family money. Then dad discovered the nuclear bomb. Mom had been diverting money from our family trust, money meant to be split equally when we turned 25. She'd secretly moved. Three hundred thousand Dollars into a separate account under Mariah's name. $300,000. Dad repeated slowly, you stole $300,000 from our son. Dad froze every account that night and filed for divorce the next week. When Dad's lawyer presented evidence of the financial misconduct, the hidden accounts, the systematic diversion of funds, the judge was completely unsympathetic to Mom's claims. Two years later, I'm thriving in medical school with proper nutrition and sleep. My grades shot up immediately once I could focus on studying instead of survival. Dad is happier than I've ever seen him. He visits me in New York every few months and we've grown closer than ever before. Mariah Learned to budget, got a part time job and built a successful fashion line working within constraints.

I had to apologize profusely. I was completely mortified. My mom overhears from the kitchen where she's making dan breakfast and comes barging into his defense.

And I'd get complaints from clients during important calls. He redecorated my entire living room without asking permission, said my style was depressing and outdated. Dan ate all my groceries every week and never once replaced anything. Mom gave them my master bedroom because they're a couple and need more space than you. I was literally sleeping on my own couch in my own house. The final straw came when I checked my credit card statement. Dan had somehow gotten my card information and charged $3,000 for a new TV and sound system. I completely snapped. You all need.

I felt my hands shaking. So what do I do? You want me to scare them or do you want to actually press charges? I thought about it, about every time they'd overstepped, every time they made decisions for me like I was still 12. Every time dad dismissed something I cared about because he knew better scare them. For now, Marcus said he'd draft something official, make it look serious, give them 72 hours to return the vehicle or face criminal prosecution. Send it tomorrow morning, 9:00am sharp. They'll have it in their inbox before their first coffee that night. I barely slept. Part of me felt guilty. The other part was furious. The next morning, I woke up at 8:45, made coffee, waited. At 9:00 am, my phone buzzed, text from Marcus and check your email, C, C, d, U. I opened it. The subject line read, notice of Criminal Vehicle Theft, 72 hours to return vehicle or face prosecution. The letter was brutal, cited specific statutes, mentioned potential jail time, listed the exact vehicle number, make, model and title information. It explained that selling a vehicle without the owner's consent constituted felony theft regardless of familial relationship. Then it gave them three options, return the vehicle immediately, pay market value plus legal fees, or face criminal charges with the local prosecutor's office. At the bottom, Marcus included his bar number and firm letterhead. It looked official as hell. I sat there Staring at my phone, wait, 9:00am Mom called. I didn't answer. 9:00am, Dad called, didn't answer. 9:00am, Mom called again. Then a text. This is insane. Call us now. 9:00am, my neighbor Brenda texted me, everything okay at your parents house? Heard someone screaming. 9:00am, my doorbell rang. I looked through the people. Dad was standing there. Behind him in the driveway was my Honda. I opened the door. He was holding my keys. His face was red here. He shoved them into my hand. Your mother is very upset. Good. He opened his mouth like he wanted to say something else. Then he just turned around and walked back to the Lexus. I watched him drive away. Then I checked my car. Full tank of gas, detailed interior, even smelled like they'd had it cleaned.

He gets his nice, warm shower every time because I always remember to push the valve down. I'm the only one suffering here. Two days ago, it happened again. I woke up, went into the bathroom and turned on the shower without checking. The second that water hit me, I screamed. It was freezing, absolutely freezing. And I just stood there, dripping and shivering. And something inside me snapped. I turned off the water, grabbed the plastic cup we keep by the sink, filled it about three inches with cold water from the tap. Then I walked straight into the bedroom where my husband was standing completely naked. He just pulled off his pajama pants and was about to head to the bathroom for his turn in the shower. He was looking down at his phone, checking something. Didn't even see me coming. I raised that cup and whipped it at a 45 degree angle so the water splashed all over his chest and face. He gasped and jumped back and looked at me like I'd lost my mind. I told him his apologies weren't worth anything anymore. I said I was done listening to him pat himself on the back for getting better when this had been going on for 20 years. I said, the fact that it's an accident doesn't excuse it. I told him, from now on, every single time I take a cold shower, he's taking one Too, I said I refused to be treated like a second class citizen in my own house, and if he won't make changes to treat me better, then I'll make changes to treat him worse. He stood there dripping and stammered something about how that wasn't fair. I said what wasn't fair was being ignored for two decades. What wasn't fair was asking for the same basic thing over and over and never getting it. What wasn't fair was him getting comfortable hot showers every day while I played Russian roulette with the faucet. He grabbed a towel and said we needed to talk about this like adults. I said, we did talk about it like adults for 20 years, and it got me nowhere. I walked out and slammed the door. That was two days ago. Since then, he's pushed the valve down both times. But so have I for the last 20 years during my good streaks.

So I hopped on another flight and send these pics to wife, and now she is begging me to return. I was sitting at gate 35, honeymoon tickets in hand, when my phone rang. We've been married for exactly 72 hours. The wedding had been perfect. Expensive, but perfect. My wife Claire's name flashed on the screen, and I smiled, expecting her to tell me she was running late from the hotel. Hey, babe, where are you? Boarding starts in 20 minutes. Silence. Then her voice, tight and nervous. Jake, I can't make the flight. Stomach dropped. What do you mean you can't make it? Are you okay? It's Marcus, she said quickly. Marcus? Her ex boyfriend of five years. The one she swore was just a friend. Now, he texted me this morning there's an emergency with his mom. She practically raised me. I need to be there for him. I sat there processing our honeymoon. The Maldives, two weeks of all inclusive paradise that cost me $14,000. And she was canceling for her ex boyfriend's family emergency. Claire, we can reschedule visiting his mom when we get back. This is our honeymoon. Her voice got defensive. You don't understand. She might not have much time left. Marcus needs support right now. Then he can call his actual family or Literally, anyone else? Like, don't be selfish. I thought you'd understand. Selfish? Three days into our marriage, and I'm selfish for expecting my wife to join me on our honeymoon? So what am I supposed to do? I asked quietly. Just cancel the trip. We'll go another time. I'm really sorry, but this is important. She hung up. I sat there, staring at my boarding pass. Around me, couples were kissing, families were laughing, excited for vacations. I looked at my phone, at our wedding photos still fresh on Instagram, at the messages from friends and family congratulating us. Then something clicked. Strange, cold clarity. I wasn't canceling anything. I opened my laptop, went to the airline website, and changed my return ticket. Then I booked a completely different outbound flight, one way to Barcelona, leaving in three hours from a different terminal. I texted Claire, have a nice time with Marcus. I'll be fine. She responded immediately, thank you for understanding. I love you. I didn't reply. Six hours later, I was sitting at a tapas bar in Las Ramblas, watching the sunset paint the Mediterranean orange and pink. I posted a photo, just me, a glass of wine, and the caption, when life gives you a canceled honeymoon, you take yourself to Spain instead. First stop, Barcelona. My phone exploded. Claire called 14 times in 10 minutes. I declined everyone. Then the text started. Jake, what are you doing? You're supposed to be home. Why are you in Spain? We need to talk about this. I replied once. You had your emergency, I had mine. Mine was realizing what kind of marriage I just signed up for. Her messages got more frantic. Turned out Marcus's emergency was that his mom had a cold. Not dying, just a cold. Claire had driven four hours to comfort him, brought soup, stayed at his place. She called his mom personally, healthy as ever, confused why Claire said she was dying. By day three, I was in Seville. Flamenco shows, incredible food, making friends with other travelers. I posted.

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She'd put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning, after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day, I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling washed over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy, and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was. One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, he said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

When I was 11, my mom trusted me with all her heart. Because by that age, I had already Learned how to do my own laundry, how to cook a meal with only three ingredients, and how to wrap a tight blanket around myself at night. So it felt like someone was holding me. And it's not like my mom was absent from the home or anything. She just spent all her time locked in her room working on her art. And as for why her art was never enough to pay the bills, I just figured that she trusted me enough to make budget friendly choices. So even when I woke up in the middle of the night to gumshots or the 100 degree heat in summer because we had no AC, I felt a sense of deep pride. And whenever I went to my friends houses, I always cooked the entire house dinner. And they'd wake up to the house SPIC and span. Counters wiped, sofas hoovered, even got the dollar bills that fell in between the cushions. I'd always say things like, wow, your mom must be an incredible woman with how well she raised you. And I'd respond with a huge beaming smile, yes, she's the best. No one ever questioned why I was so underweight, why I wasn't able to sleep in a bed and instead always opted for the hardwood floor. Why I couldn't even get through a Sentence without apologizing. Always just thought I was mature and polite. So one day, when my mom came out of her room for the first time in days, I lunged towards her. Mommy, look at my report card. The teacher said I did really good. That's nice, honey, she said with a sigh, her tobacco breath burning my nostrils. Can you tell Mommy what day it is? Wednesday. I thought if I could make myself seem cheery enough, then she would finally love me in the way I wanted. Until suddenly she started thrashing around the place and punched a hole in the drywall. Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck! I thought it was effing Thursday. I thought the payout was today. When I walked up to her, she lifted her fist as if she was about to take her anger out on me. So I made sure to speak really quickly. Mom, I have 20 bucks. Immediately her face softened. Honey, you are the kindest, most mature girl a mother could ever ask for. But I didn't have time to save her the moment, because as soon as she snatched it from my hand, she walked over to the store to buy art supplies, came home, and went back to working on her art. Now, you may be wondering where I got the $20 from. Well, there was this rich kid at school who always had lunch money. He was mean to everyone anyway, hanging on kids that looked poor. I Started to keep a mental record of who I could take from and when. All for those brief moments when mom would emerge eating another $20, another $40, another fix of her art supplies. And like all preteens, breaking the law, I got cocky. After just three months, Miss Lee caught me. I already knew what was going down. When she called me into her office, I thought she was going to call the police or at least scream at me. But no. Instead, she asked me questions. Not an interrogation, more like making conversation. Her what's your favorite food? Me rice with ketchup. Her what do you and your mom like to do for fun together? Me some times, the day after she gets her government check and she does art in her room, I sit by the crack in her door and talk about my day. Her what time do you go to sleep at? Me at 2:00am, when my mom goes quiet. The entire time, I had a smile on my face. Just happy to talk to an adult that cared about me. But when I looked up, I saw it, her eyes filled with tears. She told me to wait there while she went to go get someone and handed me a Nintendo Switch to keep me occupied. And two hours later, I heard a knock on the door. It wasn't just Miss Lee, because it was Miss Lee with two police officers and a lady. In a suit. Who said she was from Family Services. They all had the same look, like they were trying to smile, but couldn't quite manage it. Sweetie, we're going to take a ride to your house. The lady said we need to check on your mom.

So I live with this girl Jenna, right? And she's got this thing where she eats literally everything in the fridge. Doesn't matter if it's hers or not. Every single time I go to grab something I bought, it's just gone. And she always has the same excuse. She's stressed, finals are coming up, or work was crazy, or her mom called or Mercury's in retrograde, whatever. She'd swear up and down she'd replace it. But that never happened. I started writing my name on stuff with a Sharpie. Didn't work. I tried buying the weirdest stuff I could find, like kimchi and sardines, thinking she wouldn't touch that. She ate those two. I was losing my mind. But I didn't want to start drama because we've been living together for almost two years and the rent was cheap. Then one day I spent like three hours making this tiramisu. I'm not even a good cook, but I'd had the worst week at work. My boss yelled at me in front of everyone for something that wasn't even my fault. And I just needed something to look forward to. I watched two YouTube videos to get it right. I even went to three different stores to find the fancy ladyfinger cookies. I put it in the fridge before bed, already imagining how good it was going to taste the next day after it set Overnight, I woke up the next morning, went to the kitchen and the container was sitting on the counter completely empty. Not even a spoonful left, just an empty dish and a sticky note that said, sorry, bad day, I owe you. I stood there staring at that note for a solid minute. I wasn't even mad at first. I was just confused. Like, how do you eat an entire tiramisu that clearly has someone's name on it and think a sticky note makes it okay? I didn't say anything to her. That day. I just went on Amazon and ordered a mini fridge with a lock on it. Spent like 200 bucks I didn't really have, but I didn't care anymore when it showed up three days later. I set it up in my room and moved all my food into it. Everything, my eggs, my yogurt, my leftovers, the fancy cheese I've been saving, all of it went into my locked fridge. Jenna noticed pretty much immediately. She came home from work that night and I heard her opening and closing the kitchen fridge like five times. Then she knocked on my door, hey, uh, where'd all your stuff? I stared at the screen. My blood seemed to freeze in that instant. It didn't feel like I was looking at a DNA report, but more like looking at a line of code that couldn't be decoded or a cold.

Who's actually wrong here? I'm 32 and engaged to Anthony, who's 34. We've been together for three years. He's got a 12 year old son, Alex, from his previous marriage, and I have a great relationship with both of them. I even get along fine with his ex most of the time. But here's where it gets weird. Every single Sunday, Anthony, his ex, and Alex do this whole family day thing, and I mean the whole day. They start with breakfast around 9:00am, then watch movies, play board games, go to the park. They don't wrap up until, like, 7 or eight PM. This tradition started before Anthony and his ex divorced, and they kept it going for Alex. I get co parenting, but spending 10 hours every Sunday together? That's basically just being a family without the marriage certificate. When we first started dating, I told Anthony I found it strange. She got defensive and said, Alex looks forward to it all week. What was I supposed to say to that? I'm not going to be the evil stepmom who ruins a kid's favorite day. So at first, I just stay in our bedroom or hide in the basement all Sunday. But after a few months, I realized I was basically a prisoner in my own house. I'd hear them laughing downstairs and feel completely Invisible. That's when I started leaving. I'd pack a bag and head out around 8:00am, come back after nine PM. Anthony never once asked where I was going, never even acknowledged that I was gone for 12 hours. I'd go golfing, hit up target, sit in Barnes and noble for hours, just killing time. Then, about six months ago, I ran into my ex, Ben, at a coffee shop. Ben and I dated five years ago and stayed friends. He just gone through a divorce and moved into a new apartment. We caught up and exchanged numbers. A few Sundays later, Ben invited me over. We hung out at his place, smoked, ordered Thai food, watched movies. It was comfortable and relaxing. Just two old friends hanging out. After that, it became my routine. Every Sunday I'd go to Ben's around 9:00am. We'd cook breakfast together, go hiking, play video games, watch shows. It was nice having somewhere to actually belong on Sundays. I never told Anthony because he literally never asked. Not once in six months. If he didn't care enough to ask, I didn't feel like I needed to explain. This went on fine until yesterday. Ben stopped by to drop off my phone charger I'd left at his place. Anthony answered the door and Ben handed it to him. Anthony came inside, holding the charger, looking confused. He asked why Ben had it. I said, because I left it at his apartment. His face went pale. He Demanded to know why I was at Ben's apartment, I said, that's where I spend my Sundays. Anthony completely lost it. Started yelling about how disrespectful it was that I'd been. See, currently spending time with an ex. How could I betray his trust like that? I actually started laughing because the irony was too much. I pointed out that he spends literally every single Sunday with his ex, and I've never said a word he said. That's completely different, because he's been up front about

My mom is the academic baddie of the family. She has three degrees and one PhD, all from Ivy Leagues. And whenever I won an academic award, she'd brag about it for weeks, say it was all because of her. That was her thing. It was like she still wanted to hang on to her glory days. Well, I wasn't going to be the one to ruin that. So when she wanted all of my college application essays to go through her first, I let her. After all, she was the one to get my GPA up to 4.2. But then something strange happened. No college was accepting me. And I never received a single rejection email, either. Instead, I got angry, sometimes even threatening ones. Like Harvard, who said my essay was a disgrace, or brown, who threatened to have me blacklisted from other schools. It was around this time that I started to notice the pattern. Every time I got rejected, she got this look in her eyes, like she'd known all along, like she wanted it that way. But there was only one college I actually wanted to go to. University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I never told my mom about it because it wasn't an Ivy League. I didn't want her to think I was a failure for not getting accepted into yet another college. But then something strange happened. I got an interview within just two weeks of Applying, they told me I was exactly the kind of student they were looking for. And that evening, I couldn't help myself. I did the craziest thing known to mankind. I told my mother. And despite everything, I still expected her to jump up with excitement or at least smile. But no. Instead, she just said, that's wonderful, sweetie, but don't get too excited. You don't want to be disappointed. I stared at her blankly. It was the first time I asked myself whether my mom really wanted the best for me. But then I reminded myself about all the hours she had put into making me study. How my GPA was only high because of her. So I told myself the same thing she's always said to me. That I was being ungrateful. But after a week, I finally snapped because my dream college told me I was the perfect candidate. But week later, I got the email from U N C. Charlotte. There it was, in plain red Ariel Font. Rejected. It was the nastiest email I had ever seen. Didn't even mention my grades. Just talked about my poor character. But I wasn't confused. I knew that somehow my mom was behind it. So I stopped telling her anything. Found a tiny school three states away that she never heard of, applied in secret, got in, packed my car the day after graduation, and left while she was at her stupid book club. The first few weeks, She called me every day, but I never picked up because every time she would leave me a cute little voice recording. One was five minutes long where she described how much of an embarrassment I was to the family name. Another said I was sabotaging everything she had worked for. And my favorite, that I was going to end up in a dead end job at 30 and end up dying alone like, mom, isn't that you? Lol. Anyway, I blocked her after that and most of my family took my side. Fast forward five years and I'm now a paralegal with an amazing salary and perspective job. I was in the middle of joking to my coworker about how we both thought we never get into college when she asked what my GPA was. 4.2 dash. What? She exclaimed, how the EF did you struggle to get in? Before I could even respond, she picked up her phone and called her dad. My dad's a college admission officer. Sorry, but I need to know what happened. I just smiled. Daisy had always been a little quirky. Daddy, do you know his Zephyr encounter my name. At this point, I was almost killed over from how hard I was laughing, swatting the phone to try and get her to give up. But as soon as he responded, my body went still from 2,019 to Harvard. Daisy was smiling, I wasn't. Yes, daddy, I knew your memory was still good. Why didn't she get

I put Jasmine's favorite drink at our table with a small bucket labeled Jasmine's Nuggets. Only because she always joked that I ate more than my share. When she walked in, she looked confused. Then she saw the setup and started laughing. That real laugh I hadn't heard in months. She sat down and immediately grabbed a nugget. You're being weird, she said. But she was smiling. I slid a folded napkin across the table. She Opened it. I'd written, sorry I went quiet. Sorry I made you feel unwanted. You stayed when you didn't have to. That's why I'm staying forever. She read it twice, then looked up at me with this expression. I couldn't read. That's when I pulled out the ring. It wasn't expensive. It was what I could afford, but it was real. She just stared at it, then at me. Then she started crying. Like full on tears streaming down her face. The employees started clapping. Some kid from another table ran over and handed her a napkin. His mom was trying to pull him back, but he was determined to help. Jasmine was nodding before I even asked the question out loud. Just nodding and crying and laughing all at once. She finally managed to say, yes, you idiot. Obviously yes. Then she grabbed my hand and said, but you still have to share the nuggets fairly. From now on, that it's non negotiable. We sat there for two hours after that, just talking like we used to. The employees brought us free biscuits to celebrate. Jasmine kept looking at the ring and crying again every few minutes. Happy crying, though. When we finally left, she stopped me in the parking lot. You know what the best part is? She asked. You didn't try to be someone else. You just remembered who we actually are. That's when I knew I'd done it right.

Jasmine and I had been together for four years, four solid years. And in all that time, we had one tradition. We never broke. Sunday nights at KFC, every single Sunday, it didn't matter if we were broke, tired or fighting about something stupid, we went to KFC. It started on our second date, actually. I was trying to impress her with some fancy Italian place, but they messed up our reservation. We ended up at the KFC across the street because everything else was closed. We sat there for three hours just talking and laughing over a bucket of chicken. She told me about her weird uncle who collects bottle caps. I told her about the time I accidentally dyed my hair green in 6th grade. It was perfect. After that, it became our thing, our spot. The employees knew us by name. They'd save our usual table by the window. Jasmine always got the same thing, corn, chicken, coleslaw and that fruit punch they have. I'd get whatever was on sale and we'd share everything anyway. But then things got hard, really hard. My mom got sick last winter, like hospital visits three times a week, kind of sick. My boss cut my hours because business was slow. I would stressed, broke and exhausted all the time. I stopped texting Jasmine back as fast, stopped asking about her day. Even our Sunday nights got quiet. I Just sit there picking at my food while she tried to start conversations that went nowhere. She never complained, though. She just kept showing up, kept asking if I was okay, kept trying. And I felt like garbage because I knew I was pushing her away without meaning to. One night she didn't order her usual. She just got a small drink and said she wasn't hungry. That's when I knew I'd really messed up. Jasmine never skipped food at KFC, never. I went home that night and couldn't sleep.

Before we head to the church, first thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral, and she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her, but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. At the cemetery, she literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would Mention how hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I know. Now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. People were talking about the babies who died. Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce, pregnant lady coming through or, baby on board needs to pee. There were, like, 30 people there grieving, and she's treating it like her personal pregnancy announcement party. But then she crossed the line. Rachel was sitting

Three days later, he was in handcuffs. Grandma Violet made me promise three things before she died. First, that I'd water her roses every Sunday, even after she was gone. Second, that I'd finish my nursing degree and not give up when things got hard. Third, that I'd watch out for something. She wouldn't explain, just said, I'd know it when I saw it. She squeezed my hand so hard when she said that last part, her fingers ice cold, but her grip desperate. And I promised, even though I didn't understand, she I Tuesday morning at 6:47 with me holding one hand and the hospital nurse checking her pulse with the other. And I thought that strange final promise would just be one of those deathbed things people say when they're scared and confused. Used I was wrong. The thing grandma warned me about showed up exactly three days later wearing an expensive suit I'd never seen before and demanding half of everything she'd left behind. My stepbrother, Garrett, walked into that lawyer's office on Friday morning looking like he'd won the lottery. And by Friday afternoon, he was in the back of a police car with his hands cuffed behind his back, screaming about his rights while his mother sobbed on the sidewalk. The story of how we got from point a to point B involves forged signatures, hidden cameras, a suspicious Rolex, and the fact that my grandmother was apparently way smarter. And way more parent more than any of us realized. Garrett showed up to Grandma's funeral on Wednesday wearing a suit that probably cost $3,000, which was weird because two months ago he'd called my dad begging for money to pay his electric Bill. Dad gave him $400, like he always did. And Garrett never paid it back. So like he always did. But now he had Italian shoes and a watch that caught the light every time he moved his wrist, this gold Rolex that he kept adjusting and showing off like he wanted people to notice. I noticed. I spent the entire funeral watching him work the room at the reception, shaking hands with Grandma's friends and accepting condolences like he was the grieving grandson there every day. The reality was different. Garrett had visited grandma exactly twice during her ten month cancer battle. Once at Christmas when his mom Patricia dragged him there for the obligatory family photo, and once in February for about 15 minutes when he needed to borrow Grandma's car because his truck was repossessed. I know because I was there. Three days is a week minimum, sleeping in the chair beside her bed, helping her to the bathroom at 3 a. M, holding her hand through the bad days when the pain medication made her confused and scared. Garrett ate potato salad and told people how much he'd miss her. And I wanted to throw something at his head, Patricia.

But there was only one college I actually wanted to go to, university of North Carolina at Charlotte. I never told my mom about it because it wasn't an Ivy League. I didn't want her to think I was a failure for not getting accepted into yet another college. But then something strange happened. I got an interview within just two weeks of Applying, they told me I was exactly the kind of student they were looking for. And that evening, I couldn't help myself. I did the craziest thing known to mankind. I told my mother. And despite everything, I still expected her to jump up with excitement or at least smile. But no. Instead, she just said, that's wonderful, sweetie, but don't get too excited. You don't wanna be disappointed. I stared at her blankly. It was the first time I asked myself whether my mom really wanted the best for me. Then I reminded myself about all the hours she had put into making me study, how my GPA was only high because of her. So I told myself the same thing she's always said to me, that I was being ungrateful. But after a week, I finally snapped because my dream college told me I was the perfect candidate. But week later, I got the email from U N. C. Charlotte. There it was in plain red, Ariel font, rejected. It was the nastiest email I had ever seen. Didn't even mention my grades, just talked about my poor character. But I wasn't confused. I knew that somehow my mom was behind it. So I stopped telling her anything. Found a tiny school 3 states away that she never heard of, applied in secret, got in, packed my car the day after graduation and left. While she was at her stupid book club for the first few weeks, she Called me every day but I never picked up because every time she would leave me a cute little voice recording, it was 5 minutes long where she described how much of an embarrassment I was to the family name. Another said I was sabotaging everything she had worked for and my favorite, that I was going to end up in a dead end job at 30 and end up dying alone. Like mom, isn't that you? Lol. Anyway, I blocked her after that and most of my family took my side. Fast forward 5 years and I'm now a paralegal with an amazing salary and perspective job. I was in the middle of joking to my coworker about how we both thought we never get into college when she asked what my GPA was, 4.2 dash. What? She exclaimed, how the e F did you struggle to get in? Before I could even respond, she picked up her phone and called her dad. My dad's a college admission officer. Sorry, but I need to know what happened. I just smiled. Daisy had always been a little quirky. Daddy, do you know his effery encounter my name? By this point, I was almost killed over from how hard I was laughing, swatting the phone to try and get her to give up. But as soon as he responded, my body went still from 2,019 to Harvard. Daisy was smiling, I wasn't. Yes, daddy, I knew your memory was still good. Why didn't she get.

She saw me staring and touch them almost defensively, grandma gave them to her last week as a thank you for all the help. I almost laughed. Patricia had shown up to the hospital twice, both times staying less than half an hour because the smell made her nauseated. She never helped with medications, never sat through a chemo appointment, never once offered to give me a break so I could go home and sleep my own bed. But there she was wearing my grandmother's pearls and smiling like she'd earned them. She leaned in close and said she hoped there wouldn't be any drama at the will reading tomorrow, that grandma had been very clear about wanting to be fair to everyone. The way she said fair made my stomach hurt. Dad stood across the room looking uncomfortable in his suit. And when I caught his eye, he looked away fast. That's when I knew something was wrong, really wrong, because dad only did that guilty look when he'd already chosen Patricia's side over mine and didn't want to face me. Got it. The lawyer's office Friday morning was downtown in one of those old buildings with marble floors and wood paneling that smelled like furniture polish and old money. I got there 20 minutes early and sat in the waiting area drinking Terrible coffee from a paper cup, trying not to think about the fact that this was really happening, that grandma was really gone and we were really about to divide up her things like she was just stuff to be sorted. Dad showed up 15 minutes later, his tie already loose, even though it wasn't even nine yet, and sat three chairs away from me without saying anything. Patricia and Garrett arrived exactly on time, both dressed like they were going to court. Patricia in a black pantsuit and Garrett in that expensive suit with the Rolex gleaming on his wrist. The secretary called us back at 9:30 and let us down a hallway into a conference room where a woman named Beverly Harrison sat behind a massive desk with a folder in front of her and reading glasses on a chain around her neck. She was probably 70 with perfect white hair and the kind of face that had seen too many families fight over money to be surprised by anything. She shook all our hands and said she was very sorry for our loss, that Violet had been a wonderful woman and a valued client for over 30 years. Then she opened the folder and the room got very quiet very fast. Full story is linked below or on my channel.

When my mom's new boyfriend moved in, I was 13. Dad had passed away eight days ago. He died from a heart attack. That made no sense. One day he was teaching me how to eat healthier and bragging about how he'd never smoked a day in his life. And the next, I was standing over his hospital bed while the monitor went flat. The first thing Mom's boyfriend, Cyrus did was drink from Dad's World's Best Father coffee mug. Mom poured it like it was already routine. But it wasn't just Dad's things he was claiming. Cyrus had this way of looking at me that made my skin crawl. His eyes would follow me across the room, lingering too long when I reached for something on a high shelf. He'd accidentally walk in while I was changing, apologizing with this smile that never reached his eyes. When I told mom he made me uncomfortable, she sighed like I was being difficult. Cyrus is just being friendly, Jasmine. Stop making this harder than it needs to be. But the more mom pushed me to accept Cyrus, the more questions started eating at me. I couldn't stop thinking about how healthy dad had been. He ran every morning, had his cholesterol checked monthly because he was paranoid about his family history. Doctor even joked he'd lived to be 100 So at dinner one night, I mentioned it. Dad never had heart problems before. Cyrus set down his fork, slowly, stared right at me and said, hearts are unpredictable. Sometimes they just stop. He said it like he was enjoying some private joke. Mom just snapped at me to stop dwelling on the past. I, I thought if I could just get proof, she would have to listen. So I started recording Cyrus on my phone when he'd make his creepy comments about me becoming a woman or how mature I looked in my school uniform. But he found it, grabbed my phone right out of my hands one day and deleted everything while maintaining eye contact. Then he showed mom the empty recordings folder and said, I've been trying to frame him. Mom took my phone away as punishment, said I was poisoning our fresh start. That's when things got worse. I started pushing my dresser against my door at night, but mom noticed. Why is your furniture moved? She demanded. When I told her I didn't feel safe, she actually removed my bedroom door. We don't keep secrets in this family. Cyrus started coming in whenever he wanted. Just checking on you, sweetheart, he'd whisper, sitting on my bed while I pretended to.

Could you not believe you had to explain to another parent? My neighbor banged on my door at 7 a m. Your son screams every weekend, and I'm done being polite about it. What are you talking about? The noise from your backyard. It happens every Saturday and Sunday like clockwork. The whole street hears it, and my daughter thinks someone is dying over here. My son has autism, and when he gets overwhelmed, he needs to let it out somewhere safe. Our backyard is private. I don't care what he has. She cut me off hard. This affects everyone, and my daughter is having nightmares about it. Then tell her. Some kids express themselves differently. I'm not explaining your problems to my child. She shot back. That's not my job as a parent. Her husband appeared behind her. We've tried to be understanding, but this can't continue like this. You've never said anything to us before. He held up his phone. I've been recording everything and sending it to the HOA for two months now. We have documentation. You're recording my son? For evidence? He said it flatly. This isn't normal behavior, and you know it. My son came to the door holding his tablet. He looked scared from all the yelling. The neighbor stepped backward fast. See? Even the way he moves is disturbing. Something's not right here. He started humming quietly. That's what he does when he's anxious. She pointed right at him. That sound right there. Hours of that every single day through our fence. I can hear it in my kitchen. He's 10 years old. He's not hurting anyone. My voice was getting tight. Her face turned bright red. My daughter can't sleep at night because she thinks your house is haunted. She told her entire class at school. I had to go in and talk to the teacher. Maybe explain that people are different instead of making him sound like a monster. She nearly yelled, I shouldn't have to teach my kid about your family's issues. That's on you. My wife pushed past me into the doorway. Our son exists, and that's not negotiable. You need to leave our property. The neighbor pulled out more papers from her pocket. I spoke to a lawyer about noise ordinances and disturbance laws. We have grounds here. You're threatening to sue us because our kid plays in his own yard? If you can't control him, maybe you should consider moving somewhere more appropriate for your situation. She said it like she'd been planning that line. My son's humming got louder, and he started rocking side to side. She pointed again with this triumphant look. This is exactly what I mean. This is what we deal with constantly. Our other neighbor jogged over from across the street. Everything okay? I heard shouting from inside my house. The woman spun toward her. Perfect timing. Maybe you can help.

El tenedor se detuvo a medio camino hacia mi boca cuando carraspeó la garganta de esa manera en particular, ya sabes, esa en la que alguien está a punto de soltar una bomba durante la cena y fingir que es una charla casual. He estado pensando. Di sin levantar la vista de su pollo perfectamente sazonado, el mismo que yo había pasado una hora preparando. Las cosas tienen que cambiar por aquí. Dejé el tenedor con cuidado. Siete años de matrimonio me habían enseñado a leer las señales de advertencia, la forma en que ajustaba su cuello, la leve pausa antes de hablar, el portátil estratégicamente colocado sobre la encimera. ¿Qué tipo de cambios? Pregunté con la voz más firme de lo que me sentía. Finalmente me miró y vi algo que nunca había visto antes. Día. Calculadora. Bueno, he estado haciendo cuentas y, sinceramente, este arreglo me parece justo. Qué arreglo este donde yo me rompo el lomo los días mientras tú, hizo un gesto vago hacia nuestra cocina. Impecable. Haces lo que sea esto. Las palabras cayeron como agua helada. Había dejado mi trabajo de marketing hace siete años, cuando nos casamos. Fue idea suya. De hecho, un hombre debe proveer a su esposa. Había dicho entonces quiero cuidar de ti. Yo había dudado. Amaba mi Carrera. Pero él insistió. Tanto. Tan romántico, tan seguro. Y ahora me miraba como si fuera una sanguijuela. He creado una hoja de cálculo. Continúo abriendo el portátil con el entusiasmo de quien presenta una brillante propuesta de negocios. He calculado todos nuestros gastos mensuales. Hipoteca, servicios, comestibles. Todo. De ahora en adelante, lo dividimos cincuenta. Cincuenta. La pantalla mostraba un desglose detallado de nuestra vida reducida a números. Hipoteca, dos mil novecientos cuarenta y siete servicios, trescientos cuarenta comestibles, quinientos ochentas. Seguro, cuatrocientos, veintes. Y la lista seguía. Cada ítem calculado con precisión. Pero yo no tengo trabajo, dije en voz baja. Tú me pediste que renunciara, ¿recuerdas? Él agitó la mano con desprecio. Eso fue antes. Esto es ahora. Eres una mujer inteligente. Puedes resolverlo. No estoy dirigiendo una caridad aquí. Lo miré a ese hombre al que había amado, cuyas medias lavaba, cuyas comidas cocinaba, cuya madre soportaba hacía siete años, y sentí algo cambiar dentro de mí.

The bartender of the hotel painted the same picture, except he added that Ava had begged him to use his phone. But Diana stopped her and had the closest Uber pick me up. Ava immediately. In hindsight, what Ava was doing was so unforgivable, I should have just reported her myself. But I still didn't know. So I spent the next three hours outside flagging down every driver that worked for the hotel. I showed Lynn's photo to every one of them until I found him. He recognized her immediately and whispered like he was scared. She had a black eye under makeup. Kept looking back like someone was following us. The address he went to was a beach house. I later found out that's the worst place Marco could have taken her to. My hands shook typing the address into Google Maps. When I got there, the first thing I noticed was the music. It was so loud I could feel it vibrating in my chest. I crept around to the back windows. That's when I actually saw her, Ava. She was wearing her friendship bracelets from summer camp, doing the same nervous habit of tucking her hair behind her ear while wearing this tight red dress I'd never seen and makeup that made her look 25. She was inside with a group of young girls. At first, my heart stopped. She looked in danger. I watched closer. One girl, maybe 16. Was crying in the corner. Ava walked over to her and knelt down. I thought she was helping her, but Ava's hand on the girl's shoulder wasn't comforting it. It's firm, controlling. I ran away, too, Ava was saying, her voice different, harder. Marco saved me. Trust me. This is better than home. Nobody's looking for you anyway. We're your family now. The girl kept crying. Ava stood up, annoyed, and walked to some men sitting on a white leather couch. They put money in her hand. She counted it like she'd done it 100 times, walked back and handed bills to each girl, keeping the biggest stack for herself. This wasn't my scared girl. This was someone running an operation. I kept watching as she directed the girls on where to stand, told one to smile more and another to stop looking so scared. It's obvious. My daughter, my baby who made me burnt pancakes. Two weeks Yo was recruiting and managing girls. That's when I knew her whole innocent thing was a facade.

Screamed that I brainwashed him, that I couldn't have kids, so I was stealing hers. They put her in the patrol car. Three days later, Sierra's brother Derek showed up. He's a lawyer. He handed me an envelope. You've been served. You don't stand a chance against a real lawyer. Custody petition hearing next week. I found a lawyer named Finley who'd take payment plans. At the hearing, Derek painted Sierra as a struggling mom who made one mistake. Then he submitted my mental health records from five years ago. Said I was unstable. The judge granted Sierra temporary custody. I had two hours to pack Eli's things. When we dropped him off, Sierra was smoking outside. She grabbed his hand roughly. You better know not to mess with me, she said, with a nasty smile. A week passed. At midnight, the doorbell rang. Eli stood there in his pajamas with a black eye. I pulled him inside. He was shivering and crying. Mommy's new friend Logan hit me. I was too loud, so I waited until they were asleep and walked here eight blocks alone. At four years old, I called 9 1 1. The EMTs documented everything. The black eye, finger marks on his arms, a boot shaped bruise on His back. In the morning, Finley filed an emergency custody petition. The black eye changes everything. By noon, Sierra showed up with Logan screaming. The same officer arrived. He recognized Logan immediately. Logan had a record. Assault, domestic violence, D U I. When they refused to leave, he cuffed them both. At the emergency hearing, Finley presented the abuse photos, police reports, Logan's record. he revealed Sierra had been collecting disability benefits for Eli. Claimed he had severe autism. She'd been pocketing thousands meant to help him. When Eli testified, he told the truth. Simply, Logan hit him. Mommy told him not to cry. He ran to us because that's where he felt safe. The judge terminated Sierra's parental rights completely two months later. At the finalization hearing, Eli yelled, I have a real family now. I held him tight while he buried his face in my shoulder. Sierra never appealed. Eli's five now and calls us mom and dad.

I said, I was in the middle of talking to you and you shut the door in my face. So, no. He started going off about how I was being immature and petty, how he pays for stuff, too, which is a complete lie. I just sat there and didn't say anything. He kept yelling and I could tell he was losing it because he couldn't get back online. Then he goes, fine, I'm telling mom. He actually called my mom at work. She came home like an hour later and She was furious, but not at him, at both of us. She started screaming about how she's losing her mind because her own kids can't get along. She said if she wasn't here, we'd probably kill each other. She was crying and yelling at the same time. It was pretty bad. Kevin didn't say anything. He just went back to his room. I turned the internet back on because my mom asked me to, but I didn't apologize. The next morning, Kevin had packed up a bunch of his stuff. He came out with two duffel bags and his backpack. My mom asked him where he was going. He said he was going to stay with his friend Tyler for a while or maybe our Aunt Janet, who lives across town. Janet has always let him get away with everything, so that made sense. My mom tried to get him to stay, but he said he needed space. He left and didn't say anything to me. That was five days ago. He hasn't come back yet.

They ate it up. Her mom was practically crying with joy, said I was the most thoughtful son in law ever, even offered to bring her famous potato salad. I left the house at 9:00am with my suitcase just like I said I would, waved goodbye to her from the driveway. She blew me a kiss from the doorway already in her silk robe, the one I bought her for Christmas. I drove around the block and park three, three streets over right where I could see our driveway, waited in my car with a coffee and a breakfast sandwich from the Corner Deli. At 10:00am, a silver BMW hold up. Didn't recognise the car, but I recognised his face immediately from the photos on her burner phone. Her project manager from work, the one she'd been texting, I miss you too. At 2:00am, while I slept next to her, I watched him walk up to my front door, watched her answer in that same silk robe, watched her pull him inside and close the door. I sat there for another hour, stomach turning, but I waited. Timing had to be perfect. Perfect. At 11:00am, I met her family outside our building. Her mom was holding a custom cake from the expensive bakery, white frosting with pink flowers that said happy 32nd birthday, Taylor. Her Sister had a bouquet of balloons. Her best friend carried a bag of presents wrapped in gold paper. Everyone was grinning, so excited to surprise her. I had my key ready, told everyone to be super quiet, that we'd sneak down the hall and really shock her. They were giggling like kids on Christmas morning. Her mom kept adjusting the candles on the cake. We walked in silent. I could hear music playing from the bedroom, her favorite playlist. Her mom was trying not to laugh, holding that cake with both hands. Her sister kept whispering, she's going to freak out. Her friend was recording on her phone. We made our way down the hall. I positioned everyone right outside the bedroom door. Her mom held up the 8:30, two candles flickering. Everyone raised their party horns, fingers on the triggers. I mouthed one, two, three, and threw open the door. The party horns went off at the exact same moment her mom dropped a cake.

So I texted him from her phone and pretended to be her to find out the truth for myself. My wife has this guy best friend from college who's still constantly in her life. His name is Cole. Never really bothered me, honestly, because I try. That changed at our wedding last month when my cousin overheard Cole talking to another one of their college friends at the reception. The friend was teasing him saying, man, you lost her. She was the one that got away. And Cole apparently snapped back with, please, I have her whenever I want her. My cousin wasn't sure if she should tell me but finally did. Three days into our honeymoon, I decided not to bring it up right away because I didn't want to ruin the trip we and planning for two years. But when we got back home, I couldn't shake it. I sat my wife down and told her exactly what was said. She looked me dead in the eyes and denied anything ever happening between in them. No hesitation, no defensiveness, just this weird calm energy. She said Cole probably said it to save face in front of their friends. It sounded reasonable enough and I had zero proof of anything so I tried to let it go. Two weeks later, we're driving to her parents house and my phone dies. I grab hers to make a playlist. For the drive since she's behind the wheel. While I'm scrolling through Spotify, I accidentally swipe over to her messages. That's when I see Cole's name in her recent contacts. But when I tap on it, there's literally nothing there. Completely empty thread. My heart started racing because I know for a fact they text all the time. She's always laughing at messages from him. But the entire conversation history was just gone. I didn't say anything in the moment because part of me still wanted to believe her. Maybe she accidentally deleted it or something, right? Wrong. That same night, I'm sitting on the couch and her phone lights up on the coffee table. It's a text from Cole. I see the preview notification. Clear as day. She goes to take a shower. I check her phone and pull up his contact again. Once again, completely empty. Not a single message. She was actively deleting their conversations in real time. Now I'm spy irritating. What could they possibly be talking about that needs to be erased immediately? I couldn't sleep that night. Around 2:00am, she's knocked out next to me and I make a decision. I grab her phone, open Cole's contact and send a message trying to sound exactly like her when she's bored late at night. Me, why? Him in bed, you, me, same. Can't sleep watching Netflix. Him, wish I was there with you. Then it escalated fast. Started saying things that made it crystal clear. This wasn't new territory for them. The way he talked, the things he referenced, it was obvious they'd had these kinds of conversations dozens of times before. I felt physically sick reading it, but I let it go on for maybe five more messages. Just have undeniable proof. I screenshotted everything, airdropped it all to my phone, and then I just sat there in the dark staring at the ceiling until morning. The second she left for work at 7:00am, I started packing clothes, documents, laptop, anything important I was out of.

Asked her why she didn't tell me she was making pie when she knew I was handling dessert. She said, well, we figured you'd do your own thing, so I wanted a backup. She cut into her pie and started serving slices to everyone, told me to leave the cheesecake in the kitchen. Jason's father in law asked if he could try my dessert. Mom literally said let's not mix too many flavors at once, like my cheesecake was going to ruin everyone's palate or something. I just stood there holding this cake I spent hours on. Everyone had pie in front of them. No one was looking at me. Mom pushed a plate with pumpkin pie toward my spot at the table. I put the cheesecake down, grabbed my coat from the hallway, said I had to go. Mom called after me asking what I was doing. Jason said my name in that tone like I was being ridiculous. I didn't turn around. I was already crying and I wasn't about to have a breakdown in front of everyone over a stupid pie. Drove home and sat in my car for 20 minutes. My phone started blowing up. Mom texted saying I was rude and immature for leaving on Thanksgiving of all days. Jason sent this long message about how I'm being irrational and making everything about myself. Dad called but I didn't pick up. The thing is It wasn't really about the pie. It was about mom deciding my effort wasn't good enough before anyone even tried it. It was about her always having a backup plan for me, like I'm going to mess up. It's about feeling like the family screwed up. At 32 years old, I texted mom back two days later, told her I'd apologise for leaving if she apologised for dismissing my dessert. She said I was being dramatic, that she was just trying to make sure everyone had options, that I'm too sensitive and need to grow up. Jason called and said I embarrassed him in front of his in laws, that Mom's getting older and I need to just deal with her quirks, that it was just pie. I haven't been back since.

I called my best friends pretending I was drowning in debt. One told me it was karma. Another said you're not my problem. But my childhood friend drove four hours to help me move my stuff. What I did next changed his entire future. My name is Connor. I'm 31 and I just sold my cyber security software to a Fortune 500 company for $90 Million after taxes. I built it alone in my garage. For three years nights I worked at a data center making $19 an hour. Days I coded until my eyes burned. No investors, no press, just me, caffeine and a dream that felt impossible. Most mornings the wire hit my account. On a Tuesday at two forty seven PM I was sitting in a Wendy's parking lot eating a $5 meal when my phone buzzed. I read the number three times and I put my head on the steering wheel and just breathed. I didn't call my mom, didn't post online, didn't tell anyone because I realized something sitting there with my cold fries. I had no idea who actually cared about me versus who cared about what I could do for them. For three years, I'd been the broke friend, the one who couldn't make bachelor parties or split Airbnb's. People stopped inviting me to things. I told myself it was normal. Life gets busy, but now with more money Than I'd ever imagined. I needed to know the truth. So I designed a test. I made a list of three people I'd known since college, people I'd helped, trusted, considered close. I wrote a simple script. Hey, I'm in trouble. My landlord's evicting me and I need help moving my stuff by Friday. Can you spare a few hours? That's it. No money involved, just time and effort. Thursday morning I called Derek first. Derek and I met freshman year. We were roommates for two years. I'd covered his rent twice when he was between jobs. I'd driven him to the airport at 4:00am more times than I could count. He picked up on the fourth ring. I gave him my script. He laughed. Not a polite chuckle, a real laugh. Bro, that's karma. You ghosted my fantasy league draft last month. Figure it out yourself. Then he hung up. I stared at my phone like it had just insulted me. Second call, Vanessa. We've been close since sophomore year. Study partners, concert buddies, the kind of friend who knew my coffee order. I'd helped her move twice, dog sat for her probably 15 times. I asked her the same thing. Silent.

Security detained me an hour later for suspicious behavior. When the airport director arrived, the little girl ran up and shouted, dad! That's the man who saved me! I was grabbing coffee at LAX Terminal 3 when I spotted her, maybe 6 years old, pink backpack, clutching a stuffed bunny that was dragging on the floor. She was crying near Gate B7, turning in circles like she was looking for someone. I glanced around. No parent rushing over, no adult even looking at her. Just hundreds of travelers buried in their phones or rushing past. I knelt down about three feet away. Hey, sweetie, are you lost? Where's your mom? She looked at me with these huge, terrified eyes, sobbed harder. I don't know. I went to look at the planes and now I can't find her. I stood up and scanned the area again. Still nobody. I couldn't just leave a six year old crying alone in an airport. I walked her to the nearest gate counter, keeping a respectful distance because I knew how this might look. A 30 something guy with a random kid. A gate agent's expression shifted when she saw us. She immediately picked up the phone. Security will be here in just a moment, sir. While we waited, the little girl kept crying. I asked the Hudson News nearby if I could buy her a hot chocolate. The cashier looked at me suspiciously. But rang it up. I handed it to the girl. She held it with both hands and took a small sip. What's your bunny's name? I asked. Mister Flops, she whispered. That's a great name. Mister Flops looks very brave. She nodded and hugged him tighter. Ten minutes later, a woman came sprinting around the corner, screaming, Emma! She drop her shopping bags and scooped up the girl, both of them crying. The woman turned to me with tears streaming down her face. Thank you. Oh, my god. Thank you so much. I was in the restroom and she must have wandered off. And I've been searching everywhere. And she's safe. That's all that matters, I said. She hugged me. The gate agent smiled. I grabbed my bag and headed to get 8 C two for my flight to Seattle. I had a client presentation at 9 the next morning. An hour later, I was reading emails when two TSA officers appeared beside my seat. Sir, we need you to come with us. Everyone around me stared. I felt my face get hot. What's this about? Just come with us, please. They walked me to a small security office. Windowless fluorescent lights, metal table, and three chairs. I sat down completely confused. Supervisor came in with a tablet. We received reports of suspicious behavior involving a minor. We need to ask you some questions. I helped a lost child find her mother. That's it? Why were you talking to her? She was crying and alone. Did you know the family? No

My girlfriend came home at 2:00am with her underwear and dress torn open screaming for me to help her. She collapsed into my arms and I could feel her whole body trembling. She kept throwing up and shaking all over our carpet. I help to the couch and got her a glass of water while trying to stay calm myself because I was sure my worst fear just happened. Juno is without a doubt the strongest person I know. She worked as a prosecutor and dealt with assailers, PDF files and slaughterers every day without flinching. But now she looked broken and small, literally rocking on our couch. She kept apologizing for ruining my night, which made no sense and I assured her she did nothing wrong. At the club, some guy had cornered her outside the bathroom when she was alone. According to her, he towered over her, was super muscular and his breath reek of whiskey. He pushed her against the wall and put his hands where they didn't belong while she screamed for help. The music was too loud and her friends were too far away. She tried to fight back but he already had his way with her. The worst part was what happened next. Luna found security and told them exactly what occurred. She pointed out the guy who was laughing with his friends near the VIP section. The bouncer just shrugged and said, what Do you want me to do without any witnesses, lady? he leaned in close and told her that the guy was the owner's nephew, so maybe she should just go home and sleep it off and that it probably wasn't that bad. I felt rage building in my chest as Juna explained how the manager said the same thing, how her friends wanted to call the police, but the staff threatened to ban them, all of them, from every club in a 5 mile radius for causing trouble. Literally. Other women at the club whispered that the same guy had done this before, but nothing ever happened. Place protected him because his uncle owned three clubs in the city. Juno was a prosecutor who put criminals away for a living, but even she knew this would go nowhere. Rich guys with connections didn't face consequences for raping women in dark clubs. There would be no cameras in that hallway and no witnesses willing to testify. The system she worked for every day had failed her completely. I held her while she cried and felt more helpless than ever before in my life. I didn't know people who could handle this kind of thing. There was nothing I could do that would touch that man. But then I remembered that my father would know what to do. My dad had spent 30 years working construction in the roughest parts of the city. He knew people from a different world than Mine, people who handled problems outside the law when the law wouldn't help. I'd spent my whole life trying to distance myself from that part of his past, but now I needed it. The next morning, while Juno was sleeping, I drove to my parents house. My dad was drinking coffee in the garage, like always, surrounded by his tools and old boxing trophies. I told him everything and watched his face go from confused to furious. He sat down his mug so hard it spilled everywhere.

I drive up to the doctors and park. My hands are shaking and my mind can only hear my mom's voice saying, you're faking it. I take a deep breath to try and calm my nerves before I push open the door. The receptionist gives me the paperwork to fill out, which was easy before I was placed into a waiting room. The doctor finally comes in. You have been in constant pain since you were 7? Yes. Everyday. I've noticed stress makes it worse. Also if I don't get enough sleep. I watch closely to make sure he doesn't think I was lying. Why haven't you gotten a diagnosis or treatment for this in the past? I swallow the lump in my throat. My mom told me I was faking. A tear rolls down my eye before I swipe it away. No, you are not faking anything. I can see the muscles in your arms twitching from here. The doctor states with an empathetic tone, we are going to run some tests. Blood work and muscle tension and reflex tests. Okay. My head drops. Thank you. No, thank you for being brave enough to take care of your well being. The doctor states. The blood work was easy. The muscle tests had me screaming in absolute pain, though. I pushed through the tests before a nurse gave me heavy painkillers. Then I am back in the waiting room. That's when I hear my mom screaming. Where Is that lazy no good child of mine? I start shaking as my nerves return. Ma'am, you can't do that! The receptionist yells right back. Then my door bangs open to see my mom's red face, and I flinch back. Why are you wasting the doctor's time here? I'm not, I say softly. You are a liar! My mom yelled at me before the doctor stepped in. She is not faking. My head snaps up to the doctor. She has muscle atrophy and it's from malnutrition. So I should be blaming you as the mother you are not, nor have you taken care of your children. My mom's mouth is dropped open as I stare between the doctor and my mom. I turned to my mom in anger. You knew? Oh, of course not. My mom stutters. The doctor shakes his head. You are lying. My mom looks at us before turning tail and runs away. We will start treating you. The doctor squeezes my shoulder. I am sorry for your diagnosis, cause you will have it for life. We'll start treatment to make the pain better and try to help you relax the muscles. I just nod. I moved out of my mom's place and adopted my sister from CPS. She was never going to be our mom again.

Phone gone, wallet gone. The $340 in cash I just withdrew for rent, gone. Our neighbor, Missus Lee, was getting her newspaper. Oh, honey, are you okay? I saw someone going through your things around midnight, but I thought you knew them. I asked if I could use her phone, called my husband voice mail, called Ava's number that I'd memorized from seeing it so many times. She answered, is my husband there? He left for work like an hour ago. Why? He stayed there all night, went straight to his job, didn't check on me once. I called James sobbing. He picked me up in 10 minutes, took me to the police station to file a report, then to his lace. While I showered, he called a locksmith. Buddy, want me to change your locks today, James asked my tree. I nodded. Two hours later, new locks installed. James made me soup and let me sleep in his guest room. When I woke up at four PM, my husband had called James's landline seven times. I called back at eight PM he answered immediately. Where the hell are you? I'm locked out. I changed the locks. What? Why? You left me unconscious on our porch. I got robbed. You didn't even check if I was alive. That's not fair. I didn't know. You knew I was sick. You knew I needed to get inside. You chose Ava over me. This is insane. I need My laptop. I have a presentation due at midnight for the Kirkland account. I remembered that account. 6 months of work, make or break for his promotion. Come get the key tomorrow. Tomorrow. Are you serious? I'll lose my job. Not my problem. You said that to me last night. Remember, you're being a child and you're being locked out. Good night. I hung up, blocked his number. James ordered pizza and we watched a rest of development until I fell asleep on his couch. The next morning, James drove me to our house. My husband's car was still in the driveway. He was sitting on the porch, exactly where I'd been 24 hours earlier, looking destroyed. I walked up with the new key and a vanilla envelope. You lost the Kirkland account, I asked. He nodded, not looking at me. I handed him the envelope. Divorce papers I printed at James's place that morning. Here's your key, I said, setting it on the step. Maybe Ava has a couch you can sleep on while you look for a new place. He finally looked up. You're really doing this? You left me on the street. The choice was already made. I walked back to James's car and didn't look back.

My landlord's evicting me and I need help moving my stuff by Friday. Can you spare a few hours? That's it. No money involved, just time and effort. Thursday morning, I called Derek first. Derek and I met freshman year. We were roommates for two years. I'd covered his rent twice when he was between jobs. I'd driven him to the airport at 4:00am more times than I could count. He picked up on the fourth ring. I gave him my script. He laughed. Not a polite chuckle, a real laugh. Bro, that's karma. You ghosted my fantasy league draft last month. Figure it out yourself. Then he hung up. I stared at my phone like it had just insulted me. Second call, Vanessa. We've been close since sophomore year. Study partners, concert buddies, the kind of friend who knew my coffee order. I'd helped her move twice, dog sat for her probably 15 times. I asked her the same thing. Silence. And Connor, I have Pilates at noon and honestly, you're kind of not my problem anymore. We haven't even talked in months. Her tone wasn't mean. It was worse. It was indifferent. I sat there feeling like an idiot for even trying. Third call, Benji. He gave me a holographic Charizard because he said I looked sad that day. We've been friends for 19 years. He answered on the first ring. When and where? I gave him an address, four hours away in Another state. Hey, just you, I said, my throat tight. He didn't ask why I was being evicted or what happened. He just started loading boxes. They were fake boxes, old textbooks, kitchen junk I'd pulled from my garage. He never questioned it. We drove back in silence for the first hour. Then he bought me breakfast at a truck stop and said, you'll land on your feet, man. You always do. I almost told him right there. That afternoon, I called my lawyer and had her draft the paper paperwork. By Monday morning, Benji had a $2 million trust fund in his name, full college tuition covered for his two kids, and a 10% partnership offer in my next venture. I didn't make a big announcement. I just texted him, check your email, read everything. He called me 20 minutes later crying so hard he couldn't speak. When he finally got words out, he Said, Connor, what did you do? I'm just giving it to someone who showed up. I said, Derek and Vanessa found out 3 months later through a LinkedIn post. I didn't even write. My lawyer made it. Both sent long texts apologizing, asking to reconnect, saying they'd had a rough week back then. I left them unread.

That's not just cheating. That's psychological torture. I picked up her Costa Rica itinerary from the counter. Your trip is canceled. You're grounded until you tell Luke the truth. You can't do that. Everyone's going. I'll be the only one left behind. You should have thought about consequences before you decided to betray someone who trusted you completely. She screamed that I was ruining her life, that it wasn't fair that she was 18 and could make her own choices. You're right. I said you can make your own choices, but I don't have to fund them. And I'm not going to finance a Celebration for someone who treats people this badly. The next morning, Celeste tried a different approach. She came downstairs in tears, promising she'd break up with Nathan and focus on Luke. But I'd heard her on the phone the night before, laughing with Nathan about how dramatic I was being. I called the travel company and canceled her trip. Lost the deposit, but I didn't care. That afternoon, Luke showed up at our house with flowers for Celeste. Having no idea what was coming, I watched through the window as Celeste told him she needed space before college. She couldn't even be honest. Luke was devastated. Kept asking what he'd done wrong, if he could fix it. So let's just kept saying it wasn't his fault. Which, technically was true. The real kicker? Two days later, Nathan posted A photo on Instagram of him and Celeste together at some fancy restaurant. Luke saw it and put the pieces together himself. Called me that night, crying. Missus Johnson, did you know? I couldn't lie to him. I found out recently. Luke, I'm so sorry. I was going to propose to her after graduation, he said. I thought we were going to get married someday. My heart broke for this kid. Luke, I know this hurts, but you deserve someone who chooses you every single day. Celeste isn't that person. Celeste Senior Trip Group left for Costa Rica Yesterday. She watched from their Instagram stories as all her friends posted how excited they were for this trip. She keeps saying I'm the worst mother ever. That I've embarrassed her in front of everyone, that she'll never forgive me. But Luke texted me this morning.

I didn't want some fancy do over moment. I didn't want to pretend our relationship was something it wasn't. We weren't 5 star restaurant people. We were KFC people. And I love that about us. So I called the manager, explained everything and asked if I could do something special. He thought it was hilarious but said yes. I came in early that Sunday and set things up. I put Jasmine's favorite drink at our table with a small bucket labeled Jasmine's Nuggets only because she always joked that I ate more than my share. When she walked in, she looked confused and she saw the setup and started laughing, that real laugh I hadn't heard in months. She sat down and immediately grabbed a nugget. You're being weird, she said, but she was smiling. I slid a folded napkin across the table. She opened it. I'd written, sorry I went quiet. Sorry I made you feel unwanted. You stayed when you didn't have to. That's why I'm staying forever. She read it twice, then looked up at me with this expression. I couldn't read. That's when I pulled out the ring. It wasn't expensive. It was what I could afford, but it was real. She just stared at it, then at me. Then she started crying, like full on tears. Streaming down her face. The employees started clapping. Some kid from another table ran over and handed her a napkin. His mom was trying to pull him back, but he was determined to help. Jasmine was nodding before I even asked the question out loud, just nodding and crying and laughing all at once. She finally managed to say, yes, you idiot, obviously, yes. Then she grabbed my hand and said, but you still have to share the nuggets fairly from now on. That's non negotiable. We sat there for two hours after that, just talking like we used to. The employees brought us free biscuits to celebrate. Jasmine kept looking at the ring and crying again every few minutes. Happy crying, though. When we finally left, she stopped me in the parking lot. You know what the best part is, she asked. You didn't try to be someone else, you just remembered who we actually are. That's when I knew I'd done it right.

I'm done doing this every morning just to get told it's wrong. She turned around fast. Are you serious right now? Yeah, I'm serious. I've been making you coffee for two years and you never complained once until three weeks ago. Now suddenly I can't do anything right. She said I was being dramatic, that she just wanted her coffee made properly and I should care enough to do it the way she likes. I told her there's a difference between having preferences and standing over someone like a supervisor checking their work. She grabbed her cup and went to the bedroom. The next morning, I made coffee for myself. Only came out and saw one mug on the counter. Really? She said, you're actually doing this? I shrugged. You said, I don't make it right, so I'm saving us both the trouble. She made her own coffee in silence, playing everything, timing everything, doing her whole routine. It took her 15 minutes. She was late for work. This went on for four days straight. She'd make her elaborate coffee every morning, shooting me looks the whole time I drink mine and leave for work. On Friday, she didn't make coffee at all, just grabbed her keys and left without saying anything. Saturday morning, I woke up to find her sitting at the kitchen table with two mugs in front of her. I made coffee, she said quietly. For both of us. I sat down and took a sip. It was good. Obviously, she'd done her whole process. I think I got a little crazy about the coffee thing. She admitted it started because my coworker keeps talking about her husband's perfect coffee and I wanted ours to be that good, too. I looked at her. So this was about impressing your coworker. She laughed a little. When you say it like that, it sounds stupid. It kind of is, I said. She nodded, I know. I'm sorry I turned something nice into a chore. Monday morning, I made coffee again. I weighed the grounds because honestly, the scale was already out. I skipped the mug warming and just poured. When I handed it to her, she took it without asking a single question. She drank the whole thing and said, thanks. That was it. No inspection, no quiz, no dumping it out. We were finally back to normal.

My daughter was the most important person in my life. And up until her 18th birthday, she was the most wholesome girl I could ever ask for. We still watched Gilmore Girls every Friday. She still slept with her stuffed bear named honey she'd had since she was 3. Then came the night she said she was sleeping at her friend Dilly's house to finish college applications. Fine by me. She'd been stressed about essays all week. But the next morning, Dilly's mom called. Ava never showed up. My stomach dropped and I ran to her room. Honey was still on her bed, but her drawers were open, clothes missing. That's when I found it, a printed bus ticket to Miami leaving in 2 hours. I drove to the bus station doing 90. The security guard remembered her immediately, said she looked nervous, was talking to some older girls by the Miami bus. It was one of those moments no one could prepare before. But I knew from watching so much true crime that the police probably wouldn't do anything since she was 18. So I called her best friend, Laurel. She broke down immediately. Missus K. She made me promise not to tell. Laurel was sobbing. She met some guy online, Marco. He said he could get her a modelling job in Miami. I told her it was sketchy. I begged her not to go. I drove straight To Laurel's house. She showed me the texts. Marco saying Ava had the perfect look and sending her a bus ticket. The messages went back three weeks. This was my baby girl who still asked if I could take the green leaf out of her strawberries for her. I booked the next flight while sitting in Laurel's driveway. And four hours later, I was in Miami International Airport. The main bus station there smelled like vodka and the employee at the counter remembered Ava right away. That should have been my first warning. Young girl with a teddy bear keychain. He looked genuinely worried. She kept talking about cheap hotels, but those girls with her kept answering for her. Looked like a runaway. They took her passport and phone. That's what they do with the new ones. I wanted to throw up. I asked for the name of the cheap hotels Ava had mentioned. The first two I tried, didn't mention anyone who looked like Ava. If I knew what I know now, I would have given up on her. I rang the third hotel and described her and the manager paused. After a minute, she said she saw someone who looked like my Ava crying in the lobby. Apparently, Ava kept sobbing because she owed them for the room when she tried to use her phone.

She tells him through the doorbell camera that she's the new owner and he should mind his business. I call my property management company, the one that technically owns the house because it's corporate housing. I'm stationed here through work. They flip. They start the legal process immediately. I book the earliest flight home. 16 hour trip. No sleep. Just rage. I have the deputy meet me at my door. The locks have changed. I ring the doorbell. My sister answers, looking relaxed, happy even. Then she sees me and the sheriff, and her face drops. Goes, what are you doing here? I hold up the eviction notice. What are you doing here? She crosses her arms. We have squatters rights. We've been here over a week. The deputy laughs. He goes, ma'am, that's not how that works. I step forward. You don't have squatters rights. I don't even own this house. Her face goes pale. I explain slowly, this is corporate housing. My company owns it. You're not squatting in a residence. You're trespassing on commercial property. She starts stuttering. Her husband appears behind her, panicking. Deputy pulls out his cuffs and tells them they're being arrested for commercial trespassing. Then it gets better. Or worse. Depends on your perspective. For her husband works for a tech firm. His boss, my golf buddy Keith, he heard about the situation from a mutual friend and calls me directly to apologize. Then tells me her husband's getting demoted. Can't have someone with that kind of judgement in a senior role. My sister, screaming, now crying. Says I'm ruining their lives. I turn to the deputy. I want her arrested. She gets cuffed. Husband too. Kids get picked up by C P S. Temporarily until family. Later I find out they lost their rental. Didn't pay rent because they thought they'd be staying at my place. Got evicted from their actual apartment. They moved in with the husband's parents. Her husband got demoted like I. His reputation at work completely tanked. Nobody trusts him. My sister tried apologizing. Sent me this long email about how she always envied my success. How she thought if she just lived in my house, she'd feel successful, too. Golden child syndrome, except in reverse. She said she's in therapy now, learning about boundaries. I didn't respond. I found Apollo three weeks later. Neighbor four streets over had been feeding her. She's home now. Traumatized, but home. Never letting my sister near anything I love again.

So I shut the internet off. So my brother Kevin is 26 years old and still lives at home. He doesn't have a job. He's not in school full time either. He's been doing this bachelor's degree for literally 10 years now when it's supposed to take four. Every year he tells my mom he'll graduate in three years. He's sick and tired of hearing it. I pay for the internet in our house. Kevin pays for absolutely nothing. Zero. My mom is a single parent and she's been letting him slide for way too long. The guy spends probably 16 hours a day online gaming, watching videos, doing whatever. He barely leaves his room. The worst part isn't even the fact that he contributes nothing. It's that he acts like he's better than everyone. He talks to us like we're idiots. He uses all these psychology terms he Learned from his classes and acts like he's some kind of expert on everything. Like he'll say stuff like, that's a cognitive distortion or you're projecting when my mom asks him to do the dishes. So annoying. He also just ignores us half the time. My mom will call him to help bring in groceries and he'll pretend he doesn't hear. I'll knock on his door to ask him something and he'll just say busy and not open it. When we have Family dinner, which is like once a week at this point because he always has an excuse. He sits there on his phone the whole time. Anyway, Last Tuesday, I needed to talk to him about something. Garbage disposal was broken and making this grinding noise. My mom was at work and I figured since he was home doing nothing, he could at least look at it with me. I went to his room and knocked. He said, what? Through the door. I opened it and he was at his computer with his headset on playing some game. I said, hey, the garbage disposal is broken. Can you come look at it with me real quick? He didn't even turn around, just kept playing. I said, Kevin, did you hear me? He goes, yeah, I heard you. I'm in the middle of something. I said, dude, it'll take like.

By 25, I had an accounting job and my own apartment. I started dating someone who cared about me. But the guilt was killing me. I couldn't sleep and would wake up sweating, thinking about my sister in that wheelchair because of what I did. My girlfriend found me on the bathroom floor having a panic attack. She told me I needed help. I started seeing a therapist, and after three sessions, she stopped me and asked something that threw me off. She said, do you actually remember what happened that day, or do you just remember what people told you happened? I sat there frozen because I realized I didn't remember the fall at all. I only remembered my mom telling me I caused it. That night, I called my old elementary school. My hands were shaking. They said the incident report was archived and would take a few weeks to find. Those three weeks felt like forever. I barely slept. When the email finally arrived, I stared at it for 10 minutes before I could open it. I was terrified it would confirm everyone was right about me. I finally opened it and started reading. There were five witness statements from teachers and students. Everyone said the same thing. I was on the opposite side of the playground playing with other kids when My sister fell. She climbed the monkey bars alone, got to the top, lost her grip and fell. The supervisor wrote that I ran over after she was already on the ground screaming. I just sat there staring at the screen. I got in my car and drove to my parents house. I walked in without knocking. I held up my phone with the report and said I was on the other side of the playground. Five witnesses say so. I wasn't even near her. My mom stood up and her face went white. My dad sat there frozen. I said louder. You told me I distracted her. You told me it was my fault for 20 years. My dad's voice came out quiet. He said, we got that report the day after. We knew you weren't involved. I felt like I'd been punched. I asked, why lie to me? He wouldn't look at me. He said we needed someone to blame. We were falling apart. You were just there. So we blamed you. Then my sister's voice came from the hallway. She said, I saw you running over after I hit the ground. I've known this whole time you didn't cause it. I walked out without saying another word. My parents have sent 12 letters, but I haven't opened them. My sister calls every morning, leaving voicemails, crying and begging me to forgive her. But they destroyed me for 20 years when I was just a kid who didn't Do anything wrong last week? I blocked all their numbers

My ex wife texted me last Tuesday asking if we could talk about something important. I knew it was gonna be bad because she only uses that tone when she wants something unreasonable. We've been divorced for six years now, and the whole thing was a disaster from start to finish. Cheated on me with some guy from her work, and then three months later she's pregnant and swearing up and down it's mine. I told her, fine, but I'm getting a DNA test the second that kid is born. Two weeks later, she suddenly had a miscarriage. Except I found out from her sister that she actually got an abortion because she knew that baby wasn't mine. Then she had the nerve to tell everyone. I stressed her out so much, I made her lose the baby. Divorce got ugly real fast after that. We have two sons together. Tyler is 11 and Jason is 9. We split custody fifty 50, which I fought hard for because she wanted full custody and was asking for a stupid amount of child support plus alimony. She didn't get the alimony, and the child support was way less than she wanted because the judge saw right through her lies. He remarried some guy named Glenn about three years ago. He already had two kids from his first marriage. A 13 year old Girl and a 10 year old boy. Then her and Glenn had a baby together last year. So now there's five kids total in that house. Here's the thing. I make good money. I'm an engineer and I've been at the same company for 12 years. I got promoted twice since the divorce, and I'm doing well. My house is nothing crazy, but it's nice. Three bedrooms, and I turned the basement into a gaming setup for the boys. They've got a PlayStation, an Xbox, a good TV, a mini fridge down there with snacks and drinks. Their friends come over all the time and they basically live in that basement on weekends. My ex wife and Glenn are not doing as well. He works in retail management and she does some kind of administrative assistant job. They rent a smaller house and all five kids are crammed in there. The boys share a room with Glenn's son when they're over there. They've told me it sucks because there's no privacy and the baby cries all night. I take my kids on trips. Went to Disney World in July for 10 days. We stayed at one of the resort hotels, went to all four parks, did the character dinners, bought them whatever souvenirs they wanted. It cost me a fortune, but they had the time of their lives. Then in August, my parents wanted to do a big family reunion trip. So we all went to a lakehouse upstate.

I knew something was off when she started working late every Tuesday. At first, I believed her. She's always been dedicated to her career. But then the little things started piling up. She'd come home smelling different, not perfume exactly, but like someone else's laundry detergent. Her phone was suddenly password protect. Did after eight years of marriage. And she started going to the gym at weird hours. Ten PM on a Wednesday. Really the breaking point was finding the second phone in her gym bag. I was looking for her water bottle to wash it and there it was, a cheap prepaid phone still logged into everything, messages, photos, hotel reservations, all of it. Here's what I Learned in that moment. Don't confront. Immediately, I wanted to scream. I wanted to throw that phone against the wall and demand answers. But something in me said to wait, document everything first. So I did. For three months, I played the perfect Husband. I screenshotted every text on that burner phone when she was in the shower. I saved receipts from hotels I'd never been to, restaurants we'd never eaten at. I tracked her late nights on a calendar, built an airtight case and handed it all to a lawyer. My attorney loved me, said most guys come in with nothing but suspicion. I came in with a legal nuclear weapon. Her birthday rolled around in October, Three months into My silent investigation. I asked what she wanted to do and she got this strange look on her face, said she wanted me to go visit my brother for the weekend. Said she just wanted a quiet day at home, maybe order takeout and watch movies. Didn't wanna be reminded she was getting older. I knew that was complete garbage. She loves her birthday. Last year she had a party with 40 people. That morning I found champagne hidden in the garage, the expensive kind, $200 a bottle, two crystal glasses wrapped in tissue paper tucked behind the paint cans. Candles, too, the fancy ones from that boutique store downtown she always dragged me to. Something in me snapped, but not in an angry way, in a calculated way. So I called her mom, then her sister, then her best friend from college, the one who was in our wedding, told them all the same story. I wanted to throw her a surprise party.

Fiona looked hurt but couldn't say anything until it was speech time, where she emphasized that she and Pedro weren't just friends, they were best friends. She ended her speech saying, I love you, Pedro, while making this intense eye contact that only made him want to crawl under the table and hide. Instead, even his mom had her hand over her mouth. The rest of the guests sat stiff in their seats, having a hard time hiding how much they hated her. But Fiona misread their stairs for admiration. And when she watched Pedro step away from me on the dance floor, she thought she had won him back. I watched her slip out to the hallway, hand on her phone, looking absolutely giddy, clear, bragging to her friend about the successful day. She was far enough away that she probably thought no one could hear her. That's when I sent one of my little nieces to go over there and hand Fiona a microphone. The little girl was so sweet about it. She approached Fiona and lightly tugged on her dress. Excuse me, miss, she said softly. Fiona didn't even look at her. She just rolled her eyes at the girl and said, don't you see I'm on the phone? The little girl stood there a while longer, waiting for the call to end before tugging on Fiona's shirt again. This time, Fiona harshly snapped at the kid to go away. The thing was the microphone. Had been live the entire time. The sound system had picked up everything from cursing out an innocent kid to telling her friends that Pedro was always hers. I've broken up three of his relationships before. I can do it again. When Fiona walked back into the party, the entire room had gone silent. Everyone was staring at her with complete. Pedro's mom was standing with her arms crossed. Pedro looked absolutely betrayed. You should leave, Pedro's mom said, her voice practically trembling with anger. Other guests quickly piled on. That's psychotic. Did you really just brag about ruining his relationships? This is why you'll always be just a friend. Fiona stood there with her mouth hanging open, trying to come up with an excuse, but it was too late. Pedro was done with her. Delete my number, lose my address. Don't ever show yourself in front of me ever again, he said, pointing to the door. Fiona begged and tried to blame me. She, she plan, she set me up. I smiled. She was right, of course. But no one believed her. Not anymore. You set yourself up. She gave you a chance to be a decent person, to be happy for me, but you couldn't even manage that for one night. The venue security escorted her out while she sobbed. But just as I thought I had gotten away, Pedro later pulled me close and whispered. Full story on channel linked below.

I invited my entire family. Not one showed up. The next week, my sister posted her baby shower. A hundred dollar gifts minimum, not even a sorry we missed it. So I mailed her a one dollar card that said, congrats on teaching me. Who's family? I blocked every number. Three days later, my mom called from the hospital asking why no one came to her surgery. I'm Iris, single mom, work from home doing medical billing. My daughter Rosie is 7 and had been rehearsing for the Three Little Pigs for two months straight. She was pig No. 2, 4 lines total. She practiced them in the shower, at breakfast, in the car, in her sleep. She'd recite them to the cat. I sent the invite three weeks early. School auditorium, Thursday at 6:30 p. M. I texted the family group chat with a photo of the flyer added Rosie's first play. She's so excited to see everyone. Mom replied first, wouldn't miss it. I'll bring flowers. My sister Lauren texted back with three heart emojis and Omg, can't wait. My brother Dylan said he'd recorded on his good camera. I felt something lift in my chest. Maybe this time would be different. The week before I confirmed still good for Thursday. I asked in the chat, mom, of course. Lauren, yeah. Dylan, thumbs up emoji. Show night. I got there early and saved them. Front row seats, four chairs in. The center. I draped my jacket over one, Rosie's backpack over another, my purse across two. The auditorium filled up fast. Parents with camcorders, grandparents with flowers, siblings squirming in their seats. Six twenty five PM, I checked my phone, nothing. Six thirty PM, lights dimmed. I pulled my stuff off the seats. A mom with a toddler asked if they were taken. I hesitated then shook my head. She sat down. Rosie peeked through the curtain before the show started, scanning the crowd. I waved, gave her a big thumbs up. She didn't smile back, just ducked behind the curtain again. The play started. Rosie delivered her lines perfectly. I clapped so loud my hands stung, recorded every second on my phone. When she took her bow, I stood up and cheered alone. After the show, kids swarmed into the lobby. Families hugging, taking photos, handing out flowers. Rosie walked over to me holding her paper pig ears. Her eyes were scanning the crowd. Did they get lost? She asked quietly. I checked my phone. Group chat, silent since Tuesday. I opened Instagram, Lauren's story from two hours ago. Mimosas at a table by a window. Sunday, fun day with my people. Except it was Thursday. My mother was in the background laughing with a drink in her hand. Dylan's arm visible in the corner holding a beer. I knelt down and hugged Rosie. I don't know, baby. She nodded, didn't cry, just said, can we get ice cream? We got ice cream. I didn't text them. I didn't call. I waited. Six days later, my phone lit up. Lauren's baby shower invite, pink glitter borders. Venmo required 100 dollar minimum for the group gift registry links, a note at the bottom.

My daughter stopped coming home because she said I made her compete for my attention with a dead woman. It started when she made varsity swim team as a sophomore. Only three underclassmen made it that year. She came home waving the acceptance letter. Dad, I made varsity. I was standing in the hallway, the one covered floor to ceiling with photos of my late wife, wedding pictures, her high school swim trophies, beach vacations. I'd spent two weekends building it. After the funeral, I looked at a photo of my wife teaching our daughter to swim when she was 3. Your mom would have been so proud. She taught you in that exact pool. Remember? My daughter's smile faded. Yeah, dad. I remember. She went to her room. I heard the door closed. That became every single conversation. When she made honor roll, I showed her my wife's valedictorian plaque. When she won regionals, I pulled out a box of my wife's medals and spread them on the kitchen table. Look, look at these. This is what real dedication looks like. She just stared at them. When she asked me to come to parent teacher night, I said I couldn't. It was the anniversary of my wife's death. I needed to go to the cemetery. But, dad, it's only once a year and it's my junior year. It matters. Your mom matters, too. I went to the grave. Instead, sat there three hours talking to a headstone. My daughter ate microwave Mac and cheese alone. I thought I was keeping my wife's memory alive. I thought I was being a good husband. I didn't notice my daughter stopped showing me her report cards, stop telling me about swim practice, start, started eating every meal in her room. Then came her 18th birthday. I took her to this Italian place downtown, her favorite. She'd been asking to go for two months. We sat down. She ordered chicken Parmesan. I started talking before the waiter even left. Mom and I came here for our first anniversary. She ordered the same thing, same table. Actually, my daughter put her menu down. Dad, do you even know what place I got at regionals? I opened my mouth. Nothing came out. Third place, she said. Her voice was quiet. Out of 47 swimmers, I texted you the results. I called you four times. I left a note on the counter right next to your coffee mug. You were at the cemetery talking to someone who can't answer you instead of watching me.

She went to the hospital with a spinal injury and never walked again. I was on the other side of the playground when it happened. Everything changed after that. They started treating me like I had done something terrible. My parents stopped hugging me goodnight. They would ask my sister about her day at dinner. But when I tried to talk, they looked down at their plates. When I made honor roll in 5th grade, my dad glanced at the paper and walked away without saying anything. By middle school, things got worse. My sister started at my school and suddenly everyone knew our story. Teachers gave me sad looks. Kids would stop talking when I walked past, then whisper once I was down the hall. Then one day, someone said it to my face. They told me I was the reason my sister was in that wheelchair. I went home and asked my parents if it was true. My mom looked at me with this cold expression and said, you were playing too rough that day. You distracted her right before she fell. Everything clicked into place. At family gatherings, my aunts and uncles would lecture me about being more careful. My grandparents. Stopped acknowledging my birthday. Every Christmas, I watched my sister open piles of presents while I got two or three things. I asked my mom why once and she said she's been through enough because of you. High school was terrible. I had no friends and spent every lunch hiding in the library. At 16, I was having dark thoughts and begged my parents to let me see a therapist. My dad laughed in my face and said therapy was for victims, not for people who cause problems. The day I turned 18, I packed everything and left. I got a small apartment and work night shifts while going to community college. My parents paid for everything for my sister, college, car, apartment. When I asked why they wouldn't help me, my mom said, you know exactly why. I stopped going home. The few times I showed up for holidays, I sat at the far end of the table in silence while everyone else laughed. By 25, I had an accounting job and my own apartment. I started dating someone who cared about me, but the guilt was killing me. I couldn't sleep and would wake up sweating thinking about my sister in that wheelchair because of what I did. My girlfriend found me on the bathroom floor having a panic attack. She told me I needed help. I started seeing a therapist and after three sessions, she.

So I work nights at this diner and we get all kinds of weird situations, but this one takes the cake. It's like two in the morning on homecoming weekend and this couple walks in, probably mid thirties. Place is packed, which is unusual for us at that hour, but whatever. Football towns go crazy during homecoming. I go take their order and right away the husband tells me his wife is autistic and needs everything on separate plates because she won't eat food that touches other food. No problem. We can do that. Then she orders a kids meal. I have to tell them our policy says kids meals are only for kids under 12. Everything on the kids menu is available for adults, just costs like $1, 50 more total. The husband says fine and I punch it in. About 20 minutes later, the husband is waving me down, looking all stressed. He says his wife is having a panic attack and they need to pay for their drinks and leave right now. I tell him to give me one second so I can let the kitchen know to stop making their food. He nods. I go back to the kitchen and tell them to cancel the order. But the cook says it's already done, already plated. So I asked him to box it up to go instead. Takes maybe 30 Seconds, I walk back out with the news and tell them the food is ready. We're just boxing it up for them to take home. That's when the wife says she won't be able to eat it because of her panic attack. I get it. Panic attacks suck. But I tell her I'm sorry that happened, but the food was ordered and prepared, so they still need to pay. I offer to comp their drinks, though. She asks why she should pay for food she can't eat. I explain that once food is ordered and the kitchen makes it, the company requires payment. Even if someone stays at their table and doesn't touch their food, they still have to pay for what they ordered. That's just how restaurants work. She keeps insisting she had a panic attack and that I should have recognized it was a medical episode. I tell her straight up that I'm a server, not a doctor or a nurse. I don't have medical training. If paramedics were Wheeling her out on a stretcher, that would be different. But she's standing here talking to me clearly, I don't see how her condition means she doesn't have to pay her Bill. They paid, they left. I thought that was the end of it. Two days later, my manager calls me into the office. Apparently, they filed a corporate complaint saying I discriminated against them for making the wife pay for food she couldn't eat because of a Panic attack caused by her autism. My manager asked me what happened. So I told.

My roommate Ben was chill until I realized he'd steal my food and lie about it. Whenever I bought eggs, he'd use six to make high protein meals. I couldn't leave leftover food in the fridge or else it'd be gone in 10 minutes. Then he'd have the audacity to lie every time, brag about eating the food or even gaslighting us, saying we ate it in our sleep. We were sick of it. More and more food started to disappear. Every time I go to the grocery store, I would only end up with half. Before the day was out, food ghosted us. The package of noodles I bought to make my girlfriend spaghetti, gone. Ben, where's the noodles, I asked him. Olivia ate them. I knew better. Olivia hated spaghetti noodles. Olivia's food started to disappear, too. Ben, stop. Stop grabbing my chips, Olivia said when she caught him red handed. Ben just smirked. I thought you said I could. It pissed her off. It pissed me off. Hey, thanks for the sandwich, Henry. Ben grinned while eating the sub sandwich I just brought home for lunch. Not cool, man. Stop being a jerk. I'm angry. Every day. Something new. Yo, Olivia, great job on those brownies. Ben clapped her on the shoulder, getting brownie crumbs all over the kitchen floor. Henry, did you see where I put those sugar cookies? Olivia asked me. One more morning. No, I haven't touched them. They were awesome. Homemade, Ben asked, putting the plate that held them into the sink. Olivia looked like she wanted to punch him. She almost did. It got so bad we couldn't even eat at home. You're a pain, I told Ben in anger. I think you're too stressed, retarded. He truly didn't see the issue. So, Ben, when are you going to pay me for that grocery shopping trip I did yesterday, Olivia asked him. We never agreed to that. Ben just waves her off. I think you guys just forget you eat, Ben smirks. He's off, man. No way we're forgetting our own food, I say, annoyed. I'd get that checked out. I think you two have memory problems. He calls on the way out, Olivia and I just sit in fury. He's such a jerk. Olivia spits. I second that. We've got to do something, I mutter. We need to stage an intervention.

Every time she touched me, kissed me good night, I wanted to explode. But I kept my face neutral. When she asked why I seemed off, I blamed work stress. Day two, my brother and his wife came over. The second Ashley left for her shift, we packed like we were robbing the place. Clothes, electronics, important documents, my grandfather's watch. Everything that mattered to me. By three PM, I was complete. We moved out. I blocked her number, blocked her on everything. I told my parents what happened and sent them the proof. They were furious and fully supported me cutting her off. Ashley came home to an empty apartment that evening. From what I heard later, she lost it. Screaming, crying, calling everyone we knew, trying to find me. Then she made her move. She started telling people I cheated. That she discovered I was unfaithful and had to kick me out. That I abandoned her and refused to face what I'd done. My phone explode. Her parents called my parents demanding answers. Mutual friends were texting, asking how I could do this to her. Her sister left me a voicemail, calling me every name in the book. Even my own cousin texted, bro, what the hell? Ashley's devastated. She'd gotten ahead of the story, painted herself as the victim. And everyone believed her because why wouldn't they? We were perfect. I was the one who disappeared. For 24 hours, I let her think she'd won. Then I sat down at my brother's computer and opened my email. I pulled up every photo her friend sent me, every video of Ashley with her tongue down random guys'throats, the timestamp from the bathroom incident. I typed one sentence. Since Ashley has been sharing her version of events, here's the full story. Then I hit forward. I sent it to both sets of parents, her entire friend group, my friend group, her sisters, my cousins, every single person she'd lied to. I included her friends who knew and said nothing. For good measure, I forwarded it to her work email, not to get her fired, just so her office friends she'd been crying to would know the truth. Within an hour, my phone went completely silent. Hers started ringing off the hook. Her mom called, my mom, crying and apologizing. Her dad left me a voicemail saying he was disgusted with his daughter. Friends who'd been trashing me started texting apologies. Ashley tried calling from different numbers. I blocked every single one. The last message I saw before blocking her final attempt was, you destroyed my life. I typed back, no, I just forwarded your actions to everyone you lied to. Then I blocked that number, too.

I need a ride to soccer practice. I'd smile politely. Ask your dad. Or maybe call your real mom, since she's so wonderful. Week 3, my stepdaughter's big school project was due. She'd always left things to the last minute because I'd swoop in and help. Not anymore. She failed and came home crying. My husband tried to blame me. You could have reminded her. I shrugged. Real mom would have remembered. Then came the phone call that changed everything. It was a Thursday evening, one month into my strike. The doorbell rang, and my husband answered. I heard raised voices, shocked gasps, a woman's voice I didn't recognize, but the kids did. They came running down the stairs, screaming, mom! Mom! You came back! I walked into the living room and saw her, their real mom, standing in the doorway with a designer purse and fresh highlights. All smiles, like she hadn't abandoned her children for four years. My stepson was sobbing, wrapped around her waist. My stepdaughter was frozen, staring. My husband looked like he'd seen a ghost. She laughed, that practiced, melodious laugh. Surprise. I know it's been a while, but I'm back now. I've worked through my issues, and I'm ready to be the mother you deserve. My stepdaughter found her voice. You're staying You're really staying this time? Of course, sweetheart. The woman pulled her into a hug. I've missed you both so much. And I brought someone I want you to meet. A man stepped out from behind her. Tall, expensive suit, cold eyes. This is my husband. We got married last year in Bali. My husband's face went pale. The kids looked confused. Your husband? But you're still married to dad? He never signed any divorce papers. The woman's smile faltered. About that. I need to discuss some things with your father. Grown up things. Why don't you two go upstairs? I couldn't fit. What happens next in this short video.

I was flipping burgers at my summer barbecue when Missus Kowalski's cat literally threw itself through her closed kitchen window. Not near the window. Through the window. Glass exploded everywhere, and this orange tabby landed in her flower bed, screeching like it had seen the devil himself. Twenty of us just froze mid conversation and stared, because cats don't just kamikaze through windows for no reason. Then we heard a man inside Mrs. Kowalski's house scream, what the hell? Followed by the loudest crash I've ever heard. That wasn't a car accident. Mrs. Kowalski, who was standing right next to me holding a plate of potato salad, popped the entire thing on the ground and whispered, I live alone. That's when my roommate Gavin, who was already six beers deep and shirtless for some reason, grabbed the metal barbecue spatula, held it up like a sword, and yelled, who wants to be a hero? Before sprinting full speed toward her back door. Four other drunk guys immediately chased after him, screaming various battle cries. And I just stood there thinking this was either the dumbest or greatest thing I'd ever witnessed. But here's where it gets weird. As Gavin reached Missus Kowalski's back door, it flew open from the inside, and a guy in all black came running out carrying a pillowcase full of stuff. He was wearing a ski mask. In the middle, Of July. And didn't see Gavin until the last possible second. Collided at full speed, and the burglar's pillowcase exploded on impact, sending jewelry and electronics flying through the air in slow motion. A laptop hit the fence, ring scattered across the grass, and Gavin, who'd somehow held onto his spatula during the collision, just laid there on top of the burglar, yelling, I've captured him! I've actually captured him! The burglar tried to scramble away, but Derek tackled him from the side with a pool noodle, which shouldn't have worked, but absolutely did, because the burglar slipped on Missus Kowalski's wet grass and went down hard. My cousin Felix, who'd grabbed a bag of charcoal, for reasons nobody understood, just dumped the entire thing on the guy's head. The burglar was now covered in black dust, coughing, and blind. And that's when Julian appeared out of nowhere, holding a massive watermelon above his head, like the boulder from Indiana Jones. Time actually seemed to slow down as Julian wound up his throw. Everyone watching started yelling different things. Don't do it! Do it! That's evidence! Throw it! The burglar

So I mailed her a one dollar card that said, congrats on teaching me. Who's family? I blocked every number. Three days later, my mom called from the hospital asking why no one came to her surgery. I'm Iris, single mom, work from home doing medical billing. My daughter Rosie is 7 and had been rehearsing for the Three Little Pigs for two months straight. She was pig No. 2, 4 lines total.

I got there early and saved them. Front row seats, four chairs in. The center. I draped my jacket over one, Rosie's backpack over another, my purse across two. The auditorium filled up fast. Parents with camcorders, grandparents with flowers, siblings squirming in their seats. Six twenty five PM, I checked my phone, nothing. Six thirty PM, lights dimmed. I pulled my stuff off the seats. A mom with a toddler asked if they were taken. I hesitated then shook my head. She sat down. Rosie peeked through the curtain before the show started, scanning the crowd. I waved, gave her a big thumbs up. She didn't smile back, just ducked behind the curtain again. The play started. Rosie delivered her lines perfectly. I clapped so loud my hands stung, recorded every second on my phone. When she took her bow, I stood up and cheered alone. After the show, kids swarmed into the lobby. Families hugging, taking photos, handing out flowers. Rosie walked over to me holding her paper pig ears. Her eyes were scanning the crowd. Did they get lost? She asked quietly. I checked my phone. Group chat, silent since Tuesday. I opened Instagram, Lauren's story from two hours ago. Mimosas at a table by a window. Sunday, fun day with my people. Except it was Thursday. My mother was in the background laughing with a drink in her hand. Dylan's arm visible in the corner holding a beer. I knelt down and hugged Rosie. I don't know, baby. She nodded, didn't cry, just said, can we get ice cream?

But it is the other way around. So I went nuclear and emailed the proof to everyone. Ashley and I met freshman year of college. We were both 18 and went from study partners to inseparable in about three weeks. Everyone said we were relationship goals, the kind of couple that made people believe in soulmates. She was everything I wanted. Funny, smart, gorgeous. And she actually wanted to build a future together. Our families got so close that holidays felt like one big reunion. Before we were even married. I proposed a year ago. She said yes, obviously. But something shifted after that ring went on her finger. She started going out more. Girls nights, clubbing, drinking. Stuff she used to invite me to. But suddenly, I wasn't welcome anymore. Every weekend, without fail. I told myself it was cold feet, wedding stress. Totally normal. I should have trusted my gut. Last Tuesday, I got a text from one of her friends. I can't keep a secret anymore. I'm so sorry. She sent me pictures and videos that made my stomach drop. Ashley had been telling her friends she felt trapped, that she hadn't explored enough before settling down. So these girls nights, she was making out with random guys on the dance floor, grinding on them, testing the waters. And in one video, she's walking into a bathroom with some dude. Her friend confirmed what I already knew. What she did in that bathroom made everything clear. The friend said she doesn't think it counts as cheating since she's not sleeping with them. Here's what makes this a knife to the heart. When I was in high school, my ex cheat cheated on me. I was a stupid kid and tried to end everything. Ashley knew the story. She held me while I cried, telling her about it during our second date. She knew exactly what cheating would do to me. And she did it anyway. I sat in my car for an hour just staring at those pictures. Part of me wanted to crawl into bed and disappear for a month. But I couldn't afford to be weak right now. I called my brother, told him everything. He said, pack your shit. You're staying with us. Don't say a word to her yet. I took two days off work. Ashley and I split rent fifty fifty on our apartment. So everything was joint. I had to be smart about this. Day one, I moved non essentials while she was at work. When she got home, she noticed some stuff was gone. I told her I sold some things online and put the rest in a storage unit to clear space. She bought it completely. I was screwed.

She'd cry dramatically, take a few selfies looking sad, then leave because it was too hard for her.

I Knew what I had to do. The funeral was packed. Normani sat in the front row wearing a black veil like she was Jackie Kennedy. When it came time for family remarks, she actually got up to speak. Started talking about their beautiful love story and how dad was her soulmate. I couldn't take it anymore. I stood up right in the middle of her speech. Shut up, Normani! The whole church went silent. She tried to keep talking, but I walked up to the podium. You weren't his soulmate. You were his midlife crisis who couldn't even be bothered to show up while he was dying. I turned to everyone. This woman spent his last day shopping for her next husband on dating apps. I tried to change his will while he was on morphine. Normani's face went white. How dare you? You're not his widow. You're not our family. You're just someone who married a dying man for his money. And guess what? Dad changed his will three weeks ago. You get nothing! The lawyer stood up from the third row and nodded. Normani ran out sobbing. Real tears this time. I sat back down and finally let myself cry for dad.

What decisions? I promoted Marcus instead of Kyle partly because I believed Kyle was preparing to leave. David pulled out his notes. I called Kyle because HR flagged him as a flight risk due to being passed over for advancement repeatedly. I was assessing whether we were properly recognizing his contributions. And I gave his promotion to the person who sabotaged him, Jennifer realized. David turned to me. Kyle, would you have left if you've been promoted? No. This company is where I want to grow. What about now, after being passed over again? I don't know. It's hard to feel valued when someone can derail my career with rumors. David made a call to HR. I need Marcus Williams in Conference Room B immediately. Twenty minutes later, Marcus sat across from David, Jennifer, and me. Marcus, did you tell management that Kyle was job hunting? David asked. I heard him on a call with a recruiter. I thought Jennifer should know. That call was with me. I'm the CEO conducting retention assessments. Marcus's confident expression crumbled. I didn't know that. How was I supposed to know? You weren't supposed to know. That was the point of informal calls. But you weaponized private information to sabotage a colleague. I was looking out for the team. You were eliminating competition for a promotion you wanted. Jennifer added. Marcus, your promotion is rescinded, effective immediately. You can't do that. David stood up. We can and we are. You Deliberately undermined a colleague based on assumptions and gossip. That's not leadership behavior. Marcus was escorted out by HR within the hour. David offered me the senior analyst position that afternoon with a formal apology for the mishandling of the situation. What about Jennifer? She been counseled about making personnel decisions based on unverified information. I accepted the promotion. Jennifer and I worked through the awkwardness over the following weeks. Marcus tried contacting me once. You got me fired over a misunderstanding. You sabotage my promotion by spreading rumors about a call you knew nothing about. I was trying to help. You were trying to win. There's a difference. Six months later, I'm thriving in my new role. The CEO retention program continues, and I occasionally help conduct the informal assessments. Last week, someone mentioned Marcus on LinkedIn. Was listing his employment with our company as lasting three years longer than it actually did. Some people will do anything for a competitive advantage. And destroying colleagues with incomplete information. Marcus Learned that the recruiter call he weaponized against me was actually the CEO's test of employee loyalty. The irony is perfect. He tried proving I wasn't committed to the company by exposing a call that was specifically measuring my commitment. And in the process, he proved his own lack of integrity to the person who could actually affect his career.

I was flipping burgers at my summer barbecue when Missus Kowalski's cat literally threw itself through her closed kitchen window, not near the window, through the window. Glass exploded everywhere and this orange tabby landed in her flower bed screeching like it had seen the devil himself. 20 of us just froze mid conversation and stared because cats don't just kamikaze through windows for no reason. Then we heard a man inside Mrs. Kowalski's house scream, what the hell? Followed by the loudest crash I've ever heard. That wasn't a car accident. Mrs. Kowalski, who was standing right next to me holding a plate of potato salad, popped the entire thing on the ground and whispered, I live alone. That's when my roommate, Gavin, who was already six beers deep and shirtless for some reason, grabbed the metal barbecue spatula, held it up like a sword and yelled, who wants to be a hero? Before sprinting full speed toward her back door. Four other drunk guys immediately chased after him, screaming various battle cries. And I just stood there thinking this was either the dumbest or greatest thing I'd ever witnessed. But here's where it gets weird. As Gavin reached Missus Kowalski's back door, it flew open from the inside and a guy in all black came running out carrying a pillowcase full of stuff. He was wearing a ski mask in the middle. Of July and didn't see Gavin until the last possible second. Collided at full speed and the burglar's pillowcase exploded on impact, sending jewellery and electronics flying through the air in slow motion. A laptop hit the fence, rings scattered across the grass and Gavin, who'd somehow held onto his spatula during the collision, just laid there on top of the burglar yelling, I've captured him. I've actually captured him. The burglar tried to scramble away, but Derek tackled him from the side with a pool noodle, which shouldn't have worked, but absolutely did because the burglar slipped on Missus Kowalski's wet grass and went down hard. My cousin Felix, who'd grabbed a bag of charcoal for reasons nobody understood, stumped the entire thing on the guy's head. The burglar was now covered in black dust, coughing and blind. And that's when Julian appeared out of nowhere holding a massive watermelon above his head like the boulder from Indiana Jones. Time actually seemed to slow down as Julian wound up his throat. Everyone watching started yelling different things. Don't do it. Do it. That's evidence. Throw it. The burglar looked up through his charcoal covered ski mask just in time to see 20 pounds of watermelon flying directly at his face. The impact sounded like a cartoon sound effect. The watermelon exploded. The burglar went down and Julian just stood there with his arms raised in victory yelling, watermelon justice. The burglar wasn't knocked out, just absolutely covered in fruit. Chunks and charcoal dust.

In Dubai, I posted champagne served before take off. My ring visible airplane emoji. Day 2 I posted yacht skyline at night. Sometimes life has a way of settling scores. My brother commented, did you win the lottery? Be careful with debt. Day three pre wedding prep photos with champagne ring sparkling. I wrote marrying the richest man I know. In values, spirit and everything else too. My cousin commented, is this the same Carlos everyone thought sold chairs? They googled him, found Forbes articles. Carlos, the silent architect of luxury hospitality. Multi million dollar donations. The family chat went silent. Then they deleted their mocking comments. Day 4 sunset ceremony on yacht deck. White flowers, live violinist. The post us embracing with lights backdrop. Family is who chooses to be there for you. Panic began. My father texted, are you humiliating us? My parents friends commented publicly we went to his hotel opening in Qatar. Wonderful people. A week later, they showed up with expensive gifts, addressing only my husband. My husband let them talk, then spoke with Glacial Calm. A month ago, I was your sister's charity project, right? The only difference is now you know. My father has a bigger bank account. You measured your daughter's worth by the man she married. You told your own daughter her love was worthless for happiness and embarrassment. He walked to the door. You will leave now. Six months later, my brother was fired. My parents became social pariahs. We blocked them completely. I changed my last name, cutting the final tie. The real wealth was never money. It was the dignity I reclaimed. And learning that family is chosen, not inherited.

Starting salary, $75,000. I was making 60. Six thousand dollars a year. And I've been working five years. Year 5, everything shifted. Dad landed a big contract. Shopping complex. 800 thousand dollar job. But it required stamped engineering plans. We had to subcontract the design work. The engineer who showed up was 26, my age. She had a tablet with 3D models. Pointed out three structural issues in Dad's original plan that would have failed inspection. Dad paid her $15,000 for two weeks of work. I made $15,000 in three months. That night, dad asked me to come over. Mom was already in bed. He poured two beers. You ever think about going back to school? He asked. I stared at him. What college? Engineering school. Whatever you wanted to do. You told me it was a waste. Dad was quiet for a long time. I was wrong. I see these young guys coming in with degrees, getting hired as project managers right out of school, making what I pay you. And they're just starting. So the $50,000 was for nothing? It wasn't for nothing. You Learned the trade. You know construction inside and out. But Cole. He looked tired. Suddenly old. You hit a ceiling without that degree. I hit it at 40, hit it at 30. Why didn't you tell me this five years ago? Because I was scared of losing you to some office job. Thought if I got you invested in the company early, You'd stay. He took a drink. That was selfish. I drove home at midnight, did the math in my head. If I went back now, I'd graduate at 35 years behind. I'll have to work to pay for it, since the $50,000 was long gone. Truck payments, apartment life. My buddy Marcus texted me the next day. Photo of his new house. Three bedrooms, just closed. I was still renting. I looked at college applications that night. Then I looked at my bank account. Then I closed the laptop. Six months later, I'm still framing houses. I'm making $32 an hour. Dad's talking about retirement, wants me to take over the business. But I've been watching YouTube videos on structural engineering, taking free online courses at night, saving every extra dollar. Maybe it's not too late. Maybe. The most expensive thing dad ever bought me was five years I can't get back. But I'm not buying into someone else's ceiling anymore. Even if it's my father's. Turns out the worst investment isn't the money you spend. It's the potential you trade for someone else's limited vision of your future.

When I finished with a dramatic flourish, the church lady slowly started clapping. Then another joined in. Then all five of them erupted in thunderous applause like I had just performed at Carnegie Hall. Young man, the head church lady said with actual tears streaming down her weathered face. That was the most beautiful, soul stirring thing I've ever heard in my entire life. Derek, you absolutely must marry this talented boy before someone else snatches him up. Derek's mom immediately started planning our entire wedding on the spot, pulling out her phone to call venues and florists while I stood there still frozen in my final dramatic pose. But the situation got infinitely worse from there. The church ladies loved my performance so much that they invited me to sing at their Sunday morning service. They wanted me performing how great Thou Art with full choreography and backup dancers. One was already texting her granddaughter about hiring me for her Sweet 16 party. Derek was full on panicking at this point. His mom was already picking out flower arrangements and discussing catering menu options. One church lady was asking about my ring size and whether I preferred gold or silver wedding bands. Then Derek's little sister walked in from soccer practice. One look at the complete chaos unfolding in their living room and announced loudly to everyone, Mom, Derek literally paid him $50 to pretend to be His boyfriend. I heard them planning this whole ridiculous scheme in the garage this morning. The silence that followed was absolutely deafening. Derek's mom slowly turned to stare at him with the fury of a thousand burning suns. The church ladies all stared at me in complete shock and Wilderment. I was still holding my jazz hands from the performance finale. Finally, after what felt like hours, the head church lady cleared her throat and said with perfect composure, well, Derek, at least we know you have absolutely excellent taste and entertainment. She turned to me. With a business like express, are you available for my granddaughter's wedding reception next month? We'll pay triple what Derek gave you. Derek still owes me another hundred dollars because I ended up singing at four more church events that month, including a funeral where I performed Amazing Grace with interpretive dance. His mom still asks me when we're setting our wedding date.

Send me a list. I'll have my lawyer review it. Days later, her brother Julian showed up at my office. You've got her engagement ring. Mom wants it back today. The ring was conditional upon marriage. Condition is no longer being met. That ring's worth more than your car. We can make this unpleasant. Are you threatening me? I asked calmly, phone recording in plain sight. Give back the ring, give Isabel her furniture half and apologize publicly. No, the ring's in secure storage. She can have furniture if she pays moving costs. And I won't apologize for being dumped by a text. That evening, I drove to storage with a sickening feeling. My grandfather's desk had a secret compartment. I'd shown Isabel once I opened it and my grandfather's watch, gone. She'd stolen it before I'd even started packing. The one thing truly irreplaceable to me. They'd mistaken my calm for weakness. Fine, they get a war fought with receipts and documentation. I filed small claims for the stolen watch, camera, laptop and Isabel's share of final rent. Court day arrived. I wore a simple suit with one organized folder. They arrived as a phalanx, Marcus, Eleanor, Isabel and Julian. I presented simply, here's the list, bills, receipts, photo of me wearing my grandfather's watch and the text that started it all. I read it aloud. I'm not marrying a broke man. Either upgrade or I'm gone. Marcus argued the items were gifts. Text was hyperbolically I was vindictive. The judge looked at Isabel. Did you take the watch from the desk? Her eyes flickered to her mother. It was a gift. Is that true, sir? No, your honor. It was my grandfather's. Priceless to me. She ruled in my favor on all counts. They were ordered to return everything and pay the watches value plus outstanding rent. Julian had to physically restrain Marcus from yelling at the judge. A week later, a courier delivered the camera, laptop and a check. No note. I sold the ring and used it as down payment on a condo, a real upgrade. Months later, Isabel texted at 2 a. M. Heard you bought a condo. Guess my little push worked. You should thank me. I deleted it without replying.

I overheard you on a call with a recruiter last week. Just thought you should know. People are talking. My stomach dropped. What people? I mentioned it to a few team members. I'm wondering if you're really committed to the promotion, if you're already looking elsewhere. Marcus, that was a personal call in the office during work hours.

Call had been with someone named David Chen who'd ask questions about my career goals and satisfaction at the company. I thought it was a recruiter. I spoke with someone about career development, but I'm not actively job hunting. Kyle, I need to know you're committed. This promotion requires someone planning to stay long term.

Marcus told you I was talking to recruiters, but it was actually our CEO. First face went pale. Our CEO called you directly. The meeting with David was scheduled for that afternoon. Jennifer attended. Looking nervous. David got straight to the point. Kyle, I've been conducting informal retention interviews with high potential employees. You're one of 12 people I contacted. Marcus told management I was job hunting because of your call. David's expression hardened. He what? Jennifer jumped in. I may have made decision.

My professor drops the bomb three weeks before finals that the group project is worth 70% of our grade and we get to pick our own teams. Three best friends since freshman year immediately swarm me, like, obviously we're together, right? And honestly, I'm pumped because we always crush projects together. Professor hands us this massive case study about restructuring a failing tech company and says it needs a 30 page analysis plus a 20 minute presentation. I'm already mentally dividing the work when my friend goes, you're so good at this stuff, you should take the lead. And the other two are nodding like bobbleheads. I figure, okay, I'll coordinate everything, assign sections based on everyone's strengths, set up our Google Drive. You know, actual leader stuff. We make this whole show about being the dream team, and the professor even smiles at us saying, this should be interesting. The assignment packet is thick as a book, and I'm already highlighting key sections. That night, I create a group chat and mention our first meeting tomorrow at the library. Everyone confirms first meeting. Nobody shows up. I sit there for two hours with my color coded notes and structured timeline. While they're posting Instagram stories from some party. I text the group, where are you guys? And get back, sorry, emergency came up. You got this, though. Next day in class, they're literally sitting three rows behind Me whispering and laughing, and when I turn around, they wave like nothing happened. Second meeting attempt. One friend shows up 45 minutes late just to tell me she has to leave for her boyfriend's thing, but email me what I need to do. I created this detailed spreadsheet with everyone's parts, deadlines, research sources, and I get crickets. We two. I head over to eat lunch with them, and over here, why is he being such a try hard about this project? It's not that deep. And another goes, classic bookworm behavior. I confront them after class, like, are you guys going to help on the final or not? And they're suddenly all concerned and serious faces. Of course we're working on it. Stop stressing. But then I see them at the professor's office hours without me. Later, the professor even pulls me aside and says, your teammates mentioned you haven't been responding to their attempts to elaborate. That doesn't sound like you. My stomach drops. I show him my phone, the ignored messages, the empty shared documents, and he just nods, but says, try to work it out. Group dynamics are part of the grade. A week before the presentation, I check our shared drive. One person uploaded a single paragraph that's literally copy and pasted from Wikipedia. Yeah. I text desperately. Presentation is Monday, we have nothing. And the only response is, relax, we'll figure it out Sunday night. I didn't trust it, so I got to Work on my own. Sunday night, eleven PM. I'm putting final touches on the presentation I built alone, when I get an email notification. It's from the professor. Sent to the whole group by accident. Clearly meant just for my three friends. Subject line RE concerns about team member. I open it and my blood runs cold. There's a whole email chain. My friends had been meeting with the professor for weeks, building a case.

But I need someone I can trust on job sites now. The check sat between us $50,000. My tuition deposit was $500. I'd already sent it. What if I want to do both? Work summers, go to school during. This is an either or offer, Cole. You want the money, you commit full time. No college. I looked at mom. She was gripping the edge of the sink. Take the night to think about it, dad said. But I need an answer by morning. Got three projects starting Monday. I didn't sleep. Just stared at that check on my nightstand. In the morning, I took the money. The first year was good. I Learned framing, electrical, plumbing. Dad paid me $22 an hour, which felt like a fortune. I bought a truck, got my own apartment. My high school friends came home for Christmas break with stories about meal plans and freshman seminars. I showed them my new F1 50. Year 2, dad made me a site supervisor. $28 an hour. More responsibility, longer hours. I was good at it, really good. The crew respected me because I worked as hard as they did. Year 3, I started noticing things. Dad's bids were getting rejected. We lost a commercial project to a firm that used computer modeling. That did. The owner kept mentioning his son. The one with the civil engineering degree. That's just fancy drawings, dad said. We build with our hands. But the jobs kept going to the guys with the fancy drawings. Year 4, Dad had a health scare. Nothing serious, but enough to slow him down. He started talking about me taking over sooner than planned. You'll run this whole operation by the time you're 30, he said. Better than any degree. I was making $32 an hour. By then, I'd saved $40,000. I had a girlfriend, a routine, a life. But I kept thinking about my friend Marcus. He graduated last spring. Kept

My dad's new wife, Normani, is 28. I'm 32. Mom died exactly one year ago. And dad met Normani on some cruise to Mexico like four months later. She calls me sweetie at family dinners like she's some wise elder who's been around forever. She moved into our childhood home three months after meeting him. Dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in August. The doctor said six months, maybe eight if we were lucky. Dad took it like he took everything else quietly with a small nod like he was accepting a dinner reservation. Normani's first response was asking if we should still go ahead with our anniversary trip to Pablo. I'm not even joking. The man just found out he's dying and she's worried about her tan lines. She actually pulled up the resort website on her phone while we were still in the oncologist's office. First chemo session. She showed up 45 minutes because she had a nail appointment she couldn't reschedule. My sister and I had been there since 6 in the morning. Normani walked in with her fresh acrylics. One look at dad throwing up into a bucket and said she needed some air. She spent the rest of the session in the hospital cafeteria facetiming her friends. By October, Dad couldn't walk without help. Normani hired a nurse, which sounds nice until you realize she did it so she wouldn't have To touch him. She literally told me, I can't handle all the gross stuff. That's not what I signed up for. Meanwhile, she was still posting Instagram stories from her morning yoga classes and wine nights with the girls. November was when things got really bad. Dad needed around the clock care. We set up a schedule. My siblings and I would rotate nights. Normani said she'd take Mondays and Thursdays. First Monday, she called me at midnight saying she had a migraine and could I cover Thursday. Her friend was having a crisis the next Monday, food poisoning. After 3 weeks of this, we stopped putting her on the schedule. Then came the money stuff. While dad was literally on his deathbed, barely conscious, Normani was in his office going through financial documents. She called his lawyer twice asking about the will. She tried to get power of attorney when the lawyer told her that went to me as the oldest child.

By week one, the apartment was approaching biohazard status. The sink was completely full. Fruit flies had established a small civilization. The trash was overflowing onto the floor. Morgan left passive aggressive notes. Some of us have jobs and can't clean 24 7, I added a note below hers. Me too. That's why I only clean my stuff now. Week two, Morgan tried guilt tripping me in front of her boyfriend. I used to think we were friends, but he won't even help around the apartment anymore. I looked up from my spotless dishes. You called me your personal maid, remember? In front of 15 people. Her boyfriend's face changed. You said what? Week three, the landlord did a surprise inspection. I'd gotten a tip he was coming. I deep cleaned my room and my personal items, then went to stay at my girlfriend's place for two days. When I came back, there was a violation notice on the door. Excessive mess and unsanitary conditions. They had 15 days to fix it or face eviction. Jake was furious. This is your fault. You could have warned us. I was out of town. Besides, I'm not your maid. Remember? They tried cleaning. They really did. But they never actually scrubbed a toilet or degreased a stove in their lives. They bought the wrong products. They didn't know you had to move the furniture to vacuum under it. Morgan had a breakdown trying to figure out how to clean The shower. This is impossible. How did you do all this? Practice? I said years of not being a slob. Week 4, they failed the reinspection. The landlord gave them 30 days to vacate. They both blamed me constantly. You ruined our lives over a joke. But their parents, who had to help them move, think it was funny. Morgan's mom took one look at the apartment and said, you're 26 years old. How do you not know how to clean? Jake's dad was even harsher. We didn't raise you to treat people like servants. Last week, they moved out. The landlord asked if I wanted to stay with new roommates. The apartment's yours if you want it. I'm increasing rent by $200. But you've earned it for keeping your space clean. I stayed. Got two new roommates who interview next week. First question on my list, when you say you'll clean later, define later.

I'm immediately panicking because someone definitely died, right? I open Instagram and there it is. I've been tagged in a YouTube video, 15 minutes long. The thumbnail is this guy I knew from high school crying into the camera. I haven't spoken to this guy in over a decade. We weren't friends. We weren't enemies. We just existed in the same building for four years. The comments are hundreds of people calling him brave and inspiring. My phone buzzes. My mom's crying, honey, why didn't you tell me it was that bad? My best friend texts, just watch the whole thing. Are you okay? It isn't until I'm at work and my coworkers give me sad looks that I locked myself in the bathroom and finally watch the video. The guy is sobbing on camera, describing the most horrific bullying campaign I've ever heard. He mentions destroying my science project the day before the fair and I failed the class. He mentions spreading a rumor that I had AIDS that got me suspended for 2 weeks. He describes locking me in the equipment closet for hours, except none of this happened. The video is Spreading rapidly across mental health communities. I try to comment. Hi, this is me. These things didn't actually happen. I immediately get attacked. Stop trying to make his healing about you. This is why men don't open up. HR. Calls me in. They claim the video is causing workplace disruption. They suggest I take personal time. I text him, none of this happened. Take it down. He responds, I'm sharing my truth. You're free to share yours. So I make my own video explaining these events never occurred. I get 20 views. The comments are brutal. Narcissist. You're denying someone's trauma. My family starts questioning me. Even my dad says, maybe you don't remember it the same way. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I contact a lawyer who basically laughs at me. She says he can claim my perception versus factual events. Defamation is nearly impossible to prove. Cool. Love that for me.

While she definitely provided evidence, called me unqualified, said I need constant handholding, and suggested I look for entry level work elsewhere. Entry level work, David repeated. She told the CEO to look for entry level work. I reviewed my notes from the interview. She made assumptions about qualifications based entirely on school prestige and company name recognition. Never asked about actual skills, projects, or results. Rachel scheduled a feedback meeting for the next day. Jennifer walked in confidently, expecting to discuss why she'd rejected another candidate. Jennifer, we need to discuss yesterday's interview. Rachel began. The candidate was clearly unqualified. Wrong background, mediocre credentials. I saved us from a bad hire. That candidate was Michael Torres, Jill said. Jennifer looked confused. Okay, that proves my point. His resume showed nothing impressive. Michael Torres, our founder and CEO, David clarified. The color drained from Jennifer's face. That's impossible. The CEO wouldn't interview for an internship. I was conducting anonymous assessments of our interview process. I explained HR flagged concerns about your candidate rejections. You tricked me. I attended a standard interview. You spent 30 minutes explaining why I wasn't qualified to work at the company I built. Jennifer tried recovering. I was maintaining our standards. We need the best talent. You rejected me based on school name and company recognition without asking about actual abilities or accomplishments. Your resume didn't show. My resume showed exactly what every candidate shows. Education, experience, skills. You dismissed it. Without investigation, Rachel placed a folder on the table. Jennifer, you've rejected 15 qualified candidates in three months. Several have since joined competitors where they're excelling. I was protecting our culture. You were blocking talent based on superficial criteria. David said. The CEO's Alma mater apparently wasn't good enough for you. Jen first voice shook. What happens now? You're being moved to an individual contributor role. Rachel said, no more hiring authority, no more team management. This is because of one interview? This is because of 15 rejected candidates, multiple HR complaints, and telling the company founder he should look for entry level work elsewhere. Jennifer left without another word, hired three of her rejected candidates the following month. All three are now top performers. One of them graduated from my Alma mater. Another worked at the same no name startups I did. The third had an average GPA from a state school.

In court, my seven year old asked the judge, can I show you something daddy doesn't know? The judge nodded. She held up her tablet, pressed play. I'm Matt, 35, architect, divorced. I design schools during the day and build pillow forts with my seven year old daughter Nora at night. She's the kind of kid who takes cereal boxes into castles. We. I've been living in the carriage house behind my parents place ever since Nora had a medical emergency that nearly wiped us out financially. It wasn't charity. I got it. That place, new floors, wiring, egress windows. I paid for everything. I paid rent, I paid utilities. I even paid their property taxes twice. And then there's Ava, my little sister, 30, works in event marketing. The family's golden retriever in human form. She shows up late, cries, cute and always gets what she wants. When she walks into a room, my parents tilt the whole house toward her. And what she wanted was my house. It started with wine at Sunday dinner. She twirled her glass and goes, it's kind of perfect back there, like a starter home. I laughed. For who? She goes for me, obviously. I looked around. My mom was still plating asparagus like it was a cooking show. My dad kept cutting chicken like his fingers weren't numb. Nobody looked at me. I gave Nora both drumsticks because I suddenly didn't want anything. Nobody said it out loud that night, but I could feel it shift. My sister had decided she wanted it and they were already helping her get it. Next week, my mom asked to meet at a cafe. She shows up with a folder. Of course, we've been talking, she says, about what Ava's ready to buy. We think it's time to make the carriage house official. I blinked. Official. How? She wants to own it. She wants the house I live in. She's been saving. It's not for sale. She needs to build equity. I'm still raising your granddaughter in there. Mom slides the folder to me like she's handing over a spreadsheet. Inside, comps, catch of the lot line and a draft lease termination. It gave me 90 days to get out, 90 days so Ava can start her journey. I said no, they sued me. I stood on my porch holding the certified letter while Nora leaned on my leg asking, why do you look mad? I'm just thinking. I said, because how do you explain to a seven year old that grandma and grandpa are evicting her so her aunt can post housewarming pics on Instagram? I pulled out everything. Rent receipts, emails, bank transfers labeled carriage house, heat and taxes. The email from mom saying, thanks for handling the property stuff this year. Every time they pretended it wasn't a real rental, I had proof it was. And Ava, she Kept showing up, hovering in my doorway like a real estate agent. I'd paint this wall, she said once, like I was already gone. Court day came. Ava wore white like she was accept in a diploma. My parents sat beside her like she was their emotional support animal. Their lawyer stood up, started in with permissive use, license revocation, reasonable expectation of ownership. He kept saying first home like it was a holy calling. I stood and said, I paid for everything. I remodeled it with permission. I paid rent. I paid taxes. This isn't generosity. This is theft. Dressed up as family, the judge raised a brow. Do you have documentation? I slid over the folder, every word. Ava stood up blinking hard. I'm not trying to steal anything. I've worked really hard. I deserve a home. You do, I said, just not mine. Then it happened. Nora stood up. She tugged her mom's sleeve and said, I want to show the judge something. Just my ex froze. Nora, I said, now is not the time. The judge looked over. She may.

Now I can leave him and take my share. She kissed me, made my coffee, acted like the perfect wife. That same morning, while she celebrated my promotion, my lawyer submitted the divorce paperwork. My filing included evidence of her hidden bank transfers, proving she was hoarding marital assets, financial misconduct claims, a request for asset Protection that would legally block her from touching my accounts. Because I filed first, I controlled the narrative. Two weeks later, Blake received the papers. She came home furious. You're divorcing me without even talking to me. I stayed completely calm. I just thought it was time. She tried everything, crying, screaming, threatening to take half. I stayed silent through all of it. When we got to court, Blake showed up dressed to impress, probably thinking she could talk her way out of it. Her lawyer opened confidently. My client is entitled to half of all shared marital assets. He's made sacrifices and deserves her fair share. Then my lawyer stood up. We have documented proof that Blake systematically transferred joint funds into a secret personal account. She withdrew large amounts under false pretenses, showing clear financial misconduct. The judge asked Blake to explain The transactions she froze. Her lawyer started scrambling. Then came the final move. My lawyer presented a financial forensic report showing Blake had been siphoning money while making me pay the majority of our living expenses. The judge frowned. This is Blake. This changes the nature of your claim. Instead of receiving 50% of assets, you may actually owe your husband restitution. I watched Blake's confident smirk disappear in real time. By the end, Blake lost all rights to my money. She was ordered to return a portion of the hidden funds and pay her own legal fees. I walked out with all my assets protected. As I walked past her, she hissed, you did this on purpose. I gave her a calm smile. I thought I was too dumb for that, Blake.

He continued, if you're finishing your projects before the allocated time, you're obviously cutting corners. Quality work takes time. I raised my hand to argue that efficiency meant we could take on more clients, but he cut me off with a sharp gesture. The time I've allocated for each task is perfect. 40 hours for a marketing proposal, 20 for a client report, 60 for a website redesign. These aren't suggestions, they're requirements. When I pointed out that I've been completing proposals in 20 hours with zero client complaints and five star reviews, he actually laughed. That's impossible without cutting corners. From now on, anyone completing work before their allocated hours will be written up for poor quality, regardless of what the client thinks. New policy was printed, laminated, and posted on every wall. It sucked, but I figured if I just went along with it, Callahan would eventually realize this was dumb. That's when I accidentally looked at Milo's cubicle, and I had to do a double take. Milo was leaning back in his chair, feet up on his desk, scrolling through his phone with AirPods in. What are you doing? I whispered, worried Milo was about to get trouble. He Just grinned and showed me his computer screen. A completed financial report sitting in his drafts, time stamp showing he'd finished it three hours ago. I'm running the clock, he said casually. The report took me five hours, but Callahan said it should take 20. So here I am ensuring quality for another 15 hours. I stared at him in disbelief. You're just going to sit here? Milo nodded toward Callahan's office. Earlier this morning, I actually submitted something a day after it was due. Callahan praised me in front of everyone for being thorough and detail oriented. I was stunned. I glanced towards Nora, and to my surprise, she was doing the exact same thing. She had her laptop open to a complete, completed presentation while watching Netflix on her phone. 13 more hours to go, she whispered when she caught me looking. Even Colby had already set up what looked like a leisure station at his desk. Coffee, snacks, book, and his Nintendo Switch. The pattern was everywhere I looked. The entire office had transformed into a waiting room. The most surreal moment came that afternoon when Callahan walked through, saw everyone at their desks doing nothing, and actually smiled. Now this is what I'd like to see. Excuse me, what? He stopped right next to Milo, who was actually just watching YouTube, and patted him on the shoulder before walking back to his office.

They airlifted him for emergency brain surgery. I need you. We packed through tears, begged airlines for emergency seats, watched $8,000 in non refundable honeymoon bookings vanish. We'd save for two years for this trip. On the flight, Sierra ghosted me. No text, no calls. When we landed, I called Children's Hospital. No pediatric trauma patients by that name.

No. Why would I be hurt? I can take care of myself. I called Sierra from her landline. California girls blared in the background. Hey, what's up? She slurred. You told me Eli was in surgery. She cackled. I knew if I lied, you would come back. You were being super Extra about your honeymoon. Must be nice having money while single moms struggle behind me.

This wasn't the first time. I called child services immediately. The social worker came the next day, interviewed Eli, photographed the empty fridge and mess. She warned me the system favors keeping families together. Two days later, Sierra showed at our door. Hair greasy, reeking of alcohol. She demanded Eli back. I told her no.

He's standing close to me because he trusts me. You're scaring him. So how about you back off? No, she insists he's scared because of you. He just doesn't know how to express it yet. Then she looks down at Ryan, her voice suddenly sweet. Come on now, sweetie. I'm here to rescue you. Come with me. Ryan presses harder against my leg. No, that's my daddy! I thought that would end it. It didn't. She reaches down, grabs Ryan by the arm, and starts running toward the exit. Ryan starts screaming. Loud, terrified screams. Daddy! Daddy! For two seconds, I'm frozen. I genuinely cannot process what's actually happening. This woman just grabbed my son and is running through the store with him. Then reality snaps back. I take off running, yelling at the top of my lungs. Stop! Stop her! She's kidnapping my son! Someone stop her! People turn and stare, but most just freeze. One worker near the front finally processes what's happening and steps in front of her before she reaches the automatic doors. Ma'am, stop! He says, holding up his hands. Why are you stopping me? She demands, still holding Ryan's arm. This man is trying to kidnap this child! Ryan is sobbing now, reaching for me. I grab him and pull him into my arms. You're okay, buddy. I've got you. The store manager appears, along with two other employees. We've called the police. The Manager says everyone needs to stay calm. The lady is indignant. He's kidnapping this boy. Look at them. He's white. And that man is clearly not his father. I'm his father, I say, my voice shaking. And you just tried to abduct my son. The police arrived six minutes later. She kept insisting she was saving him, that it was obvious I wasn't his father. I showed them my ID, pulled up my phone. Photos of Ryan's fourth birthday party, his first day of preschool, videos of him calling me daddy, a text thread with my wife from that morning confirming the grocery list. Her face went from righteous to pale in about 10 seconds. The officer asked if I wanted to press charges. Absolutely, I said. She was arrested for attempted kidnapping. Ryan's fine now. Shaken up, but fine. My wife was horrified when I told her, but I pressed charges, and I don't regret it for a second.

A girl came up to me and asked, will you be my daddy for 24 hours? I literally spit out my sprite. I wanted to scream at this girl that you can't just say those words to someone, especially not in a college cafeteria. I wanted to clear up the misunderstanding, so I said out loud, ha ha! It's a joke, everyone. Well, her name is Mackenzie, and she wasn't joking. Just staring at me with these intense green eyes, sliding a crisp 100 dollar Bill across the table. I know you're only, like, 26, she said, but you have that premature gray thing happening, and you dress like someone's dad. I looked down at my polo shirt, silently agreeing with her. She explained that this guy John from her chemistry class had been following her around campus for three weeks, showing up at her dorm, her classes, even her late night study spots. Campus security says he's not doing anything illegal, she said, tearing her napkin into tiny pieces. But yesterday he told me he knows my schedule better than I do. It's sounded like a threat, so I need to do something before he goes too far. The plan was simple but insane. I'd pretend to be her overprotective father visiting from out of town. Ex military, raised her alone after mom died, now working in private security. She coached me on what to say. Call Me, princess or sweetheart, she instructed, but say it like you'd murder anyone who hurt me. She even made me practice my dad voice in the empty stairwell. She also gave me a crash course in intimidation basics. Crack your knuckles when you see him, she said, counting on her fingers. Mention Afghanistan casually. And whatever you do, don't break character first. The whole thing felt like preparing for the world's strangest improv show. The confrontation happened that same afternoon. We were walking across the quad, me carrying her books like a to father, when John appeared from behind the library. Not walking, stalking. His eyes locked on Mackenzie like prey. There you are, he said, like he owned her. I felt Mackenzie's whole body go rigid, her fingers digging into my arm hard enough to hurt. Princess, I said louder than necessary, stepping in front of her. This the boy you meant

I pretended to get arrested to see who would bail me out. Three months ago. I got the idea after watching my cousin get locked up for a bar fight, and his parents had him out in under an hour. Meanwhile, I've been the family A T M. For years, covering my sister's car payment four months straight, putting down 12,000 for my brother's condo, and lending my uncle eight grand for his landscaping business. So when I needed help moving last September from a third floor walk up, nobody could make it. My sister had brunch, my brother had work, my uncle's back hurt, so I started planning my revenge. I called my buddy who works at the precinct, and he agreed to stage a fake arrest at our family barbecue Last Sunday. He showed up in uniform with a patrol car, read me my rights in front of everyone, and cuffed me next to the grill where my dad was cooking burgers. Charge with destruction of property at a local business, and bail was set at $5,000, which I'd casually mentioned the week before at dinner that I had sitting in my savings account from my work bonus. My sister was the first person to react. She pulled out her phone immediately and started recording vertical video for social media. This is going straight to TikTok, she said, actually laughing out loud like it was the Funniest thing she'd ever witnessed. My brother walked inside the house to grab another beer from the fridge. Absolutely nothing was happening. Didn't even bother to ask what I supposedly destroyed or if I was okay. My uncle, the exact one whose entire landscaping business I funded with my own money, said, well, you shouldn't have broken the law, buddy, and casually flipped his burger on the grill. My mom was more worried about what the neighbours would think. She told me I'd embarrass the whole family in front of everyone on the street. My dad said, this is exactly what happens when you don't think before acting. He refused to even look at me. Just kept grilling like I wasn't being arrested 10 feet away from him. Then about five minutes later, my girlfriend pulled up in her car. She wasn't even invited to the barbecue. Someone from my family had texted her about what was happening. And she drove straight over, still wearing her work scrubs from her hospital shift. She came running up to the patrol car with this panicked look on her face, asking if I was okay. What happened? Are you hurt? How much is the

My uncle muttered, you were never close anyway. I smiled and said, noted. When the pastor asked, who'd like to speak, I walked to the podium and read the letter she left me, addressed only to me. My grandmother raised me after my parents died when I was six. Fed me, clothed me, paid for college. My brother Garrett lived three blocks away, but visited twice a year. My uncle Mitchell lived in the same town, never called. The funeral was packed. Neighbors, church, friends for book club. I sat in the front row, alone. Garrett arrived late with his wife, Paige. They sat three rows back. No one hugged me. No one asked if I needed anything. He opened the floor. Would anyone like to share memories? Silence. Garrett checked his phone. Uncle Mitchell stared at the ceiling. Aunt Diane whispered something to Paige. I stood and walked to the podium, pulled out the envelope, cream colored. My name in her shaky handwriting across the front. I'd opened it the night before, alone in her kitchen. My grandmother left me this letter. I'd like to read it. Garrett's head snapped up. I unfolded the paper to my granddaughter, Ramona, the only one who showed up. The room went still. Ramona drove me to every chemo appointment. 63 trips over two years. He held my hand when the nausea got bad. She cleaned my house. When I couldn't stand. She never missed a Tuesday. I glanced up. Garrett's face was red. Page had stopped whispering. Garrett promised to visit last Christmas. I made his favorite pie. He texted me at 9 p m. To say he was going to Aspen instead. His wife wanted fresh powder. Gasps rippled through the crowd. Paige grabbed Garrett's arm. Mitchell called me twice this year. Once to ask if I was planning to sell the house soon. Once to remind me he'd always wanted the grandfather clock. Uncle Mitchell stood. This is inappropriate. Sit down, someone from the book club said sharply. I kept reading. I'm leaving my house to Ramona. The house at 447 Elmwood. The one Garrett and Mitchell have been asking about. The one they assumed would be split between them. You can't just. Already done, I said calmly. Transferred and notarized last month. Grandma made sure of it. I pulled the deed from my purse, held it up. This is a copy. The original is with my attorney. That includes furniture, jewelry, photo albums. Nothing. Uncle Mitchell's voice cracked. You manipulated her. I pulled out my phone, opened the group text from eight months ago. Turn the screen toward the crowd. This is from Garrett, January 14th. Quote. Not coming too far. You handle it, Ramona. We're doing a cruise. The room was silent except

I was at my brother's place watching the Bears game when my phone buzzed. Angela's name flashed on the screen. Weird timing. She knew I always watch Sunday football with Kevin. Hey, babe, what's up? Her voice was different, cold but excited, like she'd been practicing this conversation in the mirror. Don't baby me anymore. I'm calling to tell you it's over. Victor and I are together there now, and we're selling the food truck. Victor? Our so called investor who'd been helping us expand for the past six months. The guy who always found excuses to stop by when I wasn't there, bringing Angela coffee and business advice. What do you mean selling? I asked, feeling my stomach drop. Already sold, she said, and I could hear the smile in her voice. Cash buyer picked it up this morning. Paid full asking price, no questions asked. Victor knows people in the industry. My brother Kevin looked up from his beer, eyebrows raised, put the phone on speaker so he could hear this train wreck. We're taking the money and opening a real restaurant in Miami. Angela continued. Victor says food trucks are for amateurs. We're going big time now. I heard Victor laughing in the background, probably drunk on expensive wine. Tell him thanks for the recipe book, bro. Those tamale recipes are gonna make Us rich down in South Beach. My recipe book. 15 Years of perfecting my Late Grandmother's Secret Recipes. The Ones that made our truck the most popular spot at every festival in Chicago. Lines around the block at Grand Park sold out by 2 p m. Every Saturday. You can't just take my recipes, I said, trying to stay calm while my world collapsed. Actually, we can, Victor chimed in, clearly enjoying himself. Business partnership means shared assets, Buddy. Angela's got copies of everything. Every ingredient, every technique. Don't worry about us, Angela added with fake sweetness. We'll send you a postcard from our grand opening. Maybe you can get a job with one of those corporate food chains. I hear Taco Bell is always hiring. They both burst out laughing before the line went dead. Kevin stared at me, beer frozen halfway to his mouth. Dude, I'm so sorry. That's beyond messed up. Your grandmother's recipes? I sat there for a moment, processing what just happened. Then I started laughing. Really laughing. Bro, are you having a breakdown? Kevin asked, looking genuinely concerned. Should I call someone? Actually, I said, grabbing another beer from his fridge and popping it open, this is perfect timing. Kevin frowned. How is your wife stealing your business and running off with your investor? Perfect timing. See, what Angela and Victor didn't know was that three weeks ago, I'd gotten a call from the Chicago Health Department. Our truck had failed a surprise inspection. Major violations. That shut us down immediately. Broken refrigeration unit, leaking coolant into the food prep area. Outdated grease traps that hadn't been cleaned in months, expired permits that Angela was supposed to renew. Gas line issues that made the truck A literal fire hazard. The inspector told me we couldn't serve food anywhere in Illinois until we completed a full kitchen renovation. Estimated cost $50,000 minimum, plus months of downtime.

In court, my seven year old asked the judge, can I show you something daddy doesn't know? The judge nodded. She held up her tablet, pressed play. I'm Matt, 35, architect, divorced. I design schools during the day and build pillow forts with my seven year old daughter, Nora at night. She's the kind of kid who tapes cereal boxes into castles. We been living in the carriage house behind my parents place ever since Nora had a medical emergency that nearly wiped us out financially. It wasn't charity. I gutted that place. New floors, wiring, egress windows. I paid for everything. I paid rent, I paid utilities. I even paid their property taxes twice. And then there's Ava, my little sister, 30, works in event marketing. The family's golden retriever in human form. She shows up late, cries, cute, and always gets what she wants. When she walks into a room, my parents tilt the whole house toward her. And what she wanted was my house. It started with wine. At Sunday dinner. She twirled her glass and goes, it's kind of perfect back there. Like a starter home. I laughed. For who? She goes for me, obviously. I looked around. My mom was still plating asparagus like it was a cooking show. My dad kept cutting chicken like his fingers weren't numb. Nobody looked at me. I gave Nora both drumsticks because I suddenly Didn't want anything. Nobody said it out loud that night, but I could feel it shift. My sister had decided she wanted it, and they were already helping her get it. Next week, my mom asked to meet at a cafe. She shows up with a folder. Of course we've been talking, she says. About what? Ava's ready to buy. We think it's time to make the Carriage House official. I blinked. Official how? She wants to own it. She wants the house I live in. She's been saving. It's not for sale. She needs to build equity. I'm still raising your granddaughter in there. Mom slides the folder to me like she's handing over a spreadsheet. Inside, comps, catch of the lot line, and a draft lease termination. It gave me 90 days to get out. 90 days so Ava can start her journey. I said, no. They sued me. I stood on my porch holding the certified letter while Nora leaned on my leg, asking, why do you look mad? I'm just thinking. I said, because how do you explain to a seven year old that grandma and grandpa are evicting her so her aunt can post housewarming pics on Instagram? I pulled out everything. Rent receipts, emails, bank transfers labeled Carriage house, heat and taxes. The email from mom saying, thanks for handling the property stuff this year. Every time they pretended it wasn't a real rental, I had proof it was. And Ava, she kept showing Up hovering in my doorway like a real estate agent. I'd paint this wall, she said once, like I was already gone. Court day came. Ava wore white like she was accept in a diploma. My parents sat beside her like she was their emotional support animal. Their lawyer stood up, started in with permissive use, license revocation, reasonable expectation of ownership. He kept saying, first home like it was a holy calling. I stood and said, I paid for everything. I remodeled it with permission. I paid rent, I paid taxes. This isn't generosity. This is theft. Dressed up as family. The judge raised a brow. Do you have documentation? I slid over the folder. Every word. Ava stood up, blinking hard. I'm not trying to steal anything. I've worked really hard. I deserve a home. You do, I said. Just not mine.

And they finally Learned what she left them with. I married my husband when his twins were eight. Their mom had walked out two years earlier, leaving nothing but a note that said she needed to find herself. No calls, no birthday cards, nothing but to hear the kids talk. She was a saint who'd been driven away. Every family dinner was a war zone. I'd cook their favorites, and they'd push the plates away. Your meatloaf tastes weird. Real mom made it better. I'd help with homework and get accused of doing it wrong. Real mom was smarter. I bought them new clothes and heard how real mom had better taste. My husband would just sigh and say they needed time to adjust. Time? Like three years wasn't enough. The breaking point came on their 11th birthday.

So I made her leave my house with nothing. Rachel said she understood what she was signing up for when she married me. Ethan comes first, I told her on our third date. He's my son, my responsibility. She touched my hand across the table. That's what I love about you. Such a devoted father. Ethan was thriving at Riverside Academy. His math teacher said he had real potential for Advanced Placement. The tuition was $18,000 a year, but watching him grow confident, make friends, finally love learning after his mom's death. Worth every penny. Rachel moved in after the wedding and immediately had opinions. Private school is elitist, she said, watching me write the tuition check. My nephew goes to public school, and he's fine. Ethan's been through enough changes, I said. He needs stability. She rolled her eyes but dropped it. Then her daughter Chloe, from her first marriage, started visiting every other weekend. Why does Ethan get private school but Chloe doesn't? Rachel asked. That seems unfair. You said Chloe's dad pays for her education. I reminded her that was our agreement. Well, things change. Her father lost his job. I'm sorry to hear that, but I can't afford two private school tuitions. Then maybe Ethan should try public school. Build character. There it was. He's staying at Riverside. Two months later, I came home from a Business trip to find Ethan doing homework at the kitchen table. Why aren't you at chess club? Rachel, pick me up early. Rachel walked in holding papers. I withdrew him from Riverside. The public school is perfectly adequate. My vision went red. You did what? The semester was ending anyway. I thought it made sense to transition him now. You had no right. You're not his mother. I'm his stepmother. I'm trying to manage our household finances responsibly. By stealing my son's education? Stealing? That's dramatic. I redirected the funds somewhere more practical. What funds? Where? She pulled out her phone, showed me a bank statement. She'd taken the $9,000 I'd saved for spring semester and enrolled Chloe in Riverside. We needed this opportunity. She said she's struggling at public school. So you put my son there instead? It's temporary. Once I get my promotion, we can revisit Ethan's situation. Ethan stood in the doorway, eyes wet. I have to leave Riverside. Go to your room. Rachel said the adults are talking. Don't speak to my son that way. Our son. We're a family now. That night, I called my lawyer. Not for divorce papers, but for something better. Turns out, withdrawing a child from school without both parents consent when there's a custody agreement. Not legal. Even more interesting, using funds specifically earmarked for one child's education for another child. That's fraud.

It wasn't until my 7th birthday that I knew something was wrong with me. I was always in some type of pain or another. When I would tell my mom, she would say, it must be a cold. Go sleep it off. Sleeping it off never worked. Take some Tylenol. Only ease the pain enough to function. Why won't you take me to the doctors? I sobbed in absolute agony. You're faking it, so there's no reason to. My mom would always respond that way every time I asked. It left me feeling like I was insane, that the pain was all mental, coming out as physical symptoms. I never questioned her. When I hit my teens, it would only end in a screaming match that took almost everything out of me. I would sob in my room as my younger sister tried to ease my twitching muscles. This isn't normal, Maya would say. It hurts so bad. But when she was done with the massage, it did always feel better. My head drops. Thank you, Maya. It would become a ritual. After school and before bed, Maya would massage my muscles to keep them from locking up, twitching or staining at random times. It hurts so bad, I muttered as I made Maya and myself some. Why are you so overdramatic, my mom asked as she heard me. Because it feels like I am a pulled wire and one more twist and my whole body falls apart. Quit faking it. God, why can't I have a normal kid? I gaped at my mom. Mom, Maya is extremely talented in school for her age. That doesn't make her not normal. My mom rolls her eyes. My, the excellent and you the lazy liar. I grit my teeth. What the heck, mom, I say before turning around and making my way to Maya. Maya has tears flowing down her face as I give her a hug. You are brilliant and don't let anyone tell you differently. She squeezes my hand back. You are not lazy and I believe you. Glint enters my eyes. Go watch the door. Maya does as I ask, and I finally call a doctor on my behalf. It did help that I was 17 and could schedule a doctor's appointment on my own. I didn't need a parent either. The appointment was set for this coming Friday. Maya just looks at me and nods, good for you. Friday came and I still felt like I was an imposter that was about to waste.

Inside was a note saying they wouldn't support a marriage they didn't approve of. I smiled. A year later, when his company needed investors, I made sure every one of them knew exactly who he disowned. My fiance. Natalie wasn't from money. She was a public school teacher who grew up in a trailer park in rural Pennsylvania. Her mom worked double shifts at a diner. Her dad left when she was six. She put herself through college on scholarships and student loans she was still paying off. But she was brilliant, kind, and loved me unconditionally. She made me laugh. She challenged me. She was the first person who ever made me feel like I was enough. Just as I was. My family saw her as beneath us. My. My mother actually laughed when I announced our engagement at Sunday brunch. She set down her mimosa and said, you're throwing away your future for that? He looked at me like I betrayed the family legacy by falling in love with someone who didn't summer in the Hamptons. My. My older sister Claire pulled me aside. Just wait a year. Date her quietly. Find someone appropriate later. Like Natalie was a phase I'd outgrow. Six months before the wedding, my father called me into his study. Leather chairs, mahogany desk, walls lined with books he'd never read. He said they'd attend the wedding, but only if Natalie Signed a prenup, protecting the family assets. I laughed. What assets? You've already made it clear I'm getting nothing. He didn't flinch. It's about principle. About protecting what we've built. I refused. We weren't getting any of their money anyway. Natalie and I were both working, saving, building our own life. The wedding day came. Small ceremony at a botanical garden. Sixty guests, close friends, Natalie's mom crying in the front row. My family sat in the back, stone faced, dressed like they were attending a funeral. Right before I walked down the aisle, my father approached. He was holding a small wrapped box. Silver paper with a white ribbon. From the family, he said, his voice flat and cold. My hands shook as I opened it. Inside was a handwritten note on our family letterhead. We cannot in good conscience support a union we don't believe in. We have tried to guide you toward a better path, but you have chosen poorly. Consider this our final communication. You are no longer part of this family's legacy. We wish you well, but we will not be participating in this mistake. I read it twice. My chest felt tight. Then I looked up at my father, folded the note carefully, and said, thank you for making this easy. I smiled, tucked the note in my jacket pocket, and said, you

Most men would see the red flags. My wife replied, some men are just easy. I said nothing. A month later, she was crying in court, realizing the dumb husband had outsmarted her. I was sitting right there at the dinner table. They were both drunk, laughing like I wasn't even present. I forced a chuckle, pretending I was too drunk to care. But inside, something snapped. Blake and I had been married for five years. She was effortlessly charming, magnetic, the type who could work any room. I was the steady one, financially responsible, the guy who planned for the future while she lived in the moment. The worst part wasn't the comment itself. It was the casual way she said it, like mocking me to my face was just another joke. Like I was so trusting, so oblivious, that I'd never figure out what she was really doing. That night, after Blake fell asleep, I started digging. I checked our joint bank accounts. First small. And then her credit card statements. Bigger spending than usual. Then I checked her private savings account. That's when I saw it. Over the past six months, Blake had been moving money into a completely separate account. Small amounts at first, then larger ones. The transfers told a clear story. A couple hundred here, a few more there. Then three months ago, the withdrawals got serious. $2,000, then $4,000, then $7,500. She was building A financial safety net behind my back. But then there was more. Hotel booking. Two luxury weekend stays downtown, both when I'd been out of town for work. High end restaurant charges at places she never took me. Spa treatments, designer clothes. She wasn't just preparing for a divorce. She was already living like she'd left me. I scheduled a meeting with a divorce lawyer. What I Learned changed everything. Any money she secretly moved during marriage could be considered hidden assets. If I filed first, I controlled the narrative. If I could prove finance she'll misconduct, I could protect everything I'd worked for. The best part. If she thought she was in control, she'd get careless. So I started acting even dumber. I didn't question her spending. I became overly sweet, mentioning how I was thinking of moving money into a joint investment for our future. Blake took the bait completely. She relaxed.

She stood there for a full minute, waiting for me to engage. When it became clear I wasn't playing that role anymore, she left without another word. Three weeks in, she was losing her mind. She mentioned male co workers, talked about her ex reaching out, brought up how attentive other husbands were. Each comment was fishing for jealousy, any sign I still cared. My response was always, that's interesting. Then I'd return to whatever I was doing. I'd started hitting the gym, reading books, learning guitar. Something she'd always dismissed as a waste of time. One month in, she cracked. She was waiting at the kitchen table when I got home. Papers spread everywhere. We need to talk. You're punishing me because your feelings got hurt. My feelings got hurt? I repeated. You humiliated me in front of your friends, called five years of romantic gestures pathetic, and now that I've stopped, I'm being petty? The truth came out. She felt suffocated by being loved. She wanted me to care secretly, to pine for her while pretending I didn't need her. She wanted emotional security without reciprocation. When's the last time you did something romantic for me? I asked. When's the last time you made me feel like more than a roommate? Silence. We both knew it was never. You felt suffocated by being loved. I felt suffocated by being needed so much. Love without need is friendship with benefits. You wanted to feel special. Without making me feel special in return, I gave her an ultimatum. One month to earn my respect the same way I'd spent five years failing to earn her. She tried for three weeks. Coffee in the morning, favorite meals, asking about my guitar. But these were transaction, not gestures. She was trying to purchase my old behavior. Effort to get something isn't the same as effort to give something, I told her. The breaking point came when she tried recreating our first date. Same restaurant, similar dress, same wine. If I went back to bringing you flowers every week, would you call them pathetic again? I asked. She hesitated just long enough to give me my answer. The next morning, divorce papers were on the kitchen table. What's the point of love without romance? She asked during our final conversation. What's the point of romance without respect? The man who used to beg for love was gone.

My daughter Emma decided she was superior to humanity when her 4th grade teacher recommended her for the gifted program. Not just smart, but transcendent, above the mental capabilities of regular mortals, especially about her younger brother, Ryan. She started calling him the slow one at family dinners, would explain basic concepts to him in baby talk, even though he was only two years younger. When he'd ask for help with homework, she'd sigh dramatically and say things like, I'll try to dump it down to your processing level. Made charts ranking family members by IQ, with herself at the top, Ryan at the bottom below, our dog. I tried addressing it, but she'd pull out her standardized test scores, wave them around like divine prophecy. Brian handled it quietly, never fought back, never told teachers. When Emma announced to his classmates that he was adopted because our genes couldn't produce someone that dim, he focused on what he loved, taking things apart, building computers, fixing broken electronics. By middle school, neighbors paid him to repair their devices. Emma mocked this, too, called him a technician and manual labor was perfect for limited minds. Meanwhile, she coasted through advanced classes, never studied and turned in late work because geniuses don't follow conventional deadlines. Teachers let it slide because of her test scores. Ryan taught himself programming, started creating apps and never mentioned it at home because Emma would lecture about how coding Was just following instructions, not real intelligence. Six months ago, Emma got into an elite university through early admission. She demanded we throw a massive party to celebrate what she called the family's first intellectual achievement. During her speech at the party, she thanked everyone for their support, then specifically thanked Ryan for showing her what she didn't want to become. Actually said those words into a microphone in front of 100 people. Ryan left the party. Emma spent the rest of the night explaining to relatives how IQ was genetic destiny, how she'd probably cure cancer while Ryan would be lucky to manage a retail store. Started a blog called Thoughts From Above, where she reviewed books and ideas from her elevated perspective, frequently referencing her intellectually challenged brother as inspiration to help the less fortunate understand complex topics. Emma's first semester was supposed to be her coronation. She picked the hardest courses, told everyone she'd set the curve and everything, called home the first week to inform us her professors were intimidated by her intellect. But then midterms happened. She failed her computer science course. Not struggled, failed, zero ability to code, couldn't understand basic algorithms. Her professor suggested she might have a learning disability and computational thinking. Emma had a meltdown, demanded that the school investigate the professor for discrimination against gifted students. The administration reviewed her work, told her she needed a tutor. She called me sobbing about persecution, demanding we sue the university for emotional Distress. That's when Ryan offered to help her over winter break. Emma laughed, actually laughed at him, said she'd rather fail than take help from someone who barely graduated high school with the B average. Last week was the revelation. Emma failed out of computer science completely. Had to.

We've been done since our kid was one because Tyler decided being a full time parent wasn't for him. He gets our kid two weekends a month, and sometimes he doesn't even show up for those. I have primary custody and handle everything else. Three years ago, Tyler started dating someone. They got engaged in February. That's when things got weird. I started getting calls and texts from a random number. Like, a ton of them. Messages saying, answer the damn phone and call me back and I'd like to meet up and figure this out. I had no clue who this was or what they wanted from me. When I finally answered one of the calls, it was Tyler's fiance. She told me Tyler said I'd be cool with her picking up our kid for the day and taking them out. He gave her my number so we could plan it. Except Tyler never said a word to me about any of this. I told her I didn't know her and I wasn't handing my kid over to a stranger. I suggested she spend time with our kid during Tyler's weekends instead. She did not like that answer. After that call, Tyler started blowing up the co parenting app with requests for his fiance to take our kid out. Like, request after request. In July, he messaged me saying I was saying no too much and it was messing up his Relationship. I ignored that. Last month, she ended the engagement. She sent me a long text blaming me for everything. She wasn't going to stay somewhere. She was treated like stranger danger when she was supposed to be a stepmother. Tyler also blamed me. He said I sabotaged his relationship and chased away someone who could have been good for our kid. I told him I didn't care about his relationships. I cared about not letting someone I don't know take my kid. I pointed out he was the one who set her up. To think she could do that in the first place. Now Tyler's telling everyone I broke them up. His buddies make comments when they see me out. Most people don't buy it because everyone knows he barely shows up for his own kid. But this mom from my mom group told me I kind of did sabotage things. He said his fiance was just trying to bond with my kid, and I shut her down for no reason. She said most single moms with primary custody would be happy to have extra help. Then she said it was my ego that broke them up because I didn't want my kid to have a stepmom. We got into it after that I asked if she'd really let some random person her ex was dating just take her kid. And she said yes. She said she would have been fine with it. I told her, that's on Her. But I'm not doing that. She called me controlling. I left the group chat after that. Tyler's still mad. He keeps bringing it up every time he actually shows up for his weekend. Last time he came to pick up our kid, he stood at my door for 10 minutes saying I ruined his life. I shut the door on him. His fiance hasn't contacted me since the breakup text, but Tyler says she moved two hours away to get away from the situation. He acts like I forced her out of town.

You were never there. I didn't respond, but when I stood to speak, I played a video that made everyone gasp. This is your fault. You were never there. My ex wife, Rachel hissed it as we stood by our son's casket. Jake was 19. Gone in a car accident. Sudden, senseless. The kind of loss that hollows you out. Rachel's words should have broken me, but I'd heard them before. For 12 years, since the divorce, she painted me as the absent father, the one who chose work over family. The deadbeat who sent checks but never showed up. It wasn't true. But her narrative was louder than my truth. The funeral. 200 people filled the church. Jake's friends, Rachel's family, people who'd heard her version for years. They looked at me with pity or judgment. The father who failed. When it was time for eulogies, Rachel went first. She talked about raising Jake alone, about being both parents, about how hard it was when someone doesn't show up. She never said my name, but everyone knew. Then it was my turn. I walked to the podium slowly, carrying my laptop. I debated this for three days. Jake would have wanted the truth. He begged me to tell it for years. But I'd stayed quiet to keep the peace. Not anymore. I connected the laptop to the church's screen. Before I speak, I said my voice, steady, I want to show you something Jake sent me two months ago. The screen lit up. Jake's face appeared, recording a selfie video in his dorm room. Hey, dad, he said, smiling that crooked smile. I know Mom's family reunion is coming up, and I know she's probably going to do her usual thing, so I wanted to make this just in case. He took a breath. My dad didn't abandon me. He fought for me. When I was seven, he fought for joint custody. Mom told the court he was unstable, unreliable. She won primary custody. Dad got every other weekend. Then mom moved three hours away. Suddenly, those weekends became impossible. She'd schedule my soccer games during his time. Birthday parties, school events. Anything to make him choose between seeing me and looking like the bad guy who missed things. The church was silent. Jake continued. When I was 10, Dad asked to switch weekends so he could come to my championship game. Mom said no, said it wasn't his weekend. He drove six hours round trip anyway. Sat in the back of the bleachers so there wouldn't be a scene. I saw him. He waved. Mom saw him, too, and lost it. Told me after that dad was trying to manipulate me, but he just wanted to watch me play. Jake's eyes got watery. When I was 14, I asked to live with Dad. Mom cried, said I was betraying her. Said dad had poisoned

Mom hosts Thanksgiving every year at her place. It's me, my parents, my brother Jason and his wife and her family. We live all over the place, so this is basically the one time we see each other. Jason's in South Africa doing consulting work, and I'm constantly travelling for my job in tech sales. Mom loves Thanksgiving because it's her one guaranteed day with both her kids. Thing about my mom is she's always got something to say about my life. My career's too unstable. I'm 32 and still single. I dress too casual, my apartment's too small. She never does this to Jason. He's the golden child who can do no wrong. Dad always says it's just her way of showing she cares. But it doesn't feel that way when you're on the receiving end of it constantly. A few months back, I went through a rough patch. Got laid off and spent, like, two months on my couch, barely leaving the house. Mom found out, and now she treats me like I'm made of glass. And also somehow failing at life simultaneously. It's exhausting. So Thanksgiving rolls around, and mom emails everyone their assignments. I got dessert. She didn't say what kind, just that I was in charge of it. I hate pumpkins. They literally make me gag. The smell, the texture, all of it. So I made a maple cheesecake instead. Spent three hours On it the night before. It came out pretty decent with this caramel drizzle on top. Dinner itself was fine. We did the whole no politics thing and kept light, but mom kept making these little comments. Oh, you're wearing that sweater again. Have you been eating enough? You look thin. Still doing that traveling sales thing? Each one was like a tiny paper cut. By the time we cleared the main course, I was already on edge.

She didn't know I was the company founder conducting anonymous candidate assessments. The conference room was cold and Jennifer's expression was colder. Let's be honest, your resume is underwhelming, she said, barely looking at my application. State school, average GPA, internships at companies I've never heard of. I nodded, taking notes on her interview style. Frankly, I'm not sure why HR even scheduled this. We need top talent, not someone who's gonna need constant hand holding. Jennifer was our senior marketing director. According to HR complaints, she'd rejected 15 qualified candidates in three months, claiming none met her standards. Can you tell me about the team culture here? I asked. She laughed dismissively. If you got this position, which you won't, you'd be working with people far more experienced than you. They'd probably resent training someone so clearly out of their depth. For 20 minutes, she listed my inadequacies. My school wasn't prestigious enough. My previous internships were at no name startups. My portfolio showed basic work that any intern could produce. Any questions? She finally asked, checking her watch, what qualities do you look for in successful candidates? Candidates from target schools who already understand our industry, people who can contribute immediately, not learn on the job. She stood up. I'll be honest with you, Michael, you're wasting both our time. This position requires someone with real credentials. I appreciate your feedback. HR. Will Contact you, but don't wait around. You should probably look at entry level positions more suited to your background. Jennifer left me alone in the conference room. Five minutes later, our HR director, Rachel, appeared with my actual team. How bad was it? Rachel asked. Worse than the complaint suggested. She didn't ask a single substantive question about my skills or experience. My CTO, David, shook his head. Did she mention why we have 3 vacant positions on her team? She said the company needs top talent, implied the previous candidates weren't qualified enough. Rachel pulled out her tablet. Jennifer's rejected every candidate we've sent her, then complains to executives that we can't find good people. She spent the entire interview telling me I went to the wrong school and worked at the wrong companies. David looked frustrated. Michael, you founded this company six years ago. Your no name startups were successful exits that funded our Series A. She never asked about those details, just saw state school and dismissed everything else. Rachel pulled up Jennifer's file. She's been blocking talent acquisition for months, but leadership wanted.

She thought I was going to cry, but I smiled. Then dad came in shouting at me, where are the $15,000 we prepared for your sister's college? My name is Valerie and I'm 22, still living at home while saving money from my job at a tech startup. My sister Bella is 19 and in college, getting everything handed to her while I had to work my way through school. Last month, our parents hit financial trouble when Dad's business took a. They've been secretly selling family heirlooms and Mom's jewelry to scrape together Bella's tuition. They got exactly $15,000 in cash. I watched dad count those bills with shaking hands. Grandma's wedding ring, the antique watch, your mother's pearls, everything we had left, he whispered to mom. Mom was crying quietly. At least Bella won't have to drop out. She doesn't need to know what we sacrificed. Dad asked me to deposit it at the bank since he had client meetings trying to save his business. I placed the envelope in my desk drawer under textbooks, planning to go after work. When I got home, Bella was strutting around our living room like she owned the place. She had a brand new designer handbag, expensive clothes with tags attached and the latest iPhone Pro Max. He was on the phone twirling around in her new outfit. Yeah, babe, I sent you the $8,000 like I promised. For your car payments. Don't worry about paying it back right away. My heart sank. I ran to my room, yanking open the desk drawer. I searched frantically. The envelope was gone. I stared at the empty drawer, hands shaking. All those family treasures sold for nothing. Bella, where's the money from my desk? She rolled her eyes like I was being dramatic. that I found it just sitting there when I came home early to surprise, surprise everyone. I figured it was family money just lying around. I'm family, right? She held up her new phone and took a selfie, then showed me the screen. You should see your face right now. You look absolutely insane. This is hilarious. I watched her posing with her designer bags, completely oblivious to what she'd done. She'd sent $8,000 to some boyfriend I'd never even met, spent thousands more on herself, and was treating it like a joke. Instead of screaming or crying like she clearly expected, I smiled a calm, knowing smile. You're absolutely right. It is family money. That's when we heard Dad's truck pull into the driveway. His engine was making that grinding noise again, the one he couldn't afford to fix. Dad walked in through the front door, his face already red from stress about his failing business. His work clothes were dusty. His hands were rough from taking on manual labor jobs to make ends meet. Valerie, did you deposit the money? The tuition payment is Due tomorrow morning. And he stopped mid sentence, his eyes landing.

I've been collecting Stanley Cups for about three years now. I have maybe 20 of them, but I swear I actually use them. My 26 year old sister couldn't have cared less about them until two months ago when they started showing up on her TikTok feed. Suddenly she was an expert collector who needed every limited edition colour. She doesn't even drink water, so the cups just sit on a shelf in her room for photos. She still lives with our parents and they act like every purchase she makes is some kind of amazing achievement. When I heard target was dropping a new Halloween design, I knew it would be chaos. I got to the store at 5:00am and there was already a line of about 40 people. I waited like everyone else, grabbed one cup, and paid for it. I was walking to my car when I heard someone screaming my name across the parking lot. My sister was sprinting toward me with my mom speed walking behind her. My sister was in pajamas and one slipper and my mom was in a bathrobe that was flapping open. I must have jumped out of bed when they saw my Instagram story. My sister ran up and grabbed my shoulders. Oh thank god. You got one? Give it to me right now! Not asking. Commanding. I pulled away. What No. I waited in line for this. Her face went from relieved to furious. Are you serious right now? You have, like, a million of these at home. I need this one. I told her to try going inside to see if there were any left. They're already sold out. Just give it to me. My mom caught up, breathing hard, and put her hand on my shoulder. Honey, why don't you just let your sister have this one? It means a lot to her. Mom. I got here at 5 a m. For this. My sister's voice got really high. You don't even care about Stanley's like I do. This is my whole thing now. Everyone knows I collect them. My mom nodded along. Can you please just be the bigger person? I held the cup against my chest. No.

Two weeks later, she was arrested. I spent months planning my daughter's 8th birthday. She wanted pineapple themed everything. After some cartoon obsession, I ordered a custom three tier cake for $280. Ridiculous, I know, but she deserves something special. My sister showed up 45 minutes late, no apology. Her six year old son looked miserable, eyes puffy like he'd already been crying. I should have known something was wrong. I was organizing a game when I heard my daughter scream. Not a fun scream, genuine distress. I ran to the kitchen and saw my sister holding my beautiful cake over the trash can. What are you doing? I yelled. He doesn't like pineapple. He wants chocolate. I need money to go buy a proper cake. Before I could process, she dropped the entire cake, hit the bottom with this horrible splat. Frosting exploded everywhere. My daughter burst into full body sobs. Her friends stood frozen, mouths open. For the first time, I refused to stay silent. I grabbed my sister's arm and dragged her through the house. She fought me. Her son was wailing. I got her onto the porch and years of suppressed anger finally erupted. She tried to slap me. I caught her wrist and shoved her. She fell on the lawn. That's when my parents pulled up. Growing up, my Sister was the golden child. When I was 12, they gave away my pet rabbit because she was allergic. When I was 15, they canceled my quinceanera and use the $5,000 for her Europe trip. When I made honor roll every semester, they said good job. When she got a B instead of her usual C, they took her for ice cream. I got into college on scholarship and worked my ass off. She barely graduated high school and lived with my parents for years. When I got pregnant, married and financially stable, my mom asked if it would interfere with babysitting my sister's son. I grabbed her arm. It wasn't about a cake. It was about 31 years of being invisible. My parents immediately helped her up. My sister started crying. She attacked me. She destroyed my daughter's 300 dollar birthday cake. I said it was just a cake. My mom said, did you really need to get violent? Just a cake? Those words confirmed everything. My feelings didn't matter. My daughter's ruined birthday didn't matter. Nothing had changed. Nothing would ever change. Get off my property, I said, all of you. They left. But that night my sister posted a video showing me dragging her out and pushing her down. No context, just me looking like a psycho. Caption, should I press charges? The video got 10,000 views overnight. Hundreds of comments calling me abusive. My co workers saw it. My boss saw it. I tried commenting to Explain, but she blocked me. Then karma struck. Two weeks later, my nephew attacked another kid at school and bit a teacher hard enough to break skin. My sister screamed about discrimination. The video went viral. People started commenting on her posts about me, pointing out the irony of her calling me abusive while her son.

So I put a stop to our fake marriage. We've been married for five years, and I thought I was being the perfect husband. I spent three hours cooking her favorite meal for our anniversary, set up candles, even dug out that playlist from our first date. When she walked through the door with her sister and best friend, she took one look at the setup, rolled her eyes, and said, loud enough for everyone to hear, stop trying to be romantic, it's pathetic. You desperate? Then she turned to her friends. This is exactly what I was telling you about. He does this needy stuff constantly. The room went dead silent. Her sister looked uncomfortable. Her best friend stared at the floor. I stood there holding wine, watching my wife destroy our marriage with one sentence. I set the wine down, looked her straight in the eye, and said, you know what? You're absolutely right. She expected me to apologize, to scramble. Instead, I started blowing out the candles. What are you doing? She asked, losing that confident edge. Stopping, I replied. Gathering the flowers. Romance is pathetic when it's one sided, so I'm done being pathetic. I tossed the flowers in the trash and ordered pizza. We can eat like roommates from now on. Pepperoni or cheese? That night, she tried damage control, talking about bad days, overreacting. But something had shifted in me. I heard you perfectly. I told her, message received. No more romantic gestures. No more pathetic behavior. She laughed it off. Maybe we both need to be more realistic about what marriage actually is. Those words would haunt her the next morning. I didn't bring her coffee in bed like I had every weekend for five years. When she came downstairs expecting her usual cup, I was finishing mine. Coffee is in the kitchen, I said without looking up. I saw our marriage clear. Really? For the first time. I was the one planning date nights she'd complain about. I was the one remembering anniversaries. I was the one keeping romance alive. When I stopped being romantic, I stopped with everything unnecessary. No more good morning kisses. No more asking about her day. No more caring where she went. By day 10, the cracks showed. You going to ask me about my presentation? She said, clearly fishing. Do you want to tell me about it? Well, it went well, she said, waiting for follow up questions that never came. Good for you. I went.

I was trying to impress her with some fancy Italian place, but they messed up our reservation. We ended up at the KFC across the street because everything else was closed. We sat there for three hours, just talking and laughing over a bucket of chicken. She told me about her weird uncle who collects bottle caps. I told her about the time I accidentally dyed my hair green in sixth grade. It was perfect. After that, it became our thing. Our spot. The employees knew us by name. They'd save our usual table by the window. Jasmine always got the same thing. Popcorn, chicken, coleslaw, and that fruit punch they have. I'd get whatever was on sale, and we'd share everything anyway. But then things got hard. Really hard. My mom got sick last winter. Like, hospital visits three times a week kind of sick. My boss cut my hours because business was slow. I was stressed, broke and exhausted all the time. I stopped texting Jasmine back as fast, stop asking about her day. Even our Sunday nights got quiet. I Just sit there picking at my food while she tried to start conversations that went nowhere. She never complained, though. She just kept showing up, kept asking if I was okay, kept trying. And I felt like garbage because I knew I was pushing her away without meaning to. One night, she didn't order her usual. Just got a small drink and said she wasn't hungry. That's when I knew I'd really messed up. Jasmine never skipped food at KFC. Never. I went home that night and couldn't sleep.

Weekly coffee, real conversations, apologies. So when I bring it up, she offers to help. And I'm like, yeah, okay, maybe we're actually fixing this. I give her the spare key, show her where the cat food is stored, leave a list on the counter. Super simple stuff. Water the plants every three days, feed Apollo twice daily. That's it.

Everyone said I was insane. When my boyfriend Pedro proposed, I saw an opportunity. You see, his girl best friend, Fiona, had been a pain in the neck the entire relationship. She had spread awful lies about me at the start, ruined a couple of dates by showing up uninvited, and even tried to accidentally kiss Pedro using some TikTok trend. But I dealt with mean girls before and high school taught me that sometimes the best way to expose someone is to give them exactly what they want and let them destroy themselves. So that's exactly what I did. When I told Pedro I'd really love it if Fiona planned our engagement party, my mom actually begged me not to do it. My best friend said I was setting myself up for disaster. But I just smiled and said Pedro believes in her and I believe in Pedro. Maybe we'd all been misunderstanding her intentions. She deserves a chance to prove herself, I told them gently. And when we told Fiona, she was thrilled, of course, not knowing I was the one hanging the poisoned apple by a thread. The planning phase started pretty typically for Fiona. She showed up to our first meeting with invite mission samples for the party, but they were drawn with crayon, clearly created to be ugly and unprofessional. My friends exchanged horrified looks, but I just smiled and started adding ribbons. And pressed flowers, old baby photos of Pedro and me onto the invites. Suddenly they looked adorable and unique. Fiona say so when everyone complimented them. Then came the venue booking. She'd somehow reserved the wrong date and ordered bland decorations. All problems I quickly fixed too. And soon people were starting to see the pattern. The engagement party itself was where things really escalated. Fiona had been in charge of the seating chart and strategically positioned herself between me and Pedro at the head table. I watched as people whispered and stared at her with confused expressions. Even Pedro's mom mentioned out loud that it was odd. I let the awkward tension stretch until it was absolutely painful. Then I finally spoke up with a bright smile and said, Fiona, you're so funny. You've switched our seats by accident, right? Fiona's face paled, suddenly being put on the spot. She quietly agreed and switched spots, but she still hadn't Learned her lesson. An hour in, Fiona got up to play the slideshow she had prepared. It was supposed to be about our relationship, but maybe 80% of it was just photos of her and Pedro growing up.

I'm the middle kid, not the golden one, not the disaster, the background. The one who covers gas money, hands over tips when things are tight. My brother Mason gets everything. New phone, graduation trip, business funds. My sister Ivy gets therapy and never complained about that. But my tips always ended up as co pays and parking money. I kept track on my phone. $25 gas, $40 appointment, $60 Mason emergency. $120. Will repay Friday. Friday never came. I stopped tracking at $2,380 because the total made me feel stupid. Grandma set up a trust for all three grandkids. College funds, first car, and money for your 21st birthday. My parents handled the paperwork because grandma forgets passwords. On my 21st, I came home after a double shift. Sheet cake on the counter. Dad pulled out a folded Bill and slid it across the table. Your grandma sent this for you. $50 50, I said, mom. Smile tightened. Don't be ungrateful, Caleb. A month later, grandma came to visit. She took my hand. Honey, did you get the $10,000 I sent for your birthday? I only got $50. Grandma slammed her palm on the table. The forks rattled. What She shouted, what did they give you? Mom's smile cracked. Dad looked at this dealing. Grandma told me to come by the next afternoon. No parents. Bring your bank statements. Bring anything they asked you to sign. I showed up with a folder. We sat at her kitchen table. Withdrawals labeled Household Reimbursement. Transfer is marked for Mason's business. A transfer two weeks before my birthday. $10,000 from the trust to a joint account with my name and my parents'names. I'd never seen that account. My signature was on the form, but it wasn't mine. Is that your handwriting? No. She took a photo and called someone. An hour later, my parents walked in. Mason followed. Where is Caleb's $10,000? Dad laughed. Mom, for the love of. Where is Caleb's $10,000? Grandma cut him off. Mason shifted. It went to expenses. Whose expenses? Family. Dad said, we plan to make it right. Mom looked at me.

Five years later, he asked why I never went back to school. The offer came the day after my high school graduation. 50 grand, dad said, sliding a check across the kitchen table. Cash, right now. You come work for me instead of going to state. I stared at the check. My name, $50,000, signature at the bottom. I got into the engineering program. I know. And you'll spend four years learning theory while going $60,000 in debt. Or you can start making real money tomorrow, learn a real trade. Mom was doing dishes, didn't turn around, but her shoulders were tense. It's a good school, dad. It's a waste. My company is doing $2 million a year. You could be running it someday. But I need someone I can trust on job sites now. The check sat between us $50,000. My tuition deposit was $500. I'd already sent it. What if I want to do both? Work summers, go to school during. This is an either or offer, Cole. You want the money, you commit full time. No college. I looked at mom. She was gripping the edge of the sink. Take the night to think about it, dad said. But I need an answer by morning. Got three projects starting Monday. I didn't sleep. Just stared at that check on my nightstand. In the morning, I took the money. The first year was good. I Learned framing, electrical, plumbing. Dad paid me $22 an hour, which felt like a fortune. I bought a truck, got my own apartment. My high school friends came home for Christmas break with stories about meal plans and freshman seminars. I showed them my new F1 50. Year 2, dad made me a site supervisor. $28 an hour. More responsibility, longer hours. I was good at it, really good. The crew respected me because I worked as hard as they did. Year 3, I started noticing things. Dad's bids were getting rejected. We lost a commercial project to a firm that used computer modeling. That did. The owner kept mentioning his son. The one with the civil engineering degree. That's just fancy drawings, dad said. We build with our hands. But the jobs kept going to the guys with the fancy drawings. Year four, Dad had a health scare. Nothing serious, but enough to slow him down. He started talking about me taking over sooner than planned. You'll run this whole operation by the time you're 30, he said. Better than any degree. I was making $32 an hour.

When they scanned it, three agents surrounded me. Ma'am, this passport was reported lost 12 years ago. I was 22, heading to Toronto for a job interview. It was my first real shot at a corporate position after graduating, and I'd spent weeks preparing. My hands were shaking as I handed over my passport. Not from nerves about the interview, but because I hate flying. The agent scanned it, paused, and again, then ran it through a third time. She looked up at me with this expression I'll never forget. Half confusion, half alarm. Can you step aside, please? My stomach dropped. I watched other passengers move through security while I stood frozen by the metal detector. Two more agents appeared within seconds. One of them was older, maybe in his fifties. This stern face that made me want to cry. Ma'am, come with us. They pulled me into a small office behind the security checkpoint. White walls, two chairs, a desk with a computer. The door closed behind me with a heavy click. When did you last use this passport? Last summer. I went to Greece with friends. Why? What's wrong? The older agent sat down across from me, holding his hands on the desk. This passport was reported lost in 2012 by a Diane Fletcher. That's you, correct? Yes, but I've never reported anything lost. I've had this passport since I was 16. I've used it multiple times. They Exchanged glances. The younger agent left the room without saying anything. I sat there for 20 minutes, watching the clock, knowing I was about to miss my flight. My phone buzzed with text from the recruiter asking if I'd boarded yet. I couldn't answer. They'd taken my phone. Finally, the older agent returned with a stack of printed documents, spread them across the desk like he was revealing cards in a poker game. We need to ask you something. Do you know a woman named Patricia Fletcher? My blood went cold. That's my aunt. My mom's younger sister. The fun aunt who always brought expensive gifts to Christmas, who took me shopping for my prom dress, who I'd known my entire life. She's my aunt. Why? Patricia Fletcher reported this passport stolen in 2012, claiming it belonged to her. She's been using a replacement passport under your identity for over a decade. The room started spinning. I'm sorry, what? She's been travelling internationally under your name. We've tracked trips to Mexico, the Bahamas, England, France, and Spain. She opened three credit cards in your name, took out a car loan, even got married in Nevada two years ago. I couldn't breathe. My Aunt Patricia, the one who babysat me every weekend when I was little, who came to every single birthday party, who my mom trusted more than anyone, she. I'd stolen my identity when I was 16, before I'd even use my passport. Once the agent slid a photo. Across the table, security camera footage from an airport. It was Patricia

So my sister Rachel moved in with me about two months ago. She's 34, I'm 36. And she brought her two kids, Tyler, who's 7, and Mia, who's 4. She just got out of this relationship that was really bad, like the kind where you don't want to ask too many questions because you already know it sucked. I told her she could stay as long as she needed to get back on her feet. Now, I've always been one of those people who wakes up early, like 7 or 8:00am I'm up making breakfast. Nothing crazy, some eggs, toast, maybe pancakes if I'm feeling it, just normal stuff. When Rachel first moved in, I noticed she was sleeping in a lot, and I mean a lot. Some days she wouldn't come downstairs until one PM at first I didn't say anything because I figured she was going through it. You know, breakups are rough and she probably needed the rest. But here's the thing, while she was sleeping until the afternoon, Tyler and Mia were up by like 7:00am, come downstairs all groggy in their pajamas and I'd be there cooking. So naturally I started making extra for them. It just felt like the right thing to do. They're little kids. They need to eat breakfast. This went on for weeks. Every morning I'd make enough scrambled eggs or waffles or whatever for all three of us. The kids seemed Happy. I didn't mind. And Rachel got to sleep. Then one morning I woke up really wanting huevos, rancheros. I don't know why. I just had a craving. So I started cooking them up, beans, tortillas, salsa, eggs, the whole thing. Tyler came down first, took one look at the pan and went, Ew, what is that? I don't want that. Mia came down right after and just copied her brother. I don't want that either. I tried to explain it was good. They should at least try it. But Tyler crossed his arms and said, can you make us pancakes instead? I looked at the stove, looked at them, and honestly, I just caved. I made them pancakes while I ate my wavels. Rancheros alone, whatever, right? They're kids. The next morning I made breakfast potatoes with scrambled eggs and cheese. Pretty standard stuff. But the second I put.

The crowd smiled, nodding along. And Sarah, my girlfriend of eight years, she's been there, too. In fact, she's been incredibly close with Marcus lately. Sarah's face went pale. A few people shifted uncomfortably. So close that I found them in the wine cellar this afternoon reconnecting in a very special way. Gasps. Marcus stood up. Dude, what are you? I pulled out my phone, connected it to the projector they'd set up for the wedding slideshow. The screen behind me lit up with photos, Marcus and Sarah at a hotel, time stamps, six months worth of pictures I'd found on her cloud backup after I went home and checked. But here's my favorite part. I continued. Voice steady. I found out this morning that every single one of you knew my entire friend group has been laughing at me for months. Play the audio recording from my phone. Their voices from the groomsmen suite crystal clear, laughing about covering for the affair. The room was dead silent except for someone's fork hitting their plate. So here's my toast, I said, raising my glass to Marcus and Elena, may your marriage be as faithful as my friendship was. May you trust each other as much as I trusted all of you. And may you remember this moment every single anniversary. I set the microphone down, walked past Sarah who was crying, past Marcus who looked destroyed, past the entire table of former friends with their mouths Hanging open, Elena, the bride, was standing now staring at Marcus with pure betrayal on her face. Apparently, she didn't know either. I drove home that night, blocked everyone's numbers and haven't spoken to any of them since. My phone exploded with messages, voice mails, people trying to explain. I deleted them all without listening. Three days later, I got a call from Elena's lawyer. She wants my testimony for the annulment. Apparently, infidelity before the marriage is even consummated is solid grounds. I'm giving her every photo, every message, every piece of evidence I have. Sarah showed up at my apartment last week. I watched her through the doorbell camera crying on my doorstep for 40 minutes. I never opened the door. She doesn't live here anymore. None of them exist in my world anymore. I'm building a new life now. Real friends, honest people.

When I was 13, my mom had an affair and left my dad for Jeff. At first, me and my brother visited every weekend. She seemed like a good mom then, even though I never liked Jeff. But when she got pregnant with his daughter, everything changed. Our visits became less frequent. She'd miss my recitals, my brother's competitions, always busy with her new family. When I was 16, Jeff got a job offer. Me and my brother begged her not to move 10 hours away. I still remember her exact words, I need to prioritize my family. That's when I knew we weren't her family anymore. I went. No contact that day. My brother stayed in touch, but I was done. She tried for years, calling, showing up at the house, sending relatives to get help me. I didn't invite her to my high school graduation or college. I avoided family events just to stay away from her. I even skipped my own brother's wedding because she'd be there. Now I'm 33 and engaged. Three months ago, she moved back to our hometown with Jeff and her kids. The harassment went nuclear. My half siblings messaging me about what a great mom she is. Jeff calling me pathetic, saying I need therapy. I told him he was a homewrecking man whore and blocked Him. But then everyone started turning on me. My dad, my brother, my grandparents, aunts, uncles, even my friends, all saying I'm being unreasonable, that she tried her best, that I pushed her away. The worst part, my fiance, Laura, started siding with them, too. Last week I confronted her about it. She told me she'd been talking to my mom, hearing both sides of the story. She said my mom loved me and was heartbroken that I was being unreasonable about her moving away when I was young. Then Laura said something that destroyed me. Everyone can see the truth, but you look in the mirror, you're the problem. I asked her why she wouldn't support me. She said she loved me but wouldn't stand by and watch me be a heartless bad. I told her not to marry one then and walked out. That's when I started digging. Turns out Laura's mom is friends with my mom. They've been planning this together. But I found something else, something way worse. My mom had secretly paid for most of our wedding, the venue, the catering, the photographer, the flowers, the EJ, everything Laura told me her family paid for. My mom thought she could buy her way back into my life, buy a seat at my wedding, buy forgiveness. I spent all of yesterday on the phone. I called every single vendor, told them the situation, that someone had paid for services without my knowledge or consent. I asked Them to refund her cards completely and cancel everything unless they'd work with me on payment plan. Most of them were understanding. Some even seemed angry on my behalf. The photographer said, that's manipulative as hell. We'll work with you. The venue manager said they'd honor my original deposit and let me pay the difference over six months. The baker canceled my mom's order entirely and said she'd make our cake at cost. By the end of the day, my mom had zero control over my wedding. Every vent.

We were dramatic kids who watched too many spy movies, so we shook on it. Pinky promised. Left hand equals help me. 23 years and she'd never used it once.

Brandon appeared beside her, signing and speaking simultaneously. I grabbed her arm and she flinched hard. Stay longer, I said. Brandon laughed that easy laugh everyone trusted. Three hours is enough, man. I looked directly at Sabrina, ignoring him. Do you want to stay? She glanced at Brandon first before shaking her head. And that one glance told me everything I needed to know. I didn't let go of her arm. I'm asking her, not you, my dad. Walked over from the kitchen. Going on? Sabrina signed with her right hand. I'm fine. But the hand trembled visibly. Brandon squeezed her shoulder, and she went completely rigid, her face draining of all colour.

My mom's face hardened instantly. After everything Brandon has done for this family. Brandon held up his hands in that haughty gesture everyone loved so much.

So on day 15, I left flowers with a note, thank you for the best two weeks of our marriage. When she stormed into the kitchen furious, she found divorce papers with another note, now let's make it the best year of my life. The silent treatment started over a stupid argument about money. I'd suggested maybe she could work more than part time instead of spending $200 on skincare every month. Apparently that was crossing the line. For 14 days, she pretended I didn't exist. She'd cook for herself and leave my dishes dirty, do her laundry and leave mine wet in the washer until it smelled like mildew, order expensive takeout for herself and eat it right in front of me. But here's the twisted part. She answer her phone immediately when friends called. Suddenly she was all laughter and conversation. The moment she hung up, I was invisible again. By day 5, I realized what this really was, not hurt feelings, but a power play. She was training me like a dog, expecting me to crack and beg for forgiveness. The problem with her plan, I started enjoying the peace. No constant criticism about how I loaded the dishwasher, no complaints about my noise when I wanted to watch sports, no lectures about leaving my work boots by the door. So I decided to play along, but not how she expected. I pulled my guitar out of the closet. Where it had been buried under her clothes for months. See, I used to play every evening after work, but she'd killed that with constant comments. That's giving me a headache. Do you have to play the same song over and over? Are you sure you're actually good at that? Well, if she was ignoring me, she couldn't complain about noise, could. I set up right in the living room and started playing Rusty as hell, but I felt alive again. I heard her footsteps freeze upstairs. Then her bedroom door slammed so hard the house shook. I smiled and kept playing. Over the next week, I reclaimed everything, rearranged the furniture so I could actually watch TV comfortably, started cooking food I wanted to eat instead of her Pinterest disasters. She'd hover around the kitchen while I grilled steaks, clearly wanting some, but couldn't ask without breaking her own game. The breakthrough came on Day 14. I was working on a tricky guitar solo, hitting wrong notes, starting over. She was getting more agitated with every mistake, slamming things in the kitchen. Finally, she cracked. Jesus Christ, are you sure you ever knew how to play that thing? It sounds like you're torturing a cat. Three seconds of silence as she realized what she'd done. I looked at her calmly. Oh, so you can hear me? Interesting. She turned red and stormed upstairs. But here's what hit me. Even after two weeks of silence, her first words were still Designed to tear me down. That told me everything I needed to know. The next morning, I took a personal day and visited a divorce attorney. Two hours later, I had the papers ready. That evening, I wrote two notes. First, needed to catch her off guard without giving away the surprise. The second was direct and final. Day 15, I placed white lilies on the kitchen table with the first note, thank you for the best two weeks of our marriage. She found them when she came down for work. Confusion first, then a smile as she misread the message, thinking I was fine.

Her lawyer was aggressive, smug. My lawyer was a shark. At the first mediation, Jennifer sat across from me, arms crossed. My attorney, Davis, slid a folder across the table. Let's discuss assets. Jennifer's lawyer opened it. His face went gray. Inside were property deeds, stock portfolios, trust documents, bank statements showing years of rental income, investment gains, and compounding growth. Jennifer's eyes widened. What is this? These are my clients assets, Davis said calmly. Acquired before the marriage through inheritance, held in a separate trust, not marital property. Jennifer grabbed the papers, hands shaking. You've had millions this whole time. Her voice cracked. While I worked, while I sacrificed, while I went without, you were secretly rich. I met her eyes while you called me weak, while you humiliated me in front of our son, while you told everyone I was worthless. I was watching. Watching to see if you'd love me when you thought I had nothing. Her face twisted. This is manipulation. No, I said quietly. This is clarity. You showed me exactly who you are. Her lawyer leaned in. We can contest the trust. Davis smiled. You can try. It's iron clad. Separate property, premarital, untouchable. The mediation ended with Jennifer getting nothing. No house, no. No spousal support. Just child support calculated on my manager salary. And I got full custody after Tyler testified he wanted to live with me. That night, Tyler asked, dad, why didn't you tell her? Because I needed to know the truth, I said. And now I do. Jennifer tried calling for weeks, apologizing, begging, claiming she'd been stressed, that she didn't mean it. But I'd heard her laugh on that phone call. Heard her call me dead weight. Six months later, Tyler and I moved into a bigger house. When I paid for in cash. Jennifer posted on social media about betrayal, about deception. Her friends rallied. Some of mine questioned me. I didn't defend myself. I just kept living, kept being the father Tyler deserved. And every time someone asked if I regretted not telling her, I think back to that dinner. Your father is weak. That's why we have nothing. I'd smile and say, no regrets. I found out exactly what I needed to know.

So my friends and I were on a group call one night. Just the usual chaos. I join late, everyone's already laughing about something, and I jump right in like, Yo, what did I miss? No answer. Weird. I keep talking, guys, hello? But they just keep going like I'm invisible. Then they start roasting me. Bro, remember when he tried to flirt with the barista and she asked if he wanted a kid's up? Everyone's dying, laughing. I'm yelling, that was one time! But of course they can't hear me. I try waving at the camera. Nothing. Then another friend goes, nah. My favorite was when he said, you too to the waiter. After they said, enjoy your meal, they're howling. I'm sitting there defending myself to no one. I start typing in chat, I can hear you. No response. One of them goes, he's probably too embarrassed to join the call. At this point, I'm practically screaming into the void, mashing buttons like I'm trying to send Morse code through discord. Finally, I realize my mic's muted. It's been muted for five straight minutes. I unmute and shout, I was here the whole time, you clowns! Entire call explodes with laughter. One guy says, bro, you muted yourself just to prove our point. My friend goes, hey, man, you were muted. We just filled the silence. Now every time I join a call, they all Go! Quick, roast him before he unmutes. Let's just say I didn't join that call. I survived it.

I moved in with Jake and Morgan last September. The rent was cheap, the apartment was decent, and they seemed normal during the tour. Red flag No. 1. Morgan's laugh when I asked about the chore schedule. We're pretty relaxed about that stuff. Just do what feels natural. For the first month, I did what felt natural. I cleaned my dishes, wiped down counters after cooking, vacuumed the common areas once a week. Basic adult stuff. But Jake and Morgan, they lived like feral raccoons. Pizza boxes stacked on the coffee table for days. Their dishes breeding civilizations in the sink. The bathroom looked like a crime scene. I started cleaning their messes because I couldn't stand living in filth. Huge mistake. By month two, they stopped even pretending to clean. Morgan would walk past her crusted cereal bowl, look at me, and say, the maid will get it. They both laughed like it was hilarious. I forced a smile, thinking it was a bad joke. It wasn't. Last month, I came home from a 12 hour shift to find them hosting a party. 15 people crammed into our apartment, beer cans everywhere. Someone had spilled an entire bag of chips into the carpet. When I asked what happened, Jake grinned. Don't worry. We knew you'd handle it. You always do. That's when Morgan chimed in, yeah, you're basically our personal maid at this point. Might as Well, own it. Everyone laughed. I stood there holding my work bag, exhausted, humiliated. And something inside me just snapped. I smiled. You're right. I should own it. The next morning, I started my plan. I moved every single cleaning product I bought into my locked bedroom. My dish soap, my sponges, my paper towels, my toilet cleaner, everything. Then I stopped cleaning anything that wasn't mine. Not one fork, not one counter. Nothing. Day three. Jake knocked on my door. Hey, do you have any dish soap? We're out. Check under the sink, I said sweetly. There's nothing there. Weird. Guess you'll have to buy some. His face twitched. It's just dish soap. Can't you share? I smiled wider. Sorry. Personal maid.

The sound of shattering glass pulled me from sleep, followed immediately by Diana's voice screaming my name. I sat up so fast my head spun, heart already racing. Before my brain could process what was happening, the clock glowed. 2:00am Diana burst through my bedroom door, face wild with terror and streaked with mascara. She grabbed my shoulders hard enough to leave Marks. Nora, he's coming. Michael's coming right now. We have maybe 10 minutes. Tried to pull away because Diana had been spiraling for months, ever since she'd quit her job at Riverside Forensic Hospital. But her grip was iron and her eyes had this clarity that cut through my confusion, making my stomach drop with sudden cold fear. Diana had been a psychiatric nurse at Riverside for eight years before she abruptly quit three months ago with no explanation. She'd stopped returning my calls, cancelled our weekly dinners, went silent about what had happened at work. When I'd pressed her, she'd mentioned a difficult patient and ethical concerns but never elaborated. Now she was in my apartment at 2:00am, having broken my window to get inside, telling me someone named Michael was on his way to kill me. She pulled me out of bed and started shoving clothes at me from my dresser. I found his file. Today I broke into the hospital records because something felt wrong about his discharge. She thrust a vanilla folder at me with shaking hands. Inside was a patient photo clipped to the cover. Michael Reeve stared back with pale blue eyes that seemed too intense even in a standard medical photograph. The diagnosis notes listed obsessive personality disorder, erotomania and delusional misidentification syndrome. Diana flipped to progress notes highlighted in yellow marker. He became fixated on me during treatment, told staff we were engaged, that I visited him at night. I reported everything. But they moved him to a different unit and his new therapist thought he was making progress. Her voice cracked on the word progress. She had a fresh bruise on her forearm that looked like finger marks. The next pages made my skin crawl. Screenshots from social media showing someone had been photographing me for months. Candid shots taken from.

When they scanned it, three agents surrounded me. Ma'am, this passport was reported lost 12 years ago. I was 22, heading to Toronto for a job interview. It was my first real shot at a corporate position after graduating, and I'd spent weeks preparing. My hands were shaking as I handed over my passport, not from nerves about the interview, but because I hate flying. The agent scanned it, paused and again, then ran it through a third time. She looked up at me with this expression I'll never forget, half confusion, half alarm. Can you step aside, please? My stomach dropped. I watched other passengers move through security while I stood frozen by the metal detector. Two more agents appeared within seconds. One of them was older, maybe in his fifties. This stern face that made me want to cry. Ma'am, come with us. They pulled me into a small office behind the security checkpoint. White walls, two chairs, a desk with a computer. The door closed behind me with a heavy click. When did you last use this passport? Last summer I went to Greece with friends. Why? What's wrong? The older agent sat down across from me, holding his hands on the desk. This passport was reported lost in 2012 by a Diane Fletcher. That's you, correct? Yes. But I've never reported anything lost. I've had this passport since I was 16. I've used it multiple times. They Exchanged glances, the younger agent left the room without saying anything. I sat there for 20 minutes watching the clock, knowing I was about to miss my flight. My phone buzzed with text from the recruiter asking if I'd boarded yet. I couldn't answer. They'd taken my phone. Finally, the older agent returned with a stack of printed documents, spread them across the desk like he was revealing cards in a poker game. We need to ask you something. Do you know a woman named Patricia Fletcher? My blood went cold. That's my aunt, my mom's younger sister, the fun aunt who always brought expensive gifts to Christmas, who took me shopping for my prom dress. I've known my entire life. She's my aunt. Why? Patricia Fletcher reported this passport stolen in 2012, claiming it belonged to her. She's been using a replacement passport under your identity for over a decade. The room started spinning. I'm sorry, what? She's been travelling internationally under your name. We've tracked trips to Mexico, the Bahamas, England, France and Spain. She opened three credit cards in your name, took out a car loan, even got married in Nevada two years ago. I couldn't breathe. My Aunt Patricia, the one who babysat me every weekend when I was little, who came to every single birthday party, who my mom trusted more than anyone, she'd stolen my identity when I was 16 before I'd even use my passport. Once the agent slid a photo across the Table security.

That's why we have nothing. I stayed quiet, but when she filed for divorce, what the lawyer revealed made her collapse. Your father is weak. That's why we have nothing. My wife, Jennifer said it at dinner. Our 12 year old son, Tyler looked at me, waiting. I just cut my chicken and stayed silent. Jennifer had been saying things like this for months. Little digs, casual cruelty. Always in front of Tyler. Always designed to shrink me. I worked as a quality control manager. Decent salary, stable hours, good benefits. But Jennifer wanted more. She wanted the executive husband, the luxury cars, the Instagram lifestyle. What she got was me. A man who worked hard, came home tired, and believed in saving money instead of spending it. Her resentment grew like mold. It started small comments about my clothes, about how her friend's husbands took them on cruises, about how I had no ambition. Then it became pointed, especially in front of Tyler. Your dad doesn't have what it takes. Your dad settled for mediocre. Your dad is too scared to ask for a raise. I never fought back. Not because I was weak, but because I was protecting something she didn't know about. Six years earlier, my father passed away. He left me everything. A paid off rental property portfolio. Eight units across three states. Stocks, bonds, a safety deposit box with gold. And one instruction. Don't tell anyone. Until you're certain they love you for you, not for what you have. I never told Jennifer. When we married, I was 26, working entry level, driving a used Honda. She said she loved me for my kindness, for my stability. I wanted to believe her, so I kept the inheritance hidden, set up a separate trust, hired a property manager. Every month, rental income poured in. I reinvested it. The portfolio grew. By the time Jennifer called me weak at dinner, I was worth $2.3 million. But I still drove the Honda, still brought lunch from home, still lived like a quality control manager. Because I needed to know, would she love me if she thought I had nothing? The answer came three months later. Tyler ran into my home office, tears streaming down his face. Mom's talking to someone. She said she's done with you. She said you're dead weight. I found her in the bedroom, on the phone, laughing. No, he won't fight it. He's too passive. I'll get the house, child support, and I'm finally free to find someone worth my time. She didn't see me in the doorway. The divorce papers arrived one week later.

So I had my daughter about six weeks ago. She came out with this super light blonde hair and these pale blue eyes. I'm talking almost white blonde. My husband and I both have brown hair and brown eyes. The second the nurse handed her to him in the delivery room, I could see his face change. Got real quiet and just stared at her. We got home from the hospital, and that same night, he cornered me in the kitchen while I was trying to make toast because I hadn't eaten anything real in, like, two days. He straight up told me he wanted a paternity test. I was so tired, I could barely stand up. Still bleeding. Everything hurt. And he's asking me this? I tried explaining that babies can be born with lighter features that change over time. My mom was blonde until she was, like, 4. His own cousin was born with red hair that turned brown. He didn't want to hear it. He said if I didn't agree to the test, he'd file for divorce just like that. So I said, fine. Do whatever you need to do because I was too exhausted to fight about it. The next morning, he packed a bag and left to stay at his parents'place. Didn't even help me get the baby to her first pediatrician appointment or anything. Just gone. Three days after he left, his mom called me. She didn't even ask how I was doing or how her granddaughter was. She just launched into this whole speech about how if the test came back and the baby wasn't his, she'd make sure I got nothing in the divorce. She used the phrase taken to the cleaners, like, three times. I. I was sitting there holding my daughter who wouldn't stop crying, and I just hung up on her. My sister moved in to help me. Those first few weeks, she was the one getting up with me at night, making sure I ate, doing the laundry. My husband called once to ask when the test results would be ready. That was it. One phone call in three weeks. The results finally came back yesterday. The lab called me in the morning and said we could pick them up afternoon. I texted my husband, and he showed up around 2. He didn't bring anything for the baby, didn't ask how she was doing. Just.

But I have one condition, too. His fork stopped halfway to his mouth. Excuse me. If I'm signing a prenup protecting her money, she should sign one protecting mine. Richard actually laughed. Protecting your money. You're a teacher, right? So it should be easy to agree to. This is absurd. I pulled out my phone, opened my investment account, turn the screen toward him, balance, $827. Richard's face went blank. He grabbed reading glasses from his pocket, looked closer. This is a joke. No joke. That's my Vanguard account. I have another $43,000 in savings. Total around 890,000.

And my last straw was when she left our nine year old stranded at practice. I'm 36 and my wife's 37. We've been married for 12 years and we've always split housework evenly. I handle the lawn dishes and laundry. She meal plans, cooks and does all the school pickups and drop offs for our two kids. About three months ago, she discovered this Roblox game called dress to impress. If you're not familiar, it's basically a fashion competition where you dress up a character based on themes and other players rate your outfit. Sounds innocent enough, right? At first it was harmless. She play for maybe 20 minutes before bed, laughing at the ridiculous outfits. I thought it was cute that she had a little hobby to unwind with. But then I started noticing changes. Dinner, which used to be ready by six PM, was suddenly being served at 7:30. When I'd ask about it, she'd say she lost track of time. Then laundry started piling up, stuff I needed for work. She'd apologize and promise to get to it but then forget again. Our 11 year old daughter came to me one day and said, dad, can you sign my permission slip? I asked mom three times and she keeps forgetting I signed it. But I was getting concerned. I tried talking to her gently. Hey, I noticed You've been playing that game a lot. Is everything okay? She brush it off saying she just needed a mental break. Fair enough, I thought. But it kept getting worse. She missed her dentist appointment because she was in the middle of a round. She forgot to grocery shop so we ordered pizza three nights straight. Our son mentioned she'd been late picking him up from school twice that week. Last night was the breaking point. I had to work late. An emergency at the office kept me until almost seven PM our nine year old son Oliver had basketball practice that ended at six. My wife was supposed to pick him up. Oliver doesn't have a phone yet. I got home around 7, exhausted. I called out for Oliver. Nothing. I checked his room, the kitchen, everywhere. My heart started racing. Where was my son? I walked to our bedroom and there she was sitting cross legged on the bed, iPad propped up, completely absorbed in the game. She was adjusting a sparkly pink dress on her character, tongue sticking out in concentration. Where's Oliver? I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. She looked up and I watched her face drain of color. Her mouth opened but no sound came out. Then her eyes filled with tears. Oh my god, I forgot basketball practice had ended over an hour ago. Oliver had called her phone seven times. He texted, mom, where are you? And.

I lost most of the deposits, but I didn't care anymore. I didn't tell anyone. Not Ava, not the wedding planner. I just let the cancellation emails sit in their inboxes. Scheduled to go out the morning of the wedding. The day of the wedding, I blocked her number. The venue turned away the decorators when they arrived. Security stopped the caterers at the gate. When the wedding planner called, asking about final payment, I told them to talk to Ava. She showed up at the venue in her dress with 80 guests behind her. Security wouldn't let her in. She screamed, she fought. Her fiance had to physically restrain her to avoid an arrest. She tried calling me 47 times. I didn't answer. She drove to my house. I'd already told the gate guard not to let her in. My parents were furious at first. They said, no matter how badly your kids treat you, you don't retaliate like this. So I told them what she done. They offered to pay for a new wedding. Ava told them to get out of her house and never come back. That changed their minds. Ten days later, my parents visited her. She still wasn't married. No new wedding planned. She burned Through every friend who might have helped her scramble together a backup ceremony. A few months after that, her fiance Matt, called me. They'd separated. He said Ava had anger issues he couldn't handle anymore. He apologized for not standing up to her when she mistreated me. I told him it wasn't his fault. He asked if I'd help her get therapy. I tried. I went to her apartment to offer support. She screamed at me for 20 minutes, then threw me out. Ava's childhood friend, the only person she'd never fought with, eventually convinced her to go to therapy. She went. A few months later. She apologized to my parents, but she told them she'd never forgive me. I don't feel guilty anymore. I did more than enough. If she wants to hate me for the rest of her life, that's her choice. But I'm done being punished for care.

He said something happened to the mom in the last couple weeks and he was leaving right then to go pick her up. Just like that. No warning, no discussion, nothing. I was standing there with a butter knife in my hand trying to process what he just said. When my daughter came running into the kitchen crying. She said dad told her she had to share her room and all her stuff with some girl she didn't even know. She was sobbing, asking me why, and I didn't have an answer because I was too busy trying not to throw up. I grabbed my phone and called my parents. My mom picked up on the second ring and I just said, we need the guest room and I'll explain later. They said yes immediately. Then I went upstairs with my daughter and we started packing everything. Her clothes, her books, stuffed animals she's had since she was a baby, her art supplies, her posters, her bedding, all of it. She kept asking me questions I couldn't answer. And I just kept folding clothes and putting them in boxes. My son heard the commotion and Came in asking what was happening. I told him his dad had a kid with another woman and she was moving in. He just stood there staring at me like I was speaking another language. Then he asked if he had to share his room, too. I told him no. I told him we were going to make sure of it. Monday morning, my parents showed up with my sister, her husband, and my two nephews. We had a whole moving crew. We took every single thing that belonged to my daughter out of that house. Her desk, her bookshelf, her bean bag, chair, even the little lamp on her nightstand. We cleared out her entire room and left it completely empty. Not even a hanger in the closet. Then we put locks on my bedroom door and my son's bedroom door. Heavy duty ones. The kind you need a key for. My dad installed them himself and gave me both sets of keys. We moved all my husband's

But then I found out all of my friends knew and were laughing behind my back. So I acted like I didn't know and threw this bombshell at his wedding. I've been with Sarah for eight years, my best friend Marcus for 15. When he asked me to be his best man, I was honored. I spent weeks planning his bachelor party, writing the perfect speech, making sure everything was flawless for his big day. Wedding was at this gorgeous Vineyard outside the city. I arrived early to help set up and that's when I saw them, Sarah and Marcus in the wine cellar pressed against the oak barrels, his hands in her hair, her dress already half unzipped. I stood frozen at the doorway, phone in hand to text Marcus about the florist. They didn't see me. I backed away slowly, my heart hammering so hard I thought it would break through my chest. I heard the laughter coming from the groomsman suite. Jake's voice carried down the hallway. Man, I can't believe he still doesn't know. How long has it been now, 6, 7 months? Brandon laughed. Dude, so oblivious. Remember last month when they disappeared at his birthday party? We covered for them. The whole group erupted in laughter. My entire friend group, every single one of them knew and had been lying to my face for months. Something cold settled over Me, not anger yet, just this crystal clear calm. I walked back to my car, sat there for 20 minutes thinking. Then I smiled because I had the microphone tonight. I had the toast and I had receipts. The ceremony was beautiful. Sarah sat in the third row, dabbing her eyes like she was moved. Marcus stood at the altar looking confident, happy, completely unaware. I stood beside him holding the rings, playing my part perfectly. At the reception. I worked the room, smiled at everyone, hugged Sarah, told Marcus his bride looked stunning. Jake clapped me on the back. You good man. You seem off. Never better, I said. Just emotional about the speech. Dinner service wrapped up. The DJ announced the best man's toast. I stood, tapped my glass and the room went silent. I could see Sarah's face slightly nervous. Marcus grinned at me, completely trusting. I want to start by saying what an honor it is to stand here tonight. I began warmly. Marcus and I have been best friends since middle school. We've been through everything.

His face went completely pale. His mouth dropped open a little, and his eyes got huge. He looked like someone told him his car got totaled or something. Just frozen there, holding this paper that proved I've been telling the truth the whole time. I couldn't help it. I started laughing. Not even a mean laugh at first. Just this burst of tired, relieved laughter. And then I said it. I told you so. He snapped his head toward me and his whole face changed. He started yelling about how I was being cruel and mocking him during a difficult time. A difficult time for him. I just spent three weeks alone with a Newborn, recovering from giving birth, while he got to sleep through the night at his mommy's house. But sure, this was hard for him. My sister heard him yelling from upstairs, where she was putting the baby down for a nap. She came down and just stood there in the doorway with her arms crossed. He shut up real quick and grabbed his keys that he needed to clear his head, and left again. Didn't even look at his daughter. Two hours later, his mom called. She laid into me about how disrespectful I was for laughing. At him. How he was going through something traumatic and I made it worse. She said I humiliated him and that I should be apologizing. I told her that maybe if she raised a son who trusted his wife, we wouldn't be in this situation. She hung up on me. She's been texting me since yesterday. This morning, I woke up to four messages about how I'm a terrible wife and how hurt my husband is. One of them said, I clearly don't understand what it's like to have doubts, because I'm not the one who has to wonder if the baby is mine. I wanted to throw my phone

I woke up in a hospital bed after 8 weeks and the first words out of my brother's mouth were, we had to put Cooper down. I'm sorry. He wouldn't eat. Bet said it was kinder this way. Cooper was my six year old golden retriever. I'd raised him from a puppy. He slept at the foot of my bed every single night. When I tried to speak, nothing came out except his choking sound. My brother patted my shoulder and said it's okay. We got the kids a new puppy, a Labrador. They named him Buddy. They were talking about replacing my dog like he was a broken appliance. My name is Tim, short for Timothy. And before the accident I was a software engineer living alone with Cooper in Denver. The accident happened when a delivery truck ran a red light and t boned my car at 50 miles per hour. The impact threw me into a concrete barrier and I sustained severe head trauma that require wired emergency surgery. I've been in a medically induced coma for three weeks and then in a minimally conscious state for another five weeks. During that entire time, I could hear everything happening around me, but my body wouldn't respond. I couldn't move or speak or signal that I was conscious and understanding every word. What my family didn't know was that my brain was recording every conversation With perfect clarity, I have this thing where I remember details really well, always have. After the head injury, that ability got even stronger. Every word spoken near my hospital bed got stored in my mind with exact decision. My mom visited during the first month, talking about medical bills piling up. She mentioned Cooper a few times, saying my brother was taking care of him. Then around Week 4, her tone changed. She stopped mentioning Cooper. Instead, she talked about how my brother's kids wanted a puppy and how expensive Cooper's food and vet bills were. She said we might need to make some practical decisions about the dog. My brother visited less, but when he did, he talked to my mom in the hallway. I could hear every word he said. Cooper was getting depressed, wouldn't eat much, just sat by the front door waiting. My mom said we can't keep spending money on a dog when your kids want one and Tim might not even wake up. She said maybe it would be kind.

I paid for Ava. My 27 year old daughter forbid me from attending her wedding. The wedding I was financing. $40,000. Venue, caterers, flowers, photographer, everything. I only found out by accident. I called the wedding planner three days before to add my brother to the guest list. He said the list was full. Something felt off. So I pushed harder. I told him I was paying for everything and needed to see the list. He sent it over, reluctantly. My name wasn't on it. Neither was my wife. Mercy's called him back. There must be a mistake. No mistake, he said quietly. Then he forwarded me the email chain between him and Ava. She'd explicitly instructed him to keep us off the list. More than that, she told venue security to physically prevent us from entering. The worst part, she listed her estranged mother, who abandoned her at seven, as a guest. The woman who chose Europe over her daughter got an invitation. I didn't. I tried calling Ava. Voicemail. I left a message asking her to call me back. She didn't. Not that day, not the next. So I drove to her apartment the morning before the wedding. I'm too busy to meet, she said through the cracked door. I have a wedding to prepare for. Why am I not invited to the wedding I'm paying for? I asked. She opened the door wider. Looked me dead in the eye and said, and good for you for figuring it out. Saved you the drive to the venue. No explanation, no apology. Just cold indifference. I started crying right there in her doorway. What did I do to deserve this? You've always chosen everyone else over me. She snapped. You married that woman and shoved her in my face. You sided with your sister's brat when I was just defending myself. You embarrassed me at school! You ruined my entire childhood! I reminded her that I defended her when she was caught with drugs. I pulled strings to get her into college. I supported her financially until she was 26. You owed me all of that, she said, you don't get credit for basic parenting. Then she told me to leave before I created more drama in her home. When I got back, I told my wife mercy everything she'd been paid.

We've been living together for six months and I thought I had the morning routine down. Wake up at 7, start the coffee maker, hand her a cup when she stumbled out of bed. Simple. She always said she loved it. Then about three weeks ago, everything changed. Came into the kitchen while I was pouring and said, wait, did you measure the grounds? I looked at her confused. I've been making coffee the same way for months. I just use the scoop, I told her. She shook her head. We should be using exactly 18 grams. I read this article about optimal extraction. The next morning she bought a kitchen scale. The morning after that, she stood next to me while I made coffee and watched me measure. 17.9 grams. Add a little more. I added a pinch. Now it's 18.3. That's too much. By the end of the week, there was a whole system. Prewarm the mug in the microwave for exactly 30 seconds at 25, not 35. Heat the milk to 140 degrees, no hotter or it scalds. Pour in a circular motion. She even showed me YouTube videos about proper pouring technique. Every morning turned into an interrogation. I'd hand her the cup and she'd ask, did you warm the mug? Yeah. For how long? 30 seconds. Did you check with the timer or just guess? I counted in my head. She'd sigh like I told her I'd run over her cat on Tuesday. I made the coffee while she was in the shower. I thought I did everything right, weighed the grounds twice to make sure, warmed the mug, used the thermometer for the milk. When she came out, I handed it to her proudly. She took one sip and her face scrunched up. This tastes different. I followed all the steps. I said, did you use whole milk or 2%? I froze, uh, 2%. That's what we always use. I bought whole milk yesterday specifically for coffee. It makes the texture better. I opened the fridge. There was whole milk in the back. I didn't see it. I admitted. She poured the entire cup down the sink right in front of me and started making a new one herself. While she did it, she kept talking about how I never pay attention to details and how it's not that hard to just follow instructions. That's when I.

So I'm 6 foot 6. My husband is 5 7. When we got married three years ago, we had to figure out how our kitchen would work because his whole family is short and I'm basically a giant. We tried it their way for like two weeks where everything was at normal height and I was crouching constantly to grab plates and pans. My back was killing me. So we moved everything up higher and got him a step stool. Problem solved. He didn't care. I wasn't in pain anymore and we moved on with our lives. Then my mother in law's roof started leaking two weeks ago. Big leak, needs serious repairs and she needed a place to stay. My husband and I have a spare bedroom. His sister, who's also my best friend, she lives in a one bedroom apartment. So obviously she came to stay with us. Day 1, I noticed my spice rack was lower. I didn't say anything because maybe I moved it and forgot. Day 2, the plates were on a lower shelf. I asked my husband if he moved them and he said no. 3, I watched her move my drinking glasses down while I was getting the mail. I came back inside and she was putting them in a cabinet that was basically at her chest level. For me, that's knee level. I asked Her why she moved them. And she said it was ridiculous to keep things so high up when guests might need them. I told her we don't really have guests and that I need things where they are. She did this little laugh and said she just been trying to help make the kitchen make more sense. My husband talked to her that night. He told her to stop moving stuff around. She cried a little and said she felt like we were being unwelcome. He said that wasn't it, but the kitchen was set up for us and she needed to leave it alone. She agreed. Next morning, the mugs were moved. I opened the cabinet where we keep them and they weren't there. I checked three other cabinets before I found them in the cabinet under the counter, the one where we used to keep pots. Before we moved those up, too. I had to get on my knees on the kitchen floor for, to pull out a mug. My back hurt immediately, that sharp pain you get when you bend wrong. I made my coffee and didn't say anything because my husband had already left for work. That afternoon. She moved the cereal boxes, then the mixing bowls. I watched her do it while I was on a work call in the living room. She saw me looking and just smiled and kept going. When my husband got home, I told him he talked to her again. She said the step stool was right there and she didn't see why she should have to use it in her son's house. He told her it was our house.

Missus Kowalski walked over, looked down at this disaster of a human being on her lawn and started laughing so hard she had to sit down on the grass. She was crying, laughing, couldn't breathe, just pointing at him and wheezing. The burglar tried to say something, but his mouth was full of watermelon, so it came out as mmm, mmm, legal mmm. Someone yelled that we should call the police, and I pulled out my phone. But before I could even unlock it, my girlfriend, Natasha, came running out of my house holding the biggest roll of plastic wrap I'd ever seen, the industrial kind we bought for covering food at the party. She had this absolutely manic look in her eyes and yelled, cure the suspect, like she was in a cop show. Before anyone could process what was happening, she started wrapping the burglar's legs together while he was still lying there covered in charcoal and fruit. She wrapped around and around and around, and the burglar was too shocked and winded to even fight back. He just kept saying, wait, what? What is this? What's happening? In this confused, defeated voice, Derek immediately understood the assignment and started wrapping the guy's arms to his torso. Then Felix found another roll of plastic wrap in my kitchen and They just kept going. Within three minutes, this burglar looked like a human burrito, just his head sticking out, completely immobilized, covered in black dust and watermelon chunks, lying on Mrs. Kowalski's lawn while 20 drunk people stood around watching like this was normal. But then it got weirder because Gavin suggested we take him to the front yard to wait for police. And six guys just picked him up like a log and carried him. The burglar was screaming the whole way, yelling about his rights and lawyers and illegal detention. But Gavin just kept spatula tapping his head saying, shh, you're under citizens arrest. Very legal, very cool. They propped him up against my fence like a decoration. And that's when things got out of control. Full story is linked below or on my channel.

My husband talked to her that night. He told her to stop moving stuff around. She cried a little and said she felt like we were being unwelcoming. He said that wasn't it, but the kitchen was set up for us and she needed to leave it alone. She agreed. Next morning, the mugs were moved. I opened the cabinet where we keep them, and they weren't there. I checked three other cabinets before I found them in the cabinet under the counter. The one where we used to keep pots before we moved those up, too. Had to get on my knees on the kitchen floor to pull out a mug. My back hurt immediately, that sharp pain you get when you bend wrong. I made my coffee and didn't say anything because my husband had already left for work. That afternoon. She moved the cereal boxes, then the mixing bowls. I watched her do it while I was on a work call in the living room. She saw me looking and just smiled and kept going. When my husband got home, I told him he talked to her again. She said the step stool was right there and she didn't see why she should have to use it in her son's house. He told her it was our house, not just his, and she needed to stop. She went quiet and didn't move anything for two days. Then this morning, I went To make coffee. And the mugs were gone again. Not in the upper cabinet, not in the cabinet under the counter where she'd put them before. I checked every single cabinet in my kitchen. It took me five minutes to find them. In the cabinet above the fridge, pushed all the way to the back, which makes no sense, because that's even higher than where we had them originally. I pulled one out and my back spasmed. I was done. She came into the kitchen and started making herself toast. I turned around and said if she couldn't stop rearranging my kitchen, she could get a hotel room. She froze. Then she started going on about how she was just trying to make things make more sense. How this was her son's home, too, and it was just a little reorganization, and we shouldn't all suffer just because I'm tall. Then she said I was heartless for expecting her to stay in a hotel during the holidays. My husband came in because he heard her voice getting louder. He looked uncomfortable, but he backed me up. He told her this was my home, too, and if she wouldn't respect that, she'd have to leave. She went into the guest room, and I could hear her crying through the door. My husband stood in the kitchen looking stressed. He didn't say I was wrong, but I could tell he hated this. She's still in there.

I took an Ancestry DNA test for fun and discovered I wasn't related to my parents at all, zero genetic match. But my DNA showed I had a biological family in Oregon, parents, siblings, grandparents, all alive and looking for me. When I confronted my parents in their mansion in Connecticut, they didn't deny it. They admitted they adopted me through a private attorney when I was 6 months old. Except there was no option. They bought me. My mother, Layla, sat calmly at the breakfast table. You will not contact these people. You will not pursue this further. We raised you. We paid for everything. And you will not embarrass this family. My father, Blake, was more direct. We've donated millions to every hospital, university and psychiatric facility in this state. One word from you about this and we'll have you committed so fast your head will spin. Who do you think they'll believe? A respected family or a mentally unstable young woman? I had no money of my own, no job outside their company, no friends they hadn't approved. They controlled everything. But I had the DNA results and the names of my real family. I contacted my biological mother secretly using a burner phone. Her name was Teresa and she'd been searching for me for 26 years. She told me I'd been taken from the hospital nursery. When I was 3 days old, the hospital told her I died from complications. They even held a funeral with a closed casket. She'd been living with that grief my entire life. We plan to meet in two weeks so she could see that I was alive. Three days later, Teresa and her husband died in a gas leak at their home. The news called it a tragic accident, but the timing was too perfect. I tried going to a lawyer outside my parents circle. Within 24 hours, he called and refused my case. He warned me the family I was accusing was very powerful and I should stop making false claims. I had a biological sister named Amy who'd been 7 years old when I was. I found her on social media and sent her a message explaining everything. She blocked me immediately, then sent one message back, my parents died because of you. Leave me alone. My parents had gotten to her first. I told her I was a scam artist trying to exploit her grief. I tried to leave Connecticut with what little cash I had. My credit cards declined, my bank account frozen. My parents claimed I'd had a mental health crisis and needed Protection. I stayed with my college roommate. But that night, my parents lawyers arrived with a court order. I needed a psychiatric evaluation at a private facility they funded. I had 48 hours before they'd commit me. Once inside that place, they Could keep me there indefinitely. Declare me.

Don't move. I need to call someone. What's wrong? Just please wait. Twenty minutes later, the door burst open. Three men in expensive suits stormed in. The lead guy was maybe 65, silver hair, charcoal suit that cost more than my car used to. He walked straight to me and just stared. After 32 years, he whispered, we finally found you. The man's name was Richard Thornton, CEO of Thornton Pharmaceuticals. They took me to a back office, all dark wood and leather chairs. Mister Williams, Richard said, what we discovered in your blood is miraculous. I'm dying. I said, what? No. He laughed. You have a genetic mutation, so.

It wasn't until my 7th birthday that I knew something was wrong with me. I was always in some type of pain or another. When I would tell my mom, she would say, it must be a cold. Go sleep it off. Sleeping it off never worked. Take some Tylenol. Only ease the pain enough to function. Why won't you take me to the doctors? I sobbed in absolute agony. You're faking it, so there's no reason to. My mom would always respond that way every time I asked. It left me feeling like I was insane, that the pain was all mental, coming out as physical symptoms. I never questioned her. When I hit my teens, it would only end in a screaming match that took almost everything out of me. I would sob in my room as my younger sister tried to ease my twitching muscles. This isn't normal, Maya would say. It hurts so bad. But when she was done with the massage, it did always. I feel better. My head drops. Thank you, Maya. It would become a ritual. After school and before bed, Maya would massage my muscles to keep them from locking up, twitching or stain at random times. It hurts so bad, I muttered as I made Maya and myself some lunch. Why are you so overdramatic? My mom asked as she heard me. Because it Feels like I am a pulled wire and one more twist and my whole body falls apart. Quit faking it. God, why can't I have a normal kid? I gaped at my mom. Mom, Maya is extremely talented in school for her age. That doesn't make her not normal. My mom rolls her eyes. My, the excellent and you the lazy liar. I grit my teeth. What the heck, mom, I say before turning around and making my way to Maya. Maya has tears flowing down her face as I give her a hug. You are brilliant and don't let anyone tell you differently. She squeezes my hand back. You are not lazy and I believe you. A glint enters my eyes. Go watch the door. Maya does as I ask, and I finally call a doctor on my behalf. It did help that I was 17 and could schedule a doctor's appointment on my own. I didn't need a parent either. The appointment was set for this coming Friday. Maya just looks at me and nods for you. Friday came and I still felt like I was an imposter that was about to waste a doctor's time. I drive up to the doctors and park. My hands are shaking and my mind can only hear my mom's voice saying, you're faking it. I take a deep breath to try and calm my nerves before I push open the door. The receptionist gives me the paperwork to fill out, which Was easy before I was placed into a waiting room. The doctor finally comes in. You have been in constant pain since you were 7? Yes. Every day I've noticed stress makes it worse. Also if I don't get enough sleep. I watch closely to make sure he doesn't think I was lying. Why haven't you gotten a diagnosis or treatment for this in the past? I swallowed a lump in my throat. My mom told me I was faking. A tear rolls down.

I was locking up my office at midnight when I heard footsteps running behind me. I turned around. A pregnant woman was sprinting toward me. Huge stomach, crying hard. She looked like she was about to collapse. Please, she grabbed my arm. Please. You're a lawyer, right? I saw the sign. I need help, ma'am. It's midnight. Call my office tomorrow. My trial is tomorrow morning. She was sobbing. I'm eight and a/2 months pregnant. They want me to go to prison. They'll take my baby away forever. I stopped. What's the charge? Armed robbery. I stole baby formula and diapers from a store. I'm homeless. I had a gun. I was desperate. She could barely breathe. My public defender says I should plead guilty. Three years in prison. But if I go to prison, I will lose my baby. He's the only thing I have to live for. I looked at her stomach, then at my watch. The trial was in nine hours. What's your name? Nadia Reeves. Come inside. We need to talk. We spent all night in my office where Nadia told me everything. I read her case file and saw the security footage showing everything. This looked like a certain loss, but I couldn't just let a pregnant woman lose her child. I'll represent you. Trial starts at 9:00am. Get some sleep. The next morning we walked into the courthouse together. Nadia could barely walk. Her stomach was Huge. She looked terrified. The prosecutor saw us coming and smiled like he'd already won. The trial started. The prosecutor played the security footage first. Clear as day, Nadia pointing a loaded gun at the store clerk's face, taking money and baby supply. The jury watched in silence, already deciding she was guilty. Then the store clerk testified. He was shaking. She put the gun against my forehead right here. He pointed. She said, give me everything or I'll shoot. I thought she was going to kill me. I stood up fast. Your honor, my client was desperate. She was homeless and pregnant. Executor cut me off. Motive doesn't matter, your honor. A crime is a crime. Judge Brenner agreed. Overruled. Sit down, counselor. I tried again. I wanted to show the jury the full extent of Nadia's situation, how she had no money, how she was living in her car, how they would have done the same in her shoes. But the prosecutor stood up. He was smirking. Now, desperation doesn't excuse armed robbery, your honor. If it did, we have to let half the criminals in the city go free. Three jurors nodded. I was losing. Then the prosecutor dropped his bomb. He showed Nadia's internet history. Three days before the robbery, she'd searched pawn shops, store hours, how much baby items sell for. This proves she planned it, the prosecutor said. This wasn't desperation. This was a.

You're not taking him anywhere, you pervert. Ryan grabs my leg and I can feel him shaking, as you can see. I say, trying to stay calm. He's standing close to me because he trusts me. You're scaring him. So how about you back off? No, she insists. Scared because of you. He just doesn't know how to express it yet. Then she looks down at Ryan, her voice suddenly sweet. Come on now, sweetie. I'm here to rescue you. Come with me. Ryan presses harder against my leg. No, that's my daddy. I thought that would end it. It didn't. She reaches down, grabs Ryan by the arm and starts running toward the exit. Ryan starts screaming loud, terrified screams. Daddy, daddy. For two seconds, I'm frozen. I genuinely cannot process what's actually happening. This woman just grabbed my son and is running through the store with him. Then reality snaps back. I take off running, yelling at the top of my lungs, stop, stop her. She's kidnapping my son. Someone stop her. People turn and stare, but most just freeze. One worker near the front finally processes what's happening and steps in front of her before she Reaches the automatic doors. Ma'am, stop, he says, holding up his hands. Why are you stopping me? She demands, still holding Ryan's arm. This man is trying to kidnap this child. Ryan is sobbing now, reaching for me. I grab him and pull him into my arms. You're okay, buddy. I've got you. The store manager appears along with two other employees. We've called the police, the manager says everyone needs to stay calm. The lady is indignant. He's kidnapping this boy. Look at them. He's white. And that man is clearly not his father. I'm his father, I say, my voice shaking. And you just tried to abduct my son. The police arrived six minutes later. She kept insisting she was saving him, that it was obvious I wasn't his father. I showed them my ID, pulled up my phone, photos of Ryan's fourth birthday party, his first day of preschool, videos of him calling me daddy, a text thread with my wife from that morning confirming the grocery list. Her face went from righteous to pale in about 10 seconds. The officer asked if I wanted to press charges. Absolutely, I said. She was arrested for attempted kidnapping. Ryan's fine now, shaken up, but fine. My wife was horrified when I told her, but I pressed charges and I don't regret it for a second.

The jury went to decide. They came back in 20 minutes. That's the fastest I've ever seen. Nadia was doubled over in pain next to me. She knew we'd lost. Judge Brenner walked in.

She grabbed her stomach and fell backward. Her chair crashed to the floor. I'm giving birth! She screamed. The prosecutor jumped up. Your honor, she's faking. She's trying to manipulate the jury. But Nadia's water had already exploded everywhere. Gallons all over the floor. She was crying and gasping. The prosecutor went completely still. All the color drained from his face. Get an ambulance! Judge Brenner screamed. Paramedics burst in 10 minutes later. While I held her hand, they loaded Nadia onto a stretcher. She was screaming now, in pain, terrified. She grabbed my jacket. You're the only one who showed me kindness. Please don't leave me. I climbed into the ambulance. With her. I'm not leaving you. The door slammed shut, sirens blaring. We raced toward the hospital. Nadia was squeezing my hand so hard, I thought my bones would break. She was having contractions every minute. I'm scared, she cried. What happens to my baby? We're getting you help. Just breathe. I coached her using techniques I'd Learned from my wife's delivery. We pulled up to the emergency entrance. I started helping the paramedics rush her inside. That's when I saw them. The prosecutor and six federal agents in suits right behind us. Stop! The lead agent cut in front of us and blocked the hospital doors. Nadia Reeves needs to be handcuffed to the bed before she gives birth. She's a convicted felon. Are you heartless or just stupid? I yelled, tried to shove past him. The six agents instantly grabbed my shoulders and held me back. The prosecutor stepped forward. She's getting cuffed to the bed, and when she gives birth, we're taking that baby and sending her to prison. I looked back at Nadia on the stretcher, crying in pain and frustration.

I demanded to know what Eric had said that was so unforgivable. My sister wouldn't invite my husband to her wedding. Finally, my mom caved and told me. At Christmas dinner last year, my uncle made some joke about Luke being totally whipped by Alex, just typical guy banter. Eric had laughed and said something like, yeah, Luke's definitely punching above his weight with Alex. My entire family sitting at that table heard it as Eric calling my sister ugly. They've been holding on to this for eight entire months. Nobody said a single word to us about it. They just quietly decided Eric wasn't welcome anymore and iced him out of family events. When, when I got home that night, I asked Eric about it directly. His face went pale. He genuinely didn't remember saying it, probably because it had seemed so insignificant at the time. When I explained how everyone interpreted it, he looked absolutely horrified. I meant Luke was lucky, Eric said. Like, how did Luke land someone as amazing as Alex wasn't calling her unattractive. I was saying Luke scored someone totally out of his league. But my family never asked for clarification. They just assumed the worst and froze him out. I called Alex immediately. She actually picked up this time and I laid everything out, told her exactly what Eric had meant, how it was supposed to be a compliment that got twisted. There was this painfully long silence on. Then Alex said coldly, that's not what it sounded like to me. I completely lost it. Told her that eight months of silent treatment over a misunderstood comment was absolutely ridiculous, that she could have just asked us about it at any point, that she was willing to exclude my husband from her wedding over something she never even verified. She got defensive, said I was making excuses for him, said if he really meant it as a compliment, he would have clarified it right there. We haven't spoken since that call three days ago. Eric's devastated. He wrote Alex a detailed apology letter explaining what he actually meant, but I don't know if she'll even read it. My mom keeps texting saying I'm overreacting and that I should just come to the wedding alone to keep a peace. But how am I supposed to celebrate my sister's marriage when she can't even give my husband the benefit of the doubt?

Been confused for every race you can imagine over my 29 years. My wife's white and her son Ryan calls me dad. His biological father is not in the picture. And honestly, I've been raising him since he was 1. He's 4 now and he's mine in every way that matters. Last Tuesday, my wife needed groceries and had a bunch of errands to run. I work nights at a warehouse, so I'm usually asleep during the day, but I happened to be awake, so I offered to go. She works hard, does everything around the house, so I figured she deserved a break. I took Ryan with me. He was excited, kept asking if we could get the part with the race car attached to the front. We knocked out the errands. First, post office, dry cleaners, and Ryan was perfect the whole time, chattering away about his day at preschool. Then we hit the grocery store for the final stop. Ryan was full of energy by then, running a few feet ahead of me, laughing, saying hi to everyone we passed. I don't mind it as long as he stays where I can see him and doesn't crash. Into anyone. We're in the canned goods aisle. I'm looking for cream corn. My wife's specific about the brand. When Ryan jogs to the end of the aisle, an older lady, maybe 65, is entering from the other side. Ryan, being the social butterfly he is, runs right up to her. Hi, me 4 me, Ryan, he announces, grinning ear to ear. The lady looks down and smiles, well, hello there. You're a sweet boy, but you shouldn't be running around unattended. Let's go find your parents. I didn't think anything of it. She probably just hadn't seen me yet. Ryan, come back here, bud, please, I call out. You run back toward me and starts spinning in circles because, you know, he's 4. I'm still scanning the shelves when the lady walks past me. She stops right behind me. Again, I think nothing of it. It's a grocery store. People need to get around. I turn my cart toward the front register. She immediately blocks my path. Excuse me, I say politely, trying to go around her. She moves her cart directly in front of me again. I thought maybe she was confused or didn't hear me. Excuse me. I repeat, attempting to go around the other side. She blocks me a third time. Now I'm getting irritated, ma'am. I need to get by. She crosses her arms. I don't think so. You're not going anywhere with that child. I blink at her. What are you talking about? He's My son. Her face hardens. That's not your child. He's white. You're Mexican. You probably didn't.

My brother said I was being dramatic. My uncle said, family doesn't test family. My parents said they raised me better. But my girlfriend grabbed my hand and said, you needed to know the truth.

How is it different? Explain exactly how my accidents are different from yours. Because mine actually were accidents. Prove it. I don't have to prove anything. You either trust me or you don't. Funny how that only applies to your accidents. The real kicker came two weeks later. I ran into Kayla at target. Recognized her from The excessive Instagram stalking I've been doing. You're Ryan's wife, she said, looking uncomfortable. I am. Look, this is awkward. But could you tell him to stop? The texts, the comments. Christopher's getting upset. He said they were accents. She laughed, not kindly. Right? Like the accident where he asked if I ever thought about what could have been. Or the accident where he said he drove past our old apartment and got emotional. My chest went cold. He said that three weeks ago at 1:00am, very accidentally, I'm sure. I went home and packed a bag. Ryan found me in the bedroom. Where are you going? My sister's accidentally meant to go to the grocery store, but muscle memory took me to her house instead. That doesn't make sense. Neither does accidentally asking your ex about what could have been. Face went white. You talked to Kayla, accidentally ran into her. Funny how accidents happen. Let me explain. No need. I'm sure your next wife will find your accidents charming. Next wife, we can work through this. We could have 3 months ago, but you chose to keep having accidents instead. I left him standing there, probably already composing his next accidental text to Kayla about how his marriage accidentally ended.

I pretended to get arrested to see who would bail me out. Three months ago, I got the idea after watching my cousin get locked up for a bar fight and his parents had him out in under an hour. Meanwhile, I've been the family ATM for years, covering my sister's car payment four months straight, putting down 12,000 for my brother's condo and lending my uncle eight grand for his landscaping business. So when I needed help moving last September from a third floor walk up, nobody could make it. My sister had brunch, my brother had work, my uncle's back hurt. So I started planning my revenge. I called my buddy who works at the precinct and he agreed to stage a fake arrest at our family barbecue last Sunday. He showed up in uniform with a patrol car, read me my rights in front of everyone and cuffed me next to the grill where my dad was cooking burgers. The charge was destruction of property at a local business and bail was set at $5,000, which I'd casually mentioned the week before at dinner that I had sitting in my savings account from my work bonus. My sister was the first person to react. She pulled out her phone immediately and started recording vertical video for social media. This is going straight to TikTok, she said, actually laughing out loud like it was the funniest Thing she'd ever witnessed. My brother walked inside the house to grab another beer from the fridge. Absolutely nothing was happening. Didn't even bother to ask what I supposedly destroyed or if I was okay. My uncle, the exact one whose entire landscaping business I funded with my own money, said, well, you shouldn't have broken the law, buddy, and casually flipped his burger on the grill. My mom was more worried about what the neighbours would think. She told me I'd embarrassed the whole family in front of everyone on the street. My dad said, this is exactly what happens when you don't think before acting. He refused to even look at me, just kept grilling like I wasn't being arrested 10 feet away from him. Then about five minutes later, my girlfriend pulled up in her car. She wasn't even invited to the barbecue. Someone from my family had texted her about what was happening. And she drove straight over, still wearing her work scrubs from her hospital shift. She came running up to the patrol car with this panicked look on her face asking if I was okay, what happened? Are you hurt? How much is the bail? And when my buddy who was playing the officer said.

I was locking up my office at midnight when I heard footsteps running behind me. I turned around. A pregnant woman was sprinting toward me. Huge stomach, crying hard. She looked like she was about to collapse. Please, she grabbed my arm. Please. You're a lawyer, right? I saw the sign. I need help, ma'am. It's midnight. Call my office tomorrow. My trial is tomorrow morning. She was sobbing. I'm eight and a/2 months pregnant. They want me to go to prison. They'll take my baby away forever. I stopped. What's the charge? Armed robbery. I stole baby formula and diapers from a store. I'm homeless. I had a gun. I was desperate. She could barely breathe. My public defender says I should plead guilty. Three years in prison. But if I go to prison, I will lose my baby. He's the only thing I have to live for. I looked at her stomach, then at my watch. The trial was in nine hours. What's your name? Nadia Reeves. Come inside. We need to talk. We spent all night in my office where Nadia told me everything, read her case file and saw the security footage showing everything. This looked like a certain loss, but I couldn't just let a pregnant woman lose her child. I'll represent you. Trial starts at 9:00am. Get some sleep. The next morning we walked into the courthouse together. Nadia could barely walk. Her stomach was huge. She looked terrified. The prosecutor saw us coming and smiled like he'd already won. The trial started. The prosecutor played the security footage first. Clear as day, Nadia pointing a loaded gun at the store clerk's face, taking money and baby supply eyes. The jury watched in silence, already deciding she was guilty. Then the store clerk testified. He was shaking. She put the gun against my forehead right here. He pointed. She said, give me everything or I'll shoot. I thought she was going to kill me. I stood up fast. Your honor, my client was desperate. She was homeless and pregnant. Executor cut me off. Motive doesn't matter, your honour. A crime is a crime. Judge Brenner agreed. Overruled. Sit down, counselor. I tried again. I wanted to show the jury the full extent of Nadia's situation, how she had no money, how she was living in her car, how they would have done the same in her shoes. But the prosecutor stood up. He was smirking. Now, desperation doesn't excuse armed robbery, your honour. If it did, we'd have to let half the criminals in the city go free. Three jurors nodded. I was losing. Then the prosecutor dropped his bomb. He showed Nadia's internet history. Three days before the robbery, she'd searched pawn shops, store hours, how much baby items sell for. This proves she planned it, the prosecutor said. This wasn't desperation. This was a calculated crime. I jumped up. She was trying to find Ways to get money for her baby. The prosecutor looked at me without blinking. Planning a crime while pregnant doesn't make it less of a crime. I looked at Nadia, who was clutching her belly.

My parents sat me and my husband next to a stinking trash bin. When I said I can't stand the smell, please, can we sit somewhere else? My mother yelled, first, hand over all the baby essentials to your sister. Her baby is more important and pay $7,000. When I refused, she shoved me hard and I fell straight into the pool. As I struggled to resurface, they all laughed, saying if she doesn't come back up, we can just get everything. My sister smirked, finally, my baby gets everything. The violent impact broke my water and I screamed in pain until my husband struck back. My mom's face turned pale with fear. The certified male invitation should have been my warning. Who requires a signature for a baby shower? At 35 weeks pregnant, Madison's shower invitation arrived. Derek wanted to skip it. Your mom literally said Madison deserves a baby more. Six months earlier, my mother announced Madison pregnant on her honeymoon was more deserving. Never mind our three years of IVF, never mind the $40,000 we'd spent. But refusing meant endless guilt trips. So we went. The backyard was Pinterest, perfect white balloons, three tier cake, designer everything. My mother spotted me. Claire, you're enormous. Are you sure it's not twins? Just one baby. Mom, Madison showing such a neat little bum. Very ladylike. Then came the seating chart. Our names behind fake Ivy, directly behind three overflowing Trash bins. August heat had turned them rancid, rotting fruit and sour milk. They did not put us next to the garbage, Derek said. Everyone else got shade and perfect views. We got trash corner. I approached my mother. There's been a mix up. The smell with my pregnancy, nausea. The tables were arranged specifically. Madison spent hours on the seating chart. My father appeared. It's just a few hours. Stop being dramatic. Derek's voice went cold. You seated your pregnant daughter next to rotting garbage on purpose. If she doesn't like it, she can leave something cracked inside me. Before we sit, Madison owes me $7,000. The yard went silent. For the crib, stroller, car seat and nursery furniture I bought. You said her baby was more important. Madison flushed. Those were gifts, loans. I have the text. You'd pay me back after your shower. Well, I held out my phone. My mother's eyes went wild. You're not ruining Madison's day, then write a check right now or I'm sitting by these trash bins and telling every guest.

I was a project manager at a tech company for six years. Me and my freelance team built everything they sold, but Carlos kept us as contractors to save money on benefits and job security. Then Vanessa showed up last spring. No degree, no experience in tech, but suddenly she's in every meeting, taking notes and contributing nothing useful. Carlos promoted her three times in four months, while my team's contract renewal kept getting delayed with excuse use after excuse. I tried to ignore the office rumors, but it became impossible. She'd show up late every morning with Starbucks for both of them. He'd laugh way too hard at her unfunny jokes during meetings. My coworkers started an actual betting pool on how long until HR got involved. Meanwhile, I'm working 60 hour weeks. I just closed a deal worth $2 million and developed a software solution that became their best selling product that quarter. My team work nights and weekends to meet impossible deadlines. Carlos kept promising clients without consulting us first. One Friday afternoon at four PM, he called me into his office. Performance isn't meeting our standards anymore, he said while barely looking at me. Vanessa will be taking over your projects effective immediately, starting Monday. I asked him to specify which standards I wasn't meeting. He shuffled random papers on his desk and said, we're restructuring to use full time employees. Only because contractors aren't sustained for long term growth. The exact same thing I've been begging him for since year two. I'd sent emails, proposals, Powerpoint presentations requesting to bring my entire team on as full time employees. He always claimed budget constraints wouldn't allow it. Apparently budget constraints appeared when it came to hiring his girlfriend. I had exactly 30 minutes to pack up my desk. Security actually stood there watching me like I was some kind of criminal. Vanessa smirked at me from my old office window as I carried boxes to my car in the rain. She was already rearranging my shelves and putting up those cringey Pinterest quotes about being a girl boss and manifesting success. I drove home and ugly cried in my driveway for a solid hour. My wife found me there and had to walk.

I stayed in mind the rest of the night. The next morning at breakfast, I didn't talk to anyone. Ashley used my purse to go to school. Mom acted like everything was normal at school. My friend Becca asked why I looked so mad. I told her the whole story and she said that was the most unfair thing she'd ever heard. He suggested I tell my dad when he got back from his work trip on Friday. I said maybe, but I wasn't sure he'd believe me either since mom already decided I was wrong. Thursday after school, I was doing homework and my room when I heard Ashley and her friend talking really loud in her room next door. Her friend was complimenting the purse and Ashley said, thanks, my aunt got it for me for my birthday. Not that our aunt got it for me and she borrowed it. She straight up told her friend it was hers. I grabbed my phone, which I'd hidden instead of giving to mom and recorded them through the wall. The audio was clear enough to hear Ashley claim the purse was a gift to her. Then her friend asked if she could borrow it sometime and Ashley said maybe. She didn't really like lending her stuff out. Friday night, dad came home and I showed him the recording his Face got really serious and he called both mom and Ashley downstairs, asked Ashley directly if the purse was hers or mine. She stuttered and said it was hers. Then he played the recording for my birthday video where you could clearly hear my aunt saying this is for you and handing me the purse. Ashley's face went red. Dad asked mom why I was grounded. Mom explained about me going in Ashley's room. Dad said that didn't make sense because it was my purse and I've been asking for it back for over a month. He asked mom why she didn't just make Ashley return it. When I first asked, mom got defensive and said she didn't realize it had been that long. Dad told her that wasn't good enough and that grounding me for wanting my own property back was ridiculous. He ungrounded me right there and told Ashley she was grounded for 3 weeks for lying and stealing. Ashley started crying and ran upstairs. Mom tried to argue, but dad said, no, this was wrong. And he wasn't backing down. He told me to go get my purse from Ashley's room. When I went up there, Ashley threw it at me and called me a snitch. I've had my purse back for 5 days now and Ashley still isn't talking to me.

I tried apologizing, tried explaining. The messages just say read. No response. My house is silent. The photo wall is still perfect, every frame straight. But when I look at it now, I don't see my wife. I see three years of soccer games. I missed science fairs. I skipped swim meets. I didn't attend birthday dinners where I talked about a dead woman instead of the living daughter sitting across from me. Last week, I got a notification. She blocked me on social media. I lost my wife to cancer. I lost my daughter to grief. And I have nobody to blame but myself.

Ashley's Instagram perfect life was built entirely on credit cards, maxed to $78,000. They were drowning and saw my house as their life raft. I waited, I played along.

I called every vendor, the photographer, the caterer, the florist, the venue. Hi, this is Ryan Mitchell calling about the Henry Mitchell wedding. I need to inform you that all payments made on credit card ending in 4, 7, 8, 2 need to be reversed. The card was reported stolen. It wasn't stolen. It was my parents card, which they'd added me as an authorized user on years ago for emergencies. I'd never removed myself. Technically, I had every right to dispute charges I didn't authorize.

Only three underclassmen made it that year. She came home waving the acceptance letter. Dad, I made varsity. I was standing in the hallway, the one covered floor to ceiling with photos of my late wife, wedding pictures or high school swim trophies. Each vacations, I'd spent two weekends building it. After the funeral, I looked at a photo of my wife teaching our daughter to swim when she was 3. Your mom would have been so proud. She taught you in that exact. Remember? My daughter's smile faded. Yeah, dad, I remember. She went to her room. I heard the door closed. That became every single conversation. When she made honor roll, I showed her my wife's valedictorian plaque. When she won regionals, I pulled out a box of my wife's medals and spread them on the kitchen table. Look at these. This is what real dedication looks like. She just stared at them. When she asked me to come to parent teacher night, I said I couldn't. It was the anniversary of my wife's death. I needed to go to this cemetery. But, dad, it's only once a year and it's my junior year. It matters. Your mom matters, too. I went to the grave instead sat There three hours talking to a headstone.

Your mom and I came here for our first anniversary. She ordered the same thing, same table. Actually, my daughter put her menu down. Dad, do you even know what place I got at regionals. I opened my mouth, nothing came out. Third place, she said. Her voice was quiet. Out of 47 swimmers, I texted you the results. I called you four times.

He was just slow, weak from not eating right for weeks. Took him home that night, fed him, got him cleaned up. Slowly he started remembering things. He told me Patricia had him in some cheap facility for a while, the kind that smells like piss and has one nurse for 50 people. She had power of attorney, drained his whole bank account, told him his son didn't want to see him anymore. When the facility got too expensive, she just stopped paying. They kicked him out and she never came back. He'd been on the streets for almost a month. I found out later she had Remarried some rich guy in Arizona, just left my dad like trash and moved on. I documented everything, got his old medical records, found the forged signatures, traced where his money went, reported her for elder abuse and fraud. Police opened an investigation, but Patricia had already disappeared into her new life. Dad lives with me now. He's getting stronger, starting to smile again. But Patricia never faced anything real. She's just gone, living somewhere else, like none of it happened.

Not for staying out late or failing a test. For wanting my own purse back from my sister. It started when I got this new purse for my birthday from my aunt. Was this really nice black leather one with gold zippers. Nothing crazy expensive, but it was mine. I've been carrying it everywhere for, like, three weeks. When my sister Ashley asked if she could borrow it for a party, I said, sure, just bring it back the next day. That was six weeks ago. Every time I asked for it back, Ashley had some excuse. Oh, it's at my friend's house, or I forgot it in my car, or I'll get it tomorrow, I promise. By Week 4, I stopped believing her. By Week 5, I was getting actually mad because I knew she was just using it and didn't want to give it back. So last Tuesday, I went into her room while she was at volleyball practice. I wasn't snooping or anything. I was just looking for my purse, and I found it sitting right there on her desk chair, like she'd been using it that morning. Inside was all her stuff. Her wallet, her makeup, her keys. Like she just completely claimed it as hers. I took it back to my room and started moving my stuff back into it. That's when Ashley came home early and saw me through my open door. She literally screamed, At me for going through her things. I told her it was my purse, and I was just taking back what was mine. She ran downstairs crying to mom. Five minutes later, mom came up and told me I was grounded for two weeks. No phone, no going out, nothing. I asked her why, and she said because I invaded Ashley's privacy by going in her room without permission. I tried explaining that I was just getting my own purse back, the one Ashley borrowed and never returned for six weeks. Mom said it didn't matter, that I should have asked her to help me get it back instead of taking matters into my own hands. I pointed out that I've been asking Ashley for weeks, and she kept lying. Mom said that still didn't give me the right to go in her room. Ashley was standing behind mom with this smug look on her face. Then mom told me to give the purse back to Ashley until my grounding was over as part of my punishment. I couldn't believe it. I was being

The second I hit the water, I felt the strings on my back come loose. The bikini top slid down. I tried to grab it, but it was already floating away from me. I came up to the surface with my arm across my chest. My top was floating three feet away. People were staring. Some guy laughed. Oh, my god, someone said. I looked up. Trevor was standing at the edge of the pool with his mouth open. Kyle was next to him, also staring. I realised my arm had slipped and everyone could see everything. I dunked back under the water and finally got the top back on. When I came up again, my face was burning. I swam to the ladder and climbed out as fast as I could. Jenna was standing there with a towel. Oh, no. You said it wouldn't fall off. I hissed at her. I didn't think you'd jump off the diving board. You told me to get in the pool. I wrapped the towel around myself and pushed past her. I went back into the bathroom and locked the door. I could hear people laughing outside. I changed back into my regular clothes and stuffed the bikini in the trash can. When I came out, Jenna was waiting in the hallway. Trevor feels really bad. Trevor saw everything. So did, like, 15 other people. It's not that big of a deal. Your Boyfriend saw me naked. Jenna. I pushed past her and walked out the front door. She followed me down the driveway. Where are you going? Home. It's like three miles. I'll walk. I made it two blocks before she pulled up next to me in her car. Get in. I'll drive you. I got in. We didn't talk the whole way. When she pulled up to my house, I got out without saying anything. I'm sorry. She called after me. I really didn't think that would happen. I went inside and deleted every photo from the party off my Instagram. And I blocked Kyle. Monday morning, I walked into math class, and he was already sitting there. When he saw me, he waved. I sat down in my usual seat and stared at my desk for the entire period. The next week was horrible. People I didn't even know were coming up to me asking about the party. Someone made a joke about it in the cafeteria. I started eating lunch in the library.

I literally couldn't process that for a second. What do you mean, was? He's still alive. Lives in a care home about an hour from where grandma was. She had him when she was 17, way before she married Grandpa. He was born with some kind of developmental condition. Back then, the church and her parents basically forced her to give him up. Told her she'd ruin her life keeping him. But the photos. She visited him every month for almost 40 years. Bought him birthday cards, his favorite snacks. Paid for extra stuff the state wouldn't cover. She just never told anyone. Not even Grandpa. Does mom know? Brian laughed, but wasn't a happy laugh. Your mom found out when she was, like, 15. She saw some papers in grandma's car. They didn't talk for almost two years after that. Then they just pretended it never happened. Family is really good at that. I couldn't sleep that whole night. The next morning, mom was in the kitchen packing up grandma's dishes, and I just asked her directly. Why didn't you tell me about Ari? She stopped moving. Didn't turn around. Wasn't my story to tell. But it's our family. She finally looked at me, and her eyes were red. You don't understand what it was like back then. She didn't have a choice. Her parents would have disowned her. The church would have shamed her. She was a kid. Where is he now? She wrote Down an address on a napkin. Clearwater Care Center. But I don't know if you should. I went the next day. Didn't tell anyone. The place was actually really nice. Not depressing like I expected. A nurse brought me to this common room where this older guy was doing a puzzle. He had grandma's eyes. Same exact green color. Ari, I said. He looked up and smiled real big. Do I know you? I'm your nephew. I'm Marie's grandson. His whole face changed when I said her name. Marie came every month. She brought me chocolate chip cookies. The good kind from the bakery. We talked for, like, an hour. He showed me drawings he'd made. Told me about his favorite TV shows, me about school. He was just a regular person. Just needed some help with stuff. When I was leaving, he grabbed my hand. Are you coming back? Yeah, I said, I'm coming back. I've been going every two weeks since then. Mom came with me last month. She cried the whole time. Turns out grandma left money in her will specifically for Ari's care. Nobody knew until the lawyer read it out loud. My mom's been visiting him now, too.

When I opened it, I found a notice telling me to move out of my own house. I smiled, and a few months later returned the favor at their wedding. My 30th birthday started like any other family gathering. Mom insisted on hosting at my place because, quote, your house has the best space for everyone. I should have seen it coming. My younger brother Henry and his fiance Ashley showed up first, followed by my parents and extended family. Everyone seemed weirdly excited. Exchange knowing glances. Then came the moment before Cake. Mom announced, we have a very special gift for you, Sweetheart. Ashley handed me an elegantly wrapped box with a bow. The room went silent as I untied the ribbon. Inside was a single envelope. No card, no note, just legal paperwork. 60 day notice to vacate my own house. I looked up slowly. Henry was grinning. Surprise! We bought your house! What? I said. Still processing. Well, technically, we made an offer to mom and dad, Ashley chimed in. Since they co signed your mortgage five years ago, they're technically co owners. They agreed to sell us their share, which gives us majority ownership. So legally, you're the tenant now. My mother smiled sweetly. He thought this would be perfect for Henry and Ashley to start their marriage. You're always traveling for work anyway. You don't really need all this space. This is my house. I Said quietly, I've paid every single mortgage payment for five years. Dad shrugged. But we're on the deed. That makes it partly ours. We're just exercising our rights. Henry leaned back, smug. Don't make this dramatic, Ryan. Ashley and I need a real home for our future kids. You're single. You can rent somewhere smaller. The rage inside me was volcanic, but something else took over. Cold calculation. I smiled. Wow, this is incredibly thoughtful. Everyone relaxed, interpreting my calm as acceptance. See? Mom said, I knew you'd understand once you thought about it. I nodded, slowly setting the notice down. When's the wedding again? June 15th, Ashley said proudly. At the Botanical Gardens. It's going to be magical. Can't wait, I replied, still smiling. That night, I called my real estate lawyer. She laughed when I explained the situation.

Jenna had been begging me for two weeks to come to Trevor's pool party. I kept saying no, but she wouldn't stop. She showed up at my house on Saturday morning with a bag from target. I bought you a bathing suit, she said, dumping it on my bed. It was this bright pink bikini with tiny strings holding everything together. You're coming, and you're wearing this? That thing looks like it'll fall apart if I breathe wrong. It's cute. Stop being boring. She gave me this look. Trevor's friend Kyle is going to be there. You've been staring at him in math class for three months. That got me. I looked at the bikini again. The top had these weird criss cross strings in the back. Fine. But if this falls off, I'm blaming you. It won't fall off. I wear tops like that all the time. We got to Trevor's house around 2. His backyard was packed. Pool was full of people, and there were maybe 30 more just standing around with red cups. I saw Kyle immediately. He was by the diving board talking to some guys. I went inside to change in Trevor's bathroom. The bikini was even worse than I thought. The top had four different strings, and I couldn't figure out which one tied where. I spent 10 minutes trying different combinations. Finally, I got it to stay on. The strings in the back felt Loose. But when I jumped up and down, everything stayed in place. When I came back outside, Jenna whistled, see? You look hot. I walked over to the pool and sat on the edge with my feet in the water. Kyle was still by the diving board, but now he was looking my way. He smiled, and I smiled back. Let's get in, Jenna said behind me. She gave me a little push on my shoulder. I slid in. The water was actually kind of cold. I swam over to the shallow end. After a few minutes, Kyle swam over. Hey, he said. You're in my math class, right? We talked for maybe five minutes. He asked if I wanted to see him do a flip off the diving board. He climbed out and did this running jump and flipped in the air before hitting the water. That was actually cool. I called out, your turn! He yelled back, I can't do a flip. Just jump in, then. Come on! I didn't want to look scared, so I walked over to the diving board. Everyone was watching.

My Uncle Wade supposedly died in a boating accident before I was even born. My whole life there was this huge framed photo of him in our hallway. My dad kept fresh flowers under it every single week. Without fail, everyone called Wade the kind one, the adventure, the brother my dad never got over losing. I grew up hearing stories about how amazing he was, how tragic it was that he drowned so young. When I was 17, I was helping my mom clean out the garage because we were finally getting rid of old junk. Shoved behind some Christmas decorations, I found this ancient camcorder with a tape still inside. The battery was completely dead. So I took it to my room and charged it for like three hours. I was bored and curious, so I hit play. The first few minutes were just random birthday footage from the 90s. Some kid blowing out candles, people laughing in the background, pretty boring stuff. But then the camera turned and I saw him, Wade, sitting on a couch laughing at something off camera. He looked older than in the hallway photo, way older. And then I saw it, the date stamped in the corner of the video. It was from 6 years after he supposedly died. My stomach dropped. I rewound it 3 times to make sure I wasn't seeing things wrong. Same date, same face. He was Alive in that video years after the boating accident that killed him. I ran downstairs with the camcorder still in my hands. My mom was folding laundry in the living room. I shoved the screen in her face and asked her to explain what I was seeing. The color drained from her face instantly. She didn't try to lie or make excuses, just stared at the screen for a long time, then whispered, don't ever show that to your father. That was it. No explanation, just a warning. She wouldn't say anything else. No matter how much I pushed. She just kept folding the same towel over and over, not looking at me. I couldn't let it go. Over the next few weeks, I started digging. I went.

I never thought that guy, even in his final moments, would waste his last breath cursing me. As always, I followed my routine. I carved the body into nine pieces and dumped them into the sea. I thought it was foolproof. But this time my method betrayed me. Two treasure hunters stumbled upon the black bags at the bottom of the ocean. Believing they had struck gold, they opened them, only to find human remains. The site nearly drove them mad with fear. It wasn't long before the underwater graveyard became headline news across Miami. He sat watching the live broadcast, my pulse racing. Thirty bodies had already been recovered and the divers were still working. 30 bags? Do you know what that means? Means there might be a new mass murderer out there. Way worse than the ice truck killer. Maybe I can finally get some peace. She never imagined that monster was me. On the surface, I acted calm, indifferent. But inside, panic gnawed at me. The next day, the department assigned their best investigator, Agent Randy. The moment I saw him, I knew he wasn't someone to be underestimated. At the briefing, Randy delivered a chilling reminder. There's no such thing as a perfect crime. Every criminal leaves a trace. The words sent a shiver straight down my spine. I can't afford to lose it like this. Not with Special Agent Rock Star on my case. That night, I slipped into the morgue. I Kicked the coolant pipe until it burst, then dragged over a trash bin to make it look like an accident caused by janitors. By morning, the corpses were spoiled, the stench overwhelming. I thought I had erased their evidence. But then a colleague told me the investigators weren't focusing on the remains at all. They were studying the stones used to weigh down the bags. By analyzing the algae clinging to the rocks, they could determine which dock the killer's boat had been anchored at. Me mind raced with images of the electric chair or a lethal injection. Just the thought made me break out in a cold sweat. That night, I rushed to clean every trace from my sailboat, scrubbing it until my hands shook. I thought I had covered my tracks, but what I didn't realize was that the whole cleanup had been caught on the nearby surveillance cameras.

After the game, he took off his jacket and draped it over her. The three walked together, his friend chatting happily with her. He remained silent, not uttering a word, until the two of them got into the car and drove away. He watched them depart, then returned home and took a hot shower. His wife noticed the jacket carried a scent. After checking the pockets, she turned, grabbed a pair of Scissors and headed to the bathroom. He explained it was a hair tie his friend used while playing pool, but clearly no one would believe such a far fetched story. Just as the situation threatened to spiral out of control, his friend arrived in time and asked his wife to return the rubber band he'd lost. The misunderstanding was cleared up. Watching his friend show off the rubber band to him, he felt a mix of emotions. The next morning at work, he absent mindedly kneaded dough.

Just as I was thinking about going another round, a bunch of FBI agents suddenly burst through the door. I tried to ask what was going on, but one of the cops immediately slammed me to the ground and slapped handcuffs on me. The FBI quickly turned up a ton of contraband, ammunition and cash. During their search of my place, I found two AK 47 seconds. That pretty much killed any chance I had of making bail. So no possibility of reduced sentence. I got great lawyers. They turn water into wine. I let out a bitter laugh. Soon after, I was arrested and thrown in jail for illegal possession of contraband and weapons. I figured my father would get me out quickly, but instead he chose to cut a deal with the prosecutor to protect the family's interests. He told me to plead guilty and promised he'd work to get my sentence reduced to four years. This devastating news was hard to swallow, but under my father's insistence, I agreed to the plea deal. During the trial, I openly admitted to the charges. However, the judge decided that I was using heavy weapons to protect contraband and sentenced me to 10 years in prison under the minimum sentencing guideline. That's when it hit me. Both my father and I have been played by the prosecutor. Few Months later, a guard suddenly escorted me to the infirmary, waiting for me with a prosecutor and a female agent. The female agent had noticed I was doing pretty well in prison. Not only had I built friendly relationships with all the major gangs, but I was also running my own business. They valued my ability to get along with anyone and wanted to make a deal with them. They wanted me to get close to a serial killer. This killer had murdered many people, but the police had never found the victim's bodies, so they needed me to gather more useful information. In exchange, they would reduce my remaining sentence. The offer sounded tempting, but I knew that prisons housing serial killers were full of mentally unstable inmates, so I turned them down flat. The prosecutor told me to think it over before making my final decision, and left me with a file. Before leaving that night, I opened the file, and what I found inside deeply shook me. This killer had already murdered more than a dozen people, specifically targeting young girl. All the evidence pointed to a man with a heavy beard, but strangely, the police had never found any bodies, which prevented them from securing a conviction. After reading through the file, I didn't know what to do. So the next day, I asked my father for his advice.

During that break, I brought my niece home, but she lost all her energy. Even my best fish dish could not lift her appetite. The week ended fast. I went back to the restaurant. The moment I walked in, I felt something was off. The place was louder than ever. In the kitchen, I saw a new head chef. His style was nothing like mine. He was funny and easy going. He cooked with music blasting. For the first time, I felt my position threatened. I went straight to the boss, told him firmly my kitchen didn't need a clown. But he told me this man was the rising star in New York. I still had no good feelings toward him. To draw a clear line, I split the work list in half, made it clear we would not interfere.

But at the top, an iron gate blocked my way. Hope collapsed in an instant. I fell into the pit of despair. I had no choice but to return. Rage burned inside me. I needed to know what this madman wanted. Simon looked at me. He finally spoke. He was a professor. The woman Robin was once his student. He built the secret cage to trap the women he wanted.

She reported it to the teacher who made us both stay after school. I apologized to Esme, but she chose the largest pad for me. This time I calm down. Why do periods make us so weird? To change things, I came up with a good idea. During the school event, I let everyone across the finish line. Each of us had a red stain on our pants. My boyfriend even thought we were on our periods. I laughed and explained that it was because we had all used red paint. It Was a protest against the shame of the times. It's Shark Week already. You know, that's actually kind of funny.

I pulled off my broken goggles. My eyes flew wide open. I was hanging on a cliff. Below me was endless fog and rock. My parachute was stuck on a dead tree. When I touched the cliff wall, it crumbled like soft rock. I drew my dagger and stabbed it into my shoe, turning it into a climbing tool. Kicked hard with both feet, swung my body upward and drove the blades into the wall. I struggled to climb higher, but after only a few meters, the dagger snapped in half. My feet slipped and I fell back to where I started. Worse still, the dead tree began to crack. The parachute was about to fall into the abyss. At the edge of death, I slashed the straps with all my strength. Just as the tree collapsed, I finally cut the parachute free, but without it, I had nothing to hold me. Me body was pressed flat against the wall. If my strength failed, it was over. In despair, the goat suddenly cried out, as if giving me a hint. I looked up. It climbed the cliff with ease. Hope sparked inside me. I let go and wedged myself into a crack in the rock. Bit by bit, I climbed through the gap and reached a small ledge. But the top was still meters away. The wall was smooth, no place to grip. The ledge beneath me crumbled. I could hardly Believe I made it. But just as I reached the top, a fierce ram charged straight at me. Its horn slammed into me, almost knocking me off the edge. When it came again, I grabbed its horns tight, ready to go down with it. But it didn't throw me off. Instead, it pushed back with all its strength, dragging me up the cliff. I collapsed on the grass, staring at it in shock. I couldn't believe it saved me. In that moment, I made a silent vow never to eat lamb again.

That meant 95% of them would be left behind. The project leader had already boarded the helicopter in advance. But he had no intention of rescuing his colleagues.

He released the toxic gas inside an airport terminal. A new crisis was about to begin.

I quickly asked my husband what was going on. He said the man in front of me was a top plastic surgeon. He was here to help transform my body. I refused immediately, saying I didn't need any surgery. But my husband didn't give up. He handed me a photo of a beautiful woman. The surgeon said he could make me look exactly like her. Staring at that perfect face, I finally gave in. I had no idea this decision would completely change my life. The next day, while at a cafe, I noticed the waitress looked oddly familiar. When I pulled out the photo, I was shocked she was the exact woman my husband wanted me to look like. To find out what was going on, I quickly called her over. Do you happen to know Patrick Savage? Patrick, I ruined your life. Savage, of course I do, but I wish I didn't. What do you mean? Patrick Savage is my ex boyfriend who stalked me after we broke up. Because of him, I had to leave the city for three years. I just came back last week and I really was hoping to never hear his name again. After hearing her story, I finally understood my husband's true intention. I told the waitress who I really was. Then I asked her to help me carry out a plan. Two months later, my surgery was done when The bandages came off. My husband was stunned. He couldn't believe I looked exactly like his ex girlfriend. He completely lost control, picked me up and rushed to the bedroom. But just as he was about to touch me, I pushed him away. Then I grabbed a camera and said I wanted to record this beautiful moment. He didn't suspect a thing and agreed. After setting up the camera, I went back to bed. When he tried to get close again, I pushed him away once more. Then I pulled a divorce agreement from the drawer and threw it at him. Divorce agreement? But why? Because you cheated on your wife with me. What are you talking about? Your plan was almost perfect, Patrick. That's when he realized he'd been exposed. He tried to apologize, but I wasn't buying it anymore. The recording was all the proof I needed of his betrayal. In the end, he was kicked out of the house for good.

She says if she waters it 20,000 times, the stone will grant her any wish. But I never believed her. I grabbed a crowbar and knocked the stone over. Then I picked it up and carried it away. The villagers quickly put their hands together and prayed devoutly. But to their surprise, I carried the stone straight under the waterfall. Then I told my mother, this way we could water it 50,000 times at once. But soon something strange happened. A mask suddenly fell to my feet. From that day on, I couldn't stop staring at it, until one day I accidentally traced the outline of the face on the mask. I slowly drew out the person's features, and somehow I felt my heart race. So I ran toward the top of the waterfall. When I reached the source, I saw a fairy covered in colorful butterflies. I leapt toward her with all my strength, but just as I grabbed a branch, she vanished. Following her guidance, I climbed through the waterfall for three days and nights. Finally, I made a bow and arrow from branches. I jumped and fired an arrow. The sword pierced through a tall tree and got stuck at the top. I finally made it to the summit. The fairy was right in front of me. Just as I reached out to touch her, Annie turned into a butterfly and flew away. I searched the forest for her traces. Suddenly, I heard a scream. I ran to check it out. I saw Annie running out of the woods with soldiers chasing behind her. It was clear she was being hunted. To protect her, I followed them closely. When the soldiers were about to catch her, Annie shouted a mysterious spell. A sword flew through the air. He turned around and the blade pierced through the soldier's body. Then the rest of the soldiers fell one by one. Turns out archers were hidden among the trees and he killed every soldier below without a single drop of blood on her. In that moment, I was completely captivated. So to catch her, I set a trap to lure her in. Soon she fell right into it. I happily came to take a look, but suddenly a sword pressed against my back. She had somehow gotten behind me and her sword pierced into my body. I told her I had already fallen in love with her. Then I held her tightly in my arms. Unfortunately, we rolled down the snowy mountain together. Annie was furious. She tried to strike me down. I flipped backward and tore off her sleeve. Then I turned and pulled off her coat, lifted her long hair and washed her under the waterfall, crushed berries to draw eyeliner and lipstick on her face. She turned around and saw me holding the mask she had lost and she realized I had come for her. She was touched and hugged. Me tightly, but she still had to rescue the princess, so she knocked me out and left alone. Not long after she left, an accident happened. A soldier threw a fishing net over her, catching her alive. When they tried to harm her, I showed up just in time. As the soldiers got closer, I pushed down a huge boulder. It stopped the pursuers, but unexpectedly the impact triggered a landslide. I quickly grabbed some tree bark and slid down the slope with Annie. Just as the snow was about to bury us alive, a cliff appeared ahead. I leapt forward with her and we both survived. Soon I arrived at the palace where workers were raising a giant statue of the king. But suddenly, a slave slipped, triggering a chain reaction.

She discovered she could control her own blood. But in the next moment, despair took over her. Uncontrollable blood pierced her mother's throat. She didn't even have time to scream. Her power spiraled out of control again. Her father, rushing to help, lost his life as well. And the horrifying scene was witnessed by her younger sister. For her sister, there was no doubt her sister was a murderer. Just like that, the once happy family of four was shattered because of Mary's uncontrollable powers. Mary loathed her abilities with all her heart, but she knew she had to learn to control them. Only by mastering this power could she stop hurting innocent people. But as soon as she entered the superhuman university, regret set in. The training methods here were brutally harsh. At any moment, life threatening, danger alert. What made it worse for Mary was that she was placed in the performing arts college. University is divided into two main colleges, the Lamp Bearer College and the Crimson Count College. The Lamp Bearer College focuses on crime fighting and it's the most popular college in the university. The top 10 elite students are almost all gathered here. Crimson Count College, however, is completely different. It specializes in developing superhuman talents for the entertainment industry. Most graduates end up in showbiz, but Mary had no interest in singing or dancing, so she decided to apply for a Major change. Before she even met with the professor, a female assistant blocked her at the door. Mary still tried to argue, but then the professor suddenly shot a gun. The female assistant in an instant turned into a man. It turned out he was Jordan, ranked second in the school with the high level ability to change genders. Mary didn't have time to be surprised and quickly explained her request to the professor. But things didn't go smoothly. Her request was rejected on the spot and the professor even kicked her out of the office. Her abilities were still not enough to be take and seriously. Later, Mary made a friend, Andre, ranked third in the school. But when Andre showed her his abilities, an accident happened. His powers went out of control and he accidentally injured a passerby. Seeing the trouble he had caused, Andre's friends immediately fled the scene. Looking at the injured person lying in a pool of blood, Mary was flooded with memories of her mother's tragic death. She couldn't let the tragedy repeat. With a gentle move of her hands, the blood flowed back into the passerby's body. She didn't stop until she confirmed the person's heartbeat had returned. Mary finally breathed a sigh of relief. Her act of saving the person went viral online. Overnight, Mary became a national icon. But the school didn't reward her. Instead, they expelled her, citing the incident with the injury. The school in order to protect its Reputation needed a scapegoat from those present. Since Andre was a top 3 elite student, Mary became the sacrifice. Her blood control ability was deemed too ordinary in the professor's eyes. It had no value. She was completely disregarded. Mary was driven out of the university, having lost her parents at a young age. Now being expelled from school, Mary felt as if her life had lost all meaning. So Mary decided to prove herself to the professor one last time. But when she pushed open the professor's door, the sight that greeted her froze her in place.

Ready? Do you need a count? No, sir. I am Buster Scrub. I was strumming my guitar and singing as I rode through the western wilderness, taking my sweet time down the dusty trail. When I came across a saloon, I dismounted and strolled inside. The place was packed with cowboys and my outfit stuck out like a sore thumb among them. Ignoring their hostile stares, I brushed the dust off my coat and asked the bartender for a whiskey. like me a splash of whiskey to wash the trail dust off in me gullet and keep my singing voice in fest. But he just gave me a sideways glance and said coldly that this is a dry county. I turned to look at the cowboys behind me, brazenly drinking their booze and demanded to know why they got to drink. And we don't drink with tin horns, sir. It seems that you are no better a judge of human beings than you are a specimen of one. I told the bartender, I'm Wilder than any of these cowboys. Prove it was true. I turned around and started picking a fight with the Cowboys behind me. The bearded guy flew into a rage and was about to make his move. Your shooting ironwork. But before he could even draw his gun, a bullet had already blown through his skull. The other cowboys witnessed this and went absolutely ballistic. They all drew their weapons at once and The saloon instantly filled with gun smoke, turning into a complete battlefield. In less than a minute, I had taken them all down. The way I turned and holstered my gun was smooth as silk. Since I couldn't get a drink there, I headed into town to find another saloon. But when I entered the town, I discovered they had a new rule, absolutely no firearms allowed. So I handed over my twin pistols and the hidden gun strapped to my leg, then walked over to the poker table with a grin. But as soon as I sat down, I watched some cowboy who just lost all his chips storm off in a huff, shoving the lousy hand of cards into my hands. I glanced at the terrible cards and was about to fold, but the other players wouldn't let me leave. You've seen them. You play. And if an adult, the man sitting across from me, pulled out a gun. I had followed the rules, but apparently not everyone was playing fair. Seeing I was unarmed, he figured he'd send me to me my maker. Too bad he picked the wrong guy to mess with. I quickly kicked up a wooden plank from the table's edge, and in less than three seconds, he was meeting his maker. Instead, the gambling hall went dead silent, then erupted in cheers as if this bloody scene was nothing more than entertainment. But it wasn't long before the dead man's brother showed up. When he discovered his brother was dead and the whole saloon was cheering and dancing under my lead, hearing my name made him hesitate for a moment, but he still worked up the courage to challenge me, wanting to avenge his brother. As cowboys, we had to settle this the western way. Screws, I'm calling you out. Are you ready? Ready? Are you set? Set. Do you need a count? No. Listen, I've seen this scene 100 times before. I didn't even give him time to react. I drew first and shot off his trigger finger, then proceeded to blast him off one by one. You can't be too careful. He was forced to switch to his other hand. That's when I calmly turned around and pulled out a mirror. There was only one bullet left in the chamber, but I hoped I wouldn't miss one shot straight through the heart. That's how confident I am in my marksmanship.

Ah, although the metal door of the cell has been opened, but the mutant collar crushes Polaris, leaving her gasping for air. She has no strength left to escape. Then a guard spots her, all her efforts wasted to make sure she can't break free again. The prison decides to transfer her. They even build a custom transport just for Polaris, completely wrapped in plastic, for her, powers mean nothing. Meanwhile, the other mutants spring into action. They gather all their teammates, hatching a plan to rescue Polaris. They set up an ambush along the convoy's only route. Hours later, the transport appears in the distance. The team takes position. One mutant concentrates, and boom, a tire explodes. The van skids to a stop. The invisible man slips into free Polaris. Halfway there, he suddenly flickers, then fully appears. A sniper shot rings out and he collapses to the ground. Everyone freezes. Their power's gone. Ray looks out the window, and there he is, a man with glowing golden eyes scanning the battlefield like a machine. It's pulse, their former teammate, the one who can shut down mutant hours. With no powers left, they fight the old way, bare hands and fury. Amid the chaos, Ray seizes the moment and closes in on pulse and slams his fist into Pulse's face. Pulse drops, and instantly the suppression fades. Their powers surge back to life. Inside the prison van, the Guards start to panic. They rush to move Polaris out. But with her cellmate's help, the Two Strike back, taking the guards down together. Then comes the real problem. There's no metal here. Polaris's power is useless. But then her cellmate said to Polaris, the metal's screwing my leg. But Polaris can't bring herself to do it. Her cellmate grinds his teeth and says it's the only way. With no time left, she finally acts, ripping a steel pin straight from his leg and driving it through the shackles on their wrists. The guards see things going wrong and immediately call for backup. But it's already too late. Bang. The prison van doors are smashed open. Guards unleash a full, full barrage at Polaris, but she catches the bullets made air. Without the collar holding her back, she is absolute power incarnate. Just then, her teammates race in with the car, scooping everyone up and speeding off. But barely a few moments into their escape, they see the police chief blocking the road with his men. With no other choice, Polaris steps out to face them head on. Bullets fly. She doesn't even flinch. A simple flick of her hand and the chief's gun soars through the air straight to her. Seeing this, the chief has no choice. He surrenders. They drag him to an abandoned building. Polaris stretches out her hand. The steel beams inside the walls bend, instantly twisting around the chief's neck. You like putting collars on people? She says with a smirk, then taste what it's like to choke. Meanwhile, outside, the police have surrounded the entire building. Polaris spreads her arms wide. Hundreds of steel rods lift into the air, then shoot out like a storm of arrows toward the outside.

Sensing something was wrong, I called out to the AI to lower the seat, but there was no response. No matter how many times I shouted, the next moment my feet were locked firmly in place. Soon I was pushed to my limit, my long legs straining audibly under the pressure. On the verge of a serious injury, I reached desperately for the limit switch, but even with all my strength, I couldn't quite reach it. In a panic, I tried calling for help from my roommate inside, but the AI had activated soundproof mode. Not only did Nick not hear my cries for help, he was too busy enjoying the AI's automated shaving service. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, another man was about to light a cigarette. Without warning, the AI silently turned on the gas stove. Fortunately, he avoided disaster, but didn't think much of it. Then the AI suggested he drink a glass of water to calm his nerves. Seeing the cloudy liquid in the cup, the not so bright man thought it was some kind of specialty sparkling water. He completely failed to notice the corrosive smoke rising from where droplets had fallen from the dispenser. Unsuspecting, he gulped it down in one go. Just as I let out a scream, the man was burned by sulfuric acid. At the same time, Nick finally heard me and Came out with Anna to check. Thankfully, I was okay. I'd only cut my finger. But when the three of us returned inside, we found the man coughing up blood. His internal organs had been corroded by the acid. He died before he could utter his last words.

It was because he had joined a deadly game. The rule was simple but dangerous. If he could survive five weapon attacks in 24 hours, he would win $9 million to stay alive. He ran toward the train station, but a hunter was already waiting there. In this game, he wasn't allowed to call the police or quit. He rushed into a church to hide, but another killer was already there. The killer attacked quickly, but accidentally killed someone else. Then the real attacker appeared, locked the church doors, and came at Tom with a hammer. Just as the killer was about to strike, his hammer got stuck in the door. Tom used the moment to fight back, locked the killer inside and ran. But while escaping, the killer managed to hit Tom's leg with the hammer. Tom clean his wound with paint thinner and tried to keep going, but he collapsed. Meanwhile, another killer found out Tom was still alive and would arrive within the hour. Tom found a supermarket, grabbed a stadium uniform to disguise himself, blended into the crowd. When the killer arrived, he didn't recognize Tom at first, but then the store owner noticed the stolen uniform and pointed it out. The killer's attention turned straight to Tom. Tom quickly hid inside the open trunk of a car. The killer looked around, but couldn't find him. Scared, Tom thought, I need to get out of Here now, he got out of the car and went to a nearby gas station. There he stole a taxi and drove straight home to see his wife. But what he didn't know was that the killer had already gotten there first. You might wonder why the killers weren't shooting. It's because the rules of the game didn't allow it. As Tom tried to escape in the taxi, the killer threw a steel spike and popped one of the tires. Tom saw a chance, attacked the killer and knocked him down. But he didn't realize another killer was already hiding inside the taxi. Furious, Tom picked up a large rock and killed him on the spot. Five hours had now passed. Tom then boarded a private boat to hide. But even there, another killer was waiting. He was about to drink some water when a waitress suddenly stopped him and asked, who are you? Tom replied, just getting a drink. But the woman was also part part of the deadly game. A violent fight broke out. The woman was stronger and started to overpower Tom. He ran outside and grabbed onto a metal bridge. He didn't realize she would follow him. As soon as she caught up, Tom kicked her hard and knocked her into the water. Then he climbed up onto the bridge and escaped.

All of a sudden, seeing the terrifying look of the clown, he felt it was very strange, so he ran away at once. Almost scared out of his wits, he walked through one alley after another, thinking he could get rid of the clown. To his surprise, the clown was already waiting ahead. John felt an unprecedented sense of despair, and the clown immediately began a cruel game. The clown pulled colorful flags out of his mouth. In the end, the two of them pulled hard and refused to give in. As a result, what was pulled out of the man's mouth was a dozen playing cards. John thus went to see Jesus. When the clown lit the candle, his deadly game officially began when three unlucky young people met the clown. The clown took out a deck of cards and asked one of the boys wearing glasses to draw one. The boy drew a spades E. The joker shuffled the cards and asked the bespectacled man to draw another one. The result was that it wasn't a spades E at all. Three young people laughed at the clown for his poor magic skills. The clown felt extremely embarrassed and quickly shuffled another card, but the result was still the same. The Joker didn't pretend either. He directly found spades from the Deck

And mommy's going, are you saying I didn't buy them here? Are you calling me a liar? And he goes, no, I guess I can give you store credit. Then she saw store credit. Mommy, don't play that. Mommy plays for cash. Baba victory. And that's not even the best part. Oh, you had a receipt the whole time. Why didn't you use it? I like to challenge myself. Binder, baby. Oh look, that page is from when we did three returns in one day. What do you all want for dessert? Hector just made a pineapple right side up cake. We'll just take the usual one slice of key lime pie and five spoons. Although pineapple cake does sound good, no pie is superior because it is filled with nutritious fruit. It is the healthiest dessert. It is the food of shepherds, mathematicians. Pie, infinite possibilities. Cake represents joy, birthdays, graduations, retirements. No one's ever heard of a wedding. Pie. Every important milestone in your life, cake was there. Cake watched you grow up. And sure, some may say pie burst out, but I say pie is confused. Pie is murder. If you choose life, choose cake.

Oh, so then who are you to change the rules? Is Mr Save more here? Does he know that customers are no longer your first priority? Ma'am, you know, I love our weekly sparring sessions. This is my job as much as it is my gym some days. But you know how it would make me look to take back a phone that you didn't even buy here? I'm sorry, but my final answer is no. Do what you will. Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, Morse code. That's how we used to communicate. But now we use the telephone. It's what connects us. That's why it's vital to have one that you're happy with. I'm sorry, sir, but you're gonna have to wait. And with someone. I'll be honest with you, Roger, you're right. We didn't buy The phone at the store, but that shouldn't matter. Let me ask you something. Do you have a mother? I do. Well, imagine your mother taking time out of her busy day to come down here looking for help, only to have someone to embarrass her in front of you, her son. Do the right thing, Roger, not for the store, but for mothers everywhere. They're not perfect, but they're ours. Okay, I'm gonna take the phone back and use it to call my mother.

As the traffic light turned green, the man shot John a contemptuous glance. But John wouldn't give up so easily, vowing Bruno wouldn't lose again. Back home, John scolded Bruno, warning that if it happened again, there'd be no Turkey dinner. As he spoke, he made a gesture commanding the dog to lie down. Bruno remained unmoved. John warned again, his hand waving once more until finally Bruno lowered his head in obedience. The next day, John encountered the man and his dog again at the intersection. This time, John approached without hesitation. What's up? Oh, you again, huh? That's right. Bruno, sit. Angie, sit. Bruno, down. Angie, down. The man remained indifferent. John provocatively made the hand gesture. Bruno immediately responded. John grinned triumphantly. The man, seeing this, lost control. He frantically mimicked John's gesture, trying to command his own dog, but his dog just stood frozen in place. Just then, the light turned green. You have a nice day now, Angie, roll over. Roll over, Angie. A satisfied John jog down the street, unaware of a figure closing in behind him. Suddenly, a car slammed to a halt before him. A cloth was pressed over his nose and mouth, releasing the acrid smell of burning plastic. As John was about to pass out, he Saw Bruno being dragged into the car. When John slowly regained consciousness in the biting cold wind, only one thought filled his mind. Whoever had kidnapped Bruno, he would find them.

Then I jumped into the sea to spear fish, thinking everything was under control. Little did I know this moment would make me regret it for the rest of my life. When the guy woke up and found his goggles gone, he flew into a rage and grabbed a spear ready to sink me. My wife grabbed the spear to stop him, but she was too weak. She couldn't hold it and even tore her clothes in the struggle. Seeing that, the guy didn't hesitate when I came back full of fish and tossed the goggles to him, he should have been angry, but instead he seemed oddly pleased. I felt something was off, but I didn't think too much of it and proudly showed off my prize, just wanting to fill my stomach. Then I noticed my wife's eyes darting away and my chest tightened. He didn't say a word, and I started to realize the seriousness of the situation. I looked back at the guy next door and suddenly understood. Rage surged through me. I grabbed her and threw her in front of the guy, hoping she'd repent. But minutes later, to my shock, she and the guy were chillingly dancing together like nothing had happened. Seeing that, I turned green with anger. I couldn't stand it. I swore to myself. They'd pay for this. So I smashed a glass bottle, ground down the bottom, glued it to the neck, softened a plastic bottle over a flame, cut it open and sealed the mouth with black rubber, made a makeshift diving mask. I couldn't wait and dove in. Underwater was clearer than I expected. Excited, I planned to spear a few big fish to spite them. But then I spotted a sunken dinghy. It only had a small hole. Fixable. My mind lit up. Repair that boat and I could get off this island. I abandoned the fishing idea, took off the goggles and started hauling the boat. Walking in water is brutal. Pulling a boat heavier than me nearly exhausted me. I gasped for air, kept going, terrified the tide would wash it away. Finally, I dragged the dinghy up onto shore. The I saw it and seemed to realize this might be our way out. He ran over to help, but I barked at him to stop. He'd humiliated me before. Now he had the nerve to cozy up to me. No way. For days I worked on the boat dreaming of leaving the island. Then my wife came to apologize saying she did what she did to survive and begging me to take her when the boat was ready. I wasn't stupid. I didn't buy her one sided excuse and turned away in anger. Not long after, the boat was fixed and even had a sale seeing the Guy busy. I grabbed my spear, planning to catch a few more fish for provisions. But as soon as I hit the water, I sensed something was wrong. I surfaced and saw they had already loaded all their stuff into the dinghy. They were trying to steal my boat. Fury boiled over. I sprinted to the shore, trying to stop them, but it was too late. They'd pushed the boat into the water. I chased after them but couldn't catch up and could only roar on the beach watching them sail away. My anger strangely shifted to amusement. I lay back in my chair, ready to watch the show.

But as soon as she surfaced, she saw a hundred dollar Bill floating on the water. Lisa couldn't believe it. She slowly moved closer and snatched the cash. But then she saw something even crazier. There were more hundred dollar bills up ahead. She was ecstatic. As she gathered the money, she looked around and spotted four black bags on the shore. Lisa's eyes lit up. Could they be full of money? She rushed over and unzipped one just to crack to see. The look on her face said it all. At a glance, it looked like 2 million per bag, a whopping $8 million total. She couldn't believe her luck. Not wanting her friends to find out, she quickly got dressed, planning to sneak the bags away in her kayak. Just then, her friend Leo popped out of nowhere asking where she was going. Feeling caught, Lisa had to spill the beans. He promised him a split and they were instantly on the same page. But just as they were about to leave, their third friend, Jack, walked up, seeing they were about to ditch him. Jack was pissed, so Lisa told him about the money and offered him a cut, too. But Jack wasn't having it. I'm not ruining my life for some dirty money, he said. He warned them to be careful, then took a cloth strip from one of the bags, tied it to his torn Backpack and walked off alone. Lisa and Leo didn't waste any time. They loaded the money into the kayak and started paddling toward town. But they hadn't gone far when they saw a bunch of tourists on the shore with two cops standing right there. Lisa panicked. Before she could even catch her breath, another tourist paddled right past them. A little later, they pulled over on a deserted shore to rest and Lisa made a shocking discovery. One of the four bags was gone. They were both stunned. They tied them together with a dead knot. How could one just vanish? Did they leave it back there? Lisa quickly called Jack and asked him to go take a look. But by now, Jack was already in trouble. He'd run into a stranger on the trail who turned out to be the owner of the money. Turns out a day earlier, a guy named Paul was making a getaway with a stash of cash in his plane. The plane malfunctioned, so he had to toss the money out and parachute down to find it. He'd been searching for a day and a night with no luck. But now he finally saw the yellow strap on the bag, the special marker he'd used. Paul recognized it instantly. Luckily, Jack was sharp. He knew that out here in the deep woods, this guy was bad news. So he just bolted. Paul was right on his heels. Jack was terrified to lighten his Load. He ripped off his backpack and threw it on the ground. And that's when the unthinkable happened.

The officers across from them were instantly terrified. The Beast then rapidly charged toward the group of police. Jack took the opportunity to quickly reunite with his wife. They saw the police were no match for the beast, so they hurried to run back into the house. But they were blocked by a police car. They could only hide behind the vehicle first, then continued searching for a way out. Who knew the giant beast would suddenly appear before them? But the beast didn't attack them. Instead, it charged toward the surviving officers. Soon, all the police were dead on the spot. Finally, the beast came before Jack. But Jack wasn't panicked at all. He raised his hands to stop the beast. However, strangely enough, the beast slowly calmed down, as if submitting to him.

But after the rapist was imprisoned, she made a decision that no one could understand. She wrote to the rapist asking to visit him in prison. However, the letter was rejected and returned. Seeing the unclaimed stamp on the letter, Miranda didn't give up. If the first letter wasn't received, she'd send a second one. If the second wasn't received, she would keep writing. She persisted, and eventually, after hundreds of rejected letters, the rapist finally accepted one of her letters and agreed to meet her in prison. The letter that was returned included the words, you win. It seemed that he was moved by her persistence. A year after the incident, Miranda finally met the man who violated her. She faced the man who had caused her so much pain. The man thought she had come to accuse him so he couldn't look her in the eye and kept apologizing. But what he didn't expect was that Miranda wasn't there to scold him. Instead, she asked him how life was in prison, like a wife concerned about her husband. This confused the man. What happened next was even more shocking. Miranda visited him every week, and each time she looked more attractive and sexy. They began talking about daily life in the past, and their relationship grew more and more ambiguous. The man never imagined that the victim would fall in love with him. He, being naive, soon fell in love. With Miranda as well. He promised he would reform in prison and try to get out early to make up for his past mistakes, to get out sooner. Even if he was bullied by other prisoners, he wouldn't fight back. What he didn't know was every time Miranda heard that he was being bullied in prison, she appeared worried. But deep down she felt a strange sense of pleasure. One day, the man told Miranda that he had been granted Parole and would soon be released from prison. Upon hearing this, Miranda was stunned. She never thought that a rapist could be released so soon. The man who ruined her life would receive so little punishment. She forced herself to smile and acted happy for him. She couldn't reveal any sign of weakness because her plan was just beginning.

After the incident, the command center immediately dispatched fighter jets to bomb the rebel hideout. But still several survivors were captured by the rebels. The rebels proposed a hostage exchange with the Russian army. At first, everything went smoothly, but after the exchange was completed, the hostage remained motionless. The silly realized that something was wrong. He went forward to check and found that a bomb had been installed on the hostage's body. The silly carefully helped him defuse the bomb. After removing the front fuse, he cut open the hostages clothes and successfully cut the rear fuse as well. The morning light went out. The silly asked the hostage to let go of the controller in his hand. But out of fear the hostage's hand wouldn't obey him, the silly slowly helped him put down the controller. Just when they thought they had accomplished their mission, the silly noticed that the timer behind him had not stopped. It turned out to be an impossible bomb. Silly held the bomb and let the hostage escape slowly. The hostage was so scared that he fled forward quickly. The silly held the bomb like this, his heart undisturbed, quietly waiting for that moment to come.

The hammer couldn't break open the iron door. The man carefully examined the oxygen cylinders in the cabinet. He used a wrench to open the valve at the bottom of the oxygen cylinder and tried to turn on the switch. To his surprise, there was still plenty of oxygen in the cylinder. This gave him hope. He immediately grabbed other parts and began assembling them. Before long, a complete set of oxyacetylene welding tools was assembled. Looking at the flames spurting from the welding torch, he thought he would definitely be able to open the door. But after the man used the oxyacetylene torch for a long time, the sturdy iron door only had its surface blackened. The steel inside hadn't melted at all. He took off his protective goggles and angrily grabbed the hammer. Charging at the cabinet, he smashed and kicked it to vent his emotions. After venting, the man slumped down by the door, falling into deep despair. He had been trapped here for three days now. His friend had never shown up. He could only wait here to die. Just then, he suddenly discovered a small hole in the smooth wall. Hope instantly ignited. He took off his shirt and hurriedly grabbed the hammer and chisel, making one last struggle. Unexpectedly, the seemingly thick concrete wall was much softer than he had imagined. In no time, the Small hole was smashed into a large hole. The man's heart was filled with wild joy. The speed of chiseling the wall became faster and faster. It looked like he would soon chisel through the wall and escape through the hole. At this moment, the rotten, stinking, dead rat in the room finally came in handy. The man picked up maggots from the rat's body, holding them in his hand like peanuts, then slap them into his mouth in one go. This provided precious energy for his body. After filling his stomach, he had more strength to chisel the wall. Soon he chiseled through the concrete and the rebar inside was exposed. Fortunately, these rebars were very thin and weren't really a problem. The man lit the oxygen acetylene torch and before long he had burned through all the rebars. Over the next two days, he endured hunger, sleeping when tired, and chiseling the wall when awake. With perseverance beyond ordinary imagination, he finally succeeded in chiseling through the wall. Looking at the light coming through the hole in the wall, the man was too excited to speak. He swung the hammer as fast as he could to make the hole bigger, then crawled out on all fours with wild joy. But the moment the man crawled out of the hole, the despair swallowed him again. Outside was another sealed room.

After her shower, she opened the door to find the thief holding a towel for her with a dagger. She wrapped herself in the towel and stepped out, the thief staring at her. She stumbled in the dining room and realized a stranger was in her home. She immediately turned and fled into the bedroom, slamming the door shut. She turned on her computer and used voice recognition to send a distress signal. The thief smashed the window with a chair and broke into the bedroom. She turned and fled toward the door, feeling her way along the wall until she reached the stairwell. The thief caught up in the stairwell. She was already running swiftly toward the first floor, feeling the railing. The thief pursued relentlessly behind her. She escaped to the ground floor, feeling her way along the safety netting until she reached the main street. She pleaded for help from passers by on the street. A man approached, showed his credentials to the crowd and began calming her. Seeing this, the thief had no choice but to temporarily abandon the chase. The man called for backup, then escorted her back to the apartment lobby. The thief entered through a side door, ushered her into the elevator. They were in cahoots all along. They returned to her apartment, demanding to know where her boyfriend had hidden the diamonds he'd embezzled. But she Knew nothing, she turned and fled to the rooftop terrace. The man approached and ripped the diamond necklace from her neck. Faced with interrogation, she changed tactics. First, she LED the thief to search the refrigerator in the dining room. Then she guided the man to inspect the potted plants on the terrace. The thief immediately sensed something was amiss. He picked up an ice cube. The diamond was inside. The man smashed every planter, finding no diamonds. The thief melted all the ice cubes with water, retrieving every diamond. He turned to see his accomplice stuffing items into his pockets. Thus, the two thieves turned on each other. After both suffered losses, she skillfully refroze the diamonds in water and hid them back in the refrigerator.

I smiled at him, but his face turned cold in an instant. What's so funny? Nothing. His movements were stiff and lifeless, without a trace of love. Worse than the wedding bed was the house he chose for us. And small and dull inside. The moment we stepped in, he started giving orders. He said I had to cook and clean every day. He warned me never to step into his study. He said he once published a textbook, that it made him a lot of money, and now he was working on a second one. I believed he was truly talented. When I offered to help organize his notes. Entirely unnecessary. To write, a man needs the three p's. Not now. Pencil, paper and peace. He refused immediately. He took me to the bedroom. He told me to learn how to iron his shirts. After seeing him off each morning, I was left with endless chores. It felt like being trapped in a cage. One day, I passed by a tennis court. I signed up for a class on a whim. That night at dinner, I told him about it. His face darkened instantly. Can I tell you that I've already spent all of my money on you? I bought you an entire house. I had no idea what I did wrong. He came home late that night without a single word of apology. He just went through the motions of being a Husband. A few days later, two men came knocking. They said my husband owed them a large sum of money. The house was about to be taken away. I told them he was about to release a new book, that it could cover the debt. Mr. Elephant has referenced the hordes of gold he made from his last textbook. Only trouble was, when we looked into it, it doesn't exist. It was never published. I rushed into the study. His so called manuscripts were nothing but meaningless papers. He had been lying from the very start. I packed my things in a hurry, ready to leave. Just as I reached the door, he came back. He grabbed my suitcase. I shouted, calling him a fraud. He snapped in anger and dragged me back inside. When I opened my eyes again, I had no idea how long had passed. I escaped the house and cleaned my wounds at a sink. People on the street just stared coldly. With nowhere else to go, I could only turn to my aunt for help.

The prisoners families also concealed items within the food they brought. These objects were hidden so secretly that even when the guards cut the food into small pieces and inspected them, they failed to find any abnormalities. After the visit ended, the man pretended to cough, quietly taking the tool out of his mouth and dropping it on the floor. His cellmate quickly picked it up and hid it. Soon, the guards brought the food and distributed it to the prisoners. When the guards relaxed their vigilance at night, the prisoners immediately began their operation. They took out the food delivered during the day and found gunpowder hidden within the layers of bread. They then assembled it and finally connected the fuse. Just like that, they constructed powerful bombs. The next day, the guards failed to notice that bombs had already been installed on the prison's iron doors. Even more unexpectedly, they also stuffed a timed bomb into the toilet. While using the bathroom, when all the prisoners gathered in the rooftop yard, their escape plan was about to begin. The duty guard walked into the toilet. Simultaneously with the sound of the explosion, the prisoners began their action. Because they had large numbers, they quickly subdued the guards on the rooftop. They then rapidly stripped off their prison uniforms and rushed downstairs to detonate the bombs they had installed earlier. Hearing the news, the Guards immediately rushed to provide support. However, the prisoners companions had already buried many explosives outside the prison, which slowed down the guards reinforcement speed. At this moment, the prisoners arrived at the laboratory.

Their mouths were connected to others buttocks. The length could even circle an entire soccer field. Not only did it save food, it was also more convenient for management. When the prisoners had served their full sentences and were released, there would be no abnormalities on their bodies, only some scars on their mouths. To ensure the body modifications went smoothly, I especially recruited a highly skilled surgeon. I anesthetized all the prisoners with a tranquillizer gun. At my command, the prisoners were taken into the operating room. Seeing my plan proceed smoothly, I danced for joy. As time passed, the surgeries also began to go smoothly. But a few prisoners had poor digestive systems and frequently had diarrhea. If they were placed in the middle, the people behind them would starve to death. To ensure the plan was foolproof, I directly killed those prisoners on the spot. That day, the governor came down to inspect. I took the governor to see my great masterpiece, a human centipede of over 100 people laid out right before us. This horrifying scene even left the governor in awe. To ensure the food supply has specifically placed the big fat man weighing 200 gin at the very front. Starting from what the first person ate, it cycled all the way to the last person. All of this was only the beginning because I had another version. This version was specially designed for death row inmates. Those prisoners had their hands and feet hacked off and were then connected together. I had expected the governor to praise me, but the governor actually yelled that I was inhumane. This dealt a severe blow to me emotionally. The surgeon responsible for the operation burst in, about to brag about his perfect masterpiece. Now, knowing I was in a rage, I killed him on the spot. I then pointed the gun at the secretary. Just as I was about to pull the trigger, the governor suddenly turned back. He changed his mind, thinking this was a very good method. I was overjoyed. I hugged the secretary. But the next second, I still picked up the handgun.

Only Thomas was extremely anxious, for he knew clearly that the appearance of these monsters, it meant a massacre would soon befall the entire mall. Suddenly, a scream came from a distance. A gun, he's gotta go. Everyone was instantly scared and fled in all directions, but the mall's doors were locked shut. At that moment, Thomas ran into the mall against the crowd. Sure enough, he saw a gangster reloading an M16. Then the gangster fired wildly at the surrounding people. He noticed his girlfriend was within the gangster's firing range. Thomas immediately pulled out his pistol, rushed forward to take down the gangster, but his shooting skills were too poor. Every shot missed the gangster by a hair. At the same time, those monsters suddenly surrounded him, trying to stop Thomas. At this life or death moment, Thomas broke free and shot the gangster dead with one bullet. After that, he walked tremblingly toward his girlfriend. The place was in a mess. The walls were covered with bullet holes. It wasn't until his girlfriend stood up safely that the two of them cried tears of joy. Suddenly, another phantom appeared out of nowhere. A woman across from him shouted for help. He realized the danger. Wasn't fully over yet, so he quickly followed the woman. Only then did he realize that this woman was the soul of someone who had just died.

He yanked his arm and the girl's bracelet snapped in half. She yelled that he went too far, but the man didn't apologize. Instead, he took out 2 yuan and handed it to her. The humiliation made her shake with anger. But what could a poor girl do to pay for college? She took on every job she could find, even working as a nanny for the rich. One day, while she was cleaning, a strange man walked into the house. She hid in the corner, terrified the and heard the noise and the two chased each other around the room until they bumped straight into each other. The billionaire instantly recognized her, the waitress who had talked back to him. Facing this tall, intimidating man, the girl begged him not to hurt her. Only when he said he was the homeowner did she finally calm down. He quickly explained she was the new cook and cleaner. The man looked puzzled but said she could stay as long as she stayed out of sight whenever he was home. Later, she told her best friend what happened. Her friend looked him up online and gasped. He wasn't just a billionaire, he was also single. The next day, she was busy in the kitchen again when a little boy suddenly appeared and scared her. He was the billionaire's nephew. The boy was playful and sweet and soon the two became Friends. They had a pillow fight, feathers flying everywhere, and even dragged the sofa outside to build a tent. When the billionaire came home, he found the house a total mess. He scolded her on the spot. The little boy ran to comfort her. Though uncle has a fiery temper, he's actually a really good person. Tears still glistened in the girl's eyes. Soon after, the billionaire told her to make dinner. She served a cheese salad, but he frowned and asked, who told you to change the menu? The boy jumped in and said, it's my favorite dish. The man sighed and didn't argue further. The boy begged his uncle to let her eat with them. She tried to refuse, saying she was working. But the billionaire, out of politeness, invited her to join. After dinner, the three sat in the yard watching a movie, laughing and playing a popcorn throwing game. Before going to the bathroom, the boy whispered to his uncle, don't bully her while I'm gone. Then he turned back again just to make sure the girl laughed, calling him adorable. The man said quietly, I was like that when I was a kid, she teased. Hard to believe you were ever cute. After she returns home, her best friend had gone to a bar, a bar known for trapping rich men. She rushed there with another friend and saw her bestie surrounded by drunk old guys. She stormed in, yelled at the men and dragged Her friend out. But that scene was witnessed by the wealthy man's friend. A friend relayed the incident to the wealthy man, leading him to mistakenly believe that the family's maid had designs on him.

I am a biology teacher. My daughter is in my class. One day I found that a boy in my class had sent her an adult video. I was furious and threw his phone out the window. Maybe he felt humiliated because the way he looked at me was full of hate. A few days later, on Valentine's Day, my daughter dressed up and went to a bar with her friends. It was getting late and she still hadn't come back. So I called her. She said she would be home in half an hour. And I felt a little relieved. But what I didn't know was that after hanging up, she was kidnapped by strangers. I waited for a long time, but she never came back. I couldn't reach her on the phone. So I went to the police station in panic to file a report. But the police didn't seem concerned at all. Seeing that the police did nothing, I had no choice but to go to the bar myself, but I still couldn't find her. The next day when I saw her again, she was barely alive. Over one night, my beautiful, innocent girl had become unrecognizable. What was even harder for me to accept was when the doctor told me, replay 1, what it means for a girl to be raped in India. As a mother, I understood it all too well. I called my husband in tears. My daughter survived and with courage beyond her ears, recorded a statement. The boys involved were arrested the same day. That arrest came the beginning of a different fight. My daughter testified on video in court, stripping herself of dignity to speak the truth while powerful forces moved behind the scenes. The judge was compromised and dismissed her testimony on the basis that she had been drunk that night. The four boys hired a formidable lawyer and after 38 days of legal battle, they were declared not guilty for lack of evidence. The verdict was a calculated injustice. My husband lost control and struck one of the boys in court. He was detained for assault. My mind went blank. My daughter remained in that bed, fragile, while the men responsible returned to their families as if nothing had happened. I'm so sorry about what has happened. When I saw one of those boys at school the next day, he carried himself with the arrogance of someone untouchable. Watching him thinking of my daughter and of the system that failed us, and I knew what I had to do. I decided to take revenge myself.

What, what does an 18 year old and a 5 year old have to talk about for three hours straight? I have to peek at the home surveillance footage every day. On this day, I suddenly noticed that my daughter was laughing very happily in the video. She chatted with the nanny for a long time. I curiously asked my daughter about it. She told me it was a secret. Having no other choice, I could only go ask the nanny. Her reply was very natural, but her eyes deliberately avoided mine. I started to suspect her, but I had no evidence. I could only buy a hidden camera to monitor her and my daughter's every moment. Time came to the day of my daughter's performance. The nanny considerably helped her change clothes and encouraged her. I even declined my boss's urgent work request and left work early. But just as I was on my way there, the police suddenly stopped me. I'm gonna need you to pop the trunk and step out of the car, man. What? Why step out of the car? It turned out the nanny had used the surveillance system to trigger a false alarm. By the time I finally cleared up the misunderstanding and rushed to the theater, the performance had long been over. I'm so sorry I, I couldn't get there in time. I can't believe you missed it. I'll go check on her. Hang on, hang on. I thought I told you that she was to play the violin tonight. It wasn't my decision. Missus Kessler, right? I vented all my anger on her and decided to talk to her parents. I used high tech means to locate her parents residence. But the moment I saw her mother, her panicked expression aroused my suspicion. I asked to see her childhood photos. Halfway through flipping through them, I sensed something was wrong. They simply didn't look like father and daughter. As I turned to leave, her mother chased after me. Don't bring her back here. Do you understand? Please, you need to protect her and take care of her. I never could. After returning home, I still decided to fire her. Why did you fire her? She was my best friend. I hate you. When my daughter heard the news, she lost control of her emotions and rushed upstairs. That night, I suddenly realized my daughter was missing. I frantically called the police. The police, however, told me the nanny had no birth records in the hospital's archives. She was only recorded as a Newborn abandoned by her parents. What hospital? Saint Anthony's in Wakefield. I stood frozen in place. I had abandoned a child there. It was a mistake I made when I was young. Realizing the severity of the situation, I rushed home and checked the surveillance footage. On the camera, I saw the nanny crawling out from under my daughter's bed. If you ever want To see your precious daughter again. You'll meet me at your husband's construction site. No police, no Mark, just you.

The next day, Teddy checked the news and found out the guy who died the night before was a young football player. There was a hidden curve right by their driveway and he couldn't hit the brakes in time, which cost him his life. Teddy felt really bad for the guy, but since the crash happened right outside his house, he figured he had a responsibility to do something about it. So he took a close look at that curve and noticed tons of old, worn skid marks on the pavement. Clearly, this wasn't the first accident there. To keep another tragedy from happening, Teddy used the lawn mower to clear out all the weeds along the road, making the warning sign that been hidden in the grass much more visible. Every night when he had nothing to do, he'd sit in the yard and keep a close eye on the road. But even that wasn't enough to stop another accident. One day, Teddy was grilling in the backyard when he heard a loud crash. He ran over and saw another Car had been in a terrible wreck. The driver still had a pulse, but Teddy had no clue how to perform first aid. By the time the police and ambulance arrived, the driver had already passed away. Teddy was consumed with guilt, blaming himself for not knowing any first aid skills, for letting the guy die right in front of him. He poured out his heartache to Brooke, saying if he'd been able to give the driver CPR right away, maybe he would have survived. But Brooke couldn't handle it anymore. She insisted they had to move out within a week. With accidents happening one after another, she thought the house was cursed. No wonder the previous owner had sold it at an absurdly low price. On top of that, their son kept saying he could smell a rotten stench in the house. Brooke was convinced it meant way too many tragedies had happened there and kids could pick up on that bloody stench. But Teddy refused to move. He was dead set on staying, determined to put an end to the tragedies once and for all.

She also hangs two sandbags around my neck. She doesn't do this to train my body. She does it to keep my secret from being discovered. Because ever since I was little, I've had a superpower no one else has. My body floats into the air whenever my emotions fluctuate. Since I can't control this power, my mom always keeps me by her side. Whenever she sees me start to float, she immediately pulls me back down. But having a power like this is dangerous, so we've been forced to live a secluded life. As time passed, I grew up, but I still couldn't control this ability. Whenever I saw a girl I liked, my feet would lift off the ground. I tried to calm myself down, but the bus suddenly jolted. I slammed into the window. The pain instantly broke my concentration, and my feet slowly returned to the floor. I thought it was just a random accident, but I didn't expect the new transfer student in class to be that same girl from the bus. When she greeted me, my calm heart started to race again. I gripped the desk tightly, muttering digits of pie under my breath. I didn't relax until everyone had left the classroom. But Anna hadn't gone far. Her clothes were soaked from the rain, and I couldn't take my eyes off her. I quickly grabbed a nearby railing, afraid my Secret would be exposed. But Anna didn't notice. She just walked past me with her backpack. The next morning, Anna barely brushed against me, and I shot straight into the air. She looked surprised, but class was about to start, so she didn't think much of it. However, she noticed the wound on my hand. After school, she came up to me and gently applied ointment to my hand. From then on, we started getting closer. We ate together and went to school together. My mom made pork cutlets. Her dad sold fried chicken. We had more and more to talk about. One day, Anna asked for my help. She had to do 100 sit UPS in under a minute. But being that close to her made my body float again. This time, I flew right over Anna's head. She was about to ask why that happened, but the janitor rushed in and kicked us out. After that, Anna couldn't stop thinking about it, so she decided to follow me. She traced my footprints to the school building. But when she reached the crossroads, the footprints suddenly disappeared.

But that day, Tony got stuck in traffic. Looking at my incomplete hands, I suddenly felt completely helpless. I didn't want my three years of hard work to go to waste. So I tried to flip open the paper with my mouth and bite the pen just to write my name. But no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't do it. When the exam ended, I was filled with despair. In a fit of hopelessness, I went straight to the rooftop. At that moment, I wanted to end my miserable life, because before the exam even started, when Tony still hadn't shown up, I tried asking strangers passing by for help, but not a single person was willing to lend a hand. In the end, I placed my last hope on the Proctor. But to my shock, even the teacher gave up on me. Now I no longer have the right to blame anyone. What made it worse was that the minister of the Interior's daughter decided to go shopping that day, so she used her father's power to block off the roads, which accidentally trapped Tony halfway. By the time Tony finally reached school, it was already too late. As he rushed desperately toward the rooftop, he heard the screams of the crowd. Below because I had chosen to end my life in this. Tony was devastated. At the same time, my brother also arrived. He had gotten my message asking for help, but he, too, was stuck in traffic. He had even asked a police officer by the roadside for help, but the officer's response left him heartbroken. And just like that, death separated me and my brother forever. But my brother wanted to seek justice for me, so he went straight to the police station to report the minister's daughter. Yet when the chief heard his words, he just gave a subtle signal to his men, quietly pass the message to the minister. Little did he know that same night, my brother was kidnapped by gangsters and brutally tortured to death. In this city, the minister's word was law. He wouldn't allow anyone to threaten his power. But there was one man who couldn't stand the evil, and that man was Tony.

I know. So how do you know when to lie? When people need to know things they need to know. If they don't lie to your teeth and feel good about it, you have cancer. Yeah, I know. After falling, Evan was taken to the hospital for examination. His face reminded Doctor Murphy of his late brother. Holding back his emotions, Murphy began the routine examination. When you fell, did you hit your head? What? You think I have brain damage. Stagnus can be a sign of a neurological issue. Well, that would explain the sea I got in social studies. Evans optimism and humor gradually merged with the image Murphy remembered. To be cautious. Murphy ordered a brain CT scan. I used to know a kid with autism. Peter used to know. You don't know him anymore. He died hit by a car. You know anyone who died? My brother. That sucks. When Murphy saw the shadow in Evan's brain, the grief nearly broke his composure. He immediately went to speak with Evan's parents. We already have an oncologist. The doctors at SFM gave him a year to live. That was seven months ago. Evan's parents begged Murphy to keep it secret. They just wanted their son to enjoy his final days in peace. But what they did not realize was that Evan had already sensed something was wrong. My parents took me in for a sore leg. The next day they bought me A PS, four kids don't get gaming systems for growing pains. Hey, it's okay. I'm not afraid to die. The case left Murphy sleepless night after night. To keep himself from being crushed by sorrow, he buried all his time into studying medical files. Evan doesn't have cancer. It might not be cancer. Fractured arm. Yes. According to theory, there is a possibility that Evans cancer was misdiagnosed. But this probability is far less than 1 in 1,000. It is possible, yes. But it means telling the parents of a dying child that there is hope when really there isn't. Still, Murphy could not let go of that faint hope. Risking his medical license, he decided to run the test on his own. No biggie. No biggie. You're lying. You might not do. My parents know. I was told not to get their hopes up. Let's do it before they get back.

You know your mama still has not called me? maybe she don't want to talk to you. She don't want nothing to do with you. It's alright. She'll come back around. Always does. In the meantime, how much that stuff I get from tiny cost? 200. At least you tell your mom that. If she don't wanna play no more, she owes me. I want 300 by Friday or I'm coming by and I leave. But I don't have that much money now. The next welfare payment is still days away. So I went to the pawn shop. I sold my mother's gold necklace and the digital camera my best friend lent me. I got $150 for them. Even though I was terrified of what that low life might do, I forced myself to go see him alone. I gave him the $300 back. Luckily, he still had some regard for my mother. He didn't cause trouble for me. But me showing up alone made him suspicious. Hey, spider, where is your mama? She claimed to let you come here all by yourself. You up to something, girl? Haha, I ain't done with you, spider. I ain't done with you. Scared, I ran home in a panic. I broke down in front of the box holding my mother. I hate you. A few days later, the welfare money arrived. I immediately went back to the pawn shop. I bought back the camera my friend had lent Me. But I didn't redeem my mother's gold necklace. Hey, what about the locket? Can't afford it. When I got home, my sister noticed our mother's necklace was gone. She was very upset when she found out I sold it. The syringes made her naively believe our mother was just sick, like with cancer. In my sister's eyes, our mother was heroic for taking care of us while being sick. But I shattered that illusion. I told her about the countless times strange men scared us at home, the countless times that horrible boyfriend hit us. That's not true. You're lying. Why would I lie about that? Cause you hate her and you want me to hate her, but I don't. My sister couldn't handle the truth. She ran frantically to the storage room to find our mother. Right then she had an asthma attack. She grabbed her inhaler, but after a few desperate puffs, she realized it was empty. By the time I found her, she had already collapsed unconscious. I grabbed the empty inhaler. When I pressed it, the horrible realization hit me. I had forgotten to refill her prescription. I ran back inside. I used her mother's phone to call for an ambulance, but it would take time to arrive. So despite the danger, I took my mother's car. I drove my sister to the hospital myself. At the E R. Entrance, this staff stop my frantic rush. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get Out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! I waited anxiously outside the emergency room. I was consumed by guilt. My carelessness had put my sister's life in danger. Soon, a hospital social worker came to speak with me. Hospital rules are strict. Without a parent or guardian's consent, they couldn't discuss my sister's condition with me. I begged them. I just needed to know if she was safe. But it was no use. There was nothing I could do. I could only curl up helplessly on the chair and wait.

Behind me is a sheer cliff. A fall would mean certain death. I grit my teeth, frowning, concentrating all my strength on my index finger, clutching the sand, not daring to move a muscle. But the sand is too soft. It can't support my weight. And soon I begin to slide. Panic. I quickly come up with an idea, spreading my legs wide, pressing my head to the ground for more friction, barely managing to stop myself. Just then, my phone rings from my backpack. The chance to call for help is right in front of me. I cautiously raise my right hand, but before I can reach my phone, my body slides down a lot more. I tremble, press flat to the ground. But I won't give up the chance to survive. After a moment of hesitation, I steady my breathing carefully, raise my left hand, reach for the backpack and slowly unzip it. Just as I'm about to grab the phone, I lose my balance, sliding quickly downward, I forced my arms and legs against the cliff and narrowly saved myself. Now I have nowhere to go. Above me, soft sand, below, high rocks. One wrong move and I'm dead for sure. Fear and helplessness spread through my body. Suddenly, an idea hits me. I begin to calculate the intervals between waves hitting the rocks. After a few checks, I find the right moment. I Turn around. I don't die from the fall, but the water is too shallow. My weight slams into a rock. Pain surges through me and I lose consciousness. Luckily, I regain awareness, quickly swim back to the surface and climb up the nearest rock. I've made it just barely. I'm overjoyed. My tense nerve is finally relaxing. But then I feel a sharp pain in my palm and realize my hand has been cut with a 10 centimeter long gash. It's a shocking sight, too gruesome to look at, but at least I'm still alive. After studying myself, I prepare to leave. But the moment I take a step, I crash hard onto the rocks and pass out. I don't know how long it's been, but the waves wake me. I try to move, but my legs are paralyzed. During the fall, my pelvis was crushed by the rocks and I'm slowly losing feeling in my feet. Then I remember my phone, but it's been ruined by the seawater, totally useless. I look helplessly at the sky calling out, but in this deserted sea, there's no response. I take off my shirt, bandage the wound and look around, searching for a way out. In the distance, an island is my only hope. I decide to take a chance, grab my bag and struggle toward the rocks. One quick roll, I dive back into the sea, dragging my half paralyzed body, using one arm to swim with all my might. Halfway There I feel a sharp pain in my abdomen, and suddenly I disappear below the surface. I instinctively scream, but my voice is lost in bubbles. Survival instincts keep me fighting, and finally, I break the surface again, but I'm exhausted, and the lack of oxygen knocks me out. This time, I have no strength left to fight. My body sinks slowly. My feet touch the seafloor.

Besides, she would ask Jack for some rewards. Whenever this happened, Jack would always close the office door with a remote control and then fool around with the secretary in the office for half an hour. However, just a few days earlier, Jack had been on the verge of firing Anna. The reason was that Anna, in her role as a secretary, was really clumsy and absent minded. She often messed up the tasks Jack assigned to her and even made mistakes in such simple things as buying a drink. This made Jack unable to bear it any longer, so he fired her directly. But that night, when Jack was organizing Anna's desk, he accidentally found some intimate photos he had left on her computer. And all these photos had even been taken in the office. This discovery made Jack's whole body heat up instantly. He had never seen Anna look so sensual before. So the next day when Anna was about to leave, Jack stopped her, apologize to her sincerely and begged her to continue being his secretary. Seeing the drastic change in Jack's attitude, Anna seemed to figure out the reason she decided to keep working for him and told him that if she made a mistake in the future, he could punish her as he pleased. But at That time, Jack still didn't understand what punishing her as he pleased meant. Only a few minutes later, Anna replaced the coffee Jack had asked for with hot water. Jack was very angry and was on the verge of deducting money from her salary. But what Jack didn't expect was that Anna, the provocative attitude, threw the cup to the ground. This left Jack quite surprised. But in the next moment, Anna lifted her hips and asked Jack to punish her. It was not until then that Jack finally understood what punishing her as he pleased really meant. So he punished her severely.

I told the doctor Anna throws up every single night. All her symptoms looked exactly like pregnancy, but the doctor just cut me off. He announced it was just a lactose allergy. Hearing this, my husband and I finally breathed. But I quickly realized Anna's condition wasn't that simple. That same night, I was jolted awake again by my daughter's piercing screams. Watching Anna writhe in agony broke our hearts. We rushed her to the hospital that night. After emergency treatment, Anna's condition finally stabilized. But the young doctor simply prescribed painkillers and sent us home. I begged him to examine her more thoroughly, but he insisted Anna just had acid reflux and would recover after a few days of rest. He said there was no need to take up emergency room resources for something like this. He started walking away. I grabbed him and pulled him back. Excuse me, out. This is not acid reflux. She's not lactose intolerant. There's something wrong with our little girl. This is beam. You need to calm down. No, you. You calm down. You find me another doctor. You run some more tests. I'm not leaving this hospital until I know what's wrong with my daughter. Seeing my determination, the doctor reluctantly agreed. The next morning he brought in the head of pediatrics. The director delivered devastating news. He diagnosed Anna with A serious intestinal blockage. Part of her uh intestines are twisted off. If we don't clear that obstruction right now, your daughter's gonna die. We're gonna need to take her right now. I'm sorry. I couldn't believe this condition was already threatening my daughter's life. A nurse pulled out a tube and asked my husband to help insert it through our child's nose. They needed to drain the food from her stomach before surgery could be performed. The process was excruciating for Anna. I thought after this treatment my daughter would recover. But during the surgery, the director found something way worse. Unfortunately, afraid than Annabelle appears to have a very severe intestinal motility disorder since the um, the intestines aren't able to function properly. What she eats and drinks times 2 World's simply the disease was extremely rare with no successful treatment cases on record. Learning our daughter had a terminal illness crushed us instantly. The director sympathized with our situation. He recommended a renowned pediatric specialist in Boston, but he warned us not to get our hopes up too high. So many people from across the country were trying to see him. Without an appointment, we wouldn't stand a chance. I refuse to give up this one opportunity. I frantically contacted the hospital, but my calls and emails went unanswered. The director managed to get us in touch with the hospital, but we had to wait on a standby list. So I have to wait for someone to Die and just pray that Anna doesn't go before then. Hearing this news left me utterly hopeless. All I could do was gaze helplessly at the sky, praying to god for my daughter's recovery. After returning from the hospital, Anna's life changed completely. She could no longer eat regular food and had to receive nutrients through the feeding tube every day. Each tube change was unbearable for her. Because of her illness, she missed the school trip to the aquarium. She stayed home all day, completely miserable. I felt we couldn't just sit around waiting to die. I'm taking her to Boston. We don't have an appointment yet. She's dying, Kevin. I can see it. I mean, I'm scared, too. Okay. We can't just take her to Boston without an appointment. Yes, I can. Seeing the pleading in my eyes, my husband stopped trying to dissuade me. The next day, I took Anna on a flight to Boston. After traveling over 1,000 miles, we finally reached the hospital, but without an appointment. We were turned away at the door. Sorry, ma'am, the doctor can't see you without an appointment. I'm not sure Anna can wait much longer. Out of nowhere, she just got sick and nobody knew what it was. And they told me, oh, she's lactose intolerant. She has acid reflux. It's an infection. And I knew it wasn't. I'm her mother and I knew. I just knew it was something bad. The nurse felt sorry for us as She looked at poor Anna, but as an intern, there was nothing she could do to help. I am so sorry. I wanna help you. I really do. But I've only had this job for two weeks, and I really need it. I'm, I'm just doing what I'm told.

As soon as the smell of blood spread, two big sharks reached there. Everyone on the boat got very excited to see this sight. But seeing the sharks from above was not enough for them. So the two sisters decided to go into a strong iron cage so that they could see the sharks up close. However, any such bold step often backfires. As the cage went down about 10 meters, a school of colorful small fish swam past them. The site was so beautiful that both the sisters became very happy. But just when they were about to capture this moment on camera, the camera slipped from their hand, and even after a lot of efforts, they could not catch it. But this incident did not scare them. Rather, he became more excited to see the shark swimming in the sea up close. Then suddenly, the steel rope slipped a little. The elder sister immediately became alert. She immediately asked the younger sister what happened. Then the younger sister said, nothing. Maybe the rope slipped a little. But the elder sister did not feel right. So she said to the younger sister, we should go up now. But as they started coming up, suddenly the steel rope broke. The iron cage went out of control and started falling down rapidly. And in just 10 seconds, it reached 20 meters down. Both the sisters held The cage tightly to avoid hitting the ground, but the rapid fall down made them unconscious. Both of them fell into the depths of the sea. After a long time, both the sisters opened their eyes with fear and panic. The younger sister immediately supported the elder one and calmed her down. Along with panic, the air in their oxygen tank was also running out fast. Only then they realized that they were now trapped at a depth of 47 meters in the sea. They neither got any sign of help, nor could they see any way out. Now they had to rely only on themselves, but they did not want to sit there and wait to die. So they, she removed the oxygen tank and tried to get out of the iron cage. But as she tried to get out, the mask got stuck to her head. But she kept trying to free herself even though a hungry shark was waiting for her outside. So like for part 2.

Part2 I #deathrow #execution #women #womenondeathrow #news #truecrime #crime #california","california,women,crime,deathrow,news,truecrime,execution,womenondeathrow","Carrie was the only one who did not cooperate with the detectives and decided to go to trial. And this is where she was found guilty of Irene's murder and the jury actually recommended the death sentence. She is currently 65 years old and is serving her death sentence at the Central California Women's Facility. And because she's in California, I don't think we will ever see her be executed. The last person I wanna talk about today is 55 year old Veronica Gonzales who has been serving a death sentence in California for the last 27 years. She was sentenced to death for the absolutely horrific torture and murder of her 4 year old niece Jenny Rohas. When I say absolutely horrific, some of the details of what they did to this little girl are by far the worst things that I have ever, ever read. I'm not going to go into exact details of what they did to her, not only because it's extremely graphic, but also because I don't even think there's time to talk about everything that they did to this girl. In 1995, four year old Jenny Rohas began living with her aunt and uncle Veronica and Ivan Gonzales. And this was after her mother had lost custody of her. Six other children also lived in this home with them. And the home was in absolutely deplorable conditions. There were cockroaches everywhere. There was no food in the house. None of the children had beds And all of the children had lice. While Jenny was living there, Veronica and Ivan began very brutally torturing and abusing her. She was frequently beaten, strangled, handcuffed and starved. They would burn her with a blow dryer or curling iron, burn her with boiling hot water, handcuff her and force her to sleep in a box. Just absolutely horrific, horrific things. On July 21st of 1995, they both forcefully submerged Jenny into a bathtub full of scalding hot water. Water temperature was 156 degrees Fahrenheit and was so extremely hot that it peeled the skin and the toenails off of the lower half of her body. She had severe burns to over 50% of her body to the point where several parts of her body was missing skin and she was even missing hair from her head. And I really want you to think about what I just said because after this happened, Veronica and Ivan let her sit there and suffer for six hours until she eventually stopped breathing and she died. When Jenny was brought to the hospital, they discovered that she had injuries to every single part of her body and they were in various stages of healing. So she had been abused for a while. There were so many injuries to this little 4 year old's body that it took up 10 pages of the court documents to just describe her injuries. Veronica and Ivan were immediately arrested following Jenny's death and they both went to Trial where they were found guilty of her murder and they were both sentenced to death. Ivan is currently 58 years old and is serving his death sentence at the California State Prison. Veronica is currently 55 years old and is serving her death sentence at the Central California Women's Facility and because she's in California I don't think we will ever see her be executed. I'm going to go ahead and end it there for time sake but please let me know if you guys want me to keep this series going and go over some more of the women on this list. Also please let me know if you guys like how I'm currently doing this. Right now I'm doing 3 women at a time because I like to give a little bit of details on the case but if you'd rather see a much more quicker breakdown so that I can cover more women in a video please let me know and I can try to change it up. But anyways, thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video.

Today we are talking about the cases of Cynthia Coffman, Kerry Dalton, and Veronica Gonzales. Part1 I #deathrow #execution #women #womenondeathrow #news #truecrime #crime #california","california,women,crime,deathrow,news,truecrime,execution,womenondeathrow","Did you know there are currently 2,100 men on death row but only 48 women? Let's do another video where we talk about some of these women that are on death row and what exactly they did to get there. Really quickly before I begin, all three of the women I'm talking about today are from California. And death row in California has been dismantled. So that means that all three of these women are still serving a death sentence. However, they are no longer on death row and they're just in general population in prison. The first person I want to talk about today is 63 year old Cynthia Kaufman who has been serving a death sentence in California for the last 35 years. And she was actually the very first woman to receive the death penalty in California since it was reinstated back in 1977. She was sentenced to death after her and her boyfriend kidnapped and murdered four different women over the span of two months back in 1986. Cynthia began dating a man who had just been released from jail by the name of James Marlowe. Quickly after they began dating, they began using drugs, they got married and then they started to commit very violent crimes together. From October to November of 1986, they kidnapped and murdered four different women. On October 11th of 1986, they killed 32 year old Sandra Neary and on October 28th they killed 35 year old Pamela Simmons. Then on November 7th they Killed 20 year old Corina Novis and on November 12 they killed 19 year old Lionel Murray. They were both arrested just two days after killing Lynell. And when Cynthia was brought in for questioning, she immediately confessed to everything. At first she tried to tell police that James was abusing her and she was too scared to leave him and that she did not participate in the murders of the four women. But while she was in prison, she ended up confessing to her cellmate that she was absolutely in love with James and she did participate with all of the murders. In 1989 and 1990, Cynthia and James both went to trial where they were both found guilty of the murders of all four women and they were both sentenced to death. James is currently 68 years old and is serving his death sentence at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility. Cynthia is currently 63 years old and is serving her death sentence at the Central California Women's Facility. And because she's in California, I don't think we will ever see her be executed. The next person on the list is 65 year old Carrie Dalton who has been serving a death sentence in California for the last 30 years. She was sentenced to death for the 1988 torture and murder of 23 year old Irene Melanie May. And still to this day Irene's body has never been found. On June 26 of 1988, Carrie and two other People, Cheryl Baker and Mark Tompkins were all together in a house with Irene. At some point, Carrie decided that Irene was a snitch and she eventually convinced both Mark and Cheryl that they all needed to kill her. Carrie decided that the best way to do this was to fill two syringes full of battery acid and then to inject Irene with those syringes. But when Irene wasn't immediately dying, they then began to be hit her over the head with a cast iron skillet and then they stabbed her several times. They then took her body and disposed of it. No one knows exactly how or what happened. And still to this day, her body has never been found. Both Mark and Cheryl cooperated with the detectives and told them everything that happened. And Mark Tomkins ended up pleading guilty to first degree murder and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Cheryl Baker pled guilty to second degree murder and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. And I believe by now both of them have been released.

She could only solve problems with her husband on the shelf. From then on, she didn't have to do anything except sit on the shelf for her husband's enjoyment. But after a while, her husband lost interest in her and even changed the orientation of the table where she worked. Three years later, the woman was alone in the empty house. She decides to escape, but the two meter high shelf is like 100 meter high platform for the woman. She carefully lies down on the shelf and then jumps off, eventually crashing to the ground. Since she hadn't walked for years, she could only stand up with difficulty. After breaking the shelf, she finally left the villa. She saw a cosmetics store down the block and re applied her makeup. The owner was so impressed by her makeup skills that he decided to hire her to work for him. Three years later, the woman developed her own business, but her job is still to sit on a shelf and share customers'admiration.

We always knew this day might come. This was the plan. Mama, am I supposed to pack all my clothes and books? Just your favorite things, Miha. For a nice, long visit. I'm going to meet my cousins. I heard. Look, Carmen, I know you're a proud woman, but you have to let us help you. We're family. I'm afraid if I let you go, I may never see Grace again. And you might not see one, either. At the very least, we can have a few more days with the girls. I'm not ready to say goodbye yet. It's too late for Hector. And as long as Carmen is here, she runs the risk of being deported, too. She either turns herself in, or I have to disappear. You said Carmen's at risk. What about Grace? She was born here. She's an American citizen. Wow. This is great. Waffles are my favorite. Good. You can have anytime you want. I wish I could live here all the time. Well, you never know. Might be a way we can make that happen.

Please continue, Mr. Hill. A white teacher is teaching black history to my son. What do you want me to do about it? You could have a black teacher teaching it. Or we could keep having Mr. Hill teach it. Because if you think about it, underpaying a white teacher to teach black history is almost reparation. Fine. Well, I can't do anything until I observe for myself. We all know how we have been taught to think about Martin Luther King Jr. And Malcolm X. But they were actually much more similar in their philosophies by the end of their lives than they were at the beginning. People said they didn't get along, but that's not true. Anybody else know anything about their real relationship? Animal soft philosophies towards the end? Oh, for real? For real. Why people wanted to pit them against each other. That is right, Paul. History is constantly being rewritten. That is why you need to question everything. You should even question me, a white teacher. You good? Totally fine. Ava has been in my last three classes. Either this is some time intensive prank or I'm getting fired for teaching black history. Please don't fire me. I can't get bad news while I'm eating. I have stress induced IBS. I found myself paying attention to your class. I'll never get through this. If you're looking at me, turn around. I'm going back to school. I'm enrolling in night courses and I might even get the credential. I'm supposed to have to work here. Wait, so I'm not getting fired? No, you're getting a raise. Paul and I were just discussing today's black history lesson, and I bet it was better considering Mr. Hill wasn't teaching it. Oh, he was teaching it, and he's gonna continue to. Don't judge him by the color of his skin, but by the content of his class. Wow. I just made that up. So you didn't listen to any of my concern? I found out in class that Jacob teaches about black historical figures all year, not just February. Did you just start paying attention this month? I didn't know that. Looks like we both Learned something today. See you later. What a shame. So hot, yet so very annoying.

We are completely discrediting energy density. But you're still off by a factor of 3.54, which would seem insignificant when examined closely. You realize that it's the square root of four times pi?

Well, I applaud the effort, young man. Don't treat me like a child. Treat me like a colleague. Fine. This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. How could you say that? What are you doing treating him like a colleague? Do you and your colleagues make each other run out of the room crying like that? Sometimes. But we run slower cause we're old. So, Sheldon, you and Doctor Stir just figure out your math emergency? I'd rather not talk about it. Me neither. That's probably for me. I'm really getting popular. Hey, Sheldon. Hello. You got that test problem sorted out? No, I'm afraid Doctor Sturgis and I are still in a math impasse. Uh, I hate those. Thank you for asking. I appreciate it. And how are you doing? Since when are you interested? My father told me I should be kind to old people. How old do you think I am? My father also told me if a woman ever asks you that, it's a trap. Smart man.

It slammed me into the wall. I watched the others succeed. I kept failing. I saw the disappointment in the teacher's eyes. I felt utterly insignificant. Humiliation, resentment. They flooded me. Anger lit up inside me. The teacher saw my potential. She told me inner beauty is the true beauty. She told me not to let anger consume me. That night, the teacher took the girls who failed the exam away. I followed secretly. I watched her turn. The three students into eels. She already knew I was behind her. She told me she only took away their control. They would provide energy for the academy. Like flowers. Their best purpose was to wither. Right after the teacher prepared to give me a flawless face, I stared at my ugly reflection. She told me to close my eyes. To imagine the most beautiful woman in the world. And then.

Hearing their cries, I quickly hid behind a rock. Moments later, a group of fierce hunters stormed out of the forest. They were chasing the unicorns. Terrified, I crouched in the water, trembling as the chaos unfolded. After half an hour, silence finally returned to the woods. The three unicorns had already been slain. Their precious horns were brutally hacked off. Having grown up in the forest, I was heartbroken. I lay across one of the fallen unicorns and whispered a prayer, grant me the power to find those who did this. Following the trail of blood, I embarked on a perilous journey. Three days later, I finally discovered the hunters hideout. To avoid alerting them, I left my mountain deep in the forest and slipped into the camp under cover of night. There I saw the hunters sorting through piles of priceless horns while others drove giant scorpions into cages. Disgusted by their cruelty, I was about to confront them when a sudden commotion erupted. A massive chariot rolled in and the self proclaimed emperor arrived. Everyone dropped to their knees in reverence. This tyrant was obsessed with watching gladiatorial fights between beasts and humans. And he had ordered the hunters to capture rare creatures for his entertainment. Their genes were then spliced into human subjects to create hybrids. One of these creatures, a lion headed guard, was the emperor's Favorite. I couldn't bear to see the beasts treated as playthings. That night under a moonless sky, I crept into the prison to free them, only to feel a sharp blade press against my back. You dare to take what dragon owns, no one can know the creatures of the forest. A fierce battle broke out. The white haired witch who attacked me looked frail, but she was a formidable fighter. A beast hybrid herself, I could barely hold my own. Our violent clash soon drew a crowd eager to see who would survive, the human or the hybrid. At the critical moment, my mount burst into the arena to rescue me. But before I could escape, the lion headed guard struck me, knocking me unconscious with a single blow. When I woke, I was bound hand and foot. The lion headed man tortured me with a red hot branding iron demanding answers. But my spirit remained unbreakable. The emperor, impressed by my resilience, decided I would make an excellent beast warrior. He ordered me transported in an iron cage to his fortress.

I bought the lakehouse from my parents in 2017. Paid 180 K cash. Full legal sale, my name on the deed. This place was everything to our family growing up. Every summer, my grandparents would invite us up for a week. Best memories of my childhood happened there. Then in 2016, my sister got accepted to her dream college. One of those big, prestigious schools. Everyone was celebrating. I was proud of her, too. A week later, my dad calls. Have you found a house yet? I've been saving since I was 20. My family knew I was actively looking. I told him, no, not yet. What about the lake house? We're thinking of selling. That hit me hard. Why would you sell it? Turns out my sister had no college savings. The scholarship she was counting on fell through, and my parents couldn't afford her tuition. I asked why she didn't just get student loans. We don't want her ruining her credit this young. So their solution was to sell the family lake house and use my money to finance her entire college experience. Four years, everything. I loved that house. After thinking it over, I agreed to buy it. I work remotely, so I got fiber internet installed and moved in permanently. Been there six years now. My girlfriend moved in last year. It's been Perfect. We've made it our own. Repainted, new furniture. It's not my parents house anymore. It's our home. My sister got engaged to her college boyfriend in 2,019. My parents agreed to pay for the wedding. Everything got pushed back and she rescheduled for this December. I even agreed to be in the bridal party. Then three weeks ago, she corners me at a family dinner. So where are you staying the two weeks after my wedding? I'm confused. Used. What do you mean? At my house. Her entire face changes. This sour look. That's not going to work. Why not? Because that's where we're having our honeymoon. Two weeks alone at the lakehouse. We need privacy. I actually laughed because I think she's joking. She's not. That's literally the first time hearing of this. Mom and dad said it was

I thought I had the perfect daughter. 17, straight A's, drama club, always home by curfew. Then my coworker Brian walked into the break room laughing at his phone. Just found my daughter's finsta. Kids think we're so stupid I froze her. What? Fake Instagram? Where they post the real stuff. That night I couldn't stop thinking about it. My daughter Hanine barely posted on Instagram. Maybe one photo a month. Sunset pictures, her cat. Boring stuff. But what if. So I made a fake account. I searched variations of her name. Nothing. Then I tried her nickname. There it was. A private account, thousands of followers. The profile picture was definitely her, just different. Heavy makeup, tongue out, making gestures I'd never seen her make. Bio made my stomach drop. Something about keeping secrets and living her real life. My perfect daughter. I sat there staring at the follow request button. What was I about to find? She accepted my follow request at 2:00am. I guess she didn't check profiles that carefully when she had thousands of followers. The first few posts seemed harmless enough. Group photos with friends at the mall, peace signs and duck faces. Typical teenage stuff. I kept scrolling back through time. Three weeks ago she posted screenshots from a dating app named hinge. Different guys profiles with ratings out of 10. This one's a 6 but has a boat, so maybe an 8? Definitely a 9. Look at those ABS! Comments from her friends ranking them too. My daughter wasn't even allowed to date yet. She told me boys were gross and tracking. A month back. Halloween planning posts. Her holding up different outfit options. The winner was something I can only describe as lingerie with cat ears. Caption read can't wait for the frat party at state. Going to be legendary. The comments were all fire emojis and guys saying things I won't repeat. The same weekend she told me she was going trick or treating. Her friend Sarah's little sister. I kept scrolling, each post making me feel sicker. Two months ago, a video. Her and three friends on top of a moving train. Actually on top of it. Surfing on a goddamn train while it moved through city. The camera shaking as they screamed and laughed. One girl almost slipping. My daughter, my baby girl. One wrong move from falling onto the tracks. The caption almost died, but totally worth it. 1,000 likes. Then things got darker. Posts from parties I didn't know existed. Red cups everywhere. Her eyes glazed, unfocused. Dancing on tables.

My mom clinked her fork against her glass and stood up. Before we sing Happy Birthday to my daughter, I want everyone to know we're also celebrating Moira's half birthday today. My 16 year old sister Moira bounced up from her chair and rushed to stand behind my birthday cake giggling. Another birthday stolen right in front of me. It's my 18th birthday, I said. Can I have just this one birthday for myself? Mom stared daggers at me. Don't be selfish. Birthdays are meant for sharing and we do this every year, dad added. Why are you suddenly making it a problem? But that was exactly the problem. Every year I had to deal with my parents putting Moira first. And sure it was cute back when Moira was 3 and I was 5. I mean, who wouldn't say all when you're top, their sister helps blow out your candles for the first time. But that was the thing. We were kids. But that cute incident didn't stop there. During Christmas, my parents let her tear open her gifts first before turning around and opening mine into. You're too old to be excited with opening presents anyway, mom said. I was 8. My 10th birthday dinner was at Chuck E. Cheese instead of the Japanese restaurant I wanted. All because Moira threw a tantrum about wanting pizza. My 12th birthday got cancelled when Moira woke up with a really Bad tummy ache, which happened to suddenly disappear an hour after telling everyone to show up. And on my 16th birthday, my parents forgot all about it. So this year was really it. I was an adult and didn't have to put up with their crap any longer. I look down at my birthday cake with Moira's name written beautifully and mine squeeze into the bottom corner in sloppy letters, completely misspelled and just lost it. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear. I blew out the candles right there, every single one before Moira could make her move. The singing instantly fell apart. Every person in the room went completely silent. What the heck, Moira shrieked. Why did you blow out my cake? Our cake, I said with a smile. I grabbed the presents my parents neatly wrapped on the side for my sister and ripped open the first box. AirPods. Wow. I've been asking for this for four years. Those are Moira's half birthday presents. Mom stood up so fast her chair scraped against the floor. Exactly. I can't wait to share it. I opened another box. Ooh, a Lululemon gift card. Thanks so much. I carefully opened the rest of my gifts, making snarky comments like, oh, Moira, this isn't the color Moira likes. Guess I'll just keep it for myself. You don't mind, right, Moira? All the guests stared at her. Moira started crying, real tears streaming down her face. She's ruining everything.

Used it for the LLC legal. Clean, quiet. Jenna's face turned red. Why would you do that behind our backs? It was for sale. I made an offer. We would have gotten so much more if we knew it was you, mom blurted there. It was not about legacy, not about grandma, about money. Funny, I replied. I got it below. Asking your realtor wasn't great. The rest of dinner was tense silence. Jenna stabbed at her food. Tyler kept checking his phone. Mom disappeared for 15 minutes. As I left, mom cornered me. You blindsided us. This family makes decisions together. I stopped. Hand on the door or knob. You mean you and dad make decisions? Jenna cheers. Tyler coasts, go along. That's not fair. What's not fair is telling me I wasn't in Grandma's will. Like I didn't matter to her. She flinched. I'll see you around. The next morning, the fallout started. Angry texts, passive aggressive calls, family members being fed half truths about my betrayal. But I wasn't done. While they spun damage control, I quietly dug into Grandma's actual will. But I found changed everything. The real will dated a month before she died, left the house to me, to my beloved grandson, Noah, who has always valued the history and heart of our family. They hidden it, filed an older version, forged documents and filed the wrong will. I hired a lawyer. We sued for fraud. The evidence was Overwhelming. Forged signatures, hidden trusts, covered paperwork. Six months later, we won everything. Court ruled the house rightfully mine, awarded damages and my parents paid restitution plus legal fees. Best part, I turned Grandma's house into a community center. Newspaper ran grandson honors grandmother's legacy. Despite family betrayal, family reputation crumbled overnight. Mom resigned from community council. Jenna's wedding business lost clients. Dad's deals fell through. Tyler texted, didn't know everything but should have. Sorry I didn't reply. It wasn't about apologies. It was about what they did when they thought I couldn't fight back. Today, Grandma's house, host book club memory nice. Her legacy lives no longer trapped by lies. Sometimes they drive by slowly, never stop. They chose darkness. Grandma's house stays lit.

Around 9:30 yesterday morning, police responded to a call from a young boy who said that everyone in his home was dead. Officers described it as nothing short of a massacre, with Jonathan shooting Lindsay, Ethan, Dylan and Lucas, but leaving his ten year old unharmed. Now, according to police, sometime overnight, Jonathan and Lindsay became involved in an altercation. Jonathan then, quote, armed himself with a gun, and he shot her several times. At that point, he reportedly started going through the house and systematically killing their children. There was actually just one child found in his bed, with investigators saying that they were hunted down and killed. Now, aside from that, we know investigators didn't find any signs of a struggle and that ultimately they found two bodies upstairs and two bodies downstairs. They say that why the young, the question wasn't killed remains a mystery, and that he was released to other family members at the scene. There were also no previous calls to the residents or reports of domestic violence. And it seems like everyone is wondering what happened. Lindsay Candy was known to be a wonderful mother, and 18 year old Dylan just graduated from the local high school last year. Ethan was a 9th grader there, and Lucas was a 6th grader at the intermediate school.

I was 14 when I discovered I was deathly allergic to shellfish. We were at a family barbecue when someone brought shrimp skewers. Three bites in, my throat started closing. My lips swelled. Hives erupted across my arms. My cousin noticed first. Your neck, she said. Look at your neck. Red welts were crawling up from my collar. When I tried to call for help, my voice came out as a raspy whisper. My aunt found me collapsed against the sink. She screamed for my parents. Mom took one look and said, hospital now. We piled into the car, me in the backseat trying to remember how to breathe. Each inhale felt like sucking air through a coffee stirrer. We were maybe two miles from the hospital when my 11 year old sister piped up, can we stop at Starbucks? There's one right here. My vision was blurring and she wanted a Frappuccino. Not now, sweetie, mom said. But her voice was gentle. Negotiable, please, my sister whined. We're literally passing it. I tried to object but could only wheeze. Dad glanced at me in the rearview mirror. We have time, he said. She's still conscious. Still conscious. Those were the words he used to justify pulling into the Starbucks drive through while I was dying in the backseat. The line had six cars. Two minutes became four. Four became seven. My sister Ordered a venti caramel ribbon crunch with extra whipped cream. Mom reminded her to say please. Meanwhile, I was clawing at my throat, trying to force air into lungs that were sealing shut. The woman at the window noticed me. Is she okay? Just car sick, dad lied smoothly. When we finally pulled away, I'd lost feeling in my fingertips. The world was going gray. My sister took a long sip. Thanks, daddy, she said. Nine more minutes to the hospital. I spent them convinced I was going to die listening to her slurp her Starbucks. We screeched into the er bay. Within seconds, nurses surrounded us. I heard someone yell for an Epipen. The epinephrine hit my system like a defibrillator. A doctor leaned over me. You got here just in time, she said. Another few minutes and we'd be having a very different conversation. Just in time. We would have been there 10 minutes earlier if not for the Starbucks stop. But everyone was so relieved I was alive that no one wanted to talk about it. Later, my parents sat beside my hospital bed. We're so glad you're okay, mom said. We were terrified. My sister stood in the corner, still clutching her cup. She wouldn't make eye contact. The next day, they retold the story to relatives. We rushed her to the hospital, dad said. Didn't waste a single second. That was eight years ago. I'm 22 now and I carry two Epipens everywhere. I've had Three more severe allergic reaction since then, each time I drove myself to the hospital.

But my daughter did something that made him turn pale. It was Thanksgiving at his parents house and I should have known better than to show up with store bought dinner rolls. For eight years of marriage to Derek, I had Learned that everything had to be perfect in front of his family or there would be consequences later. But I had been pulling 12 hour shifts at the hospital all week and barely had time to shower, let alone bake homemade bread. His mother, Patricia, made the first comment. As I set the plastic container on her perfectly set dining table, she lifted one roll with her manicured fingers like it might contaminate her entire meal. Well, she said loud enough for the entire room to hear. I suppose not everyone has time for family traditions anymore. 22 family members were crammed into that dining room. His parents, both brothers with their wives, six kids ranging from toddlers to teenagers, and various aunts and uncle who had driven in from neighboring towns. All of them turned to stare at me like I had committed some unforgivable sin. I forced a smile and explained that I had been working overtime at the hospital. Three nurses had called in sick with the flu and someone had to cover the emergency department. I thought they would understand. His father was a retired police officer. His Brothers worked construction. They knew about demanding jobs. But Derek's face was already turning that familiar shade of red that meant trouble was coming. His jaw clenched the way it always did when he thought I had embarrassed him. The vein in his temple started throbbing. You always have an excuse, he said, loudly enough to cut through every conversation in the room. The football game on TV suddenly seemed too loud. Someone's fork clinked against their plate. One of the toddlers asked for more juice, but nobody moved to help him. All eyes were on us now. I'm not making excuses, I said as calmly as I could manage. I'm explaining why I didn't have time to bake this week. That's when he hit me. The slap echoed through the dining room like a gunshot. My cheek exploded in pain, and I could taste blood where my teeth had cut the inside of my lip. The force of it knocked me sideways, and I had to grab the back of a chair to keep from falling. Complete silence fell over the room. Not one person moved. Not one person spoke. His father stared at his plate like it held the secrets of the universe. His mother suddenly developed an intense interest in folding and refolding her napkin. His brothers exchanged a quick glance, but immediately looked away. Even the children had gone completely quiet. Don't you ever embarrass me like that again, Derek hissed through clenched teeth. That's when My 16 year old daughter Chloe stood up from the kids table in the corner. She had been living with us for two years since her father died in a motorcycle accident. Derek had never liked her, always complained that she was too mouthy, too independent, too much like me for his taste. She walked over slowly, deliberately, pulling her phone out of her back pocket as she moved. When she reached where Derek was standing, she held it up and aimed it directly at his face. Smile, she said with this.

Allison, what did you put in these cookies? Long silence, only the sound of rain. Finally, she looked up, eyes red and swollen. Laxatives, she whispered. Strong laxatives, just enough that Kira would get sick before her swimming competition. She broke down crying. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What was I thinking? I placed my hand on her shoulder. I should have been furious, but I felt sadness more than anger. Why? Alison looked at me with tear filled eyes. Mom praises Kira constantly and tears Quinn down. Just like when we were kids. You were always praised. I was always criticized. Her voice grew stronger. Every Celebration of Kira's success highlights Quinn's failures. Just once I wanted her to experience setback, too. I was speechless. I never realized Alison's pain had grown this deep. Why did you call? I asked. So I regretted it from the moment I sent them. I couldn't believe what I'd done. I was going to warn you. She started crying again. But when you said Quinn ate them, I panicked. What kind of terrible mother am I? I took her hand. It was cold and shaking. Allison, how is Quinn really? He's suffering, she said. At school they call him the failure. Teachers say your cousin is so excellent. At home, mom says, why can't you be like Kira? My chest tightened. I never wanted to acknowledge how Kira's success Affected Quinn. I'm partly responsible, I admitted. I've ignored this for years. We sat in silence, two sisters facing a truth we buried for decades. I stood up and took the container, walked to the trash and threw the cookies away. How can you forgive what I tried to do, Alison asked. Forgiveness may not come immediately, I said, but I can try to understand. I pulled out my phone. We need to have a serious talk with mom about how her comparisons affect the children. Allison looked anxious. Do you think she'll listen? I don't know. But change won't happen without trying. Six months later, Quinn found his talent in photography. Sometimes it takes something bitter to reveal what's been poisoning you all along.

Three days later she called and asked did she eat the cookies? I laughed and said your kid came over and ate them all. The next thing I heard was her screaming through the phone. The package arrived on my daughter Kira's 12th birthday from my sister Alison, a basket of homemade chocolate chip cookies with a card, happy birthday, eat as many as you like. Allison hadn't come to the party, said she had to work. I opened the basket in the kitchen. The cookies looked odd, unevenly baked, strange color. When I brought one to my nose, there was a faint, unpleasant smell. My mother was standing behind me. Is that from Allison? I guess she couldn't afford a store bought cake. Something felt wrong. Kira had a swimming competition next week. I couldn't risk her getting sick. I place the basket on a high shelf and forgot about it. Three days later, my phone rang. Allison, Maggie, I have a question. Her voice sounded strange, almost cheerful. What is it? Did anyone eat the cookies? I glanced at the kitchen shelf. The basket was still there, untouched. Oh, your cookies. I kept my tone casual. Actually, your son Quinn came by earlier and ate them all. Silence on the other end. Then Allison screamed, Quinn, when? When? What has he done? Pure panic. This afternoon I lied smoothly. He stopped by after school, said he was hungry. I gave Him, the cookies. How many? How many did he eat? Her voice was trembling. All of them. Why is there a problem? I heard something drop on her end. Her breathing was irregular. Allison, are you okay? No, it's nothing. I just, I need to talk to Quinn. She was clearly agitated. Really? I pressed because he did seem a bit strange. After he finished, he said his stomach felt weird. Alison screamed again. Oh, my god, I'm coming over right now. The call ended. I stared at my phone. My suspicions had just been confirmed. There was something in those cookies, something meant for Kira. 20 minutes later, Allison burst through my door, face pale, eyes wide with fear. Quinn, where is he? Is he alright? We need to get him to the hospital. Calm down, Allison. I kept my voice gentle. Quinn. Quinn isn't here. She froze, stared at me, confused. What do you mean? You just said I lied, I said quietly. Quinn didn't come here. No one ate your cookies. I LED her to the kitchen and showed her the container. All six cookies untouched. Not a single one has been eaten.
