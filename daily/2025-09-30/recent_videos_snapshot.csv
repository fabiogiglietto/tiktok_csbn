So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together. I've been playing husband since year two. Paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent, while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down. Tears in her eyes, hand on her heart. Then some perfectly rehearsed excuse. We're not ready, let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal number five. And she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time. Convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere, and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it. When she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew. And she didn't even let me finish the speech. Just shook her head with this pitying smile. Like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke. Asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant. And the mask Came completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said, voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place? Eight years of building a life together. I was supposed to know my place? Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I'd spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. She didn't even notice until lunch, when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working. She texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said, I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic started. Creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night, acting extra sweet, made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said, kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

My sister called me a bad mom until her kid told me the truth. When Emma asked if she could dye her hair blue for her 13th birthday, I said, sure. It's just hair, right? She'd been begging me for weeks, showing me Pinterest photos of these gorgeous ocean blue highlights. At target, we picked out some semi permanent dye that would wash out in a month. She was so excited, she could barely sit still while I painted the streaks in our tiny bathroom. The next morning at breakfast, she kept flipping her hair and grinning at herself in the toaster reflection. I made her favorite blueberry pancakes, and she kept saying how the blue and her hair match the berries perfectly. It was honestly the happiest I'd seen her since her dad moved out last year. But when we showed up at my sister Beth's house for Sunday dinner, everything went sideways fast. Beth took one look at Emma, and her face just dropped. He pulled me into the kitchen while Emma was playing with her cousins and started going off about how irresponsible I was being. What kind of message does this send? She whispered harshly, gesturing toward the living room. She's going to look like some delinquent at school. I tried explaining it was just temporary hair dye, that Emma was still getting straight A's and playing violin, but Beth wouldn't hear it. She kept shaking her head and muttering about How I was clear really struggling as a single mom and needed to set better boundaries. The whole dinner was awkward after that, with Beth making passive aggressive comments about certain parenting choices every time Emma's hair caught the light. When we got home that night, Emma seemed deflated. She kept touching her hair and asking if I thought it looked stupid. I reassured her it looked amazing, but I could tell Beth's reaction had gotten to her. That's when I decided to call my mom to vent about the whole thing. Mom listened patiently while I ranted about Beth being judgmental. Then she got quiet for a moment. Honey, she said carefully, there's something you should probably know about your sister's situation. Apparently, Beth had been calling.

My college girlfriend's family owned half the restaurants in our city. Their house had more bathrooms than my apartment building had units. The first time I went to dinner there, I counted three different forks at my place. Setting in panic, her dad, Mr Richardson, made it clear from day one that I wasn't good enough for his daughter. What does your father do? He asked. During that first dinner, when I said he was a mechanic, the temperature in the room dropped 10 degrees. For months, I tried to fit in. I bought clothes I couldn't afford, Learned about wine I'd never drink again and pretended to understand their conversations about vacation homes and stock portfolios. I was drowning in debt just trying to keep up with their lifestyle. The breaking point came at Sarah's birthday party. Her parents threw this massive event at their country club. I showed up in my one good suit, feeling like a fraud among all the designer everything. Mr Richardson introduced me to his friends as Sarah's little project. That's when I snapped. I stopped trying to impress them. I started being myself again. The guy who worked two jobs, ate ramen for dinner and fixed his own car if they didn't like it. Tough. The weird thing, Sarah's younger brother, Marcus, started hanging around me more. He was 16, rebellious and clearly tired of his family's expectations while everyone else was networking. And name dropping, Marcus and I would sneak off to play video games in his room. One night, Marcus asked if I could teach him to change his car's oil. Dad just pays people to do everything, he said. I wanna actually know how stuff works. So we spent the weekend in my tiny garage getting our hands dirty and talking about real life. A few weeks later, Mr Richardson called me, not Sarah, me directly. I need to speak with you, he said in that cold voice I'd grown to hate.

The compensation was $800 plus a hotel voucher. This businessman in an expensive suit storms over and taps my shoulder. Hey, you should volunteer. I have a million dollar deal closing tomorrow. I politely told him I had an important interview and couldn't give up my seat. His face turned red. Do you know who I am? I fly first class every week. You look like you could use that $800 more than I need this hassle. I said no again and put my headphones back on. But he wouldn't let it go. He sits down right next to me. Listen, I'm trying to be nice here. That interview can be rescheduled. My deal can't. I told him he didn't know anything about my situation and asked him to leave me alone. He laughs and pulls out his phone. What company? I probably know the CEO. I. I can make one call and get you a better position. I ignored him completely and moved to a different seat across the gate area. He actually follows me and sits down again. You're making this harder than it needs to be. I'm offering to help you out here. Other passengers started noticing this guy literally following me around the gate area. He starts talking loudly to anyone who listen. Can you believe this? I offered to compensate him personally. And he's being completely unreasonable. A woman with kids nearby asked him to keep it down because he was being, he turns to her and says, ma'am, I'm trying to solve a problem here. Then he goes back to the gate agent and I hear him say, that guy over there refuses to volunteer. Can't you just bump him instead? The gate agent explains that's not how it works and they need actual volunteer. He storms back over to me with this entitled smirk, fine. The gate agent suggested I negotiate directly with passengers. I told him the gate agent definitely didn't say that and he was lying. His voice gets even louder. I've been flying for 20 years and I've never met someone so stubborn. Now half the gate is watching this spectacle he's creating. He pulls out his business card and waves it around. I'm a senior partner at Donaldson and Associates. Look it up. Nobody cared about his business card, but he kept waving it anyway. Then he starts approaching other passengers, asking if they'll volunteer and pointing at me saying, he won't do it, so maybe you will. This college kid tells him, dude, leave him alone. You volunteer if it's so important. Snapped back, I'm in first class. They can't bump me. It has to be someone from economy. The college kid laughs and says, then deal with it like everyone else. He's getting more aggressive now, pacing around the gate area and complaining loudly. To anyone who'll make eye contact. Then he pulls out his wallet. Fine, I'll give you 1,000 cash right now. Just take the voucher, I told him.

Scarlett and I had been together for years. I was planning to propose next month. Already had the ring and her dad's blessing. Then Ben texted her ex, who ghosted her after graduation to find himself in Thailand, left her crying with packed boxes two years ago. I think I need to explore this, he says, staring at her phone dreamily. Give him another chance. I owe it to myself. Four years of helping her through law school, her dad's heart attack, everything, and she wants to throw it away for someone who already abandoned her. Follow your heart, Scarlet, I said quietly. She looked shocked. You're not going to fight for me. You just told me you want your ex back. What's there to fight for? She met Ben Friday night at some trendy bar. Came home at 2:00am, makeup smeared, hair messy, reeking of his Cologne. We just talked. She lied to my face. Here's what Scarlett didn't know. Her best friend, Paige, had been crushing on me since day one. Told me drunk. At Scarlett's birthday last year, Paige texted, heard about Ben. You okay? She's basically dating him while I pay rent. That's garbage. You deserve better. Want dinner Thursday? Bella Court at 8. Bella? Court, Charlotte's obsession, her favourite restaurant where she Instagrammed every visit. She made her choice time. I made mine. Thursday came. Scarlett left to meet Ben. I picked up Paige, looking running in a black dress. We got Scarlett's usual corner table by the window. Halfway through appetizers, my phone exploded. Are you serious right now, Paige posted from bellacort. That's our place. How could you take my best friend there? I showed Paige the messages. She laughed and raised her wine glass to new beginnings. I got home at eleven PM to find Scarlett pacing the living room like a caged animal, practically wearing a path in the carpet. Ben was sprawled on my expensive leather couch scrolling his.

A few weeks ago, my best friend, Courtney, called me sobbing. I lost my baby Kate exactly 10 weeks ago. My stomach dropped. Courtney had miscarried four times now, all at precisely 10 weeks. I'm a nurse practitioner. That timing pattern doesn't occur naturally. I drove straight to her house where her husband, Joe answered looking exhausted. She's resting. This one hit her hard. I need to see her maybe tomorrow. Joe, I'm her best friend and I'm a nurse. Let me help. He reluctantly let me in. Courtney was in bed, pale and Huggy. When I hugged her, I noticed bruising on her inner arm, fresh needle marks, multiple injection sites. Courtney, these marks. She looked confused. I don't remember getting any shots. I just, I woke up with them after I blacked out last night. You blacked out? Joe interrupted us from the doorway. She faints sometimes, stress from the pregnancy. Three days later, Courtney was feeling better. We met for coffee. I've been thinking, she said. I never actually saw my regular OBGYN during any of my pregnancies. Joe always said he found better specialists. That seemed wrong. Doctor Holly, you've seen her for years. Joe said she was too busy. He'd take me to appointments, but I'd always feel so drowsy in the waiting room. He'd go in to talk to the doctor. While I rested in the car, I called Doctor Holly's office. That afternoon, pretending to be Courtney, checking on my records. I need to verify my appointment history for insurance. Miss Roberts, our records show you called to transfer your care elsewhere last year and the year before, always after positive pregnancy tests. That evening, Courtney texted me again. Found something weird. Joe keeps a detailed calendar in his phone. It has all my periods marked and there are red X's. Exactly 14 days after each period starts. Going back three years, 14 days after period starts is ovulation peak fertility. Courtney, does anything happen on the red X days? She thought about it. Around then is when Joe makes me tea. I guess he says it's good for sleep and fertility. I always take it because I'm usually tired and we want to start a family. I was so suspicious that the next day I came over the next day while Joe was at work. That's when Courtney showed me something else. I found this tiny safe in his closet, like the kind doctors use for medications, but it's locked. We tried every code we could think of, but nothing worked. Courtney, think those nights he gives you the tea. What happens after she went pale? I always wake up feeling sore down there, Joe says. We tried for a baby, but I never remember it. My stomach turned. He was drugging her and assaulting her on her fertile days to get her pregnant. Oh, my god. Could the miscarriages Be him, she shot out. I thought back to my medical training. Courtney, does anything weird happen before each miscarriage? Any sort of pattern? She thought about it for a while. Now that I think about it, I get really sick. Days before each one. Way more sick than usual. Her eyes went wide. Joe makes me soup, some special recipe he says helps with morning sickness. Every single time. Every time she yelled. He's insistent I eat it all. We went back to the safe. Courtney remembered something. His ex girlfriend's name was Marie. Her birthday was October 15th. The safe clicked open. Inside were vials of medications, two types, one labelled with a fertility drug code, the other.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggs bells around her mood swings. Year 1 was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids'grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I've forgotten how To enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and be being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Ellen's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Ellen gasp from in the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for.

So my wife Emma came home last Tuesday with that look on her face. You know, the one all guilty and nervous, like she just got caught stealing candy. She sat me down on our ratty old couch and started crying before she even said anything. Turns out she'd been hooking up with her coworker Jake for, like, three months. Three months while I was working double shifts at the warehouse to save up for our anniversary trip to Florida. She kept saying sorry over and over, begging me not to leave her, promising she'd cut all contact with this guy. I just sat there staring at our wedding photo on the coffee table. The one where we're both laughing because my cousin Rick photobombed us making bunny ears. He looked so happy. So stupid. Emma grabbed my hands and asked if I could ever forgive her. And here's where I became a complete psychopath. I looked her dead in the eyes and said yes. I told her we could work through this, that our marriage was stronger than one mistake. All that bullshit you see in movies. But I was lying through my teeth. The next morning, I called in sick to work and drove straight to Jake's apartment. Found his address through Emma's Instagram. She tagged him at some restaurant last month. Dude answered the door in his boxers, looking all confused. I introduced myself as Emma's husband, and Watched his face go white. Then I very calmly explained that I knew everything and that he had exactly 24 hours to quit his job and move out of town or I'd be paying visits to his parents, his ex girlfriend Sarah, who he was apparently trying to win back, and his boss, who definitely didn't know he was screwing around with married co workers. Jake started stuttering about how sorry he was, how it meant nothing. I just smiled and handed him a printed email I'd already drafted to his entire office explaining the situation. Told him this would be sent if he wasn't gone by Thursday. Me meanwhile, at home, I was being the perfect forgiveness husband. Made Emma her favorite pasta dinner, bought her flowers, even suggested couple therapy. She was so relieved and grateful. Kept telling me how lucky she was to have such an understanding Husband. Thursday came and Jake was gone. Just like that. Emma came home from work all confused because apparently he'd quit without notice and moved back to Ohio or something. She kept asking why he just disappear like that. I waited exactly one more week. Let her think we were rebuilding our trust. Then last Friday, I casually mentioned over breakfast that I changed my mind about the whole forgiveness thing. Her face went from confused to terrified in about two seconds. I told her I'd known.

Her boyfriend is so mysterious and she's obsessed with him. Meanwhile, you texted me 12 times about being nervous for your presentation. The way she said it made me feel like I was some kind of burden. I wish you were more mysterious, more of a challenge. I should have known this would end badly when three weeks later she'd be crying at my door. But that night I just felt hurt and said, fine, I'll be mysterious that night. I usually would have texted her goodnight, but I didn't and it felt wrong not doing it. She sent me three question marks right away and I just wrote back, all good and left it at that. Saturday morning came and normally I text her about my coffee and ask what she was up to, but I kept my phone in my pocket. By noon, she was texting you okay and I just sent a thumbs up, which killed me because I actually wanted to talk to her. Monday was the worst because I got the promotion I've been working for and all I wanted was to call her and celebrate. When we went to dinner that night, She asked about my day and I just said same old while scrolling through my phone even though inside I was bursting to tell her. She leaned across the table trying to figure out what was going on with me. You seem different, she said. Good, different. And the crazy part was she seemed more into me than she had in months, which made me feel powerful but also completely hollow inside. The second week, she started showing up at my place without calling first and cooking these fancy dinners, basically doing anything to crack me open. I can't figure you out anymore, she said. Wednesday night and she sounded excited about it. Britney so jealous. She as I got the mysterious boyfriend Jackpot. I wanted to tell her how dumb this whole thing was and how much I missed just talking to her normally, but I just shrugged and kept watching TV. my dad called because my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery and he was freaking out. I spent three hours calming him down while just sat next to me trying to figure out what was happening. After I hung up, she asked, is everything okay? And I wanted to fall into her arms and tell her everything, family, stuff. I said instead, it's handled. She killed me harder than she had in months and whispered, you're so strong. But I wasn't strong at all. I was just pretending. The third, Thursday night at eleven, PM Jess showed up at my door with her makeup running down her face, shaking.

And I owe $4,200 in back taxes. As if I don't pay immediately with gift cards, the police will arrest me within an hour. Now, here's the thing. I literally just got my tax refund two weeks ago. My accountant, Beth, handled everything perfectly, and I even got money back. So I knew this dude was full of it. But instead of hanging up, something clicked in my brain. My neighbour, Missus Kim, had fallen for this exact scam last month and lost $800. Time for payback. I started crying into the phone. Oh, no, I can't go to jail. My kids need me. The scammer ate it up. He told me to go to target and buy iTunes gift cards worth $2,000 as a first payment. I said I needed an hour to get the money together. First. I called my cousin Jake, who's a cop, told him what was happening, and he said to keep the guy on the line as long as possible. And I started my revenge tour. I called the scammer back an hour later, sobbing. I'm at target, but I'm so confused. Which gift cards do I buy? He walked me through it step by step. I pretended to be This helpless single mom who didn't understand technology. Sorry, can you repeat that? My hands are shaking so bad. For the next 20 minutes, I wandered around target asking him questions. Do I need the physical cards or the digital ones? Cashier is asking for I D. Is that normal? Sorry, my 4 year old is having a meltdown in the cart. Finally, I told him I had the cards. He was so excited. Probably thinking about his commission. I read him the first number.

She returned 6 years later to find I'd divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and, and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor role. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three Years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we. I watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for.

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother, so one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his work bench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice. And I apologized over and over. I, I promised I would talk to him, but deep down, I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, I said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

I didn't know guys will just stand in the shower for 10 minutes doing nothing, no water running, just standing there like they're waiting for a download to finish. The first time I walked in on it, I thought something was wrong. He looked at me all calm and said, I'm just mentally preparing. I've never looked at showers the same way. 2. I found out men treat fridges like treasure hunts. He'll open it five times in a row, stare like something new is going to spawn, sigh dramatically, and then eat plain cheese straight from the block. I once asked why he keeps checking. He said in case a snack magically appears. Three, I didn't know guys hum to themselves during the most random tasks. My boyfriend will be cleaning the sink humming what sounds like boss battle music, then suddenly switched to singing about how this sponge is my sword. I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said, but it still smells like me so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said, because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6, 10. They make sound effects for everything, opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7, they'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8, they'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes. And apparently that's normal to them. 9, they'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car, groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10, they can sit in total silence for an hour staring at the wall. And when you ask what they're thinking about, they say nothing. And somehow they really mean nothing.

I said, okay, but we need a roommate agreement. She laughed and signed it. She stopped laughing when she got the Bill. Brienne and I had been together for three years, living together for two. I paid 70% of everything because I made more as a software developer while she was a junior graphic designer. Then she started working late with her new mentor, Colton from marketing. Three weeks ago, she sat me down. I need space, find myself. We should take a relationship break but stay roommates. It's practical and mature. You want to break up but keep living together? It's not breaking up. It's a pause. We stay friends, keep the apartment, and see where things go. Naturally. Translation she wanted to test Drive Colton while keeping her safety net. Okay, I said, but if we're not partners, we're roommates. We need a formal agreement. She laughed. You're such a dork. Fine, whatever makes you feel better. That evening, I drafted a comprehensive roommate agreement. Fifth 50 split on all expenses, separate groceries, guest policies, 30 day notice for moving out, no overnight guests more than two nights per week. The next morning, Brian barely glanced at it. This is so extra, she said, signing with a flourish. Thursday morning, I moved to the spare room. By evening, I'd calculated her half of rent, $1,100, utilities $127, and separated groceries with labels. I left the invoice Friday. Morning. Due by the first for our agreement. She found it after her work dinner at eleven PM. What the hell is this? Your half of expenses. The agreement we signed. I thought you were being dramatic. You literally signed it. But you've always paid more. That was when you were my girlfriend. Now you're my roommate. Her face went through 17 emotions. I can't afford $1,227. Maybe you should have thought about that before suggesting we become roommates. Twenty minutes later, I heard her on the phone. He's being such a child. I'll. No, I can totally crash at your place. What do you mean? Your roommate wouldn't be cool with that. Guess Colton's living situation wasn't as available as she thought. She tried guilt first. Maybe dinner. Lit candles, wore my favorite dress. I miss us. I'm respecting your need for space as roommates. When that failed, she tried warfare. Forgot to transfer rent, claiming her banking app was glitching. Started using my expensive shampoo until I moved it. She complained I was being pet. I pointed to Section 3.2. Personal items remain separate. She invited Colton over every night. They blast TV, order takeout, leave boxes everywhere, make obvious noises. I documented everything. Her mom called. You're being financially abusive. How so? Making her pay half when you make more. She wanted to be roommates. Roommates split costs equally. You're supposed to take care of her. She literally asked for this arrangement. Click. Friday night wine night. With her friends got loud. I can't believe he's making you pay half. So toxic men are threatened by independent women. Then Brianne said the magic words. When the lease renews in three weeks, I'm telling him I'm not resigning unless things go back to how they were. He can't afford this place alone. He'll cave. I started apartment hunting that night.

My boyfriend Nathan told me this while we were getting ready for his company holiday party. Tonight we need to act like we're not together, he said while messing with his watch. I stopped putting on my makeup and look at him. What? Just don't tell anyone you're my girlfriend. Don't hold my hand. Don't stand near me. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. We've been together for two years. He let out this annoyed sigh like I was being ridiculous. My boss only promotes single guys. He thinks relationships make you weak, less focused. I've been telling him I'm single since I started gunning for this promotion three months ago. I felt my stomach drop. Three months of lying about me, he said. Everyone brings plus 1 so it would look weird if he came alone. But I had to pretend to be someone from his apartment building. The promotion decision was Monday. I looked at him in the mirror and felt something shift inside me. I put on my earrings real slow. Okay, Nathan, whatever you need. Second we got there, Nathan walked in way ahead of me like he didn't even know me. I headed straight to the bar where his coworker Brian was getting a drink. I don't think we've met, Brian said with a friendly smile. I'm Nathan's neighbour from his building. It was the cover story Nathan wanted. Brian smiled bigger. And got me a drink. We were talking for about 20 minutes when he asked, are you seeing anyone? I looked over at Nathan, who was pretending I didn't exist. No, I'm single. Brian's whole face lit up. Wanna meet my buddy Louise from accounting? He waved over a guy from across the room. Louise was actually really charming and kept touching my arm while we talked. Nathan showed up at the bar acting like he just needed a drink. Nathan, meet this gorgeous woman who lives in your building. Louis was excited. Nathan had to shake my hand like we were complete strangers. Nice to meet you, he said. And I could hear how mad he was. You too, I said back. Louis jumped right back in. I was just about to get her number. He handed me his phone. I typed my number in while Nathan stood there, his jaw clenching. About 10 minutes later, Nathan's boss came over to our group. Who's this lovely lady, he asked with this big smile. She's single and lives in Nathan's building, Louis announced, looking pretty proud of himself. The boss's eyes got all bright. Nathan, you seeing this while you're focused on work, Louis is out here meeting beautiful women from your own building. Nathan forced out this fake laugh. His boss kept going, though, this is what I mean. You stay single, you stay hungry. Relationships kill ambition. No offence. He turned to me when he said that last Part none taken. I agree completely. I was looking right at Nathan when I said it. The boss just wouldn't stop. Nathan, here is my best example. Three months without a single date. That's dedication. That's why he's getting promoted. Monday, everyone raised their glasses to toast Nathan's promotion. I raised mine, too. To staying single, I said, staring straight at Nathan. His hand was literally shaking when he took a drink. Luise asked me to dance after that. While we were on the dance.

I was halfway through Saturday morning spin at Cycle Soul, clenching to keep my tampon inside of me when I noticed the blonde girl in front of me facetiming. My boyfriend of four years. Can't wait to see you tonight, beautiful, he whispered. I vomited in my mouth. I can't believe we've been dating for three months already. She responded like, hello, Brittany, our instructor who always wore the cutest sets. Me crying, and immediately cut her playlist. Hey, hon, are you doing okay? That's my man. I pointed at the screen where Blake was now shirtless, making breakfast. The entire studio went silent. Twenty five girls in coordinating workout sets, just staring. The blonde girl immediately hung up and turned around. Wait, girl, I'm so sorry. I swear I didn't know. Every single girl started climbing off their bikes. Someone handed me a liquid IV. Someone else had tissues, the good ones with lotion. Another girl was already fixing my mascara with her emergency makeup kit. Four years! Natalie shrieked. This absolute trash man has been with her for four years. The blonde Isabella looked like she was gonna throw up her green juice. I met him on Bumble, and he said he just got out of something casual. Casual? The entire room erupted. They found his Instagram and followed in seconds. The most recent photo was literally a picture of us holding hands by the beach with the caption L O M L. This absolute queen with sleeve tattoos and perfect winged liner just said, call his sister. Speaker now. My hands were shaking as I found Ellie's contact. She spoke first. Hey, babe, how's been? Did you try that new protein smoothie place? After Ellie, my voice cracked. Blake's facetiming another girl. They've been together for three months. The silence was louder than when a boy starts showing you his camera roll on the first date. Girl, don't play. Are you being effing for real right now? I turned on Facetime and showed myself crying my eyes out. And that's when she started shouting, I'm getting my mom and we're coming right now! Don't effing move! She hung up, and I just stared at my phone like, okay, Ellie kinda ate. Oh, this is about to be good, someone whispered. Isabella and I were clutching each other's hands, neither of us blaming each other. The entire class was hyping me up and telling me I deserve better. The teenager in the corner came up to me and said, girl, even while crying, your skin is glowing. Let that crusty man go back to picking girls who are actually in his league. The class leader, Bethany, shouted, your hot girl era starts now! Even the quiet girl said, girl, you were really gonna give that receding hairline your best years. That one made me laugh. And y'all, when that door flew open, it was like Real Housewives met Crazy Rich Asians. Ellie strutted in with her Balenciaga bag. Mrs. A leak and her Saturday Costco fit, but make it fashion. Her Aunt Linda, who I didn't even know was coming, had her Cartier sunglasses on indoors. Where is she? Mrs. Lee's voice could have cut diamonds. She saw me. Saw Isabella. I watched her perfectly microbladed brows go through the five stages of grief in real time. Ellie, call your brother now! Mom, maybe we should. Now.

My best friend Vanessa has been dead for three years, but I still text her phone every single day. It started the week after her funeral. I was completely wrecked, barely functional. Vanessa and I had been inseparable since middle school. She was the sister I never had. We talked every day for 12 years straight. The night after we buried her, I was drunk on cheap wine and scrolling through our old text conversations without thinking. I typed, I can't believe you're gone and hit send to her number. My phone buzzed immediately. Who is this? I froze. Someone else had her number now. I quickly explained about Vanessa, how she'd passed away in a car accident, how I texted without thinking. The response came 20 minutes later. I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm Aaron. If texting this number helps you grieve, please don't stop because of me. So I didn't stop. Every morning at 7:00am, exactly when Vanessa and I used to exchange our daily good morning beautiful texts, I'd send updates to her number. Got the promotion at work today. You always said I'd make manager before 25. Went on another terrible tinder date. Remember how you used to screen my matches? Mom's asking when I'm bringing someone home for Christmas again. Wish you were here to be my girlfriend. Like senior year, Aaron never responded to these messages for two years. I just sent them into the void. Treating It like my personal diary. Sometimes I'd send photos of sunsets or my coffee, things Vanessa would have loved. I told that number about every breakup, every family fight, every small victory. My other friends thought I was crazy when they found out it's been two years. They'd say you need to move on. But they didn't understand those daily texts were the only thing keeping me connected to her. Then last month, everything fell apart at one.

I was a court reporter when a seven year old had a meltdown during his parents custody hearing, and their reactions revealed everything the judge needed to know. The Hendersons have been fighting over custody of little Nathan for six months. Mom Susan arrived in a sharp business suit with her attorney, talking loudly about her promotion and new condo. Dad Tom looked tired in his work clothes, having come straight from his construction job to make the two PM hearing. Susan's case seems strong. Higher income, stable housing, private school enrollment. Already arranged. Your honor, I can provide Nathan with opportunities his father simply cannot afford. Piano lessons, tutoring, summer camps. Tom's lawyer did his best, but the numbers didn't lie. Tom works long hours for half Susan's salary and lived in a modest apartment. When asked about extracurriculars, Tom quietly said, I help with his homework every night and we go to the park on weekends. Midway through Susan's testimony about her comprehensive parenting plan, Nathan started fidgeting in the gallery where he'd been sitting with a social worker. The seven year old had been silent for an hour, but suddenly stood up and said loudly, I need to use the bathroom. The social worker started to get up, but before she could react, both parents moved. What happened next lasted maybe 10 seconds, but it changed everything. Susan snapped, Nathan, sit down. We're in the middle of Something important. You should have gone before we came in here. She didn't even turn around fully, just shot him an annoyed look over her shoulder. Tom immediately stood up, walked over to Nathan, and knelt down to his eye level. Hey, buddy, of course you can go. Let's go right now. He took Nathan's hand naturally, like he'd done it a thousand times. I don't want to interrupt the important meeting, Nathan whispered, clearly anxious. You're not interrupting anything, Tom said softly. You're the most important thing here. As they walked toward the door, Nathan suddenly stopped and burst into tears. Not bathroom urgency tears. The big, overwhelming sobs of a stressed seven year old who'd been holding it together too long. Susan's reaction was to look at her watch and whisper urgently to her lawyer about the delay. She kept glancing at the door like their son's breakdown was an inconvenience to her testimony. Tom just picked Nathan up and held him, not caring that his son's tears were soaking his work shirt. He didn't try to stop the crying or rush him through it. He just stood there, rubbing his back, whispering, it's okay, buddy. Take your time. When Nathan finally calmed down enough to whisper something in his dad's ear, Tom nodded and carried him back into the courtroom. Your honor, Nathan would like to tell you something, if that's okay. The judge A mother herself, not a judge.

So I'm going through this absolutely soul crushing breakup with my boyfriend of three years. You know, the kind where you can't eat, can't sleep and your friends are tired of hearing about it. I start going to this 24 hour diner at like 2:00am because I literally cannot sleep. It's one of those old school places with cracked vinyl booths and fluorescent lights that make everyone look dead. First night I order coffee and pancakes and just sit there scrolling through my ex's Instagram like the masochist I am. The waitress, this woman in her 50s with kind eyes just keeps refilling my coffee without saying anything. Second night, same thing. Third night she finally asks, rough patch, honey? I nod and try not to cry into my syrup. By the end of week two, I'm there every single night at exactly 2:00am. Same booth, same order, same pathetic scrolling routine. That's when she sits down across from me. Alright, sweetie, you've been here 14 nights straight. Crying into pancakes. What his name? And I just break. I tell her everything, how he cheated, how he moved in with her immediately, how all our mutual friends picked sides. She listens to every word while bringing me free pie. The next night she introduces me to the cook. This is pancake Girl. She's having serious boy troubles. Hank, this massive guy with tattoo sleeves looks at me and goes, what? Kind of idiot breaks a heart like that. Then he makes me these incredible chocolate chip pancakes shaped like a heart. Soon the whole night shift knows my business. There's Madison, the other waitress who gives me brutal but honest dating advice. Cameron, the dishwasher who barely speaks English but always pats my shoulder and says no cry. Mija. Even the manager, Frederick, starts checking on me. They give me a nickname, Pancake Girl. There's actually a coffee mug behind the counter with HG written on it and Sharpie. That's mine now. One night I'm telling Madison about how my ex posted vacation photos with his new girlfriend and she gets this e evil smile. Honey, you know what tonight's pancakes are on the house. Hank's making you the forget that loser special. It's a stack of pancakes with you deserve better written in whipped cream. Week 3, they start giving me relationship homework. Tomorrow night you're deleting his number, says Madison. We'll watch you do it. Week 4, they make me change my relationship status on Facebook. Right there at the table, more cheering. By week 5, they're basically running a late night therapy session. The customers start joining our conversations. There's this trucker named Malik who shares his divorce stories. A nurse coming off her shift who talks about her toxic ex. We become this weird little support group. Week 6, guess who walks in at 2:00am with his new girlfriend? My ex. Of all the diners in The city. He picks mine. I'm frozen. They're looking around for a table. I'm about to have a panic attack when Madison appears like some kind of guardian angel.

My boyfriend and I waited for months for our baby to say his first word, but he kept telling me not to worry, that boys develop slower. I was starting to get anxious because Cody was way past when he should have been talking. Then one Tuesday morning, while I was feeding him breakfast, it finally happened. Cody looked right at me, smiled and clear as day said, may I, with excitement, immediately calling Jake into the kitchen. He said his first word. He said may. But Jake's face went weird when he heard it. He shook his head and said I must have misheard him, that babies don't usually say random months as their first words. But I knew what I heard. Over the next few days, Cody kept saying it, may, may, always the same word, always with this happy little giggle. Afterward, Jake kept insisting I was wrong, that he was just babbling. But something about how defensive he got made me uneasy. After a week of Cody only saying may, I started getting concerned. Other babies said Mama or Dada. I tried teaching him other words, pointing at myself, saying Mama over and over, but he'd just smile and say may again. The weird part was how Jake reacted every single time. He'd tense up, change the subject or suddenly need to leave the room. One afternoon, our babysitter, Kenna, was over. While I was getting ready for work and Cody said it again, May, Kenna and I looked at each other. I saw panic in her face. There was something she wasn't telling me and Cody knew about it. She sat down at the kitchen table and said she had something to tell me, something she'd been feeling guilty about for months. Hannah was sobbing so hard she could barely get the words out. I had to wait five minutes for her to contain herself, dying to know what she was about to tell me. Then she admitted that sometimes we were out, she'd been bringing her friend over to help watch Cody. Her friend's name was Shei. I'm so sorry, Kenna kept saying. I know I should have asked permission. My mind was racing. Shei, not may. I actually laughed, hugging Kenna and telling her it was okay. I was just glad to finally understand what Cody was trying to say. However, I wanted to see it for myself. So I got an idea. The next day before Kenna came over, I put a camera in our living room to see if she'd bring her friend over. Sure enough, about an hour after I left, girl with blonde hair came in. Kenna introduced her to Cody saying, this is Shay. Can you say Shay? And Cody responded with his usual may. It was actually adorable seeing him try to pronounce her name. I felt silly for being so paranoid and Decided to take the camera down. When I got home, I forgot about the camera and the next day while I was at work, I decided to check again. I wanted to see my boyfriend playing with our sweet Cody and text him I loved him. He was on the couch with Cody and I smiled watching them together. Then I heard it may Cody said, reaching his arms up. That's right, buddy, he said.

Then I stood up and told the judge I had a vasectomy. Since 2,018, my wife Tara and I were married seven years. In 2,017, I was diagnosed with a genetic condition that causes progressive nerve damage. Same disease that put my father in a wheelchair by 50, with a 50% chance of passing it to children. I refused to risk condemning a child to my fate. Initially, Tara seemed supportive, but by March 2,018, she started leaving fertility clinic brochures around and making comments about how genetics aren't everything. The arguments escalated until July 2,018, when I discovered she'd been tampering with our birth control. Her browser history was full of searches like how to poke holes in condoms and how to get pregnant when husband doesn't want kids. Most disturbing was a forum post where someone suggested getting me drunk enough that I wouldn't notice if Protection wasn't used. I had replied, that might work. He rarely remembers details when he drinks whiskey. When I confronted her, she broke down crying, saying I'd come around once a baby was on the way. She actually believed tricking me into fatherhood was helping me see what I really wanted. I called my doctor the next morning and scheduled a vasectomy. I didn't tell her I couldn't trust her anymore. The procedure happened in August 2,018, while she Was visiting her sister. When she returned, she asked for a divorce. Can't waste my fertile years on someone who won't change his mind, she said coldly. But two months later, she wanted to reconcile. She showed up at my apartment with takeout and tears, saying maybe she could accept a child free marriage. Suspicious but hopeful, I agreed to try counseling. For 10 months, things seemed better. Then in September 2,019, her phone kept buzzing. While she was in the shower. The preview text from Mark W. Made my stomach drop. Miss you too, baby. Mark was her boss. Opening the messages revealed they've been having an affair for over two years, starting before my diagnosis, continuing through our fertility fights, and even through our reconciliation. She put me on hold while he was relocated to London. I filed for divorce the next day. Four months into the contentious meetings came the hearing for asset allocation. That's when I saw her walking down the courthouse hallway, and my jaw nearly hit the floor. Tara was visibly pregnant, at least six months along, her belly prominently displayed in a form fitting dress. She made deliberate eye contact, cradling her stomach with both hands, a triumphant smile on her lips. In court, her lawyer immediately addressed the pregnancy, claiming it significantly changed the fight. Financial considerations. He accused me of attempting to abandon my responsibilities to my unborn child. Tara dabbed her eyes with tissue. I just want what's best for Our baby, she said softly. The judge's expression grew cooler toward me. Mister Harmon, were you aware of this pregnancy? Before I could answer, her lawyer claimed I'd known about it during our reconciliation, saying my

I pointed it out and he got so flustered, mumbling something about laundry. Then he looked at me totally serious and said, are you gonna cancel the date now? Like a nervous middle schooler, I fell for him right there, socks and all. Two, we were at the arcade and he got way too invested in the claw machine, not for himself, but because he saw a stuffed turtle. He said, look like me when I'm cranky. It took him six tries, 20 bucks and some serious trash talk to the machine, but he got it when he handed it to me. He said, now you can hold me when I'm not around. That turtle's still on my bed. 3, he doesn't know how to cook at all. But one night I was sick and he showed up with instant noodles, gummy bears and a handwritten get well card drawn in blue pen. He spelled fever wrong, but he also drew me as a superhero, complete with a cape and a little speech bubble that said, I got this. I swear I got better instantly. He made me a playlist titled Songs That Remind Me of You and forgot to check the shuffle setting. First song was Shrek 2 soundtrack. I asked if it was a joke. He panicked and said, no, it's romantic. He really loved her. 5. He tied my shoelace because it came undone and said, safety first, princess, like he was a knight or something. I giggled and he turned red. 6. I caught him flexing in the mirror when he thought I wasn't looking. He whispered, she likes strong arms to himself. I had to pretend I didn't hear so he wouldn't die of embarrassment. 7. We walked past a Lego store and he stopped mid sentence, gasped and said, can we please go in just for a minute? Thirty minutes later, he was building a tiny pirate ship and explaining the lore of each mini figure. Eight, he named a raccoon that lives near his apartment. Captain bites and leaves snacks for it every time it shows up. He waves like it's a neighbor. First time I saw it, he said, look, he came to meet you. 9. He once got mad at a seagull because it looked at me wrong. Said, what's it got to squawk about, huh? And puffed his chest like he was ready to square up. 10, he lost a round of UNO and threw a mini tantrum, arms crossed, pouty lift the whole thing. Then he looked up at me totally serious and said, you're lucky I love you or this would be war.

You're fired. I left quietly without making a scene, then told my husband to just smiled. Four hours later, panic broke out, 98 missed calls. I've been the head chef at Romano's for three years. When I started, it was a struggling family restaurant with two star reviews and empty tables. I transformed everything, rebuilt the menu, trained the staff, sourced local ingredients. Within a year, we were booked solid with a waiting list. But when old Mister Romano died last spring, everything changed. His son Giovanni inherited the place and he had different ideas. Cut costs, use frozen ingredients, fire half the kitchen staff. People can't tell the difference anyway, he'd say, counting receipts. While I fought to maintain the standards that built our reputation, I refused to compromise our lamb. Also buco was legendary. Our house made pasta brought people from three states over. I wasn't about to ruin that for Giovanni's, the margins. So on my 32nd birthday, after our biggest week ever, he called me into the cramped office above the dining room. Birthday balloons from the staff still hung in the kitchen below. Here's my surprise for you, he said with this smug grin. You're fired effective immediately. You're too difficult to work with. I stood there, saw stained apron still tied around my waist, watching him lean back in his father's old chair like he just solved World hunger. I didn't argue, didn't cry, just untied my apron, set it on his desk and walked out past the confused prep cooks who'd worked under me for years. The drive home felt endless. Three years of my life gone. My reputation, my team, my recipes all handed over to someone who thought ketchup was a vegetable. My husband, Scott, was waiting in our kitchen with a bottle of wine and that knowing smile he gets when he's up to something. How did the birthday shift go, he asked. Already pouring two glasses. Terrible. Giovanni fired me. His grin widened. Perfect timing. What do you mean perfect timing? I just lost my job. We have a mortgage, Scott. He pulled out his laptop, fingers dancing across the keyboard. Remember that food critic from the times who came in last month, Julia Chen, the one who wrote that amazing review about your lamb dish? Yeah, of course. She said it was transcendent. Why? Well, Scott said, turning the screen toward me, she's been discreetly asking around town about hiring a private chef for her daughter's wedding next weekend. Very exclusive, very high paying. I may have already told her you'd be available. I stared at the email thread. Julia had been trying to reach me for weeks, but Giovanni never passed along messages. She was offering $15,000 for a single event, more than I made in three months at Romano's. Scott, how did you, my phone buzz, text message, then Another. Then it started ringing. Giovanni's number flashed on the screen. I let it go to voicemail. Then more calls. The assistant manager, the sous chef, even the dishwasher. By the time I fact there were 47 missed calls and counting. Scott was refreshing his laptop, cackling. Oh, this is beautiful. Look, escaping review had just gone live on every major food blog and.

My sister Brenda has 3 kids and constantly needs help. This year was different. I secretly spent $6,000 on Christmas, rented a cabin, hired a chef, bought personalized gifts for everyone. The worst, I even covered Brenda's December rent without telling her. But let me back up because this goes deep, better than just Christmas. For the past three years, I've been Brenda's silent financial savior. When her car broke down in June, I paid the $2,800 repair Bill. When her oldest needed braces, I covered the $4,500 orthodontist fee. When her husband lost his job last spring, I quietly transferred $800 every month to give them a float. I never asked for credit, never posted about it. I just helped because I thought that's what family does. Brenda's friends think she's this amazing mom who has it all figured out. They have no idea. Yeah, her perfect life is funded by her loser single sister who works in marketing. This Christmas was supposed to be my masterpiece. I've been planning since October. The cabin had a stone fireplace, professional decorations and a view of the lake. The chef was making prime rib, lobster, Mac and cheese and homemade desserts. I bought each kid exactly what they'd whispered about wanting, the 300 dollar art set for Daisy, the gaming headset for Gavin, the American Girl doll for Violet. I even hired a photographer to capture their Christmas morning faces. Then last week, Brenda texted, don't come to Christmas anymore. You've been difficult lately. Difficult because I said no when she wanted to take credit for the gifts I bought her kids. She literally asked me to rewrap everything and put her name on the tag so they think the presents came from her, not their aunt. When I said I wanted the kids to know who bought them, she called me selfish and attention seeking. They uninvited me from the Christmas I planned and paid for. The audacity was breathtaking. She thought she could kick me out and still enjoy my 6,000 dollar Christmas like some kind of magical elf had arranged everything. So I went nuclear. I cancelled the cabin reservation, lost the one eye 200 dollar deposit, but worth it. Called the chef, cancelled, ate the 500 dollar cancellation fee. Amazon deliveries all stopped. The photographer cancelled. Then I got creative. I revoked the automatic rent payment that had been saving Brenda's ass for 8 months. I cancelled the grocery delivery I'd scheduled for Christmas Eve, $400 worth of spiral ham, fancy sides and wine. I even called the local toy store and cancelled the layaway items I've been paying on since September. Another $800 in gifts. I texted back then, you won't have a holiday either Christmas Eve Five PM, my phone exploded like a bomb went off. First call was Brenda.

My husband Jake lost his parents when he was 8, and his older sister Becca, basically became his mom. She was only 16 at the time, but somehow managed to keep them both afloat. Jake always talked about how she gave up her teenage years to make sure he had clean clothes and hot meals. I get that their bond is special, I really do. But Becca acts like she owns Jake. When we first started dating three years ago, she'd call him every single night at exactly nine PM. If he didn't pick up, she'd blow up his phone until he did. She needed to know where he was, who he was with, what he ate for dinner. It was weird, but Jake said it was normal for them. Then we moved in together last year, Becca had a spare key to our apartment. Within a week, he'd show up unannounced on Saturday mornings with groceries, reorganizing our fridge and telling me I was buying the wrong brand of cereal for Jake. She knew his favorite everything better than I did, and she made sure I knew it. The worst part was how she'd interrogate me about our relationship. She'd corner me in the kitchen while Jake was in the bathroom and ask stuff like, are you two using Protection? And how often do you fight? When I told her it wasn't her Business. Get this hurt look and say, I'm just looking out for my baby brother. Jake always defended her. He'd say I was being sensitive and that Becca just cared about us. But it got worse. After we got engaged six months ago, Becca demanded to see our bank statements because she needed to make sure Jake was making smart financial decisions. She wanted to approve our wedding venue, our guest list, even my dress. When I said no to helping pick my wedding dress, she cried to Jake about how I was shutting her out of important moments. Last month was the breaking point. Jake and I had our first real fight about money. Nothing crazy, just normal couple stuff about whether to buy a new couch or save the money. We talked it out, and everything was fine. But somehow Becca found out. She called Jake the next day, asking a million questions about what happened, if we were okay, if I was being unreasonable with money. Jake told her it was handled and to drop it. She didn't drop it. She showed up at our apartment that night with takeout and flowers, acting like we were getting divorced or something. She kept asking if we needed mediation and offered to help us communicate better, like we were children. That's when I snapped. I looked her dead in the eye and said, Becca, you have no right to know everything about my marriage just because you raised Jake We're adults, and our relationship is between us. She went completely silent. Then she started crying. Not just tearing up, but full on sobbing. She said I was ungrateful for everything she'd done for Jake, that she sacrificed her whole life for him, and that I was trying to steal him away from her. Jake just sat there looking uncomfortable. He didn't defend me or tell her to back off. He just awkwardly patted her shoulder while she cried about how mean I was being. After she left, Jake was mad at me. He said Becca was just trying to help and that I hurt her feelings for no reason. We didn't talk for two days. But then something weird happened. Jake's best friend Ryan came over and heard the whole story. Ryan looked at Jake like he was crazy and said,

So I decided to make her want to be child free too. I'm 26, child free by choice and love my peaceful life. My brother Jason and his wife Amber have three kids under 6. Pure chaos. Amber constantly lectures me about how I'm missing out and need to grow up. She posts passive aggressive Facebook memes about how real women become mothers and corners me at family events saying I'm depriving myself of purpose. Last Friday they called asking me to babysit Saturday for a wedding. I politely declined. I had plans with my friend Clara to go river tubing. We've been planning this for weeks. Amber lost it, screaming about how I'm selfish and need to learn real responsibility. She ended the call with, you need to grow up, Zoe. Saturday morning at 7:00am, I woke up to aggressive banging on my door. There were all three kids. Five year old Liam clutching a tablet, three year old Ava in a tutu with one sock and baby Jackson screaming in his carrier. A sticky note on my door read, be back Sunday. Thanks, Auntie Zoe. They'd literally just dump them like Amazon packages and drove off to their wedding. I called Jason straight to voicemail, texted Amber, nothing. They turned off their phones expecting me to just suck it up and cancel my Life for their convenience. This was their master plan, force me into parenting to prove I was wrong about being childish. Most people would stay home and complain, not me. They wanted to prove I needed this experience. Experience, fine. I'd give them an experience they'd never forget. I packed all three kids in waterproof gear and took them river tubing anyway. Clara met us at the launch, took one look at the chaos and said you're absolutely insane. Then helped me strap Liam into a life vest like this. Think she is. For two hours, we floated down the French Broad River. Ava wore glitter sunglasses and sang frozen songs at every passing kayaker like she was performing at Carnegie Hall. Liam tried catching fish with his bare hands and nearly looked out of his tube twice. Jackson actually calmed down once we got moving. The motion and fresh air put him right to sleep. Other river goers stared at our bizarre parade. A guy in a canoe asked if they were all mine. No, I said cheerfully. Just the world's most reluctant babysitter taking revenge on manipulative relatives. After tubing, we hit this dog friendly taco truck lot near Clara's Ice. She brought her rescue mutt peaches, who immediately became the fourth child. The kids went absolutely wild over the picnic tables and dogs running around. We got them quesadillas with mild cheese and churros, which ended up mostly decorating Ava's face and hair. Jackson passed out in His stroller clutching half a churro like a trophy. I documented everything on Instagram. Photos of the kids laughing in tubes covered in churros, playing with dog dogs, looking absolutely delighted. I captioned it in prompt to adventure babysitting, sometimes the best lessons come from unexpected moments. Thanks for the practice run. By the time we got home, all three were exhausted but genuinely happy. They fell asleep within minutes. Ava on my couch with glitter still sparkling on her forehead. Liam snoring with one shoe mysteriously missing. Jackson sleeping like.

I always had this weird feeling about my Uncle Pete. Like, everyone in my family absolutely loved the guy. He was the fun uncle. You know, the one who'd show up to family barbecues with his loud laugh and those expensive gifts that made all us kids go crazy. He take us out for burgers, let us play games on his phone for hours. And somehow he always knew all the latest slang before we did. But something about Pete just felt off to me. Maybe it was how he'd always squeeze into your personal space when he talked to you, standing way too close. Or how he always wanted to be alone with one of us kids, saying stuff like, let the grown UPS talk and pulling us into another room. My parents thought it was sweet that he wanted to spend time with us. I was 16 when my little cousin Emily started acting different. Emily was always this bubbly kid who asked a million questions and made everyone laugh with her silly jokes. But suddenly she got quiet. Like, really quiet. She stopped joking around completely. Stopped asking her usual why this and why that questions. When I'd ask her what was wrong, she'd just shrug and say she was tired. That wasn't Emily at all. One Saturday, I was helping my dad clean out the garage. We were sorting through old tools and junk when I saw this spare key hanging On a little hook. It had a label that said Pete in my dad's handwriting. That made zero sense to me. Pete didn't live with us. He had his own apartment across town. Why would he need a key to our house? I asked my dad about it. He just chuckled and said Pete probably made a copy years ago when they used to share tools back and forth. You know how your uncle is always borrowing something dad said. But something about that explanation felt wrong. Pete hadn't borrowed tools in years. That night I couldn't sleep. Something about that key kept bugging me. Why would Pete still need access to our house? Why was the key hanging in the garage where everyone could see it? The more I thought about it, the weirder it seemed. The next day I decided to fake being sick and stay home from school. I told my mom I had a headache and she believed me. After everyone left for work and school, I just waited. I had this gut feeling that something was going to happen. Around two forty five PM, right before Emily usually walked home from school and stopped by our house to wait for her mom to pick her up, I heard the garage door open, but nobody was supposed to be home. I looked out the window and saw Pete's blue Honda pulling into our driveway. My heart started pounding. Pete walked straight into the garage like he Owned the place. Grab that key and let himself into the house through the side door. He didn't even knock or call out to see if anyone was home. He just walked right in. I followed him from upstairs, trying to be as quiet as possible. He went straight to the downstairs guest room where Emily usually waited. When she came over, Pete looked around. Then

I'd been the family disappointment for 23 years while my perfect older brother Kyle got everything handed to him when Grandpa died and left me his house in his will, dad absolutely lost it. There's no way that senile old man left you anything, he snarled, pacing around our kitchen like a king aged animal. You're probably not even my real son. Anyway, your mother was sleeping around before we got married. My brother Kyle smirked from the corner. Yeah, remember how wild mom was back in college? Dad's got a point. My stepmother Linda chimed in with that fake sweet voice she always used. Honey, we just want what's fair for the real family. You understand, right? They gave me 48 hours to take a paternity test or they challenge the will in court. The whole extended family was already texting about it in the group chat, calling me a fraud and a bastard. Here's what none of them knew. I've been secretly taking care of Grandpa for the past two years while they all ignored him. Every single doctor's appointment when his arthritis got bad, every grocery run when he couldn't drive anymore, every lonely evening when he just wanted someone to talk to about grandma. I also knew about the second will he'd written just three months before he died. The next morning, dad changed the locks on Grandpa's house. When I showed up with my key, I Couldn't get in. My stuff was piled on the front lawn in garbage bags. You're trespassing, dad yelled from the window. This is family property until you prove you belong here. I called the police. Within an hour, Officer Ortiz was standing in the driveway reading the will. Sir, according to this legal document, your son owns this property. You're the one trespassing. Dad's face went red as they made him give me the new keys. The neighbors were all.

Jess came over to my place Friday night, and I could tell something was bothering her by the way she kept sighing. You know what Britney told me today? She said, flopping down on my couch, her boyfriend is so mysterious, and she's obsessed with him. Meanwhile, you texted me 12 times about being nervous for your presentation. The way she said it made me feel like I was some kind of burden. I wish you were more mysterious, more of a challenge. I should have known this would end badly when three weeks later, she'd be crying at my door. But that night, I just felt hurt and said, fine, I'll be mysterious. That night. I usually would have texted her good night, but I didn't, and it felt wrong not doing it. She sent me three question marks right away, and I just wrote back, all good, and left it at that. Saturday morning came, and normally I'd text her about my coffee and ask what she was up to, but I kept my phone in my pocket. By noon, she. I was texting you okay? And I just sent a thumbs up, which killed me because I actually wanted to talk to her. Monday was the worst because I got the promotion I've been working for, and all I wanted was to call her and celebrate. When we went to dinner, That night, she asked about my day, and I just said, same old while scrolling through my phone, even though inside I was bursting to tell her. She leaned across the table trying to figure out what was going on with me. You seem different, she said. Good. Different. And the crazy part was, she seemed more into me than she had in months, which made me feel powerful, but also completely hollow inside. The second week, she started showing up at my place without calling first and cooking these fancy dinners, basically doing anything to crack me open. I can't figure you out anymore, she said. Wednesday night, and she sounded excited about it. Britney's so jealous, he says I got the mysterious boyfriend. Jackpot. I wanted to tell her how dumb this whole thing was and how much I missed just talking to her normally, but I just shrugged and kept watching TV. Friday, my dad called because my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery, and he was freaking out. I spent three hours calming him down while Jess sat next to me trying to figure out what was happening. After I hung up, she asked, is everything okay? And I wanted to fall into her arms and tell her everything. Family stuff. I said, instead, it's handled. She kissed me harder than she had in months and whispered, you're so strong. But I wasn't strong at all. I was just pretending. The third Thursday night, At eleven PM, Jess showed up at my door with her makeup running down her face, shaking so bad she could barely stand. My mom had a heart attack, sobbed, falling into my arms. She's in surgery. They don't know if she'll make it. My whole chest tightened up and I wanted to tell her it would be okay, that I'd drive her there, that we'd get through it together. All those words were sitting right in my throat, but I'd gotten too good at holding them back. She pulled away and looked at me with these desperate eyes. Say something

I discovered it by accident when my dad but dialed me during my lunch break at work. I heard him tell my mom, clear his day. She's at that coffee shop on Fifth Street again. Perfect. That means she, he won't be driving by the house today. My stomach dropped because I hadn't told them where I was that night. I went through my phone with my tech savvy roommate Jake, and we found it buried in an old family safety app they'd installed when I was still in high school. The location sharing was still active after all these years. But here's what made everything 10 times worse. The app worked both ways so I could see their locations, too. I started scrolling back through months of data and a pattern emerged that made me sick. Every single weekend they claimed to be running errands or busy with work. They were actually at the same mysterious address across town. I've been calling them for months trying to make plans and they were lying every single time. Jake helped me look up the address online and it came back to a beautiful house with a red front door and a perfectly manicured lawn. The property record showed it belonged to a woman named Jennifer Martinez. I had no idea who That was, but my parents were spending every weekend there. So that Saturday I decided to do some investigating of my own and drove across town to see what was really going on. I parked across the street at exactly one forty five PM and waited. At two PM sharp, my parents pulled into the driveway like they owned the place. But they weren't alone. A woman came rushing out of the house and hugged my dad like they've been married for decades. Then I saw something that made my blood run cold. A little boy, maybe 6 years old, came running outside and jumped straight into my mom's arms yelling grandma at the top of his lungs. I sat there for the next three hours watching my parents have a complete family barbecue in this woman's backyard. The same barbecue they'd cancelled on me just last month because they were too tired for company. I watched my dad push this random kid on a swing set while my mom took photos like the proudest grandmother in the world. Then around five PM, Jennifer came outside and planted a kiss on my dad's lips. That was definitely not friendly. That's when it all clicked into place. My dad had been living a double life this entire time. I drove straight to their house, let myself in with my old emergency key and sat in the living room waiting when they walked through the foyer. I want a mom, Marty core Quiet on eight PM still.

What was your breaking point? Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was One afternoon, a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, he said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

Even before my parents signed the divorce papers, my older sister Cameron announced, I'm living with dad. He's got the corporate job making six figures. Mom's just a useless housewife who's been doing nothing for the past 15 years. I watched Mom's face just slightly before she forced to smile. That's okay, sweetie, whatever makes you comfortable. Cameron rolled her eyes. It's not about comfort. It's about being smart. Dad's the one with actual money. She looked at me like I was an idiot when I said I'd stay with mom, enjoy eating canned soup for dinner every night, she said. Dragging her suitcase down the stairs, mom watched her hop in Dad's car quietly and apologized to me for getting the wrong parent. I hugged her. You got this, mom. What I didn't know was that those words were the exact catalyst she needed to prove everyone wrong. Mom landed a job at target, not exactly in a managerial position like dad, but she didn't stop there. Every evening after cooking us dinner, she took online certifications, project management, Quickbooks, data entry, whatever she could get her hands on. And within months, she moved from restocking supplies to a fancy new office job, bookkeeping for a local contractor, and later worked her way up to managing the entire back office operation. I was seriously so proud of her. Meanwhile, Dad's situation was completely different. He Couldn't balance his corporate job with actually parenting Cameron. He started missing meetings to drive her places, called in sick when she had school events. He was spending hundreds on takeout every night, hiring cleaners weekly, paying for babysitters. Even though Cameron was 17 and the last time I saw him, he looked extremely frustrated. After months of repeated offenses at work, his performance tanked and the promotion he'd been promised disappeared. And my sister completely oblivious to it because as long as she had Dad's credit card in her pocket, why would she care, right? That is until mom started her own virtual assistant business. She snagged her first client and quickly started handling five at a time. And I helped her however I could. When our clients reached beyond 20, mom hired her first employee, another mom who needed flexible work. The mom cried when she received the news. You're a blessing, she told her. They both worked hard to expand and hire more moms. And eventually, two years in, she had 12 employees and a real office space of her own, making more money than dad ever brought in. And as for dad, he unfortunately got laid off the same month mom signed the lease on her office. And my sister Cameron, following the scent of money, quickly jumped ship. After dad lost the nice townhouse in the city, my sister called us. Can I stay with you guys a bit? She asked in the sweetest voice. Mom immediately said, yes, of course, family is family. Cameron arrived with her suitcases to find our house completely transformed. Mom had renovated everything. New kitchen, finished basement, the garage converted to a home office in the cars in the driveway had upgraded from Mom's rusty old truck to a beautiful silver BMW M4. And working under mom, I managed to snag a recently released JCW Mini Cooper. My sister's jaw absolutely dropped. Oh my god, mom, you're so cool. She smiled. Thanks, sweetie. While Cameron went on and on.

But now the truth came out. I was 22, just started my dream job as a mechanic when my phone exploded with hate messages. My 16 year old cousin Sarah told everyone I've been sneaking into her room and got her pregnant. Nobody asked for my side. My mom screamed through tears that I was disgusting, asking how she raised such a monster. Dad just hung up on me. My sister Emma blocked me on everything without a word. Even my grandmother who practically raised me after my parents divorce hung up crying saying she was too ashamed to talk to me. Sarah was the family princess, straight A's, honor roll, church youth group leader. Every Sunday. I was the high school dropout. Within 24 hours, the whole extended family had turned against me. My aunt posted these long Facebook rants about protecting our children from creeps hiding in our own family. My uncles were leaving voicemails threatening to beat the hell out of me if they ever saw me again. Cousins I grew up with were sharing screenshots of our old photos with comments like, can't believe I trusted this creep. I waited every single day for police to show up with handcuffs. Every knock on my door made my heart stop. Every unknown phone number sent me into panic attacks thinking it was detectives or lawyers. I lost everything piece by piece. My job, At the auto shop because I couldn't focus, kept making stupid mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss, Mike, finally sat me down after three months and said whatever was happening at home needed to stay there. But I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment four months later when I couldn't make rent, moved in with my buddy Jake, who let me crash on his couch. But even Jake started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Dude, where's your family? It's been 6 months and I've never seen a single relative. I made up lies about them living far away, being busy, having drama. Dating became impossible. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried seeing asked to meet my parents. After 2 months, I panicked and told her they passed in a car accident. She was so sympathetic it made me. Second girl saw through everything. When she noticed I had zero family photos in my apartment, no one to invite to anything, she asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. When I couldn't give her a straight answer, she was gone by morning. Holidays destroyed me completely. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call, someone who cared they existed. I drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway, knowing they were all inside laughing and eating together without me. I finally moved 3 states away. To Colorado and started completely over. New job at a different auto shop, new apartment, new friends who knew nothing about my past. For years I lived like I had no family. Like it just appeared out of nowhere. As an adult, never dated seriously because I couldn't risk anyone digging too deep into my background, built walls so high I forgot what it felt like to trust anyone. Then last month, my phone rang at eleven PM, unknown Colorado number, which was weird because nobody had the.

When I was 15, my mom discovered my journal where I'd written about kissing a girl from my class. She didn't knock when she barged into my room that night. Just stood in the doorway, clutching my journal with white knuckles. This ends now, she said, her voice terrifyingly calm. No daughter of mine will be this. She couldn't even say the word lesbian. I tried explaining that I was still figuring things out, that it wasn't a big deal. But mom called dad in, showed him the pages. He looked more disappointed than angry, which somehow hurt worse. They scheduled an emergency appointment with Pastor Williams the next morning. Not a therapist, not someone trained in adolescent development. Their church pastor, who believed homosexuality was a choice. And listen. For three hours, I sat in his office while he explained how I was confused, how Satan was testing me. My parents nodded along to everything he said. Mom kept squeezing my hand when I tried to speak. The following week, they announced I was being sent to my aunt for the summer. For your spiritual health, mom said. What she didn't say was that my aunt ran a church camp specifically designed to fix kids like me. Camp restoration was nothing like the name suggested. No crafts or swimming or campfires. Just daily air sessions and one on one counseling that felt more like interrogations. We were constantly monitored. No privacy in bathrooms, no unsupervised conversations with other campers. One. One night, a girl named Tara tried to run away. They caught her at the fence and made us all watch as they prayed over her for hours, calling out the demons of rebellion and perversion. Two weeks in, I developed a fever. Not just a slight temperature. I was burning up, delirious. The camp nurse gave me some painkillers and sent me back to group sessions. When I collapsed during prayer, they finally called my parents. Mom and dad drove eight hours to get me in the hospital.

That's when I discovered something brilliant. The closed captioning setting. I realized I could play games completely silent with subtitles on. No sound effects, no music, no voice acting. Just pure visual gaming with text at the bottom. For two months, I played every night for about an hour after my parents thought I was asleep. I became a master of self gaming. I'd wait until I heard their TV turn on downstairs, then carefully power up my PlayStation with the volume at zero. I was living my best secret life. Until the night my dad decided to check on me. I heard his footsteps on the stairs and had maybe ten seconds. I couldn't just turn off the PlayStation. It made noise and took too long. So I did the only thing I could. I drove into bed, pulled the covers over my head, and left the game running. He opened my door, and I held my breath, pretending to be asleep.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years, and I was supposed to be her maid of honour. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend, she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler, who said she was being a total bitch, but I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my Fitness Pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting Coffee with extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better, and she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

We had a rule in our house. If dad was wearing his red baseball cap indoors, nobody was allowed to talk to him, not a word, not even pass the salt at dinner. It wasn't every day. Maybe once or twice a week he'd come home from work red cap on and we'd all just navigate around him. Mom would put his dinner plate down silently. My sister and I would do homework in our rooms. If we needed something from the living room and he was there, we'd wait. I thought this was totally normal, like how some dads have a don't bother me during the game rule. Ours was just the red cap thing. If friends were over and saw the cap, I'd whisper Red Cap Day and they just shrug and we'd play outside. The rule was so ingrained that I once got in trouble at school for ignoring a substitute teacher. She was wearing a red hat and my brain just went, don't talk. I couldn't even explain it properly to the principal. Mom enforced it hard, too. my little sister asked dad for help with homework on a Red Cap Day. Mom grabbed her arm so tight it left marks and dragged her to a room. Later, she apologized but said we had to respect Dad's needs. In high school, I finally asked mom why dad needed Red Cap days. She got this tired look and Said your father works very hard and sometimes he needs quiet to decompress. The cap helps us know when to give him space. Made sense to me. Dad's work hard, whatever. I moved out for college and roommates thought it was hilarious when I'd warn them about my dad's red cap rule before visits. Just don't talk to him if he's wearing it. He's cool otherwise. Last year, I'm home for Thanksgiving. I'm 26 now. Dad wearing the red cap at dinner. We're all eating silently when my boyfriend, who I'd warned repeatedly, accidentally says, sir, could you pass the Turkey? The entire table freezes. Dad's hand stops halfway to his fork. His jaw clenches. Then he just gets up and leaves. Doesn't say a word, just walks out to the garage. Mom starts crying, actually crying at Thanksgiving dinner. My boyfriend is mortified, apologizing profusely. I'm pissed at him but also confused by Mom's reaction. It's just the stupid cap rule. Why is she sobbing? My sister pulls me aside later. You really don't get it, do you? Turns out dad wasn't decompressing. The Red Cap days were when he was.

I was marinating ribs at 6:00am when Lexi texted me, you're uninvited. We don't want you there. No explanation, just a cold dismissal from the person who never lifted a finger for these reunions. For eight years, I've been the backbone of every family gathering. I brought the smoker, bought all the alcohol, coordinated everything. Lexie just showed up and took credit while I did the actual work. She'd waltz in wearing some designer dress, pose for photos and act like she organized everything. While I was sweating over a hot grill, I stared at that text, hands covered in marinade, and typed back, fine, I'm taking my barbecue and drinks with me. An hour later, my phone exploded, 15 missed calls from cousins, uncles, everyone panicking. Wait, you're not coming? What about the food? Lexi said you bailed on us. My voicemail was completely full. Text after text rolled in. Please tell me you're joking. The reunion won't be the same without your brisket. What happened? That's when I realised Lexi's fatal mistake. She never told them she uninvited me. She just announced I cancelled and left them scrambling with no backup plan. Classic Lexi, creating problems and expecting everyone else to solve them. I texted my cousin Matthew, Lexi uninvited me, but you're welcome at my place. I've got everything we need. Matthew immediately called back. Absolutely furious. She did what? That's completely insane. I'm coming over and bringing everyone I can convince. Within minutes, half the family was choosing my backyard over Lexi's disaster. Even the neighbours wanted in. When word spread about the impromptu cookout happening on my street, my phone kept buzzing with acceptances. Uncle Hank on my way with the cornhole boards and my famous hot sauce. Cousin Liz bringing my potato salad and the good folding chairs. Even my elderly Aunt Diana said she'd rather come to mine because that girl has no business running anything important. By 10:00am, I had people showing up to help set up. My neighbour Jeff brought his outdoor speakers and string lights. The kids from down the street asked if they could use my pool. This was turning into something way bigger than any family reunion we'd ever had. Lexi started calling around noon, completely panic. Where is everyone? Only six people showed up and I ordered food for 30. I could hear the desperation and anger in her voice. She tried to exclude me.

Since freshman year, everyone knew Aria as the girl who'd loudly announce she only hung out with guys because girls are too much drama. She'd sit at the guys table, laugh at every sexist joke louder than anyone else, and somehow convinced herself that calling other girls too sensitive made her special. The crazy part was the guys ate it up. Even teachers thought Aria was refreshingly laid back compared to other girls. I remember this one time in PE when a girl complained about the boys snapping girls bra straps. Aria actually stood up and said it's just guys being guys, stop being such a baby about it. The male coach literally thanked her for being rational. That was Aria's whole thing. She was the cool girl who got it. She'd brag about watching porn with the guys, rate other girls bodies with them, and called feminism victim mentality. Girls who tried to call out inappropriate behavior became her targets. He'd mock them with fake crying sounds, post their complaints on social media to ridicule them, and loudly proclaim how she wasn't like those uptight bitches who couldn't take a joke. During junior year when Natalie recorded getting groped at a party, Aria was the first to say, Natalie was probably asking for it wearing that dress. Guys would high five her. Call her basically a dude with TITS, and she'd beam like she'd won the lottery. When we all came back on Monday after spring break of senior year, we were preparing for the moment. Aria went off on a girl and snickered with one of her guy friends. But first period arrives, and Aria walks past the guys table without even glancing at them. Not like avoiding them. Aria just walked past like they didn't exist. She sits down at a table full of girls, the same girls she'd spent three years mocking. Vivian, who she'd called a dramatic princess. Audrey, who she'd labeled attention seeking for reporting harassment. Natalie, whose reputation she tried to destroy. The guys started calling her over. Yo, Aria, we saved your spot. She didn't even turn her head. It was like she'd gone deaf to male voices. At first, everyone thought it was some weird joke. Maybe she lost a bet over spring break. Maybe this was some elaborate prank that would turn into the ultimate pick me moment. We were on the edge of our seats, waiting for her to burst out yelling, I was right. Girls are too much drama. But Aria kept sitting with the girls. She stopped responding to the guys'texts, unfollowed all of them on every platform. When Ethan tried to talk to her after chemistry, she looked right through him and kept walking. Days turned into weeks. The guys went from confused to angry. They started spreading rumors. That Aria was on her period, that she turned into a crazy feminist overnight. That she was probably a lesbian now. They tried everything to get a reaction. Nothing. Aria just kept sitting with the girls, actually listening when they talked, not interrupting to defend male behavior. The girls were suspicious at first. This had to be some long con to gather gossip for the boys. But Aria never brought up the guys, never defended them. When Jake

I didn't yell. I just told her to give back my ring and get out. Weeks later, she was begging me. Kayla and I had been together 4 years, engaged since February. I'm a union electrician in Columbus. Been pulling overtime shifts to build our wedding fund. She's a physical therapist and we had everything planned, church, wedding, kids, someday, the whole future mapped out. Last Tuesday changed everything. She came home acting nervous, sat on the couch edge without looking at me and started with, we need to talk. I ran into hunter a few weeks ago, she said, picking at her fingernails. You remember him from high school? We've been talking since March, just catching up at first. Coffee, lunch, old friends reconnecting. My stomach dropped. Kayla, what are you telling me? He proposed 3 days ago? And I, I said yes. I stared at her, still wearing my ring while telling me she was engaged to someone else. The audacity was breathtaking. Take off my ring, I said standing up. You don't get to wear my ring while you're engaged to someone else. Her hands shook as she twisted it off. Four months of overtime shifts to pay for that thing. I told her to pack a bag and leave that night. But the real insanity was just beginning. Her family started blowing up my phone. And I should be happy for Kayla's Destiny and that true love finds a way. Like I was the villain for not wanting to share my fiance with her high school sweetheart. Three weeks later, after their engagement photos hit Facebook with captions about God's plan revealing itself. I got a text from an unknown number. It was Kayla, asking if I could help with a few thousand to secure their wedding venue, apparently Hunter's construction.

HR sent an email freezing my 30 year pension. They forgot the exit clause in my founder's agreement that stated any adverse change to my compensation triggered a mandatory 25 million dollar penalty. I knew they'd screwed up the moment I saw that cold corporate email. Due to evolving fiscal priorities, your pension benefits are temporarily suspended. No phone call, no explanation, just a chatbot message for someone who helped build this company from nothing. I sat in my kitchen toast getting cold reading it again and again. 30 years of weekends, crises and late nights and this is how they repay me like I was just another line item to cut. The email came from Jennifer Walsh. Some 28 year old VP probably thinks I'm just another old timer collecting dust and accounting. She's never heard the stories about how I mortgaged my house three times to keep payroll running in 0 a. Never knew about the Christmas I spent in the server room fixing a catastrophic data breach while everyone else was home opening presents. But here's what they forgot. I'm not just any employee. I'm a founder. I walked to my kitchen cabinet, the one where old papers go to die and pulled out a dusty finder, my original founders agreement from 2001. I flipped to page 47, clause 14 d. Any material adverse change to compensation triggers immediate Severance payout of $25 million payable within 72 business hours. My old lawyer Bruce insisted on it back When we were worth nothing, four of us in a garage surviving on ramen and spite. Ellen, he said, pouring cheap whiskey into coffee mugs. Someday this company will get big and stupid. When it does, you'll want to kill switch. We laughed about it then. 25 million felt like monopoly money. Now the company is worth 2.8 billion. I called my current lawyer, Charles, is clause 14 d still active? 3 hour callback. Ellen, they never avoided it. In fact, when they restructured executive compensation in 2019, your original agreement was specifically exempted. They're completely screwed. That's when I smiled for the first time in weeks. I drafted one simple email to H R. Due to pension freeze per H R, 4, 5, 6 b, invoking clause 14D per founders Agreement, please confirm wire transfer timeline. E. Morrison, co founder. I added my old title just to watch them scramble. Sent it at 9:00am on a Tuesday. At 10:15, my phone started buzzing. Unknown numbers, frantic voicemails from people I hadn't heard from in years. Word was spreading through the executive floors like wildfire. The C F. O. Called at 11:15 a. M. His voice was shaking. Ellen, we need to talk. This is, this is serious about what I asked. Sipping my tea, watching squirrels fight over bird seed in my backyard. The, the claws. The 25 million claws. Please tell me this is some kind of mistake. Oh, that no mistake. Yes. 72 business hour.

Emma had always been the attention seeking sister. When I got engaged to Tyler, she immediately started planning ways to make my wedding about her. She dropped hints about how she wished someone would propose to her, how she was getting older, how weddings made her so emotional. Ignored most of it because I was too busy planning the actual wedding. Two weeks before the big day, Emma casually mentioned she'd found the perfect dress. She showed me a photo on her phone. It was clearly white. Not cream, not ivory, not off white. Pure white with lace details that looked almost bridal. Emma, that's a white dress. I said, it's champagne. She lied, even though we could both see it was white. You can't wear white to my wedding. Oh, please, it's 2024. Those rules are so outdated. Besides, it'll look different in photos. I told my mom, who just sighed and said Emma would probably change her mind. I told my maid of honor, Katie, who offered to spill wine on Emma if needed. But honestly, I was too stressed with last minute wedding planning to fight about it. Morning of my wedding, I was getting ready in the bridal suite when Katie burst in. Your sister just walked in wearing that white dress, and it's worse than the photo. I looked out the window and saw Emma posing for photos. With our cousins, the dress was absolutely white, floor length and had this dramatic train. She looked like she was trying to be a second bride. But here's where it gets good. My husband's family is Italian, and his grandmother, Nona Rosa, takes traditions very seriously. She's this tiny 85 year old woman who doesn't speak much English, but somehow always knows what's happening. During the ceremony, I could see Nona Rosa staring at Emma with this look of pure disgust. After we set our vows during the cocktail hour, Nona Rosa marched straight up to Emma. You wear white to someone else's wedding, she said in her broken English, loud enough for everyone nearby to hear.

The grocery store security footage showed my face hitting the floor. Blood pooled around my head where I cracked it on the tile. When I woke up in the hospital, I immediately threw up blood. You're literally starving to death, the doctor told me. I tried to sit up, but the room spun violently. I need to get back to work. Rent is due tomorrow. She pushed me back down. You're 16 years old and you weigh 80 pounds. That can't be right. When did you last eat a meal? Three days ago, I think. She looked horrified. Where are your parents right now? In the basement, playing their online game like always. They don't know you're dying. They told me not to bother them unless someone is dead. You almost were dead. Almost doesn't count, according to them. She glanced at my chart. You work two jobs and go to school. I work at 4 in the morning delivering newspapers, then I go to school. Then I work at the grocery store until midnight. That's physically impossible. Red Bull and gas station pills make it possible you're taking stimulants. I have to pay rent or we get evicted. Your parents don't have jobs. They quit two years ago to become professional gamers. Are they making money from gaming? I laughed. They've made exactly zero dollars, but they keep saying fame is coming any day now. How much sleep are You getting. My thoughts kept slipping away like water through my fingers. Three hours on a good night, but usually less. Do you ever feel dizzy or confused? Every single day. But I can push through it. She stared at me in disbelief. Your parents make you work while they stay home gaming all day. They're trying to build their streaming career. They need my support. She examined my arms, which looked like twigs, 40 pounds underweight because you're feeding them instead of yourself. You don't understand. They should be able to follow their dreams after the sacrifices they made for me. My manager, Jimmy, had been sitting in the corner listening. He finally spoke up, looking sick with guilt. I should have said something sooner. This kid has been falling apart for months. He has been seeing things at work that aren't real. The doctor turned to him quickly. What kind of things? Yesterday he was having full conversations with nobody for 20 minutes straight. I felt my face get hot. Sometimes when I'm really tired, I see shadows that aren't there. That's your brain literally shutting down from exhaustion. Jimmy looked broken. And last week I found him unconscious in the freezer. He had been in there for 40 minutes, had blue lips. I was just resting my eyes. You could have died, but I didn't. So it's fine. The doctor checked my blood work again. Your body is failing and you're still defending them. They're my parents. I owe them everything. You don't owe them your life. Without me, they'll be homeless. Without them, you'd be healthy. The doctor called Child Protective Services and a social worker arrived within an hour. They tried calling my parents 23 times before anyone answered. The doctor put them on speaker so the social worker could record everything. I could hear battle sounds and screaming from their game in the background. This better be important because you just made us lose a ranked match. The doctor spoke calmly. This is the hospital calling about your son who collapsed at work. What does that lazy piece of garbage want now? He's in critical condition from severe malnutrition. My dad exploded. Of course, I should have just let him die when he was born instead of wasting 16 years feeding him. Everyone in the room froze. Your son is hospitalized with severe exhaustion and malnutrition. The doctor said carefully. That lazy.

My wife walked in 6 months pregnant, claiming it was mine and that I was abandoning my new family. Then I stood up and told the judge I had a vasectomy. Since 2,018, my wife Tara and I were married 7 years. In 2,017, I was diagnosed with a genetic condition that causes progressive nerve damage, the same disease that put my father in a wheelchair by 50, with a 50% chance of passing it to children. I refused to risk condemning a child to my fate. Initially, Tara seemed supportive, but by March 2,018, she started leaving fertility clinic brochures around and making comments about how genetics aren't everything. The arguments escalated until July 2,018, when I discovered she'd been tampering with our birth control. Her browser history was full of searches like how to coals and condoms and how to get pregnant when husband doesn't want kids. Most disturbing was a forum post where someone suggested getting me drunk enough that I wouldn't notice if Protection wasn't used. I had replied, that might work. He rarely remembers details when he drinks whiskey. When I confronted her, she broke down crying, saying I'd come around once a baby was on the way. She actually believed tricking me into fatherhood was helping me see what I really wanted. I called my doctor the next morning and scheduled a vasectomy. I didn't tell her I couldn't trust her anymore. The procedure happened in August 2,018, while she Was visiting her sister. When she returned, she asked for a divorce. Can't waste my fertile years on someone who won't change his mind, she said coldly. But two months later, she wanted to reconcile. She showed up at my apartment with takeout and tears, saying maybe she could accept the child free marriage. Suspicious but hopeful, I agreed to try counseling. For 10 months, things seemed better. Then in September 2,019, her phone kept buzzing. While she was in the shower. The preview text from Mark W. Made my stomach drop. Miss you too, baby. Mark was her boss. Opening the messages revealed they've been having an affair for over two years, starting before my diagnosis, continuing through our fertility fights, even through our reconciliation. She put me on hold while he was relocated to London. I filed for divorce the next day. Four months into the contentious proceedings came the hearing for asset allocation. That's when I saw her walking down the courthouse hallway, and my jaw nearly hit the floor. Tara was visibly pregnant, at least six months along, her belly prominently displayed in a form fitting dress. She made deliberate eye contact, cradling her stomach with both hands, a triumphant smile on her lips. In court, her lawyer immediately addressed the pregnancy, claiming it significantly changed the financial considerations. He accused me of attempting to abandon my responsibilities to my unborn child. Tara dabbed her eyes with tissue. I just want what's best for our baby. She said softly. The judge's expression grew cooler toward me. Mister Harmon, were you aware of this pregnancy? Before I could answer, her lawyer claimed I'd known about it during our reconciliation, saying my

That's the best response ever. Most people listen anyway. So congratulations. So that's awesome. Hi. Hey, I'm calling you today because we do a segment on our show called The 2nd Date Update. It's where you go out on a date with somebody and then if you end up not calling them back after that date, they email us to see if we can get you on the phone and ask if something went wrong. We recently got an email about you from one of our listeners. Uh, oh, his name is Chris. You guys went out for gelato. Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, Chris has been trying to get a hold of you and he's wondering why you're not calling him back. Oh, God. Oh God. I feel so horrible. He honestly thinks I'm, I'm blowing him off. Yeah. Oh, no. Okay. It means that you want nothing to do with him. Oh, God. I, I lost my phone. Like, I lost my phone like four days ago or something. And, and I just got it today. Like, literally, like three hours ago, I just got a new phone. That's not even a lie. I've just been, like, trying to put all my contacts back on it and everything and. Oh, I feel so horrible that he thinks that. So. Are you saying you're not blowing him off? No. Oh, my God. No. I had a great time. I, I was planning on calling him, like, later today, once I got all my contacts back and everything. that's pretty anticlimactic. I was hoping you had something terrible to say about him, but. Oh, no, sorry to disappoint you. I, yeah, I, I really liked him. We had a great time. Oh, that's so cute. Well, in that case, could you, like, email him or call him and tell him that I will be calling him later tonight? I could do that. But why don't you just do it yourself? Because Chris is actually on the other line listening.

I didn't know guys will just stand in the shower for 10 minutes doing nothing, no water running, just standing there like they're waiting for a download to finish. The first time I walked in on it, I thought something was wrong. He looked at me all calm and said, I'm just mentally preparing. I've never looked at showers the same way. 2. I found out men treat fridges like treasure hunts. He'll open it five times in a row, stare like something new is going to spawn, sigh dramatically, and then eat plain cheese straight from the block. I once asked why he keeps checking. He said, in case a snack magically appears. Three, I didn't know guys hum to themselves during the most random tasks. My boyfriend will be cleaning the sink, humming what sounds like boss battle music, then suddenly switch to singing about how this sponge is my sword. I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said, but it still smells like me, so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said, because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6, 10. They make sound effects for everything, opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7, they'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8, they'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes. And apparently that's normal to them. 9, they'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car, groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10, they can sit in total silence for an hour staring at the wall. And when you ask what they're thinking about, they say nothing. And somehow they really mean nothing.

Aria was the girl who'd throw any girl under the bus for five seconds of male approval. Since freshman year, everyone knew Aria as the girl who'd loudly announce she only hung out with guys because girls are too much drama. She'd sit at the guys table, laugh at every sexist joke louder than anyone else, and somehow convinced herself that calling other girls too sensitive made her special. The crazy part was the guys ate it up. Even teachers thought Aria was refreshingly laid back compared to other girls. I remember this one time in PE when a girl complained about the boys snapping girls bra straps. Aria actually stood up and said it's just guys being guys, stop being such a baby about it. The male coach literally thanked her for being rational. That was Aria's whole thing. She was the cool girl who got it. She'd brag about watching porn with the guys, rate other girls bodies with them, and called feminism victim mentality. Girls who tried to call out inappropriate behavior became her targets. He'd mock them with fake crying sounds, post their complaints on social media to ridicule them, and loudly proclaim how she wasn't like those uptight bitches who couldn't take a joke. During junior year when Natalie recorded getting groped at a party, Aria was the first to say Natalie was probably asking for it. Wearing that dress, guys would high five Her call her basically a dude with TITS, and she'd beam like she'd won the lottery. When we all came back on Monday after spring break of senior year, we were preparing for the moment. Aria went off on a girl and snickered with one of her guy friends. But first period arrives, and Aria walks past the guys table without even glancing at them. Not like avoiding them. Aria just walked past like they didn't exist. She sits down at a table full of girls, the same girls she'd spent three years mocking. Vivian, who she'd called a dramatic princess. Audrey, who she'd labeled attention seeking for reporting harassment. Natalie, whose reputation she tried to destroy. The guys started calling her over. Yo, Aria, we saved your spot. She didn't even turn her head. It was like she'd gone deaf to male voices. At first, everyone thought it was some weird joke. Maybe she lost a bet over spring break. Maybe this was some elaborate prank that would turn into the ultimate pick me moment. We were on the edge of our seats, waiting for her to burst out yelling, I was right. Girls are too much drama. But Aria kept sitting with the girls. She stopped responding to the guys'texts, unfollowed all of them on every platform. When Ethan tried to talk to her after chemistry, she looked right through him and kept walking. Days turned into weeks. The guys went from confused to angry. They started spreading Rumors that Aria was on her period, that she turned into a crazy feminist overnight, that she was probably a lesbian now. They tried everything to get a reaction. Not thing Aria just kept sitting with the girls, actually listening when they talked, not interrupting to defend male behavior. The girls were suspicious at first. This had to be some long con to gather gossip for the boys. But Aria never brought up the guys, never defended them. When Jake

We had a rule in our house. If dad was wearing his red baseball cap indoors, nobody was allowed to talk to him. Not a word. Not even pass the salt at dinner. It wasn't every day. Maybe once or twice a week, he'd come home from work, red cap on, and we'd all just navigate around him. Mom would put his dinner plate down silently. My sister and I would do homework in our rooms. If we needed something from the living room and he was there, we'd wait. I thought this was totally normal. Like how some dads have a don't bother me during the game rule. Ours was just the red cap thing. If friends were over and saw the cap, I'd whisper, Red Cap Day, and they just shrug, and we'd play outside. The rule was so ingrained that I once got in trouble at school for ignoring a substitute teacher. She was wearing a red hat, and my brain just went, don't talk. I could. I couldn't even explain it properly to the principal. Mom enforced it hard, too. my little sister asked dad for help with homework on a red cap day. Mom grabbed her arm so tight it left marks and dragged her to her room. Later, she apologized, but said we had to respect Dad's needs. In high school, I finally asked mom why dad needed red cap days. She got this tired Look and said your father works very hard and sometimes he needs quiet to decompress. The cap helps us know when to give him space. Made sense to me. Dads work hard. Whatever. I moved out for college and roommates thought it was hilarious when I'd warn them about my dad's red cap rule before visits. Just don't talk to him. If he's wearing it, he's cool. Otherwise. Last year, I'm home for Thanksgiving. I'm 26 now. Dad's wearing the red cap at dinner. We're all eating silently when my boyfriend, who I'd warned repeatedly, accidentally says, sir, could you pass the Turkey? The entire table freezes. Dad's hand stops halfway to his fork, his jaw clenches. Then he just get it's up and leaves. Doesn't say a word, just walks out to the garage. Mom starts crying. Actually crying. At Thanksgiving dinner. My boyfriend is mortified, apologizing profusely. I'm pissed at him, but also confused by Mom's reaction. It's just the stupid cap rule. Why is she sobbing? My sister pulls me aside later. You really don't get it, do you? Turns out dad wasn't decompressing. The red cap days were when he was.

She expected that. I forgot to send crisis calls. I didn't answer. Then she showed up at my apartment on a Tuesday. Mascara smudged, hair messy. You're ignoring me, she said, voice trembling. No, I've been answering your texts. You know what I mean. This isn't how friends act. You're right. Friends don't owe each other Midnight Crisis calls. Friends don't scream at each other for having boundaries. Friends don't show up unannounced demanding emotional labor. Since when are you such an emotionless robot? Since you told me we were better as friends. This is what that looks like? For the first time, I saw it click. The realization that I wasn't playing some revenge game or tactic to win her back. This was just what was left. Don't get to hate me for treating you exactly how you asked to be treated, I said quietly. Tears spilled over. Not the pretty, performative ones that used to got me, but messy, real ones. You were supposed to. Her voice cracked. What, wait around as your backup plan? Stay on the hook in case things didn't work out with Mark? She didn't answer. The silence stretched between us, thick with everything she'd never admit out loud. Her last text came a week later. Maybe we could try again. I stared at it for a long moment before typing. Nah. We're better as friends, remember? Then I blocked her number. Six months later, I saw her at A coffee shop. Sitting alone by the window, staring into a half empty cup. No Mark, no friends. Just her. And that same vanilla perfume hanging in the air like a ghost. She spotted me. Her eyes widened with hope, panic, then shame. She opened her mouth like she might call out to me. I gave her a polite nod, the kind you'd give an acquaintance, took my coffee and walked out without looking back.

So I treated her like any other casual acquaintance. Now she's begging me to care like I used to, but I'm not interested anymore. We've been together for three years when she delivered the line over dinner in our apartment. We're better as friends, she said, swirling wine in her glass, like this was just another casual conversation. I need space to breathe, to figure myself out. The soft lighting made her look almost regretful, but I could see the nervous energy buzzing beneath her skin. Her foot tapped impatiently against the hardwood floor. She wanted a reaction. Tears, begging, maybe even anger. Anything to prove this mattered. Okay, I said, if that's what you want. Her eyebrows twitched. That wasn't the script she rehearsed. You're just too much sometimes, she continued, words tumbling out. I'll always love you, just not like that. She reached across to squeeze my hand with that old comforting gesture that used to mean something. I get it, I said, sliding my hand away. No hard feelings. Her face did something complicated. Confusion, then irritation, maybe even disappointment. She wanted a scene, wanted to be the one walking away from tears and pleading. Instead she was getting indifference. You're taking this really well, she said, accusation creeping into her tone. What's there to take badly? You said we're better as friends. I believe you. I just thought you'd fight for us. You're breaking up with Me and mad. I'm not arguing about it. She wanted to be the strong one, the one who walked away with dignity. Instead, I was perfectly composed while she fumbled for control. I just thought what we had meant more to you, she muttered. It did. But I'm not going to beg someone to stay who wants to leave. She left that night expecting me to chase her.

So I'm standing in the middle of a thrift store holding a note I just found in a vintage jacket's pocket, and my hands won't stop shaking. The note says Priya, wear this jacket to Meridian Park on June 10th at three PM. Stand in the red circle. Your life will change forever. My name is Priya. Spelled exactly like that. Not the Americanized Priya everyone always assumes. But I've never seen this jacket before, and I literally walked into this store 90 seconds ago. What's more, today is literally June 10th. It's currently two thirty PM, and the jacket fits perfectly. The rational part of my brain screamed this was obviously some elaborate prank, or maybe I was being recruited for one of those hidden camera shows, but the 23 year old part of me, who'd spent the last year in the most boring accounting job imaginable, couldn't resist the pull of whatever this was. I bought the jacket for $7, drove straight to Meridian Park, and arrived at 2:58 p. M. Wearing it like armor. The park was weirdly crowded for a Tuesday afternoon, with at least 40 people scattered around, seemingly doing normal park things reading, jogging, playing Frisbee. But something felt choreographed about it all. When I walked past a group of women on a blanket, they all simultaneously looked away. A jogger ran the same loop three times, checking his watch each time he passed. Me, two guys with obviously expensive camera equipment tried to look casual by pretending to film squirrels, but one of them was holding the camera backwards. I actually laughed out loud at that one, and he turned bright red. My heart was pounding like I was about to jump out of a plane. This was it. This was the adventure I've been waiting for my whole mundane life. I spotted the red circle spray painted near the fountain. Took a deep brass it tasted like possibility, and walked toward it, feeling like the main character. The second my feet touched the red circle, the world exploded into orchestrated chaos. Drums start beating from hidden speakers. Violins joined in with some classical piece I recognized but couldn't name. And suddenly, everyone in the park stood up and started throwing rose petals into the air. Amazing. It was like being inside a snow globe made of flowers. People formed a pathway behind me, all of them grinning and filming with their phones. My heart was doing gymnastics in my chest. This was happening. This was really happening. Something magical, something extraordinary was finally happening to me. A voice behind me, nervous but determined, said, Priya, will you marry me? I spun around, already laughing and crying at the same time, ready to see who had orchestrated this incredible moment. Ready to say yes to the adventure. Ready for my life to finally begin. A man I'd never seen before in my life. Was kneeling in front of me, holding out a ring box. But when he saw my face, his face went from hopeful to confused to horrified in about two seconds. The ring tumbled from his shaking hands. Who the hell are you? He whispered, still on one knee, while rose petals continued to fall around us like confused butterflies. You're not Priya. The music cut off abruptly. Someone in the crowd said, that's not her. Quinnie. The guy quinnie apparently stood up slowly with his face pale. You're wearing her jacket, he said. Um. I found this jacket.

I said, cancel the entire wedding? She gasped. But, sir, you're not the bride. No, but I own the venue, the catering company, and the hotel chain. They booked for guests. See, my brother James was marrying this entitled socialite, Melissa. Her mom, Eleanor, treated me like hired help. From day one. They made insane demands. Wanted me to remove a historic chandelier because it clashed with the aesthetic. My staff create 15 different sample menus before choosing, then demanded we redo them because the fonts were too common. The worst part, they'd schedule meetings with my venue coordinator at 6 a m, then cancel 30 minutes before my poor manager, Anthony, would drive across town for nothing. You're a saint for putting up with this. Told me after Eleanor demanded we repaint the entire ballroom because the current shade of ivory was too pedestrian. Eleanor also insisted we fire our head chef because he looked unprofessional, meaning he was Hispanic. I refused, but she kept pushing. I tolerated it because I love James. Growing up, it was just us two. After our parents divorced messily, I practically raised him while mom worked three jobs. When I built my hotel empire from nothing, starting as a waitress and working my way up, James was my biggest cheerleader. He'd brag to friends about his sister who made it big. But Melissa changed him completely. Suddenly, My new money was embarrassing. Eleanor would make comments about how some people think wealth means class. During one particularly nasty encounter, she looked around my flagship hotel's lobby and sniffed, it's very commercial, isn't it? Not quite the atmosphere for discerning clientele. When invitation time came, nothing arrived in my mailbox. I waited weeks, checking daily. I called other family members. Everyone got theirs. Gorgeous gold foil with handwritten notes from Melissa thanking them for being true family. At our family dinner, Eleanor made it crystal clear. There's a difference between serving the elite and being one of them. Don't you think, Natalie? She said my name like it tasted bitter. James just stared at his late. My own brother. Wouldn't defend me. That's when Melissa chimed in. The wedding is very intimate. We're keeping it to people who truly understand our vision. They saw me as the help, not family. Good enough to provide the venue, staff and accommodations, but not good enough, to wit, miss their special day. The wedding planners call was the last straw. They wanted me to pay, but not attend my own brother's wedding. We've decided the guest list needs to be more refined, she explained, and awkwardly. But, of course, all the vendor contracts remain in place, exactly as agreed. So I pulled the plug on everything. Ma'am, as of now, the venue is unavailable, catering is canceled, and all hotel rooms are released. Your clients will need to find new vendors. Immediately. You can't do that. The contracts are iron clad. Check the fine print carefully. All agreements are void if the vendor is excluded from the event without cause. My lawyers made sure of that clause. Three hours later, James called, sobbing hysterically. Melissa was having a complete meltdown. No!

But I felt more embarrassed for him. In the end, all the signs were there. My husband Rodney was coming home late from work. He started going to the gym on weekends, wearing expensive Cologne, buying all these expensive watches and shirts. Everything he constantly said was stupid and unnecessary. Now that we were married, I never really connected the pieces. Until one day it happened. My friend Millie and I were chatting on the phone while she was swiping through Tinder, when she gasped. Sam, she said suddenly, really loud, why is Rodney on Tinder? She instantly took screenshots and texted them over. I covered my mouth, too shocked to speak. They were my husband's old pictures, with where them fun girls at? In the description. Maybe this is old, I said. It says he's active two minutes ago, Millie said quietly, but I still couldn't believe it. Later, when Rodney stepped into the shower, I quickly checked his phone on the nightstand. The notifications told the whole story. New message from Laurel. New message from Melissa. Matched with Sarah. Dating apps I'd never heard of. Lit up his screen like a slot machine. When he came out of the shower, I was sitting on the bed with his phone. It's not what it looks like, he said immediately. It looks like you're on five dating apps while you're married. He snatched his phone from my hand. You went through my phone without my Permission? That's Psycho, Sam, he said, as if I was the villain here. This is. This is cheating, Rodney. This is your fault. You're too vanilla. You make cookies and sing songs about colors all day. I'm a guy. I need excitement. Excitement! I repeated in disbelief. Rodney, get out! You're seriously ending our marriage over this? He scoffed. I said, get out! He packed a bag, still ranting. Good luck finding someone who wants a boring wife with a boring job and boring life. He slammed the door on his way out. I changed the locks the next morning, and I thought that was it. That I'd never have to deal with that horrible man ever again. But I was so wrong. I was stuck in my house all week, crying and stuffing my face with ice cream, when my friend Millie showed up to my house with reinforcements. Three of our friends burst through my door with wine and my red dress. It's singles night, and you're coming with us, they said, already dragging me into the shower to get ready. Guys, I have appreciate you stopping by, but I'm really not ready. I sighed. Sam, you don't have to meet anyone. You just gotta get out, get some fresh air, be with friends. Remember just how amazing you were without him. I look at them, seeing how much they cared for me. I couldn't say no. The place was packed and I felt so out of place. Got dragged here by friends, too? A man asked, approaching me with a friendly smile. They were honestly doing me a favor, I said, smiling back. My friends happily watched us talk from a distance, almost tearing up when they saw me laughing again. But the man, Justin, a pediatrician who was really just that funny. His story about his nephew's show until disaster was heartwarming and wild, and the more I spoke with him, the more all the pain and heartbreak seemed to go away. But just as we started really hitting it off, Rodney entered the bar and started going around the room, approaching woman after woman. I felt my face pale until I saw something strange. All the women kept turning him away. One actually held up her hand in his face and walked off. Another looked at him, made a disgusted face, and turned back to her friends, and I almost felt embarrassed for him. Then he spotted me with Justin and stormed over. Hey, buddy, that's my wife! He grabbed my arm painfully. Justin pushed him away and looked at Rodney's left hand. I don't see a ring. Rodney's face went red. He turned to me. We're still married, you know. Wow! That's exactly what I told you when I found out you were on

Two years with Emma, and I thought we were rock solid. We moved in together after 18 months, split everything fifty fifty, supported each other's dreams, and genuinely talked about marriage. But her three single friends, complete relationship vultures who couldn't stand seeing anyone happy. Madison, Ashley, and Chloe. They found red flags in good morning texts and thought guys who don't immediately respond are emotionally unavailable. These three met twice a week for their wine nights at Madison's apartment. At first, Emma would come home with innocent questions. Madison thinks it's weird you don't get jealous when guys talk to me at the coffee shop. Or Ashley says most guys would have proposed by now if they were serious. I'd address these calmly, reassure her about our timeline and trust, and we'd move on. I thought it was just friend noise, but it escalated quickly. Emma started testing me constantly. She'd cancel our date nights last minute to see if I'd fight her on it or just accept it. She'd flirt with guys right in front of me at parties to see if I'd get possessive and stake my claim. She'd pick random fights about dishes or whose turn it was to buy groceries, then storm off to see if I chase after her and beg for forgiveness. I tried patience. I tried communication. I even suggested couples counseling to work through whatever was making her feel insecure. But Madison convinced her that suggesting therapy meant I thought she was crazy and that our relationship was already doomed. The breaking point came on our two year anniversary. I've been planning for weeks dinner at the same Italian place where we had our first date. I'd even reserve the same corner booth. After dinner, I had a surprise weekend getaway planned, complete with the Vineyard tour she'd been mentioning. Emma seemed off all day, checking her phone constantly. Jump when it buzzed. I figured she was planning her own anniversary surprise. Maybe finally ready to have that serious conversation about our future. We're at dinner. The ambiance was perfect. And suddenly, right as the waiter is setting down our bruschetta, Emma gets this dead serious look. Jake, I think we should break up. I literally choked on my water. I'm sorry. What? She launches into this clearly rehearsed speech about needing passion, intensity, someone who would fight for her. The words sounded completely foreign coming out of her mouth. Stilted, practiced, like she was reading someone else's script. I need to know you do anything for me, she said, staring at the bread basket instead of my face. I need someone who won't.

Monday morning, my boss, Veronica, called me into her office and closed the door behind me, which immediately made my stomach tighten. You need to stop helping other departments, he said. I was confused because I've been doing the quarterly investor reports for three years. Marketing, finance, legal can all handle their own sections now, she said, and her voice had this bitter edge that I'd never heard before. Yesterday, the CEO praised you at the board meeting. Not our department, you personally. She was actually trembling with jealousy, and it made me uncomfortable. That ends now, I reminded her. The CEO specifically asked me to create the quarterly report that investors needed next week. I'll handle that myself, she said confidently. But I knew something she didn't know. She didn't have access to any of the other department systems, and I've been given special permissions over the years that she'd never needed. I'm putting this in writing. She type an email right there and sent it to everyone, including HR. New policy. You will only do work I directly assign. No exceptions. She made me reply all confirming I understood. Perfect. Anyone asks for help, send them to me. I walked out, knowing this would end badly. The quarterly report was due next week. Over the next few days, each department called me about their sections of the quarter early report. I felt terrible telling them Veronica was Handling it now. But I had to follow her written policy. By Thursday, Veronica discovered her problem. She couldn't access any of the systems. I heard her on the phone with it, getting louder and louder. What do you mean, I don't have permissions? She slammed the phone down and came to my desk, looking down. I need your login credentials, she said quietly. That violates company security policy. I said, people get fired for sharing logins. She knew I was right, and her face got red. Then walk me through getting access. She tried your email. Said, I only do assigned work. I reminded her, teaching you isn't on my assignment list. She stood there for a full minute, just staring at me before storming off. By early next week, department heads were getting nervous about the approaching deadline. Veronica kept stalling them with excuses. Then Tuesday morning, the CEO called her directly, and I heard everything through our thin wall. I need the quarterly report tomorrow for the investor call. He said. She's straight up lied to him. Final touches. You'll have it tonight. But she had absolutely nothing, and we both knew it. That afternoon, she tried being clever. I'm assigning you to create the quarterly report, she said casually. I need that in writing, sent to everyone, like your first email, I said. She went pale because she couldn't do it without admitting she'd lied to the CEO. Just this once, she actually begged. Your policy, Says no exceptions, I reminded her. Wednesday morning, hours before the investor call, the CEO walked in with the CFO and HR director. Where's the report? He demanded. Veronica opened her laptop and showed them empty folders. I don't have system access, she finally admitted. The CFO looked shocked. You told us yesterday it was done. You lied. HR was taking notes furiously. Marketing's director appeared, looking angry. She told me she submitted our section. Another lie. Finance arrived next. Same here. The CEO's face turned dark. You lied to me about investor materials

Three months later she was begging me to stop dating. So I'm 26 and single and apparently that's a crime against humanity according to my family. Every Sunday dinner at my parents house turns into this interrogation about my love life. My mom keeps getting me screenshots of her co worker's sons with captions like he's an accountant, stable income. Meanwhile, my sister, who got married at 22, keeps going, your eggs are literally dying. Do you understand that? Every month you wait, is another dead egg. Like, okay, I didn't realize I was a walking cemetery. My dad's the worst, though. He'll literally pause the football game to announce, you know, this lady from church has a nephew who just moved back from dental school. And then my aunt chimes in with her theory that I'm too picky because I rejected her neighbor's son, who, by the way, lives in his mom's basement and collects anime body pillows. The breaking point was Thanksgiving when my grandma grabbed my face with both hands and goes, I want to see great grandchildren before I die. And I have diabetes, so TikTok. My cousin literally set up a Powerpoint presentation called why some people need to lower their standards with actual graphs showing the declining marriage rates for women over 25. My mom starts crying into the mashed potatoes saying she failed as a mother because she didn't teach me how to catch a man. That's when I decided if they want to see me dating so badly, I can date. I post on Craigslist offering 50 bucks plus free dinner for guys to pretend to be my boyfriend at family events. Then I hit up my college theater department's Facebook page. The responses are insane. First dinner I bring a guy who shows up in a full Renaissance Fair gear because I told him to be himself. He performs Shakespeare monologues between courses and calls my mom my lady. She keeps whispering, is he okay? Next week it's a guy from my economics class. He won't stop talking about cryptocurrency. He literally pulls out charts during dessert to explain why my family should invest their retirement in Dogecoin. My dad's eye is twitching the entire time. Week 4 is an older guy who shows up drunk and tries to sell everyone investment opportunities in his friend's food truck. He calls my dad bro 17 times before appetizers. My mom's face is frozen in horror. My favorite was week 6. Guy shows up in a full furry costume because I said dress casually. He keeps his wolf head on during dinner and asks if we have any raw meat. The word spreads through the family group chat that I'm apparently running through men like a common street walker. My mom starts leaving pamphlets for sex addiction on my bed, but I keep going. Week seven I bring this gorgeous guy from the gym who's actually Perfect. He brings wine, compliments my mom's cooking, talks sports with my dad. The whole family is literally glowing. My sister pulls me aside. Finally lock this one down. Then the next week, when I arrive with my date, my mom goes, we're so happy you're back. My date just goes, I've never been here before, ma'am. You must be talking about my twin brother. The silence is deafening. My aunt literally drops her fork and whispers, she's collecting them. After that, my family starts having pre dinner meetings about the situation. This continues for three months. I bring 23 different men total to all family gatherings, each one a calculated disaster. My mom cries and says I'm broken. My sister creates an intervention, complete with pros and cons lists. Where

The principal told him to check which year he was living in. My ex husband Sean had been planning this moment for weeks. Ever since I started dating again last month, he'd been texting his mother about how he was finally going to put me in my place. He even hired a lawyer friend to draft fake emergency custody papers that he kept showing off at his gym. The ink wasn't even dry on our three year old custody agreement before Sean started plotting. He drive by the school during my pickup days, taking photos through the fence and telling his girlfriend he was building evidence. Abigail thinks she owns those kids. He post on Facebook while sitting in his truck. Time someone taught her what real consequences feel like. So there I was, standing in the crowded pickup line at my daughter's school, the whole place buzzing with parents chatting about homework and soccer practice. Sean showed up with two police officers strutting across the parking lot in his pressed khakis and polo shirt, practically glowing with self righteousness. His brother Terry walked beside him, recording everything on his phone. Both of them moving through the crowd like they owned the place. Abby, I hope you're ready for jail, Sean announced loud enough for every parent to hear. You've kidnapped my children for the last time. This ends today. I kept my hands steady at my sides. Watching the other parents step back, let him make his scene. Officers approached slowly. Officer Walker was young, maybe 25, looking uncomfortable. His partner, Officer Lee, seemed tired already. Sean rushed forward before they could even speak. Officers, this woman has stolen my children. It's my custody week and she refuses to return them. I have proof right here. Terry nodded enthusiastically. We've been trying to reach her all week. She's completely unhinged. Officer Walker pulled out his notepad, glancing between us. Ma'am, can you explain what's happening here? Sean's face was already red. Don't let her manipulate you. She's a pathological liar who's been alienating my kids for years. Check her record. She's probably done this before. Mrs. Jones, the principal walked out right then. She was this tiny sixteen year old woman with silver hair and sensible shoes. She looked like she'd rather be inside finishing paperwork. Sean immediately pivoted toward her. Finally, someone with authority. Mrs. Jones, I need my children released immediately. Their mother is violating our custody agreement and I want her arrested for kidnapping. Mrs. Jones adjusted her glasses, looking genuinely puzzled. I'm sorry, Mr. Lewis, but what custody violation are you referring to exactly? Sean's neck veins started showing. My City Week. She took them during my scheduled time. I want them now, and I want her charged. Don't play games with me, Missus. Jones walked back to the entrance and returned with her laptop and a thick Manila folder. She set them On the picnic table near the flagpole, Officer Lee moved closer to look. Sean and Terry exchanged confident glances while I felt my heart hammering. Mister Lewis, she said, slowly opening the folder, according to our records, you haven't had a scheduled custody week in three years. The color in Sean's face went from red to white in seconds. What are you talking about? Mrs. Of Jones turned the laptop screen toward the officers. We maintain detailed custody calendars for all our divorced parents, digital and paper copies. She pulled out a spreadsheet with highlighted sections. You voluntarily gave up your alternating weeks in March

He demanded $500 rent from me. I had just turned 18, but was still in high school. Starting next month, you pay rent, he said, walking into my room without knocking. I looked up for my math homework. But I'm in high school. Doesn't matter. You're 18. Adults pay rent. My mom stood behind him, looking at the floor. Carl thinks it will teach you to be responsible, she said quietly. I only made $600 a month at my grocery store job. He wanted almost all of it. That. That's life, Carl said with a big smile. My son joined the army at 18. You're spoiled. He'd been saying this since he married my mom two years ago. His son was perfect. I was always wrong. If you don't like it, move out, he said. I looked at his smug face and got an idea. Okay, Carl, I'll pay rent. $500 on the first of every month. His smile got bigger. Good. Maybe now you'll grow up. He walked out, thinking he'd won. He had no idea what kind of tenant I was about to become. I gave Carl a check for $500 at breakfast. I need a receipt, I said. Why? Landlords have to give receipts. It's the law. He was annoyed, but wrote one on a napkin. That night I invited three friends over at. At night. We played video games loudly in the living room. Carl ran out in His underwear. What are you doing? It's midnight. I can have guests whenever I want. I pay rent. Mom came out looking tired. Please be quiet. We have work tomorrow. I have tenant rights, I said, turning the volume up. Carl's face turned purple. This is my house, and I'm your tenant. His mouth opened and closed like a fish. Mom them back to their bedroom. The next morning, I went to the hardware store while Carl was at work. I bought a doorknob with a lock for $30 and put it on my bedroom door. When Carl got home, he tried to walk into my room. The door was locked. What is this? Privacy. Tenants get privacy. Take it off. No. If you wanna come in, give me a day's notice. Mom watched from the hallway. Carl grabbed the doorknob hard. You're damaging my room, I said. I'll report you. He let go immediately. Later, the kitchen sink started dripping. I texted Carl, the sink is broken. Fix it in three days or I take the repair cost out of my rent. He showed the text to mom at dinner. Can he do that? Mom looked it up on her phone and nodded. Carl fixed the sink that night, angry the whole time. Then Carl's parents came for dinner. Mom cooked a big meal. Everyone sat down but me. I walked in with a sandwich from the gas station. Why aren't you eating Mom's food? Carl's dad asked. Food Isn't included in my rent. I'm just a tenant. Carl's dad put down his fork. You charge him rent? He's in high school. He needs to learn responsibility, Carl said quietly. His dad stared at him. You charge your wife's son rent while he's in school? Nobody said anything. Carl's dad shook his head. That's terrible. Carl looked at his plate. I ate my sandwich. Carl was losing his mind. He tried to get into my room every day. They fought every night.

My husband started slamming his laptop shut whenever I walked into the room, even when he was supposedly just checking basketball scores. 18 years of marriage, and suddenly this man was acting like a teenager caught watching porn. Every single time I entered the living room, Bam! Laptop closed, chin slam, bedroom shut so fast the screen probably cracked. At first I figured, okay, maybe he's planning some romantic anniversary surprise. But then weeks passed and the behavior got worse and worse. He actually installed one of those privacy screens that makes everything invisible unless you're sitting directly in front of it. Real subtle, honey. Then he installed a new secret browser I'd never seen before. Always full of weather websites whenever I did catch a glimpse. But the late night typing sessions were what really got me spiraling. Two, three, four, 4 in the morning, I could see that blue glow from under our door and hear the crazy fast keyboard typing that stopped the second I even moved in bed. One night, I pretended to be asleep and crept to the door to listen. He was actually whispering while he typed, and I distinctly heard him say, please don't do it under his breath. My thoughts immediately went to bad places, what else makes a grown man whisper desperately at his computer at 3:00am? Online gambling destroying our savings. Affair with someone threatening to expose him. At his firm. Something huge that could end our marriage. The next morning was when it started getting really bad. He started looking absolutely wrecked every morning with 1,000 yards air before he left for work. Our young daughter asked why daddy looks sick all the time. And his law partners called me asking if everything was okay because he'd been falling asleep at the desk. Then I found the sticky note that confused me even more. It was jammed in his jacket pocket. Said throw away kid 4 4 7 responded with yesterday's date. My heart sank because throw away accounts meant one thing. He was doing something he needed to hide. The username had kid in it, which made it so much worse. Was my husband talking to children online using fake names. If this got out, he'd lose his license, we lose everything, and he'd be on a registry. The thought made me wretch, but I needed proof before calling divorce lawyers. I didn't care anymore and went straight for his laptop and found an email account bookmarked and hidden in a folder labeled taxes. Apparently he forgot I do our actual taxes. The drafts contained half written messages starting with things like I know everything feels hopeless, but please wait until tomorrow. The recipients all had usernames with numbers and words like lost or ending in them. But the spreadsheet was what really messed me up. 47 rows of usernames tracking last posted and status. Some Said worried, while others were marked okay, all good and green. This man was maintaining a whole database of minors. And the paranoid secrecy suddenly made horrible sense. That evening when he came home, I wanted answers. After our kids went to bed, I completely lost it. Demanding to know what sick corner of the internet he was living in every night. The man stopped for 10 seconds, then completely broke down, sobbing uglier than I'd ever seen him cry. And finally opened that laptop to explain everything to me. Screen after screen of messages to teenagers on unalive forums. Kids posting goodbye notes at 2:00am. And my husband's paragraphs trying to convince them to stay alive. He'd been doing this every single night for months. Finding kids on the edge and messaging them resources, hotline numbers. He was

I was drawing basketball plays in detention when Mister Hugh picked up my notebook and said, you just mapped out vector physics and probability theory. I thought he was mocking me like everyone else, but his eyes were serious. I'm the dumb kid, I told him. Ask anyone. I've been the class idiot since kindergarten. Couldn't read properly, spelled my own name wrong on tests, got a zero in math once, and the teacher held it up asking, how is this even possible? Someone yelled, give him negative points! And everyone laughed, including her. During group projects, kids would literally cry when paired with me. One girl told her partner, just do his part. He won't understand anyway. She said it right in front of me like I wasn't even human. Parent teacher conferences for torture. Have you considered testing for learning disabilities? Maybe a special school? I've been teaching 20 years and I've never seen a case this severe. My mom would cry in the car afterward. You're not stupid, baby, you're not. But even she looked out for sometimes. By 8th grade, I'd stop trying. Why bother when teachers pre wrote F on my papers before I turned them in? Then Mister Hugh arrived as our substitute. While everyone warned him about the problem kids, he walked past my desk and stopped at my notebook full of diagrams and arrows. What is this? He Flipped through pages of plays I'd drawn from last night. Lakers game. Nothing. This isn't nothing. Explain this to me. He pointed at a complex play I'd mapped. That's where LeBron fakes the pick and roll. But actually, I explained the whole play. How the defense would shift where the opening would appear. You just described angular momentum and predictive analysis. No, I described basketball. He smiled. Same thing. Saturday, 9:00am. Gym. I coach youth basketball, and I need an assistant. I showed up thinking he'd realize his mistake. Instead, he had me analyze his team's plays. See how No. 7 keeps telegraphing his cuts? Said his shoulders dip left before he goes right every time. Mister Hugh started writing on his clipboard. You're describing biomechanical patterns and statistical probability. I'm describing basketball. Let me show you something. He drew a parabola on the whiteboard. What's this? A free throw arc. It's also a quadratic equation. He wrote numbers next to it. The optimal release angle is 45 degrees, but Steph Curry shoots at 50 degrees. Know why? His release point is higher, so he needs a steeper angle to maintain the same entry angle at the rim. You just solved for X in an equation PhD students struggle with. My brain broke, but I can't do math. You've been doing math your whole life. We just called it the wrong thing. He started teaching me everything through basketball. History became the integration of the NBA. Biology was about fast Twitch versus slow twitch. Muscle fibers in different positions. English essays analyzed game footage. If Curry shoots 43% from three, but 38% and guarded tight and the defender is two feet away, what's the expected value of the shot? I calculated it instantly. 1 14 points. So he should shoot. You just did statistics that college students fail. Six weeks later, I raised my hand in regular class and correctly answered a physics question. The room went silent. Someone whispered, did he just. The teacher looked stunned. That's correct. Exactly correct. Parent teacher conferences came. My parents walked in, already apologizing. We know he's struggling. Your son is gifted. Mister Hugh interrupted. My mom laughed nervously. I think you have the wrong student file. No, watch this. He turned to me, explained defensive rotation efficiency using mathematical principles. I lit up explaining help defense angles, rotation timing. How you calculate the probability of successful switches based on player speed and court positioning. My dad's mouth. Fellow, what is happening? Your son has been doing advanced mathematics for years. His brain just processes information through basketball. Once we translated it, everything clicked. My mom started crying. Not the sad tears from before, but something else. He tested into Advanced Placement. Mister Hugh continued all subjects. But mom grabbed my hand. All those teachers who said they were wrong. He was never dumb.

But he had no idea what was waiting for him inside my house. Should I have warned him? Nine years ago, Logan divorced me over a massive misunderstanding. He came home early and saw my gay best friend Julian, helping me try on bridesmaid dresses for his own wedding. Logan saw a man in our bedroom, jumped to conclusions and filed for divorce before I could even explain. I begged him to listen, but he blocked me everywhere. Julian tried, reaching out to nothing. Logan was convinced I cheated and refused to hear the truth. He wouldn't even let me speak at the divorce proceedings. His lawyer did all the talking while Logan sat there stone faced, treating me like I was some stranger who'd betrayed him. The worst part? We'd been together for six years. Six years of building a life together. And he threw it all away without giving me five minutes to explain. I lost everything. Our house, our dog, most of our mutual friends who believed his version of events. So I moved on, took a job at a law firm as a paralegal, worked my way up and eventually went to law school at night. It was brutal, studying until 2:00am while working full time. But I was determined to rebuild myself into someone stronger. That's where I met Asher. He was in my constitutional law study group. Unlike Logan Asher actually listened when I spoke, believed in me, supported my dreams, and never once made me feel like I had to prove my worth. We got married three years ago and now have twin boys who are 4 years old. Fast forward to last Saturday. I'm in my kitchen making pancakes for the boys when the doorbell rings through the peephole. There's Logan with a massive bouquet of roses, looking like he just stepped off a magazine cover. Still handsome, still that cocky smile that used to make my heart race. I opened the door and he launched into this speech. Reyna, I finally Learned the truth about Julian. I ran into him at a conference last month and he told me everything. I realize now that I made a terrible mistake. I'm ready to forgive you and start over. We can have the life we always planned. I stared at him in disbelief. Forgive me? After nine years of silence, after destroying our marriage over his own paranoia, he thinks he can just waltz back in and graciously forgive me for something I never did. That's when Asher appeared behind me, wiping flour off his hands from helping with breakfast. Everything okay, babe? He asked, putting a protective arm around my waist. Our twin boys came running up behind him. Mommy, who's that man? Little Jamie asked, chocolate chips still smeared on his face. Logan's expression went from confident to confused to absolutely horrified. His eyes darted. Between Asher, the boys, and the family photos visible on our hallway wall. You. You're married? You have kids? I smiled sweetly, feeling a satisfaction I didn't expect. Yes, Logan. To someone who actually believes in communication and trust. Someone who lets me explain before jumping to conclusions. Logan stammered. But I thought. I mean, I figured you'd wait, that you'd want to work things out once I Learned the truth. Wait? I laughed, and it came out sharper than I intended. You mean wait nine years for you to accidentally discover what five minutes of conversation could have told you? Wait for you to decide I'm worthy of basic human decency? Asher squeezed my hand, sensing my rising anger. The boys had lost interest and run back to the kitchen, but I could hear them chattering about the strange man with flowers. Reyna, please, Logan said, his confidence crumbling. I know I messed up. But we had something special. We can have that again. We did have something special.

But when my new partner turned out to be a perfect match, she demanded to close it. I should have seen this coming. After 10 years of marriage, our bedroom life had basically flatlined. We'd gone from passionate newlyweds to roommates who maybe got intimate once a month, if I was extremely lucky. Every attempt I made to discuss it got shut down or brushed off. When Sarah sat me down that Tuesday evening, I thought maybe she'd finally want to work on us. Instead, she dropped a bomb. I want to open our marriage. I just stared at her across our kitchen table. What? I'm bored. Honey, it's like eating the same meal every single day for a decade. I love you, but I need something fresh, something exciting again. My ego shattered into pieces. But honestly, part of me was actually relieved. I've been so starved for affection and real intimacy that I'd secretly fantasized about this exact scenario, though I'd never admit it out loud to anyone. We spent the next hour setting detailed ground rules. No one we know personally. Always use Protection without exception. Don't ask, don't tell about specific details. Keep emotions completely out of it. Sarah seemed absolutely giddy with excitement as we talked, like she was planning some amazing vacation. Within 48 hours, she was dressed to the nines in an outfit I hadn't seen in months, practically bouncing as she headed Out for her first tinder date, she came home at 2 a m. With messy hair and that satisfied, glowing expression I hadn't seen on her face in literal years. I pretended to be fast asleep. That's when I decided I absolutely wasn't going to be the pathetic husband sitting at home alone while she had all the fun. I reached out to Emma, someone I've been casually chatting with in my Lego discord server for months. It was funny, genuinely kind, and actually shared my supposedly nerdy hobbies that Sarah always mocked. Our first meet up was supposed to be completely innocent, building a new Lego architecture set together at her cozy apartment. But as we worked on the detailed statue of Liberty set, talking and laughing about everything, something just clicked perfectly. She actually listened intently when I explained the fascinating engineering behind the build. She asked genuine, thoughtful questions about my interests instead of rolling her eyes like Sarah always did. You know, Emma said softly, carefully placing a tiny brick, I've never met someone who can make Lego sound this AB. Totally fascinating. Three hours flew by, like mere minutes. When she leaned against me to get a better angle on the intricate build. My heart raced like I was 16 again and experiencing my first crush. For the next three incredible months, my entire life transformed completely. While Sarah went on her twice weekly dates with random strangers, I spent meaningful time with Emma. We Build complex models together, watch classic movies, have actual deep conversations about our dreams, fears, and future aspirations. She remembered tiny details about my work stress, surprised me with my favorite coffee, and genuinely seemed to enjoy every moment of my company. The physical intimacy was absolutely incredible, too. But it was so much more than just that. Emma made me feel genuinely wanted, truly appreciate. She did. Deeply valued as a person. These were feelings I completely forgotten I deserve to experience in a relationship. Then Emma asked the life changing question. Have you ever seriously thought about leaving your wife? I know the situation is incredibly complicated, but I'm falling hard for you. And I think you might be falling for me, too. She was absolutely right. Somewhere between building our 15th intricate model together and her falling peacefully asleep on my shoulder during a late movie night, I realized.

Did you learn about a student that shocked you? In my many years as a high school teacher, I thought I had seen everything. Until Jake walked into my office straight A student, captain of the debate team, already accepted to Yale. But that morning, he looked like he hadn't slept in days. I need help, he said quietly. But you can't tell anyone. That's when he pulled out his phone and showed me what seemed to be his bank account. Hundred seventy six thousand dollars. My heart stopped. A high schooler with that kind of money? I thought the worst immediately. Drugs, scams, something illegal. Where did this come from? I asked. He sighed. I do homework for people. At first I didn't understand, but then he explained it all. For three years, Jake had been secretly writing essays, solving math problems, even coding projects for other students. But he wasn't copying. He was creating original work. Charging $100 500. Whatever the rich kids would pay. So why are you here then? He hesitated, but then he finally told me the real secret. Jake had been living in his car. His parents kicked him out last year when they found out he made more than them. For an entire year, he showered at school, kept his clothes in his lock. He even did his homework at McDonald's. No one knew. Not his teachers, not his friends. And that $176,000? He was saving it for college. His Yale acceptance. Was real. He had written his own essays, but his parents refused to sign his financial aid forms. So I helped him get legally emancipated. And from there, Jake graduated valedictorian. That money put him through Yale, and today he runs a tutoring program for homeless teens, rich or poor.

But then her expression changed to something I couldn't read. She explained that since I was the only student who showed concern for her well being, she wanted to give me a special choice. I could take the A+ for myself, but she'd tell everyone I ruined the challenge for them. Or I could fail the class, but everyone else would automatically get an A+ for their efforts.

She laughed and shook her head, explaining this was an annual experiment for the psychology class. Before I could respond, another girl burst through the door. Missus Lambert, you need to see this, he said, holding out her phone. On the screen was a photo that made the teacher's face go white. It showed Coach Lambert in the cafeteria kissing Missus Harden.

Missus Lambert grabbed the phone own with shaking hands and stared at the photo. Her face went through about 10 different emotions before settling on rage.

They started taking our vitals, asking us questions about how we felt, if anyone was dizzy or nauseous. Whole time, Miss Robinson stood in the corner, looking absolutely mortified. Then our principal stormed in, his face redder than I'd ever seen it. He walked right up to Miss Robinson, and even though he was trying to whisper, his voice carried across the room.

Everyone was convinced we were dying. Parents started showing up, too, demanding to know what she gave us. More parents arrived as the paramedics continued their examinations, the hallway turning into chaos with worried mothers and fathers demanding answers. After what felt like hours, but was probably 20 minutes, our principal got everyone's attention. Guys, every. Everyone calm down. Your students aren't going to die. All the parents were furious, ready to tear this guy apart. What the hell did you give my daughter? One dad shouted, trying to grab his shirt. Relax. She's gonna be Fine. She just won't get pregnant.

He said, I got a plan. This will be easy money. Trust me. Missus Lambert's husband was Coach Lambert, who taught Jim and coached girls volleyball. Kenji figured he was probably sleeping with one of the volleyball players since he spent so much time with them after school. We decided to start our investigation. That afternoon, during volleyball practice, we snuck into the gym and hid behind the bleachers. With a clear view of the court. Coach Lambert was running drills and yelling at the girls to hustle. He seemed normal at first, but then we noticed he kept touching the team captain's shoulder when explaining plays. The practice went on for an hour, and nothing suspicious happened. We were about to give up when Coach Lambert called the captain, April, into his office. She jogged over, bouncing her ponytail, and followed him inside.

She jogged over, bouncing her ponytail, and followed him inside. Through the window, we could see her tying her hair up in a bun while he made sure no one was looking, then turned off the lights and pulled down the blinds, blocking our view completely. Kenji and I looked at each other, knowing she was giving him the gawk. Gawk three thousand. We quietly left the gym and started heading back to Mrs. Lambert's classroom to claim our A+. We're practically running down the hallway when we heard footsteps behind us. Two kids from our class tackled us to the ground before we could react. They pinned us down while their teammate, Jasmine, sprinted ahead toward Missus Lambert's room. We struggled, but they were bigger and had caught us off guard. By the time we got free and made it to the classroom, Jasmine was already inside talking to the teacher. After Jasmine left, looking smug, I went into the classroom alone. Missus Lambert was sitting at her desk, crying harder than before. I told her what we'd seen with Coach Lambert and April in his office. She thanked me through her tears and said she'd suspected the volleyball team all along. But then I realized something off. I asked her, are you okay? Like, actually okay? Mrs. Lambert looked up at me with surprise. She actually smiled a little through her tears, and Said I was the first student to ask how she was feeling. I apologized for not asking sooner and told her that even though she was a tough teacher, she didn't deserve to be cheated on. She stood up and walked around her desk. Do you still want that A plus? She asked. I said, yeah, of course, because who wouldn't want a free grade? But then her expression changed to something I couldn't read.

I've never seen someone's expression change so fast. Mister Carlos's eyes went wide, his mouth dropped open, and he actually took a step back like Miss Robinson had slapped him. You brought those to school? Mister Carlos said, loud enough the front row to hear. In a candy tin. The two teachers were having this intense, whispered argument while we all sat there trying to figure out what we'd eaten. Some kids were already texting their parents under their desks, worried. We need to get the nurse now! Mr. Carlos said, heading for the door. But Miss Robinson grabbed his arm. Wait! Maybe it's not that bad. Maybe they didn't take enough. But Mr. Carlos yanked his arm free. Are you insane? We're calling the nurse, and you're going to explain this to administration! He stormed out, while Miss Robinson stood there looking like she might faint. Some kids started worrying, too. Did we eat Poison? Are we going to die?

She started pacing back and forth, muttering oh, my god! Over and over while sweat beaded on her forehead. The whole class exchanged nervous glances, because as we definitely eaten the candy, Gabe found the tin in Miss Robinson's bag when she went to the bathroom and passed it around, thinking our teacher wouldn't care about a few missing mints. They for these small white pills that tasted kind of bitter. But we figured they were those fancy European candies she was always talking about from her trips abroad. Who ate them? She was practically screaming now, scanning each of our faces like she was trying to memorize who looked guilty. Please tell me you didn't swallow them. Please tell me you just sucked on them and spit them out. But we all knew nobody spits out candy, especially not when you're trying to sneak it during class.

My parents, thinking they could handle it, made the fatal mistake of letting all the kids inside. How hard could it be? My dad said. Within minutes, our house transformed into complete chaos.

I protested, watching my dad count my babysitting envelope. Cars are luxuries, he said. Pocketing my week's earnings. Family is a necessity.

The footage was damning. Me shopping normally with Ryan. Him calling me daddy multiple times. The woman approaching, grabbing, running. Ryan screaming for me the entire time. Ma'am, you're under arrest for attempted kidnapping. But he's not the father. Look at them. The officer turned to me. Sir, do you wanna press charges? The kidnapper perked up. Yes, I. Absolutely not you. The officer's voice was flat. Sir, I looked at this woman who traumatized my son because she couldn't comprehend mixed families. At her two accomplices who backed her up based on nothing but skin color. Attempted kidnapping, assault on a minor, false imprisonment, filing a false police report. I said, full charges. The other two, the officer asked them too. False reporting. The kidnapper started crying. I was trying to help. I'm a grandmother whose grandmother Sarah asked because you're sure as hell not his. Ryan wouldn't go to preschool for a week. Kept asking if the mean lady would take him again. Started having nightmares about being pulled away from me. The woman pleaded guilty to avoid trial. Six months jail, three years probation. Stirred offender status that prevents her from being near schools or playgrounds. The security footage went viral after someone leaked it. The sound of Ryan screaming daddy while she ran haunted comment sections for weeks. Sarah made me matching T shirts that say, yes, he's my dad and yes, he's my son that we wear to the Grocery store now. Ryan still holds my hand extra tight in public. He's 7 now and sometimes introduces me to new people by saying, this is my daddy. He doesn't look like me, but he is my daddy. Okay. Breaking my heart and filling it up at the same time.

We saw everything. That's my son, I said, holding Ryan, who was sobbing into my shirt. Prove it, the second woman said. I pulled out my phone. Lock screen. Ryan and me at the zoo last month. Photo gallery. Three years of birthday parties, Christmas mornings. First day of preschool. Ryan calling me daddy in videos. Kidnapper still on the floor, pointed at me. Those could be edited. He probably stalks this family. The manager looked overwhelmed. Sir, maybe we should wait for police. Already called them, I said, then dialed. Sarah, Honey, someone just tried to kidnap Ryan. Yeah, at Kroger. Can you bring his birth certificate? Sarah arrived like an avenging angel, still in her pajamas. Ryan practically flew into her arms. Mommy! The mean lady took me. Sarah's eyes went lethal. Who touched my son? The kidnapper started backing away. I was saving him from. From his father. Sarah's voice could have shattered glass. The man who's raised him since he was in diapers. The police arrived. Two officers, one black, one white. The white officer looked at the scene. Elderly white woman on the floor. Three concerned white women. Mixed race man, white woman, white child. What's going on here? The kidnapper spoke first. This man was kidnapping. She grabbed my son and Ran, I interrupted. Check the cameras. While security pulled footage. The black officer looked at Ryan's arms. Red marks where she'd grabbed him. Those are pretty deep bruises forming, he said quietly. The footage was damning me shopping normally with Ryan, him calling me daddy multiple times.

But I knew my daughter, joy, I said, ignoring everyone else, tell me exactly what happened. Her calm face changed a little. That robot Blair's entering tomorrow, Max Bill, the boy from Special Ed who can't talk, my head spined. Blair tried to cut in. We were working together, but the police officer raised his hand to quiet her. Joy kept going, her voice getting stronger. Max spent two years building that robot. It watches his eye movements and turns them into words so he can talk to people. It literally the only way he can communicate. Blair pretended to be his friend three months ago, convinced him they were partners, then changed the code on the lab door so he couldn't get in anymore. Blair's face turned bright red. That's a total lie. I made his simple idea better. I looked at my daughter. What else? Joy got calm again. I asked her to give it back yesterday. I begged her. I told her Max had been hitting himself and having meltdowns for weeks because he was trying to tell people his voice was stolen, but no one understood him. Blair laughed at me. She Said no one would believe the retarded kid anyway. So last night I did what I had to do. The parents outside started looking uncomfortable. This is crazy, Blair shouted. You're really going to believe this jealous liar over me, MIT?

Christian, Jone said, her voice breaking. Christian, it's us! He stood up, backing away, his hands raised. Look, I don't know who Christian is, but this needs to stop. You people have been following me for weeks. Stop it! Jone shouted. Stop pretending you don't know us! He became visibly frustrated. I'm not pretending anything. Your family has been stalking me. So? Woman cornered me at a gas station last week. An old lady sits outside my apartment building every morning, just staring at me. It's getting really creepy. Other people in the office were staring. Now a woman approached. Zachary, is everything okay? Zachary? She said his name was Zachary. He pulled out his wallet, hands shaking, and showed us his driver's license. Zachary Bates, age 29. The birthday was wrong. Everything was wrong except the face. I don't know who Christian is, he said. I've lived here for three years. I moved here from Europe for this job. Joan grabbed the license, staring at it. This is fake. You're Christian. You're his brother. The woman Said, I've known Zachary since he started here. What's going on? I stared at this stranger with my dead brother's face, and the realization crushed me. He really wasn't Christian. He was just a random man who happened to look exactly like him. Living in our town, my mother would never stop looking for Christian in this stranger's face.

Each time, the person would approach, and Christian would turn away or leave quickly. My mother started driving around town searching for him. She'd park outside the coffee shop for hours. Joan confronted him at a gas station, and he threatened to call the police if she didn't leave him alone. She came home hysterical, swearing it was Christian's voice, Christian's eyes, everything. I decided to investigate myself. I mapped out the sightings, found a pattern. He seemed to frequent the same places on a schedule. Tuesday mornings at the coffee shop, Wednesday evenings at the gym, Saturday afternoons at the bookstore. I started following the trail, and it LED to a specific neighborhood on the other side of town. My mother wanted to come, but I convinced her to let me handle it. Joan insisted on joining me. We sat in my car outside an apartment complex where multiple people had seen him. What if it really is Christian? Joan whispered. What if he faked his death? Why would he do that? I asked, though the same thought had crossed my mind. We were a normal family. He had no reason to disappear. At 6:15, we saw him. He walked out of the building carrying a laptop bag, heading for a Gray car. Joan grabbed my arm so hard it hurt. That's him. That's Christian. We followed him to an office building downtown.

Look at this and tell me that's not Christian. She turned the screen toward us. The photo made me dizzy. It was blurry, taken through a coffee shop window. But the man looked exactly like Christian.

Someone who looks similar, maybe. But Christian is gone. My mother started crying. Joan wasn't finished. She swiped to another photo. This was two days ago at the Gym. Tell me that's not our brother.

Three years ago, at my cousin's wedding, I knocked over this girl's drink, reaching across the buffet table. I apologized for 30 seconds straight before realizing she was pointing at her ears and signing something I didn't understand. My cousin texted me later that night. That was Annalise. She lost her hearing from meningitis when she was six. Sent her Instagram. She asked about the guy who kept talking to himself at the buffet. I scrolled through videos of her signing stories. Her face animated and expressive. In one video, she taught basic signs. I watched it over and over, trying to copy her hand movements. Looks so confident, so comfortable in her silence. I messaged her two days later. I'm the idiot who wouldn't stop apologizing at the wedding. Can I buy you a replacement drink? She replied with laughing emojis. You mean the guy who gave a whole speech to a deaf person, then added, yes, but only if you bring a notepad this time? At the coffee shop, we typed messages back and forth on our phones. Annalise told me her parents never Learned ASL after she went deaf. They still think hearing aids solve everything, like glasses for your ears. When she laughed, her whole face lit up. I forgot to read her next message until she waved her hand at me. Stop staring, weirdo. I typed back. Sorry, you're distracting. She rolled her Eyes but mild. We stayed until they kicked us out of closing. After that date, I downloaded every ASL app I could find. I practiced finger spelling during my commute, signed to myself in mirrors. My roommate caught me signing in my sleep. Dude, are you cursing someone out? I was apparently signing banana repeatedly. Annalise sent me daily sign tutorials. Today's phrase, I'm hopeless at this. I sent videos of my attempts. He responded, you just signed, I'm pregnant with fish. Please try again. Within six months, I could hold conversations. Annalise introduced me to her deaf friends at a game night. Everyone signed so fast my eyes couldn't keep. Her friend signed something that made everyone laugh. Annalise translated. She says, you signed with an accent. Like a baby accent. I tried signing back. At least I'm trying. More laughter. Annalise fixed my hands. You just said you're crying. Close enough. Two years in, we moved in together. I was fluent by then. Our apartment peaceful, except for her cat, who meowed at shadows. We signed everything, rarely using our voices. Annalise preferred it that way. Said signing felt more natural than trying to read lips all day. But sometimes, when she was focused on something else, reading or cooking or painting her nails, I started talking out loud to her. Just little things. At first, you look beautiful in that light. She never reacted. Had no idea. Then it became bigger. Confessions. I wanna marry you someday. She kept stirring pasta sauce. You're everything I never knew I needed. She adjusted the heat completely unaware. It became my secret ritual. When she was absorbed in her phone, I'd practice proposing. Annalise, will you marry me? She scrolled through TikTok. I've loved you since you laughed at my terrible signing. She double tapped a video. I bought a ring. It's hidden in my gym bag. She never looked up. I practiced in the shower, in my car. Whenever she couldn't see my lips moving. The words got easier each time. Sometimes I'd tell her about my day, my fears, my dreams. All these one sided conversations she never knew about. One evening, her best friend Graceland visited. They signed rapidly in the kitchen while I pretend to read. I caught pieces of their conversation in my peripheral vision. Annalise was signing emotionally about something. Graceland kept encouraging her. Then I saw it clearly. Annalise signed, I want to propose. But what

My husband Steven forced me to come to his gym's annual pool party. You've really let yourself go. You know, maybe seeing fit people will inspire you to lose weight. That's what he said in the car, so I already knew how this was gonna go. At the party, he introduced me to his workout friends with this is my wife. She used to look like that before she gave up. Then he pointed to a woman in a bikini doing squats by the pool. Everyone went quiet and laughed like it was a joke, then abandoned me to go compare deadlift records with his bros. I just stood alone by the fruit stand, watching him high five guys with eight packs while I tried not to cry. That fruit salad must be fascinating, said a voice behind me. I turned to find Jason, Steven's workout partner I'd heard about but never met. 6 foot 3, built like a professional athlete, but his smile was genuinely warm, not condescending. You're Steven's wife, right? I'm Jason. I've heard absolutely nothing about you. Which, knowing Ste. Even means you're probably the most interesting person here. I laughed despite myself. That's one way to look at it. I'm kitty. Want a beer? He grabbed two actual beers from a cooler, not the protein shakes everyone else clutched and handed me one. We started talking. And it turned out he was launching a consulting firm, desperately needing branding help. I mentioned my design work, and unlike Steven's crew, Jason actually listened. He asked real questions about my creative process, my clients, my inspirations. Wait, you designed that new hotel chain campaign? The minimalist brand? His eyes widened. That's legendary work. I can't believe Steven never mentioned how talented you are. That familiar sting hit. Of course Steven didn't mention it. He hadn't asked about my work in months. He doesn't really ask about my work, I admitted to Jason, and his expression darkened. That's criminal. Creative work takes real talent. He paused, studying me. Can I be honest? Steven's an idiot if he doesn't see what he has. You're absolutely gorgeous. Words hit differently than the backhanded pretty face comments I'd grown used to. I don't really fit in with this crowd. I gestured at the party, suddenly aware I was the only woman still wearing a cover up. Because you have actual substance, Jason said. Because you can hold a conversation about something other than protein powder. I laughed, really laughed, for the first time all day. The afternoon heat was getting brutal. Jason noticed me adjusting my cover up uncomfortably. You know, it's like 90 degrees. You should be comfortable at a pool party, he said gently. Don't let anyone, especially Steven, make you feel like you should hide. Something about his directness made me brave. I pulled off the cover up. Jason Didn't look away or do that polite eyes only thing. He looked at me, actually saw me and smiled. Stunning. Absolutely stunning. Then louder, loud enough for people to hear. Steven, get over here! Your wife's about to cause a traffic accident! Conversations around the pool stopped. Steven's head snapped around from his keto diet discussion. His eyes narrowed, seeing Jason and close to me, me and just my swimsuit, both of us laughing. Everyone was watching now as he practically sprinted over. Babe, there you are. I was just looking for you. He lied, wrapping an arm around my waist like a python. Really? I shot back. Because you've been ignoring me since we got here. His grip tightened. Jason didn't back up an inch.

If you can't respect it, then leave. She tried running our relationship like a dictatorship. I laughed. Consider it done. Left her with nothing but her rules and a laminated sheet. My girlfriend Amanda started with simple rules shoes off by the door, dishes washed immediately after eating. But then she decided these needed to be formalized. I found the first list taped to the fridge. Household guidelines, 10 bullet points covering no eating outside the kitchen. Laundry folded within 30 minutes of drying. I stared at it like a rental contract. So do I need to initial each page? Don't be childish, Vernon. Structure is healthy. This is for us. Except structure was flexible for her, written in stone for me. Eat popcorn on the couch, then freak out when I set my bowl down during a game. By month 3, she started adding updates. Version 2.0, then 3.0, then 5.2. She literally edited them in Google Docs and sent me notifications. I didn't follow them. I'd humor her sometimes, but mostly live normally. When she'd complain about unmade bed corners, I'd say, it's a bed, not a hotel. Her punishment was long speeches about how I lacked discipline. Sit there thinking, you're not my life coach, you're my girlfriend. By year two, we had 37 rules laminated, hung like the Ten Commandments. Gaming limited to one hour per week. Shower schedules so we wouldn't overlap. Water pressure purchases over $20 required approval. While she Bought $180 self care kits. I was paying 80% of rent and most bills, but she acted like she ran the show. She tried controlling my work life, wanting my Google calendar and rewriting my emails. I bought a 25 dollar game without approval. Vernon, you're sabotaging our savings plan! Our savings plan? You mean my paycheck minus your shopping cart? The breaking point came at a restaurant. She planned every meal for the week. When I ordered a burger instead of her Tuesday salmon plan, she put her hand up to stop the waiter. No, he'll have the salmon too. I grinned. No, I'll have the burger. Medium, extra fries. You're embarrassing me. Good. At least we're finally aligned on something. Days later, I came home with pizza. Instead of following her meal plan, she launched into a lecture about my lack of commitment to her system. That's when she screamed, this is my system! If you can't respect it, then leave! I nodded. I ate pizza grease on a napkin. Consider it done. Her face twisted. You wouldn't last a week without me keeping your life together. I didn't argue. Just finished my slice and went to bed, planning my exit. Next morning, she left for Wednesday brunch. I taken the day off while she posted motivational quotes. I was at U Haul. I packed everything. TV, couch, appliances. Nearly everything was mine. I left her laminated rule sheet on the fridge with a sticky note. Per your Request. I've left. Then I called utilities. Since everything was under my name, I scheduled service cuts. Only thing I shut off immediately was internet. Took my modem. First text at four PM. Vernon, where's the tea?

My ex wife gets our daughter Haley every weekend. And every weekend, Haley comes home with a brand new injury. Bruised lip, scraped knee, even a cracked rib once. But the court's only response has been, children need their mothers. last week I was getting ready to go pick her up when I got the call. It was her friend's mom. Haley's at my house in Woodbridge for a sleepover, and her insulin pump just failed. We don't know what to do. Her blood sugar is at 450 and climbing. I felt my stomach drop through the floor. That number should never be above 100. Where's your backup insulin? I asked, already grabbing my keys. She doesn't have any with her. Your wife dropped her off and said everything was in the pump. My hands were shaking as I started my car. My ex always carried the backup insulin in her purse. She made a huge show of it during custody hearings, proving what a prepared mother she was. I called her immediately. She answered with casino noise in the background. Haley's pump failed. She needs insulin now. You're only 15 minutes from the sleepover house. Yes, yes, yes! I just hit an all time record. She responded, our daughter is dying. I yelled, you need to leave now! There was a pause. I can hear dealer voices in the background. I'm at the high roller table. I don't care. What table? I'm down $3,000. I need to win it back. I slammed my hand on the steering wheel, pushing 90 on the highway. Our daughter is going to die. I'm 45 minutes away. You're 15. Then call an ambulance. They don't carry insulin. You know this. Only her prescription pen works. It's in your purse. I'm in the middle of a hand. Give me 20 minutes. Sleepover. Mom texted me a photo at 12:15. Haley unconscious on their bathroom floor, her lips pale, vomit on her shirt. The text said she's over 500 now, barely responsive. I called my ex again, screaming. Now she's dying. Dying? Get in your car. Stop being dramatic and stop calling. You made me lose that hand. The dealer thought I was cheating with signals. That's another 500 gone because of you. I hung up and called 9 1 1, explaining everything through tears. They said they'd meet me there, but confirmed what I already knew. Paramedics can't administer insulin without the option pen. When I finally screeched into their driveway at 12:00am, the ambulance was already there. Haley was on a stretcher, completely unconscious. The paramedic looked grim. Blood sugars too high for our meter to read. We need insulin immediately. My ex has it. She's coming. But she wasn't. Not for another 42 minutes. I tried calling the casino directly. My daughter is dying. My ex wife, Rachel Beckett, is at your high roller table. She has life saving medication. Please make Her leave. Sir, we can't force guests to leave for personal matters. It's not personal. A child is dying. I'm sorry, sir. The paramedics arrived. I begged them to call her, thinking medical professionals would get through. The lead paramedic tried. Ma'am, your daughter is in diabetic ketoacidosis. Her organs are shutting down. I heard her response through his phone. I'm her mother. I'll decide when it's serious enough to leave. When my ex finally strolled through the emergency room doors at 1:20 a m, her designer purse was over her shoulder, reeking of cigarette smoke and wine. Haley was already in the pediatric ICU. She tossed the insulin pen at the nurse like it was nothing. Here. Though you should know, your constant calling made me lose $6,000 tonight. I couldn't speak. Our daughter was on dialysis. The doctor had just

What's the most insane thing you ever experienced? When I was 10, I got placed with the lanes. They seemed normal at first. Nice house, good food. Even gave me my own bedroom with cartoon wallpaper. But something felt weird from day one. They never let me go outside alone, not even to the mailbox. If I wanted to play in the backyard, one of them had to watch me through the window. When I asked why, they said it was for my safety. I figured all foster parents were protective like that. At school, if I got any papers or notes, I had to hand them over the second I walked in the door. They said they needed to check everything for my own good. They locked up my backpack at night and went through it while I slept. I thought this was normal, too. The weirdest thing was the computer. I had one in the living room, but I wasn't allowed to touch it, ever. They said the internet was dangerous for kids. When other kids at school talked about games or videos they saw online, I just nodded along and pretended I knew what they meant. One night, I lost a tooth. Put it under my pillow like always, expecting to wake up to a dollar or some quarters. Instead, I found a tiny folded note written in handwriting I'd never seen before. It said, you're not who they think you are. Check behind the Mirror. I was scared out of my mind. At school the next day, I. I asked my teacher, Missus Kim, if the tooth Fairy ever left notes instead of money. She laughed and said, no, the Tooth Fairy only brings coins. That made me even more confused. That night, while the lanes were downstairs watching their usual cop shows, I carefully pulled the mirror off my bedroom wall. My hands were shaking the whole time. Behind it was a small hole cut into the wall, and inside was a plastic bag stuffed with papers. I pulled everything out. Birth certificates, newspaper clippings, photos of kids who looked like me but weren't me. One photo showed a little girl with my exact eyes, but different hair. Another showed a teenager who could have been my sister. Then I found the missing child flyer. It had a picture of a six year old girl named Sophie Blanchard, missing for four years. The girl in the photo looked exactly like me, just younger. My stomach dropped to the floor. There were handwritten notes, too. They rename all the kids. Tell someone the truth. Call Aunt Jane. She's still looking. I spent the next week acting totally normal, eating dinner and doing homework like nothing happened. But inside, I was freaking out. During lunch at school, I snuck into the classroom and used the phone to call the number written on one of the papers. A woman answered, and when I said the name Sophie Blanchard. She started crying so hard I could barely understand her. She kept asking where I was, if

But they were shocked to learn he is my bio child. And now they're suing for rights. When my best friend Amanda passed away in a car crash, I adopted her eight year old son, Matthew. My parents immediately made it clear he wasn't real family. Amanda and I had been inseparable since college. She was brilliant, funny, and the best person I knew. When she came out as lesbian, nothing changed between us. I was her kid's godfather from day one. The crash happened on a Tuesday. Drunk driver ran a red light. Amanda passed away instantly. Her wife, Caroline, survived three days in the ICU before her injuries took her, too. Matthew was at school when it happened. Didn't hesitate. Matthew needed family, and I love that kid like my own. The adoption process was smooth since I was already his legal guardian. But my parents, they turned ice cold immediately. He's not really your son, mom would say whenever Matthew wasn't around. You're just playing house. He'll never be our grandson. Dad added. Blood matters. They'd give my other kids birthday presents, but skip Matthew entirely. During Christmas, they'd bring gifts for. For the real grandchildren and tell Matthew his were still coming. They never came. Last month, they called about updating their will. We're leaving everything to you and your biological children only, mom said, voice dripping with satisfaction. That Adopted boy gets nothing. We won't have strangers inheriting family money. I was furious. Matthew is my son in every way that matters. He's been through hell, and you're punishing him for being orphan? Blood is blood, honey. He's not our grandson. We barely even know him. That's when I laughed. Actually laughed out loud. What's so funny? Dad snapped. Wanna talk about blood? Let me tell you about blood. Here's what they didn't know. Seven years ago, Amanda couldn't conceive naturally. Multiple miscarriages, medical complications, the works. She and Caroline were devastated. They tried everything. Fertility treatments, IVF, different doctors. Nothing worked. One night, Amanda called me, crying. We want a baby so badly. But Caroline can't carry the term. Would you. Could you be our donor? I didn't even hesitate. Of. Of course. We kept it completely private. Amanda wanted to be Matthew's only parent. Legally, I was just Uncle Paul, who happened to be around a lot. We agreed I'd never interfere with their parenting decisions. The clinic handled everything professionally. Legally, I signed away all parental rights. But emotionally, that kid was mine from the moment he took his first breath. When Amanda and Caroline died, I immediately got DNA tests done. Not because I doubted anything, but because I needed legal documentation for the adoption. The results confirmed what I already knew in my heart. So I invited my parents over for Sunday dinner. Matthew was at his friend's house. I have some news about The inheritance situation, I said, sliding the DNA results across their dining table. Dad picked up the papers, squinting at the scientific jargon. His face went completely white. This says Matthew is your biological son. How is that possible? Mom grabbed the papers. These must be fake. You adopted him after Amanda died. Nope. Amanda couldn't.

Three years ago, at my cousin's wedding, I knocked over this girl's drink, reaching across the buffet table. I apologized for 30 seconds straight before realizing she was pointing at her ears and signing something I didn't understand. My cousin texted me later that night. That was Annalise. She lost her hearing from meningitis when she was six. He sent her Instagram. She asked about the guy who kept talking to himself at the buffet. I scrolled through videos of her signing stories, her face animated and expressive. In one video, she taught basic signs. I watched it over and over, trying to copy her hand movements. Looks so confident, so comfortable in her silence. I messaged her two days later. I'm the idiot who wouldn't stop apologizing at the wedding. Can I buy you a replacement drink? She replied with laughing emojis. You mean the guy who gave a whole speech to a deaf person, then added, yes, but only if you bring a notepad this time? At the coffee shop, we typed messages back and forth on our phones. Annalise told me her parents never Learned ASL after she went deaf. They still think hearing aids solve everything, like glasses for your ears. When she laughed, her whole face lit up. I forgot to read her next message until she waved her hand at me. Stop staring, weirdo. I typed back. Sorry, you're distracting. She rolled Her eyes but smiled. We stayed until they kicked us out of closing. After that date, I downloaded every ASL app I could find. I practiced finger spelling during my commute, signed to myself in mirrors. My roommate caught me signing in my sleep. Dude, are you cursing someone out? I was apparently signing banana repeatedly. Annalise sent me daily sign tutorials. Today's phrase, I'm hopeless at this. I sent videos of my attempts. He responded, you just signed, I'm pregnant with fish. Please try again. Within six months, I could hold conversations. Annalise introduced me to her deaf friends at a game night. Everyone signed so fast my eyes couldn't keep up. Her friend signed something that made everyone laugh. Annalise translated. She says, you signed with an accent. Like a baby accent. I tried signing back. At least I'm trying. More laughter. Annalise fixed my hands. You just said you're crying. Close enough. Two years in, we moved in together. I was fluent by then. Our apartment peaceful, except for her cat, who meowed at shadows. We signed everything, rarely using our voices. Annalise preferred it that way. Said signing felt more natural than trying to read lips all day. But sometimes, when she was focused on something else, reading or cooking or painting her nails. I started talking out loud to her. Just little things. At first. You look beautiful in that light. She never reacted. Had no idea. Then it became bigger. Confessions. I want to Marry you someday. She kept stirring pasta sauce. You're everything I never knew I needed. She adjusted the heat completely unaware. It became my secret ritual. When she was absorbed in her phone, I'd practice posing. Annalise, will you marry me? She scrolled through TikTok. I've loved you since you laughed at my terrible signing. She double tapped a video. I bought a ring. It's hidden in my gym bag. She never looked up. I practiced in the shower, in my car.

Meredith was the girl who somehow always knew when you needed her. Since freshman year, everyone knew Meredith as the human embodiment of sunshine who'd drop everything to help anyone. She'd show up at your locker with tissues before you even realized you were about to cry. Bring extra lunch when she sensed you forgot yours. And somehow convinced everyone that caring about others was the coolest thing you could do. The crazy part was, it worked. Even the toughest kids softened around Meredith. I remember this one time in calculus when Peter was having a full breakdown about his parents'divorce. Meredith literally got up mid test and sat with him in the hallway for 40 minutes. The teacher didn't even Mark her absent. That was Meredith's superpower. She made helping people look effortless. That's why when she walked into school that Monday after Caden's party looking like someone had drained all the color from her life, everyone noticed. Not dramatically different. Meredith just emptied out. Meredith. She walked past Peter without acknowledging his wave, ignored the freshman she'd been tutoring who called out her name, sat alone at the back corner table where nobody ever sat. Caden, my best friend since elementary school, shrugged it off. Maybe she finally realized being everyone's therapist isn't a personality. The other guys laughed. I forced myself to laugh, too. But something felt wrong about how satisfied Caden looked. Meredith had been wearing black For three weeks straight. Not goth black or trying to make a statement black. Just absence of color black. She'd stopped answering texts, deleted her Instagram, where she used to post daily motivational quotes, and moved seats in every class to be as far from everyone as possible. The school felt different without Meredith's energy. Kids started snapping at each other more. The freshman she tutored failed his algebra test. Peter started skipping classes. Even teachers seemed more irritable, though they'd never admit Meredith's mood affected them. I tried talking to her after English. She looked at me like I was speaking another language and kept walking. Caden watched from down the hall. This weird little smile on his face. Told you she was fake. Nobody's that nice without wanting something. Other kids had theories. Maybe someone in her family died. Maybe she got rejected from her dream college. Maybe she was depressed and needed the same help she'd given everyone else. But when people tried to return her kindness, she'd physically recoil, like their concern burned her. Week 4 arrived, and Meredith hadn't spoken to anyone. She'd become a ghost, haunting her own life. Then Thursday happened. I was heading to the bathroom during history when I heard crying from the old music room nobody used anymore. The door was cracked open, and I saw Meredith curled up on the floor, shaking. Not crying. Shaking. Like her body was trying to escape itself. I went in and sat down. Not too close. We sat in silence for 10 minutes before she spoke. Caden has videos of me. The words came out broken, like she had to force each one through her throat. From his party. I trusted him. Because he was your friend. I got drunk and went to lie down in his sister's room. I woke up at 4 a m. And my shirt was unbuttoned. My skirt was pulled up. There were lights set up, camera equipment. She showed me her phone. Screenshots of texts from unknown numbers, close up photos of her unconscious body. Threats about what would happen if she told anyone, messages.

My brother smirked and said, we voted. You're no longer part of the family. Everyone laughed. I simply nodded and stood up. Moments later, they realized what I had done, and chaos broke out. The first thing I noticed when I walked in that night was the silence. Not the calm kind, the suffocating kind. Like I'd already broken some rule just by showing up. Mom stirred gravy without looking up. Dad muttered a flat hey from behind his paper eyes, never leaving the print. No hug, no warmth. Just acknowledgement. Like I was a stranger they weren't thrilled to host. And then there was Kyle, my brother. The golden child. His smirk met me at the doorway. The same smirk he wore when I got grounded for things he did, when my achievements were ignored, when he stole the spotlight every single time. I told myself to breathe, to get through dinner without taking the bait. But I should have known better. Dessert plates clinked, coffee steamed. For a few minutes, conversation flowed. Work gossip, holiday sales. Who burned the Turkey last year? I let myself believe maybe this year wouldn't end in humiliation. Then Kyle tapped his fork against his glass like he was about to make a toast. Hey, Jason, he drawled. We had a vote. I frowned. A vote? He leaned back in his chair, grinning like he'd been waiting all night for this. Yeah, you weren't here last week, so we decided without You unanimous. You're no longer part of the family. The table erupted in laughter. Cousins chuckled nervously. Aunt smirked behind their wine glasses. Even my parents let out weak laughs, eyes sliding away from mine. My chest tightened. The sound of their laughter felt louder than it was buzzing in my ears until I thought I might break. Well, I whispered, nodding slowly, that's nice. Kyle raised his glass higher. Should have been here for the vote. My chair screeched against the floor as I stood. The sound cut through their laughter. Jason? Mom started, her voice faltering, but I grabbed my coat. You're not really leaving, are you? Dad asked, his tone low warning. I turned back once. Steady now. You voted. I'm just honoring it. The slam of the front door swallowed the silence behind me. The days that followed blurred my. My phone lit up with half hearted apologies, excuses about just a joke, and messages begging me not to overreact. I ignored them. What they didn't realize was simple. For years, I had been their safety net. I floated the mortgage, paid off Kyle's business loans, quietly covered medical bills, utilities. That's. They laughed me out of the family, but they were standing on a foundation I built. If they wanted me gone, I'd make sure they felt it. Two weeks later, I invited them all to dinner. Mom, dad, Kyle, the extended family. They arrived tense, confused, the table filled with clinking silverware and forced Conversation! Kyle broke the silence, first raising his glass with a sneer. To family, he said. I smiled

I was five years into my practice when they assigned me the case that still keeps me awake at night. Eric Walsh, 19 years old. Accused of assaulting a girl named Jessica at some house party. Kid looked terrified when they brought him into the room. Kept saying over and over that he didn't do it. Jessica's story was intense. He gave all these specific details about what happened, crying the whole time. Said Eric cornered her in the bathroom. Described exactly what he was wearing. Even remembered the song playing downstairs. It felt real, you know? But then I started digging deeper. Eric had three friends who swore he left the party early to grab cigarettes from a gas station across town. Tracked down the security footage from that night. There he was, clear as day, buying Marlboroughs at exactly the time Jessica said he attacked her. The time stamp showed 11:47 p m. Jessica claimed the assault happened at 11:45. I spent weeks building Eric's defense. Found more witnesses who remembered him leaving. Got phone records showing he called his mom from the gas station. Even found the receipt in his jacket pocket. Everything pointed to his innocence. During cross examination, Jessica's story started falling apart. She couldn't explain how Eric could be in two places at once. Her friends admitted they hadn't actually seen him at the party that late. The prosecutor looked defeated when I presented the footage. The judge dismissed all charges. Jessica got charged with filing a false report. Eric broke down crying right there in the courtroom. Hugged me so tight, I thought he might crack my ribs. He kept saying I saved his life, that nobody would have believed him without me. I felt good about it. Really good. Here was this innocent kid who almost got destroyed by false accusations, and I'd proven the truth. That's what lawyers are supposed to do, right? Two years later, I was having coffee before work when I saw Eric's mug shot on the morning news. Multiple victims this time. Three college girls. They had video evidence, DNA, everything. He'd confessed to all of it during questioning. But what he said during that confession is what haunts me. He told the detective that getting falsely accused the first time had changed him. Said he felt humiliated, angry at the system. Said if everyone was going to treat him like a monster anyway, maybe he should give them something real to be scared of. My phone started ringing within an hour. Reporters wanting to know how I felt about defending him. One victim's father called me directly, screaming that I had blood on my hands. Asked me how I could sleep at night knowing I'd helped a rapist walk free. The thing is, I still believe Eric was innocent the first time. The evidence was solid. But somehow, fighting so hard to clear his name had planted this Sick idea in his head that the world owed him something

Our middle school had always been pretty relaxed about phones until three eighth graders live streamed themselves destroying the second floor bathroom for a prank. The very next day, the principal announced the harshest policy any school in our district had ever seen. Absolutely zero phones or electronics on school property. No exceptions. Not even if we kept them turned off. They literally hired extra security guards just to search every single backpack at the entrance, confiscating our phones like we were entering a maximum security prison. The searching process would make everyone late, create massive lines in the rain, and turn teachers into prison guards who spent more time hunting for hidden phones than T. I watched as kids who needed phones for medical alerts, anxiety apps, or insulin monitors got told, too bad, so sad. Our principal was convinced that if even one phone got through, it would corrupt the entire school and turn all of us into few to prank. Youtubers. Whatever. I never really cared. But then our school announced a field trip for our class, and my parents absolutely refused to let me leave town without a way to contact them. Then my mom got her brilliant idea. She decided to secretly sneak a phone by taping it to my left ankle and told me to keep it hidden. Don't hesitate to use it in an emergency. My mom said I'd never broken a Real rule before, so this was nerve wracking for me. My heart was pounding so hard during the security check, I thought everyone could hear it, but the guard just waved me through after checking my empty backpack. As we loaded onto bus 1:05, the oldest one in the fleet, with windows that didn't open and emergency exits that everyone knew were painted shut, I felt the phone pressing against my ankle like a secret lifeline. I also noticed how our driver, Mister Pete, kept rubbing his chest and popping antacids. I thought nothing of it. I just focused on staying silent and made sure no one, not even my friends, would suspect that I was breaking the rules. Then, out of nowhere, everything just went completely wrong. 20 minutes into the drive, as our bus was driving over a bridge, Mister Pete made a strange gasping sound and slumped forward onto the steering wheel. His foot somehow jammed harder on the accelerator, and the bus lurched right, smashing through the rusty guardrail like it was paper. We were airborne for two endless seconds before hitting the river with an impact that threw everyone forward. Water started rushing in immediately through the broken windshield, and the bus began tilting nose down into the deep water. Everyone immediately started screaming for help. I saw a kid go unconscious because he hit his head on the roof and his blood was mixing with the water, which only scared us even more. Other Kids were piled on top of each other in the front, pressed against windows that wouldn't break no matter how hard we hit them. Emergency exits that were painted shut wouldn't budge even with six of us pushing. The back door was electronic, and without power, it was locked tight, trapping us in a metal coffin that was sinking lower and lower. Water was already up to our wastes and rising fast. Someone was crying that they couldn't swim. Others were screaming for their parents. And I realized with crystal clarity that we had maybe three minutes before the bus was completely submerged. That's when I remembered the phone. My secret lifeline. I bent down to rip it from my ankle and

I was speed running Minecraft at 3:00am when someone joined my discord with no profile picture, just the username please help me 2024. Before I could kick them for the spam looking name, I heard heavy breathing and what sounded like running through trees. This wasn't a gaming headset, it was someone on their phone actually running through wood in real life. Is anyone there? Please? I need gamers specifically. You're the only ones awake right now who might believe me. It was a girl, maybe 16 or 17. Completely out of breath. My first instinct was to disconnect. This had to be some elaborate ARG or prank. But then I heard something that made my blood freeze. Dogs barking. Not normal barking. Police dog. I escaped from a conversion therapy camp in Utah. She gasped. They told my parents I ran away three weeks ago, but I've been locked in solitary. I stole a counselor's phone when they came to give me food. I remembered this discord server from before they took me. My chat explode. Twelve viewers suddenly became 50, then 100 as people started sharing the stream. Someone typed F A K E. But then we all heard it. A man's voice shouting in the distance. He went this way! Check sector 7! They're hunting me like an animal! She whispered. These camps are legal because parents sign custody over. If they catch me, I disappear. Forever. Other kids have disappeared. That's when my viewer Kevin, a tech genius from Seattle, spoke up. Turn on your location sharing now. Screenshot and send it to the chat. She did. Middle of nowhere, Utah, 40 miles from the nearest town. Kevin immediately started working magic. I'm overlaying your position with Google Earth. There's a road 800 meters northeast. Head that way. How do you know this is real? Someone challenged. The girl, laughed bitterly. Google Wilderness Reformation Academy, Utah. Check their reviews. Parents praising them for fixing their kids. Kids who never post anything again. After my viewer count hit 500, someone had already clipped this and it was spreading across Twitter. But we had a bigger problem. Battery at 12%, she said. And I can hear the dogs getting and closer. That's when the stream chat became Mission Control. Sarah from Germany found an Uber driver forum for Utah. Marcus from Japan was Google Earthing escape route. Tony from New York was documenting everything for evidence. And Kevin. Kevin did something insane. I'm spoofing a 9 1 1 call from the camp's main building, he announced, reporting a fire in the administration office. Should pull their security team back with in minutes. We heard distant sirens through her phone. The shouting changed direction, moving away from her. The road! She gasped. I can see the road, but it was empty. Middle of the night, middle of nowhere. That's when viewer Emma from Colorado typed, my sister lives in Cedar City. That's 45 minutes away. She's getting in her car right now. The next 20 minutes were the longest of my life. Her phone died, but not before she sent one last message. White Honda Civic. License plate starts with Q7. The stream chat stayed active all night, waiting, praying, sharing stories of their own experiences, or close calls with these camps. At 7 a M

My eight year old son was having nightmares about his math teacher. She makes me stay after class and says I'm stupid, he whispered one night, tears streaming down his face. His little body trembled as he described how she'd make him erase and redo his work repeatedly while other kids went to recess. I was skeptical at first. Missus Whittaker had excellent reviews and a teaching award displayed prominently in her classroom. Parents fought to get their kids into her class. But when Jake's grades plummeted and he started faking stomachaches every morning, I knew something was wrong. The final straw was finding him hiding in his closet on a Monday morning, clutching his math workbook. And please don't make me go, mom. Please. His voice was so small, it broke my heart. My husband thought Jake was exaggerating. Kids don't like strict teachers, he said with a shrug. She's probably just pushing him to excel. At the parent teacher conference that week, Missus Whittaker was all smiles and professionalism in front of my husband. Jake just needs to apply himself more. He gets distracted easily. Her voice was honey sweet as she showed us his sloppy work. I caught something my husband missed. The way Jake physically recoiled when she reached toward him as if expecting a strike. On our way out, she placed her hand on Jake's shoulder and squeezed. Work harder next week, won't we? The fear in his Eyes confirmed everything. The principal dismissed my concerns without evidence. She's been here 20 years, Missus Collins. We've never had a complaint. He leaned back in his chair, barely hiding his annoyance. Children sometimes misinterpret constructive criticism as personal attacks. That night, I researched my options while Jake slept bitfully in our bed. Switching classes mid year wasn't allowed. Homeschooling would take weeks to arrange, the school board wouldn't act without proof, and it would be my son's word against a respected teachers. So I bought a tiny voice recorder and carefully put it into the inner pocket of Jake's backpack. I showed him how to press the button under his desk each morning, making it seem like a secret game between. This is just to help me understand your day better, I explained, feeling slightly guilty about making him complicit. Our little secret. Okay. Three days later, I had what I needed. The recording captured Missus Whittaker's sweet voice while other teachers were present. But when alone with struggling students, she transformed. Are you stupid or just lazy? She hissed at my son. Your mother must be so embarrassed to have such a worthless student. There were sounds of papers being crumpled, a ruler slapping against a desk, and worst of all, my son's muffled crying. Instead of confronting her directly, which would give her a chance to deny everything, I devised a plan. The monthly school board meeting was coming up. Usually a boring affair.

So my sister Jenna finally got married last weekend after being engaged for, like, two years. I was honestly excited to be her bridesmaid because we'd gotten closer recently after years of barely talking. The whole ceremony was beautiful. She looked amazing in this vintage dress she found at some boutique, and her husband Kyle seemed genuinely happy. Everything was going perfectly until the reception. The maid of honor is Jenna's college roommate, Rachel, and I've never really clicked with her. She's one of those people who thinks being brutally honest is a personality trait. During dinner, she gets up to give her speech with this huge smile on her face. She starts off normal, talking about how she met Jenna in their dorm freshman year and all their adventures together. Then she goes, and I have to mention Jenna's little sister, Emma, who's sitting right there looking so pretty tonight. Everyone turns to look at me, and I'm thinking, this is actually sweet. But then Rachel continues. You know, Emma's had such a rough few years. We all thought she'd never get her life together after that whole mental health breakdown and dropping out of college. But look at her now. She managed to show up on time, didn't trip walking down the aisle, and hasn't had a panic attack yet. It's like watching a baby deer learn to walk, but she's getting there. The entire room starts laughing. My aunt covers her mouth, trying not to giggle. My cousin Jake is literally snorting. Even some of Kyle's family, who barely know me, are chuckling. I felt my face get hot, and my stomach dropped to the floor. Rachel just keeps going. Jenna always believed in her sister, even when the rest of us weren't so sure. It's so heartwarming to see Emma finally doing something right for once. I tried to keep smiling, but my hands started shaking. See, what Rachel was talking about was true. I did have a breakdown two years ago. I was failing my classes, couldn't get out of bed some days, and eventually had to drop out of college. My parents spent thousands on therapy, and I moved back home for eight months. It was the darkest time of my life, and I'm still taking medication for anxiety and depression. I've been working so hard to get back on track. I'm taking classes part time now and working at a coffee shop downtown. I even started dating this guy, Matt, who actually makes me feel good about myself. But hearing Rachel reduce all my struggles to some punchline in front of everyone I care about was devastating. The worst part was watching my extended family's faces. My grandma looked confused, like she didn't know about my problems. My uncle, who I look up to, was staring down at his plate. Even Kyle's parents seemed uncomfortable, but they were Still smiling politely, I could feel tears starting, so I excused myself and went outside to the hotel parking lot. I sat on the curb behind some cars and just sobbed. All those months of therapy telling me I'm not defined by my worst moments, and here's Rachel basically announcing to everyone that I'm the family screw up who finally managed not to mess something up. Jenna came looking for me about 10 minutes later.

Three pregnancy tests lined up on my bathroom counter, all positive. I couldn't believe the timing. My boyfriend's birthday was in two days, and this was the best present I could ever give him. I threw on my coat and rushed to target before they closed and immediately started crying when I found a tiny Dodgers onesie in the baby section. Remembering how my boyfriend Dylan talked about teaching his own kid on the field someday, I stuffed the onesie and pregnancy tests and happy birthday bag and headed to his apartment. I wasn't prepared to be the one that got surprised. When I got to his door, I could hear voices inside, and I figured it could have been anyone until I heard that laugh. That specific laugh that once tormented me in college. It was Paige, his ex. She answered the door wearing his old baseball Jersey, the one he'd never let me touch. Her hand immediately went to her stomach as she marked at me. I felt all the color drain from my face. Oh, god, she was pregnant. Like, several months pregnant. Dylan appeared behind her and instantly went just as pale. Before he could say anything, Paige stepped in. We've been back together since Christmas, she said, rubbing her belly. He didn't tell you? We've been living together this week, preparing for the baby. F me Christmas, we'd Spent New Year's Eve together, Valentine's Day, even my birthday. All those chances to end things and tell me the truth, only to knock me up too. This evil jerk. I took a deep breath and set the gift bag down on his doorstep. Happy early birthday. On my way home, he called me over and over, but I refused to answer. I blocked him everywhere, even blocked his family, and blocked anyone who tried to help him reach out to me. I moved in with my cousin, hoping for a do over. Portland was perfect for starting over. Grey and rainy, and nobody knew me. I got a job that didn't care about my pregnancy and found a doctor who didn't judge when I said there was no father involved. Everything was good. But it was at the prenatal classes where things just rapidly escalated for me. An exhausted guy named Carter walked in late to class carrying a Newborn. Sorry, he said to the instructor. Caitlin had a rough night. You can pair up with her, the instructor said, pointing at me, the only other single parent in the room. During the diaper demonstration, his. This doll's head fell off and he just stared at it. Three months in and I still can't keep a fake baby together, he muttered, frustrated at himself. I laughed and helped him reattach the head. She looks pretty healthy for someone whose dad can't work a practice doll, I said. He smiled in appreciation. I'm just glad babies are a lot sturdier than this thing. We joked around with each other a bit more before Carter sighed and said with a sad expression, her mother would have been amazing at this if she. We're still here. I reached out and put my hand over his. You're amazing enough now. Don't lose confidence. You're my partner here. He sat up straight and gave the practice another go. We started getting coffee after class. He needed help figuring out his daughter Caitlin's sleep schedule, and I needed someone who didn't look at me with pity. We just talked about normal stuff, baby products and pediatricians and whether organic formula was worth the price. But after a couple of weeks, things shifted. We started hanging out as friends, even calling each other husband and wife when strangers asked. He started coming to my appointments when I mentioned being nervous about going alone, held my hand during the 36 week ultrasound, built the crib I'd ordered online because I couldn't figure out the instructions all while.

Then Karma showed up right on time. I have this friend who I've known for eight years, and she's amazing when she's actually there. But that's the problem. She's never there on time. We're talking 45 minutes minimum, late to everything. And it's not just occasionally. It's literally every single time, without fail. She genuinely doesn't think it matters. One time, she had our tickets to Hamilton on her phone because she insisted on buying them together for the discount, but showed up 45 minutes late so they wouldn't let us in until intermission. Last month, she was supposed to drive me to the airport for my best friend's destination wedding and showed up so late that I missed my flight. I had to buy a new ticket for $800 and missed the rehearsal dinner where they announced I was the maid of honor. Then there was my dad's funeral. She offered to drive me. I thought this time would be different, but she picked me up 40 minutes late. By the time we walked in, the service was halfway done, and my entire family turned to stare at me. Walking in late to my own father's funeral. My aunt shook her head at me, my cousins whispered to each other, and my mom wouldn't even look at me. Afterwards, when I tried to explain, my uncle said, your father deserved better. Now half my family won't talk to me because They think I couldn't even respect my dad enough to be on time to his funeral. So I sit her down at this coffee shop, and of course, she's 35 minutes late to this conversation about being late. I tell her straight up that her lateness is ruining our friendship and making everyone feel disrespected, but she just laughs and says, that's just who I am, you know, I run on my own schedule. It's not personal. I try explaining that it feels personal when eight people are sitting at a restaurant waiting for her, but she cuts me off and goes, maybe you should just tell people an earlier time for me, like parents do with kids, and actually laughs like it's clever. Then she immediately starts talking about her boyfriend drama. That's when I realized she's never going to get it by me just telling her. I have to show her. I create a group chat without her called operation finally on time and explain my plan to everyone. Phase 1 is controlling what she misses when she's late to group events by doing all the important stuff first. Phase 2 is having everyone show up late to her events so she I can feel what it's like. Everyone immediately agrees because they're all fed up. And I start planning her surprise birthday party for next month. Three weeks before her party, I start small with game night, where we play her favorite game first, and she walks In to find us putting it away at brunch. We order and eat her favorite appetizer before she gets there, and she's confused why we didn't wait. She wanted concert tickets to her favorite band, but I gave them to someone else because I needed someone who could actually make it on time. She's getting irritated but doesn't connect the dots yet, actually complaining that we're being weird about time lately. Zero self awareness. Meanwhile, I coordinate with everyone for Phase 2. She invites us all to her boyfriend's band show, which is super important to her. Everyone agrees to come, but secretly plans to be 45 minutes late. The night of her boyfriend's show, she's there on time for once, sitting alone at empty table.

The words got easier each time. Sometimes I'd tell her about my day, my fears, my dreams. All these one sided conversations she never knew about. One evening, her best friend Graceland visited. They signed rapidly in the kitchen while I pretended to read. I caught pieces of their conversation in my peripheral vision. Annalise was signing emotionally about something. Graceland kept encouraging her. Then I saw it clearly. Annalise signed, I want to propose. But what if he's not ready? We never discuss marriage. Graceland signed back, maybe he's waiting for you to bring it up. Annalise responded, I've been carrying a ring for two months. I'm scared he'll say no. That night, Annalise was washing her face in the bathroom. I stood in the doorway and said clearly, I know you want to propose. She patted her face dry. I saw you signing with Gracelyn earlier. She applied moisturizer. I've been practicing proposing to you for eight months. She brushed her hair. The ring is in my gym bag. I was planning to ask next Saturday at the farmers market where we had our fifth day. She turned off the light, walking past me. The next morning, she was making coffee, facing away from me. I pulled the ring from my gym bag and set it on the counter. Then I said out loud, I love you, Annalise. I've been telling you that for months. When you Weren't looking every day, sometimes twice. She reached for her mug. Turn around. When she did, she saw the ring box. Her eyes went wide. She signed frantically. What? How did I signed? Slowly, clearly. I've been practicing. Then I spoke, knowing she'd read my lips. Will you marry me? She started cry, signing yes before pulling her own ring from her purse.

Julie, Sweetheart, Jessica's lawyer said, I know this is scary, but can you tell the judge what you told your mommy and Grandma? Julie's little voice shook. Daddy. Daddy touches me in bad places. The courtroom gasped. Just. Jessica dabbed her eyes. My mother reached over to squeeze Jessica's hand in support. Where does he touch you? Julie pointed to her private areas. There, he says it's our special secret. I felt my lawyer's hand on my arm, keeping me seated. My siblings were staring at me in Horror. How long has this been happening? Julie? A long time. He said if I told anyone, mommy would get hurt. Jessica broke into performative sobs. The CPS workers were furiously taking notes. The judge's face had turned to Stone. Julie, one last question. The lawyer continued. Do you feel safe with your daddy? Julie start crying. Coached tears. No. I'm scared of him. I want to live with mommy and grandma forever. No further questions. The judge looked at my lawyer. Does the defense wish to cross examine? Your honor, my lawyer stood. Before we proceed, we need to submit critical evidence that will recontextualize this testimony.

I almost swerved off the road watching my daughter smile about how she was going to ruin my life in 3 weeks time. The surprise build A bear I bought her was laughing at me from the back seat. The photos of Julie my mother had sent earlier now seemed contaminated. But instead of getting angry and acting on impulse like college me would have, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I sewed a recording device into the build A bear before driving home. Grandma's here! Julie squealed when I walked through the door twenty minutes later, running to me with the same innocent face that had just been rehearsing my destruction. I know, sweetheart, I said, handing her the build A bear. Mr. Snuggles has a new friend for you. My mother smiled that grandmother smile I'd trusted for 42 years. You spoil her, Daniel. How was work? The usual. I kissed Julie's forehead, my stomach churning. Thanks for watching her, mom. Over the next two and a half weeks, became the world's greatest actor. I installed cameras in Julie's dollhouse, her jewelry box, even inside the old tablet. She used for games. Every device was legally purchased and placed in my own home. And items I bought.

My mother brought Disney brochures to my daughter for after the bad man goes away, she whispered Julie, who was ecstatic about the holiday and seemed to have no idea of the consequences she was doing.

Three years ago, at my cousin's wedding, I knocked over this girl's drink, reaching across the buffet table. I apologized for 30 seconds straight before realizing she was pointing at her ears and signing something I didn't understand. My cousin texted me later that night. That was Annalise. She lost her hearing from meningitis when she was six. He sent her Instagram. She asked about the guy who kept talking to himself at the buffet. I scrolled through videos of her signing stories, her face animated and express. In one video, she taught basic signs. I watched it over and over, trying to copy her hand movements. She looks so confident, so comfortable in her silence. I messaged her two days later. I'm the idiot who wouldn't stop apologizing at the wedding. Can I buy you a replacement drink? She replied with laughing emojis. You mean the guy who gave a whole speech to a deaf person, then added, yes, but only if you bring a notepad this time? At the coffee shop, we typed messages back and forth on our phones. Annalise told me her parents never Learned ASL after she went deaf. They still think hearing aids solve everything, like glasses for your ears. When she laughed, her whole face lit up. I forgot to read her next message until she waved her hand at me. Stop staring, weirdo! I typed back. Sorry, you're distracting. She Rolled her eyes but smiled. We stayed until they kicked us out of closing. After that date, I downloaded every ASL app I could find. I practiced finger spelling during my commute. Signed to myself in mirrors. My roommate caught me signing in my sleep. Dude, are you cursing someone out? I was apparently signing banana repeatedly. Annalise sent me daily sign tutorials. Today's phrase I'm hopeless at this. I sent videos of my attack.

Our middle school had always been pretty relaxed about phones until three eighth graders live streamed themselves destroying the second floor bathroom for a prank. The very next day, the principal announced the harshest policy any school in our district had ever seen. Absolutely zero phones or electronics on school property. No exceptions. Not even if we kept them turned off. They literally hired extra security guards just to search every single backpack at the entrance, confiscating our phones like we were entering a maximum security prison. The searching process would make everyone late, create massive lines in the rain, and turn teachers into prison guards who spent more time hunting for hidden phones than I watched as kids who needed phones for medical alerts, anxiety apps, or insulin monitors got told, too bad, so sad. Our principal was convinced that if even one phone got through, it would corrupt the entire school and turn all of us into future prank Youtubers. Whatever. I never really cared. But then our school announced a field trip for our class, and my parents absolutely refused to let me leave town without a way to contact them. Then my mom got her brilliant idea. She decided to secretly sneak a phone by taping it to my left ankle and told me to keep it. Don't hesitate to use it in an emergency. My mom said I'd never broken a real rule before. So this was nerve wracking for me. My heart was pounding so hard during the security check that I thought everyone could hear it. But the guard just waved me through after checking my empty backpack as we loaded onto bus 1:05, the oldest one in the fleet.

My sixteen year old Valentina had never shown interest in languages. She barely passed English class and once told me learning foreign languages was pointless torture designed by sadistic teachers. But exactly three weeks ago, everything changed. Overnight she started going crazy about learning Spanish with books and Duolingo. Since when do you care about Spanish? I asked over dinner Tuesday night, watching her scribble verb conjugations on napkins between bites of pasta. College applications look way better with a second language, Dad. Yale and Harvard basically require it now, she said, completely avoiding eye contact and fidgeting with her fork nervously. Fair enough reasoning, but then incredibly weird things started happening that made zero sense. I heard her having full conversations on the phone in absolutely perfect Spanish. Not broken beginner Spanish with grammar mistakes. Fluent, rapid fire, native level Spanish with complex slang and regional accents. The kind you definitely don't learn from Duolingo. In three weeks, I secretly checked her browser history expecting tons of language learning websites and online Spanish courses. Absolutely nothing. Just regular teenage stuff. TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, makeup tutorial, Amazon shopping. No Duolingo progress. No Spanish websites, no online classes anywhere. One morning around 7 a. M. I heard Valentina on Facetime speaking to someone in incredibly rapid Spanish, laughing hysterically and using slang expressions I didn't recognize. When she suddenly noticed me standing in the doorway with my coffee, she immediately switched To awkward English. Okay. Um, talk to you later about the, uh, homework assignment.

Annabelle stood in my doorway while I was practicing my build orders for Starcraft and pulled the plug from my computer. This. She waved at my setup. All of this. You need to quit gaming. I laughed, thinking she was joking. She wasn't. Adult men don't play video games, Jake. And you have a girlfriend now. You should be taking me out to dinners and spending money on traveling instead. I disagreed, but I couldn't argue either. I was crazy about her. She was beautiful, funny, and up until this moment, I thought she was perfect. I pulled her into my lap and smiled. I have a tournament coming up that I've been training for. After that, I'm all yours. I leaned in to give a kiss, but he dodged it, rolling her eyes. I don't care if it's a million dollars. It's pathetic, she said in a cold voice. If you loved me, you'd stop playing. I stared at her, dumbfounded. You're not serious, I said. Delete everything or I'm done. You have 24 hours, and trust me, you don't wanna choose. Wrong. She threatened and walked out. I'll compromise, I told her over dinner at the expensive sushi place she loved. 10 to midnight, only two hours after the tournament. In three weeks, we can talk about me quitting completely. She stabbed at her salmon roll. Two hours every night is 14 Hours a week? You're ignoring me? Babe, I said gently. You're literally just scrolling on your phone during that time. Look, I'll take you anywhere you want. More dinners like this, weekend trips, whatever you want. Just give me two hours to practice. Her eyes lit up at my offer. Fine. But I'm keeping track. And if you play one minute past midnight, we're done for about a week. She seemed satisfied.

My sister Amy has been making snide comments about my marriage for years now. Every single time she sees me doing something nice for my wife Sadie, she gets this bitter look on her face like I personally ruined her entire day and stomped on her dreams. Last month at Mom's house during our weekly Sunday dinner, I got up to refill Sadie's coffee cup because she was tired from pulling double shifts at the hospital. Amy practically snorted and made this disgusted face. Really? She can't walk to the kitchen herself? Her legs work just fine. Two weeks ago I casually mentioned buying Sadie flowers for absolutely no reason other than I saw them and thought she'd like them. Amy rolled her eyes so hard I genuinely thought they'd get permanently stuck back there. Must be nice to have a husband who wastes money on dead plants that'll be gone in three days. But yesterday was the absolute final straw that broke my patience completely. We were at Sunday dinner again and Sadie mentioned her back was really bothering her from all those 12 hour nursing shift she's been pulling. Without even thinking about it, I started gently massaging her shoulders. Right there at the our table, Amy slammed her fork down so hard it made everyone jump. Oh my god. Seriously? Why do you always do all that? She has hands, doesn't she? She's a perfectly capable grown woman who can take care of herself. The whole table went completely silent. Sadie looked absolutely embarrassed and uncomfortable. Mom cleared her throat awkwardly. Dad just stared at his plate. But Amy wasn't even close to being done with her little tantrum. She leaned forward across the table with this nasty

Sunday evening I got home, Serena was on the couch, arms crossed. Fun weekend? Yeah. Hike, soccer, pizza. You couldn't text me back? Once I saw the texts, didn't have anything new to say. Normal boyfriends check in. Normal girlfriends don't schedule brunches on top of three week old plans. Do you even care if this relationship works? I care enough to want basic planning. No more last minute ultimatums. You make it sound like I'm controlling you. I shrugged. You tried to. I meant it. When I said the doors open, her mouth fell open like she didn't expect me to repeat it for weeks. Serena tried every angle. She'd show me texts from other guys. Brad says I should leave you, so leave. Her friend called. She doesn't mean that stuff about leaving. Then tell her to drop the weekly ultimatum. She tried being sweet. Pancakes, packed lunches, but mentioned soccer plans, and the threats returned. At Thanksgiving dinner with her family, Serena performed her usual speech about how I was distant and selfish. Normal couples spend time together, she told the whole table. Normal couples don't threaten to leave every week. I replied calmly. Her dad set down his fork. If you tell someone you can leave anytime, don't be surprised if they start believing you. Wow. Thanks, Dad. Serena snapped. She stormed out, started packing again. Same weekly performance. Suitcase threats about Brad's place, waiting for me to beg. I Didn't. Maybe I should leave anyway, just to prove a point. What point? That rent's expensive. Finally, she found a studio across town and actually moved out. Tyler moved into the unit next door. Life became simple. Gym, soccer, meal prep. No drama. Two weeks later, late night texts.

The water was rising so fast, it reached my knees within minutes. Suddenly, my brother screamed at the top of his lungs, go upstairs now! Don't move!

Dad covered us up in raincoats and dragged us all the way up into the attic while we waited for the rain to settle down. Hours later, we climbed onto the roof of The house and sat around while firefighters rescued us and our neighbors on boats and helicopters. They later told my parents that if the water had reached the electrical outlets, it could have been fatal. Your son saved you thousands in damages, maybe your lives.

Up to bed at 9 and slept while my parents drank down wine and did whatever it was adults like to do past 9. By 10:30, my brother confirmed that they passed out hard. He hopped onto the computer and booted it up to play with friends, while I went ahead and really slept. But a little past minute, my brother shook me awake. I saw him staring down at me, fear abundant in his eyes, his hands shaking. Do you hear that? He whispered. Yeah, it's raining a lot, I said. But he shook his head and pointed downward. I put my head onto the wooden floor and tried to find the sound, but it was muffled. He grabbed one of Mom's spare flashlights and peeked out from the room. He rushed back inside the room in a panic, his chest heaving up and down. Oh, god! What do we do? Water had begun seeping under our front door, spreading across the entry. My brother ran to the window and fell back. The entire street was flooded, some of the cars already half Buried in muddy water. The storm drain at the corner was completely blocked and water was rising quickly up our porch step. He ran to our parents room and shook dad hard. Dad! Dad, the house is flooding!

This thing jams if you look at it wrong and makes sounds like it's performing an exorcism. Yesterday, I'm elbow deep in toner cartridges when I hear shouting from the break room next door. It's Kaliya Elliott and her husband Brian. Both senior partners here. Married 15 years. Usually the picture of professional composure. You forgot again, didn't you? Kalia's voice cracks. 15 years, Brian. Our anniversary. Brian runs his hands through his hair, looking desperate. Kalia, I didn't forget. I swear I didn't forget. Then where's my card? Where's literally anything that shows you remembered? Everyone in the office is tending to work while obviously eavesdropping. It's like watching a car crash in slow motion. That's when I accidentally knock over my toolbox. Screws scatter everywhere. I'm crawling around collecting them when Brian's voice gets quieter. I did remember, Kaylee. I wrote you something. Something real. But the printer ate it three days ago, and I thought it was gone forever. My brain stops. Three days ago, I'd found something wedge deep in the paper feed mechanism. A crumpled, coffee stained piece of paper with handwritten text that had been completely mangled. I glanced at it and tossed it in the trash, thinking it was someone's rough draft. But what if it Wasn't just notes. What if it was Brian's anniversary letter? I abandoned the printer repair and sprint toward the dumpster behind our building. I dive in head first, digging through coffee grounds, soggy sandwich remains, and what I really hope isn't anyone's.

Dishwasher broke because I loaded it wrong. Her car got a flat because I didn't remind her to check tire pressure. Her sister called her dramatic. Obviously my negative influence rubbing off. The worst part was I started believing some of it. When you hear the same criticisms daily, they echo in your head even when she's not around. Last week, something shifted. Just a quiet realization while sitting in traffic after work. I was dreading going home. I was dreading Walking into my own house. Because whatever mood she was in would become my responsibility to fix. I need a break, she said. Thursday, Cancun with the girls. Next weekend, I. And stressed. Your energy is so negative. While I'm gone, think about what you're bringing to this relationship. Even her vacation was my fault. Sounds good, I said, meaning every word. Just not how she thought. Sunday morning, she stood by the door with her oversized suitcase. Remember what I said? Really think about your mistakes while I'm gone. As I watched her car disappear, I

Dad stood by the fireplace. Jessica lounged with her smirk. Sit down, Lily, Dad commanded. I remained standing. What's this about your wedding? Mom said coldly. We're not paying for the circus anymore. Seventy five thousand dollars for one day? It's excessive, dad said. We agreed on the budget, I said quietly. Jessica looked up. That was before we realized how much you were wasting. Like that four thousand dollar dress, mom interjected. Who needs Crystal centerpieces? Dad crossed his arms. John works at a non profit. No ambition, no real income. Maybe you should reconsider, mom added. You want me to call off my wedding? Find someone who can actually afford the lifestyle you expect, dad said. Jessica snorted. Living in that tiny apartment really screams high expectations. Dad pulled out a folder. I've called the venue, canceled everything. Deposits are forfeited. My stomach dropped. You canceled my wedding venue? Our name was on the contracts, mom said. We had every right. The caterer, to Jessica added. And photographer and florist. Eight months of planning, all gone. I can't believe you did this. Next time, think before planning something beyond your means, dad said. Understood, I said simply. They expected tears. Arguments. Instead, I gave them nothing and left. The drive back was surreal. 23 years old, NBA from Northwestern, secretly running a 2.8 billion dollar hospitality empire. And my parents cancelled my wedding because they thought I couldn't afford it. I built Phoenix Hospitality Group from nothing. I own 17 luxury

I kept thinking about Hudson. How he helped me pass chemistry last year. How he always smiled and said hi even though we weren't friends. How excited he'd been lately, probably because he thought Angela actually liked him. Two days went by, and I watched Hudson at school. He was different, more confident. He actually raised his hand in class. He sat with people at lunch instead of alone. This fake relationship was the best thing that had happened to him, and Daniela was about to weaponize it. I couldn't let it happen. Four days before the party, I did something that would probably end my friendship with Daniella. I made my own anonymous Instagram account. I messaged Hudson, saying I went to Angela's school and needed to warn him. I told him Angela was fake, that someone from his school was catfishing him and planning something horrible for his birthday. Hudson didn't believe me at first. He said I was probably just jealous or trying to mess with him. So I did something I still feel guilty about. I sent him screenshots that Daniella had sent me. Screenshots showing the back end of the fake account with Daniela's email attached. Hudson blocked the Angela account immediately. He didn't come to school for three days. The day of his party arrived. Daniela still showed up with her laptop in her bag, hoping Hudson would show. But Hudson never came to his own birthday party. His mom apologized to everyone. Saying he had food poisoning. Daniela was pissed. Kept checking her phone to see if Hudson had unblocked Angela. That night, Daniela called me, furious. She figured out someone warned Hudson and suspected it was me. She asked if I was the one who ruined her plan. I said yes. She called me a traitor and said I chose some random loser over our five year friendship. I didn't even know who she was in that moment. I told her she was sick in the head, that she nearly drove an innocent kid to suicide because her ego got roused. I said she was a narcissistic psychopath who shouldn't be allowed near other humans. Monday morning, we were both called to the principal's office. Hudson had gone straight to the administration with all the evidence I'd sent him. He had the screenshots showing Daniella's email on the fake account. He had all their conversation.

The medical checkup started immediately. Blood tests every month, full physiques, detailed scans. They said it was normal for foster kids, but something felt off. Mrs. Smith would watch me eat like she was monitoring my nutrition. Any injury sent them into panic mode. Banning basketball when I scraped my knee, taking my bike when I bruised my arm. We have to keep you in perfect condition, she'd say, like I was some kind of investment. By 17, I'd noticed other things. Mister Smith's locked office drawers, missus Smith's red ink, medical appointments in her planner. Their daughter Lauren asking weird questions about my health and energy levels. On my 18th birthday, they finally revealed their plan. Lauren's kidneys are failing, Mister Smith said, sliding medical files across the dinner table. You're a perfect match. We've been preparing for this moment. The folder contained 3 years of my blood work, compatibility charts, genetic testing, everything needed for organ transplantation. But that wasn't the worst part. We've invested so much in you, Mister Smith continued, straightening his expensive tie. The private school alone cost us 40,000. The guitar lessons, the medical Care the clothes. It's time you gave something back to this family. That's when I remembered the locked filing cabinet in the attic.

Daniela got rejected by Hudson three weeks ago. He's this quiet kid in our chemistry class who mostly keeps to himself. Daniela has been obsessed with him since September. She finally asked him to Winter Formal, and he politely said no. He wasn't mean about it. He just said he wasn't interested in dating right now. Daniela completely lost it. She's 17 like me, but she acted like a psycho ex girlfriend from a Netflix show. She came to my house that night sobbing and saying Hudson humiliated her. I tried to tell her it wasn't that deep, but she wasn't hearing it. She kept saying he thought he was better than her, that he needed to be taught a lesson. A week later, Daniella showed me something on her phone that disgusted me. She'd created a whole fake Instagram I'm account. Some gorgeous girl named Angela from our neighbouring school. She'd been messaging Hudson as this fake girl for five days already. Hudson had completely fallen for it. This kid who barely talks to anyone at school, was pouring his heart out to Angela. He told her about his anxiety, how his dad left when he was 12, how he felt invisible at school and wondered if anyone would ever actually want him. He sent her his artwork that nobody knew. He did these beautiful charcoal drawings of birds and landscapes. He even sent Her poems he wrote about being lonely. Daniela was screenshotting everything. She had hundreds of screenshots saved in a folder on her phone labeled Hudson's funeral. When I saw that folder name, I felt sick. I asked Daniela what she was planning. She got this creepy smile and told me the plan. Hudson's eighteenth birthday was next Friday. His mom had rented out the bowling alley and invited our whole chemistry class. She was trying to help him make friends since he struggled socially. Daniela was going to connect her laptop to the TV screens at the bowling alley. She was going to display all of Hudson's messages for ever. Everyone to see everything. His poems about wanting to disappear. His message about being scared he'd die a virgin. A voice note where he talked about his depression and medication. Photos of his artwork with deeply.

Then I started noticing other weird things. James's new girlfriend, Melissa, had been spending more time at his house. She drove this pristine white BMW and always parked in the garage. Now, instead of the driveway where Rex used to greet visitors. Yesterday morning, everything changed. I'm out in my garden at my usual 6 a m. Ritual when I hear it. Faint barking coming from James's house. Not from the yard where Rex used to bark, but from somewhere inside. Basement, maybe. The barking pattern was identical to Rex's old routine. Same duration, same intensity, same territorial aggression. But it was muffled, like it was coming from underground. That's when the animal control officer knocked on my door. Her name was Samantha, and she looked serious. We received an anonymous tip about your neighbor, James. Someone reported possible animal cruelty. Did you notice anything unusual about his dog, Rex? I told her everything about Rex's two year barking routine. How it suddenly stopped when James claimed he ran away, and most importantly, how I've been hearing the same barking pattern from inside his house every morning. Samantha's eyes lit up. Can you show me exactly where you hear the barking? And would you be willing to document the timing? We walked to my tomato plants right against the fence. At exactly 602:00am, we heard it again. Rex's unmistakable bark coming from James's basement window. Samantha immediately called for backup. This is exactly what we needed, she explained. We suspected James

I see this sign that says green something and think, close enough. I walk into this sleek lobby, tell the receptionist I'm here for the 10:00am presentation, and she points me toward Conference Room B. I'm lugging my laptop, a stack of printed slides as backup, and this prototype phone I've been using for demos. I walk into this room full of people in uniforms, which seemed weird for a restaurant chain, but maybe they were managers or something. There's this serious looking woman at the head of the table, a bunch of guys with radios clipped to their belts. Everyone's got these thick binders in front of them. I set up my laptop and just dive in. I'm showing them screenshots of my app, explaining how the GPS tracking works, how drivers can update delivery status in real time, how customers get live updates on their orders. They're asking all these technical questions about response times, coverage areas, our efficiency. One guy, Goes what's your average time from dispatch to destination? Another woman asks, how do you handle priority calls? I'm thinking, wow, these restaurant people are way more sophisticated than I expected. They really care about getting food delivered fast. I show them my heat map feature that shows where demand is highest. My algorithm that assigns the

So I put a stop to our fake marriage. We've been married for five years, and I thought I was being the perfect husband. I spent three hours cooking her favorite meal for our anniversary, set up candles, even dug out that playlist from our first date. When she walked through the door with her sister and best friend, she took one look at the setup, rolled her eyes, and said, loud enough for everyone to hear, stop trying to be romantic, it's pathetic. You desperate? Then she turned to her friends. This is exactly what I was telling you about. He does this needy stuff constantly. The room went dead silent. Her sister looked uncomfortable. Her best friend stared at the floor. I stood there holding wine, watching my wife destroy our marriage with one sentence. I set the wine down, looked her straight in the eye, and said, you know what? You're absolutely right. She expected me to apologize, to scramble. Instead, I started blowing out the candles. What are you doing? She asked, losing that confident edge. Stopping, I replied. Gathering the flowers. Romance is pathetic when it's one sided. So I'm done being pathetic, tossed the flowers in the trash, and ordered pizza. We can eat like roommates from now on. Pepperoni or cheese? That night, she tried damage control, talking about bad days, overreacting. But something had shifted in me. I heard you perfectly. I Told her, message received. No more romantic gestures, no more pathetic behavior. She laughed it off. Maybe we both need to be more realistic about what marriage actually is. Those words would haunt her the next morning. I didn't bring her coffee in bed like I had every weekend for five years. When she came downstairs expecting in her usual cup, I was finishing mine. Coffee is in the kitchen, I said without looking up. I saw our marriage clearly for the first time. I was the one planning date nights she'd complain about. I was the one.

The kid can roast me in Mario Kart and crack one liners that make my mom choke on her coffee. This year, all he wanted for his birthday was to go to the big shopping mall downtown. The one with the massive food court, arcade, and the store that sells those custom sneakers he's obsessed with. We've been planning it for weeks, saved up to buy him a pair. Mom took the day off work. Even the weather seemed like it was cooperating. We got there around noon, Ethan in his wheelchair with a brand new Marvel hoodie, beaming like it was Christmas morning. He spotted a balloon stand near the entrance, and the vendor tied one to the armrest of his chair. It floated above him like a little red exclamation Mark. We spent the first hour just browsing, Ethan pointing out things he wanted to totally buy when he's rich, me joking that he'd better remember his big brother when that happened. Eventually, we headed to the sneaker store. Ethan had been talking about this moment for months. He rolled right up to the display, ran his hand over the shoes, and looked at me like, is this real life? That's When it happened, out of nowhere, this guy in a mall manager badge strides over. Tall, late 40s, perfect hair, gel helmet. He stops a few feet from us and says loudly, sir, you can't just roll in here and block the displays. I thought he was joking. Ethan was completely in the clear, nowhere near blocking anyone. I said, he's just looking at the shoes.

They ordered three large pizzas. One pepperoni, one veggie, one pineapple, because apparently someone in HR hates. Now, there's an unspoken law when it comes to communal food. If you're not in the room when it arrives, your slice becomes part of The Hunger Games. That's not rudeness. That's survival. That's etiquette. That's biology.

When I realised he was serious, I told him absolutely not. He had months to figure this out and deliberately picked the worst possible date. He could reschedule or find someone else to help him. I fought for days. He kept saying I was being selfish and that a good wife would stay Home. I reminded him that he had multiple other options and chose this one, knowing I'd be gone. His mom could come help, or he could wait until October. Finally, his mom agreed to come stay with him, which should have been the end of it, but the guilt trips kept coming.

Instead of saying chicken nuggets or whatever, Tyler suddenly screams at the top of his lungs, help me! My babysitter stole this car! The worker at the window just froze. Like, completely stopped moving. I could see her eyes get huge and she started looking around frantically. Cars behind me started honking because we weren't moving forward. I tried to laugh it off and explain, but Tyler wasn't done. He doubled down and yelled Even louder. She also stole my house. Call the police now! The worker was backing away from the window and talking into her headset. I could hear her saying something about a possible kidnapping situation. My heart was beating so fast, I thought I might pass out. Within maybe three minutes, two police cars pulled into the parking lot with their lights flashing. Not the sirens, thankfully, but still. I'm sitting there in the drive through with a scream.

My dad would pack sandwiches and we'd spend entire days walking around, reading every single plaque, trying all the interactive stuff. The problem was I had this stupid habit of taking things. Not big things, just little stuff from gift shops. A pencil here, a tiny eraser there. Those free pamphlets that said do not remove in tiny letters.

Now my brother Derek thinks he can just sell it and split the money. He's already contacted three realtors. The irony wasn't lost on me. For three years, I've been quietly paying property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. Every time something needed fixing, I'd anonymously arrange for repairs. The new driveway last fall, that was me. The water heater that got warranty replacement. Also me. Derek had been living rent free in a house I owned, while constantly telling everyone how much more successful he was compared to his loser sister. When I walked back inside, he was sketching floor plans on napkins with his wife Sarah. We could expand the master bedroom, he was saying, waving his pen around, and add a deck off the back. Sarah Added practically calculating dollar signs in her head. Dad was nodding along enthusiastically. Oh, and we could finally renovate that outdated bathroom. Mom sat quietly in her chair, looking uncertain but not saying anything. She I always avoided family conflict. My college age niece Emma was on her laptop, probably already browsing apartments with the inheritance money Derek had promised her. Actually, I said calmly, returning to the living room, I need to tell you something important. Derek didn't even look up from his sketching

I introduced her to one who was already married to three other women. Sophie had this gift. She could make any man forget I existed within 10 minutes of meeting him. Sweet, innocent Sophie, with her nursing degree and volunteer work at the animal shelter. Everyone thought she was an angel, but I knew better. Seven boyfriends in five years suddenly realized they had feelings for her instead. She'd cry, claim she never meant for it to happen. That love just finds a way. Our parents always took her side. How could I blame Sophie for being lovable? Then I met Anwar at a medical conference. Gorgeous doctor, drove a Bentley, owned penthouses in three cities. Also happened to be my patient's son visiting from Dubai. We talked for hours about travel, medicine, life goals. That's when I Learned his secret. Anwar wasn't just married. He was married to three women across different countries, all legal in their jurisdictions, all unaware of each other. A wife in Dubai, one in Morocco, one in Pakistan. He was shopping for number four. Someone naive, desperate for luxury, willing to relocate without asking questions. I provide everything, he bragged, showing me photos of his homes. They live like Queens. They just can't be too curious about my travel schedule. I smiled. Already planning. You know, my sister would be perfect for you. Introduce them at our family dinner. Told Sophie privately that Anwar was completely Off limits. That I was crazy about him. That I'd never forgive her if she tried anything. Watched her eyes light up with that familiar predatory gleam. Within two weeks, Sophie was bragging about her new boyfriend. Successful doctor who flew her to Paris for their third date. Who bought her a Cartier bracelet just because. Who said she was unlike any woman he'd ever met. I'm sorry, she said, not looking sorry at all. We just connected. You understand, right? You can't control chemistry. Our mother gushed about what

Pete hat diese Familie geliebt. doch dann reichte Mir der Anwalt einen weiteren Umschlag. dieser ist speziell f√ºr dich als testamentsvollstrecker. darin befand sich 1 handgeschriebener Brief von Pete. fragst dich jetzt wahrscheinlich, warum ich alles Leuten vermacht habe, die du nicht kennst. das sind keine zuf√§lligen fremden. kleiner Jake Morrison ist der Junge, der meinen Rasen kostenlos gem√§ht hat, als seine Mutter es sich nicht leisten konnte. Maria Santos hat jede Woche Mein Haus geputzt und ist immer geblieben, um mit Mir zu plaudern, wenn ich einsam war. David Kim hat mich zu jedem Arzttermin gefahren, als ich zu stolz war, meine Familie um Hilfe zu bitten. der Brief ging weiter und erkl√§rte jede Person. Becker Williams war seine Nachbarin, die ihm Suppe brachte, wenn er krank war und nie etwas daf√ºr verlangte. Anthony Hayes war 1 junger Mechaniker, der Pete's Auto nur gegen ersatzteilkosten reparierte, weil er wusste, dass Pete 1 festes Einkommen hatte. diese Leute waren freundlich zu Mir, ohne etwas daf√ºr zu erwarten, schrieb Pete. sie behandelten mich wie 1 Familienmitglied, als meine eigentliche Familie zu besch√§ftigt war, um anzurufen. ich hoffe, das lehrt dich etwas dar√ºber, was wirklich z√§hlt. du bist Anders als die. anderen. deshalb liest du diesen Brief. k√ºmmere dich um diese guten Menschen. unter dem Brief stand 1 PS schau im Bankschlie√üfach nach. der Schl√ºssel h√§ngt unter der K√ºchenschublade. ich ging an diesem Nachmittag zu Pete, w√§hrend alle anderen noch mit dem Anwalt stritten. tats√§chlich war 1 Schl√ºssel genau dort festgeklebt, wo er es angegeben hatte. in der Bank enthielt das Schlie√üfach 50.000 Dollar in Bar. und eine weitere Notiz f√ºr meinen lieblingsneffen, der mich nie um etwas gebeten hat, benutze das Geld, um etwas zu tun, dass dich gl√ºcklich macht, nicht etwas, worauf deine Eltern stolz sind. ich habe meiner Familie nie von dem Geld erz√§hlt. sie sind immer noch verbittert √ºber das Testament und sagen, Pete habe am Ende den Verstand verloren. aber jetzt verstehe ich es. wie verbrachte seine letzten Jahre umgeben von Menschen, die sich wirklich um ihn sorgten, nicht von Menschen, die nur seine DNA teilten. einen Teil des Geldes habe ich verwendet, um Jake Morrison beim bezahlen seines Community Colleges zu helfen. den Rest spare ich f√ºr etwas, das Pete gut hei√üen w√ºrde.

You should be grateful. So I smiled and said, then let them try. I've been with Maya for three years. She was beautiful, sharp and funny. But her confidence had become suffocating, arrogant. My role was simply to be grateful for her presence while absorbing constant digs about my subordinate status. The end came. On a Thursday, she was admiring her reflection before dinner. You're so complacent, Mark. You're lucky to have me. Other guys would kill to have me. You should be grateful. For years I'd absorbed comments like that. But this time, something inside me didn't break. It clarified. The constant anxiety was just gone. I met her gaze in the mirror and smiled. Then let them try. Her smile faltered. What's that supposed to mean? We're done, Maya. The confusion curdled into rage. You're breaking up with me because you're insecure? No. I'm just not interested in being grateful anymore. The yelling started. I was pathetic, throwing away the best thing in my life. I'd come crawling back. I didn't engage. I just packed. As I left, she fired her parting shot. Don't forget Liam's engagement party Saturday. It's going to be embarrassing when you show up alone. Everyone will know I'll be there, Maya. Don't worry about me. What she didn't know was that the lease was solely in my name. More importantly, I had Isabella, a witty graphic designer I'd met on a work project. Had been a spark, and she'd mentioned being single. I texted her a Hail Mary invitation to be my plus one. Her response was perfect. A little awkward is my specialty. Consider me your social Kevlar. Saturday. I picked up Isabella. She looked effortlessly stunning in a navy dress. The drive was full of laughter. No mind games, no tension at the party. Maya was holding court by the fire pit, crafting her victim narrative. She hadn't seen us yet. Isabella leaned in. Target acquired. She's perfected the brave little soldier look. We took the long way around talking to couples. Isabella was natural and engaging. People were instantly charmed. Soon I felt Maya's stare. Her story died on her lips. Pathetic ex wasn't behaving as scripted. She walked toward us with a predator's saunter Mark. Maya said, artificial sweetness dripping. Her eyes dismissed Isabella. And you brought a friend. This is Isabella. Isabella offered a genuine smile. So nice to meet you, Maya. Maya's smile was all teeth. Moving on so quickly seems death.

So we had just graduated high school, and me, Tyler, and my three buddies wanted to do something crazy before we all split up for college. Tyler suggested we sneak into the community pool after hours. Just one last adventure, he said. The pool closed at 9, but we waited until, like, 11:30 to make sure nobody was around. The fence wasn't even that high, maybe six feet. We all hopped over easy, laughing about how we were such rebels now. The water looked perfect under the moon, all still and glassy. We stripped down to our boxers and jumped in. The water was warmer than I expected, probably because it had been hot all day. We were splashing around being idiots when Tyler dared us to swim to the deep end and touch the bottom. Simple enough, right? I was always the best swimmer in our group, so I went first, swimming down toward the 12 foot Mark when something caught my eye. At first I thought it was just a towel or maybe a pool toy someone forgot. Dark blue or black, just floating there near the drain. But when I got closer, my blood went cold. It was a wallet. Leather. Waterlogged. Definitely belonged to someone. I grabbed it and shot back up to the surface, gasping. Guys! I called out, but my voice cracked. There's something down there! Tyler swam over, asking what I found. I showed him the wallet, and his face went white. We all dove down together, this time using our phone flashlights in waterproof cases. That's when we saw him. A man, maybe 40 or 50

The first red flag was the locked cabinet. I was the lowest level engineer at Argonic Tech, a midsized R&D firm known more for flashy demos than real world products. Fresh out of college, I had no office, no budget and no respect. Just a Tiny Desk near the vending machine and an assigned mentor named Brian. Brian was fine. Middle aged, corporate, polished and always five minutes late to meetings with a coffee in hand. And a story about his golfing weekend didn't take much interest in me until I started working on the Dynamic Stabilizer project. The stabilizer was my thesis. A compact mechanical unit designed to counterbalance motion in drones, making them more responsive in wind heavy environments. My university had laughed at the idea, argonics didn't. They immediately assigned me to a research fellowship. With a 36 thousand dollar salary and all the bottom shelf instant coffee I could drink, I built the prototype in the corner of the testing lab. Over 6 months, Brian mostly left me alone, except for occasional check ins where he asked me to dump it down for the monthly reports. I didn't mind. I liked working solo. Until one morning I came in early and noticed something odd. The stabilizer was missing. My name was still on the schedule. My desk was untouched, but the prototype. Gone. So was the tiny journal I kept next to it. I Asked Brian if he'd seen it. He frowned and said, I must have misplaced it. That afternoon, I saw the cabinet in his office, the one he always kept locked. It had a new label printed across the front stabilizer. IP Secure. Do not touch. I didn't sleep that night. The next morning, I logged into the company's internal patent filing system. Brian's name was listed as the inventor. Not a mention of mine. I felt physically sick. I went to HR. They said Brian had filed it through the proper invention disclosure process. And I wasn't listed as a co author because my contract stated all work produced at argonics became argonics property. I pushed harder. I showed.

When I signed up for the 10 day wilderness trek through the Rockies, I wasn't trying to impress anyone. I wasn't chasing adventure or doing it for the pictures or hoping to find myself on a Mountain Top. I just needed silence, reset, something to shake the fog loose. Day one, I stayed quiet, hiked at my own pace, ate my dinner by the edge of camp, headphones in. I wasn't there to bond. That's probably why Travis noticed me. He wasn't a guide, just one of those guys who talks like he owns the place. Big voice, bigger opinions. He showed up in designer gear like we were hiking a red carpet. Kept barking trail safety tips he'd clearly pulled from Reddit. Called himself the unofficial team lead. First night, while I was setting up my tent, he walked by and laughed. Hey, you okay, quiet guy? You look like you're about to pass out just standing there. I said I was fine. He smirked. You sure you've got that indoor kid trying to do nature energy? Hope we don't have to carry you halfway. I could have ignored it. Should have. But it hit a nerve. I'd spent the last year learning how to manage panic attacks without falling apart in public. The outdoors helped. The routine helped. But Travis? Guys like him were the reason it took me so long to get help in The first place. By day three, I was pacing myself on a steep incline, focused on my breathing. Not panicking, just trying not to. That's when he yelled down the slope loud enough for the whole group to hear, uh oh! Somebody call a therapist. Panic attack incoming. Some people laughed. I don't blame them. Peer pressures. A hell of a thing. But I saw the guide frown, and I saw one of the women, Rachel, give me this quiet, apologetic look. That night, I sat by the fire with my hood up, staring into the flames. Not angry, not sad. Just done. I almost left the next morning. Almost. But I didn't. I told myself I was finishing this for me. Day five.

My dress is attention seeking. I was so excited trying on wedding dresses with my girls last month. After three different shops, I finally found the one at this boutique downtown. It was this gorgeous off shoulder dress with lace sleeves and beading that caught the light perfectly. When I put it on, my best friend Nicole literally started crying. I felt like a princess for the first time in my life. The shop had this cute thing where they I make you a little memory book with your dress photos and some special texts from your fiance. I thought it would be sweet to include some of the messages Ben had sent me about being excited for our wedding day. The shop assistant asked for my phone to help pick out the best ones. I handed it over and went back to looking at myself in the mirror. That's when I heard the assistant gasp behind me. She looked pale and kept staring at my phone. When I asked what was wrong, she just said there might be a mix up with the screenshots. Turns out she accidentally opened Ben's group chat with his buddies instead of our private messages, and what she saw made her stomach drop. She quietly called over the manager and showed her too, and they both looked at me like I was about to get hit by a truck. The manager pulled me aside, And said they didn't feel comfortable making the memory book anymore. When I asked why, she hesitated, then showed me my phone. The group chat was called Wedding Planning Hell, and Ben had been sending photos of me in different dresses all week. Under the photo of my dream dress, he wrote, she picked the most attention seeking dress possible. It's like she wants everyone staring at her chest instead of her face. His friend Tyler replied, dude, why didn't you just tell her to pick something normal? Ben's response was, because then she'll cry and I'll have to deal with that drama.

I was on jury duty for an armed robbery case that seemed pretty straightforward at first. Three masked men hit a quick stop gas station at 2:00am. Made off with about $800 and a bunch of cigarettes. One guy got caught fleeing the scene. Demari Moran, 23, who swore up and down he was completely innocent. The case had been dragging on for three days. Demari seemed like a decent kid, actually. Clean record. Worked at a warehouse, lived with his mom. His story was simple. He was at his girlfriend's apartment that entire night, never left. Couldn't have possibly been involved. The prosecution's case had some holes. This security footage was grainy, the witness descriptions were inconsistent. And most importantly, the getaway driver was clearly shown to have a distinctive scar running down his left hand. Demari? Not a Mark on him. Day four, they called Demari's girlfriend, destiny, to testify. She's maybe 20, nervous as hell, wearing her best dress. Takes the stand, raises her right hand, swears to tell the truth. His lawyer walks her through the timeline. Yes, Mari came over around 8 p m. That night. Yes, he stayed until morning. No, he never left the apartment, not even for a cigarette break. The prosecutor gets up for cross examination. Standard questions at first. How long they've been dating? How she could be so sure about the timing? Ma'am, I wanna be absolutely clear. You're testifying under Oath that Mister Moran was with you from 8 p m. Until 6 a m. The following morning? Yes, sir. Absolutely. How can you be so certain of these specific times? Destiny straightens up, proud to help her boyfriend. Because we had this whole night planned. We ordered Chinese food. I still have the receipt on my phone.

I used to sneak into my college cafeteria at 2:00am to steal leftover pizza. One night I walk in expecting it to be empty and there's this cop sitting at a table drinking coffee and eating a donut like it's totally normal. Officer Jenkins just looks at me and goes, you're either really brave or really stupid. I freeze like a deer in headlights thinking I'm about to get arrested. But then he stands up and says, let's see how good you really are at this. I'm confused until he points to the kitchen and goes, you think you can sneak past me to get that pizza? Let's find out. This guy just turned my midnight snack run into some kind of weird game. He starts counting to 10 and tells me to run. I'm sprinting through the cafeteria like I'm in a spy movie, diving behind soda machines and crawling under tables. Jenkins is walking around pretending to look for me, but he's being super dramatic about it. He's checking the freezer going, hmm, where could she be, while I'm literally hiding behind a trash can three feet away. After like 10 minutes of this, he finds me crouched behind the salad bar. Instead of being mad, he starts laughing and slides a leftover donut across the counter. Not bad, kid, but you knocked over a chair. Work on your stealth. I thought that was the end of it. Wrong. Two weeks later, I find a sticky note on my dorm door that says, next time, bring a friend, OJ this man really just challenged me to up my game. So I convinced my roommate, Lisa, to come with me the next time. We show up at 2:00am and Jenkins is there again like he's been waiting. Ah, you brought back up. This calls for Level 2. He pulls out these fake handcuffs made from cafeteria straws and starts chasing us around the dining hall. Lisa is screaming and I'm dying laughing while we're running between tables. He arrests both of us and makes us sit in the corner for five minutes before letting us go with leftover cookies. This became a weekly thing. Jenkins would leave me notes with increasingly ridiculous challenges. Can you steal a banana without touching the floor?

What do you mean by that? I stared at my Uber driver, Carlos. We just pulled up to my apartment complex after a long day at work. But instead of ending the ride, he was studying my building with genuine concern. Ma'am, I've driving for five years and something's not right here, he said quietly. There's a black sedan that's been following us for the past 20 minutes. Same car, keeping exactly three cars behind us the whole drive. He just pulled into your parking lot right after we did. I turn to look out the back window and my blood ran cold. There was indeed a black car parked under the street light near the entrance with someone still sitting inside watching our vehicle. Carlos continued while keeping his voice low. I first noticed him when we left your office building. I thought it was coincidence, but he followed us through eight different turns, including that detour when I missed the highway exit. Nobody takes that exact route by accident. When I tested him by slowing down, he slowed down. When I sped up, he matched my speed perfectly. My heart started pounding as Carlos pulled out his phone and showed me photos he'd taken at red lights. The license plate was clearly visible and the driver was definitely focused on our car rather than the road. This is going to Sound paranoid, but I think you should call someone before getting out, Carlos said urgently. I've seen this behavior before and people who follow others this systematically aren't planning anything good. The way he's been tracking us suggest he knows your routine and where you live. I tried to think of anyone who might follow me, but I lived quietly with no drama or enemies. Then I remembered recent things that hadn't seemed significant again, the feeling of being watched. The same dark car in my mirrors. My neighbor mentioning someone asking about my schedule. Carlos was scrolling through his driver history when his expression changed to confusion. Ma'am, this is strange. I've had three other ride requests to pick you up from your work address in the past two weeks. But when I arrived, you weren't there. Someone kept calling in rides under your name and then no showing. The realization hit me like ice water.

I'm the 1% of kids who never cheated in a school where everyone else did. By the time I got to high school, cheating wasn't just common. It was basically part of the curriculum. Teachers would leave answer keys on their desks and pretend not to notice when kids snapped pictures. Parents would text their kids the answers during tests after bribing administrators for advanced copies. My freshman year, I watched a girl literally Google translate her entire Spanish essay during class while the teacher graded papers three feet away. Nobody cared. The kid next to me in math class had formulas written on his water bottle in tiny print. Even the so called honor students were trading answer keys through group chats. But my parents had drilled something into me since I was little. Knowledge mattered more than grades. They'd rather see me fail honestly than succeed by cheating. So while everyone else was finding shortcuts, I was actually studying. When I got to junior year, AP chemistry, things got insane. Class was known for being impossible without help. Kids would sneak formulas written on the inside of their calculator covers or trade answer sheets in the bathroom between periods. There was even a whole network where parents paid thousands to get their kids leaked test questions days in advance. My lab partner, Emma, kept asking if I wanted to join their group chat where they shared answers. He couldn't understand why I Kept saying, no, everyone does it, she'd whisper during tests. The teacher expects it. But I kept my head down and worked through the problems myself. One Tuesday morning, everything changed. We were taking our midterm when the principal walked in with two

I'm not perfect or good enough. Every time I think about why people leave, it makes perfect sense. I mean, who would want to stay with someone like me? I don't even like myself most of the time. There's this constant feeling of inadequacy, like I'm always falling short no matter how hard I try. It's exhausting and it hurts to admit that maybe I'm the reason why people decide to walk away. I can't shake the feeling that if I were better, if I were somehow different, things would be different. But I'm not, and they aren't. I wish I could see myself through the eyes of someone who truly cares, someone who sees the good in me that I struggle to find. But instead, I'm stuck in this cycle of self doubt and self hate, always questioning my worth. It's a lonely place to be, and I get why people don't stick around. If I could, I'd probably leave myself, too. But here I am trying to figure out how to live with the person I've become, even when I hate who I see. Wakati Huo.

I see the green dot, I see the whole friend list active. Don't lie to me and say it's nothing. You just stop choosing me. And what hurts more is feeling like I'm just a backup now. I'm being kept around just in case the new group drops you or switches up. Like I'm the in case of emergency friend. I'm not a fostering safety net. You used to need me. Now I'm just convenient when you're bored. And I see it, I feel it and it sucks. But you know what? I'm done begging for space in your life. I'm done waiting for a text back just to see you on Facetime with the new crew. I'm done being loyal to someone who already left me without saying a word. So yeah, it hurts. It hurts like hell.

There's no hate about being plus size. In fact, I think everybody is beautiful no matter what. some of these self centered influencers don't seem to think the same. If you know, you have a plus size body, which is perfectly fine if you're healthy, you cannot go into a store like Brandy Melville, which is a store specifically made for petite sizes and teenagers, especially since they only have one size and expect their clothes to fit you. And then you go online to tell the whole world to hate on Brandy Melvo because their petite sizes couldn't fit you. And I think y'all know who I'm talking about. News flash, there's different body types besides plus size that need to have accommodations to their clothes to fit them. Brandy Melville is one of the stores that provide accommodations for petite sizes. It's the same thing as a skinny woman going into a store specifically made for plus size people like Taylor or Lane Bryant and complaining on the internet that the clothes are too baggy on them. Like what did you expect? Not everything is going to accommodate to you whether your ego believes it or not. So no, if you are not petite or close to that body type, you are most likely not going to be able to fit into petite size clothes, which is actually pretty Obvious. Oh, boy, you really solved the case this time, didn't ya, Sherlock? Maybe next time Enola will guide us towards the common sense. That's not even the bad part. The bad part is that the bickering has actually worked. There has been a noticeable increase of Brandy Melville's one size clothes are too big on the ones who actually need them to be small. And notice how I'm only talking about Brandy Melville. That's because it's the only store that actually has trendy in style, affordable and cute clothing for petite women. The unreasonable hate is taking that away from girlies who actually need it. We need inclusivity. All bodies are beautiful until it's skinny women anyways. Who's a spray 6, 9 O U t.

When I was 17, I worked summers at my aunt's restaurant, cash only, no questions asked. The job was simple, bus tables, wash dishes, stay invisible. Perfect for a shy kid who spoke three languages but pretended to understand only English. My parents immigrated from Poland when I was 8. At school, I Learned English fast, but nobody knew I'd been teaching myself Spanish for two years, listening to telenovelas while doing homework. The restaurant attracted all types. I Learned to blend into the background. Customers would talk like I wasn't there or like I couldn't understand them. That's how I discovered what Mister Rodriguez really thought of me. He came in every Tuesday for lunch meetings, mid 50s, expensive suits, generous tips. He'd smile, call me kiddo, ask about school in careful English. I thought he was being kind. One Tuesday, he arrived with his nephew visiting from Mexico. They sat at table 7 and started talking in rapid Spanish. I was clearing the next table when I heard my name. The Polish girl cleans up well, his nephew said. You could probably get her for cheap. I froze, cloth in hand. Oh, I've been working on that, Mister Rodriguez replied. She's young, desperate for money. Her family is probably illegal anyway. My stomach dropped. What are you thinking? The nephew asked. Just some private cleaning work at my house. Start her off washing dishes. See how Grateful she gets. They both laughed. Be careful, the nephew warned. These Eastern European girls can be trouble. This one's not smart, he said confidently. She barely speaks English, follows orders without questions. Perfect. Just wait until she turns 18 next month, he continued. Then I'll make my move. Her aunt won't be able to protect her from immigration if I make the right calls. The nephew raised his beer. Easy targets. I wanted to run, to scream, to throw their food in their faces. Instead, I walked to the kitchen and started planning. The next Tuesday, he came in alone. I served his coffee with my usual shy smile. How's school going, kiddo, he asked. Good, I said quietly. You know, I might have some work for you soon. Private job, good money. He reached over and touched my hand. You're a good girl, I can tell. I nodded and walked away. That weekend, I called my cousin Tomash, 6 feet tall, built like a linebacker, studying criminal justice. I explained everything in Polish. His face went dark. What do you need me to do? He asked. The following Tuesday, Comash sat at the bar wearing his college football jacket. Mister Rodriguez arrived right on time. I approached his table carrying coffee and my phone. Here's your coffee, Mister Rodriguez, I said. Clearly, he looked up.

Uncle Wayne was worth millions, but lived like a miser, constantly testing our family to see who was worthy of his money. Every holiday was an audition where cousins would compete for his approval like desperate contestants on a reality show. I'm leaving everything to whoever proves they don't need it, he'd announce at family dinners while everyone kissed his ass and hung on his every word. My cousins would bring him expensive gifts they couldn't afford, offer to clean his house for free, practically beg for his attention and validation. They'd research his interests and pretend to share his hobbies. My cousin Kyle even switched his major to business because Uncle Wayne mentioned he respected entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, I brought nothing and sat in the corner reading a book, completely disinterested in his little power games. He doesn't seem to care about family, he'd say loud enough for me to hear. Testing to see if I'd scramble for his approval like the others. You're right, I'd reply without looking up from my book. I don't care about your money, either. This always made him pause. While my cousins were falling over themselves to prove their worth, I was actively proving my indifference. While they fought over who could drive him to appointments and grocery shop for him, I got a second job. And started saving every penny. While they argued about his will, I was building my own future. When they'd ask why I never visited Uncle Wayne, I'd say, he has plenty of volunteers. I found his manipulation disgusting. Watching grown adults to base themselves for money made me sick. I'd rather be broke with dignity than rich through desperation. My cousins thought I was crazy. Don't you want financial security? Anna would ask. I'm setting myself up without begging, I'd tell her. While they spent their weekends doing his yard work and running his errands, I was working overtime and taking online courses to improve my skills. While they were buying him birthday presents and Christmas gifts, I was investing in my education and building an emergency fund. The dynamic was fascinating to watch. The more desperate they became for his approval, the more he seemed to enjoy withholding it. The more I ignored him, the more curious he became about me. At family gatherings, he'd try to bait me into conversations about money and success. I'd give polite, brief responses and go back to whatever I was doing. I wasn't rude, but I wasn't performing for him either. Grace, what are your career plans? He'd ask in front of everyone. Working on it. I'd say simply not elaborating. This drove him crazy because he couldn't figure out my angle. Everyone else was transparent in their attempts to impress him, but I genuinely didn't seem to care about his opinion. Or his money.

And she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. At the cemetery, she literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would Mention how hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I now, now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce pregnant lady coming through or baby on board needs to pee. There were like 30 people there grieving. And she's treating it like her personal pregnancy announcement party. But then she crossed the line. Rachel was sitting.

Everywhere I went in Cleveland, people swore they knew me. Hey, don't you work at the grocery store on 55th? Weren't you at my cousin's wedding? It was funny at first until it wasn't. One morning I was working the register at the hardware store when two cops walked in. I figured they were just grabbing supply until they asked my name. The next thing I knew, they spun me around, cuffed me and started reading me my rights. My co workers froze, customer stared and I just kept saying this has to be a mistake. They dragged me out anyway like I've been caught red handed. At the station, they pulled up the security footage of a gas station robbery from a week earlier. My stomach dropped. The guy on the screen looked exactly like me. Same build, same beard, same haircut, even the same black hoodie I wore all the time. I almost convinced myself it was me. It got worse. Three different eyewitnesses picked me out of a lineup. No hesitation. That's him, 100%. I didn't even have an alibi that night. I've been home gaming, not texting or calling anyone, no receipts, nothing. To the cops, I was their guy. The evidence stacked up so neatly against Me? It felt unreal. My public defender sat me down and gave it to me straight with video, eyewitnesses and no alibi, you're looking at serious time. The da is offering a plea deal, two years if you plead guilty. If you fight it and lose, you could get 10. I thought about it, two years for something I didn't do, 10 years if I lost. My chest felt like it was caving in, but I couldn't do it. I couldn't sign a piece of paper saying I was guilty when I wasn't. So I tried something.

What are you doing in your final days? As a single dad with two kids, my biggest fear wasn't death itself. It was leaving my 8 and 11 year old boys alone after they'd already lost their mom two years ago. Unfortunately, my cancer had spread everywhere and my only shot at survival was an experimental treatment that required being in a medically induced coma for months. Even then, I had maybe a 1% chance of waking up. Everyone had already accepted I wasn't coming back. Funeral planned, headstone selected and my sister in law ready to take care of my children. The night before surgery, I asked my best friend, Logan, to come over for one last beer. We've been brothers since college. He was the godfather to both my children. We talked about old times, laughed about stupid things we've done. Until I asked him for the biggest favor of my life. I told him I needed someone to be there for my boys. Not just handle money or logistics, but really be there. Be the father figure they'd need. He looked me straight in the eyes and gave me his word. Said those boys were his too. Every game, every milestone. Teaching them to shave, to drive, to be good men. He'd be there for all of it. That promise between. This was sacred. That was all I needed to hear. My sister in law had a good heart, but Had never managed money. So I gave Logan $600,000, my entire life savings, to handle everything, pay her monthly, cover the boys expenses, make sure they never went without. I went under, trusting him completely, believing my boys would have everything they needed while I was gone. Six months later, I woke up. The doctors called it a miracle, said the treatment worked better than anyone expected. I was weak, confused, but alive. When I asked about my boys, the nurses said they were fine, that my sister in law had been taking great care of them. But when I finally got home, the truth hit me like a sledgehammer.

It's only been 11 days and the world is completely off its fucking rocker. Charlie Kirk was killed in front of his family. David was found with a body in his car. A Ukrainian girl was stabbed on the subway. And now Elon Musk isn't even the richest man on the planet anymore. Can we chill for one second? First, Charlie Kurt got shot during a speech in Utah. He was literally in front of his wife and kids when a bullet entered his artery through his neck. The scene was so bloody and gruesome, it's insane. A Ukrainian girl gets stabbed on a train in Charlotte. She escaped a literal war, came here to be safe and still got killed because this planet has zero peace. Then D4D has a whole body in his car, like not a metaphorical one, an actual human body in a bag in his trunk. And this dude just casually performed like he didn't have a horror movie in his backseat. What the hell? And even outside all of that, Elon Musk is no longer the richest person in the world, losing his top spot to a rival tech CEO, showing how unstable everything feels right now, even at the highest levels. It's like every time I open my phone, reality speed runs another tragedy. Like, bro, it's been 11 days. September just started. I thought my only problem this month would be math class, but no, apparently it's Full blown world collapse. Society isn't just cooked, it's burnt to ash.

The doctor said she had four months with brain cancer, so when she asked to try cigarettes and wine, I figured, why not? She's 16 and dying. Normal rules don't apply. We spent three weeks bonding on the back porch. She'd smoke these little cigarettes I bought her, and we'd split a beer while talking about everything she'd never get to do. It was beautiful. In this twisted way, she seemed more relaxed than since the diagnosis. Those evenings became sacred to us. She'd tell me about boys she had crushes on but never got to date. We'd talk about college majors she'd researched but would never pursue. She wanted to study marine biology. Said she'd always dreamed of swimming with sharks. The irony wasn't lost on either of us that she was more afraid of living than dying. I watched my wife struggle with what we were doing. She'd see us through the kitchen window and her face would crumble. But she never said anything. How do you argue with a dying kid's last requests? How do you be the parent who says no when time is running out? She started taking longer shifts at work, I think to avoid watching us slowly poisoning ourselves. My daughter started sleeping better. The constant anxiety that had consumed her since the diagnosis seemed to fade with each cigarette. She'd lean against my shoulder, and we'd just sit in comfortable Silence. Watching the sunset. I memorized those moments, knowing I'd replay them forever after she was gone. She told me things during those sessions that broke my heart. How she felt guilty for being sick. How she worried we'd spend all our savings on treatments that wouldn't work. She was scared of the pain, but more scared of leaving us behind. I held her while she cried, both of us smoking and pretending it was helping. The strangest part was how normal it felt after a few days. Like this was just what we did now. Father daughter bonding over beer and cigarettes. Because the universe dealt us the worst possible hand. The next morning, Doctor Martinez called while we were having breakfast. She put it on speaker like always, turning the volume all the way up. He sounded strange, like

Our chemistry teacher, Mr. Rodriguez, had this insane rule. If your phone made any sound during class, he'd lock it in his desk for a full week. Not the day, the entire week in your year. Everyone knew someone who'd lost their phone to him. He kept them like trophies in his desk drawer, grinning whenever kids begged to get them back. There was this quiet kid, Marcus, who worked nights at McDonald's to help his mom pay bills. His twelve year old sister, Lily, walked home from Jefferson Middle every day through this sketchy area near the auto shops on Fifth Street. She was supposed to text Marcus the second she got home. One Tuesday, during our midterm, Marcus's phone buzzed just once. A text. Rodriguez didn't even look up from his crossword puzzle. Just held out his fat hand phone. See? See you next Tuesday, Mr. Johnson. Marcus went pale. Please, Mr. Rodriguez, my sister should have put it on silent. Your poor planning isn't my emergency. Marcus actually got on his knees, begged, explained about his mom's double shifts at the hospital, about Lily being alone, about the creeps who hung around that neighborhood. Rodriguez just smiled and slid the phone into his desk. Maybe you'll think twice next time. That afternoon changed everything. Lily never made it home. Some freak in a white van had been watching Jefferson middle for weeks. When she tried calling Marcus first Like she always did when scared. His phone. Phone just rang in Rodriguez's locked drawer. She was missing for four hours. Four hours of Marcus pacing the McDonald's parking lot, checking the time, knowing something was wrong, but having no way to know what. Police found her behind the Valvoline on eighth three. Physically okay, but she wouldn't stop shaking. Wouldn't talk for three days. Marcus came to school the next morning looking like he'd aged ten years. He walked straight to Rodriguez's room during lunch. I need my phone back, he said, voice barely a whisper. Rodriguez was eating a Turkey sandwich. Didn't even look up. Rules are rules, Mr. Johnson. See you Tuesday. Marcus stared at him for a long moment, then walked to the unlocked chemical supply cabinet. Rodriguez was too lazy to secure it properly.

I was the it guy at a small architecture firm. Nothing fancy, just 15 people designing houses and small office buildings. Everyone called me Kevin the computer guy because I was basically invisible until something broke. I liked it that way. Fix the problem, disappear back to my corner desk. Pete. I wasn't the type to make waves. Never complained when people forgot to log out properly or when the coffee machine somehow always broke next to the server room. I just did my job, everything running smooth, and went home to my one bedroom apartment every night. Friday afternoon, I was doing my weekly security sweep of the shared drive. Standard stuff, checking for viruses, clearing temp files, making sure nobody was storing movies in the work folders. That's when I saw a folder I'd never noticed before, exit planning Q3. Usually I stayed out of management folders, none of my business. But something made me pause. Maybe it was the way it was tucked between old project files, like someone was trying to hide it. I clicked on it. Inside were three documents. The first two were about some contractor whose project was ending. Normal stuff. But the third file made my stomach drop. Kevin final week prep DOC X. My hands were shaking as I opened it. There was my whole termination plan laid out like a grocery list. Access revoked Wednesday morning, locker Cleaned out by security company, laptop returned, even had a timeline for training some intern to absorb it responsibilities post departure. But the part that really got me was a note at the bottom from the CFO. Do not inform Kevin until Tuesday morning. Need systems running smoothly through server transition. They were planning to use me for 4 more days then throw me away like a broken printer. I sat there staring at the screen for probably 10 minutes. No performance reviews, no complaints, no warnings, nothing. They just decided I was expendable and made a plan behind my back. Instead of storming into someone's office like an idiot, I went home and thought about it all weekend. By Sunday night, I had a plan. Monday morning, I walked into the office carrying a box of donuts from the Good Bakery downtown. Everyone looked confused. I've been bringing treats. That was like seeing a unicorn riding a bicycle. Thought everyone could use some sugar, I said, setting them by the coffee machine. People were actually talking to me more than usual. Janet from accounting even asked how my weekend was. I played it totally normal, making small talk, even helping that intern Derek set up his new workstation. Poor kid had no idea he was supposed to replace me in three days. During lunch, I printed out three copies of that Kevin final week prep document. No dramatic confrontation, no angry emails, just clean copies placed on three desks. While everyone was out eating. First copy went to my direct manager, Tom's desk. Second went to the CFO's office. Third went straight to Mr Brennan himself, the founder who actually built the.

Honestly, Mary, I'm at home. I wouldn't play around like that. It has to be a friend of yours, Lucas, playing a sick prank. How else could he be wearing your jacket? There are loads of jackets like that. And my friends. Doesn't look anything like me. You just have me on your mind. He's digging again. God damn it! Just go away, Barry. Do you have a gun in your house? Don't be stupid, Lucas. I couldn't shot anyone. You don't have to use it. Just show that you're carrying. Does that jacket have your name on the back? Yeah, the team all got one with their name on it. I can see your fucking name. What? What the hell is this? Lucas? Mary, that jacket is in my closet. Shit, he's seen me. Why is he smiling like that? He's coming. Call the cops. Mary, Mary, pick up. I've called the cops, told them there's a break in attempt at your place. But they're coming in half an hour. Mary, are you there? It's in the house. Can't talk. I have to be quiet. I turned off the lights. I'm in a closet with a knife. Hard to type. Shaking too much. Damn it. Hang in there, Mary. The police will be there in 20 minutes. Do you know where he is? It not he. The look it had when it saw me. Lucas. No person could look like that. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

I took it. For what? Why was there any need to lie? I know, I'm really sorry. I just thought you were going to be really mad. You want me to be honest? Of course. That's what I wanted from the start. My dad's not doing well at all. I wanted to send him some money for medicine. Oh my god, I'm really sorry to hear that. Just make sure he's okay. Of course baby. You are so sweet. Thank you for understanding. Hey darling. More medicine? Yeah. I'm sorry baby, but he needed it. Of course my love. I was just making sure. By the way, do you want to hang out tonight? Maybe grab some dinner? I was actually thinking of stopping by to see him. Oh really? It's like a two hour drive. Do you want me to take you? No, it's fine. I was planning to go right from work. Oh shoot. So I might not even see you at all tonight? Probably not baby, but tomorrow. Tomorrow you won't be able to walk. Oh wow, that's what I like to hear hahaha. See you soon baby. See you baby. $800? What did you buy? Is there A problem? I mean, I'm really just wondering what could be that much. I think your dad is good on medicine. It's not just medicine, you asshole. I stocked up his fridge on groceries for the next three months, and I bought him a heater. His house is freezing during the winter. I understand, baby. You're just being the best daughter you can be, and I respect that. Yeah. Thanks. And just so you know, it is a shared account. I put as much money as you put into it. I know, I know. I just want to make sure we are using that money wisely and not spending it on stupid things. So my dad is a stupid thing to spend money on? I didn't say that. I clearly stated that I think it's going to a good use. Whatever. You gonna be home soon? Don't think so. He asked if I could stay another night. Oh, okay. Just let me know if you need anything. Thank you, baby. I was thinking I'll be around the area tonight since I'm helping out my friend down there. You want me to stop by and bring you guys some food? I already told you, I stocked up his fridge with food. Okay, maybe just to say hello, then. It's fine, baby. Trust me. He doesn't like too much going on. He only likes my company. All right. Talk in a bit, then. Alexa, where the fuck are you? With my dad. What are you

Sorry, I don't have this number saved. Who is this? It's Alex from school. How exactly did you get my number? You put it on the board in class today in case we needed any help. No, I didn't. Alex, why don't you tell me how you actually got my number? I got it from Crystal. My daughter gave you my number? That's what I just told you. Yeah, right. Sure she did. It's true. We sit next to each other in math. Alex, that's really manipulative. The whole school knows Crystal is into you. You probably use that to get my number. Who cares if I did? I do, Alex. But what if I'm not into Crystal? You must be lying. Everyone knows you guys are perfect for each other. Everyone is wrong. I've got my eyes set on someone else. Who else could you possibly like, I wonder? Tell me so I can tell Crystal who it is you really like. That way, you don't have to break my daughter's heart. That's gonna be a problem, Miss Chase. Why? I like you, miss Chase. Is this some kind of joke? I see the way you look at me in class. I know you feel the same way. Can you just date Crystal? She looks exactly like me, Alex. Well, not exactly. What do you mean? Well, you have better melons. How dare you talk about a teacher that way. That's also insulting to my daughter. Can't say I'm lying, though, can you? No, I guess not. Regardless, you need to be punished for this. Tomorrow after school, come to my class for detention and come prepared. Hey, Miss Chase, I'm outside your class. You're five minutes late. Alex, where are you? Running some errands. I left five blank pieces of paper with a pen on my desk. Okay, what do you want me to do with it? Write out a long apology using all five pieces of paper and both sides of the paper. What do I need to apologize for? Everything you sent to me yesterday. I didn't say anything that wasn't true. It was still very inappropriate, Alex. You're overreacting, Miss Chase. Also, you aren't allowed to leave my classroom until you're finished. Bruh, I thought when you said come prepared, you meant something else. You're making things worse for yourself. When you finish writing your apology, go home. I'll read over it tomorrow morning. Don't forget to staple the paper together. Fine. I'll get started. Alex, I've read your apology and decided to forgive you. That's great, Miss Chase. I'm just getting ready for school right now. I do have one issue with your apology, though. What is it? I told you to staple the paper together, not glue it. Oh, right, yeah, that's my bad. I was really tired after writing that apology. It's fine. Although next time, use the glue in my classroom. The glue you used was almost impossible. To wash off. Sorry. Also, one more thing. Could you tell Crystal to start doing her math homework? Why can't you do it? Things are rough at home and she won't listen to me. I don't know about this. Please, Alex. If you do, I'll give you a special reward tomorrow. How does a private lesson sound after school? Wait, really? I promise. Okay. I just told her to start doing her homework. What did she say? She said she'll do it. So I guess I'll see you tomorrow after school. Miss Chase, comment for part three?

He keeps texting me. I need to respond. Okay, you need to lie. Say we've never slept together. You sure he will believe that? That's what I always told him. But he knows I spent the night. What should I say we were doing? Just say we watched a movie and slept in different bedrooms. Come on, Rosie, he is never going to believe that. He can't know we've slept together. If he finds out I've slept with anyone, he will send me to a different school. Where would he send you? To that all girls school. He can't do that. Then think of something to say.

All of my bags are packed. I'm ready. Do you want to come over to my house or meet at the airport? Um. Babe? Yeah? Don't tell me you forgot. Um, not really, but I thought Ava already told you. Told me what? Are you okay? Is anyone hurt? Um, this is kind of awkward, but since the house can have six people in, Ava and I thought maybe this trip should be, you know, just for us. Me and all our friends. Huh. And since it's my birthday, I think I should have fun. What are you even saying? I'm at the airport right now. Where are both of you at? Well, we're already on the airplane with all our friends. We're going to the cabin beach house. What? How many of you are there? And who are your friends? It's just me and Ava, then four of her friends. Eric, Jamal, Tyrone, Leslie. What? Well, Ava was supposed to tell you. She's literally such a silly girl. Babe, she definitely just forgot to tell you. Forgot to tell me what? That you won't go with us? And you're telling me this after I took a Week off work and told my friends I'm going to a trip with my girl. Then prepared for a surprise. I won't tell you on a trip that I fully paid for. Look, I'm so sorry, babe. All of my friends really appreciate you. We will love you. And they all said you're a great guy for this. They wanna hang out with you after this trip. I organized everything for both of us, me and you. I paid for everything. I only accepted Ava because you wanted her. Tell me you're joking, please. And that is so, so generous of you. I didn't think it would bother you that much, to be honest, because I know you're not an insecure boyfriend. This has nothing to do with insecure. I wanted to spend time with you. I was going to propose on your birthday. Mia, how can you do this? I'm really sorry, babe, but you're always so serious. This is my birthday and I wanted to have fun, make stupid decisions and get wasted. If I went with you, we won't go to the club, we won't ever drink, and we will just go to fun places and swim all day. I only live once, babe, and I want to make the most of it. Just because I don't drink, it doesn't mean I'll stop you. Right, but sometimes you have to let it go. I wanna make very stupid decisions. I don't want you to spoil the mood. For me. I'm only 22. Once in a lifetime. Sorry, babe. But I will make it up for you. When I come back, you can propose to me. We should go to another trip. Just me and you this time. Have as much fun as you want. Visit all the fun places. Eat and swim all day. I still like you as a person. Adam? Hello? Are you there, Adam? Sure. Have fun. Hey, babe. We're at the receptionist.

So I've been watching a few videos on the English language. Cause we all know I'm not real good at fucking learning that, am I? But it poses a few questions. For instance, the word physical, right? The PH at the start makes an F sound. But if you think of the word fucking laugh, the two letters at the end make the F sound, which is a G and an H. And then when you think of the word through, the G and the H at the end don't make any fucking sound at all. But if you take the H and the R out of through, you get fucking tough. And now all of a sudden the GH wants has got something to fucking say about that. Meanwhile you got the letter F sitting over here like a spare dick in a fucking porno doing fuck all. I just don't understand why we put two unrelated letters together to make a sound of a letter that we already possess in the fucking alphabet. Even in the fucking word alphabet, there's a fucking PH instead of a fucking F. Who wrote these words? And who has a fucking vendetta against the letter F? Fuck me. No wonder I'm struggling with these learn English videos. I've been trying. It's fucking ridiculous.

Long time no see. Hey, babe. Yeah, I'm great. How are you doing? I am so great. Thank you for asking. Good. So why don't you go ahead and tell me a little bit about your hair? Are we still happy with what we've been doing? Uh, we gonna go ahead and do what we had planned today, or do you wanna make any adjustments? Actually, I'm glad that you asked. I love the cut, I love the color, and the highlights held up way better than I expected them to. Um, and money has been just a little bit tight this month, so I was wondering if we could just mix the partial highlight and just do the retouch, gloss and haircut. You don't think that you wanna bring any of the blonde up at all whatsoever? You know, it's. It's a little grown out. It has been six weeks. Well, I think it's okay. You know, it looks a little bit like a balayage. I'm liking the intentional lived in look. Uh, so I think next time I would probably wanna move them up so that they don't get so far down and kind of just look like a. Like an ombre. But right now I'm really liking the way that it looks. And like I said, money is a little bit tight. But I. I wanna go ahead and do everything else cause I've got to make sure that these grays are covered. Yeah, okay, so we can definitely do that. Uh, just for a warning, full transparency, I am going to have to charge you a cancellation fee because you are canceling part of your services.

So my wife, Emma, came home last Tuesday with that look on her face, the one all guilty and nervous like she just got caught stealing candy. She sat me down on our ratty old couch and started crying before she even said anything. Turns out she'd been hooking up with her coworker Jake for like three months. Three months while I was working double shifts at the warehouse to save up for our anniversary trip to Florida. She kept saying sorry over and over, begging me not to leave her, promising she'd cut all contact with this guy. I just sat there staring at our wedding photo on the coffee table, the one where we're both laughing because my cousin Rick photobombed us making bunny ears. We looked so happy, so stupid. Emma grabbed my hands and asked if I could ever forgive her. And here's where I became a complete psychopath. I looked her dead in the eyes and said yes. I told her we could work through this, that our marriage was stronger than one mistake, all that bullshit you see in movies. But I was lying through my teeth. The next morning, I called in sick to work and drove straight to Jake's apartment, found his address through Emma's Instagram. She tagged him at some restaurant last month. Dude answered the door in his boxers looking all confused. Introduce myself as Emma's husband and Watched his face go white. Then I very calmly explained that I knew everything and that he had exactly 24 hours to quit his job and move out of town or I'd be paying visits to his parents, his ex girlfriend Sarah, who he was apparently trying to win back, and his boss who definitely didn't know he was screwing around with married co workers. Jake started stuttering about how sorry he was, how it meant nothing. I just smiled and handed him a printed email I'd already drafted to his entire office explaining the situation, told him this would be sent if he wasn't gone by Thursday. Me while at home, I was being the perfect forgiveness husband, made Emma her favorite pasta dinner, bought her flowers, even suggested couple therapy. She was so relieved and grateful, telling me how lucky she was to have such an understanding husband. Thursday came and Jake was gone. Just like that, Emma came home from work all confused because apparently he'd quit without notice and moved back to Ohio or something. She kept asking why he just disappear like that. I waited exactly one more week, let her think we were rebuilding our trust. Then last Friday, I casually mentioned over breakfast that I changed my mind about the whole forgiveness thing. Her face went from confused to terrified in about two seconds. I told her I'd known.

Just got a DNA match notification this morning. Apparently there's a David from Miami who's also looking for answers. The doorbell rang through the window. I could see a young woman with Mom's exact nose and chin standing on our porch holding a wrapped present. That'll be Jessica, I said. Walking toward the door, I told her we were having a family reunion. Sarah finally found her voice. You planned this whole thing. You gave me six months to prepare after I took that DNA test. I shrug. Did you really think I'd just sit on information this explosive? I opened the door. Jessica, come in. Meet your biological family. Jessica walked in looking exactly like mom did in old photos. Hi, everyone. I'm so excited to finally meet you all. The silence was deafening. Dad was gripping his chair so hard his knuckles were white. Mom looked like she might faint. Jessica's a pediatric nurse, I announced carefully. She brought cookies she baked herself. Isn't that sweet? Jessica smiled nervously at the shocked faces. I hope I'm not intruding, Jake said. This was a good time to meet everyone. Oh, it's perfect timing, I said. Sarah here was just questioning whether I belonged in this family. Turns out the real question is whether this living room is big enough for all of Mom's children. My phone buzzed. Oh, Michael just landed. He'll be here in 30 minutes. I looked around at their devastated faces. You know, What? I think I'll go help Jessica bring in her luggage. She's staying for the week. As we walked outside, Jessica whispered, are they always this quiet? Don't worry, I said, glancing back at the chaos through the window. They're just processing some new family dynamics. By the way, Michael's bringing his twin daughters. They're 8 and absolutely adorable. Jessica's eyes lit up. I've always wanted nieces. Well, you're about to have plenty of family, I said. Emma has two little boys and David mentioned he has a teenage son who's excited to meet everyone. Through the window, I could see Sarah trying to fan mom with a Christmas card while dad paced around the living room like a caged animal. Should we go back in? Jessica asked. Look, I'm concerned. Let's give them another minute, I said. They're still adjusting to the fact that they're black sheep. Just became the family detective. Sometimes the truth doesn't just set you free, it redefines everyone's understanding of what family really means.

I was definitely Dad's biological son. Dad's victory dance and high fives with Kyle lasted exactly 10 seconds. However, the lawyer continued clearing his throat. There's something else the family needs to know about. Your grandfather actually left a second, more recent will that supersedes the first one. The room went dead silent. You could hear Linda's phone camera clicking. I pulled out my phone and played a video I'd recorded with Grandpa just weeks before he passed. His shaky but determined voice filled the entire office. To my son Harold and his family, who abandoned me in my final years, who only called when they needed money. You get absolute we nothing. To my grandson Noah, who stayed by my side, who drove me to chemo appointments, who held my hand when I was scared. The house, the life insurance, the savings account. Everything is yours. You earned every penny through love, not blood. Dad's face turn completely white, then red, then purple. That's not legally binding. He was senile. Actually, the lawyer smiled, sliding papers across the table. It's perfectly legal. Signed, witnessed and notarized. Just three months ago, when his mind was completely sound. I have medical records to prove his mental competency. Kyle started yelling about how unfair it was. This is bullshit! We're his real family! Linda was frantically texting, probably trying to spin this disaster to her friends. Uncle Robert, Just sat there with his mouth hanging open. I stood up slowly, looking each of them in the eyes. Thanks for making this so public, dad. Now everyone in the family knows exactly who you really are. Grandpa always said actions speak louder than words. As I walked toward the door with my copy of the will, dad grabbed my arm. This isn't over. I'll sue you for everything. I smiled and pulled out another document. Actually, it is over. This is Grandpa's final letter to you. Want me to read it out loud? His grip loosened. I shook free and headed for the exit. You're dead to me! He screamed. I turned back one last time. Funny, that's exactly what Grandpa said about you. The last thing I heard was Linda sobbing about their reputation as the door closed behind me.

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently in just her school clothes, no coat, tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out, he said. I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key, Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected, sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning. I told her actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's Pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full while bulging at the seams. Her favourite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me, nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter. Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever, but I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years, the man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me. He Picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear, from rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialed a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine. It's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed months ago? File everything Tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my daughter. I hit another number. Dad, it's happening. Can you come get us? Bring the truck, Caroline. You can't just take her. Jonathan jumped up from the couch. I smiled.

Wish I could help. I say genuinely meaning it. I liked the Hollowgate team. By 10:45, Marcus, our CEO, is calling me personally. Randy, there's been a misunderstanding. Can you come in? No misunderstanding. I was terminated yesterday effective immediately. Look, maybe Jessica was hasty. We can work this out. Sorry, Marcus, but I can't legally represent the company anymore. I'm not an employee. As a consultant, then name your rate. I'm not available. Which was true. I had a phone interview with Drift Shade limited at two PM, Hollowate's biggest competitor. According to Beth's increasingly frantic texts, the hollowate team gave Jessica exactly 23 minutes to use the technical documentation they'd specifically flown into review. When she couldn't deliver, they politely excused themselves and said they'd reassess their partnership options. At noon, Jessica calls me directly, voice shaking. Randy, you have to help me. This is sabotage. This is consequences. Jeff, I can report you for withholding company information. What information? I took my personal belongings when you terminated me. All official files remain on your servers. Those notebooks contain proprietary data. Those notebooks contain my personal work. Notebooks purchased with my own money. Check my employment contract. She hung up. Two hours later, my wife forwards me a screenshot from LinkedIn. Jessica had posted about exciting restructuring opportunities, trying to spin the disaster as strategic plan. The comments were brutal. Three former clients asking where I'd gone, two competitors offering condolences. Even our supplier in Germany asking If we were still operational by four PM after a promising interview with Drift Shade, I had my answer to Jessica's sabotage accusation. I hadn't sabotaged anything. I'd please taking my knowledge with me when they showed me the door. Monday morning, I accepted drip shades offer, Senior Director of Client Relations, 35% salary increase, equity options and a signing bonus. Wednesday, Beth texted me, hollowgate canceled their contract. They're switching to Drift Shade. Also, Jessica got fired. Marcus discovered she'd been inflating her performance metrics for months. Thursday, my new phone at Drift Shade rang. Randy, this is Tom Chen from hollowgate. We heard you joined the team. When can we schedule that technical review? Sometimes the best revenge is simply stepping out of the way and letting people destroy themselves.

When I was 16, my dad told me I had to get a job or he'd kick me out of the house. And the only one I could find was at Build a bear. On my first day, I had to learn all the happy dances you do when a kid comes in. And after an hour of that, I was completely on my own. My manager left me there by myself, so I was really nervous. But I noticed a couple come in and the woman was very pregnant. They didn't have a kid with them, but I still helped them pick out a bear along with a fancy heart that had a heartbeat. They still didn't look happy at all, so I tried to cheer her up and made the woman do the happy dance before I stuffed the bear for them. I could see they were both still really upset and not knowing what to do. I made the mistake of asking her if she was okay. She just looks up at me and told me they were there to make a bear for her baby be to be buried with because they had just found out their baby's heart wasn't beating anymore. I immediately stopped trying to make her dance and could barely keep it together as I made the bear for her. It took everything I had to keep a smile as I helped them. Pay. But as soon as they left, I ran to the back and completely bawled my eyes out. My manager came back to the store a minute later, saw the huge line and then found me crying in the back. I tried to explain what happened, but he just told me to get out because I was fired.

Dad said, you're being dramatic. The blood test proved everything I already knew. I was 17 when it started. Every night after dinner at our house in Portland, I'd end up doubled over in my room, clutching my stomach. It didn't matter if it was lasagna, roast chicken, or her special chili. The pattern was too perfect to be coincidence. Relax, Mia, my dad muttered one Sunday, glancing at his iPad. You're dramatic like your mother. Meanwhile, Sabrina, my stepmom of eight months, would hover beside me, her hand on my shoulder. Poor thing, she'd coo, her glossy red nails digging slightly into my sweater. Maybe I'll make my ginger tonic. Works wonders. The smell of anything she prepared made bile rise in my throat. By November, I'd lost nearly 15 pounds. At school, my best friend Chloe cornered me near the vending machines. Mia, this isn't the flu. It's her. You don't get sick when you eat here. I shook my head. That's insane. Insane, she said flatly, is pretending you don't notice. Your dad's trust fund kicks over to you at 18, right? And until then. She let the sentence hang. My heart pounded. Mom had left me a 2 hundred thousand dollar trust. When she passed, dad controlled it. But if I didn't make it to 18, it all reverted to him and his wife. The breaking point came the night of Dad's work banquet in December. Sabrina insisted I Drink her smoothie for energy. I secretly poured it down the sink before we left. Hours later, she leaned close, whispering, funny. You look so much better tonight. Maybe you're finally appreciating me. That was when I knew Chloe was right. The next morning, Chloe marched me to her aunt's clinic on Burnside. Aunt Lila, a nurse practitioner, listened quietly while we described months of symptoms. We'll run a Tox screen, she said, sliding a tray of vials closer. If someone's slipping you something, it will show. Her tone was so

So you remember you're not part of this family. While dad laughed hysterically. I'm 29. Always been the odd one out in the Peterson family. Different hair, different build, different everything. They joke about the mailman constantly. So when Sarah handed me that DNA kit with a smirk and time to prove what we all know, I wasn't even surprised. Dad was cracking up. Mom nodding like she'd been waiting years for this moment. Fine, I said, but let's make it interesting. How about we all take DNA tests, you know, for science? The room went quiet. Sarah laughed nervously. Why would we need to? Because I already took one six months ago, I said. Pulling out my phone and according to 23 and me, I have a half sister named Jessica. Been looking for her biological family. I showed them Jessica's profile. Same last name as Mom's Maiden name, same distinctive birthmark mom has on her wrist. Jessica was born nine months after Mom's business trip to Chicago in 1995. Remember that trip, mom, the one where you couldn't be reached for three days? Mom's face went white. Dad stopped laughing immediately. Oh, it gets better. I continued scrolling through my phone. Jessica wasn't the only surprise. I have three half siblings from Mom's various work conferences. I showed them photos. This is Michael from Denver, born in 1998. Ring any bells about that marketing seminar you attended? Alone. Sarah grabbed the phone. That's not possible. And here's little Emma from Portland, born in 2,001. Funny how she has the same rare eye condition as Mom. Dad's face was turning red, but not from laughter anymore. Linda, what the hell? Is this the best part? I pulled out a thick envelope from my jacket. I've been in contact with all three of them for months. They all want to meet their biological mother. In fact, they're driving here right now. Mom stood up shakily. You didn't. I did. Jessica should be here in about an hour. Michael's flying in from Denver tonight. Emma's parents are bringing her tomorrow morning for Christmas brunch. I looked at Sarah, who was still holding the DNA kit. tell me again about not being part of this family, because it looks like you're about to have a lot more family than you bargained for. Dad was staring at mom like he'd never seen her before. 26 years, Linda, 26 years of marriage and you've been lying about three children. Actually, I said, checking my messages.

My sister Kayla has always been that person who thinks rules don't apply to her. Growing up, she'd borrow my clothes without asking, eat my leftover pizza from the fridge, somehow always convince our parents that I was being unreasonable when I got mad about it. But this time she went way too far. I've been saving up for three years to buy my car, a used Honda Civic that wasn't fancy but was mine. I worked weekends at target, did odd jobs for neighbors and basically lived off ramen noodles to make it happen. When I finally bought it last month, I was so proud. It represented freedom, independence, all that good stuff. Kayla has her own car, by the way, a newer Nissan that our parents helped her buy because she's always been the favorite. But apparently that wasn't good enough for her Friday night plans. I was getting ready for work that morning when she knocked on my bedroom door. Hey, can I borrow your car tonight? Mine's making this weird noise and I don't want to risk breaking down on my date with Trevor. I looked at her like she was insane. No, Kayla, you have your own car. Take, get to a mechanic if you're worried. Come on, don't be such a control freak. It's just for one night. I said, no, I need my car this weekend. And Honestly, you've never asked to borrow anything before. You just take it. So no. She rolled her eyes and stormed out, slamming my door hard enough to rattle the picture frames on my wall. I thought that was the end of it. I went to work, came home around six, didn't think about it again until I woke up Saturday morning and looked out my window. My parking spot was empty. At first I thought maybe I was still half asleep and forgot where I parked. But no, my car was definitely gone. I checked the street, walked around the block, nothing. That's when I noticed Kayla's Nissan was still in the driveway looking perfectly fine. I called her phone about 15 times straight to voicemail. Every time I texted her demanding to know where my car was. No response. I even went to her room and pounded on the door, but she wasn't there. My mom found me in the kitchen, stress eating cereal at noon. What's wrong with you today? Kayla took my car without permission after I specifically told her no. Do you know where she is? Mom just shrugged. She mentioned something about spending the weekend at Trevor's place. I'm sure she'll bring it back. That's not the point. She stole my car. Don't be so dramatic. She's your sister. She probably just needed it for something important. This is exactly the kind of response I expected from my mom. Kayla could probably burn the house. Down and mom would find a way to excuse it. By Sunday afternoon, I was done playing games. Still no word from Kayla, still no car. I had to work Monday morning, and I wasn't about to beg my parents for a ride like some middle schooler. So I called the police. I need to report a stolen vehicle, I told the dispatcher. The officer who came to take the report was this older guy named Officer Martinez, who seemed genuinely concerned. I explained the whole situation, how I'd explicitly refused to let my sister borrow the car, how she'd taken it anyway, how she'd been ignoring my calls for two days. Do you want to press charges, he asked. I hesitated for maybe half a second. Yes. About an hour later, my phone exploded with texts, first from Kayla. Are you insane? The cop.

The real problem started about three weeks ago when I was making breakfast on a Saturday morning. I had some thick cut bacon sizzling in the pan and the smell was filling up the whole kitchen. Emma came downstairs in her pajamas, took one whiff and completely lost it. She started screaming about how I was torturing innocent animals and how the smell made her want to throw up. Then she demanded I stop cooking bacon in her house. I laughed and told her it was actually my house since I pay the mortgage and I'd cook whatever I wanted in my own kitchen. She stormed off to her room and slammed the door so hard the whole upstairs shook. My wife Carol tried to play peacekeeper and suggested maybe I could cook bacon when Emma wasn't home. I said absolutely not. This is my house. I've been eating bacon for 43 years and I'm not changing my breakfast routine because a teenager watched some documentary about farm animals, things Got worse over the next few days. Emma would come downstairs every morning while I was cooking bacon and stand there with her arms crossed, glaring at me like I was personally strangling a pig, make these dramatic gagging sounds and wave her hand in front of her nose. One morning she even brought down her phone and started recording me cooking, saying she was going to post it online to show everyone what a heartless animal abuser her dad was. I told her to put the phone away or I take it for a week. She called me a fascist and stomped back upstairs. The breaking point came last Tuesday. I was making my usual bacon and eggs before work when Emma came down with this big poster board. She'd made a sign that said bacon equals murder in huge red letters and taped pictures of cute baby pigs all over it. She planted herself right next to the stove and held up this sign while I was trying to cook. I ignored her for about 5 minutes, but then she started making these weird squealing noises that were supposed to be pig sounds. My neighbors could probably hear her through the windows. I finally snapped and told her to knock it off or she was grounded, looked me dead in the eye and said, ground me then pigs and factory farms get better treatment than I do in this house. That's when I lost it. I Turned off the stove, grabbed her sign and ripped it in half. I told her I was done with her drama queen act and that she had two choices. Their deal with me cooking bacon in my own kitchen or find somewhere else to live when she turns 18. Emma started crying and ran upstairs. Carol came down a few minutes later and told me I was being too harsh. She said maybe we could compromise somehow, like I could use the electric griddle on the back porch when I wanted bacon. I said, hell no, I'm not cooking my breakfast outside. Like some kind of.

So my husband Jake and I have been married for 2 years and his mom, Carol, has always been this really passive aggressive type who makes these little comments. When we got engaged, she literally said, oh, well, I guess everyone finds someone eventually. Real charmer, right? Anyway, last month, Jake's whole family was coming over for Sunday dinner, his parents, his sister Beth, her husband and their two kids. Carol had been dropping hints for weeks about how she hoped I'd make an effort since the whole family would be there. She kept texting Jake about how his grandmother's pot roast recipe would be so meaningful and how important family traditions are. The thing is I actually cook pretty well. I make homemade bread. I can do a decent roast. I've even made Jake's favourite lasagna from scratch. But this particular Sunday, I had been working double shifts all week at the hospital where I'm a nurse and I was absolutely exhausted. Like could barely keep my eyes open. Exhausted. So Saturday night, I'm standing in my kitchen at nine PM and I realize I have literally nothing planned for this dinner. The grocery stores are closed. I've got maybe half a package of ground beef in my freezer and some random vegetables. I'm panicking because I know Carol is going to have something to say no matter what I make. Then I remember I've got this box of Kraft Mac and cheese in my pantry, not even the fancy kind with the cheese sauce packets, just the regular powder stuff. And something in my brain just snapped, like, you know what, I'm done trying to impress this woman who's never going to like me anyway. So Sunday comes around and I make this Mac and cheese. Here's the thing. I don't just dump it in a bowl. I transfer it to my nice serving dish, the one we got for our wedding. I even put a little paprika on top to make it look fancy. I set the table with our good China and light some candles. The family shows up at five PM sharp Carol is one of those people who's exactly on time for everything. Jake lets them in and I can already see Carol scanning the kitchen, probably looking for signs of whatever elaborate meal she's expecting. We all sit down at the table and I bring out this beautiful serving dish. Girl's face just lights up because she thinks I finally made something worthy of her precious family dinner. She's probably thinking I made some fancy baked Mac and cheese with three different cheeses or something. I serve everyone their portions with this big smile on my face. The kids dig in immediately because let's be honest, kids love Mac and cheese. But then Carol takes her first bite and I watch her face just freeze. She chews really slowly and I can Literally, see the moment she realizes what she's eating, her eyes get wide and she looks at Jake.

My 16 year old son Jake had been saving up for 2 years to buy his first car. He worked at this local pizza place every weekend, did yard work for neighbors and even sold his old gaming console to scrape together enough money. Finally bought this 2,015 Honda Civic with 120,000 miles on it. Nothing fancy, but it was his and he was so proud of it. The car meant everything to Jake. He'd wake up early just to wash it before school, spent his lunch money on air fresheners and even bought those fuzzy dice things to hang from the mirror. Kid was obsessed in the best way possible. Then there's this girl at his school named Haley. She'd been asking Jake to prom for weeks and he kept turning her down nicely because he was already planning to ask someone else. Jake's not the type to be mean about it. But this girl just wouldn't take no for an answer. One Tuesday morning, Jake came running into the house absolutely losing it. His car was completely destroyed in our driveway. Someone had taken a baseball bat to every single window, dented the hood beyond repair, smashed all four tires and spray painted horrible things all over it. The words were so nasty I can't even repeat them here. My heart broke watching Jake just stand there staring At his destroyed car. Two years of hard work gone in one night. The kid started crying right there in the driveway and I hadn't seen him cry since he was maybe 10 years old. We called the cops immediately and they came out to take pictures and file a report. Officer Rodriguez was really nice about it and told us to check if any neighbors had security cameras. Our next door neighbor, Mrs. Kim, has one of those doorbell cameras that points toward the street. When we looked at the footage, there was Haley, clear as day at 2:00am with a baseball bat going to town on Jake's car. She wasn't even trying to hide her face. Whole thing was on camera for about 15 minutes. She really took her time destroying everything. Jake was devastated but also scared because he had to see this girl every day at school. I was furious. It wasn't just some teenage prank. This was thousands of dollars in damage to something my son worked so hard for. The next day, Haley's mom called me up crying and begging me not to press charges. She kept saying Haley was just heartbroken and made a mistake, that her daughter was a good kid who just got emotional over the rejection. She offered to pay for the damages if I would just drop it. Here's the thing, the car was totaled. Insurance wouldn't cover vandalism because we only had basic coverage since Jake was a New driver. The repair estimate came back at almost $8,000, which was more than Jake paid for the car in the first place. Haley's mom then started getting angry. When I told her we were definitely pressing charges, she said I was ruining her daughter's future over a stupid car that colleges wouldn't accept Haley with a criminal record. She even had the nerve to say that Jake probably LED her daughter on and this was partly his fault. I told her that her daughter committed a felony and destroyed my son's property because she couldn't handle being told no. That's not normal teenage behavior. That's criminal behavior. If Haley was old enough.

It all started when my manager, Kevin, kept calling me Jamal. My name is Marcus. I've worked at this insurance office for two years and Kevin has called me the right name maybe five times total. Every email, every meeting, every casual conversation. Jamal this, Jamal that. The worst part? There's actually a guy named Jamal who works in accounting on the third floor. We look nothing alike except for both being black. I corrected Kevin probably 20 times the first month. Hey, it's actually Marcus. Then I tried being more direct. Kevin. My name is Marcus, not Jamal. Then I tried humour. Unless you're planning to pay Jamal salary, you might want to use my actual name. Nothing worked. But Kevin wasn't the only one. Linda from HR called me Deshawn twice in one week. My cubicle neighbour Beth introduced me to her husband at the office Christmas party as Terrell. Even the receptionist who sees my name on packages daily called me Antoine when I picked up mail. I was venting to my girlfriend about it over dinner and she just started laughing. You know what you should do? Start calling them random white names back. See how they like it. At first I thought she was joking, but the more I thought about it, the more genius it seemed. The next morning Kevin walked up to my desk with some paperwork. Morning, Jamal, he said. Dropping The files. Morning, Chad, I replied without looking up. He paused. It's Kevin. Oh, right. Sorry, Kenneth. My bad. He walked away looking confused, but I could tell he thought it was just a one time thing. Boy, was he wrong. I started calling Linda from HR Becky. She corrected me once, then twice, then eventually just gave up. Beth became Brittany, sometimes Ashley if I was feeling creative. The receptionist wrote

Everyone said our cafeteria lady, Missus Morales, was secretly rich, like millionaire rich. We joke about why she'd work serving soggy pizza and mystery meat if she had serious money. The rumor started because nothing about her added up. She drove this beat up 1995 Honda Civic with rust spots and a cracked windshield. But kids noticed she always wore designer shoes, Louboutans, Jimmy Choos, stuff that cost more than most teachers made in a month. Her purse was always Gucci or Prada. But when kids asked about it, she'd act confused, like she didn't know what brands they were. Oh, this old thing found it at goodwill, she'd say with a straight face. Plus, she knew everything about everyone. Which parents were getting divorced, who couldn't afford lunch, whose dad just lost his job. She had this supernatural ability to sense when kids were struggling. She'd quietly slide extra food to hungry students and, and it was just leftovers going bad. I always thought she was just really nosy and incredibly lucky at thrift shopping. Everything changed senior year when my family completely fell apart. Dad lost his construction job when the company went under. Mom was dealing with chronic illness and couldn't work. And we were basically living paycheck to pay check. Some days I'd eat saltine crackers for lunch because that's all we had at home. Missus Morales noticed immediately. She started accidentally making too much food every day, extra sandwiches, leftover soup, cookies that were about to expire. She'd package it up and hand it to me with a wink, always making sure no other kids saw so I wouldn't feel embarrassed. One December afternoon, she pulled me aside after lunch. College applications are due soon. Miho, you applying anywhere? When I told her we couldn't afford application fee he's let alone tuition, she just nodded sadly and squeezed my shoulder. Two weeks later, I got the most shocking phone call of my life. A lawyer said an anonymous donor had established a full scholarship in my name. Four years of tuition, room, board, books, everything covered at my dream school. I immediately suspect did it was Missus Morales. But when I tried to thank her, she acted genuinely confused. That's wonderful, sweetheart. Must be someone who believes in you. But I caught her smiling when she thought I wasn't looking. Throughout college, mysterious checks would appear whenever I needed them. Laptop broke, fixed overnight, couldn't afford textbook. They'd show up on my doorstep. I'd call Missus Morales to tell her about my good luck and she'd always say, god works in mysterious ways. After graduation, I moved across the country for work but sent her Christmas cards every year. She'd write back in her shaky handwriting asking about my job, my girlfriend, my life, always signed, love your cafeteria, mom. Last month, I got devastating news. Missus Morales Had passed away peacefully in her sleep at age 78. I flew back for her funeral, expecting a small service. Instead, I walked into a packed church, hundreds of former students, all looking as confused as I felt about why so many people were there. That's when her lawyer stood up and.

I thought it was a prank. Renee was the girl in the office that made managers forget about their wives. I was the new guy who only spoke to people about code. But then she explained that her hated cousin's wedding was in 90 days and she needed someone tall and handsome so her family would stop pressuring her to find someone would. She conveniently forgot to mention is that the cousin getting married was Sasha. Sasha's cousin, my ex who had left me for my best friend. We drew up an actual contract on my laptop right there. No kissing, hand holding, only when necessary. We'd break up a week after the wedding and we'd split any cash, gifts, 60, 40. Since she was paying me, she made me practice my boyfriend voice in the supply closet. You sound like you're reading a hostage note, she said. Fixing my collar. I had to practice calling her babe without cringing. Rehearse how we met until our story was bulletproof. She taught me her dad liked football and her mom would judge my shoes. The first time I met her parents, I said we met at a conference while she said coffee shop. Her mom's eyebrow raised exactly 1 millimeter, but her dad laughed and said, can't keep your story straight. Must be true love. They grilled me For hours, I left with them believing I owned a ranch back in Canada. Renee made a show of kissing my cheek on the way out. Very theatrical, very fake. But then two weeks in, things started shifting suddenly. At work, we kept our distance, separate lunch breaks, minimal interaction. But she started bringing me coffee without asking, left it on my desk with a sticky note for the performance tonight, oat milk latte, extra shot, which I'd never told her. The family dinners were exhausting at first, all performance, hand holding that felt like a business handshake, practiced smiles. But by the third dinner, I wasn't checking my watch anymore. Her dad and I actually talked football. Her mom taught me recipes while Renee watched with this unreadable expression. Family game night changed everything. When we destroyed her siblings at charades, her dad pulled me aside. I've never seen her this comfortable with someone. That night in the car, Renee was quiet. Sorry, she said suddenly, for what I asked. Just all of this, everything I'm putting you through. I thought she meant the fake relationship. Looking back, she was apologizing for what was coming. Our text conversations evolved, too. First, just logistics, dinner at 7, blue shirt. Then she text after family events, you did good tonight. Then random thoughts at midnight. Then you awake at 2:00am. Followed by 40 messages about co workers, movies, anything she'd mention. My idiot ex who fumbled the best guy ever and I tense up. Seriously, who cheats on someone that amazing? She'd push, watching my reaction. Some people make mistakes, I'd mumble. And she'd look away, guilty about something I didn't understand. Yet one night at the office, both staying late, we finally acknowledged it. This is getting complicated. I, it's just method acting, she insisted, but her hands were shaking. Renee, you brought me soup when I was sick last week that wasn't for your family. She stood up, frustrated. So what if I care? We need to stick to the contract, I said weakly, right? She agreed. But her nephew's birthday party was when pretending became impossible. I did Dinosaur voices to make him laugh. And when I looked up, Renee was staring at me like I'd solved world hunger. Other moms kept asking how long we've been together, and she'd get this soft look. The cake tasting was what broke us both. She started sobbing over chocolate versus vanilla, but I couldn't understand why. I held her in the parking lot while she ugly cried into my shirt. I'm so sorry, Alan. I'm so, so sorry. It's not your fault, I said. Yes, it is, she whispered. And no matter what I said, she refused to feel less guilty. Pretending to care about you is killing me. I finally admitted one night she looked like she might cry. Alan, there's something. I perked up, but then she couldn't bring herself to say it. After the wedding, she said, We'll talk after the wedding. That's when it happened. The rehearsal dinner was the first time I would meet her cousin, the bride. I walked in confident, her hand in mind, ready to charm great aunts and distant cousins. I've been genuinely looking forward to it just to spend more time with Renee. But then I saw her, Sasha, in a pearly white dress. We locked eyes and suddenly the world stopped. Her champagne glass froze halfway to her lips. Then the worst possible thing happened. Kian stepped out from behind her, my ex best friend, wearing a matching pearl white tie. The three of us stood frozen while Renee's relatives milled around clutching cocktails. Renee went rigid. And when I looked at her, I saw it. This was what she had been apologizing for. Sasha started storming toward us. Kian followed her saying, wait, wait, I can't do this. I turned to Renee, please.

My five year old daughter's neighbor. Carlos was a 19 year old who worked three jobs to support his younger siblings. Every morning, he'd wave to Lily on his way to work, and she'd run to the fence to show him her drawings. Lily called him her best grown up friend. One Saturday morning, police cars surrounded Carlos's house. There had been a break in six blocks away, and someone gave them Carlos's name as a suspect. The elderly victim, Mrs. Patterson, was in intensive care, fighting for her life after being brutally attacked during the robbery. The evidence seemed overwhelming. Carlos match the description. Young Hispanic male, about six feet tall. He'd been doing odd jobs in that neighborhood. Most damning, they found Mrs. Patterson's stolen jewelry in his work truck. Though Carlos swore someone planted it there. Carlos was arrested and charged with aggravated robbery and attempted murder. His family couldn't afford a good lawyer. The prosecution painted him as a dangerous criminal targeting vulnerable elderly victims. He. I was looking at 25 years to life for a crime I was certain he didn't commit. I knew Carlos was innocent. I'd seen him that Saturday morning working in our shared garden. But the timeline was tight. That's when I remembered. Lily had been playing in our backyard that entire morning, chattering non stop to Carlos while he worked. She'd been helping him plant tomatoes and asking him a Million questions called Carlos's lawyer about Lily's potential testimony. He was skeptical. Child witnesses are unreliable. But I insisted we try. We spent hours preparing Lily, explaining she needed to tell the truth about that Saturday morning when Carlos was planting vegetables. The prosecution had presented their case with confidence, DNA evidence, witness descriptions, and stolen jewelry. When the defense called Lily to the stand, the courtroom went silent. As this tiny girl walked up to the witness box, the judge adjusted the microphone down to her level. Lily, the lawyer began gently, do you remember Saturday morning when Carlos was working in your garden? She nodded seriously. We were planting the tomato babies. She said clearly. Carlos was very careful with them because baby plants can die if you're not gentle. What else do you remember? She brightened. Carlos taught me about bugs, and he showed me how his hands were all dirty from the special plant food. And he said he couldn't touch anything clean until we wash them. The lawyer asked, did Carlos wash his hands that morning? Oh, yes, she I said proudly. We washed them together at the garden faucet with the special soap. Carlos said dirty hands make everything dirty, so we scrubbed until they were super clean. But then Lily added something that changed everything. And Carlos was very sad about his work gloves. The lawyer asked her to explain.

You'll probably be sleeping by then. I promise you I'll make up for it tomorrow. Alright, I'll say good night then. I hope you have fun. Thanks.

I'm Facetiming Logan, and I can't even hear him over you gaming. Okay, I'll be more quiet, but on one condition. If you stop making all those freaky sounds with him over Facetime. I can hear them, you know, it's just weird, Kyle. I mean, I'm willing to, like, turn a blind eye and not tell mom, but you have to promise that you won't bring Logan over when I'm here. That little chode pisses me the hell off. That's not fair. You're always home. Well, too bad. Guess Mom's finding out about your mysterious sounds at three in the morning. Wait. Okay, fine. But why don't you like him? He just gives off a bad vibe. I can just feel that he's hiding something. And he's constantly on my tip bro. Always hating, thinking he's better than me. Can you stop dissing my boyfriend? I will come over there and beat you right now if you keep pissing me off. Rizz AP says the only beating that's going on is you beating your bean. The only beating that's going on is you beating your bean, Kyle. I'll be quiet. Just stop whimpering, please. Good night. Haley, I have to tell you something really important. No, you don't. You never do. No, I'm being serious right now. I saw Logan with another girl at this party last night. Well, then it's not Logan. Logan's a senior, and you're a freshman. What? Would a senior be doing at a freshman party? Yeah, I know. That's the weird part. The girl he was talking to was a freshman. But it was 100% Logan. I'm sure of it. Like my personal beef with him aside, I don't think you should trust him anymore, Haley. And why would I choose to listen to you? I still trust Logan and he still loves me. What ever. Just know when he cheats on you. Or worse, don't come back apologizing for not believing me. Not happening, because he would never cheat on me. Haley, you have to break up with Logan right now. I already told you, I'm not listening to you. I don't care who you saw doing what. Haley, just listen for once. Remember the party that I saw Logan and the freshman at? You mean fake Logan? Yeah, I wanted to believe that too, but after today I'm 100% sure it's Logan. And why is that? I just saw the both of them at a cafe on like a date. Then when I made eye contact with Logan, he immediately got up and pretended he didn't know the freshman that he was talking to. If it wasn't the real Logan, why would he be scared of some random guy looking at him quickly? Maybe the guy just didn't wanna be seen talking to a freshman. I know Logan. He wouldn't do that. Oh yeah? Text him right now and ask him where he is. Alright, I will. Did you just text him? Five seconds ago? Yeah. How'd you know? I just saw him pull out his phone in the cafe. It's him. Haley, I'm sorry, but I did warn you earlier. It's probably just a coincidence. He just texted me that he was still at his house. Do you have his location? No. God, you're so naive, Haley. Kyle, what the hell did you do? I'm protecting you, that's what I'm doing. Logan just texted me that he's in the hospital and that a bunch of freshman boys jumped him so he couldn't hold off a few. Freshman? What? A baby O'mao. He said it was your friends. Kyle, this is too far. No, it isn't. I'm just trying to keep you safe from that absolute dirtbag. Don't talk to me again, Kyle. Why are you always trying to ruin my life? You'll see soon enough. Kyle, did the freshman that Logan was with have green eyes and wavy black hair? Yeah, her name is Rebecca. She also always wears this hoodie, I think. I can't remember how it looks like. Was it red? Yeah, that was it. It was a blank red hoodie. I'm sorry, Kyle.

Okay, is this, like, he has a pretty crazy search history that includes a kinky fetish type thing, or is it worse? No, it's worse. Um, so I was looking at his iPad because it's connected to his phone, and I had to reset our home, like, security system, and he keeps the code on there in his note section. So I was getting the code, and I noticed one of the sections in his note that was called Gift Ideas. So I was like, hmm, maybe I'll take a quick peek, see if he picked up on the many hints that I've been leaving. Um, so wait. So, wait, so you snoop? So you're a Christmas gift snooper, then? For shame. Yeah, I know. I'm a bad person, but, uh, anyway, I was looking, and I see some. Some of the stuff he was thinking about getting the family and friends, and then I see a name, staff. And I'm like, hmm, I don't know a staff. Um, and I see he was planning on getting her, um, diamond stud earrings. So who. Who the heck is this staff person? So, to your knowledge, he doesn't have, like, a cousin staff or a sibling? It's not his mom's name or his grandma? No. No staff that I can think of at all. And I'm like, well, maybe this is just a coworker. Or a good friend. But still, like, is it even okay for a married man to buy. Be buying diamond earrings for a friend or a coworker? I mean. I mean, it kind of depends, all right? I mean, if it's somebody, maybe they're retiring after many years of working with him. Or are the diamonds, like, teeny, tiny cheapos? Listen, but even if they are, I don't know if a married man has any business buying diamond earrings for another woman for any reason. Has he ever bought you diamond earrings? Yeah, but many, many years ago. Okay, but see, he took care of his wife first. Then I don't know. I don't think there's any reason why a married man should be buying diamond earrings for another woman. See, that's exactly how I feel as well. So. Okay, what do you want us to do then, Casey? I like to know who this staff person is and why he's buying her diamond earring. Okay, well, I'm not sure if we can answer the second question, but we can definitely find out the more important one, which. Who is this staff person? And. And I'm assuming we can call your husband? Yes, absolutely. Okay. And what is his name? I don't think you ever told us. It's John. John. Okay, so hang on a sec, and then we'll get John's number from you, and then we will call him when we come back next. Hello? Hi, can I speak To John, please. Can I ask who's calling? Sure. This is the Z Morning Zoo radio show on Z1O4. Nick, Natalie and Shaggy. Is this John? It sure is. What's up, everybody? Not much. How are you this morning? I'm doing well. I'm doing real well, actually. I feel a lot better if you're about to tell me I won something, though. Oh, yeah? I wish that was why you were calling. Actually, we've been doing something really special on our show this week called Sexy Secret Santa, and that's why we called you. Okay, so the way it works is if somebody's got, like, a special person in their lives and they're kind of, like a secret, they call us and tell us to wish them a very sexy Christmas.

You can't sue me because you let Your emotional support tarantula loose in a restaurant. Oh, I'm sure I could. That is an emotional support animal. And if you harm her or any of her babies, I don't know who I'll call, but I'll figure it out. I will find the right person. What? Hey, there's baby. What? What do you mean, baby? Not yet, but she is pregnant, and I'm hoping to find her before she lays eggs. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I know. That's what I'm saying.

Shush, Sarah. That is none of your business. But, mom, you're always with a new guy every night. And when they are here, you forget I exist. Sarah, you will not interrupt me when I have company around. Mom, I need attention. Ever since dad left when he found another guy home, I haven't got any attention. You will not speak about your dad right now. Mom, is that another guy at the door? I just heard the doorbell ring. Sarah, shush and go to your room. But, mom, I'm starving. Please feed me. Eat the food in the fridge and shut it. Mom, I open the fridge and see nothing but a cold desert. There's nothing there, mom. There's a big tall guy, and he's looking at me through the window. That must be Jamal. Let him in while I work on looking pretty. But, mom, I'm starving. Please. Sarah, shush and let him in. Auntie, can you send me a rizz app line for Mommy? Got you. I won't let you starve. Sarah, tell Mommy this. I would find something to eat, but it seems like you're the only snack in this house. I would find something to eat, but it seems like you're the only snack in this house. Oh, my God, Sarah, how nice of you to make me feel cuter for Jamal. I only have $15 under The mattress in the living room. Go get it and buy something at the gas station. Yay! Thanks, Mommy. Mom, the fridge hasn't been filled up in days. But I always see you out on dates with men. Mommy, please. My tummy is hurting so bad. Sarah, what did I tell you about questioning me? Mommy, please. No. Sarah, Quantavious will be coming to the door very soon, and you will go to your room while I am on my date. But, Mommy, I haven't eaten days. I feel so weak and nauseous. When I was your age, I had to provide for myself. Find something to do while I'm gone. Mom, there's another tall, big man at the door. Could you ask him to buy me some food? Oh, my god, Quantavious is here. I'm leaving now. I'll see you later. But, mom, I don't know how much longer I can hold out. Mom! Sarah, can you open the door? I forgot my key. Sarah, get your little self over here and open this door. I'm not playing with you. If I come around this house and see you inside not coming to this door, you are grounded. Wait, Sarah, why are you on the ground? Oh, my god, Sarah, wake up, please! I'm calling the ambulance.

Nope. This is not just a boy, but many are terrified. We are watching the final seconds of him and his life is being taken right now. People were terrified after Tiktoker nurse Hannah and her family were allegedly ending the lives of their own young ones in front of us, with many claiming the boy has been calling us for help. But it might now be too late. A haunting viral video shows what allegedly appeared like the boy was cowering after being handed a box at a supermarket with many parental experts saying it was not a flinch but seemingly a brace for impact. Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing with many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all. Many to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flipped with even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house and many allege the situation might be much worse than now.

Gregory told us last year when this all came to light that she believed she'd been drugged the night she was arrested. The 22 year old also said Officer Nager left her with bald spots from the forced removal of the hair weave. This kind of behavior is not tolerated at the warm police department. In the case of Gregory's cut off hair weave, arbitrator Nora Lynch issued this 26 page opinion ordering Warren to not only give major her job back, but to give her more than $86,000 in back pay bounded by the taxpayers. But Bernadette Major wanted her job back so her police union appealed her termination through something called binding arbitration. Instead of fighting it out in court for employment matters, an arbitrator can listen to both sides and make a decision. The arbitrator does admit that that cannot be seen in the video and Nature's boss didn't see it either.

A man in Chester County, Pennsylvania maliciously attacked a disabled person with cerebral palsy outside a seven convenience store. Karma gave him the punishment he deserved. On May 10th, 22 year old Jones drove a white SUV to the entrance of a convenience store. He is a mild cerebral palsy patient. The video shows that when Jones walked into the store, 29 year old Barry Baker began to imitate Jones's walking posture. A few minutes later, Jones walked out of the store and Baker continued to mock him, following Jones to his car. Without warning, he viciously punched Jones in the face, and then Jones fell on the hood of the car. However, after the video went viral online, the police began to search for him. Someone discovered that he had his own business, so they bombarded him with phone numbers, making thousands of calls and boycotting his company. When the police arrested him and brought him to court, Baker cried in front of the judge and was sentenced to six years in prison. But that's not all.

What the fuck? Judge Kevin Mullins was S H O T. Dead by town Sheriff Sean Steins in his office in front of the camera. And this judge had previously transformed the county prison into a brothel just to satisfy the perverted desires of himself and that group of filthy accomplices. Arland's and his accomplices would hold such parties in the county prison and other buildings in the town, and would also select prisoners they liked to accompany them. In return, he will reduce the sentences of these participating female prisoners. If any female prisoners are unwilling to participate or refuse to cooperate, he will threaten them with harsher sentences and even say that he will strike at the place where they hurt the most. The most despicable aspect of this entire incident is that everyone in the county knows about it. One of the victims, Tyra Adams, said, anyway, no one will believe what we say. The whole town is involved and no one cares at all. It is said that Sean fired the gun because Kevin was trying to kidnap his wife and children at that time. Just a few seconds before the incident, the sheriff had requested to borrow the judge's mobile phone to call his daughter. It it was during this process that the sheriff discovered that his daughter's phone number was actually stored in the judge's phone. Sean was sentenced to 20 years to life imprisonment for murder. It may even face the death Penalty

She cried the hardest I ever cried in my life. The life changing tragedy had its origins during a vacation in the Caribbean with her husband. Marie says she was using her key card to access her hotel when she accidentally nicked herself on her wrist. It was a tiny little scratch, a silly accident. It hardly hurt. When Marie came home, her dog Taylor greeted her with lots of kisses. But the dog also licked Marie's scratch. Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders. It turns out that her dog's saliva carried a bacteria called capnocytophaga. It's quite common in dogs, but what happened to Marie is a very rare occurrence. Her husband Matthew is doing his best to lift her spirits. I love her to death. She's everything to me.

This time, the focus isn't only on the charges. It's on three signs people can't ignore. First, his shoulders are uneven. Second, his face looks swollen, nothing like earlier photos. Third, in court, he barely spoke. His silence felt unnatural. Together, these details set off alarms to many. It doesn't look like coincidence. It looks like the Mark of violence. Officials haven't said a word. Prosecutors remain locked on the seven felony charges, including aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. But for the public, the case is no longer just about the crime. Is it a camera trick or proof he was attacked? Behind bars, a case that already shocked America now carries a new layer of mystery.

We've been told that Mooney was accused of placing a victim in a restraint chair at the Pike County Sheriff's Office in 2019. This is according to Kenneth Parker, the US attorney with the Southern District of Ohio. So Mooney then is accused of dragging the victim who was still restrained in that chair outside and pepper spraying him twice in the face. Mooni is also accused of punching the victim in the head 11 times and with enough force to break his own hand. Again, this is all allegedly when that victim was still handcuffed and in that restraint chair. Mooney was convicted of two federal counts of violating a victim's constitutional rights by pepper spraying and punching the victim in the head. The jury also found his offenses involved the use of a dangerous weapon and resulted in bodily injury. He was sentenced to more than eight years in prison.

Shut up! At a grocery store parking lot, a father repeatedly beat his toddler son and screamed at him. A bystander recorded the video of this incident which showed the man's aggressive educational approach to the fullest. 44 year old James Collins was in the back seat of his truck shouting at the child and constantly telling him to. During this period, a woman attempted to intervene and then Collins began to shout at her telling her to mind her own business. The child's crying drew a crowd of onlookers, but this did not make James Collins stop what he was doing. Out of concern for the child safety, a bystander called the police. After arriving at the scene, the police promptly arrested James Collins. He has been charged with first degree child abuse and is currently being held in the Gwinnit County Jail with a bail of $4,600. The child was rushed to the hospital. Fortunately, he only suffered minor injuries and is currently receiving treatment from other family members and the Children Services Department. This kind of educational approach is really terrifying. How could he bear to treat such a toddler like this? I hope he will never come into contact with this child again from now on.

I can't live like this. This mom is adjusting to her new normal after losing her hands and legs because of all things, a dog Lick. Marie Trainer woke up from a 10 day coma to find her limbs had been amputated. She cried the hardest I ever cried in my life. The life changing tragedy had its origins during a vacation in the Caribbean with her husband. Marie says she was using her key card to access her hotel when she accidentally nicked herself on her wrist. It was a tiny little scratch, a silly accident. It hardly hurt. When Marie came home, her dog Taylor greeted her with lots of kisses. But the dog also licked Marie's scratch. Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders. It turns out that her dog's saliva carried a bacteria called capnocytophaga. It's quite common in dogs, but what happened to Marie is a very rare occurrence. Her husband Matthew is doing his best to lift her spirits. I love her to death. She's everything to me.

His eyes looked blank and his left shoulder was visibly wider than his right. Many now believe this points to one thing, he may have been beaten in jail. This time, the focus isn't only on the charges. It's on three signs people can't ignore. First, his shoulders are uneven. Second, his face looks swollen, nothing like earlier photos. Third, in court, he barely spoke. His silence felt unnatural. Together, these details set off alarms to many. It doesn't look like coincidence. It looks like the Mark of violence. Officials haven't said a word. Prosecutors remain locked on the seven felony charges, including aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. But for the public, the case is no longer just about the crime. Is it a camera trick or proof he was attacked? Behind bars, a case that already shocked America now carries a new layer of mystery. The nation is waiting for answers. Follow me for the latest updates.

The car ride to the birth center. I had to prank my husband, and I was like, I need to push. I didn't think I wouldn't make it into the building. The owners, who are certified midwives, say they were ready. I put my gloves on, I ran outside, which she's been our client before. We've done her other delivery, and round two was just a lot faster. No one was expecting it to be that fast. By the time we got to the first step, I. The head was coming. My whole goal had been a water birth.

She kept asking the 9 1 1 operator if she was allowed to protect herself with a weapon. The dispatcher comforted her calmly that she had the right to do everything possible to protect her child. When one of the intruders finally broke in, Sarah immediately pulled the trigger and k I l l him. The others were panicked and fled the scene after seeing their companions fall. Sarah remained highly vigilant, holding the child in one hand and a weapon in the other until the police arrived. The authorities later confirmed that Sarah's actions were in line with her legal rights and she would not face any charges. Do you think this Is a legitimate act of self defense.

Instead of using gravel to slow down the truck, they use these wire nets across the whole truck ramp. For 15 years, Marty Phipps has owned the gas station on the corner of Logan Road and Bear Lake Boulevard. We have a new street light in place, and people get cognizant that when it's green, you go, you don't look looking for something like this first truck that took out the sporting goods store. It's kind of sad because that was probably the most valuable piece of property before all this started to happen. And now it'd be tough to, to build there because even with the truck ramp, we're still gonna, there's still gonna be some accidents. Six times in about two years time, the most recent truck made it around the corner on two wheels. The trucks come by so fast, nobody has time to react. The new runaway truck ramp, built by UDOT, is supposed to help truck drivers slow down before they ever get to the Boulevard. When a truck enters this ramp, it'll hit the net, which will initiate the tape rolling out of the spools to slow the trucks down to a safe stop.

People were terrified after Tiktoker nurse Hannah and her family were allegedly ending the lives of their own young ones in front of us, with many claiming the boy has been calling us for help. But it might now be too late. A haunting viral video shows what allegedly appeared like the boy was cowering after being handed a box at a supermarket with many parental experts saying it was not a flinch but seemingly a brace for impact. Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing with many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all. Many to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flipped with even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house and many allege the situation might be much worse than now.

This mom is adjusting to her new normal after losing her hands and legs because of all things, a dog lick. Marie Trainer woke up from a 10 day coma to find her limbs had been amputated. She cried the hardest I ever cried in my life. The life changing tragedy had its origins during a vacation in the Caribbean with her husband. Marie says she was using her key card to access her hotel when she accidentally nicked herself on her wrist. It was a tiny little scratch, a silly accident. It hardly hurt. When Marie came home, her dog Taylor greeted her with lots of kisses. But the dog also licked Marie's scratch. Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders. It turns out that her dog's saliva carried a bacteria called capnocytophaga. It's quite common in dogs, but what happened to Marie is a very rare occurrence. Her husband Matthew is doing his best to lift her spirits. I love her to death. She's everything to me.

This mom is adjusting to her new normal after losing her hands and legs because of all things, a dog lick. Marie Trainer woke up from a 10 day coma to find her limbs had been amputated. She cried the hardest I ever cried in my life. The life changing tragedy had its origins during a vacation in the Caribbean with her husband. Marie says she was using her key card to access her hotel when she accidentally nicked herself on her wrist. It was a tiny little scratch, a silly accident. It hardly hurt. When Marie came home, her dog Taylor greeted her with lots of kisses. But the dog also licked Marie's scratch. Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders. It turns out that her dog's saliva carried a bacteria called capnocytophaga. It's quite common in dogs, but what happened to Marie is a very rare occurrence. Her husband Matthew is doing his best to lift her spirits. I love her to death. She's everything to me.

We've been told that Mooney was accused of placing a victim in a restraint chair at the Pike County Sheriff's Office in 2019. This is according to Kenneth Parker, the U S. Attorney with the Southern District of Ohio. So Mooney then is accused of dragging the victim, who was still restrained in that chair, outside and pepper spraying him twice in the face. Mooney is also accused of punching the victim in the head 11 times and with enough force to break his own hand. Again, this is all allegedly when that victim was still handcuffed and in that restraint chair. Mooney was convicted of two federal counts of violating a victim's constitutional rights by pepper spraying and punching the victim in the head. The jury also found his offenses involved the use of a dangerous weapon and resulted in bodily injury. He was sentenced to more than eight years in prison.

They walked through the doors just before closing time Monday night. They're like, hey, you're open. Great. At the Buffalo Wild Wings on Montgomery and Wyoming. She has a real nice smile on her face. The woman even raised her hands when staff announced they were still open. They sit down and it's a family. It's a mother, a guy and a child. Management tells us they were the only three paying customers left in the restaurant, or so they thought. They walk into the restaurant, a friend, the waitress, they order over $100 worth of food, two large orders of wings, a sampler plate, dessert, drinks to go and more. They leave $150 on the table. The other server sees this and thinks, well, that family is paying for the meal. My friends about to get a really large tip. This is really good. Just one minute to realize that money was fake. But they say what's even more concerning, they're using their child as a ruse, which, you know, we need to talk to them about that.

Judge Kevin Mullins was shot and killed by the town sheriff in front of the camera in his office. He once turned the prison in Lectola County into a brothel to satisfy his and his nauseating friends filthy fantasies. Bollins and his friends organized such parties in the county prison and other buildings in town, selecting the female prisoners they wanted. As a reward for these women, he will shorten their sentences or alleviate any punishment they face. If these women are unwilling to participate or refuse, he will threaten them, either sentencing them to the maximum sentence or kicking them to their most painful place. On March 12th, Sheriff Marshall was invited to a party and discovered that his wife and daughter were also involved. His wife was beaten by Mullen's for disobedience and Sheriff Marshall angrily questioned Mullen's before taking his wife and daughter home. Two days later, his daughter ended her life due to her inability to accept reality. Furious, Marshall rushed into Mullins's office, pulled out his weapon and fired three shots in a row. He died before the police arrived. Now Marshall is accused of first degree murder. He may never see his family again. Do you think he is a hero or a criminal?

A mother pushing a baby carriage walked to the roadside to make way for a car. But what happened next was simply unbelievable. A driver who was going against the traffic crashed straight into them. The mother and son were thrown into the air by the collision and then fell heavily onto the vehicle. The driver of the vehicle involved in the accident fled the scene. I remember hitting the windshield. I broke it with my head. And even worse, I thought my child would. Rachel recalled at that time she was walking down the street with her son Charlie and exchanged a glance with the driver who caused the accident. Two thoughts flashed through her mind in an instant. She was convinced that the driver had deliberately crashed into them. There was a tire Mark on the back of baby Charlie's head and the left front wheel also scratched his head. Rachel had multiple abrasions all over her body and three intervertebral discs on her back were damaged. When the frightened onlookers ran to help, the driver sped away. He didn't stop until a pickup truck blocked his way. After receiving the alarm and arriving at the scene, the police arrested the 16 year old driver who caused the accident. But what enraged everyone was that the teenager confessed to the charges of intentional injury and hit and run, but was ultimately sentenced to serve only 5 to seven months in a juvenile detention.

He pulled out several hundred dollar bills and handed them to the cashier and he actually used the counterfeit pens on them, which worked. Um, once he did that, it appeared that another male that was with them, possibly a lookout, um, he signaled to another girl that was with them to, you know, hey, come up here and do your transaction. That woman and used another several hundred dollar bills to buy a visa gift card. A counterfeit pen also showed that the bills were real. All three walked out of the store and nobody realized anything was wrong. And later on when they were counting the cash in there using a actual cash counter, those bills were all flagged, um, as counterfeit. Detective Nate Lean with the Danville Police Department said the trio scam the store out of 800 dollar Teen Kroger stores in Indiana, mostly in the Indianapolis area, and has cost the supermarket chain nearly $12,000. In all 14 cases, $100, uh, counterfeit bills were used. Um, they're using them to buy the green dot cards, the visa gift cards and what not. And as long as they can get them to pass, that money now turns into legitimate money because it's now on a gift card.

People were terrified after Tiktoker nurse Hannah and her family were allegedly ending the lives of their own young ones in front of us, with many claiming the boy has been calling us for help. But it might now be too late. A haunting viral video shows what allegedly appeared like the boy was cowering after being handed a box at a supermarket with many parental experts saying it was not a flinch but seemingly a brace for impact. Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing with many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all. Many to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flipped with even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house and many allege the situation might be much worse than now.

Gregory told us last year when this all came to light that she believed she'd been drugged the night she was arrested. The 22 year old also said Officer Major left her with bald spots from the forced removal of the hair weave. This kind of behavior is not tolerated at the warm police department. In the case of Gregory's cut off hair weave, arbitrator Nora Lynch issued this 26 page opinion ordering Warren to not only give major her job back, but to give her more than $86,000 in back pay bounded by the taxpayers. But Bernadette Major wanted her job back, so her police union appealed her termination through something called binding arbitration instead of fighting it out in court. For employment matters, an arbitrator can listen to both sides and make a decision. The arbitrator does admit that that cannot be seen in the video, and Nature's boss didn't see it either.

We've been told that Mooney was accused of placing a victim in a restraint chair at the Pike County Sheriff's Office in 2019. This is according to Kenneth Parker, the U S. Attorney with the Southern District of Ohio. So Mooney then is accused of dragging the victim, who was still restrained in that chair, outside and pepper spraying him twice in the face. Mooney is also accused of punching the victim in the head 11 times and with enough force to break his own hand. Again, this is all allegedly when that victim was still handcuffed and in that restraint chair. Mooney was convicted of two federal counts of violating a victim's constitutional rights by pepper spraying and punching the victim in the head. The jury also found his offenses involved the use of a dangerous weapon and resulted in bodily injury. He was sentenced to more than eight years in prison.

Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing with many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all. Many to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flipped with even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house and many allege the situation might be much worse than now.

She cried the hardest I ever cried in my life. The life changing tragedy had its origins during a vacation in the Caribbean with her husband. Marie says she was using her key card to access her hotel when she accidentally nicked herself on her wrist. It was a tiny little scratch, a silly accident. It hardly hurt. When Marie came home, her dog Taylor greeted her with lots of kisses. But the dog also licked Marie's scratch. Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders. It turns out that her dog's saliva carried a bacteria called capnocytophaga. It's quite common in dogs, but what happened to Marie is a very rare occurrence. Her husband Matthew is doing his best to lift her spirits. I love her to death. She's everything to me.

Judge Kevin Mullins was s h o t dead by town Sheriff Sean Steins in his office in front of the camera. And this judge had previously transformed the county prison into a brothel just to satisfy the perverted desires of himself and that group of filthy accomplices. Arlins and his accomplices would hold such parties in the county prison and other buildings in the town and would also select prisoners they liked to accompany them. In return, he will reduce the sentences of these participating female prisoners. If any female prisoners are unwilling to participate or refuse to cooperate, he will threaten them with harsher sentences and even say that he will strike at the place where they hurt the most. The most despicable aspect of this entire incident is that everyone in the county knows about it. One of the victims, Tyra Adams said, anyway, no one will believe what we say. The whole town is involved and no one cares at all. It is said that Sean fired the gun because Kevin was trying to kidnap his wife and children at that time. Just a few seconds before the incident, the sheriff had requested to borrow the judge's mobile phone to call his daughter it it was during this process that the sheriff discovered that his daughter's phone number was actually stored in the judge's phone. Sean was sentenced to 20 years to life imprisonment for murder. It may even face the death penalty.

Fisher had befriended the child's mother and the child was left in his care on the day she died. During the sentencing, District Attorney Antonia Edwards said Fisher used Clorox wipes to try to conceal his crimes, scrubbing the child's face so hard he rubbed off the pigment. He used these Clorox wipes throughout her body, even placing them inside of her body. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison after taking a plea deal which was only offered to him so the family would not have to sit through a trial and learn the horrible details of his crime. Fortunately, he was recently found dead whilst in prison. The prison refused to reveal the cause of death, which is expected to be revealed by the medical examiners. Let me know your thoughts on this in the comments. What do you think happened to him? Was it self inflicted or did the other inmates get to him?

Los Angeles police found blood stains when they searched the residence of 20 year old singer David Burke. There is evidence suggesting that David got Celeste Rivas pregnant before she was K I L. L. When authorities searched David's residence, they focused on looking for blood stains. It was reported that police were seen conducting a search outside a house in the area and eventually took away a computer and several items. The house was reportedly rented by David's agent. Another Twitch live stream video featuring both David and Celeste has been exposed. In the video, David repeatedly asked the administrator to delete all the clips and the live stream replay. There is another photo circulating online. TMZ claims to have investigated the photo and found that the location in the photo is only a 6 minute walk from where Celeste lived before she went missing a year ago. There are just too many things that don't make sense about all this. May Celeste rest in peace

But it might now be too late. A haunting viral video shows what allegedly appeared like the boy was cowering after being handed a box at a supermarket with many parental experts saying it was not a flinch but seemingly a brace for impact. Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing with many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all. Many to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flipped with even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house and many allege the situation might be much worse than now.

Thirty four year old Robert Fisher was sentenced to 20 years to life behind bars for the rape and murder of three year old Josephina Cunningham. Fisher had forced the girl to consume her mother's medication. He then attacked her and tried to cover up what he had done. Fisher had befriended the child's mother and the child was left in his care on the day she died. During the sentencing, District Attorney Antonia Edwards said Fisher used Clorox wipes to try to conceal his crimes, scrubbing the child's face so hard he rubbed off the pigment. He used these Clorox wipes throughout her body, even placing them inside of her body. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison after taking a plea deal which was only offered to him so the family would not have to sit through a trial and learn the horrible details of his crime. Fortunately, he was recently found dead whilst in prison. The prison refused to reveal the cause of death which is expected to be revealed by the medical examiners.

A haunting viral video shows what allegedly appeared like the boy was cowering after being handed a box at a supermarket with many parental experts saying it was not a flinch but seemingly a brace for impact. Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing with many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all. Many to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flipped with even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house and many allege the situation might be much worse than now.

Judge Kevin Mullins was s h o t dead by town Sheriff Sean Steins in his office in front of the camera. And this judge had previously transformed the county prison into a brothel just to satisfy the perverted desires of himself and that group of filthy accomplices. Arlins and his accomplices would hold such parties in the county prison and other buildings in the town and would also select prisoners they liked to accompany them. In return, he will reduce the sentences of these participating female prisoners. If any female prisoners are unwilling to participate or refuse to cooperate, he will threaten them with harsher sentences and even say that he will strike at the place where they hurt the most. The most despicable aspect of this entire incident is that everyone in the county knows about it. One of the victims, Tyra Adams said, anyway, no one will believe what we say. The whole town is involved and no one cares at all. It is said that Sean fired the gun because Kevin was trying to kidnap his wife and children at that time. Just a few seconds before the incident, the sheriff had requested to borrow the judge's mobile phone to call his daughter it it was during this process that the sheriff discovered that his daughter's phone number was actually stored in the judge's phone. Sean was sentenced to 20 years to life imprisonment for murder. It may even face the death penalty.

His eyes looked blank and his left shoulder was visibly wider than his right. Many now believe this points to one thing, he may have been beaten in jail. This time, the focus isn't only on the charges. It's on three signs people can't ignore. First, his shoulders are uneven. Second, his face looks swollen, nothing like earlier photos. Third, in court, he barely spoke. His silence felt unnatural. Together, these details set off alarms to many. It doesn't look like coincidence. It looks like the Mark of violence. Officials haven't said a word. Prosecutors remain locked on the seven felony charges, including aggravated murder, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. But for the public, the case is no longer just about the crime. Is it a camera trick or proof he was attacked? Behind bars, a case that already shocked America now carries a new layer of mystery. The nation is waiting for answers. Follow me for the latest updates.

An 18 year old single mother in Oklahoma, K I L L an intruder with a weapon to protect her child. Prosecutors have decided not to bring any charges. Sarah McKinley, a young mother, noticed a group of suspicious men loitering around her house, one of whom was holding a crowbar. She recognized that one of them was the person who had been following her recently. Her husband passed away on Christmas Day, leaving only her and her three month old child at home, which made Sarah more and more anxious. He called 9 1 1 for help. But just as she was calling the dispatcher, those men began to try to force their way through the front door. Worried about her and the child's life safety, Sarah picked up her weapon and loaded it. She kept asking the 9 1 1 operator if she was allowed to protect herself with a weapon. The dispatcher comforted her calmly that she had the right to do everything possible to protect her child. When one of the intruders finally broke in, Sarah immediately pulled the trigger and k I l l him. The others were panicked and fled the scene after seeing their companions fall. Sarah remained highly vigilant, holding the child in one hand and a weapon in the other until the police arrived. The authorities later confirmed that Sarah's actions were in line with her legal rights and she would not face any charges. Do you think this Is a legitimate act of self defense.

In the report, mom says the school also mentioned paddling with her and a deputy present. In the report, the mother says she didn't understand the process correctly. Later that day, she went to the school to pay the fee, and they took her into the principal's office. We know the name of the woman with the paddle through a report from the Henry County Sheriff's Office. It says the principal of Central Elementary, Melissa Carter, and Cecilia Self, a clerk, are the two women in the video. We tried to reach them through the school district, but we're unsuccessful. Henry County School District's policy does not allow corporal punishment. It says, quote, the superintendent shall designate sanctions for the infractions of rules excluding corporal punishment. It's now up to the state attorney to decide whether to pursue charges against the principal and the clerk in the video.

She cried the hardest I ever cried in my life. The life changing tragedy had its origins during a vacation in the Caribbean with her husband. Marie says she was using her key card to access her hotel when she accidentally nicked herself on her wrist. It was a tiny little scratch, a silly accident. It hardly hurt. When Marie came home, her dog Taylor greeted her with lots of kisses. But the dog also licked Marie's scratch. Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders. It turns out that her dog's saliva carried a bacteria called capnocytophaga. It's quite common in dogs, but what happened to Marie is a very rare occurrence.

Everyone cheered. I laughed softly and said, then I guess you won't need this. I placed a folder on the table. The moment she opened it, she started screaming. Before we carve the Turkey, Natalie said, rising with that rehearsed smile, there's something we need to say. The room went silent. We had a family vote. You're not family anymore! Cheering. Actual cheering. My cousin Laura clapped like she was at a concert. Uncle Ben raised his wine glass. Even my mother laughed and said, well, someone had to say it. My dad just sipped his beer and muttered, it's probably for the best. Wow, I said, pushing back slowly. You rehearse this? Natalie grinned wider. You've been toxic for years. We're done pretending. It's unanimous, my mother added. I looked around. No one spoke up. Good, I said quietly, reaching into my bag. I figured this might happen. I pulled out a thick folder and placed it in the center. The heavy thought of it hitting the table cut through the laughter. Natalie blinked. What is that? I smiled and folded my arms. Why don't you find out? She snatched it and ripped it open, that snide smirk forming. Then she turned the first page and stopped smiling. Her face went pale. Then she screamed. Blood curdling horror movie scream. Her chair crashed behind her as she bolted upright, slamming the folder shut. You monster! She cried. You messed up freak! Joel! Her husband grabbed the folder. His jaw dropped. Is this. I nodded once. It's all real. Every word, every receipt, every screenshot. Dead silence. You were so sure I wouldn't fight back, I said, standing slowly, so sure I'd stay the quiet one. The doormat. The cash cow. Let me tell you what was in that folder. Five years of records. Over $78,000 sent to family members, all documented. $8,000 for Joel's rehab. Actually a spa retreat. $2,300 for Natalie's emergency dental work, elective veneers. $12,000 for mom's credit card debt. $4,500 for a family emergency. Actually a Cabo trip. Screw. Screenshots of Natalie calling me a cash cow with no spine, posts where they mocked me, texts where she called me manipulative for refusing to co sign her business loan. And the cherry on top, hotel receipts showing Natalie spent three nights in Santa Monica with someone named Alyssa, charged to Joel's credit card. That's what made her scream. She wasn't just exposed, she. It was dismantled, fact by fact. Joel flipped through pages, his face paling. What's this about Santa Monica? Who's Alyssa? Why were you at a hotel for three nights on my credit card? Silence. Let's be reasonable. My mom tried. Sure, I said. Let's talk about when you called me a parasite while cashing my check. We were under stress, she stammered. No, I snapped. You were under stress, and I bailed you out every time. The one time I say no, I'm the enemy. My dad spoke up. You're making this bigger than it is. You let them do this for years. I said, you knew. You saw it. You let it happen because it was easier. You're just bitter because no one needs you anymore. Natalie shouted. Wrong. I said coldly, I'm not bitter. I'm done. You think this

The building manager knocked on my door at 6 a m. Sir, open up or we'll call the police. My neighbour hid behind him, carefully holding a binder labelled evidence. The manager cleared his throat. Sir, we need to discuss some serious allegations. We've received complaints of your stalking behaviour. Would you mind letting us in? I was surprised. Stalking? No, I'm sure this is all just a funny misunderstanding, I said. Thank. What could I have even done that felt like stalking? Then let us in, he insisted coldly. They walked in and immediately started looking around. My neighbor pointed at my balcony. That's where he watches me every morning. Look, there's even a notebook. She grabbed it before I could react and started reading out loud. 5:00am, she left, crying. 602:00am, she came back. 7:00am, she looked tired, didn't eat breakfast. Her hands started shaking in fear. The manager frowned. You're documenting her routine? I shook my head. No. Well, yes, but it's because this goes back three months. Every single day? She asked, covering her mouth. My neighbor spotted my phone on the counter. Stay right where you are. Passcode now, he said, radioing security in case things went south. 2,352, I told. They opened up my gallery and scrolled through the dozens of pictures from the park. She was in every single one. Oh my god, she said, showing the manager. He's been Photographing me everywhere I go. The manager's expression darkened. Okay, I know this looks bad, but please let me explain. I begged, but my neighbor refused, pulling out more evidence. Text messages from her friends. Look, he followed me to the pet store last week. My friend saw him hiding behind the dog food aisle. The manager studied the photos. He always asked me weird questions, too. He's like, are you going anywhere overnight this weekend? And stuff. Like, why would you need to know that? My neighbor was almost crying, and he somehow knew my mom was sick. I never told him that, either. The manager noticed a she's bag by the door. What's in there? Wait. He opened it. Out came five different types of cat food with heating pads and antibiotics. They stared at it completely confused. I side, I've been trying to tell you guys I'm not stalking. Look. I grabbed my phone and opened up the gallery again, zooming into the pictures. Each one had pictures of the stray cats my neighbor started taking care of a few months ago. The manager and my neighbor exchanged looks like I just made up the worst excuse ever. Right, cats, the manager said sarcastically. You expect us to believe you've been stalking her for cats? My neighbor shook her head. That's sick. Using innocent animals as your cover story. No, I just. Look, I said, frustrated, grabbing my note.

I finally successfully snuck my crush over one night without my parents noticing. But as he had to go home, we were almost in the clear. We snuck downstairs. But as soon as we opened the front door, the lights flicked on. I felt my heart stop and saw my dad standing there in his boxers. What the hell is this? He was holding my iPad, scrolling through our texts from earlier where he asked if he could come over after my parents went to bed. My dad charged at him and this poor guy scrambled out the front door while my dad shouting about get out and never come back. Dad's face is purple as he announces, I'm installing cameras, every room, every angle. You wanna act like you can't be trusted? Fine. Now you can't be. Mom stumbles downstairs asking what's happening, but Dad's already on his phone ordering equipment from some security website. I thought he was joking, but by noon, they were literally everywhere, living room, kitchen, hallway, even one pointed at my bedroom door. 47 cameras total, I counted. He sets up this whole command center on his laptop in his room, multiple screens showing every angle of our house like he's running a casino. This is for your safety. There won't be any teen pregnancy in my house. Day three and I can't breathe without dad texting me. I'm doing homework and who was at the Door, it's the mailman. He rushed home one day because he heard me talking on the phone while my friend Reese was coming over to study. He burst into my room thinking Reese was a boy literally holding a baseball bat. However, I started noting weird things going on. I decided to check his camera system myself one day and noticed activity. At 3:00am, Dad emerges from his room fully dressed, jeans, boots, like he's ready to go on a date. Mom's already completely passed out from her long day and doesn't even notice him leaving. He checks the cameras to make sure I'm in bed, not knowing I'm watching him check on me. Then he just leaves. Nothing happens until he comes back at 4:00am, hair messy, sneaks back into bed with mom before she noticed he was even gone. I didn't believe what I was seeing. I had to make sure this was real. But the very next night, one night, the camera catches him coming back with lipstick on his collar that he frantically scrubs off in the downstairs bathroom. I started crying while watching this. My, my own dad even going as far as to say, if I catch that kid around here again, I'll kill him. My mom just laughs. I can't stand watching her live this lie anymore. Saturday night, after dad sneaks out again, I wake mom. There's something you need to see. I show her all the footage, him leaving at 2:00am Coming back to shoveled the lipstick, everything. Mom's face goes from confusion to rage. Oh, my god. After 20 years.

C. In January. The female pilot in this crash was reportedly given several warnings to turn but she did not. New details have emerged about Rebecca Loback, who was the female co pilot of this Blackhawk helicopter. Her male co pilot told her to turn away multiple time, meaning that they identified the American Airlines flight carrying those 64 people. Also meaning that she ignored his request and orders to turn. On Sunday, the New York Times released new detail stating that that co pilot directly told her to turn away. They said not only was the Black Hawk flying too high, but in the final seconds before the crash, its pilot failed to heed a directive from her co pilot and Army, Army instructor to change the course. The Blackhawk was 15 seconds away from crossing paths with the jet. He told her he believed that air traffic control wanted them to turn left towards East River Bank. If they would have turned left, it would have opened up more space between the helicopter and this American Airlines flight. She didn't turn left though. Now, as you guys know, it took quite a while before they would release Rebecca Lobo's name, 3 days to be exact. And sources are claiming it's because they wanted to scrub her social media. So why did they wanna scrub it? Why did she not turn left? We Need more. What happened here and why?

Donnie Birchfield is from Lancaster SC,NA,"A pastor's son kept four adults captive for years in his basement. This is 35 year old Donnie Ray Birchfield of Lancaster, South Carolina. It was recently found that he was keeping four adults captive in his basement, but only because it was finally reported that one of those adults had passed. Now as I've said, a 9 1 1 call was made and it was the day after this woman had died. And so police arrived and they found these other three adults in a basement seemingly controlled by Donnie. They wouldn't leave the basement under his instruction until they came back with a warrant and he had no choice. It was also found that he would deny food, he would deny water. Again, they were not allowed to leave for years from this basement area. They were physically and emotionally abused. Two of these captives were a husband and a wife. The wife is the one who passed. The other two that were being held captive were two women that were both allegedly in a romantic relationship with Donnie. One of them since September of 24 and the other had been with him since 2015. As I said, Donnie is a preacher son from a church in the area. At this time he has been arrested. He has about 16 charges and also financial crime charges because he allegedly used credit cards and took money out of bank accounts and of course as a charges for false imprisonment. Donnie Is being held without bond, but make sure to follow me because I'm gonna keep you guys updated on this one.

Tom no quer√≠a hacerlo, pero no tuvo m√°s opci√≥n que obedecer. Recogi√≥ un mont√≥n de sobras para alimentarlo y el cerdito casi vomit√≥ al oler la comida. Tom no se rindi√≥, tom√≥ una cuchara y trat√≥ de forzarlo a comer, pero el cerdito se resisti√≥ con todas sus fuerzas. Tom prob√≥ un bocado y de inmediato lo escupi√≥. No tuvo m√°s remedio que pedirle a su due√±o que comprara verduras frescas. Sin embargo, el cerdito rechazaba todas las verduras con desprecio. De repente, percibi√≥ un aroma delicioso. Cherry estaba comiendo pastel de cereza. El cerdito lo devor√≥ de un solo bocado. Al ver cu√°nto le gustaba, Tom pidi√≥ a su due√±o preparar m√°s pasteles para alimentar al cerdito y ganar el concurso. El due√±o no tuvo m√°s remedio que aceptar. Pronto, Tom entr√≥ en modo alimentaci√≥n fren√©tica. Ni siquiera pod√≠a seguirle el ritmo al cerdito que com√≠a tanto pastel. La silla se rompi√≥. Bajo su peso tuvo que continuar comiendo apoyado sobre la mesa. El tiempo pas√≥ volando hasta el √∫ltimo d√≠a del concurso. Tom necesitaba una pala para mantener el ritmo de su voraz apetito. Al terminar el √∫ltimo plato, Tom crey√≥ que el cerdito ya estaba lo suficientemente gordo y quiso mostrarle el resultado a su due√±o. Pero el animal estaba tan Obeso que no pod√≠a moverse, Tom intent√≥ empujarlo hacia la salida, pero se atasc√≥ en la puerta. Entonces, cherry tuvo una idea, tom√≥ un poco de lubricante y lo unt√≥ en los costados del cerdito, intentando moverlo con una palanca, pero el cerdito no se movi√≥ ni 1cm. Tom pens√≥ en otro plan, coloc√≥ explosivos en la puerta para abrir paso al cerdito. Al presionar el detonador, nada pas√≥. Al acercarse a revisar, la bomba explot√≥. Finalmente, lograron sacar al cerdito. Tom estaba a punto de limpiarlo y llevarlo con su due√±o, pero debido a su forma redonda, el cerdito rod√≥ cuesta abajo y aterriz√≥ directamente en el escenario del concurso del cerdo m√°s gordo. Todos pensaron que ganar√≠a, pero hab√≠a competidores a√∫n m√°s pesados. El due√±o de Tom perdi√≥ el concurso. Justo entonces vio una competencia de comer pastel de cereza cerca. Inscribi√≥ al cerdito de inmediato y, como era de esperar, gan√≥ el premio. Sin embargo, no fue dinero, sino un enorme pastel de cereza

He rolled straw into a cigarette on a whim. Then to light it, he tore off someone's roof and used a fireplace as a lighter. But that's not all. After lighting the cigarette, he sat on a granary, slowly enjoying it. The villagers were terrified. To calm the people, the king posted a notice to hunt him down. Days passed. No one volunteered. Just when the king was out of ideas, a little Taylor killed seven flies in one smack. Feeling proud, he wanted to show off. Words spread fast. The guards heard about it and immediately told the king. The king summoned the Taylor, asking if he really killed seven. The Taylor thought he meant flies and confidently said yes, even exaggerated a bit. The king was impressed. He gave the tailor the mission defeat the giant. The tailor was stunned. Before he could protest, the king added, complete this and the princess is yours. Before he knew it, the princess ran over and kissed him. Wildly, the tailor accepted the task. The villagers cheered as he left the city gates. When the gates closed, he snapped back to reality. Scared, he tried to go back. Seeing the hopeful faces of the people and Princess, he couldn't refuse. With a racing heart, he set off. A little tailor versus a giant. He had no idea what to do. The ground shook. A massive shadow loomed. He looked up, almost crushed by the Giant's 45 foot, foot. Panicking, he ran through the forest. He reached a lake, thought it would slow the giant. But to him, it was just a puddle. No use at all. Finally, the Taylor hid inside a pumpkin. The giant, tired, sat on a nearby house to rest. He spotted the Taylor and was stunned. Worse, he grabbed the pumpkin and the Taylor was inside. Naturally, he got tossed into the giant's mouth. Luckily, while the pumpkin rolled, the Taylor grabbed the giant's pendulum hammer. The giant thought he choked, drank a ton of water, and the tailor was swept into the stomach. Luckily, he grabbed a bell rope and pulled himself out as the giant yanked. But now the giant spotted him. With nowhere to run, the tailor pulled out Scissors. The angry giant slapped down. But the Taylor hid in his sleeve. The giant reached in. Exactly what the Taylor planned. He sewed the giant's hand through the slit. Done, he climbed onto the giant's head, threw a rope around its nose. The giant couldn't resist. The tailor wrapped the rope down all the way to its feet. A strong pull and the giant tumbled to the ground. With the giant subdued, the Kingdom built an amusement park powered by the giant's own breath.

I was sitting on the edge of our bed, crying my absolute eyes out because I just got a call telling me that my mother had passed away in her sleep. My wife, Sonic, walked through the door, saw me crying, and instead of comforting me, she said, the kitchen sink is clogged again. I looked up at her, trying to process what I just heard. Sonic, I just found out my mom died. She stood there in the doorway, arms crossed, and I'll never forget what came out of her mouth next. Okay, but that's not my problem. My problem right now is the kitchen sink, and I want it fixed. The words hung in the air between us like poison. 23 years, a whole life built together. And she was standing there telling me my mother's death wasn't her problem because the damn sink was clogged. I sat there staring at her, waiting for her to realize what she just said. Maybe take it back. Show some sign she was human. Are you serious right now? I asked, my voice barely a whisper and still rough from all the crying. Do you even love me? She actually rolled her eyes. Grow up, Dave. Your family problems aren't my problems. The sink needs to be fixed, and I have friends coming over in an hour. My family problems aren't her problems. That's What she had to say in response to my mom dying. I stood up, walked past her to the kitchen, and fixed the sink. It took me 10 minutes. Then I sat alone in our bedroom to plan my mother's funeral. And realized the woman I'd married was a stranger. That night, I made a decision. If that's how she wanted our marriage to work, that's exactly what she'd get. Three weeks after Mom's funeral, I was in the garage working on my car when Sonic burst through the door. She was on the phone with her brother, yelling about some emergency. Hold on, I'm getting the money right now. She hung up and marched over to me. My brother needs $2,000 by tomorrow or he's getting evicted. I need you to transfer it from our savings right now while I'm watching, so I know it's done. She stood there with her phone out, waiting. I just kept working on the engine. Dave, I'm not playing around. Transfer the money! I straightened up, slowly, grabbed a rag, and while wiping the grease off my hands, I looked her in the eye and said, your family problems aren't my problems. She paused, processed what I just said, and then started screaming. Are you seriously being this petty? My brother is about to be homeless, and you're, what, trying to make some point? She shoved her phone in my face. Just do it now! I pushed her phone away gently. No, I Won't your brother your problem? Her face went from annoyed to furious in seconds. This is our money. I work, too. Transfer it right now or I swear to God, Dave. Or what? You'll ignore me like you did when my mother died? Oh, wait, that already happened. She actually raised her hand like she was going to slap me, then stopped herself. She stood there for another 10 seconds, then said through gritted teeth, you're

I was 18 when my Aunt Carla invited me and my friend Beth to her ranch house for 4th of July. Now this place was huge. Four bedrooms with queen beds, a master bedroom and this massive kids room with about 6 beds and a loft. I was pumped to finally get away from the city and run around on their land with Beth. We got there, I found out the sleeping situation. Me and Beth were supposed to bunk with four screaming kids while their parents got their own room. My cousin Ryan, who's 16 also got his own space with our other relatives. But I us, nope. We got babysitting duty. The kids belong to my Aunt Julie and Uncle Mark. These people had four kids under 5 and none of them slept through the night. I knew this because I'd stayed at their house once before and it was pure hell. The baby would cry, wake up the twins who would then wake up the four year old and it was just chaos all night long. I told Aunt Carla we'd rather sleep on the couch. That's when things got ugly. Aunt Julie completely lost it. She started screaming about how we got to bring a friend so we should watch her kids. She said someone needed to be responsible for them during the night. And since Ryan was a growing boy who doesn't know how to take care of kids. It had to be us. The way she said it, like we were hired help or something, made my blood boil. Nobody else wanted to get involved. Aunt Carla just shrugged and said we needed to figure it out ourselves. So I ignored Julie and started setting up blankets on the couch with Beth. That's when Julie really snapped. He marched over and threw all our stuff off the couches onto the floor. She got right in my face and said we had to sleep with her kids or we couldn't stay at all. Beth was standing there looking mortified because this crazy woman was screaming at us over sleeping arrangements. I told Julie we were leaving if we couldn't sleep on the couch. She, I started screaming even louder about how I drove up with my dad's boat and if I left, nobody could pull it around the property, like that was somehow my problem. The whole family just stood there watching this woman have a complete meltdown over us not wanting to be unpaid babysitters. My cousin Ryan was smirking like this was entertainment. Aunt Carla kept saying, just work it out instead of telling her sister to calm down. I'd had enough. I went outside and started loading our stuff back into my truck. Julie followed me out there, still yelling about how I was being selfish and that she needed a break. From her kids. She actually said I should be grateful for the chance to help family. Beth was standing by the truck looking like she wanted to disappear. This wasn't exactly the fun weekend getaway I'd promised her. I could see other relatives peeking out the windows watching the drama unfold. I hitched the boat trailer back up while Julie kept ranting. I was going on about how young people today don't respect their elders and how I was setting a bad example. Then she tried a different approach and started crying about how overwhelmed she was with four kids and how she just needed one night of good sleep. I almost felt bad for a second until I remembered she'd thrown our stuff on the floor and screamed at my friend. I told her that.

Now that they've warmed up to me. So I'm 42, dating Tim, who's 59. Guys, broke as hell. But I've got money from a trust fund. His daughters thought I was some gold digger trying to steal their dad's cash. Plot twist, dude literally has no money. Tim's wife died of cancer like three times she got it. This man emptied everything. Credit cards maxed out, second mortgage, retirement, gone. Everything just to keep her alive long enough to see both daughters get married. The house was underwater on payments and he was looking at bankruptcy when he moved in with me. His daughter Butters live six hours away. We drove there for Christmas two years in a row and these girls treated me like absolute garbage. They pulled him away whenever he tried to include me in conversations. Her husbands couldn't even say hi to me because the daughters would literally talk over me every time they tried. First year, Tim told them off and they gave this fake apology, said seeing dad with someone who wasn't mom was too painful. Fine, whatever. Second year, they did the exact same thing. I was done. This year, I told him he could go see his daughters, but I wasn't dealing with that crap again. He wasn't thrilled because I usually help with the driving when his back starts acting up. His 2,010 piece of junk car was falling apart anyway, so I leased Him a nice luxury car through my brother's dealership. Tim calls the girls all excited about the new car, thinking he can visit more often without his back killing him. Big mistake. They absolutely lost it. Started screaming about how he was spending their dead mother's money on some house and fancy car to impress his bimbo bartender girlfriend. Said he never offered them money for their weddings. That's when everything came out. These girls had no clue about the debt. They thought there was some massive life insurance payout sitting around. They didn't know about the maxed credit cards or that the house was about to get foreclosed on. They had no idea Tim was basically homeless until he moved into my place. I also didn't realize it was my house he was living in. Dude pays the water Bill because he takes forever showers and splits groceries. That's it. Now suddenly these girls want my phone number. They're sorry I felt lonely at Christmas. How sweet. They want to visit us next summer, too. Funny how that works out since I live near the beach.

Yeah, I said, looking up from my phone where I've been scrolling TikTok for the past hour. Dad's face went from worried to absolutely terrified in half a second. Like I just told him I jumped off a roof. How many? How many did you take? His voice cracked and he grabbed my shoulders hard enough to hurt. Two. I had a headache from studying. He actually stumbled backward and had to grab my desk to keep from falling. Oh, god, no, no, no! He was pacing now, running his hands through his hair so violently, I thought he'd rip it out. When. When did you take them? Like an hour ago. Dad, what's wrong? You're scaring me. He stopped dead and his face went even wider. I took one, too, 20 minutes ago. I thought they were Tylenol. He sat on my bed and put his head in his hands, and that's when my stomach dropped. Because dad never panics. Not even when our house almost burned down last year. We need to tell your mother. Oh, god, she's going to kill me. He looked at me with genuine fear in his eyes. You feel anything? Dizzy? Hot? Is your heart racing? I wasn't before, but now my heart was pounding from pure terror. Mom came running when dad yelled for her, and I've never seen someone's expression change so fast. Confused. To furious to absolutely horrified in about two seconds. You left them where she could find them? She was screaming now, actually screaming. Are you insane? She rushed over, checking my pulse with shaking hands, looking at my pupils, feeling my forehead. Baby, how do you feel? Any nausea, chest pain, trouble breathing? Before I could answer, my older brother Matt walked in, looking annoyed until he saw mom basically giving me a medical exam while dad sat there looking like he might puke. What's happening? Matt asked, but mom was already on the phone with someone nearly crying. Yes, my 15 year old daughter. She took two of them about an hour ago. No, my husband took one, too. Dad kept checking his own pulse and muttering about contraindications and drug interactions.

I've been clean for six months. When I saw Domingo's name on the lease agreement, my stomach dropped. The property management company secretary smiled at me. Mister Vega is one of our best landlords. Never had a complaint. I stared at the signature line, hand trembling. Of all the apartment complexes in Tucson, I picked the one owned by my former dealer. Is there a problem? She asked. I forced myself to sign. I needed this place. My recovery housing was kicking me out, and everywhere else required credit checks. I'd fail moving day. I kept my head down, praying I wouldn't see him. But there he was, fixing a broken gate in the courtyard. Domingo looked different. Clean cut, polo shirt, tool belt. Nothing like the strung out dealer who used to run three trap houses. He glanced up and recognition flashed across his face. Alejandro, he said quietly. Not my real name, but the one I'd used buying from him. It's Paul now, I said. Paul Morrison. He nodded slowly. I go by Domingo Vega these days. Not Dom, not D money. Just Domingo. We stood there awkwardly until he spoke. Apartment 2:37, right. Air conditioner works, but the disposal's touchy. Don't put pasta down it. Normal landlord talk. Except we both knew the last time we'd seen each other. I've been begging for a front, promising I was good for it. He laughed and told me to come. Back with ash or collateral. That was the night I overdosed in a Walgreens bathroom. Waking up in the hospital was my rock bottom. For three weeks, we avoided each other. Then my kitchen flooded. I had no choice but to call maintenance. Domingo showed up himself with tools and a shop vacuum. As he worked, he said, I got clean four years ago. Lost my connect, got arrested and went through withdrawal in county. Best thing that ever happened to me. I watched him expertly fixing my pipes. You? He asked. Six months. I said, seven. Tomorrow. Actually, he smiled. The first year is hell. Second year is harder. Third year, you stop counting days. How'd you go from dealing to this? I asked. Flamingo dried his hands on a rag. My grandmother left me money, but it was in a trust. Couldn't touch it while I was using. Got clean, got the money, bought this place. As a reminder, he gestured around. Half these tenants are in recovery. I don't advertise it, but word gets around. I look at him differently. You're running sober housing? Nah, he said. Just a landlord who gets it. No judgment, but no enabling either. A month later, I relapsed. Not meth, but alcohol, which for me always LED back to meth. Domingo found me passed out in the laundry room at 3:00am. Bottle of vodka smashed on the floor. I expected fiction. Instead, he helped me to my apartment and sat with Me. While I cried. I'm gonna lose everything again. I sobbed. Maybe, he said. Or maybe this is just a stumble. Your choice. He left his number. Call me instead of your dealer. I'll tell you all the reasons it's not worth it. I did call him. Two nights later, when the cravings hit hard. He talked me through it, sharing his own stories of almost relapsing. You know what saved me, he said. Remembering the faces of people I sold to. Kids like you wasting away, begging for another hit. I carry that guilt every day. His voice cracked. I can't undo what I did, but I can make sure my buildings are safe places for people trying to get better. Three months passed. I stayed clean. Got a job at a warehouse, started therapy. One evening, flamingo knock on my door. Need to ask you something. Said. He explained that another tenant, a young woman named Carla, was struggling, fresh out of rehab, no support system. Would you consider being her recovery buddy? Just someone to check in with? I wanted to say no, that I was barely keeping myself together, but I remembered him sitting with me that night. Yeah, I said. I can do that. Carla and I became friends. We went to meetings together, cooked meals, watch movies. Having someone else to focus on helped me stay accountable. When she celebrated six months clean, the domino threw a small party in the courtyard. Nothing fancy. Just cake and coffee. But five other tenants showed up. Turns out we were all in recovery. All placed here by Domingo's quiet network of helping without advertising it. One day, while paying rent, I finally asked him directly. Do you ever regret what you did before? Domingo looked out his office window at the courtyard where Carla was teaching another tenant to garden. Every day, I sold to maybe 300 people over two years. Eleven of them died. I know their names. He pulled out a worn notebook. Pages filled with names and dates. I keep track of everyone I hurt and everyone living here who's getting better. That's my apology to them. Last week marked my 2 years clean. Domingo reduced my rent without me asking. Said it was a long term tenant discount. We both knew what it really was. Recognition that I made it through the hardest part. Yesterday, a new tenant moved in, shaky and thin, clearly fresh from detox. Domingo introduced us. Paul here knows the neighborhood. He can show you around. The kid looked scared but grateful. After Domingo left, he asked me, is the landlord cool? Someone said he used to be in the game. I thought about how to answer. He was. Now he's something else. Someone who understands exactly what you're going through and won't judge you for it. The kid nodded, looking relieved. As I helped him carry boxes up the stairs, I realized Domingo had

My parents actually looked at a Newborn baby and thought, let's spell crystal like we're trying to unlock a cheat code. For 18 years I dealt with this disaster of a name that looked like someone sneezed while typing. Every first day of school was the same. I'm nightmare. Teachers would get to my name on the roll call and just stop. Dead silence. Then they'd attempt some butchered pronunciation like kirstyle or questilly. I'd have to raise my hand and say, it's just crystal, but spelled like my parents hate me. The worst part wasn't even the pronunciation, it was the assumptions. People would see my name written down and immediately think I was some exotic foreign exchange student or that my family was super religious. I got asked if I was Muslim at least once a week. Random people would come up to me asking what country I was from or what language my name came from. I'd have to explain that. No, my parents just thought they were being creative when they were really just being cruel. My mom was the worst about it. She'd email every single teacher at the beginning of each school year with the whole paragraph about how to pronounce my name correctly and the cultural significance behind the spelling. There was no cultural significance. She just saw the name Crystal in a baby book and decided to make it look fancy. When I was 15, I started telling people to just save my name as Crystal in their phones. It made everything easier. But my mom found out when she saw a text from my friend Jess that just said Crystal, and she completely lost it. She grounded me for two weeks and made me write apology letters to all my friends explaining the proper way to spell my name. That's when I knew I was changing it. The second I turned 18, the day after my birthday, I marched down to the courthouse with all my paperwork. The clerk was super nice about it. She

Last Tuesday, I was making lunch for my kids when my phone rang. Unknown number, but I picked up anyway. Big mistake, right? This guy with a thick accent starts telling me he's from the IRS and I owe $4,200 in back taxes. Says if I don't pay immediately with gift cards, the police will arrest me within an hour. Now, here's the thing. I literally just got my tax refund two weeks ago. My accountant, Beth, handled everything perfectly and I even got money back. So I knew this dude was full of it. But instead of hanging up, something clicked in my brain. My neighbour, Missus Kim, had fallen for this exact scam last month and lost $800. Time for payback. I started crying into the phone. Oh, no, I can't go to jail. My kids need me. The scammer ate it up. He told me to go to target and buy iTunes gift cards worth $2,000 as a first payment. I said I needed an hour to get the money together. First I called my cousin Jake, who's a cop, told him what was happening, and he said to keep the guy on the line as long as possible. Then I started my revenge tour. I called the scammer back an hour later, sobbing. I'm at target, but I'm so confused. Which gift cards do I buy? He walked me through it step by step. I pretended to be this helpless Single mom who didn't understand technology. Sorry, can you repeat that? My hands are shaking so bad. For the next 20 minutes I wandered around target asking him questions. Do I need the physical cards or the digital ones? The cashier is asking for I D. Is that normal? Sorry, my 4 year old is having a meltdown in the cart. Finally I told him I had the cards. He was so excited. Probably thinking about his commission. I read him the first number. Okay, it starts with 5. Wait, is that a 5 or an S? The scratching messed it up. I gave him completely fake numbers, mixing up digits, going super slow. After 20 minutes of this, he got frustrated. Ma'am, those numbers don't work. Go buy new cards. So I did the whole routine again. Drove to Walmart, called him back crying harder. The first store's cards didn't work. Are you sure you're really from the IRS? This time I really went for it. I'm in the Walmart parking lot fake crying so loud. Other shoppers were staring. My kids are asking why mommy is buying $5,000 worth of iTunes cards. My daughter wants to know if we're going to be homeless. The scammer actually tried to comfort me. Don't worry, ma'am, just read me the numbers and everything will be fine. I fed him another set of fake numbers, this time adding sorry, my baby spilled juice on the card. Let me clean it off. Three Hours in, this guy had wasted his entire afternoon on me. I could hear other scammers in the background getting impatient. Supervisor was probably wondering why he hadn't closed the deal yet. That's when I went for the kill shot. You know what's funny? I just got off the phone with my cousin Jake. He's the police officer standing right next to me. And he says you're not from the IRS at all. Dead silence. Then what? Yeah, Jake says the IRS doesn't take gift card payments and he's got all your phone records now. Something about tracing the call. He wants to know if you'd like to chat with him directly. The line went dead so fast I thought my phone broke. But here's where it gets good. I posted the whole story on Facebook with screenshots of the call log. My neighbour started sharing it, then my kids school shared it. Then somehow the local news picked it up. They interviewed me about scammer tactics and how to protect yourself. Three weeks later, our neighbourhood association voted me Community Hero of the month for wasting a scammer's time and protecting other families. They gave me a fifty dollar gift card to the grocery store, which was way better than losing thousands to some creep.

What's the scariest hallucination you've ever had? When I was 17, I started hearing whispers, just little ones at first, like when you're falling asleep and think someone called your name. My mom said it was stress from school and I believed her because the voices only came when I was freaking out about tests or whatever. But by the time I turned 19, the whispers got clearer. They weren't random anymore. They told me things that were going to happen. The first real prediction was about my coworker Jake spilling coffee on his white shirt at exactly 9:47 in the morning. I thought I was losing it, but I kept checking the clock anyway. At 9:47 on the dot, Jake knocked over his mug all over himself. My hands started shaking. How could my brain know that? The voice came back two days later. This time it said there would be a three car crash at the intersection near my apartment. Don't walk that way. After work, I took a different route home and sure enough, the evening news showed twisted metal and ambulances at that exact spot. I started calling them the forecasters. They felt like guardian angels or something keeping me safe. The predictions kept coming and they were always right. My girlfriend would text me five minutes after they told me she would, my bus would be late by exactly 12 minutes, like they said. I stopped questioning it, started trusting these voices like they Were gods. But then the predictions got darker. They told me not to visit my brother's graduation party because someone would get hurt. I stayed home and found out later that two guys got in a fight and one ended up in the hospital with a broken nose. They warned me that my girlfriend was cheating. I didn't want to believe it, but I checked her phone and found the messages. Everything they said was true. The forecasters had never been wrong, not once. So when the voice told me I was going to get shot that Tuesday, I completely lost it. They said the bullet was coming and there was nothing I could do to stop it, just prepare. I called in sick to work, locked every door and window in my apartment. I even moved my dresser in front of the front door. I sat in my bathroom with a knife listening for footsteps in the hallway. The voice kept repeating, the bullet is coming, the bullet is coming. I stayed awake for 23 hours straight, jumping at every sound.

My daughter Elia destroyed our neighbour's face with a baseball bat. I was in the middle of a work meeting when my phone lit up with a call from my neighbour Roman. His voice was shaking with fury. Your daughter Elia is psychotic. She attacked me with a baseball bat. I was just checking on her like you asked and she broke my effing nose! The cops are already here. My blood ran cold. Elia was a straight A student and had never been in a fight in her life. I ran to my car and started driving. The 20 minute drive home felt like hours, my mind racing through every possible scenario. Roman's words kept echoing in my head. Psychotic act. Broke my nose. What could have possibly happened? By the time I reached our driveway, my shirt was soaked with sweat. The scene that greeted me was even worse than I'd imagined. Two police cruisers were parked outside with their lights flashing and half the neighborhood had gathered on their lawns to stare. Roman was on our front porch and was holding a towel to what was clearly a broken nose. His white polo shirt was stained red and he was gesturing wildly at two officers who were taking notes. She. He needs to be locked up! He was shouting. This is assault with a deadly weapon! I want charges pressed! Elia sat on our front lawn with her knees Pulled to her chest, staring at the grass. She looked so small, so defeated. The female officer approached me as I got out of the car. Sir, your neighbor claims your daughter attacked him unprovoked with a baseball bat. If he presses charges, we're looking at aggravated assault. That could mean juvenile detention. My stomach dropped. Roman saw me and immediately started ranting. She's violent, unhinged. I was just checking on her like you asked, making sure she got home safe from school, and she came at me like a wild animal. Look at my face. My nose is broken. I might need surgery. The male officer showed me photos they'd taken of Roman's injuries. His nose was def. Broken, already starting to bruise. Your daughter hasn't said a word since we arrived, the officer said quietly. We need to know what happened here. I walked past Roman, ignoring his continued shouting about pressing charges and teaching violent children a lesson. Then I knelt down beside Elia on the grass, and I put my hand on her shoulder. She flinched, but didn't look up. Elia, Sweetheart, I need you to tell me exactly what happened. Every detail. She finally raised her head, and I saw her eyes were red from crying. But there was something else there, too. Anger. Maybe even disgust. I was in my room, she said, her voice barely a whisper.

And as soon as medical professionals saw her, they knew that she had experienced severe abuse. Her toenails were missing, her entire body was covered in bruises. She had two black eyes. She was also severely malnourished. And then several days later, she lost her life. And as if it could get any more upsetting. Her school alleges that they called CPS 12 times to help her and her two siblings and nothing was done over years. The police are alleging that her father, Richard Batista, and his girlfriend Annika Woods, physically abused Rebecca and SA Rebecca. They also believe that the two other children in the home were also treated badly. On July 27th, Annika makes a 9 1 1 phone call where she says that Rebecca is unresponsive. There is no sense of urgency in her voice, in my opinion. She tells the dispatcher that Rebecca was unresponsive, that she had ran away and a neighbor found her. This call drops multiple times while the dispatcher is trying to get Annika to to give Rebecca CPR. Annika claims she was giving Rebecca breaths, but just hesitated to lay her flat on the ground and do CPR on her. Once she was in the hospital, the doctors described it as torture. That is the word they used. This all LED to the couple being arrested. Apparently this is where they were living. And so not only are They being charged with Rebecca's death, but they're being charged with hurting the other two kids. In a police interview, Annika allegedly said that she did hit the kids. Now, CPS has responded to the allegation that the school called 12 times to report what was going on. CPS said, we only have five calls in our record. You only called us five times. Like that is any better. They said there's a criteria you have to meet before you can go and investigate. And so nothing was ever done and this beautiful ten year old child lost her life after experiencing who knows how long of pure torture. And I don't know if she truly ran away and was found unresponsive or if that was just what they claimed. But I wouldn't blame her for running away because no one else was able to help her. I will keep you guys updated on what happens with this one and what happens to these two things.
