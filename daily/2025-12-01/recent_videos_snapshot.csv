This is my roommate, Jenny Rioselle. Her period's been really bad and she hasn't left our dorm room in two days. I went to go check on her after my intro to Econ class this morning and she was burning up. I called my dad who's a doctor, well, he's a dermatologist, but he knows the basic stuff. And he said that I should call Campus Health, but Jenny kept saying no, and she was fine and she wouldn't let me call. You did the right thing bringing her in. We're gonna help you into the bed. Okay, Jenny, here, let me give you my number. I'll get it from you, Amy. Let's give the doctor some room temps 1, 0, 2.3. She's tachycardic. Heart rates 1, 43, b p, 80 over 45. I'm gonna palpate your abdomen, Jenny. Let me know if anything feels tender. Her uterus is enlarged. Ultrasound. Let's give 4 of morphine and hang a litre of saline. Her endometrial lining is thickened and I'm seeing pockets that could be air endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease. Let's order a sepsis panel and an H C G test. In the meantime, start Zoxen, I, V and loop in. Doctor Asher. She definitely has endometritis, high white count, elevated procalcitonin and lactate and her roommate said she's having a bad period. Mm. But her pregnancy test is positive and I didn't see an embryo on her ultrasound. Yeah, I heard the chorionic lining is likely From retained product. She's having a miscarriage. Am I in trouble? We just, we wanna get you feeling better. Okay. The reason you're sick is because your uterus has retained parts of your placenta which has become infected. You will need surgery to remove this. Do I need surgery? Yes, but it is a minor and very safe procedure. In the meantime, I would like to collect vaginal cultures so we can pinpoint the bacteria that's causing your infection. Is that okay with you? Okay. Doctor Asher, are you ready for the swab? Um, yes. Sorry. I just. Culture swab, please. Okay. Okay. I will be right back. Wait, wait. Where are you going? It's okay. I'll be right back, I promise. Jenny's pelvic exam revealed a second degree perineal tear. And I saw umbilical cord coming from her cervix. I felt like something was off with her demeanour, but I wasn't sure if she was in shock or hiding something. Do you know how far along she was? Based on the size of the tear in the cord, I suspect close to full term. So where's the baby now?

My dad stepped forward in the restaurant. Linda, this is inappropriate. Linda set her napkin down slowly. What's inappropriate is pretending my niece doesn't exist because your son can't keep his hands off other people's fiance's. My brother Wesley started toward the door. I'm not staying for this. Good, Linda said, because I'm changing my will next week, and I wanted her here when I told you. The entire restaurant went quiet. The hostess just stood there holding four menus. My mom grabbed my dad's arm. Linda, you can't be serious. I've never been more serious. Sit down or leave. But she stays. They sat. Of course they did. Linda owned three commercial properties downtown and a beach house in Destin. She'd never married, never had kids. My parents had been positioning Wesley as her favorite nephew for years. Linda pulled out an envelope and slid it across the table to me. I already changed it, she said last month. My lawyer has the documents. Everything goes to you. The properties, the accounts, the house. Wesley's face went white. Aunt Linda, I don't understand. I've been visiting you every month. I drove you to your appointments, I. You drove me because your mother told you to. Linda cut him off. You visited because you wanted my money. You never once asked how I was actually feeling. Not once she turned to me. But you. You called me every Sunday for three years, even when your own mother wouldn't speak to you. You flew out when I had my hip surgery and slept on my couch for a week. You sent me flowers on my birthday when these people couldn't even remember the date. My mom stood up. This is manipulation. You're dying, and you're not thinking clearly. We'll contest this. Linda smiled. I hoped you'd say that. My lawyer is also here tonight, two tables behind you. He's been documenting everything. A man in a gray suit raised his wine glass slightly. Wesley knocked his chair over, leaving. My parents followed, my mother already crying. Linda reached across the table and squeezed my hand. Happy birthday to me, she said. We ordered dessert. She had eight months left. I made sure she spent every single one of them loved.

When I asked where she Learned that, she whispered. It's how mom decides who has to sleep outside. My seven year old sister Maya has 12 dolls arranged in a perfect row on her bedroom floor. She's holding a clipboard asking each one questions in this serious voice. Do you have references? Can you work weekends? I laugh. What are you playing? She doesn't look up interviewing them like Mommy does some. Something about her tone makes me uneasy. Mom interviews dolls, not dolls. Maya points to her closet. The people. My stomach drops. What people? She walks to her closet, opens it. There's a door I've never noticed before or behind our house, Maya explains. When they don't answer right, they have to sleep in the shed. I'm frozen. We don't have a shed. Show me. We go downstairs. Mom's at the grocery store. Dad's at work. Maya leads me to the back door, points through the window. There's a small structure behind our fence I always thought was abandoned from the previous owner. Through the dusty window, I see blankets, pillows, a space heater, food wrappers, a bucket in the corner. Mom brings them water on Tuesdays, Maya says. The nice ones get to come inside sometimes to clean my phone. I need my phone. But Maya grabs my hand. Don't tell Mommy I showed you, she said. It's our special secret. The people who tell get Sent away forever. I crouch down. Maya, has mom ever hurt you? She shakes her head. Only the people who don't work good enough work. My brain clicks. How many people his mom brought here? Maya counts on her fingers. Rosa was first, then Miguel, then the quiet lady. Now it's just Carmen and the man with the cross necklace. Five people. My mother has kept five people in our backyard. Where did Rosa go? Maya's face goes sad. She got too sick. Mom said she had to leave in the middle of the night. I feel like I'm going to throw up. When was this before my birthday? January. January. That's when mom started her consulting business from home, when she suddenly had money for Maya's private school. For my college fund, for the kitchen renovation. I grabbed Maya's shoulders. Where's Carmen right now? In there. The man, too. Mom locks it when she goes shopping so they don't leave before she pays them. Locks them. Maya, does dad know? She nods. Daddy.

Last month I went back to the house while you were at work. I had to know if that room was still there. My heart was pounding. The door was unlocked. This time I went down the stairs, the room was exactly the same, except now there were new photos, recent photo of you as an adult. And the writing on the wall had changed. It said, Day 9, 1:25. He is ready. Collection begins soon. 9,025 days. I calculated that was exactly my current age in days. I tried to destroy the room. I ripped the photos off the walls. I tried to scrub away the symbols. But when I turned to leave, the door was closed and I heard the voices. They said, you interfered, now you pay the price. The letter ended there, just stopped mid sentence. I immediately drove to my childhood home. My parents had moved out years ago and the house had been empty ever since. I had a key. I went straight to the basement to the locked door. It was open, just slight. I pushed it open and saw the staircase going down. I counted as I descended, 47 steps, just like Emma said. At the bottom was the room. The symbols were still on the walls. The circle was still on the floor, but the photos were gone, except for one. In the center of the circle was a photo of me taken today. I was getting into my car outside Emma's funeral. I hadn't seen anyone take that photo. Written below it, Day 9, 1:25, collection complete, transfer initiated. I heard footsteps on the stairs behind me, slow and heavy, coming down. I turned to run, but the door at the top slammed shut. The voices started, hundreds of them, all around me coming from the walls. They were saying my name over and over. And then I heard Emma's voice clear and distinct. I'm sorry. I tried to protect you, but now I understand the voices weren't trying to take you. They were trying to warn you. Someone in our family made a deal and you're the payment. You always were. I looked at the walls. The symbol started glowing faint red light. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. The footsteps reached the bottom of the Stairs, I turned around and saw who was standing there. It was my father, but his eyes were completely black and he was smiling. He said, I've been waiting 32 years for this. The deal is finally complete. He reached for me, and the last thing I heard was Emma's voice whispering, I'm so sorry. I couldn't say.

I now know the disgusting reason why. When I was 7 years old, my older sister, Emma, started sneaking into my room every night. She'd wait until I was asleep, then she'd press her hands over my ears and hold them there for hours. I'd wake up sometimes and ask what she was doing. She'd always say the same thing, I'm protecting you. Go back to sleep. I never understood what she meant, but every morning she'd be gone and my ears would ache. This went on for three years, every single night from age 7 to 10. And suddenly it stopped. Emma moved away to college and I never saw her do it again. I'm 32 now. Emma died last week in a car accident. At the funeral, my aunt pulled me aside and said, your sister asked me to give you this if anything happened to her. She handed me a sealed envelope. Inside was a letter in Emma's handwriting. If you're reading this, I'm gone. And now you need to know the truth about why I covered your ears all those years. I wasn't protecting you from something outside. I was protecting you from something inside our house, something that only came out at night. My hands started shaking. I kept reading, when you were 7, I started hearing voices at night, not from outside, from the walls, from the floor, from the ceiling. They were whispering hundreds Of voices all talking at once. I couldn't understand what they were saying, but I knew they were talking about you. I, Emma had never mentioned hearing voices. I went to mom and dad, but they said I was dreaming. They said I was making it up for attention. But I knew what I heard. And the voices got louder every night. They were saying your name over and over, like they were calling you. The letter continued. One night I followed the voices. They LED me to the basement, to the door that's always locked, the door dad told us never to open. I found the key in his desk and I opened it. I remembered that door. It was in the corner of the basement behind some old boxes. I'd asked my parents about it when I was a kid, but I said it was just story. Behind the door was a staircase going down, way down. I counted 47 steps before I reached the bottom. And what I found there made me understand why the voices wanted you. I stopped reading. I didn't want to know, but I forced myself to continue. There was a room, a big room with symbols painted on the walls. And in the center was a circle drawn in something dark, something that looked like dried blood. Inside the circle were photos, dozens of them, all of you from the day you were born until that week. Someone had been taking photos. Of you your entire life. My stomach turned. I kept reading. I looked closer and saw writing under the photos, dates. And next to each date was a number. I didn't understand what they meant until I saw the last photo. It was from that morning. And next to it was written day 2, 5:57. Final phase begins tonight, 20, 500, 57 days. I did the math. That would have been right around the time I turned 7. I ran upstairs and that's when I realized what the voices were doing. They were trying to call you down.

When did you realise you were living in a bubble and not like everyone else? I thought every kid had their birthdays planned by event coordinators. Until I was 13, every April, my parents would rent out country clubs or these fancy rooftop venues downtown. They'd hire magicians, ice cream trucks, face painters, and once even this guy who brought parrots that could talk. I'm talking like 60 kids from school showing up, tables covered in those fancy cloth things, waiters walking around with little appetizers on trays. But here's the weird part. None of the kids ever stayed long. Like they'd show up, eat some cake, watch the magic show for maybe an hour, then their parents would collect them and they'd leave. And nobody ever brought me actual presents, just these white envelopes that my mom would grab and stuff into her purse before I could even see what was inside. I didn't think it was strange back then. I figured that's just how birthdays worked. The envelopes probably had money or gift cards or something, right? And maybe other kids just had smaller parties because their parents weren't as organised as mine. Then in 7th grade, this kid, Jake, from my math class, invited me to his birthday party. I was actually pretty excited because Jake was cool and I wanted to be friends with him. My mom dropped me off at this public park and I was confused because there was No ballet or anything, just regular parking spots. When I found Jake's party, my brain basically short circuited. There was one folding table with a plastic tablecloth, hot dogs cooking on this little portable grill and a cooler full of sodas. No servers, no fancy decorations, just balloons tied to the table legs. And get this, there was one soccer ball. That was it for entertainment. But all the kids were laughing their heads off. They were playing tag, kicking the soccer ball around and having these intense conversations about video games and t V shows. Everyone had wrapped presents, actual gifts and colourful paper with ribbons and stuff. Jake opened each one and got genuinely excited about things like Pokemon cards and a new skateboard. The party lasted four hours. Four hours. And nobody wanted to leave. Parents had to literally drag their kids away because it was.

What rumor? I looked up confused and reached for my phone but remembered it had died on the bus that morning. The entire classroom went silent. Kids who were talking suddenly stopped mid sentence. Everyone was stealing glances at me, but whenever I made eye contact, they'd quickly look away. This one girl, Arlene, in the front row, was actually crying while looking at me. But for some reason the boys were laughing. Miss I O Connor shifted uncomfortably and adjusted her glasses. I'm not at liberty to discuss the rumor with you. I really suggest you speak with the counselor. My heart started racing because something was seriously wrong. Whatever this rumor was, it had made my teacher look at me like I was made of glass about to break. I grabbed my dead phone and my backpack and headed for the door. I needed to find my best friend, Kaylee right now. Kaylee was in Mister Brady's homeroom down the hall. I knocked and pointed at her through the little window. Mister Brady looked at me with the same wide eyed sad expression Miss O'connor had and immediately let Kaylee come out. That's when I knew this was bad. Teachers never just let kids leave class without a hall pass. The second we got into the hallway, Kaylee grabbed me in the tightest hug. I'm so sorry this is happening to you, baby. I'm so, so sorry. I started crying without even knowing why my best friend was holding me like my life was ruined. All I could think about was if someone leaked me. Kaylee just kept hugging me and rubbing my back while I saw.

We want you gone tonight. When I agreed and stopped paying for everything, they, you've been controlling us long enough, my mother announced over dinner, her words slightly slurred from her third glass of wine. Dad nodded beside her, his bloodshot eyes avoiding mine entirely. My little sister, Yarabelle, stopped eating immediately. At 11, she'd gotten used to their erratic behavior, but this was different. Controlling you. I kept my voice level, though my stomach dropped. Don't play innocent, dad finally spoke. I recognized this pattern. They needed money again. We know you've been intercepting our paychecks, hiding our bank cards, treating us like children who can't manage their own money. The accusation was so backwards, I almost laughed. I've been cashing their occasional checks and using every penny for rent and groceries before they could gamble it away. My warehouse job barely covered the rest, but somehow I'd managed to keep us housed and Yarabelle fed. You monitor every dollar we spend, mom continued, gaining confidence. We're grown adults, but you act like our parent, deciding what we can and can't buy. We're done being controlled by our own son. You're 22, Dad added, want you gone. By morning, Yarabelle's eyes went wide and she grabbed my arm under the table. Unless, dad added, you give us access to your bank accounts for the emotional damage you caused. They wanted my savings, the emergency fund I'd scraped together for Yarabelle. And me, I made my choice. I'll be gone by morning, I said quietly. I packed that night while they celebrated downstairs, popping open a bottle of champagne they've been saving for a special occasion. Yarabell helped me carry boxes to my car. Tears streaming down her face. I slipped her a cheap phone I bought weeks ago, telling her to hide it and only use it for emergencies. You're coming back, right, she whispered. I couldn't answer that honestly, so I just hugged her tight. The next morning, they were already making plans. My friend's couch. I watched their social media explode with excitement. Finally free to live our lives, mom posted, along with a selfie of them holding plane tickets. Day 1 in Vegas, they posted everything. The welcome drinks at the casino, the fancy steakhouse dinner, dad throwing dice at the craps table. Beginner's luck, he captioned a photo of a small pile of chips. Day 2 brought more victories. Mom hit three cherries on the slots. Dad posted a video from a poker table, stacks of chips growing in front of him. Should have done this years ago, he wrote. Their friends commented with congratulations and fire emojis. Yarabell texted me that night. They said three days back, Sunday. By day 4, the posts got bigger. VIP room access, bottle service at some club. A photo of them in matching silk robes at the hotel spa. Living like we deserve, mom captioned it. They'd extended their Stay hot street continues. Day 5, 6, 7, the posts kept coming. Expensive shows, helicopter tours, more casino floors. Yarabelle's texts changed. Running low on food. When are they coming back? Day 8 was quieter, just one photo of a poker table, no caption. Day 9, nothing. Day 10, Yarabelle called me crying there.

Fine, I'll eat something normal. So my roommate Jake has this thing where he gets all pissy about me eating at night. Like, dude, I work 10 hour shifts at the warehouse and don't get home until 11 most nights. Sorry if my grilled cheese and leftover pizza bothers your precious sleep schedule. Last Tuesday I got home around my usual time, starving because I skipped lunch to cover for this guy who called out sick. I was exhausted, feet killing me. Just wanted to make something quick and pass out. I opened the fridge and saw we had some leftover Chinese takeout from the weekend, so I figured I'd heat that up. But as I'm pulling containers out comes stomping out of his room in his stupid Batman pajama pants all dramatic like I just murdered someone. He goes, really? You're gonna be loud in the kitchen again? Some of us have real jobs that start early. Real jobs? This dude works at a bank and strolls in at 9:30. I've been up since 5:00am loading trucks. I told him I was just heating up some lo Mein, would take like two minutes. He rolled his eyes and said why can't you eat normal food at normal times like a normal person? All this weird late night stuff is ridiculous. Weird late night stuff? It was leftover Chinese food. Not exactly strange, but fine. He wants normal food at Normal times. I can do normal. The next morning I woke up at 4:30 instead of my usual 5:15. Went straight to the kitchen and started making breakfast. Real breakfast. Bacon, eggs, hash Browns, toast. The works. Used every pan we owned. Really let that bacon sizzle nice and loud. Jake's room shares a wall with the kitchen. Around 5 a. M. I heard his alarm go off. Then I heard it go off again. And again. Dude kept hitting snooze while I'm out here clanging pans around flipping hash Browns. You know, making normal breakfast food at a normal breakfast time. By the third news alarm, I was really getting into it. Started humming while I cooked. Dropped a few pans on accident. Had to check on those hash Browns every 30 seconds to make sure they weren't burning. Finally heard him get up around 5:30. He stumbled out looking like he got hit by a truck, hair sticking up everywhere, squinting at me like I was some kind of alien. What the hell are you doing? I smiled real big and said, making normal food at a normal time. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, right? He just stood there for a minute trying to process what was happening. I could see his brain working trying to figure out if he could complain about me cooking breakfast

I was hurt, but honestly, I was more angry that she didn't just tell me the truth. I focused on work, picked up extra shifts, started saving money for a house. My boss offered me a supervisor position with a big raise. I took a welding certification course on weekends to specialize in underwater welding, which pays even more. Three months after the breakup, I bought a 4 closed house in a nice neighborhood. It needed work, but I could fix most of it myself. New floors, updated kitchen, completely redid the master bathroom. I posted progress pictures on my Instagram because I was proud of the work. That's when Jessica started watching all my stories. She started liking my posts. Then she sent me a message saying the house looked amazing and asking how I was doing. I left her on read. A week later, she texted saying she made a huge mistake. The Derek turned out to be a jerk who only cared about himself. He dumped her at parties to network with his finance buddies, made her split every Bill down to the penny, even asked her to help pay for his car payment because he was bad with money. Despite the fancy job, Jessica said her friends were wrong about me, that she was wrong about me. Could we meet up and talk? I thought about it for maybe 5 seconds then typed back, no thanks, I'm good. She kept texting and she realised I was the one all along that material things don't matter, that she loved me and wanted to fix things. I finally called her and said, you didn't want to break. You wanted to trade up. Now that your backup plan crashed, you think you can just come back. That's not how this works. She started crying, saying she was young and stupid and influenced by her friends. I told her those friends would still be in her life, still judging her choices, still making her feel like she settled. I wasn't going to be someone's backup plan or second choice. My new neighbor, Kelly, had been helping me pick out paint colors for the living room. She was a teacher, thought it was cool that I could build and fix things. We've been grabbing coffee on Saturday mornings after I finished work on the house. Nothing serious yet, but it felt easy and real. She never once made me feel like I wasn't enough. Last week, Jessica showed up at my house unannounced, saw Kelly's car in the driveway and me showing her the deck I just built. Jessica just stood there on the sidewalk staring, then got back in her car and left. I got one final text from her that night saying she understood and hoped I'd be happy. I deleted the message and got back to planning the housewarming party. Turns out being a welder who owns his own house, And knows his worth is pretty great, actually.

My father said, don't listen to them, they're liars. But Nora said he ties our hands behind our backs. He's been doing it for four years. The hospital called the police immediately. The doctors found severe nerve damage, dislocated shoulders, torn ligaments and permanent loss of function in several fingers. One doctor looked at my X rays and started crying. My father told the police, this is normal. They're lying about the severity. Child services put us in foster care while they investigated. My father hired his brother, who is a doctor, to write fake medical reports saying our injuries were from a genetic disorder. He submitted these to child services and demanded we be he returned to him. Our case worker called and said, your father has medical evidence that contradicts your story. We're reconsidering custody. I said, he's lying. Please don't send us back. She said, we'll schedule a hearing. Two weeks later, my father brought my mother to our foster home to prove we were lying. When she walked through the door, her hands were tied behind her back. She was crying and her shoulders were visibly dislocated. She said, girls, please tell them the truth. Tell them you made this up. I stared at her and said, mom, what did he do to you? She said, I'm choosing this to show proper submission. Our foster mother said, your hands are tied. How is that A choice. My father said she's demonstrating that our family's practices are voluntary. But my mother was shaking from pain and could barely stand. Our foster father called the police immediately. When the officers arrived, one of them said, ma'am, are you being held against your will? My mother tried to say no, but started sobbing. The officer said to my father, untie her hands right now. My father said, this is a private family matter. The officer said, this is criminal abuse and arrested him on the spot. My father went to prison for child abuse. My mother eventually testified against him and admitted he'd forced her to come with tied hands. Child services gave her a choice between leaving him or losing custody permanently. She chose him. I had three surgeries but still can't lift my arms above my head. I haven't spoken to either parent since.

She'd been specifically positioned as her mentor by our director. They worked closely together on every major account. Courtney knew everything about her, her routines, her insecurities, her habits. I pulled Courtney into my office an hour later. She immediately went defensive, crossing her arms and saying it was just a basic white girl costume and the name tag was completely random. Beatrix is a normal name, she insisted. There's probably thousands of Beatrices in America, but I'd already checked. I asked HR to pull Courtney's access logs from our system and three weeks before Halloween, she'd requested Beatrix's employee file. She'd also accessed the company directory to view Beatrix's profile photo four times that week, all at odd hours, midnight, 2:00am. When I confronted her with the time stamps, Courtney's expression changed complete. The fake confusion vanished. I was just looking, she said flatly. No emotion. That's not illegal. I suspended her pending a full investigation. That afternoon, Beatrix called in sick. I texted her asking if she was okay, telling her to take whatever time she needed. She read the message at three fourteen PM but didn't respond. Day two, nothing. Her calls went straight to voicemail. Day three, her mother called me at 6 a. And her voice was frantic, breaking, have you seen Beatrice? She didn't come home last night. She's not answering anyone. Her roommate hasn't seen her since yesterday morning. They filed a missing person report. That evening at the sheriff station. By day 4, police found her car at Cold Water Canyon Trail about 40 minutes from our office. Keys still in the ignition, phone on the passenger seat, battery dead. Her last text to her mother sent at eleven fifty three PM on day 2. I can't do this anymore. I'm so sorry for everything. They've been searching the woods for 3 days now. Search and rest you teams, tracking dogs, Thermal drones, volunteers from our office. Nothing. Just her footprints leading into the forest and disappearing near the creek. Courtney's lawyer sent our company a cease and desist yesterday claiming we're harassing his client and creating a hostile work environment for her. My boss, the same one who voted for Courtney's costume, pulled me aside this morning and told me to drop the entire investigation. We can't prove anything, he said, and we're opening ourselves up to a massive lawsuit. I keep thinking about Beatrix sitting in my office with her hands shaking, twisting that silver ring, how small her voice sounded when she said I trusted her. How Courtney's face went completely cold when I mentioned those midnight access logs. The search team is going out again tomorrow at dawn. I'm going with them this time. I should have been there for Halloween.

But true friends adapt, she said, raising her glass. That's when I stood up. Speaking of adapting, I said, I have something to share. I pulled out my phone, connected it to the bar's TV system that the manager had graciously let me access an hour earlier. Before we toast to friendship, I thought everyone should see this. The security footage played on the giant screen. Rachel's hand extending cash, the stylist nodding, Rachel checking that I wasn't watching. The whole bar went silent. Three hundred dollars. I to the room. That's what Rachel paid to have my hair chopped off before my wedding. The salon manager confirmed it. The stylist confessed. When confronted with the footage, Rachel's face went from confused to panicked to furious in seconds. That's not. You're misunderstanding what you're seeing, she started. The stylist admitted everything. Rachel. She still had the exact bills in her wallet. Three hundred dollar bills. The other women started murmuring. My cousin Amy stood up. You sabotaged her hair on purpose before her wedding. Rachel tried to defend herself. It wasn't sabotage. I thought she'd look better with short hair, more sophisticated. That long hair was aging her. I was doing her a favor. My sister laughed. Not a nice laugh. You paid someone behind her back to do something you knew she didn't want, and you think that's a favor? Rachel turned to me. You're being so dramatic about this. It's just hair. It grows back. You're right. I said it does grow back. But trust doesn't. And neither does friendship after someone shows you who they really are. The room was staring at Rachel. Now she tried one more defense. I've been your best friend for 12 years. I've always looked out for you. No, I said. You've been threatened by me for 12 years. Every time something good happened in my life, you found a way to taint it. But you smiled through it all. Hugged me through the pain you caused. Made me think you were my safety net, when really, you were the one pushing me off the cliff. I turned back to the group. Rachel's not invited to my wedding anymore. She's not my maid of honor. She's not my friend. And I wanted all. All of you to know exactly why so she can't spin this story later. Rachel grabbed her purse and ran out. Half the women followed her to the parking lot, not to comfort her, but to make sure she left. My sister took over the party, ordered champagne, made a new toast about real friendship and karma. The wedding was flawless until the reception, when James's best man pulled me aside with a confession. Rachel had contacted him weeks before, begging him to convince James to call off the wedding.

It started the day my father caught me brushing my hair in front of the bathroom mirror a few weeks before he joined a group that he told us was for men's empowerment. He grabbed my wrist and said, what are you doing? I said, just brushing my hair. He said, you're being vain. Women's hands are instruments of sin. He made me and my sister Nora stand in the living room while he got rope from the garage. He said, from this day forward, all daughters in this house will keep their hands bound behind their backs. It will teach you humility and keep you from temptation. My mother stood next to him and said, your father knows what's best. My father used thick rope that he tied tight enough to hurt our wrists. We had to sleep with our hands tied. We had to eat with our hands tied. We had to do all our chores with our hands tied. The first day, I tried to wash dishes by holding the sponge in my mouth. My father watched and said, maybe now you'll appreciate how easy you had it before cooking became impossible. I had to lean over the stove and use my face to push pots around. I burned my cheek trying to stir soup. Nora dropped a pot of boiling water and scolded her legs because she couldn't catch it. My father said, you're Clumsy. You need more practice. My brothers were allowed to keep their hands free and would watch us struggle while eating dinner at the table. They'd laugh when we dropped things or burned ourselves. My father encouraged it and said how pathetic females are without men to guide them. Within a month, my shoulders were in constant pain. My wrists bled where the rope cut into them, and my father would re tie the bindings over the wounds. Nora developed nerve damage in her arms and started losing feeling in her fingers. She said, dad, I can't feel my hands anymore. He said, good. That means you're not thinking about using them for sinful purposes. My mother helped him enforce the rules. When I begged her to untie me, just for an hour, she said, you're being selfish. Your father knows what's best. We weren't allowed to leave the house. My father pulled us out of school and said seeing other women with free hands would corrupt you. Simple things like opening doors became impossible. We had to ram them with our shoulders or push them with our heads. I developed infections in my shoulders from the constant strain. Nora's hands turned purple from lack of circulation, and her fingers curled into claws. My father said, this is proof that women's hands were meant to be useless. When I was 16, I collapsed in the kitchen. My shoulder had finally given out completely. I heard something pop. I couldn't move My arm and the pain was so severe I vomited. Nora screamed, mom, help! Something's wrong! My father said she's faking to get sympathy. When I still couldn't get up after two hours, my mother finally called an ambulance.

I'd grown it out for three years specifically for the wedding. Rachel knew this. She'd been there through every trim, every deep conditioning treatment, every moment. I said no to a fun new cut because I wanted that long, romantic updo for my wedding day. She was supposed to protect me at the salon. That's why she came along instead. When I closed my eyes for the wash, she slipped the stylist $300 cash and whispered new instructions, cut it short, Pixie short. Say it was a miscommunication. The stylist took the money. When I opened my eyes, two feet of hair covered the floor and Rachel was fake gasping, hand over her mouth, playing shocked. The stylist kept apologizing, saying she thought I said I wanted a dramatic change, that I was tired of the length. I sobbed for two hours. Rachel held me, rubbed my back, said maybe it was meant to be that I'd look edgy and modern now. He offered to pay for extensions, but we both knew they'd never look right. With only six days to blend them properly that night, I couldn't stop thinking about Rachel's reaction. Too perfect, too rehearsed. The stylist had cut with such confidence, no hesitation, no checking in like they usually do with big changes. I called the salon the next morning, asked to speak to the manager, told her I suspected something happened. But needed to know for sure. She reviewed the security footage, called me back within an hour. Your friend handed our stylist money while you were at the wash station. We have it on camera. The audio is muffled, but you can see the cash exchange clearly. She offered to fire the stylist, offered free services for a year. I said no. Just emailed me the footage. I watched it 20 times. Rachel's smug little smile as she handed over the bills. The stylist nodding eagerly. Rachel checking to make sure I still had my eyes closed. I didn't confront her, not yet. Instead, I called James, told him everything. He was furious, but I asked him to wait. Let me handle this my way. Four days before the wedding, Rachel threw my bachelorette party, 15 women at a wine bar she booked. During her toast, she went on about our 12 year friendship, how she'd always been there for me, how she was so happy I found James.

I'm in community college and sitting in the study lounge near the vending machines. I'm feeling extra confident today wearing my good wig, the expensive one my parents bought me as a gift. Real human hair and looks exactly like my real hair before cancer took it. I'm halfway through my biology chapter when this younger kid plops down next to me, probably 14 in that program for special students. Hi, how are you today? Big smile, bouncing a little. Good. Just studying, I say, trying to be polite. Your hair is the prettiest thing ever. Without warning, his fingers are running through my hair. Whoa. Personal space, please. I scoot away uncomfortably, but trying to be nice. His face completely changes. I want it. Want what? Your hair? Give it to me so I can take it home. My eyes widened. Um, I don't think so, but it's a wig and I can show you where to buy it. I say. I don't want to buy it. I want to wear your wig. Now, at this point, I think to myself, this can't be real. I'm trying to show him the website on my phone when he suddenly lunges forward and yanks my wig clean off my head. The air conditioning hits my bare scalp. Thankfully, the study lounge is pretty empty, but still, I was embarrassed and my cheeks got red. My hands are shaking as I grab For my wig, but he's holding it above his head like a trophy. Give it back, I said. I managed to snatch it from his hands and quickly put it back on, adjusting it with trembling fingers. That wasn't nice, I say. My voice unsteady, I pack my stuff as fast as I can and start walking toward the exit. My heart still pounding, but I'm thinking, okay, that was horrible, but it's over now. I'm halfway cross the lounge trying to calm my breathing when something hard slams into the back of my head. The impact makes me stumble forward. I turn around and his shoe is on the floor behind me. This kid just threw his shoe at my head. You can't just throw things at people. I'm looking around desperately for a professor, security, anyone, but it's that dead time between classes. The lounge is still mostly empty except for some students way in the back corner with headphones on. Before I can move, he's charging at me, actually running full speed. I'm freaking terrified. He crashes into me and starts hitting my arms, scratching at my face. I'm trying to protect myself, holding my arms up to block him.

I immediately clocked that hoe in the face, and she fell back into the flowers. Why would you say that? I screamed, not caring that everyone in the funeral home turned to stare. Annie held her face, looking more sad than hurt. It seems you don't know about your father's double life. What are you talking about? I looked around the room and noticed something strange. Everyone was avoiding my eyes. My aunt suddenly found the calculator app fascinating. My cousins whispered behind their hands. Even the funeral director looked uncomfortable, like he knew something I didn't. The entire room felt heavy with a secret they all shared except me. I grabbed Annie's arm and pulled her into the hallway. Tell me what my father did right now. She shook her head and pressed her lips together. I don't want to speak it in fear that I'll be excluded from heaven like that lustful monster. Just speaking the words might condemn me, too. This was insane. Annie and I had been friends since kindergarten. She'd slept over my house hundreds of times. My dad had driven us to school and made us pancakes and taught us both to ride bikes. What could he have possibly done that was so terrible? She thought saying it would damn her soul. I stormed back into the viewing room and found my mom dabbing her Eyes by the guestbook. Mom, what is everyone talking about? What did dad do? Her face crumpled and fresh tears started flowing. It's absolutely disgusting. I can't even think about it without feeling sick. She hurried toward the bathroom, leaving me standing there even more confused. My Uncle Gary was outside smoking with some other relatives. He'd been my dad's brother and best friend. Surely he'd tell me the truth. But when I asked him, he just shook his head and stared at the ground. I don't know if I can even call him my brother anymore. What he did goes against everything our family believes in. He flicked his cigarette away and walked back inside without another word. I was getting desperate now. My father was lying in a casket inside, and everyone was acting like he'd been some kind of monster. What secret could be so horrible that his own brother disowned? I found my grandma sitting on a bench outside, smoking her Virginia Slims. If anyone would give me a straight answer, it was her. Grandma didn't believe in sugar coating anything and had opinions about everything. Grandma, please. Everyone's acting like dad did something unforgivable, but no one will tell me what. I sat down next to her, trying not to cry. She took a long drag and rolled her eyes. Oh, please. You want to know what your father did? She pulled out her phone and scrolled through Facebook with her perfectly manicured nails. After Your whore of a mother cheated on your father and left him. He got super drunk one night, posted a video of himself at a party with his friends. I break.

Why would you say that about mom, I asked. Shocked. No reason, he said quickly, and walked away to look at Aunt Darla's body in the casket. I stood there confused, watching him stare down at my aunt's peaceful face. My sister Zoe came up beside me and grabbed my arm. Did dad tell you that thing about mom? She asked. I swear he has absolutely no shame. Why would he say that, I asked, still trying to process what just happened. Don't you know about dad and Aunt Darla? Did they have an affair? Zoe laughed, but it wasn't a happy sound. I wish it's much more complicated than that. She pulled me outside the church into the parking lot. The air was cold and I could see my breath. Zoe looked around to make sure nobody followed us. You, I have to swear you won't repeat this to anyone, she said. I swear dad knew Aunt Darla before he even met mom. They were dating for three years. They were so in love it made everyone sick. Dad bought a ring and everything. What happened, mom happened. She was Darla's younger sister and she was obsessed with dad. She wanted him so bad she used to follow them on dates. This was getting weird. I'd never heard any of this before. My parents always acted like they'd been Together forever. One night, dad was going to propose at this fancy restaurant. Darla left early to get ready. She was walking across the parking lot when someone hit her with their car. Oh, my god. It was mom. She ran over her own sister. Darla was paralyzed from the waist down. She couldn't have kids anymore. I felt sick. My mom had crippled her own sister out of jealousy. But here's where it gets really messed up, Zoe continued. Darla always wanted kids. She'd frozen her eggs before the accident just in case. So she asked mom to be her surrogate to carry dad and Darla's baby. Mom agreed to that. She said yes. She went through the whole process, nine months of pregnancy. Everyone thought she was being this amazing sister. Zoe stopped talking and looked back at the search. Through the window, we could see dad still standing by the casket. What happened? I asked, even though I was scared to know. Mom lied. She never used Darla's eggs. She used her own. When the baby was born, it was mom and Dad's kid it, not Darla's. That was me, wasn't it? I already knew the answer. Yeah. You were supposed to be Darla's son. Dad didn't find out until after you were born. Mom had the doctors in on it. She paid them to fake the records. Sat down on the curb feeling like I might throw up. My whole life was built on my mom. Stealing me from my aunt. When dad found out, he tried to leave, Zoe said, sitting next to me. But mom had planned for that, too. What did she do? She told dad if he didn't marry her, she'd accuse him of assault. She had fake evidence ready, photos she doctored. Witness.

Growing up, she made sure I knew my place. You're the practice sister, the one guys date before they find someone like me. She'd say it at family dinners, at parties, anywhere with an audience. When I got my first boyfriend at 16, she told him I had commitment issues, broke up with me two weeks later. When I got into community college, she announced at Thanksgiving that not everyone can handle real universities. Meanwhile, everyone hung on her every word about law school rankings and internship offers. The pattern never changed. Any achievement I had got minimized. Any relationship I started got poisoned. She'd befriend my boyfriends, plant seeds of doubt and comfort me when things fell apart. You're just not relationship material, she'd say, rubbing my back. Some people are meant to be alone. By 25, I'd stopped trying, stopped dating, stopped sharing anything good that happened in my life because she'd find a way to ruin it. Then she met Nathan, Perfect Nathan with his finance job, his tailored suits, his parents summer house in Cape Cod. She paraded him around like a trophy she'd won. Post a couple photos constantly with captions about finally finding someone who sees my worth. At Sunday dinner, she'd make him tell stories about expensive restaurants and weekend trips. He touched his arm possessively whenever I Walked into the room like I might steal him just by existing. Six months in, they got engaged. The ring was massive. She made sure everyone saw it, holding her hand up to the light at every opportunity. The engagement party was at our parents house. She'd invited everyone, Nathan's colleagues, law school friends, distant relatives who barely knew us. That morning, she cornered me in the kitchen. I need you to tone it down tonight. Nathan's colleagues are here and I can't have you embarrassing me. She looked me up and down. Maybe wear something plain. Black is good on you. And try not to talk too much about your job. Nobody wants to hear about retail management. I wore black, stayed in the corner. I politely, when people talk to me, gave one word answers. But Nathan kept glancing at me during dinner. Not in a creepy way, more like he was trying to figure something out, like he was seeing something he hadn't noticed before. My sister noticed, too. She got louder, more animated, touched his shoulder, constantly interrupted me every time I started to speak. Oh, she's exaggerating. That's not.

I wrote him, like, 10 letters in the first month, but he never wrote back. I couldn't understand why my brother would ignore me when I needed him. My uncle came to visit after six months and asked why I hadn't been writing to Jonathan. He said Jonathan kept asking about me and was worried something was wrong. That's when I found out mom had been throwing away every single letter I sent. When I confronted her, she admitted it. She said Sam told her to do it because he didn't want Jonathan causing problems from jail. I begged her to let us write to each other. She said no. She even called the prison and told them I was a minor, so they wouldn't accept my letters even if I sent them directly. I've gone two years without talking to my brother while James made my life hell. But now Jonathan's coming home in two weeks, and mom has been acting so weird. She barely talks, just stares at her phone looking stressed. He knows I'm going to tell him everything. The best part is watching Sam and James. Last week, James mentioned something about finding his own apartment and moving out soon. He's 19 and has never had a job in his life, but suddenly he wants to move out right before Jonathan comes home. Sam keeps asking mom if Jonathan knows what's been going on. Mom says she doesn't think so, but She's not sure. Every time I mention my brother coming home, I watch the color drain from their faces. They get this look of pure fear, and I love it. Yesterday, James asked me if I was planning to tell Jonathan about what happened while he was gone. I just smiled, then said, I miss my brother so much, and we have a lot to catch up on. He went straight to his room, and I heard him on the phone looking at apartments. Here's the thing. They don't know yet. The house we're living in actually belongs to Jonathan. Dad left it to him in his will, but he had to be 20 to inherit it. He turned 20 in February while he was in jail. So, technically, Sam and James are living in my brother's house.

My brother Jonathan is 20 now and he's been in jail for the past two years, but he's coming home in two weeks. And watching my stepdad and stepbrother panic has been the most satisfying thing ever. Let me explain. Our dad died when I was 7 and Jonathan was ten. Before dad died, he always told Jonathan to look after me no matter what. My brother took that seriously, like really seriously. He became super protective of me after that. Three years after dad died, mom started dating Sam. Sam came with his son James, who was the same age as Jonathan. From day 1, Jonathan and Sam didn't get along. My brother has this thing where he doesn't just respect people automatically. You have to earn it with him. Sam tried acting like he was Jonathan's dad, giving him orders and setting rules. Every single time, Jonathan just ignored him. It drove Sam crazy. James thought he could copy his dad and try to boss Jonathan around, too. That was a mistake. The worst part was James making fun of our dad. I was in my room one day when I heard James telling his friends that my dad probably died because he was weak. He was laughing about it. I started crying and Jonathan heard me from downstairs. Never seen my brother move that fast. He went straight to James's room. And I heard this loud thud. When I came out, James was on the floor, completely knocked out. Jonathan had punched him so hard that James didn't wake up for like five minutes after that. Everyone walked on eggshells around Jonathan. If anyone even looked at me wrong, all Jonathan had to do was stare at them and they'd back off immediately. James was terrified of him. Sam was, too. But he acted tough around mom. Then two years ago, Jonathan got arrested with his friend for something completely unrelated. I can't say what, but it wasn't about James or anything violent at home. He got sentenced to jail time and suddenly everything changed. The second Jonathan left, James started bullying me bad. He'd call me names, knock my stuff over, lock me out of the bathroom. I told mom, but she just said boys will be boys and to toughen up. Sam acted like he didn't see anything. I tried writing letters to Jonathan because I missed him so much and needed to tell.

Mom whispered, stay quiet, he has a future. But my doctor didn't blink. I'm 27 now, but this happened two years ago in Ashford, Washington, a small timber town where gossip spreads faster than smoke from the mill. My family looked perfect from the outside. Dad ran the hardware store on Main. Mom shared the church bake sale. And my older brother Lucas was the golden boy, star quarterback turned business school prodigy. Me, I was the quiet daughter who painted in the garage. It was a Friday in September, seven forty three PM at a family cookout for Lucas's early acceptance to a Seattle firm. Mom decorated the backyard with blue and silver balloons and I even brought a 39 dollar cake from Costco. Lucas had already down to two IPA's. When I congratulated him, I thought I was being kind. But Lucas heard something else. Don't sound so jealous, sneered. You'll figure your life out someday. Dad laughed like it was a joke. I felt heat crawl up my neck. I'm proud of you, Luke, I said. That's all. Later, while carrying paper plates inside, he cornered me near the kitchen island. Why did you talk to my girlfriend about me being drunk last week? His voice was low but sharp. She asked if you were okay, I explained. I said you were stressed. Wrong answer. His eyes narrowed and before I could step back, he shoved me hard into the edge of The counter, I heard a crack. White hot pain shot across my chest. I collapsed, clutching my side. Mom rushed in. What happened, she demanded. Lucas muttered. She tripped. My breath came shallow, every inhale like glass. He pushed me, I wheezed. Mom froze, then knelt close, her voice trembling. Stay quiet. He has a future. Those words hurt worse than my ribs. By ten PM, I was back in my apartment wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The bruise spread like spill old ink. I could barely lift my arm. My phone buzzed nonstop. Mom offering Advil, dad saying don't blow this up. Lucas never called. At 6:00am the next morning, I drove myself to Saint Mark's clinic. Every pot hole a fresh stab. The doctor was Doctor Patel, a calm woman in her.

Look, all I wanted was one peaceful and civil Thanksgiving dinner for the kids, a nice family meal where everyone could just get along for a few hours. That's why I invited my ex husband, even if I can't stand the cheating jerk. On the day of the dinner, I spent hours running around, cleaning, decorating, cooking, setting everything up for the guests. I was still stuffing the Turkey when the doorbell suddenly rang. I wiped off the mess on my apron and walked over to the front door. Yo, my ex husband greeted. You're early, I said. Surprised considering he was always late to our dates before and had been late to the divorce hearing as well. Yeah, well, I brought the family, he said, before stepping aside, bringing me face to face with his new girlfriend, Kelly, and her three kids. I forced a smile and quickly pulled him aside. This isn't okay. You can't just suddenly bring people to my house uninvited to a dinner I've been preparing weeks for, I whispered angrily. He crossed his arms. But if I told you, you would have said no. Come on, it's Thanksgiving. What are you going to do, turn away children, he asked. Clearly expecting this conversation to pop up just as I was about to give my permission. Kelly, his girlfriend, walked in and immediately wrinkled her nose. Oh, you went with that color scheme. Interesting choice. Her kids ran straight past me without even saying hello. Within minutes, they grabbed half the cheese plate I'd spent an hour arranging. Growing boys, Kelly said with a shrug, while they shoved crackers in their mouths. I smiled tightly then turned to my ex. Watch them. They're your responsibility, okay? He rolled his eyes. I sighed and went back to the kitchen doing my best to focus on my to do list. But just as I was about to place the Turkey in the oven, I heard screaming. My daughter ran into the kitchen in a panic. Mama, the couch, the carpet, she gasped, dragging me out to see Kelly's kids jumping and running in the living room with their buddies, shoes on, leaving brown streaks across the cream fabric. Hey, hey, stop that, I shouted. But they ignored me and continued running around. They ran between other guests, spilling juice all over the floor and on other people. Then they started throwing dinner rolls at each other across the living room while the adults were talking. Every time I asked them to stop, Kelly would say they're just being kids and go right back to her phone. My ex said nothing. But then I heard the sound of something shattering in the kitchen. One of the kids and run in stuffed his finger into the food and accidentally knocked down my grandmother's old porcelain serving dish. I grabbed his shoulders and glared, that's bad. Apologize and Clean up, I demanded. The kid just laughed, stuck out his tongue and kicked me in the shin before running off. I turned to Kelly and my.

When I first started, Monday, I drafted a licensing agreement, 12% of gross revenue from my patented products, industry Standard. Wednesday, Cameron burst in waving the agreement. What the hell is this? A licensing agreement for my patents? These are company products. Products I designed and patented under my name. I showed him my contract. No IP clause. Dad's going to hear about this. He already has. This is extortion. This is business. 12% is reasonable. We'll fire you and stop making your products. Those products are 78% of your revenue. But you're the CEO. Your call. Dad showed up two hours later. Why would you do this? We're family. Family that told me I don't have what it takes. Family that gave everything to Cameron. You are an employee. Exactly. Employees with patents license them to negotiation. 10% of gross revenue, five year contract, quarterly payments. First check, $87,500. Six months later, I signed with our biggest competitor, 15% of their revenue from my products, plus 40% higher salary and equity. I resigned. You're giving our competitor access to our products. Cameron's face went white. My products, there's a difference. Within three months, the competitor adapted my designs and took the company's market share. Revenue dropped 15% the first quarter, then 12% more. Cameron hired three replacement engineers in six months. None could replicate my work. You can't copy innovation when you don't understand the principles behind it. A year later, dad called. Can we meet? We met. At a coffee shop, he looked aged 10 years. The business is struggling. Come back, I'll give you whatever you want. You'll give me what I built. How generous. Please don't let everything I built fall apart. Everything you built was falling apart before I showed up. I saved it once, not again. Dad started crying. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't see how much you contributed. I appreciate that, but it doesn't change anything. The company filed for bankruptcy 18 months after I left. Bought out for parts. Dad's life's work gone. Cameron's working in sales now. Mom called me selfish. I stopped taking her calls. The thing about being the bigger person is that it only works if the other people involved eventually grow to meet you. My family wasn't growing. They were just expecting me to shrink.

You just don't have what it takes. I agreed completely. What I had instead was the patent rights to everything the business sold. Funny how quickly I developed what it takes. For a decade, I've been the product engineer at my family's manufacturing company. We make industrial equipment, conveyor systems, sorting arms, fabrication tools. Annual revenue, $4.5 million. My dad built this from scratch. Now he's 68 with heart problems. Doctor said step back or risk cardiac arrest. Enter my brother, Cameron, 28, business degree, groomed for leadership since birth. While I designed products in the workshop covered in metal shavings, Cameron attended networking events and took clients to expensive dinners while I pulled all nighters testing prototypes. He practiced his golf swing. Last month, dad called a family meeting. I'm stepping back. Cameron is the new CEO. He looked at me. You're a great engineer, but you don't have what it takes to run a company. You don't have the social skills, the business acumen, the vision. Any objections? None. I said you're absolutely right. That night, I pulled out my patent file, 47 patents all under my name when I started 10 years ago. Dad was too cheap for a patent attorney. Patents are expensive, not worth it for small businesses. So I filed them myself, 75,000 thousand dollars of my own money over a decade. I mentioned it at family dinners. Dad would nod and change the subject. My Employment contract, online template, no intellectual property clause, nothing saying my inventions belong to the company. I pointed this out when signing. Should we add something about IP rights? We're family. Everything you do belongs to the company. That's understood. Understood but not legally binding. I spent the weekend reviewing patent law. When you own a patent, nobody can manufacture it without permission. The company had been manufacturing my patented products for a decade without a licensing agreement. I compiled the data. 78% of the company's revenue came from my designs. The RS seven sorting arm alone, 35% of annual sales. Without my innovations, they'd still be selling generic knockoffs at razor thin margins like dad was do.

So there was this girl in my graphic design class named Tara. We got paired up for this big semester project about a month in, and honestly, I thought I hit the Jackpot. She started calling me D instead of Dev, which felt personal, you know, like we had our own thing going. Every Tuesday and Thursday after class, we'd walk to the train station together. She show me these random memes on her phone that were actually hilarious, not the basic stuff everyone else shared. Once she even told me I had the kind of vibe you write poetry about. I mean, who says that to someone they're not interested in, right? The whole thing felt different than other friendships I'd had with girls. She'd text me at, like, 11 at night with random thoughts about our project or send me screenshots of design tutorials she found. I started looking forward to those messages more than I probably should have. Three weeks into working together, she invited me over to her place to work on our final presentation. I spent way too long getting ready. Stopped at the corner store to grab those fancy chips she mentioned liking, and even printed out extra copies of all our sketches so she wouldn't have to worry about it. Her apartment was exactly what I expected. Plants everywhere, fairy lights strung up around the windows, and this vintage record player. Sitting on a wooden crate, the whole place smelled like lavender and some kind of incense that actually didn't make me want to sneeze. She put on this Phoebe Bridgers album while we worked, and I pretended to know who that was. We spread all our materials out on her bed, since her desk was covered with art supplies. And for a solid two hours, everything felt perfect. She'd laugh at my dumb jokes. Our hands would brush when we reached for the same marker, and she kept saying how glad she was that we got paired together. Around 8, she. She said she was going to grab us some drinks from the kitchen. The second she left the room, her phone lit up on the desk next to me. It was face up, showing her lock screen. And I wasn't trying to be nosy, but it was right there. The background was a photo.

My ex boyfriend, Jake, and I broke up two years ago, but we stayed friends. He was dating this girl, Emma, who seemed nice enough, and when their wedding invitation came in the mail, I honestly felt happy for them. The invitation said cocktail attire, and I had this gorgeous white dress that I bought for my cousin's rehearsal dinner but never got to wear. Here's the thing, though. It wasn't wedding dress white. It was more like cream colored with tiny silver dots all over it. I paired it with a navy blazer and navy shoes. I thought I looked appropriate and classy. My roommate even said I looked great when I left that morning, I got to the church about 15 minutes before the ceremony started. The. The moment I walked in, I felt every single person's eyes on me. The ushers kind of froze when they saw me, and this older woman in the front row actually gasped out loud. I started to panic, but figured maybe I was just imagining things. Then Jake's mom spotted me. She marched over in her purple mother of the groom dress, grabbed my arm, and whispered, what on earth were you thinking? I was so confused. I asked her what she meant, and she just stared at my dress like I had shown up naked. That's when it hit me. White dress wedding. Oh, no. I Tried to explain that it was cream, not white, and I had a blazer, but she wasn't having it. She told me I needed to leave immediately or she'd have security escort me out. I was mortified. But then Jake appeared from the back room where he was getting ready. He saw the commotion and came over. His mom started explaining the situation to him, pointing at my dress like it was evidence in a crime scene. Jake looked at me, then at his mom, then back at me. I expected him to be angry or embarrassed. Instead, he started laughing. Not mean laughing, but genuine can't help it laughing. He said, mom

I'm fine, she said. Dylan was talking about me, something about wishing. I don't know. She wouldn't say exactly. Dylan's face went pale. Luna, what exactly did she tell you? I asked.

It was taken out of context. What context makes that okay? Luna asked. You're married to my sister. You have two kids. What is wrong with you? Everyone always fawns over you, Dylan said.

She's the one who helped you get your job. She's the one who supported you through Your dad's death, she's raising your children practically alone and you're stuck, Luna.

The kids can have the spare room. Luna, this isn't your problem, Dylan said. It became my problem when you made me part of your sick fantasy. Luna shot back, what else do you do? Stare at my photos, compare us, pretend she's me. Stop, Dylan said, no, I want to know how long have you been pretending my sister is me? Since the wedding, since the honeymoon. Every time you stop, Dylan shouted. I'm hanging up, Luna said, Lily, I'll leave the door unlocked. And Dylan, I'm telling everyone, mom, mom, Dad, cousins, everyone, they should know what kind of man you are. She hung up. Dylan stared at me. This is your fault. My fault. You had to make a big deal about it. Now she hates me. Your whole family will hate me. You did this. You admitted you married me to get close to my sister. I never said that exactly. You said I was a consolation prize. You said you're stuck with me. You said I'll never measure up because it's true. He exploded. You're ordinary. You're boring. You're not special.

I've heard it all before. I put the Gatorade in my fridge, ate the soup myself. But Friday broke me. Spencer text at eleven forty seven PM bro, emergency, can you cover my shift tomorrow morning 6:00am at the restaurant? I'll owe you big time. Please, man, I'm desperate. I had plans driving three hours to see my grandma, first time in three months. But Spencer's message said emergency in all caps. So I cancelled, called my grandma, told her something urgent, came up at work, worked his entire 8 hour shift on 4 hours of sleep. Breakfast rush on Saturday is brutal. Got yelled at by customers, spilled coffee on my shirt, made 67 Bubba dollars in tips. He never showed up to thank me, never texted, never acknowledged it happened. Saturday night around nine PM exhausted and lying in bed, I open Instagram. Spent answer story. He's at a concert the weekend. The same concert he told me he couldn't afford when I asked him to go two weeks ago. Tickets were $150. He said he was broke. But there he is, front row section with the same group from Dave and Buster's. That's when something inside me snapped. I opened my phone and really looked at my contacts, 327 people started scrolling through messages. Every single conversation was me reaching out first, me asking how they were, me making plans, me being there. Found the group chat for my birthday last month, 47 people. I'd asked if anyone wanted to grab dinner. Two people responded. One sent a thumbs up emoji, the other said maybe and ghosted. Nobody came. I ate pizza alone in my apartment and told myself it was fine. These people don't care about me. They care about what I can do for them. I'm the guy who covers shifts, who helps people move, who loans $40 and never asks for it back. The backup friend they remember when they need something. So yesterday at 2:00am, I deleted every group chat, all 8 of them, removed two 284 people from my contacts, kept only family and three people who've actually shown up for me. My phone's been silent for 26 hours. No texts, no calls, no hey, man, where'd you go? And honestly, it feels exactly the same as when I had 300 friends.

I've had a ton of friends my whole life, 300+ contacts, eight different group chats, always someone to text. Growing up, I was never the kid sitting alone at lunch. I was the guy people invited to everything, birthday parties, game nights, random mall hangouts. I thought that meant something real. But here's what nobody talks about. I could disappear for months and not a single person would check on me. I know this because I tested it last summer. Stopped initiating conversations completely. Just stopped. Didn't text first, didn't make plans, didn't comment on anyone's posts. Wanna know how long it took for someone to reach out? 47 days. And it wasn't even to see how I was doing. It was my friend Alex asking if he could borrow my PlayStation. Not, hey, man, haven't heard from you. You good? Just, yo, can I grab your PS five this weekend? I gave it to him because that's what I do. But last Tuesday made everything crystal here. My best friend Spencer, the guy I've known since sixth grade, the one I helped to move apartments twice, the one who slept on my couch for two weeks when his parents kicked him out, texted me Tuesday afternoon, Yo, bro, can't hang today. Super sick. My parents won't let me leave the house. Rain check. I responded immediately. No worries, man. Feel better soon. Seriously, let Me know if you need anything. I genuinely felt bad for him. Even went to target and bought Gatorade and soup planning to leave it on his porch. Two hours later, I'm sitting in my room scrolling Instagram because I had nothing else to do. That's when I see it. Spencer's story posted 47 minutes ago. He's a Dave and Buster's not just with one or two people. There's like 12 people crammed into the frame, people I've never even met. They're all laughing, playing arcade games, taking shots at a booth. He's in the center with his arm around some girl looking like he's having the absolute time of his life. The same time he told me he was too sick to leave his house. I just stared at my phone for like 10 minutes. My stomach dropped. Not because he went out but because he lied directly to my face. And the worst part, I wasn't even surprised. I didn't confront him. What was the point? He just make up some excuse about how his parents.

He said it at his company Christmas party. Drunk on whiskey and years of pretending, we were standing by the bar when his colleague Brett mentioned how lucky he was to have such a beautiful wife. Yeah, well, you should see her sister, my husband Dylan said, swaying. Now that's the real prize. This one's just the consolation. Brett laughed nervously. I stood there holding my cocktail, feeling my whole world tilt. What did you just say, I asked. Dylan turned to me like he'd forgotten I was there. Nothing, baby. Just guy talk. But Brett was already backing away, mumbling about finding his wife. You said I'm a consolation prize. You're being sensitive. You said you wished you'd married Luna. He shrugged, actually shrugged. Can't marry your wife's sister. That's not how it works. So you married me instead. Someone had to marry you first. He said it like it was obvious, like it was a plan. Eight years. Eight years of marriage. And he was telling me I was the pathway to my younger sister. We need to leave, I said. Party's just getting started. We're leaving now. In the car, he tried to backtrack. I didn't mean it. How it sounded. How did you mean it? Luna is gorgeous. Everyone knows it. You know it. But I chose you because you couldn't choose her. That's not, look, when I met you both that summer. At your parents place. Luna was 18. You were 23. It made more sense. What made more sense? He sighed like I was being difficult dating you. She was too young. Your parents would have freaked out. But you were perfect. Same family, same genetics. Just more appropriate. Same genetics. Like I was a placeholder with the right DNA. Did you ever love me? I asked. Of course I love you. You're my wife. That's not an answer. What do you want me to say? That I never noticed how beautiful your sister is? I never wondered. What if everyone wonders not about their wife's sister? Not for eight years. We drove in silence until we got home. I went straight to our bedroom, started pulling out suitcases. What are you doing? He asked from the doorway. What does it look like? You're overreacting. So I find your sister attractive. So what? I married you. I had kids with you. He grabbed my arm. Stop being dramatic. You can't leave over this. Watch me.

Aurora looked mortified, her eyes darting to me for help. The room was dead silent with shock. I finally snapped out of my shock and grabbed his arm, pulling him toward the hallway. What are you doing? I hissed, trying to keep my voice down. He barely looked at me, his eyes still locked on Aurora through the doorway. Is that your friend over there? He asked, practically salivating with desire. I've always wanted to do it with an R word and she's so cute. For one, my crush, this man I've been falling for, just called my beautiful friend a slur and admitted he wanted to use her for his sick fetish. I was disgusted. The girl's girl in me went from zero to nuclear in about half a second. While he was still staring at Aurora like she was prey, I whipped out my iPhone and texted Isabella, your brother is sexually harassing my disabled friend. Get here now. Then I immediately added, bring your mom. Isabella's response was instant. What? Mom's already getting ready to leave. She said she's disappointed in her son. He had no idea what was coming. I shot a quick text to our roommate group chat. Keep this creep busy and away from Aurora. War is on the way. Trust me. And the beautiful thing about having girls who get it, no questions asked. My friend Cindy immediately stood up and positioned herself between Nathaniel and Aurora. Kathy started loudly asking him about his major. Jess accidentally spilled her drink near him so he'd have to move back. He kept trying to get back to Aurora, getting more frustrated each time someone intercepted him. I, I just want to talk to her, he whined, not understanding why we'd formed a human shield. Aurora had wielded herself behind the couch at this point, and I could see her hands shaking with anger. I kept thinking about how much shit he was about to be in, and I couldn't stop smiling with excitement. Boom. The door practically exploded open. Nathaniel's mom, Mrs. Beaumont, burst in like a warrior, except fully dressed in Lululemon. And Isabella was right behind her with her phone out recording. The look on Nathaniel's face when he saw his mom was pure panic. Nathaniel James Beaumont, his mom shouted at the top of her lungs. She stormed over and grabbed his ear like he was a child caught stealing cookies. What did you just say to this young woman? Mom, I can explain. It's not what it looks like. He stammered with embarrassment, but she twisted his ear harder. Isabella told me everything. You're disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. She turned to Aurora, her voice softening instantly. Sweetheart, I am so sorry. This is not how I raised him. Isabella started laughing at him and we all joined in, with Aurora laughing the loudest. It's been 10 years since then and Nathan's still single. He'll probably die alone.

We dated for seven years, met in junior year of high school through his best friend. He was 280 pounds, 5 7 with acne and a dorky smile that made my heart melt. Everyone told me I could do better. My friends literally staged an intervention. But here's what they didn't see. He wrote me handwritten letters every anniversary, six pages front and back. He noticed when I changed my lipstick, remembered my coffee order from three months ago, made me feel like the only person who mattered in the entire world. He got bullied constantly. I found him crying in his car twice. Kids called him the blob in the hallways. He told me once that I was the only good thing in his life. I told him I loved every part of him and wouldn't change a single thing. He sobbed for an hour that day. Three years ago, we made a New Year's resolution together, gym membership, meal at, the whole thing. We cleared out our pantries on January 2nd, threw away $200 worth of junk food, bought a 500 dollar blender. We were doing this together, getting healthy as a team. The first six months, we went to the gym at 6:00am every morning. We were each other's accountability partners. When one of us wanted to quit, the other pushed us forward. We took progress photos every two weeks. I was so proud of us. Then he started seeing results. Real results. By month eight, he dropped 60 pounds. By month 12, 95 pounds. By 18 months, he'd lost 130 pounds total. He had ABS, actual visible ABS, pecs, arms that look like they belonged on a fitness model. I couldn't have been prouder. I bragged about him to everyone. My boyfriend did this. My boyfriend transformed his entire life. That's when everything changed here. 2, he started going to the gym twice a day, morning and night. We stopped eating dinner together because he meal prepped separately. Now your portions are too big, he'd say. Watching me eat pasta. You should track your macros. He'd grab my arm and squeeze it. See, too soft. You need to lift more. Then came the Instagram posts, shirtless gym selfies. Every three days the comments rolled in. You're so hot now. Damn, daddy, let me touch those ABS. You single. He showed me every single one, laughed about them, read them out loud like trophies, like he wanted me to see how desired he was now. Then he started replying. I watched him type out, come feel them anytime to some girl named Britney. When I said it was disrespectful, he told me I was being insecure and controlling, said it was just gym culture and I wouldn't understand because I wasn't.

We stopped going on dates. He said he didn't want to eat out because it would mess up his cut. When I suggested a movie, he said he needed his eight hours of sleep or muscle recovery. Every conversation became about his workout plan, his protein intake, his body fat percentage. I tried talking about my promotion at work. He'd look at his phone. I'd ask about his day. He'd tell me about his PR on deadlifts. For 20 minutes straight last month. I asked if he still loved me. He said, of course without looking up from his phone. Didn't even make eye contact. Two weeks ago, I found out why. His phone died during dinner, and he asked to use mine to text his trainer. I unlocked it and handed it over. He texted, gave it back. That's when I saw the message. Thread still open? Honestly, bro, I think I'm outgrowing her. She's dragging me down. Embarrassed to bring her to gym events. Everyone there is it and she just isn't. Might need to upgrade soon. You know any single girls from your five PM class? I'm 5 5, 125 pounds. I defended him when he was literally double my size and people called him disgusting to his face. I sat on that for three days. Couldn't eat, sleep. Reread his old letters. The ones where he called me his angel, where he said my love saved his life, where he promised he'd love Me forever. Exactly as I was yesterday. I told him I was leaving. He actually laughed like it was funny. Said good luck finding someone better. You're average at best. Maybe lose 15 pounds first. I grabbed all seven of his anniversary letters from my drawer, sat down across from him at the kitchen table and read them out loud. Every single word. All six pages of the first one. You see me when no one else does. You loved me when I hated myself. You defended me when the world was cruel. I promise I'll spend my entire life making you feel as beautiful as you make me feel. I'd be nothing without you. His face crumbled halfway through letter three. Started crying. Said he didn't mean any of it. That he was just trying to get in at the gym. That he got caught up in the attention. That he still loved me. That we could fix this. I stacked all seven letters neatly, slid them across the table. The man who wrote these died the day he got ABS. I don't know who you are anymore. I walked out. My lease ends in six weeks. I'm not looking back. I thought I was going to marry him. Instead, I watched him become everything he used to hate. The bullies won after all.

I was a senior in high school. Average grades, clean record, nothing special. But for some reason, Mrs. Frank, my algebra teacher, hated me. She'd been at the school for over a decade. Administrators loved her, but in class, she was brutal. Every time I asked a question, which I did a lot because math was hard for me, she'd humiliate me in front of everyone. Here comes the slow boy again. Wow. Surprise, surprise. You don't get it. I've been teaching 10 years, and that's the dumbest question I've ever heard. I tried reporting her. They'd send someone to watch her class. And like magic, she was sweet and professional. Then back to being cruel the next day. So I came up with a plan. I went to Radio Shack, bought a pocket recorder, and started collecting everything. Every insult, every jab. Sometimes I'd even bait her just to catch more. By the end of the year, I had gold. I asked one last question in class, and she responded, that is the single dumbest question I've ever heard. That was it. I packed my bag and walked out straight to the nurse's office to sign myself out for the day. I was 18. I didn't need permission. That night, I compiled every recording into one glorious, damming audio file. Next morning, I met with the principal. He listened to a few minutes, paused, and said, we need more people. Here, the next day, I walked into a conference room with the principal, vice principal, school officer, district board members, and missus Frank. I hit play. I watched their faces morph from bored to shocked to horrified. Some of their jaws literally dropped. Missus Frank sat in silence, roasting herself for 10 straight minutes. The air was electric. When it ended, the principal looked around and simply said, I think we've heard everything we need to thank you. I left the room. The last time I saw Missus Frank, she was crying, and we locked eyes. I gave her the coldest, most satisfying smile of my life. Next week, she was gone. Words spread fast. I was suddenly a legend. The kid who took down the untouchable teacher. She didn't just lose her job, she lost her reputation, her connections, everything. And I didn't even raise my voice. Just hit record.

Polar bears, leopards, tigers, and specifically Nile crocodiles are the only four animals that choose to hunt humans.

After catching some fish, she didn't eat them. Instead, she crushed the small ones, breaking them into pieces, and threw them back into the sea. The smell of blood quickly spread through the water. Anna stood on the shore, holding a sharp stick, staring intently at the surface of the water. Soon, a large, confused fish swam near her. Anna seized the chance and with luck managed to spear the fish. This brought her a sense of joy. When she made it back to the shore, she endured the torment of hunger, but didn't eat the fish right away. Instead, she hung it high in a tree, waiting silently. As night fell, she crawled into a sand pit to observe quietly, seemingly waiting for some more dangerous creature to appear. But perhaps due to extreme exhaustion, Anna soon fell into a deep sleep. When she woke up again, she discovered that the fish hanging in the tree was gone. Her eyes widened in horror as she frantically looked around, but found nothing out of the ordinary. Desperate to figure out what was happening on the island, Anna began searching everywhere. Before long, she found a matchbox in the forest. However, as she turned to head back, she heard a sound behind her.

A massive tree covered in what appeared to be human like hair. Without hesitation, he pulled out a dagger and plunged it into the trunk. To his surprise, a strange white liquid began to flow out. Driven by curiosity, he rubbed it onto his hand, eager to examine it. As a drop of the liquid dripped from his finger, something incredible happened. Green leaves began to sprout from the surrounding weeds, growing rapidly before his eyes. Astonished by the liquids miraculous properties, the man quickly applied it to the wound on his stomach. Within moments, just three seconds, his injury was completely healed. Now fully convinced of the liquids extraordinary powers, the man had a daring idea. He continued stabbing the tree, collecting the flowing liquid in his hand, drank it greedily, unable to resist the temptation. What happened next was beyond belief. The tree suddenly erupted in a blinding light. Before the man could react, a golden beam shot into his body. The pain was unbearable. He collapsed to the ground, overwhelmed by the agony. Then something extraordinary occurred. It felt as though something inside him was bursting. A wave of green plants erupted from his stomach, growing uncontrollably. Panicking, the man desperately tried to tear the plants away, but they grew faster than he could keep up. In a matter of moments, the soil began to swallow him whole. Just as hope seemed lost, a new twist was about to unfold.

And here it is. Not just boyfriends on my list. I also invited the lady from Staples who gives me attitude. She can suck it too. Fine. But how is inviting Johnny and his new wife a victory? Oh, like this. Hi, Mrs. Johnny. Nice to meet you. You got him. But I got these and all this. So suck it. I'm not so sure this is healthy. Are you kidding me? This is the healthiest thing I've done in my life. I even thought about inviting my mother to come and suck It, but then she'd realize maybe I didn't commit suicide two years ago like my note said.

My mother stood up at Thanksgiving and gave a toast about how she sacrificed everything to raise five children on her own. My siblings all raised their glasses. My brother Donovan looked at me and said, you could at least pretend to appreciate our mother for once. I looked around the table at my four siblings and wondered if any of them actually remembered our childhood. I was 11 years old when I became a mother to four children. My father left, and my mother checked out completely. She'd stay in her bedroom for days at a time, and I'd slide food under her door, hoping she'd eat. I Learned to forge her signature in sixth grade because she wouldn't get out of bed to sign permission slips. I worked at a grocery store at 15 and lied about my age so I could buy food when her disability checks ran. Now I got a full scholarship to a college three hours away and turned it down because I couldn't leave my siblings alone with her. I missed my own prom because my youngest brother had pneumonia and no one else was going to take him to the emergency room. I raised four children before I turned 18, and none of them remember. They remember mom being sad. They remember mom being tired. They don't remember that I was the one who made sure they ate and bathed and Got to school and had clean. They don't remember me staying up until two in the morning helping with homework while mom slept in the next room. They don't remember me walking three miles to the pharmacy when Vera had an ear infection because mom wouldn't get out of bed and we didn't have a car. Now we're all adults, and I'm still doing it. I coordinate every holiday and every birthday. I babysit all nine of their kids on a rotating schedule that I manage. I covered Donovan's mortgage.

That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about how eager my mom had been for me to choose, how she kept pushing Friday as the deadline, how Marcus had already moved boxes into her car. I started going through old emails on the family computer. My mom had been researching single car accidents, break line failures and something called widows benefits for the past six months. Thursday morning, I went to my dad's office and told him everything I'd found. He didn't believe me at first, but then I showed him the search history, the messages I'd screenshotted. We went to the police. They said they couldn't do anything based on internet searches and text messages. Lots of people research morbid things. Doesn't mean they're planning murder. But my dad was scared. He stayed at a hotel Thursday night instead of going home. I stayed with my best friend, Sarah. At 2 a. M, my phone rang. It was my mom. Where's your father? Her voice was shaking. He was supposed to be home hours ago. He's safe, I said. Away from you. The line went silent. Then she said something that made my blood freeze. You don't understand what you've done. Marcus needed that money. We're in debt to some very dangerous people. She hung up. Friday morning, my dad and I went back to the police with the recording of that call. This time they listened. They told us to stay. Away from the house while they investigated. Six hours later, they called. They'd found Marcus at our house with bags of my dad's clothes, staged a car in the garage. The car was running. He'd been planning to make it look like my dad had taken his own life. My mom was arrested as an accessory. Turns out Marcus had a gambling problem and owed over $300,000 to loan sharks. The life insurance policy was for $500,000. They'd plan the whole divorce as a cover story. I'm 18 now, living with my dad in a new city. My mom took a plea deal and got seven years. Marcus got 15. The house sold last month. My dad split the money with me for college. I haven't spoken to my mom since the trial. She sends letters sometimes, but I don't open them.

I froze mid scoop. What are you talking about? She didn't even look up from her phone. Your dad and I are getting divorced. We're selling the house. You have until Friday to decide who you want to live with. I was 17. They've been fighting for months, but I didn't think it was this bad. That night, I tried talking to my dad. He was in the garage packing boxes. Dad, what's going on? He finally stopped and looked at me. Your mom and I agreed. You're old enough to choose. No pressure. But there was pressure. My mom kept making comments about how Dad's new apartment was smaller. My dad mentioned Mom's boyfriend was moving in next month. Wait, boyfriend? Yeah, dad said, not meeting my eyes. Marcus. They met at her office. I felt sick. How long does it matter? He went back to packing. Next day, I confronted my mom. She was in her bedroom sorting through old photos and I noticed she was only keeping the ones without my dad in them. Marcus and I have been together for 4 months, she admitted. But your father knew we were already separated emotionally. Four months. The house went up for sale six months ago. Her face changed. Your father told you that? That's when I found the real estate listing on her laptop. She listed The house eight months ago before the fights even started. I went back to my dad that night. When did you actually find out about Marcus? He was silent for a long time. Then he pulled out his phone and showed me a text. Red. My mom had been planning to leave for over a year. The messages went back to when I was 16. But it got worse. There was a message from my mom to Marcus that, just need to wait until the life insurance policy matures in November. Then we can be together. My blood went cold. Dad, what life insurance policy? His face went pale. I took one out three years ago. Your mom's the beneficiary. It matures next week. Friday, I whispered. The same day they wanted me to choose the same.

I had 46. After a month and a half of barely surviving, I brought this up to my principal. She denied my request immediately. There's no money in the budget. Make it work or leave. I was stubborn. I thought I could handle it. To do the bare minimum of my job, I was at school from 6:00am to nine PM every weekday. Then I spent my entire week and planning lessons and grading. I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating right. I was drowning. When my first evaluation came, I expected to be torn apart. Instead, my principal gave me all satisfactory marks. I was confused, but relieved. I didn't realize she was setting me up. A few more weeks passed, and I couldn't take it anymore. I contacted the union and explained everything. The class sizes, the impossible schedule, the lack of support. They said they'd handle it. Nothing changed. By Thanksgiving, I was completely burnt out. But I had two days off for the break. So I went to a potluck dinner with some old college friends to try and decompress. I started talking to this guy I barely knew and his husband about my new job. I mentioned how amazing my students were, how creative and smart, but how frustrated I was that I couldn't give them the attention they deserved. With 46 kids in the room at once. The husband raised an eyebrow. What school do you work at? I told him, I didn't think twice about it. That Monday morning at 805:00am, my principal came storming into my classroom. Her face was right red. Her hands were shaking. She slammed the door so hard, the windows rattled. You talk to someone about this school? Well, about me. I'm going to have you fired. I'm going to make sure you never work in education again. You're done. I just stared at her, completely frozen. Then my phone buzzed. It was an email from the district office asking me to come in during my lunch break. Turns out the guy I talked to at Thanksgiving wasn't just some random person. He was a district superintendent. He'd filed a formal complaint that morning about unsafe working conditions, contract violations, and administrative retaliation. By 10:00am, my principal was being escorted out of the building by security. By noon, I had an educational assistant assigned to my classroom. By the end of the week, my schedule was completely redone. With proper planning time.

What insane behind the scenes drama did you have to hide from students? My first teaching job was at a Title 1 elementary school as an art teacher. I was 25, fresh out of college, and so excited I couldn't sleep the week before school started. That excitement died pretty fast. A week before classes began, I emailed the principal asking about my keys and badge so I could prep my classroom. No response. I called the office. Nothing. I waited 3 days and finally contacted the district office directly. Two days before school started, I got an angry email from my principal saying I should have been more patient and that going to the district was inappropriate. She made me wait until the day before classes to get my keys. When I finally opened my classroom door, I froze. The room was completely packed with storage desks stacked to the ceiling, 100 chairs piled on top of each other, filing cabinets blocking the windows. I had less than 24 hours to make this functional. I worked until midnight clearing it out. The first day of school, I still didn't have a schedule. I had no idea which classes I was teaching or when. I emailed my principal at 7:00am asking for it. She replied twenty minutes later, accusing me of pressuring and bullying her. I apologized and asked again. She sent the schedule 10 minutes after the first bell rang. That's when I saw it. I had two Classes scheduled at the same time. 46 kids in one room by myself. I also had seven 45 minute periods with no breaks except a 30 minute lunch. I was teaching every grade every single day of the week. There was no time to prep between classes, no time to set up materials, no time to even breathe. I went to my principal's office during lunch and asked if we could adjust the schedule. I explained I was losing instruction time because I had to scramble to get supplies ready while the next class was walking in. She came to my classroom that afternoon while students were waiting in the hallway. She didn't even lower her voice. You're a first year teacher. You don't know what you need. Deal with it or quit. I decided not to quit. Instead, I read the entire district teacher contract that night. There was a section about classroom size. Any class over 30 students is required to have

Emily in the center, furiously tapping her phone. Her friends glancing at watches, looking impatient. Then she pulled some guy forward. He crouched with a lock pick kit and started trying to break in. Mister Williams door swung open. He stepped into the hallway, arms crossed, watching in silence. He had already called the police when he noticed the lock picking. Ten minutes later, the police arrived. I watched on camera as two officers approached. Emily's face went pale. The guy quickly shoved the lock picks away. The officers pointed toward the exit. Emily's guests shuffled away. Bradley glanced over. Already? I showed him the feed. He laughed. Natural consequences. I smirked. Exactly. The next day, my phone exploded. You were beyond out of line. My friends saw everything. We had to take the cake to a random cafe. Then mom called. Emily cried all night. I took a breath. Mom? I told Emily no from the start. She ignored me and planned everything anyway. But you should have warned her. Did Emily tell you about last year? Neighbors complained. Police almost called. I spent a week cleaning up beer and broken dishes. Silence! I'm not doing that again. The family group chat exploded. How could you do this to your sister? You should be more understanding. That's harsh. She's family. I typed. I said no from the start. Emily ignored me. Last year, my house turned into a nightclub. Neighbors complained. Fish is Broken beer everywhere. Yet I'm the bad guy. Some went quiet, others kept going. You should be the bigger person. Publicly humiliating your sister. That's cold. I stared at the screen, exhausted. Then I pressed and held the chat name and hit leave group. Anna has left the group. I set my phone down. No more messages. No more judgment. When we returned home, Emily showed up within minutes. I can't believe you did that to me. I leaned against the counter, calm. Are you here to yell? Do you know how humiliated I was? I shrugged. I told you no from the start. You chose not to listen. She froze. Realizing she had no excuse, she scowled. You never know how to go with the flow. I smiled. And that's why I don't clean up after your parties anymore. She stormed out. Emily stopped texting, stopped calling, avoided family gatherings completely. And honestly, I enjoy the silence.

I'm throwing my birthday party here. I already told everyone this weekend. I nearly dropped my coffee. Wait, what? She flipped her hair. Your place is spacious. The garden is gorgeous. I've already invited everyone. I crossed my arms. You never asked us. She waved dismissively. You can't say no. I've already ordered the cake, booked a DJ. You'd embarrass me if you cancel. How can I cancel something I never agreed to? She rolled her eyes. Saturday at seven PM. Then she left, texting furiously. Last year, Emily begged me to host her small gathering. I trusted her. What she promised would be ten close friends turned into 30 people. EDM blasting, beer pong on my dining table, shattered dishes, a guy smoking shisha in my living room. By nine PM, my neighbor knocked. Music is deafening. The whole building can hear it. When I cut the music and kicked everyone out, Emily looked at me like I'd ruined her life. But when I saw the beer soaked carpets, smoke, stench, broken plates, I swore she'd never host another party here again. Next morning, I woke to a text from mom. I'm so excited about Emily's party at your place. Emily? Had told the entire family without my permission. I opened the family group chat. Emily's message. This weekend is going to be amazing. Anna and Bradley's place is perfect. Bradley read over my shoulder and sighed. So what's the plan? I smiled. Just wait and see. For four days I stayed silent. Emily kept posting. Got the cake. We're having a DJ. Dress code white and gold. Meanwhile, I booked 2 plane tickets to the Maldives. We were leaving Saturday morning, one day before her party. Before we left, I stopped by my neighbor, Mister Williams apartment. We'll be away for a few days. If anyone causes trouble, especially my sister, please call the police. He raised an eyebrow, amused. Got it all planned out, huh? I don't make the same mistake twice. The night of Emily's party, I was on a beach in the Maldives, cocktail in hand.

She didn't introduce herself or write her name on the board. Instead, she announced we're going to play a quick game. Everyone whose parents are divorced, please move to the left quadrant of the room. A confused murmur spread, but we complied. Roughly half the class shuffled left. I remained on the right amongst the kids from intact families. Now she continued, her voice sharp and controlled. If you want a dog, stay standing. Everyone else, sit down. Three kids on the left side sat. Immediately, the questions grew increasingly peculiar. Right side, she instructed, her gaze sweeping over us. Anyone who walks to school moved to the back wall. My stomach tightened. Four of us, including me, moved to the rear. I hated being isolated like this. What kind of bizarre icebreaker was this? Back row, she said, now focusing entirely on us. If you stop at the corner store on Maple Street before school, stay standing. Only Kay and I were left standing. My heart hammered against my ribs. Okay, the substitute said smoothly. Sit down if you visit that store specifically on Tuesdays and Thursdays, okay, sat down. Leaving me utterly alone, standing against the back corner wall. The substitute teacher held my gaze for a long, unsettling moment. A slow, chilling smile spread across her face. Perfect. She ordered us all back to our desks. The whispers were frantic, but she launched Straight into teaching geometry as if nothing unusual had happened. I couldn't concentrate. Why did she need to map out my exact morning routine? At lunch, the confusion turned to dread. Maybe it was some kind of strange sociological study my friend George offered. Emma pointed out the most unnerving detail. She never even told us her name. When we returned after lunch, the substitute was gone. Principal Hilton stood at the front, his expression grim. Class he began, his voice devoid of its usual warmth. I need you all to help me recreate this morning's activity exactly. He had us repeat the entire sorting process. He meticulously wrote down every name and position, snapping photos with his phone. When he reached the final step and I stood alone in the back corner, his face went alarmingly pale. Did she say anything specific to you? He asked me, urgency in his eyes. No, sir. She just stared at me and then said, perfect, and told us to sit down. He immediately called my parents. Within minutes, I was in his office with my mother, my father and two police officers. The truth dropped like a lead weight.

Then he turned 18 and knocked on my door. I hadn't seen my son in 10 years, not by choice. When he was 8, my ex wife Denise took him and vanished while I was at work. One day I was tucking him into bed. The next day, his room was empty. She changed their names, moved it's away and told everyone I'd abandoned them. For 10 years I've been the deadbeat dad who walked out on his family. That's what she told him. That's what she told her new husband. That's what she told anyone who'd listen. Meanwhile, I spent $80,000 trying to find them, hired lawyers who couldn't track them, filed police reports that went nowhere. The court still made me pay 12 monthly to her parents address. They forwarded it to her secretly while telling police they didn't know where she was. His bedroom exactly the same, Dinosaur wallpaper, toy cars on the shelf, his favorite book on the nightstand. Every birthday and Christmas I sent cards and presents to that address. Her parents returned them all unopened. I kept them in boxes in his closet. 10 years of returned love, 10 years of searching, 10 years of being called a deadbeat while paying support for a son I couldn't find. Three weeks after his 18th birthday, I got a Facebook message that made my hands shake. It just said, are you my dad? And I knew it was Him. He'd remembered my real name from when he was little. We messaged for hours and everything he said hurt to read. He thought I'd walked out when he was 8, never looked back, never sent money while his mom worked 3 jobs. Chose my career over being his father. I begged him to meet me for coffee. He almost said no, but finally agreed. When he walked into that coffee shop, I couldn't believe how much he looked like me. Same eyes, same nervous finger tapping when upset. But his face was full of anger. Mom said you left us for another woman, he said. It felt like being punched. Pulled out my phone. I need to show you something. First came the missing person reports. I'd filed eight of them. His forehead wrinkled. You called the police. That gave me hope. Then receipts from searching that totaled $80,000. His anger started cracking. Why couldn't you find us? I explained the name changes, cash payments, fake profiles. Come to my house. There's more, I said. He followed in his car. That 20 minute drive felt endless. I kept thinking he might turn around and leave. I let him upstairs and opened his old bedroom door. He froze seeing the Dinosaur walls. You kept my room. His voice cracked. Then he saw the closet boxes labeled by year. He opened 9th birthday and found a card saying happy birthday, buddy. Dad loves you. And I'm still looking. He started opening More boxes, 10 years of cards and wrapped presents. Tears filled his eyes. She said, you forgot about me, he, I showed him bank statements with every payment highlighted, $144,000 total. His face turned pale. We lived in roach infested apartments. I wore shoes with holes. Then his eyes went wide. Wait, my mother's parents gave mom cash envelopes every month. Said it was to help out. He looked at me. That was my child support, wasn't it? I nodded. Call your mom.

I sold our house and disappeared. My fiance, Nicole and I had been together for four years. We bought a house together two years ago. Nothing fancy, just a 3 bedroom starter home in the suburbs. We were supposed to get married in six months. Invitations were already ordered. Then one Tuesday night, she came home from work acting weird. She kept checking her phone and wouldn't look me in the eye during dinner. I made spaghetti that night and she barely touched it. Around 9, she finally sat down next to me on the couch and said we needed to talk. My stomach dropped. She told me her ex boyfriend, Jake, had reached out to her on Instagram a few weeks ago. They'd been messaging. He told her he made a huge mistake letting her go and wanted another chance. I just stared at her. She said she still loved me but she needed to know if there was still something there with Jake. She wanted a break, maybe two months just to figure things out. I asked if she was serious. She said yes. She even had it all planned out. She'd stay at her friend Courtney's apartment during the break and we'd revisit everything after she had time to think. I told her, no, there's no break. She wanted to go be with Jake. She could do that. But we were Done. She started crying, saying I was being unfair and not giving her space to process her emotions. I told her to pack a bag and leave. She tried to argue for another hour, kept saying I was overreacting and that lots of couples take breaks. I didn't budge. She finally grabbed some clothes and left around midnight. The next morning, I called a real estate agent. The house was in both our names, but I'd put down the entire down payment with money from my grandpa's inheritance. I explained the situation to the agent and she said we could list it fast if I got Nicole to sign off. I texted Nicole and told her I was selling the house. She called me immediately freaking out. She said I couldn't do that without her permission. I told her she could either sign the papers and take her half of the equity or I'd lawyer up and make it way more expensive for both of us. She came by that weekend to sign everything. She cried the whole time, asked if we could please just talk about this. I handed her the pen and pointed at the signature line. The house sold in three weeks. It was a seller's market and we got 15,000 over asking. I gave Nicole her half of the equity minus what I'd paid for the down payment, came out to about 18,000 for her. I took my money and started looking at apartments in different Cities. I didn't tell anyone where I was going, not my friends, not my family, and definitely not Nicole. She kept texting me. At first it was angry stuff about how I ruined everything and how immature I was. Then it turned into long paragraphs about how she realized she made a mistake and Jake wasn't what she thought he'd be. He said they went on two dates and she felt nothing. She wanted to come home. I blocked her number. I found a one bedroom apartment four hours away in a city I'd always liked. Got a transfer through my job to a branch out there. I packed everything I owned into a moving truck in one day. Didn't even hire movers, just did it myself with a dolly and a lot of trips up and downstairs. My best friend Paul helped me load the truck. He asked if I was sure about this. I told him I'd never been more sure about anything. He gave me a hug and told me to call him when I got settled. Nicole somehow got Paul's number and called him two days after I moved. He told me she was sobbing, asking where I went. He didn't tell her anything. She showed up at my parents house a week later. My mom called me and said Nicole was on their porch begging to know where I was. My mom told her I didn't want to be found and shut the door.

But things seem to have gone south because they're all suddenly calling me non stop. When I found out my wife Elena was having an affair with my younger brother, Adrian, I thought the betrayal couldn't get worse. Then I called my parents. My mother answered on the second ring. Her voice was cold before I even finished my first sentence. Well, can you blame her? Adrian has always been more ambitious than you. Dad got on speaker. Maybe if you'd made something of yourself, she wouldn't have looked elsewhere. I stood there in my kitchen, divorce papers still warm from the printer, listening to my parents defend the man who destroyed my marriage. But it wasn't just them. Elena's parents, the castanos, had always treated Adrian like the son they wished they'd had, the successful lawyer, the charmer, the golden boy. When Elena confessed everything at family dinner, her father actually clapped Adrian on the shoulder. At least she's upgrading, her mother smiled. We always knew you two were better suited. That night, I packed my things alone. No one called to check on me. No one asked if I was okay. My phone stayed silent except for one text from my brother. No hard feelings. Yeah. She just realized she wanted more. The divorce was swift. Elena got the house we bought together because her father was friends with the judge. Adrian moved in three weeks later. I saw the photos on social media, them hosting dinner parties in my dining room, sleeping in my bedroom, living the life I'd built. Both families blended seamlessly. My parents invited the castanos to Thanksgiving. Elena posted pictures with my mother, my own mother, wearing matching aprons. The caption read, so grateful for family that truly cares. I wasn't invited. For 18 months, I rebuilt in silence, got a better job, moved to a better apartment, started therapy. The only family member who reached out was my Uncle Terry, my dad's brother, who'd been the black sheep for years. He understood what it meant to be erased. Then last Tuesday, my phone started ringing. First Elena's mother. I ignored it, then her father, then my mother, then Adrian. By Wednesday morning, I had 47 missed calls and my voicemail was full. The messages were frantic.

I beat cancer at 19, but it won in its own way. I'll never have children. The radiation that saved me also robbed me of the only future I'd ever really wanted, to be a mother. I have four siblings who always treated me like I was defective, even before the cancer diagnosis. Too sensitive to handle real life, too weak to be taken seriously. When I got sick, they visit the hospital in shifts, just long enough to post photos about being supportive siblings. Never long enough for the hard part. Now I'm 31, healthy, successful, but to them, I'm still that sick kid who shouldn't want too much from life. For 12 years, I lived for my siblings kids. When my sister had her first baby, I was there cutting the umbilical cord because her husband fainted. I memorized feeding schedules, Learned every lullaby, never missed a single school play. Eight kids between four siblings and I knew them all, every allergy, every fear, every dream. While my siblings worked late or went on date nights, I was teaching their kids to ride bikes, help thing with homework, making Halloween costumes from scratch. I drove two hours each way to attend my nephew's kindergarten graduation because his parents had a conference. I held my niece through her first heartbreak while her mom was at book club. Every birthday party I arrived early to set up and stayed late to clean. The kids started calling me first when they needed something. Auntie understands, they say. Three weeks ago, my sister Gina asked me to come to our parents house. Important family discussion, she texted. I arrived with a trunk full of Christmas gifts I've been collecting since July. The living room felt like a courtroom, all four siblings and chairs facing one empty seat. No kids, Gina read from her phone. We're here because your relationship with our children has become inappropriate, my brother Mark jumped in. You buy them things without asking us, undermining our authority. The kids mention you constantly, Gina said, jaw tight. Beatrice asked if she could live with you last week. That's not. I started. You're weirdly obsessed, said Ross. It's uncomfortable. You need to find your own life instead of trying to steal ours. My youngest sister, Vanessa, sighed. Look, some people are meant to be mothers and honestly, the way you latch onto our kids proves you wouldn't be able to handle your own. You're too intense, too desperate. Gina stood up. We've discussed it. You're not invited to Christmas this year. The kids need to bond with their actual family without you confusing things. We're doing this for you, too, Mark added. Maybe without the kids as a crutch, you'll finally move on. I sat there for 30 seconds that felt like hours, then left without a word. At home, my boyfriend Alex found me sobbing on the bathroom floor. He held me. While I explained everything, come to my family's Christmas, he, please. Christmas morning at Alex's parents house was terrifying. I knew nobody except Alex, but his nephew ran straight to me with a Dinosaur book. Within minutes, I was reading to three kids on the couch. Alex's mom watched from the doorway. She's a natural, she told Alex's sister. During dinner, his sister asked if we had kids. When Alex explained about my cancer, his mom grabbed my hand. Honey, watching you with the little ones today, any child would be lucky to have you as their mother. Biology doesn't determine who's meant to be a parent. Love does. Alex's dad added, our kids are already asking when Auntie's coming back. I excused myself to cry in the bathroom, crying happy tears. When I came back, I saw my phone explode with notifications. Mom calling repeatedly. When I finally answered, her voice was shrill. What did you do? You've ruined Christmas. I was confused. What? I'm not even there. Exactly. Beatrice locked herself in the bathroom and won't stop crying for you. The twins refused to open any presents. Miles threw his plate at the wall. Rosie took my phone and called you 17 times before I caught her. My stomach dropped. These kids were suffering because of me. No, wait, Mom, Gina told me not to come. They all said I was toxic, that I was obsessed with the kids. The line went silent. Then Mom's voice turned deadly. Quiet. They said what? I explained the intervention. The words tumbled out how. They called me desperate, inappropriate, said I'd be a terrible mother. Come over here now. Me and Alex pulled into the driveway. Twenty minutes later, the front door burst open. Before we reached it, eight kids rushed me at once, a tsunami of tears and desperation. Beatrice clung to my leg. The twins grabbed my arms. Rosie sobbed into my stomach. I looked up to see my sibling standing in the doorway, faces twisted with rage. Gina started forward, but.

The teacher walked back in. You too? She pointed at me and John. I need you to grab one of your anime drawings. Bring it to the principal's office. My mouth went dry. We went to our lockers. I grabbed my sketchbook. John grabbed his. We walked to the office together. John wasn't talking. His face was white. We entered the office. The principal was there, the officer, the teacher and someone else. The teacher's daughter. She was in our class. But she. He hadn't raised her hand earlier. Why is she here? I asked. Nobody answered. The teacher held out her hand. Your drawings. We gave her our sketchbooks. She handed them to her daughter. The daughter flipped through my entire booklet. Then through John's, then mine, then John's again. Finally, she stopped on one page. The most recent one. The one with the new art style John had been working on. Her finger pointed down. That's it. The police officer stood up. He walked to John. You have the right to remain silent. Handcuffs. John's voice cracked. What? What are you doing? We're taking you to the station. We advise you cooperate. The officer was leading John to the door. John looked back at me. I didn't do anything. Tell them. I couldn't move, couldn't speak. The door closed. John was gone. The daughter left the room. I stood there, shaking. Is anyone going to explain what the hell just happened? I asked Relieved, but worried at the same time. The principal leaned back in his chair. Remember how your class did secret Santa Last week? I nodded. Well, someone gave her daughter a gift. He gestured at the teacher. It was a hand drawn manga. Detailed, multiple pages. I was confused. What? What's wrong with a manga as a present? That's when the teacher's voice cut through. Ice Cold. That manga he gave her showed my underage daughter in inappropriate scenarios with characters from Naruto, Dragon Ball Z, and one piece. I stared at her as tears filled her eyes. Someone drew my daughter as lowly content and gave it to her as a secret Santa gift. The room was spinning. Because it was secret Santa, we didn't know who made it, so we staged this. The principal gestured around. The questions, the filtering, all of it. I sat down. Damn. And John dead ass snitched on himself. Huh

Just looked at me like I was the reason rent prices were so high. Then she turned around and started leading us through the hallways in silence. I turned to my buddy John.

She just called Dexter an idiot. And the principal didn't even flinch. Whatever happened had to have been really serious. Teacher continued, who here has seen Naruto? Two more kids lowered their Hands. You two leave. Seven of us left. Now I looked at John. He was pale, hands gripping his knees. Who here has seen one piece? Three kids shook their heads out. Just five of us now, me, John and three others. My heart was pounding. The officer was taking notes on his clipboard. Who here draws anime, like manga art, the teacher asked. Three other kids hesitated, then shook their heads. Back to class. Just me and John left. The teacher stared at us. Her jaw was clenched. You, too? Back to the classroom. We'll call you later. We stood up immediately and walked out in silence the hallway. John's hands were shaking. Dude, what was that? I whispered. I don't know, man. Something in his voice sounded wrong.

But in the last clip, when she turned toward the camera, a small crescent birthmark showed on her neck. I don't have that birthmark. Olivia does. Judge Patterson watched the screen. Do you have any evidence placing the defendant there? No, your honor. The prosecutor admitted the judge looked at Olivia. Stand up. Do you have a birthmark on your neck? Olivia's hand went to it automatically. I. I just wanted mom and dad to notice me. The courtroom erupted. Bailiff detain Miss Olivia Morrison, the judge said. She's under arrest for theft, perjury, evidence tampering and fraud. All charges against Riley Morrison are dismissed.

Mister Brennan laughed, but it wasn't a real laugh. It was Bitter and angry. Right. So you just happened to have an extra hoodie lying around? I always keep one in my gym bag. Officer Chen was writing everything down. We pulled security footage from the athletics building. Shows you entering the locker room at 4:17 p m. You were at locker 23 B. That's Vincent's locker.

So instead, I decided to give him exactly what he wanted. I told him, fine. He could have my shitty life. All of it. The next day, I went to the registrar's office and transferred all my classes to the most difficult professors on campus, the ones with reputations for being impossible to pass. And I went to the financial aid office and transferred my work study job to Jake. It was a position cleaning bathrooms in the science building that I've been trying to get out of. Anyway, I also transferred my meal plan to him. It was the cheapest one that barely covered two meals a day. Then I went to housing and requested that Jake be moved into my dorm room as my roommate, claiming we'd worked it out between ourselves. But the best part was when I found out Jake had been lying about having dirt on me, he was just bluffing. So I decided to create some real consequences for him. I sent screenshots of all his creepy messages to Megan, to the other girls he'd been pursuing. Turns out, I wasn't the only guy whose girlfriend he'd been trying to steal. Within a week, Jake was drowning in my old life. The professors were giving him failing grades. He was working late shifts cleaning toilets. He was barely eating because the meal plan sucked. His new roommate situation with me was Awkward as hell because I'd started bringing dates over just to mess with him. The girls on campus had started warning each other about him after they saw the screenshots. His reputation was completely destroyed. He tried to transfer out of the classes and get his old job back, but the semester had already started and everything was locked in. Meanwhile, I'd use the situation to upgrade my own life. I got a better job at the campus bookstore, switch to easier classes that actually interested me, and upgraded my meal plan. Megan and I grew closer because she saw how I handled the whole situation without being dramatic or violent. Jake eventually tried to apologize and asked me to switch everything back, but I told him this was what he wanted. He wanted my life, so now he had it. The shitty parts and all. He'd threatened me and tried to steal my girlfriend, so this was just giving him exactly what he asked for. By the end of the semester, Jake had dropped out and moved back home with his parents. Turns out my life wasn't as great as he thought when he actually had to live it.

So my buddy Jake thought he could just waltz into my life and take everything I had because he was jealous of my relationship with Megan. We've been dating for two years and things were actually going pretty well. Not perfect, but good enough that I was thinking about getting serious with her. Jake and I had been friends since freshman year of college. He was one of those guys who always seemed to want what other people had. When I got a new gaming setup, suddenly he needed one, too. When I started working out, he joined my gym. I thought it was just coincidence until he started making weird comments about Megan. At first, it was little things. He'd say stuff like, man, you're so lucky or I wish I could find someone like that. Then it got weirder. He started showing up places where he knew we'd be. Movie nights at my place, study sessions at the library, even our favorite pizza spot on Thursday nights. The breaking point came when I caught him going through my phone while I was in the bathroom at a party. He had opened my messages with Megan and was scrolling through our conversations. When I confronted him, he just laughed it off and said he was looking for the time. But I knew something was up when Megan started acting strange. She'd get quiet when I mentioned Jake and she Stopped wanting to hang out in groups where he'd be there. One night, she finally told me that Jake had been messaging her on Instagram, asking her to hang out without me. Nothing too crazy, but it made her uncomfortable. That's when Jake decided to escalate things. He started spreading rumors about me around campus, telling people I was cheating on Megan, that I was abusive, that I had anger issues. Complete lies. But some people actually believed him because he was good at playing the victim. The final straw was when he cornered me outside my dorm one night and basically threatened me. He said if I didn't break up with Megan, he'd make my life hell. He'd already started telling lies about me to our mutual friends and professors. He said he had dirt on me that could get me kicked out of school. I was furious, but I.

I drove six hours straight and found her starving in a storage closet. In high school, I sold vapes to freshmen and thought fear meant respect. Then I got this girl I was seeing pregnant, spent about four months playing house before I came home drunk one night and she went off saying, you're a loser who will never be a good dad. We'd be better off with you dead. So I drove her to her mom's house and left town. I've been sending her about 500 to 1,000 dollars every month for our daughter working construction 12 hours away. My mom lives near them and was the one who suggested I just live my own life. She checks in on them for me, handles the money, even has my daughter Facetime me once a month. My daughter is always smiling and my mom keeps saying everything's great, so I believe it. At 2:00am, my phone rings. My daughter's voice is on the other end, tiny and terrified. Mommy's gone and I'm hungry and I don't know what to do. I'm already grabbing keys as I tell her, baby, I'm coming right now. Where's Mommy? The line goes dead. I call back voice, voice mail, call my ex, voice mail, call my mom, voice mail. I'm doing 90 on the highway and nobody's answering. Six hours later, I burst through my ex's unlocked door and The smell hits me first, rotting food mixed with chemicals. I find my daughter in a glorified storage closet on a bare mattress with springs poking through, covered in dry.

I carry her to the bathroom, but there's black mold in the tub and no clean towels, so I use my shirt and bottled water from my truck. Then I see the padlocked bedroom door. I kick it open. Inside is a red room with cameras on tripods, ring lights and piles of costumes. My ex told me she was making YouTube movie reactions, not doing cam work, all while my daughter starves in the next room. I scoop up my daughter and drive to the nearest hospital, her little body limp in my arms. The er doctor hooks her to IVs and comes out looking grim. Your daughter is severely malnourished. We also found drugs in her system, secondhand exposure. We have to inform the authorities. I'm furious. Don't worry about the police. I'll call them first. Cops find my ex at some house party. She shows up at the hospital six hours later and I expect her in cuffs, but instead she's with a lawyer. That's my daughter, she says, trying to push past me. The cop steps between us. Ma'am, we need to ask you some questions. About what? About how he abandoned us. She's crying now and I hate that. It looks real. He left when she was a baby. He paid me to keep her away. From him.

Some things need to be addressed. She turned to my mother. Nancy, is there anything you'd like to say to Jake and his family? Mom stammered. I didn't do anything. Jake is lying. Grandma nodded to Uncle Bruce, who pulled up her security camera footage. On a tablet, my mother's voice played loud and clear. Go home. There's no room left. Help! And told me if you showed up late, send you away. The room exploded in whispers. Mom's face went ghost white. Janet, my dad's cousin, shook her head in disgust. Nancy, I never thought you could do something like this. Even animals have more compassion. Then grandma spoke words I'll never forget.

They stumbled out, humiliated and homeless. Charles tried to plead his case, but grandma cut him off. You stayed silent in the face of injustice and benefited from it. That makes you complicit. He stormed out, hissing at me. You've torn this whole family apart. The next morning, grandma called her lawyer. By afternoon, the legal paperwork was in motion. Two properties worth $2 million transferred to. My parents tried one last desperate move. They showed up at my house days later, screaming threats. I called the police, filed a restraining order, and had them legally banned from contact for three years. Thirty days later, they moved out. I renovated both properties and now earned between 8 thousand to 10 thousand dollars a month in rental income. All saved for Logan's future. A year has passed. My parents live in a tiny apartment three states away, surviving on Social Security. Charles moved across the country and hasn't spoken to me since. Meanwhile, my wife Paisley is eight months pregnant. Logan runs to Grandma Helen every weekend with new drawings and stories. And she's framed his Christmas card on her living room wall, where every visitor can see it. Last night, Logan asked the baby in Paisley's belly, hey, baby, when you're born, I'll teach you how to make cards for great grandma. She keeps mine on her wall forever. I don't feel guilty.

He says Sarah told him she wasn't happy with how he proposed. She said she felt embarrassed and wished he'd done it literally anywhere else. Tyler's going off about how she's being ungrateful and shallow. He said he thought it would be spontaneous and cute. Then he asks me straight up, would you be mad if someone proposed to you at the gym? I should have lied. I really should have. But we've been friends since middle school and we've always been honest with each other. So I said, yeah, man, I would hate that. He got quiet. Then he goes, seriously? I tried to explain it to him. I was like, think about it. She's sweaty, her hair is a mess. She probably smells bad. She's in the worst outfit and there are strangers everywhere watching her. That's not how anyone pictures getting engaged. Tyler got defensive. He said the gym is where they met two years ago. He thought it would be meaningful. I told him that's actually a decent idea, but maybe he should have asked her to meet him there when she wasn't mid workout or maybe rent the place out after hours, something where she could at least look decent and not Be actively dripping sweat. He called me shallow, said I was being a bad friend for not backing him up. I told him I was being a good friend by being honest instead of letting him think Sarah was the crazy one. That just made him matter. He said Sarah's been weird ever since the proposal, won't post about it on social media, hasn't really told anyone except her sister. Meanwhile, Tyler already told everyone and showed them the video. He couldn't understand why she wasn't excited. I asked him if he ever actually asked Sarah how she wanted to be proposed to. Dead silence. Then he admitted they never talked about it. He just assumed she'd love anything as long as he proposed.

Apologize to your Uncle William. Levi said nothing. Andrea leaned down and whispered, it's okay, sweetheart. We're right here. Dad's hands curled into fists. The next morning, dad called everyone into the living room before breakfast. The tension from last night still hung in the air like smoke. Levi sat on the couch glued to his mom's iPhone 16 Pro Max, completely unbothered by what he'd done. Dad walked over to him, snatched the phone from his hands without warning and dropped it straight into a mug of steaming hot tea. The phone sank with a harsh crackling pop. Andrea jumped up. Oh, my god, what are you doing? Before Michael could say a word, dad turned to me and gave a slight nod. I stepped forward, looked my brother straight in the eye and raised my middle finger. Cold, direct, unwavering, Andrea freaked William. What the hell is wrong with you? Michael froze, face pale. Levi shrank into the couch, eyes wide. For the first time, dad stepped into Center. How does that feel? That feeling is precisely what William had to carry last night. Andrea pulled the ruined phone from the tea, hands shaking. Dad, that phone cost over $1,500. That's my property. Dad's voice was calm but sharp. And William's laptop was just trash. She froze. I'll call the police then. Go ahead, dad said, and while you're at it, tell them what your kid did to William. The room went dead. Silent that night at dinner, Michael finally spoke, his voice heavy with exhaustion. I, I think it's time to take him somewhere, somewhere that can help him start over. Dad nodded. A behavioral program. William contact them for me. On Saturday, we drove Levi to the camp. He screamed for his mom the whole way, begging us to turn around. Michael gripped the steering wheel so tight, his knuckles turned white. When the gate closed behind Levi, I didn't feel relieved, just empty. It wasn't punishment. It was structure, something he never had. One year later, everything changed. Michael and Andrea opened a small deli. They stopped making excuses and started listening. Levi sent me a handwritten letter, half in English, half in broken German. Sorry, Uncle William. I was wrong. Since then, no more Defiance, no more ugly behavior. Every weekend, I bring him to my apartment. We play video games, eat fried chicken and talk. He's still stubborn, but now he knows when to stop.

What happened after we returned left my parents completely stunned. My son Logan stood on Grandma Helen's porch clutching a handmade Christmas card, a tree cut from green paper with a tiny house spoke curling from the chimney. And I love you great grandma, written in wobbly red crayon. He'd spent a week on it. We'd driven two hours through snow to get there. My mother opened the door, looked at us and said six words that would change everything, go home. There's no room left. Logan's face crumbled. The card trembled in his small hands. She claimed grandma said if we showed up late, she had to turn us away. The lie was so casual, so effortless, like she'd been planning it. So we left. Logan sobbed in the car, clutching the car tighter. Dad, why didn't grandma let us in? I just wanted to give her my card. Did I do something wrong? I had no answer. My throat was too tight to speak. My parents had favored my younger brother Charles and his son Adrian for years. When Adrian was born, my parents gave Charles $5,000 and stayed at the hospital for days helping with the Newborn.

Didn't you tell mom to send us away for being late? Silence then. I never said that, come back right now. When we pulled up again, the entire family was standing outside in the freezing cold. Grandma, my parents, Charles, distant relatives, all of them on the porch, breath visible in the night air, faces lit by Christmas lights. Charles immediately snapped. Cause of you, we've been standing out here freezing. Grandma's voice cut through the night like ice. Shut up. The whole street went silent. She hugged us, then let us inside.

She screamed it right in my face after I refused to babysit for the fourth weekend in a row. I was standing in my kitchen making coffee when she barged in without knocking and just unloaded on me. You never want to spend time with him. You always have some excuse. Admit it. You don't even care about your own grandson. I put my mug down and looked at her. The truth was way more complicated than she thought. Her son, my grandson Austin, was 6 years old. Sweet kid. But my daughter Brooke had been using me as free childcare since he was born. Every single weekend. Sometimes weekdays, too. No notice, just a text saying she was dropping him off. I retired two years ago after working as a nurse for 30 years. I spent three decades taking care of other people. I wanted time for myself. I joined a pottery class on Saturdays, started going to the gym, made plans with friends I hadn't seen in years because I was always too tired or too busy. But Brooke didn't care about any of that. She'd text me Friday night saying, Austin needs you tomorrow at 8:00am, and then show up with him still in pajamas. When I said I had plans, she'd guilt trip me. He's your grandson. Family comes first. Don't you love him? Of course I loved him. But I also loved having a life. The weekend She blew up at me. I had finally said no because I was going on a weekend trip to the coast with my friend Janet. We'd been planning it for three months. Booked a little beach house, made dinner reservations. I was so excited. Brooke called it selfish, said I was choosing strangers over my own family. I reminded her Janet wasn't a stranger. We've been friends since college. Didn't matter to her. After she accused me of not loving Austin, I snapped. I told her the real problem wasn't that I didn't love him. The problem was she expected me to raise him while she went out partying every weekend. She got this look on her face like I'd slapped her. She left, didn't talk to me for two weeks. Then Austin's school called me. Not Brooke. Me. They said there was an emergency and they couldn't reach Brooke. Austin had fallen off the playground equipment and hit his head pretty hard. They needed someone to come immediately. I. It was 20 minutes away. I drove there, going 15 over the speed limit the whole way. When I got there, Austin was sitting in the nurse's office with an ice pack on his forehead. He saw me and started crying. Not because he was hurt. Because he was scared his mom would be mad at him for getting hurt. That broke something in me. I took him to the emergency room, sat with him for four hours while they Did scans and tests. He was fine. Just a mild concussion. The whole time, I kept trying to call Brooke. Straight to voicemail. Every single time. She finally called me back at 7 that night, eight hours after the school called. She was at brunch with friends. Her phone had been on silent. I didn't yell. I just told her Austin was in the hospital and she needed to come get him. She freaked out, rushed over. When she saw he was okay, she hugged him tight. Then she looked at

Then my boss handed me a project spreadsheet. Update the status column by end of shift problem. It was entirely color coded. Red meant urgent, yellow meant in progress, green meant complete. To me, it all looked like murky brownish gray. I pulled him aside. I can do this but I'm color blind. Can you send a version with labels instead of just colors? His face went cold. Are you refusing to do your job? No, I'm asking for accommodation so I can do it correctly. Two hours later, I had a formal write up for insubordination. I filed a complaint with HR requesting it be removed and asking for reasonable accommodation. I brought documentation from my eye doctor. The HR rap Bridget listen to everything. Then she smiled.

Brielle's type 1 diabetic. She wears a pump clip to her belt that delivers insulin. Throughout the day, I'd seen it beep during lunch breaks, just little reminders, but never like this. Never this urgent screaming alarm. I have to go home right now, she said. Already turning my backup supplies in my fridge. If I don't get it in 30 minutes, I'm going into diabetic shop. How far is your house? 23 minutes each way. Her hands were shaking. I called my husband, but he's 40 minutes out. Here's the thing. Company policy was crystal clear. The network center could never be unstaffed. Someone had to be physically present at all times. If we both left, we both be fired immediately. But if she stayed and went into shock with nobody to help, she could die. Go. I said, I'll stay. Until you get back. Tears formed in her eyes. Thank you. I'll drive as fast as I can. The second she left, I called my supervisor voicemail, called the manager on duty voicemail, called the emergency operations line voicemail because nobody checks that during holidays. Rial made it back in 47 minutes, hit traffic. When she walked back in, pump refilled and working, she apologized repeatedly. I told her I do it every time. Next afternoon I.

The other half thought it was a house fire. With a reaction like that, what else could it possibly be? People started organizing, seriously organizing. Mallory created a shared Google DOC for funeral car pools. Samantha set up comfort shifts so someone would always be available to sit with Brielle. We had a rotation schedule and everything. I couldn't stand the girl. But even I signed up for two shifts because whatever happened, it had to be dead. Devastating. Before the concert started, Mister Ford gathered us in a circle.

She'd been friends with Brielle's younger sister on Instagram. You guys, she said breathless. You guys, I figured out what happened. We all leaned in. Her sister got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Silence. That's it. Someone finally asked. That's it. The mom called Her at the concert because they wanted to skip it and meet with the doctor that same night. The appointment was scheduled for seven PM not hospitalized, not emergency surgery, not dying. A scheduled appointment to discuss a completely manageable medical condition. The reaction was immediate. People were pissed. We'd organized car pools to a funeral that didn't exist. Some kids had cried themselves to sleep. We'd rearranged our entire schedules for comfort shifts. Brielle came back to school the following Monday like nothing had happened. He wouldn't talk about it, just said it was too painful to discuss. By lunch, someone had leaked the diabetes diagnosis in the group chat. Brielle got absolutely roasted, not bullied, just called out. People asking her why she screamed like that over diabetes, asking her if she understood what actual tragedy looked like. She switched school fools three weeks later. Her sister, by the way, is completely fine, plays varsity soccer now. Mister Ford still brings up that concert every year as a lesson in keeping perspective during actual emergencies.

Junior year. This girl, Brielle, made everything about her and I mean everything. She'd cry over those Brielle Mclachlan puppy commercials at lunch, full on sobbing with her head on the table. She'd scream random things in the hallway just to see who'd turn around. She once faked a panic attack because someone wore the same shirt as her to school. Most people bought into it. She had this whole crew that treated her like she was made of glass. I tried to ignore her, but we were both in choir so I couldn't escape complete. Then came the spring concert. Twenty minutes before showtime, all 100 of us were on the risers doing final rehearsals. The auditorium was packed with early parents finding seats, programs, wrestling that pre show energy. Brielle was front row center. Obviously. She always made sure she got the spotlight positions. Suddenly the side door opened and Brielle's mom walked in. Not rushed, just purposeful. She went straight to our director, Mr Ford, and whispered something in his ear. He nodded, looked at Brielle and called her name over the microphone. Brielle, can you come down, please? The entire choir went silent. Brielle climbed down from the risers, her heels clicking on the stage floor. Her mom pulled her aside, leaned in close and said maybe three sentences. That's when Brielle screamed. Not a gasp, not a cry, a full horror movie blood curdling scream that Echoed off every wall in that auditorium. Parents and the audience stood up. Some of the freshman girls started crying just from hearing it. Brielle took off running for the exit, but she only made it about 20 feet before her legs gave out. She collapsed right there on the auditorium floor, wailing like someone had ripped her heart out. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Over and over and over. Her mom rushed over, grabbed her by the elbow and practically dragged her out through the side door. The whole thing took maybe 90 seconds, but it felt like an hour. Mr Ford stood there frozen. Nobody knew what to do. Finally, he cleared his throat and said, let's, let's take five minutes. The second we got backstage, everyone pulled out their phones. Our group chat exploded with messages. Someone texted Brielle directly. She responded. Twenty minutes later, nothing will ever be the same. Then why couldn't it have been me? Then she stopped responding entirely. Words spread fast.

She needs it more. I was furious. But then the finance company called and said, you are still the legal owner. No one has the right to sell it. I decided to teach my dad and sister a lesson. Three months ago, I came home from work to find my sister, Victoria, inside my apartment, living there. How did you get in? She looked at me like I was the intruder. This is my place now. Dad transferred ownership. I called my father 10 times. No answer. Finally, a text. I sold the apartment to your sister. She needs it more. I stared at the screen as if it was his property, as if I hadn't paid every mortgage payment for two years. This wasn't new. When I was 7, my mom bought me a Barbie I'd wanted for months. My father snatched it away and gave it to Victoria. She's older. At 10, he gave my scooter away. She needs it more. At 16, I worked all summer for a bike. Less than a week later, Victoria was riding it. When I objected, he called me selfish. Now at 28, he'd taken my apartment. I drove to his house. He sat in his armchair, tea in hand, reading the newspaper. No guilt. You can't do this, I shouted. That apartment belongs to me. He set down his teacup. My name is on the papers. I Had the right. I paid for every cent. Month after month. He shrugged. My name was on the documents. Mother stepped forward. No more silence. You only signed to help her buy it. She paid everything. You never contributed a single dollar. You've mistreated her for years. Always favoring Victoria. If you don't return this apartment, I will divorce you and disown Victoria. Silence filled the room. My father grabbed his keys and walked out. The next morning, my phone rang. Finance company, we received a transfer request for your apartment. There are irregularities. Can you come to our office tomorrow? I'll be there. At the office, the director slid a folder forward. The transfer cannot proceed. This apartment has an outstanding loan. You're the payer, not your father. Hope sparked. So it's still mine? Exactly. He had no right to sell it. Then another file. We discovered something unusual inside. A 20,000.

I've always been my sister's biggest cheerleader. We're only 14 months apart and basically twins. Growing up, she taught me how to perfect my jump shot. I helped her study for the SATs. We've had each other's backs through everything. when she made it to the state basketball finals and asked me to come, I showed up with a foam finger, her Jersey number painted on my face and absolutely no shame. This was the game that could get her a full ride to do college. Scouts were everywhere. The gymnasium was completely sold out. I managed to squeeze into the front row of the student section right behind the team bench. The atmosphere was insane. Everyone was on their feet screaming. But I took it to a whole different level. Every time my sister touched the ball, I went ballistic. That's my sister. Let's go, Maya. I was jumping up and down so hard the bleachers were shaking. About 10 minutes into the first quarter, I noticed this guy sitting in the section across from me, Letterman jacket, perfectly styled hair, surrounded by what looked like the entire football team. He kept shooting me these dark, angry looks. First I thought maybe I was being too obnoxious, so I tried to tone it down just a little. But then during the first time out, I heard him talking loud enough for his whole section To hear someone over there needs to shut up about my girl, like we get it, she's talented, but she belongs to me. My stomach dropped. I looked down at my sister on the court. She was listening to coach, completely locked in on the game. Was he talking about her? I wanted to march over there and ask him directly, but something about his vibe made me uncomfortable. Instead, I convinced myself he had to be dating some other player because if that was my sister's boyfriend, she had terrible taste. Second quarter started and my sister was absolutely on fire. She hit three straight 3 pointers. I couldn't help myself. I went right back to screaming her name, waving that foam finger like my life depended on it. This was her moment. But every single time I cheered, that guy would stare me down with this intense scare.

No nut. November. I used to have a best friend named Jack. Everything was cool until he started making gay jokes. He wasn't even gay. He was just trying to be annoying. It started small at first. Normal joked about me being handsome and stuff like that. But within weeks, the gay jokes became his new form of rage bait. He'd make jokes about how I want him. So when we both got detention at the same time, he kept calling it our detention date and making kissy faces when the teacher wasn't looking. We were five minutes into detention when his hand starts moving up and down under the desk at lightning speed. And there's no paper on his desk. It. It was like he was asserting dominance or something, making sure I knew this was about me. He was breathing like he just ran a Marathon while sitting completely still. He looks up right at me. Not a glance. Full eye contact while his hand is still going full turbo under the desk. My brain just froze. Like when your computer shows you that spinning wheel of death. Then I noticed his chair. He's turned it toward me. And the angle. When he finishes, it's gonna hit my face. I had two minutes, maybe less. His face was getting red. I tried to reach for the phone in my pocket to someone to help, but the teacher, Mister Evans, notices Instantly. Phone on my desk. Now. Mister Evans has a radar for phones, I swear. You know the rules. I walk up and put it on his desk. Locks it in his drawer. Great. No lifeline, no evidence, no nothing. While I was walking back, I can see Jack tracking me with his eyes. That same smirk from when he'd make his stupid jokes. But his hand hasn't stopped moving. I get up real quiet and start moving to the empty seat behind him. Where do you think you're going? Evans doesn't even look up. It's assigned seating only. Go back to your seat, sir. I just need to. You need to apologize to Jack for disrupting his concentration and sit back down. Wait, what? I'm sorry. Go on, apologize. I look at Jack. His smirk gets bigger. Sorry, Jack. His voice comes out all breathless and weird. It's cool, bro. Good. Now sit down. The walk back felt like death row. Lucia, the girl I've had a crush on since freshman year, notices what's happening. Her face goes from confused to horrified to.

So buckle up, because this isn't one of those he fired me and I found a better job karma law posts. No, this is a scorched earth, burn the bridge, salt the ashes situation. I worked at this small tech company for 3 years. I busted my ass. I pulled 70 hour weeks. I trained his nephew. I basically ran the whole damn department while this loud, balding, overcaffeinated micromanager sat in his glass office pretending to be Steve Jobs. Last month, I walked in on a Monday morning and found an HR email waiting for me. Not a meeting, not a warning. An email. We regret to inform you that due to restructuring, your position has been terminated, effective immediately. Restructuring my ass. The next day, I found out his nephew, the same one who asked me how to attach a PDF, got my job and a pay raise. So I snapped. And when I snap, I don't break plates. I break lives. I knew three things. One, his wife Samantha, hated him. Two, his son Tyler, 22, was in my DMs months ago. Oh. His daughter Mia, 25, once told me at a company barbecue that she likes people who take risks. Do you see where this is going? I started with Samantha. I took her out for drinks to vent. One thing LED to another, and let's just say she vented in ways her husband Hadn't experienced in years then because apparently I fully unlocked my villain arc. I replied to Tyler's old DM. Still wanna grab that drink? Tyler came over. We grabbed more than drinks. I'll spare you the details, but let's just say his Xbox wasn't the only thing overheating that night. And then Mia. God bless Mia. She's gorgeous, she's chaotic, and apparently she had a vendetta against her dad too. Within 48 hours, I had an entire side quest going with his entire family tree. Here's where it gets truly evil. I knew my ex boss had a ring camera system. Guess who accidentally left their Bluetooth speaker connected to their living room TV? Yeah, he saw everything live in 4K. Next Monday he tried to confront me in the parking lot of a Starbucks. I just smiled, sipped my caramel macchiato, and said, should have attached the termination letter as a PDF. Boss. The man's face turned the color of a sunburnt tomato. Do I regret it? Absolutely not. Do I have a job now? Also no. But you know what I do have? Peace, satisfaction, and at least three birthday invites to family barbecues he will never attend again. And that, my friends, is how you turn a layoff into a legacy.

My sister in law, Bridget, couldn't have children. And when I got pregnant, she lost her mind. She'd been trying for seven years, while I got pregnant three months after getting married to her brother. She pretended to be supportive, but I could see the hatred in her eyes every time she looked at my belly. Some people get everything so easily, she'd say to anyone who'd listen. Must be nice to not even have to try. When my daughter Lily was born, Bridget immediately declared her felt the most important aunt. I'm going to be her second mother, she announced at the hospital. Since I can't have my own, I'll pour all my love into this baby. Everyone thought it was sweet. I thought it was creepy. She started coming over every single day. She'd snatch Lily out of my arms the second she arrived. Mommy needs a break, she'd say, even when I just woken up from a full night sleep. When I try to take my baby back, she'd hold on tighter. Don't be selfish. Lily needs to bond with her aunt, too. Then the accident started. First, she gave Lily water when she was only three weeks. So I caught her with a bottle of water at Lily's Lips. Babies get thirsty, too, she said when I screamed. When I explained that water could kill a Newborn, she rolled her eyes. That's just paranoid internet Nonsense. Babies in my generation drank water and survived. Next, she put the blankets and stuffed animals in Lily's crib during her nap. I found my baby's face pressed against a teddy bear, barely able to breathe. Bridget said she was just trying to make the crib cozy. You keep her in that cold, empty box like she's in prison. When I showed her the safe sleep guidelines, she said modern mothers were too anxious about everything. She'd leave Lily on the changing table and walk away to get things. She'd put bottles in Lily's mouth and leave her alone to feed. She'd put Lily in her car seat, but not buckle the straps properly. Every time I caught her, she'd say I was overreacting. I've babysat dozens of kids. I know what I'm doing. My husband Keith didn't see the pattern. She's trying to help. She's just not up to date on current safety stuff. Be patient with her. His parents said the same thing. Bridget loves that baby. She'd never hurt her. You're being a paranoid new mother. The breaking point came when Lily was 2 months old. I had to use the bathroom and left Lily with Bridget for literally three minutes. When I came back, Bridget was feeding Lily honey from a spoon. Actual honey to a two month old baby. It's good for her immune system, Bridget said as I knocked the spoon away. Plus it'll help her sleep better. I rushed Lily to the Emergency room

Bethany had two kids of her own, twin boys who were 12. And she always talked about how important it was to blend our families properly. Jade needs to feel like this is her home too, she'd say. Hey, whenever I worried about the adjustment. What I didn't know was that the second my car left the driveway, Bethany turned my daughter into unpaid labor. Jade was responsible for all the cooking, all the cleaning, all the laundry. Bethany would sit on the couch playing on her phone while Jade scrubbed floors on her hands and knees. If Jade missed a spot, Bethany would dump a glass of juice on the floor and make her clean it again. This is how you learn to do things properly, she'd say. The boys were told they never had to lift a finger because Jade it was there to serve them. They'd throw their clothes on the floor and laugh when Jade had to pick them up. They demand snacks at midnight and Bethany would wake Jade up to make them. Part of being a good sister, Bethany would say, Jade never Told me because Bethany threatened her. Your dad is finally happy again after your mom died. Do you really want to ruin that for him? Do you want him.

So I returned her energy. My best friend and I have been tight for over 10 years. She's the kind of person who has a crisis every single week. And I mean that literally. If a guy doesn't text back after one day, she's calling me sobbing at 2:00am saying she'll die alone if she sees her ex's new girlfriend's Instagram story. Suddenly it's a full emergency requiring me to drop everything and Facetime for the next two hours. She called at midnight, during my lunch breaks, even during my work presentations and I always answer because that's what best friends do. Spend hundreds of hours talking her down from spirals only for them to resolve by themselves by the next day. But here's the thing, I'm just realising after eight years when I need support for anything serious, my best friend is suddenly too overwhelmed to handle other people's stuff. There's always a reason she can't show up. Then my dad gets diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's. I'm devastated and text my best friend about it and she responds within two minutes saying, Omg, that's so hard. I'm here for you, babe, whatever you need. So I try to call her that night because I'm sitting in my car outside my parents house crying and I can't go back inside just yet. She declines the call and text back, can we talk tomorrow? Rough day. Okay, fine. I get it. Everyone has rough days. Tomorrow comes and first thing that morning, she texts me about her tinder match who didn't text back and how she's spiraling about dying alone. I try to bring up my dad and ask if she can call. About an hour later, she finally calls and as, yeah, the whole thing with your dad sounds tough anyway, and then talks about her date for the next 45 minutes. This goes on for weeks where every single conversation starts with me trying to talk about what I'm going through. And within five minutes, it's about her again, her job, her dating life, her family being annoying. I'm starting to feel insane, like maybe I'm being selfish for wanting to talk about my dad's brain literally deteriorating. So I text her one night and say, hey, I'm really struggling and need my friend there for me to talk about my dad.

Have you seen, but how many individuals have already died because they haven't been able to get abortion? Abortion in the life of the mother can be put aside as something that needs to be considered. However, it's not always necessary. But let's talk about the main thing, because there's over 1.5 million abortions every single year that don't involve rape, incest or life in the. Yeah, 1.5 million. Yes, but let's, let's just ask you a very simple question. When, when does human life begin? When does human life, and my personal opinion is gonna start around the second trimester, a little more farther along. But let's get to this. Most individuals that are having abortions are gonna be mothers that cannot afford it. They usually have already 2 to 3 kids and a lot of time. So, so, so it's acceptable to be able to murder your young if all of a sudden you don't have the money to support them, that you can, you can murder your offspring if you're poor. So in the first couple weeks, even though it's still not fully developed, does even have a heartbeat, does even have A heartbeat development does not equal dignity. A human being is a human being regardless of the process of development that it is in, period. And so who's trying to take rights away? I actually want more human beings. Then why are you affecting the LGBT, then why are you affecting the LGBT? Well, hold on. We're talking, let, let's, let me finish on abortion. I want more human lives with, by the way, hilariously, would be more women would actually would be born cause the right to life is Paramount. You're trying to take rights away because you're okay with the massacring of little humans. Back to LGBT. It's been going throughout history, though. Abortion has been a big thing for a long time. And it affects people. So, and it hurts people. So as murder and slavery and child sacrifice. There's, that's completely different. No, it, it is murder.

When he later urged her to dress up for the show, she refused, saying it revealed too much skin. But he insisted it was a custom piece from a designer he personally hired, a dress meant to make her the star of the broadcast. So she smiled, swallowed her doubts and agreed. On recording day, the audience waited, excited to see her grand entrance. Yet the one who walked onto the stage was not her. It was the hostess, wrapped in that very dress, now ripped and pitiful. Her husband froze in disbelief, and she appeared moments later, dazzling in a completely different gown. Days earlier, she had discovered his affair with the hostess. She didn't scream or confront. She prepared something far more elegant, revenge. Before the program began, she casually told the hostess her husband bought her an extremely expensive dress, but she had gained weight and couldn't fit into it. She asked if they could swap outfits. The hostess accepted instantly. The price tag alone was irresistible. As soon as the show started, the seams burst wide open. Shockingly, the hostess ran straight into her husband's arms for help and the cameras captured every frame. Her husband shouted at the crew to shut the footage down, but suspicion had already spread across the set. The hostess apologized in a panic, and the wife graciously forgave her, at least on camera. Soon, the second segment began. The husband was tasked with cooking her a loving dish. But the moment it started, steel rods suddenly pierced through her body.

When she reached the spot she had chosen, she filled her lungs and dove beneath the surface. While exploring underwater, she suddenly spotted a small aircraft that had sunk long ago. She slipped into the cabin and found several bags. Grabbing them quickly, she shot back up to the surface. Just then, a bear wandered out of the woods and began devouring the food she had left on the shore. Fear crawled up her spine. She had no way to stop it. Things grew worse when the bear noticed a man lying not far away. She splashed the water again and again, trying to distract, but the bear didn't even glance her way. It slowly approached the man, stared at him for a moment, and then turned away calmly, as if understanding the man was no longer alive. Only then did little deer exhale and swim back to shore. She opened the bags only to find piles of money completely useless in this place. She gently moved the man to a soft patch of earth and covered him out of respect. Now she had to find a way to survive. She gathered a few pairs of glasses and used the paper bills as tin to start a small flame. The warm glow filled her with hope. Clean water became her top priority. She collected scattered bits of metal and Plastic and used them to boil lake water. When the water finally bubbled, she felt like the happiest person alive. She now had something safe to drink. Next came the search for food. She tied a string to a stick and used her earring as a makeshift hook. But the moment she caught a fish, string snapped. So she walked into the forest in search of wild fruit. After a full day and night, she finally found some, stored them in a bottle, sorted them by color, and ate them. Little by little, counting the days, she realized she had survived.

But the wife noticed that the sweater appeared too small, so she asked him to stand up and turn around. When he refused to get up, the wife suddenly began to feel anxious. No matter how she called his name, he stood frozen, completely unresponsive. Only then did she realize the network signal was poor, so she ended the call. The design on the back of the sweater was still incomplete. A little while later, the wife sensed something was off and tried video calling him again. Suddenly, a wig fell over his face. The wife immediately picked up on the strange situation, and just as she was about to confront him, the man froze once again, motionless. The villagers behind him held their breath. The wife thought the network had frozen again, so she started walking around the house in search of a better signal. After multiple failed attempts, she finally hung up the phone. Only then did everyone dare to breathe normally. It turned out that the husband had lied to his wife, telling her he was studying art in a big city, when in reality he was teaching in a remote Mountain Village. Every time his wife called, he pretended to be at a city landmark, relying entirely on the villagers to cover up the truth. But one day, while visiting a newly opened resort, the Wife noticed a notice board at the village entrance, its contents partially hidden by something. Driven by curiosity, she lifted the cover and to her shock, she saw her husband's photo posted there. She stood frozen in place before heading straight to her husband's workplace.

The man didn't say a word and he started to realize the gravity of the situation. He glanced at the man next door and suddenly it all clicked. A surge of rage coursed through him, grabbed his wife, throwing her in front of the man, hoping she would repent.

To make matters worse, a bandit appeared, frightening her back into the water. The man on the bank refused to depart. She held her breath until surfacing, gasping, still dared not emerge under his unblinking gaze. Swimming to the rear area to dress, she discovered her clothes had vanished. Terrified, she slipped beneath the surface. Again she pleaded for the man to retrieve her attire. His eyes gleamed with sudden interest. He pretended to search the foliage, though clearly nothing was there. Witnessing her desperation, the bandit conceived a scheme, retrieved a burlap sack from his steed. The woman felt momentary relief, assuming heed fashion crude covering. But he flung the sack into the current. She fumed. How could soaked fabric help? Next instant her face went ashen. The man waded into the river, advancing.

But I remained calm in the face of it all. I activated disarm mode immediately pulling every security guards gun into the air.

The phone army didn't stand a chance against that kind of firepower. They were shattered in seconds. The crowd around me cheered wildly in response. But in the next moment, a storm erupted at the center of the stadium and a massive shadow loomed on the ground. I turned and saw the steel giant eagle emerge once again. It spread its sharp claws, launching a deadly dive at me, but it missed completely. As it turned around, it froze. It saw countless versions of me forming a giant sphere with all of us firing machine guns in all directions, rolling straight toward the steel Giant Eagle. Then we mimicked its movements and Launched our attack.

All of them were skilled in martial arts. The master poured the scalding water into their cups, but none could bear the heat.

He had years of experience with the sharp sword, which hundreds had bowed down to. Even then, the boy was ready. He faced the master's attacks head on. Though young in age, his skills were sharper than many season warriors. In the end, the master broke the boy's sword, leaving him unarmed. Still, the boy didn't stop. He grabbed the master's sword with his bare hands, slid forward and landed a powerful punch that shook the master's Jaw. Then he leapt into the air, delivering another blow that hit the master's neck. He swiftly seized the sword, throwing it far away. The master barely survived, but the sword pierced into a pillar. After that, the boy showed no mercy. He punched straight into the master's chest. The master fell the victim of his own sword. He never imagined that one day he would.

Wanting her eternally tormented by guilt, though the wife now performed remorse, the husband dismissed her hollow apologies, launching himself from the ledge without hesitation. When the wife witnessed her husband's remains, a twisted smirk flickered across her lips. She hurried back into the penthouse, feverishly booting his computer to input passwords, planning to liquidate all his assets. Unexpectedly, the system required facial authentication.

So my husband threw them out. But what they said next changed everything. My parents always treated me like the family servant while my brother got everything. Growing up, I'd mow lawns while he played video games. I do laundry while he hung out with friends. When I complained, my dad would say I was being ungrateful. I left at 19 and never looked back. I met my wife in grad school. She saw how my family treated me and was horrified when I told my parents we were getting engaged at 25. They said she was beneath me, that I was making a mistake. We got married anyway, just her family there. They moved to Florida about eight years ago. Honestly, our relationship only works with distance. We text sometimes, but it's always tense. Last month, my wife and I bought our dream condo, two bedrooms downtown, everything we wanted. We were thrilled but kept it quiet from my parents. They're paying for a storage unit nearby and I knew exactly what would happen if they found out. As far as they knew, we rented a studio near my wife's office. Yesterday afternoon, I was working from home when my college buddy Ryan knocked. Behind him were my parents running like they pulled off a surprise. Ryan ran into them at target and thought it'd be nice to bring them over the moment They walked in and saw our open concept living room, the granite counters, the balcony view. My mom's smile died. She looked around slowly, face getting redder. Then she exploded. She screamed about how selfish we were, all this space and we never offered to help with. She yelled about how we've been getting along so well lately. Why would I lie? She said. I was sneaky and ungrateful, just like always. I stood there frozen. Ryan looked horrified. My mom kept going. Family helps family. You clearly don't care about us. That's when my wife came home. She walked in, saw my mom gesturing wildly, saw my face and her expression hardened. She set down her bag. Stop yelling in our home. My dad quiet until then, face bright red. Your home, he spat. You mean the home my money helped buy? The room went silent. I felt my stomach drop. I turned to face my parents. What money? My mom's angry expression shifted to something smug. She crossed her arms. We've been sending your brother $1,500 every month for eight years to help you both. We assumed he was splitting it like we asked. My wife's jaw dropped. I couldn't breathe. Eight years, $1,500 a month. That's $144,000. My brother bought a boat last year. He went to Japan twice. He drives a Tesla. And I'm standing in my first home that we scraped together for, learning he pocketed money meant for both of us. My hands shook. As I called my brother on speaker.

But when she peered out again, her mother's boyfriend had already fallen overboard and her mother was nowhere to be found. Terrified, she hid back in the cabin. The pirates opened the door and entered the cabin. She curled up in a corner. Fortunately, the pirates glanced around and left. She breathed a sigh of relief.

She grabbed the fire extinguisher and fought the he's all night. Though the fire was extinguished, the ship was badly damaged. Huddled in the corner, she picked up a photo and discovered to her horror that her mother's new boyfriend was part of the pirate crew. That had boarded the ship the night before. She resolved to find and rescue her mother.

The reason was clear. Mr Han wasn't some creep. He was actually searching for a hidden camera. After checking carefully, he discovered that the camera had been placed there by the art teacher. Mr Han went to confront him, but just then, loud screams came from inside. Mr Han was never the type to care about consequence. In the past, he had broken three ribs of his own boss during an argument. That fight cost him his job as a boxing coach. And later, he became the school's PE teacher. On his very first day, he clashed with some students. Two girls kept staring at him, whispering that his strong build made him look more like a gangster than a teacher. They rejected Mr Han's apology and instead admired the charming art teacher. On paper, Han was a PE teacher, but secretly he was hired to collect debts. Still, he never raised his hand against young students. He decided to start with the smallest debt, which belonged to a girl named Elena. Soon after, he saw Elena climbing over the school wall to escape. He followed her and was shocked when she entered a nightclub. Inside, someone tried to harass her. Han pushed the guy aside and grabbed Elena's hand to pull her out. A dangerous thug appeared, but even he went silent. After seeing Han's intimidating presence outside the club, Han finally Learned the truth. Elena was looking for her missing best friend. After her parents passed away, the friend was forced to work in that same club, and then she disappeared. That night, Han dropped Elena home, promised to help find her friend, and warned her never to go to such places again. Just as they were near the house, a car slowly passed by. The strange shadow of its headlights looked suspicious. Elena ignored it. But when the car stopped, she felt something was wrong. Meanwhile, Han noticed Elena's phone had fallen in the car. He turned back to return it. But at the bridge, he saw a man in black clothes carrying Elena away. The kidnapper escaped, but Han rushed Elena straight to the hospital. Later, he grew angry at the careless police investigation. As he thought deeply, one detail clicked. Smell of cigarettes had been coming from the school restroom. Furious, he stormed inside and caught three delinquent girls. They denied smoking, but Han checked every stall. That's when the shocking truth appeared. Again, a hidden camera was installed.

The ornament happened to shatter the glass floor below. The people dancing on it had no clue what was coming. What they didn't know was that the load bearing rivets had come loose too. And this whole chain of accidents just needed one spark. This deadly coin that was about to set everything off because it was about to trigger a catastrophe. The falling coin jammed right into the fan blades. Pressure from the high speed rotation sent it flying, piercing straight through a gas pipe. The leaked gas seeped through the ventilation system into the ballroom where the party was happening. What seemed like random events were actually all connected. Then the disaster that had been building finally erupted. Dozens of people plummeted from the heights, raining down onto the ground below. Falling from that height, they could only become a mist of blood. Some people thought they could cheat death. Even when they fought desperately to survive, fate had already sealed their doom. The ballroom descended into total chaos. The stampeding crowd knocked over a VAT of oil and people caught fire. An even bigger crisis was brewing. The burning woman ignited the leaked gas. In the explosion, that coin went flying again. Flames consumed the entire ballroom. Although the blast didn't completely destroy the hall, people still rushed frantically toward the exits. Common sense says that when there's a fire, The stairwell is your best escape route. But that wasn't the case here. The stairwell wall suddenly collapsed, and countless people fell with them. Since the stairs were gone, the elevator became the only option. But people ignored the weight limit and kept cramming in. A woman had just reached the door when an old man shoved her aside. Just as the old man was halfway through stepping in, disaster struck. The terrified woman realized she had to take matters into her own hands. She rushed back into the hall, looking for a way out. But as everyone surged to one side, the floor started tilting. Ceiling cracked open. Sure enough, the floor gave way, too. Luckily, the woman caught on in time. With quick reflexes, she climbed onto a stable platform. But another person wasn't so lucky. They fell straight onto the glass. Though the glass hadn't shattered yet. It only takes one last straw to break. When would the piano dangling overhead come crashing down? It turned out that lodged in the swaying chandelier above was that coin that had been blown away in the explosion. That's right. This coin of death was the key to everything. When it stopped spinning, the ending was already written. And that boy who'd escaped down the stairs, his final moment had arrived, too. The ballroom finally couldn't take it anymore and began collapsing entirely. The woman survived. For now. The boy hiding in the cabinet had made it, too. But the Crisis wasn't over. The woman had just pulled the boy out when the walls around them started crumbling. Nowhere left to go. She could only leap down. Then the entire hall came crashing down. By sheer luck, her wedding ring caught between two steel beams. But hanging thousands of feet in the air. How long could she hold on? In desperation, her fingers began to break, which meant death was coming for her.

Then I jumped into the sea to spear fish, thinking everything was under control. Little did I know this moment would make me regret it for the rest of my life. When the guy woke up and found his goggles gone, he flew into a rage and grabbed a spear ready to sink me. My wife grabbed the spear to stop him, but she was too weak. She couldn't hold it and even tore her clothes in the struggle. Seeing that, the guy didn't hesitate when I came back full of fish and tossed the goggles to him, he should have been angry, but instead he seemed oddly pleased. I felt something was off, but I didn't think too much of it and proudly showed off my prize, just wanting to fill my stomach. Then I noticed my wife's eyes darting away and my chest tightened. He didn't say a word and I started to realize the seriousness of the situation. I looked back at the guy next door and suddenly understood. Rage surged through me. I grabbed her and threw her in front of the guy, hoping she'd repent. But minutes later, my shock, she and the guy were chillingly dancing together like nothing had happened. Seeing that, I turned green with anger. I couldn't stand it. I swore to myself they'd Pay for this. So I smashed a glass bottle, ground down the bottom, glued it to the neck, softened a plastic bottle over a flame, cut it open and sealed the mouth with black rubber, made a makeshift diving mask. I couldn't wait and dove in. Underwater was clearer than I expected. Excited. I planned to spear a few big fish to spite them. But then I spotted a sunken dinghy. It only had a small hole, fixable. My mind lit up. Pair that boat and I could get off this island. I abandoned the fishing idea, took off the goggles and started hauling the boat. Walking in water is brutal. Pulling a boat heavier than me nearly exhausted me. I gasped for air, kept going, terrified the tide would wash it away. Finally, I dragged the dinghy up onto shore. The guy saw it and seemed to realize this might be our way out. He ran over to help, but I barked at him to stop. He'd humiliated me before. Now he had the nerve to cozy up to me. No way. For days, I worked on the boat, dreaming of leaving the island. Then my wife came to apologize, saying she did.

Mark rushes over from behind, grabbing the woman and saving her from harm to find the real holy grail. Mark picks up another shabby cup and scoop some water from the basin, but he doesn't drink it directly. Instead, he places the cup filled with holy water at the cave entrance, waiting for someone destined to drink it. Little did he know he would wait 50 years. By then, the cave had already been filled with sand. Only the cup of holy water remained standing. A man, thirsty after two years, was about to grab it, but the cup suddenly emitted a dazzling light. The next second, the fat man died instantly. Seeing his friend turn into sand, Jack didn't hesitate for long. He bravely walked toward the Holy Grail, thinking it was better to take a risk than to die of thirst. He then cupped the Holy Grail in His hands. Strangely, nothing happened to him.

Then he quickly escaped on a motorcycle. But the man in the car was busy waving his hands, trying to drive away the bees. As the bomb timer ticked closer, the man became more and more frustrated. He suddenly made a sharp drift and stopped the car on the side of the road. Only 14 seconds were left. The man, not knowing anything, was still fighting with the bees. One bee landed on the car. The man took off his shoe, ready to give it a fatal hit. From afar, the killer thought his plan had worked. But to his surprise, the man standing by the car was totally unharmed. The man, still clueless, proudly thought it was because of his own strength. Helpless, the killer had to continue his assassination the next day. He fired several shots at the man's car. Finally, one bullet hit the gas tank. Gasoline sprayed out instantly. But the man, still unaware, kept driving. While talking on the phone, picked up the lighter. But it was broken, so he casually threw it out of the car. Unexpectedly, the gasoline on the ground caught fire. The unlucky killer drove straight into the flames. Almost roasted alive, he quickly jumped out of the car. The Jeep then crashed off the cliff. The killer never thought this mission would be so hard. Meanwhile, the man kept driving the leaking car. The boss, angry at the failure, decided to Send the top assassin. Soon, the man drove into a gas station. The top assassin was already following him. He lifted his arm and a sharp dagger instantly popped out. He showed the scars on his arm, proving his victories. For him, this mission was nothing. But the man still had no idea of the danger. Gas station workers saw the small hole in the car and simply plugged it with chewing gum. The man stood nearby, using an air gun to blow dust off his head. He didn't know the assassin had taken out a special drug. The assassin quietly approached from behind. But the drug was blown away by the air gun and flew straight into the assassin's mouth. Once again, the lucky man escaped. A few hours later, the assassin woke up. Unfortunately, he triggered the daggers mechanism. The top assassin was dead. The boss realized the problem was serious. He sent five agents and they finally caught the man. They even arranged guards to watch him. Unexpectedly, the man suddenly burst out with strength. He broke the ropes in an instant and jumped out the window. Oh! Oh jeez! But there were also heavy guards outside. The man raised his hands to surrender. Unexpectedly, that move worked out perfectly and he escaped.

The entire house was laced with traps, just waiting for those two thieves to take the bait. As night fell, they appeared right on schedule. I aimed my gun at the thieves growing through the hole. What? What? He flew into a rage and ordered his partner to grab me. He peered inside to look. Hello? The furious thief decided to split up. The leader charged straight for the front door. He stumbled up the stairs unaware the doorknob had been heated, red hot. The subordinate approached the back door. He took one step and slid straight down the stairs. Inside, the house was pitch black. Just as he tugged the light switch cord, a sound came from above his head. He looked up. When he woke up, a bright red Mark was branded on his face. The leader circled to the side door. After repeatedly checking the handle was safe, he pushed to enter, only to fire erupted from his head. He plunged face first into the snow. When he pulled his head out, he was completely bald. Meanwhile, the younger brother struggled up the stairs. Both shoes stuck to the tar. His socks stuck, too.

The furious leader charged straight at me with the instant he looked up, heads up.

Then all of a sudden they wanted me again. After I passed the bar exam to become a lawyer. I texted my family the date and time of my swearing and ceremony. My dad replied saying he couldn't make it because my brother Silas had a golf tournament at the same day. My mom said she'd be at the tournament too. Silas sent a laughing emoji and wrote, it's just a ceremony. You already passed. We'll celebrate later. I stared at my phone and typed back, understood. The ceremony was beautiful and I sat there in a room full of new lawyers with their families cheering and taking pictures. I was alone. The woman next to me had her entire extended family there and they kept apologizing for being too loud. I told them it was fine and tried not to cry. Afterwards, the law firm I joined took photos of all the new associates for their website and newsletter. I smiled in my professional headshot and pretended I wasn't heartbroken. My boss pulled me aside and said, where's your family? I wanted to meet them. I said they couldn't make it. And he looked confused but didn't push. I started working criminal defense and I was good at it, really good. I won cases that senior partners said were unwinnable. I worked 80 hour weeks and built a reputation. My family never asked about my Work. At Thanksgiving, my dad spent an hour talking about Silas's promotion at his sales job. And when I mentioned I'd won a major case, he said, that's nice and change the object. Silas asked if I was dating anyone. And when I said I was too busy with work, he said, you're always going to be too busy. That's your problem. My mom nodded and said, he's right. You need balance. I said, I have balance. I'm building a career. My dad laughed and said, Silas has a career and still makes time for family. Maybe you should take notes. On Christmas, my dad gave Silas an expensive watch and gave me a gift card to target. When I opened it, Silas smirked and said, at least you can buy yourself something nice. I left early and my mom texted me later saying I'd ruined Christmas by being dramatic. I stopped going to family dinners. After that, my dad would text saying I was being distant and I needed to make more effort. Didn't respond. My mom called once and said, your father is hurt that you won't come around anymore. Family is supposed to forgive. I said, family is supposed to show up and hung up. Six months after my swearing in ceremony, I got a call from my dad at 2 in the morning. He said, Silas has been arrested. You need to come to the police station right now. I was exhausted from a long day. In court. But I got dressed and drove 40 minutes to the station. Silas had gotten into a bar fight and assaulted someone badly enough to send them to the hospital. The charges were aggravated assault and he was looking at serious prison time. My dad grabbed my arm when I walked in and said, you have to fix this. You're a lawyer. You can make this go away. I said, I'm a criminal defense attorney. I don't make things go away. I defend people in court. He said, so defend him. He's your brother. I looked at Silas sitting in the holding cell and he wouldn't even look at me. My dad said, we're family. You owe us this. I said, I owe you this. Where were you six months ago when I got sworn in? My dad said, this is.
