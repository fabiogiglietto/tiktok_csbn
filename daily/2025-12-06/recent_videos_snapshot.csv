She only told Sid to bring in Havelock as fast as possible. She said. Havelock used a backup server to break into the CIA database. He took a classified file called File 6. What is Archive 6? It's our playbook. It's an inventory of every enemy we've had terminated with lethal action under the at water protocol, including pending and current targets. So he's coming after the agency. At that moment, my son Luke and his classmate were inside a small cabin. They left town before the alert went out, so they had no idea about the escaped inmates or the transport plane that Chanja. They tried to head home. They opened the trunk and found an injured inmate inside. Jesus. The man stayed unconscious. Luke and the girl took care of him. She thought he was just an unlucky hunter hurt in the woods. Havelock called the director. The sound of his voice put her on edge. Avloc said he sent her a link. It worked as a dead switch. If anything happened to him, file 6 would go public instantly. He finished his message and ended the call. Soon after, I received a walkie talkie. Are you gonna make the trade? Sent by him. My decision was set. I took the officer posing as Old Black and went to the meeting spot. I want you to follow The pipeline for the north and then. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You said Risor, 4:52? Yes. And now I'm saying follow the pipeline for the north. Havlock told me to keep walking forward. Right then the air around me tightened. You're not here, are you? Nope. I never claimed I would be Frank. Fuck, it's a diversion. Okay. We moved toward the transport vehicle, but Havelock had already reached it. First, he took what he wanted. We were too late. Sid found a case in the car. It was something Havelock left for me. I stared at the case. A few dark stains glimmered under the dim light. The story stopped right there.

Quería un lugar tranquilo donde poder sanar y encontrar paz. Pronto contrató algunos trabajadores para arreglarla, pero un descuido casi hace que la casa se derrumbe. Todos se quedaron paralizados frente a los escombros, pero ann sorprendió a todos con una sonrisa. Dijo que aquella casa en ruinas le recordaba su propio corazón destrozado. Reconstruirla era agotador y difícil, pero al menos le ayudaba a olvidar el dolor por un tiempo. Un día, ann vio un anciano en el balcón sosteniendo un ramo de flores. Ella le saludó con la mano, pero él no respondió porque estaba rindiendo homenaje a su esposa fallecida. En ese momento, ann comprendió que el amor también puede ser así de hermoso. No pudo evitar preguntarse por qué su propio amor era tan frágil. A dónde se fue el amor que debería haber sido suyo. An se llevaba muy bien con sus vecinos y hasta fue invitada a una pequeña reunión. Allí volvió a encontrarse con la mujer que ya conocía. Al notar que an estaba herida por amor, la mujer contó su propia historia y le aconsejó que nunca perdiera la pasión, que eso es lo que mantiene vivo el amor. Poco a poco, el corazón de ann comenzó a sanar y volvió a confiar de nuevo. Un día, una serpiente entró en la casa, asustando a ann lo suficiente como para llamar a los vecinos. Revisaron cada rincón, pero no pudieron encontrarla por ningún lado Su recién recuperada calma se rompió otra vez y sintió que todo el mundo estaba en su contra. Sus vecinos tranquilizaron diciéndole que no podía perder la esperanza. Si quería ser feliz esa casa, tenía que ser valiente y perseguir lo que deseaba. Esas palabras le dieron un gran impulso de ánimo y siguió arreglando la casa mientras compraba materiales. En el pueblo, un grupo de niños traviesos comenzó a molestarla para deshacerse de ellos. An fingió que un extraño era su novio. Incluso le besó en la mejilla y así, casi sin darse cuenta, una dulce historia empezó a florecer. Salieron a pasear en coche juntos, hablaron durante horas, se miraron con ternura y finalmente se enamoraron. Después de una noche maravillosa, acordaron verse la semana siguiente. Han pasado todos los días imaginando ese encuentro, una visita inesperada de una amiga arruinó todos sus planes. Aunque perdió su cita con él, no se arrepintió, porque la amistad también era muy importante para ella. Unos días después, mientras caminaba por la montaña, un vecino le dio unos binoculares para mirar a lo lejos. A través de ellos vio a su novio, pero cuando notó que cal parecía a punto de irse, se puso muy nerviosa. Corrió por la pendiente gritando. Su nombre incluso se cayó, pero aún así fue demasiado lenta. Desesperada, corrió tras el coche gritando lo más fuerte que pudo, pero solo pudo verlo alejarse poco a poco y así se volvieron a Separar otra vez

In Florida, a man witnessed something unbelievable. While withdrawing cash from an ATM, the machine suddenly malfunctioned and started spitting out money non stop, with a total of $1.2 million flooding out. At first, the man was stunned by what he saw, but once he realized something was seriously wrong, he immediately called the police and notified the bank staff. However, when the bank employees arrived and counted the cash, they confirmed the ATM had dispensed $1.2 million, but after double checking, they discovered $500 was missing. The bank believes the man may have hidden the missing $500 during the chaos and is demanding that he return the money and also cover the cost of repairing the ATM and the staff's lost work time, totaling $10,000. According to the bank's lawsuit, the man's actions constitute illegal possession, taking extra money without any legal right to it. But the man insists he never intentionally took any extra cash. He says the whole situation was caused by the ATM malfunction and he reported it to authorities as quickly as possible. Do you think the man should be held responsible for the costs?

Realizing he can eat whatever he wanted without getting sick, he set a world record eating 16 chandeliers, eight bicycles, and even an entire Cessna airplane. Next is the world's biggest diamond. A miner named Frederick Wells discovered a massive crystal like looking rock while working underground. He then took the strange looking rock to his manager to be looked at. After examining the rock, his manager realized it was a 3,106 karat diamond. Today, experts estimate that it's worth a whopping $400 million.

He even modified his cap, spray painting a fake Nike logo onto it. Only with these altered clothes could he hope to slip out with without being recognized. Next, while helping a delivery truck driver inspect the vehicle, he quietly measured the distance between two steel beams beneath the chassis. Later, he crafted a wooden plank with the exact dimensions, just wide enough for him to lie on. He knew that the truck's next delivery run would be his best chance to escape. At the moment the cargo was unloaded, he act. Using the roar of the engine as cover, Jimmy grabbed the plank and rolled underneath the truck, wedging it firmly between the two steel beams. If he could stay hidden on that board, he just might slip through the upcoming security checkpoint unnoticed. The engine was so loud that the driver didn't sense a thing. At the prison gate, guards inspected the underside of the truck with mirror. Thanks to the concealed board, Jimmy remained invisible. Only 500 meters outside the prison, the truck suddenly stopped. Fortunately, it wasn't because Jimmy had been discovered. The driver simply needed to use the restroom. But Jimmy didn't bolt. Instead, he silently slid out from under the chassis and Hid behind the wheel. Then, just as the driver was about to climb back into the truck, Jimmy made his move and sprinted away.

De repente tuvo una idea audaz. Observó que el guardia no estaba prestando atención aquí. Silenciosamente, colocó la cuchara en la suela del zapato y la frotó hacia adelante y hacia atrás hasta que se ensució. Luego llamó al guardia indicando que su cuchara estaba sucia y necesitaba una nueva. Su compañero también entendió de inmediato lo que quería decir y hizo la misma solicitud. El guardia no tuvo ninguna sospecha y accedió a su petición. Sin embargo, fue este descuido suyo lo que lograría una de las fugas más grandes de la historia. Cuando los dos llegaron a la recepción, el compañero deliberadamente habló con el guardia para distraer su atención. El hombre rápidamente aprovechó la oportunidad para tomar la nueva cuchara. Nadie se dio cuenta que había tomado una cuchara extra. Pero solo con una cuchara es difícil escapar. Al día siguiente, encontró a un prisionero veterano para que le ayudara a conseguir algunos suministros adicionales. Una vez que todo estuvo listo, el hombre primero partió la cuchara en dos, luego desmontó la Lima de uñas. Después molió una moneda hasta convertirla en polvo, luego encendió un fósforo y conectó el mango de la cuchara con la Lima. Pronto logró fabricar una nueva herramienta. Pidió a su compañero que observara al guardia y comenzó a usar la nueva herramienta para dañar la ventilación de su celda. En ese momento, el guardia apareció repentinamente y su amigo, que estaba durmiendo, no se dio cuenta. Afortunadamente Otro prisionero negro deliberadamente habló con el guardia para que se despertara rápidamente. Tomó una taza de la mesa y golpeó las rejas. Afortunadamente, Jack fue alerta y escuchó los pasos del guardia. Se apresuró a cubrir el agujero con algo. Cuando el guardia se fue, Jack le recordó a su compañero que debía avisarle a tiempo y luego continuó perforando la pared. Pero después de perforar un rato, descubrió que la reja de la ventilación tenía un pestillo que bloqueaba el paso. Necesitaba encontrar una herramienta para sacarlo al día siguiente. En el camino a la carpintería, mientras el guardia no miraba, vació todos los restos de tierra que había sacado de sus bolsillos. Luego tomó una pieza de hierro. Pero para regresar a su celda tenían que pasar por un detector de metales. Esto no fue problema para el hombre. Cuando el guardia revisó el, deliberadamente sacó el trozo de hierro, indicando que era para colgar su ropa. Finalmente, el guardia se lo confiscó, pero en realidad la había escondido otro en la suela de su zapato. El hombre colocó el trozo de hierro en el pestillo. Luego Jack lo abrió con el pie. Después desmontó la reja de hierro. Luego metió la cabeza fuera y descubrió que estaba conectado a varios tubos. Para escapar necesitaba planificar bien, así que Jack consiguió pintura y periódicos. Dibujó la apariencia de la reja de ventilación y luego tapó el agujero con algo.

Él estaba jugando a las cartas con unos amigos, presenciando este desastre en plena noche, pero su familia aún dormida probablemente no lo sabía. Además, su hija tenía el hábito de correr por la mañana. Tenía que llegar a casa antes del amanecer.

Al llegar a la estación de tren, quiso regresar a casa por las vías del tren, pero aquí encontró un tren. Las vías y el tren estaban llenos de cadáveres mientras caminaba.

Jack sabía que estaban pidiendo ayuda. Se acercó al vagón y explicó a los sobrevivientes que solo había venido solo, que no tenía la capacidad de rescatarlos, pero la gente en el vagón no le escuchaba. Jack se quitó la mochila, pero al abrirla descubrió que dentro había una pistola.

Al entrar, vio el cadáver de un perro extraño, el Perro llevaba un casco y tenía el cuerpo atado con muchas bolsas de plástico. Parecía que alguien lo había usado para hacer pruebas. Justo al entrar al pasillo escuchó el sonido de un martillo golpeando algo. Al subir vio a varias personas forzando una cerradura. Cuando llegó a su puerta descubrió que no estaba cerrada con llave. Llamó a su hija varias veces pero no hubo respuesta. Buscó por toda la casa pero no encontró a nadie. Mirando la foto de su hija, jack se sintió muy arrepentido. Anoche no debería haber salido.

The clerk, clearly smitten, told her it was free. She blinked in surprise, accepted the cone, and thanked him warmly. The moment she walked out, the manager glared at the clerk. How are you going to cover that? He snapped. The clerk sheepishly dumped his entire tip jar on the counter, earning himself a loud idiot from his boss. But the next morning, everything changed. The woman had somehow turned into a man. Still half asleep, he walked into the bathroom and immediately sensed something was wrong. He looked down, froze, then screamed, sprinting to the mirror. The reflection staring back at him shocked him so badly that he fainted on the spot. Moments later, he called a friend for help, and she rushed him home. Feeling sweaty and convinced he smelled terrible, he drenched himself in perfume until the whole room reeked. When his best friend asked what was going on, he reluctantly revealed his new body. She gasped, then immediately summoned more friends to see for themselves. One by one, they stared at him in disbelief, right before breaking into a chaotic pillow fight. Surrounded and bombarded, something inside him snapped. He swung back with real force. One punch knocked a friend flat. Another blow sent someone crashing straight into the wall. He smiled nervously at the last girl, terrifying her, then accidentally punched her clean through the wall as his friends Lay unconscious on the ground, he finally realized he had no control over his new strength. Later, he returned to the same ice cream shop, nervously eating a cone. This time, the clerk wasn't charmed. He looked absolutely disgusted as the man clumsily licked ice cream off his hand. When he asked the price, the clerk replied coldly, nine dollars. Confused why his charm wasn't working, he pressed again, only for the clerk to grab him by the throat. Terrified, he paid instantly. Outside, he and his friend walked down the street when a stranger began harassing her. Furious, he stepped in and slapped the man across the face. The stranger staggered back, then threatened him, challenging him to take it outside. And just as he squared up for the fight.

Panicking, Cosrow raced home and tore through drawers, looking for anything that could help.

His ability had always allowed him to take on the properties of whatever he touched, rewriting the very structure of his body. Yet this time, the transformation was unstoppable. The truth hit him hard. During a recent mission, he had touched the ancient obelisk everyone was searching for.

I asked if anyone considered that I might be suffering, too. He called me a homophobe and hung up. My brother Daniel's the only one who gets it. He texted me at midnight. You're allowed to grieve. Your marriage dying. That's not bigotry. That's being human. Everyone else is performing. My sister in law posted on Facebook that I'm the exact reason LGBTQ people stay closeted, because of unsupportive spouses who make everything about themselves. 43 people liked it. My own mother commented, disappointed in how you're handling this. My phone's been exploding with articles. How to be an ally when your spouse comes out, processing divorce with Grace and support. Why? Your pain doesn't invalidate their truth. I'm not mad she's gay. I'm destroyed. That for 20 years, while I was falling asleep thinking about how lucky I was to have her, she was counting down the days until the kids turned 18 and she could finally leave. Tuesday afternoon, I come home early from work because I forgot my laptop. There's a silver Subaru in my driveway I don't recognize. I walk in, and Stephanie's introducing this woman named Savannah to our daughter via Facetime. Haley's crying happy tears, saying she's so glad mom finally found someone who makes her happy. Savannah's moving into our guest room. Not our house, the house I'm still paying the mortgage on. Just typically into one of our four bedrooms. Like I'm supposed to be fine. With this new roommate situation, I asked Stephanie if she was serious. She said Savannah doesn't have anywhere else to go right now, and it's not like we're using that room anyway. I'm staying at a La Quinta Inn near the airport. It smells like cigarettes and the Wi-Fi barely works. Haley texted me this morning asking when I'm coming home because this is ridiculous and embarrassing. She has friends asking why her dad moved out the second her mom came out. Connor sent me a Bill split request on Venmo for his textbooks with the note, since you're not contributing to the household anymore. I paid for his entire college tuition, all four years, up front. My wife moved her girlfriend into my house six days after ending our marriage at Olive Garden.

Back in high school, this guy named Brandon made my life absolute hell. For two years straight, he would knock my books out of my hands, trip me in the hallway, and steal my lunch money while laughing with his buddies. The worst part was, we used to be actual friends in middle school before he decided being popular was more important. He started hanging with the jocks, and suddenly I was his favorite target. Every single day, he found new ways to embarrass me. Once he poured chocolate milk on my white shirt right before my presentation in English class. Another time, he took my gym clothes and threw them in the toilet. Teachers never did anything because his dad donated money to the school. I spent those two years just trying to survive and stay invisible. After graduation, I moved three hours away for college and never looked back at all. Contact with everyone from that town started fresh. Made real friends. Got my degree in accounting. Life was actually good for once. Then last month, I was visiting my parents for Thanksgiving weekend. My mom wanted to order pizza for dinner because she was too tired to cook. She pulled up this app and ordered from the local pizza place. When the doorbell rang 30 minutes later, I opened it without thinking. Standing there in a greasy pizza delivery uniform holding our pepperoni and cheese was Brandon His face went pale when he recognized me. I just stood there frozen. He looked rough. His hair was thinning, he had bags under his eyes, and that confident smirk he always wore was completely gone. Hey, man, he said quietly, handing me the pizza boxes, that'll be 23 50. I could tell he was praying I wouldn't say anything. His hands were actually shaking a little as he held out the card reader. For a second I almost felt bad, but then I remembered the chocolate milk, the toilet, gym clothes, the two years of constant humiliation. So I pulled out my wallet and handed him a hundred dollar Bill. Keep the change, I said, loudly enough for my mom to hear from the kitchen. His eye

I was about to lose it when a flight attendant came over. But instead of kicking the kid out of my seat, she took me straight to first class. At that moment, Ella, a CEO, was being hit on by some balding creep. She grabbed me and pulled me into the seat next to her, and the guy finally backed off. The whole flight, Ella kept her head buried in work while I goofed around with the reclining seat like a kid having a blast and trying to get her attention. But this hard nosed executive never would have dreamed that the guy sitting next to her would completely change her life. Right then, the plane suddenly hit severe turbulence. The cabin started shaking violently and everyone instantly panicked, even the flight attendants. As the shaking got worse and worse, the whole plane went pitch black. Ella instinctively grabbed my hand. I didn't pull away. I was incredibly tense. So tense I couldn't speak. So tense I was afraid to breathe. Eventually the plane landed safely. As I watched Ella gathering her things and getting ready to leave.

Mi esposa corrió a la sala y las luces se encendieron. De inmediato vi aquel desconocido. La sangre brotaba de su ojo. Mis manos aún temblaban. Cuando la policía llegó a la escena, confirmaron que el intruso era un fugitivo llamado Freddy. Me dijeron que no me preocupara, que claramente era defensa propia. Para cerrar el caso, necesitaba ir a la comisaría a declarar. Sentado en el asiento trasero del coche patrulla, no podía creer que realmente había matado a alguien. Al volver a casa, mi esposa y yo nos derrumbamos en el suelo sin saber qué hacer. Finalmente, empezamos a limpiar la sangre. A la mañana siguiente, todo el pueblo sabía lo que había pasado. El sheriff me dijo que el intruso sería enterrado al día siguiente. No podía evitar preguntarme si ese hombre tenía familia. El sheriff dijo que tenía un padre cumpliendo condena, pero el problema era que su padre sería liberado hoy. Eso me hizo sentir inquieto, preocupado por una posible venganza de su padre. Cambié todas las cerraduras de la casa por cerraduras pesadas, pero después de recibir una llamada de un número desconocido, me puse muy nervioso. La persona al otro lado no dijo ni una palabra. Estaba seguro de que era el padre del muerto. Por miedo, no dormí en toda la noche. Me quedé sentado en la sala en máxima alerta. A La mañana siguiente, decidí ir al cementerio a ver la tumba de Freddy. Cuando me senté en el coche, un anciano apareció de repente junto a la ventana. Sabía que sin duda era el padre de Freddy, recién salido de prisión y lo que dijo después me aterrorizó. Inmediatamente conduje hasta la escuela para recoger a mi hijo y fui directamente al sheriff rogándole que arrestara a ese hombre. Pero el sheriff dijo que sin pruebas no podía hacer nada. Después de salir de la comisaría, llevé a mi esposa y a mi hijo a casa, pero al llegar a la puerta descubrí que la cerradura había sido forzada. Preso del pánico, le dije a mi esposa que llevara a nuestro hijo a la comisaría mientras yo sacaba una herramienta del maletero y entraba a revisar la casa. Al principio no había nadie, pero cuando entré en la habitación de mi hijo, encontré una bala en el suelo. Siguiendo el rastro, descubrí un peluche con un ojo arrancado y luego otra bala y otra más. Policía llegó rápidamente. Ahora que había pruebas, asignaron agentes encubiertos para protegernos y dejaron a un oficial dentro de la casa, pero aún así no podía dormir. Bajé a tomar un vaso de leche. Cuando regresé al dormitorio, el padre estaba de pie junto a la cama de mi hijo. Cuando escuché ruidos extraños. Otra vez, bajé nuevamente a revisar la entrada al ático. Estaba completamente abierta. Kevin golpeé la puerta del dormitorio de mi Hijo con todas mis fuerzas. Cuando entré, el anciano ya había escapado por la ventana, pero debido a la fuerte lluvia, los oficiales que buscaban afuera no pudieron encontrar su rastro. A la mañana siguiente recibí una llamada del sheriff. Dijo que habían capturado al anciano y que estaban por enviarlo a prisión. Me sentí aliviado, creyendo que el peligro había pasado. Fui emocionado a la comisaría, pero después de terminar mi declaración noté los carteles de se busca en la pared. Cuando vi el nombre de Freddy, me acerqué a mirar con atención. Para mi sorpresa, ese no era el hombre al que maté aquella noche. Mostré el cartel al sheriff y le pregunté, pero él insistió en que ese era el hombre que yo había disparado. Antes de que pudiera aclararlo, el sheriff me echó apresuradamente de la comisaría, pero yo sabía que no estaba confundido, así que esa tarde regresé a pedir más información justo entonces y al sheriff y a sus hombres metiendo al anciano en un coche. Pero no había dicho el sheriff que ya lo habían enviado a prisión. Pensándolo bien, conduje y lo seguí. Ellos fueron hacia las vías del tren y le inyectaron un sedante al anciano. Luego lo colocaron sobre las vías, incluso escenificando la escena para que pareciera que se había desmayado borracho allí. Al presenciar todo esto, quedé completamente atónito. Si yo no había matado a Freddy, ¿por qué querían incriminarme? Y por qué querían deshacerse del padre de Freddy, antes de que pudiera entenderlo, oí el tren acercándose. Después de dudar un momento, tomé una decisión, debía descubrir la verdad, así que corrí para salvar al anciano

Me di cuenta de que si el destino me dejó sobrevivir, entonces debía empezar de nuevo. Primero cambié mi imagen y también mi peinado. Iba hacia la escuela, pero el conductor se detuvo muy lejos de la entrada.

And just cause there aren't a lot of cars on the road doesn't mean there ain't other things on the road. You hit a cow going 100, this is coming apart. You with it? Keep it under 80. Yes, ma'am. Tell your husband thank you for what he does. Wait, why did you say that? Why would you thank him? I put the food on my table too, but I don't grow it. This is cattle country, ma'am. We know what it takes to put a steak on the plate around here. How the hell did you find me here? Uh, put a tag in your wallet. You did what? Air tag. It's a GPS tracker. Just, uh, you know, if you wandered off With some cowgirl I could find you, kill her and then castrate you. I can't help it. I'm a romantic, honey. I promise you this is not a place for you. This isn't camp by a stream. This is suffering and survive. You will hate it here. Well, that's why I got us a hotel and I'm a Marriott honey. I cannot leave the boys and go sit in an air conditioned hotel room. Sweet baby, we got a sweet. Okay, do you understand how this makes me look? I can't be held up in town while the boys are doing work. One night, maybe two. Hi. So, um, I'm kidnapping him for a couple of nights in exchange next weekend I'm gonna fly out boyfriends, girlfriends, same hotel, same room, drinks will be on me. You have a deal? Yeah, you got a deal? Fuck yeah. Where's this Dale? Been on my life. Go pack your suitcase, cowboy. I'm not leaving him here alone. Don't think you got a choice, boss. All we're doing is walking through pairs, boss. If we can't do that without no supervision and we probably have to find something else to do anyway. Yeah, your mind? You're a wagon boss till I get back.

La dueña de la empresa de asesinos estaba muy contenta. Revisó la lista de asesinos de su compañía y eligió a uno de los más expertos. Podía alcanzar a cualquiera 2 000m. Este asesino acababa de completar su última misión cuando pronto recibió una nueva orden de su jefa. Pero al ver la foto del hombre, rechazó el trabajo porque el hombre en la foto no era cualquiera, era un famoso asesino profesional. Durante un chequeo médico, el doctor le dijo que tenía una enfermedad rara e incurable. Como asesino profesional, su primer pensamiento fue suicidarse, pero en el momento de levantar el arma, pensó en su novia y abandonó la idea porque el suicidio no estaba cubierto por el seguro y ella no recibiría la enorme indemnización. Entonces acudió a su jefa esperando emitir la orden de asesinato, pero ella se negó. Ben fue entonces a otra empresa de asesinos. Esta vez finalmente consiguió lo que quería, moriría después de la medianoche de esa noche. Ben tuvo una cita con su novia. Al terminar, rompió con ella. Luego Ben regresó a su casa esperando en silencio la llegada de la muerte. En ese momento, el doctor llamó a Ben. No le interesaba hablar y estaba a punto de colgar cuando el doctor dijo que había habido un error en el diagnóstico. Resultó que Ben no estaba enfermo.

And in order to continue the civilization of his higher intelligent race, as an engineer, he decided to create the miracle of life on this planet. So he did not hesitate to drink the black water prepared in the cup. Along with the drastic changes in his body, his jeans began to break down. And then the engineer fell heavily on the ground and his body was gradually corroded. Finally, the engineer's blood and flesh and water merged into one, covering the natural environment, and life on earth was born. Many centuries later, humans have developed a high degree of civilization. In order to be able to find their creator race, some people spend a lot of money to build a huge spaceship. After many years of sleeping in the dormant room, they finally found the creator's planet. But now it has changed dramatically. The creator race that humans have been thinking about is dead. Until this time. The Bionic Man found that the only remaining engineer has been lying in the sleep capsule to continue life. So the people woke up, the engineer looking at each other's huge bodies, the first contact between human beings and the creator began. But although the old man who spent a lot of money to come to this planet, couldn't wait to ask the engineer too many questions, such as why to create Human beings and what caused the extinction of their planet. The result? Unexpectedly, the old man let the bionic man ask the engineer another question. That that is how to obtain eternal life. After all, human beings are created by the creator, and eternal life can certainly be solved for the creator. But the engineer did not answer any questions, but only slowly lifted the body of the bionic man. This operation of the engineer makes everyone panic. Elizabeth quickly escaped. At this moment, she also knows that this abandoned planet is not the engineer's home planet at all, but their military experimental base. The purpose is to take a large number of chemical and biological weapons to the earth, and then to wipe out all the life created there. For some reason, the ship crashed on this planet and the engineer fell asleep. However, now the engineer is awakened by humans, so he decides to continue to complete his mission. At this time, Elizabeth, in order to stop the engineer's plan, she told the other side's behavior to the captain. If they do not stop the engineer now, then the earth is very likely to be destroyed by the other side. After listening to Elizabeth's words, the captain did not know why the engineer wanted to do so, but for the sake of the fate of all mankind, he had to give up his life with two members of his team. And then accelerated the spaceship towards the direction Of the engineer. The engineer's spaceship was severely impacted by the Prometheus and finally lost the energy system, slowly fell towards the ground.

Luego fui atado a un armazón de hierro y otra dosis fue inyectada profundamente en mi médula ósea. El dolor irrumpió de inmediato en mi columna, pero apreté los dientes y soporté el dolor porque sabía que ese era el precio de volverme más fuerte. La transformación fue un éxito. Superé los límites de un ser humano normal, pero cuando fui a desafiar a Hulk uno contra uno. Como era de esperarse, Hulk me pateó de una sola patada y salí volando. Sufrí múltiples fracturas con minutas por todo mi cuerpo. Gracias al suero del supersoldado, me recuperé rápidamente. Para vengarme de Hulk, volví a inyectarme una dosis aún más alta, pero la sobrecarga desencadenó una mutación. Incluso crecieron espinas óseas en mi espalda. Encontré de inmediato a banner con la esperanza de provocar a Hulk y terminar todo de una vez. Pero sin importar cuánto lo provocara, Hulk se negó a salir como si ni siquiera me viera como un oponente digno. La humillación y la rabia inundaron mi mente, llevándome completamente a la locura. Después de que banner fue capturado, apunté con un arma al doctor Blue y lo obligué a inyectar en mi cuerpo la muestra de sangre de Hulk. Sin ninguna duda. El doctor Blue activó el dispositivo gamma, replicando por completo la mutación de banner. Un destello verde iluminó mi frente. Mi cuerpo comenzó a retorcerse y deformarse rápidamente. La combinación del supersuero y la radiación gamma finalmente completé la mutación. Me convertí en un monstruo. Impulsado por la ira abominación, empujé al doctor Blue a un lado, me lancé a las calles abarrotadas, liberando mi furia sin ninguna restricción. La gente huyó aterrorizada. Los soldados me dispararon cohetes, pero mi defensa era abrumadoramente fuerte. Las explosiones no podían herirme en absoluto. Las tropas retrocedieron aterradas en vehículos blindados y aún con todo el poder de fuego, no pudieron escapar de su destino. Los aplasté como si fueran latas de metal. Al ver las imágenes borrosas de vigilancia, banner comprendió la verdad, solo Hulk podía detenerme, pero yo acababa de tomar el antídoto que significaba que Hulk solo aparecería bajo un estrés extremo. Así que, después de despedirse de su novia, banner saltó del avión sin dudarlo. El impacto formó un enorme cráter. Hulk volvió a levantarse de entre los escombros. Mi batalla final había comenzado

Cualquiera que las pisara las activaría. Volví a desmontar más balas, saqué la pólvora, fabriqué un potente artefacto explosivo para detonar en el momento clave. Cabe una zanja profunda. La llené de gasolina y hice una mecha. Preparé un detonador y oculté todas las trampas bajo la hierba a lo largo de la ruta prevista del enemigo. La parte más importante de mi plan fue el túnel subterráneo. Recorté la escopeta de doble cañón y la soldé en la entrada del túnel. Afiné varillas de metal hasta hacerlas letales y las escondí en pozos profundos a ambos lados del túnel. Coloqué tablas pesadas en el techo del túnel con clavos de acero incrustados alrededor de los pequeños hoyos excavados desde los cuales podía atacar. Recordaba la ubicación de cada trampa, porque había tantas trampas que incluso temía destruir una por accidente. Si alguien lograba pasar por esas trampas, también tenía arcos y flechas. Las cuerdas tensadas al máximo para asegurar que nadie pudiera escapar del túnel. Finalmente, escondí más minas y explosivos en el túnel como última línea de defensa. Pero esta vez no luchaba por sobrevivir, sino por venganza. Estaba dispuesto a convertir todo en un cementerio para que aquellos que dañaron a mi familia pagaran el precio. Esa es la razón de mi furia. Esa es mi hija. Después de jubilarme, no volví a casarme. A los 50 años adopté a una niña llamada lisa. Cuando creció, decidió Ir a méxico a buscar a su padre biológico. Le supliqué que no lo hiciera, pero no me escuchó. Con la ayuda de un amigo, lisa lo encontró como yo había predicho. A él no le importaba en absoluto. En su día, él había golpeado hasta la muerte a la madre de lisa. Él consideraba a lisa una carga. Lisa se derrumbó. Pidió a su amigo que la llevara a un bar para relajarse, pero le pusieron droga en la bebida. Cuando despertó, estaba cautiva en un refugio de traficantes de personas. Allí comenzó el tormento más horrible. Ya no podía esperar más ansiedad en mi interior se convirtió en ira. Tomé mis armas, me fui en coche hacia méxico, preparado para buscar a esos malditos

Hasta que un día la madre murió otra vez. Al tocarlo, el niño la tocó de nuevo, pero esta vez nunca despertó. El niño entendió al fin. Cada persona solo podía revivir una vez y no quería ver más vidas perdidas. Un día vio a un perro muerto. Cuando lo tocó con su dedo, el perro volvió a la vida al instante. Años después, el niño ya era un hombre. De repente, un fugitivo cayó de un edificio. Debió haber muerto, pero al tocarlo revivió. El hombre lo volvió a tocar. Enseguida un policía presenció todo. Invitó al hombre a unirse a él. El hombre también quería usar su poder para hacer el bien. Así fueron a la morgue. Ese cadáver había sido asesinado por su propio perro. Para descubrir la verdad, el hombre puso un temporizador de un minuto y tocó al muerto. Resultó que el verdadero asesino era su secretario. Cuando el tiempo terminó, el hombre lo tocó otra vez. De esa manera resolvió el caso. El verdadero culpable fue arrestado. Pronto recibieron un segundo caso. La víctima era la chica que él había amado. Él la tocó suavemente. La chica pensó que él era el asesino. El hombre se apresuró a explicarle. Entonces ella le creyó. Pero en el momento del asesinato, la mujer no había visto el rostro del culpable para ayudarla a vengarse El hombre decidió no devolverla a la muerte

Which guy? The convict in the middle. He just whispered, help me. Fine. Okay. Let's handle the overflow. We've already pled not guilty, your honor. We're ready to go to trial. Good, Mr. Asa? Almost. Your honor. We're still trying to locate a witness. We ask for a continuance. How long do you need? Two months to do it. Good. Continuance granted. We'll go to trial April 15th. You were in Boncourt eight months ago? Yes. You were my second client. You've been in prison all this time? Yes, but it was just a disorderly charge. I know. With 150,000 dollar Bill. I couldn't afford it. But that was to punish me, not you. Didn't your case get called 3 times? The prosecutor keeps needing to find a witness. Didn't Bernie ask for a speedy trial any of those 3 times? No. He's new. He wasn't my lawyer. You've had three different lawyers? Four with you. What the hell is going on here? What's your name? Clayton Riggs. I'm Alicia. Florence. Yeah, and I'm Bernie. Let's go, Alicia. Visiting hours are over. You want my help, Alicia? Stop talking to my client. Sir, if you want my help, you can switch lawyers. Alicia, I need you to get the hell out. He's been in jail for 8 months. He lost his job, his wife, his son is with child services. And you wanna do what for him? Get him out. Takowski is never gonna change. The Trial date. You know that he will if we sue him. Do I just have immunity? Not if they knowingly violate a defendant's civil rights. Is this about getting back at Jakowski? No. And is this to assuage your guilty conscience? This is about getting a man who has been unlawfully imprisoned for eight months out of jail so he can be with his kid. And you're doing this pro Bono? It's simple. We'll take 20% of the 1.3 million. No, because there'll never be 1.3 million. Are you out of your tiny little mind? Mrs. Forrick? You don't need to say little when you say tiny. One or the other will do. You're silly. Me? You're suing a sitting judge. Do you understand the meaning of professional suicide? I know the meaning of a judge who let an innocent man sit in prison for eight months. Did you miss the day in law school where they taught the concept of judicial immunity? That protects you from being sued for what you did professionally, not personally. This crusade is gonna cost you. It's gonna cost you so much. Should we get that down on tape, your honor? Your ex parte threats? I didn't think so. See you in court. But we are filing a civil rights claim under 42 USC 1983. Going after the judge personally is merely an end around. No, we are holding Don Schakowski accountable as an individual for violating Mr. Riggs Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. And Eighth Amendment freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. He exceeded his authority, so he has to answer to this personally. My honor, this is a direct attack on the foundation of an independent judiciary. Imagine that your decision here in this case could be subject to a suit. It would be chaos. Exactly. Florick may like or dislike the way his honor Schakowski does his job, but she does not have the right to veto. We're not asking for a veto, your honor. This man has been held in prison for eight months, his bail set at $150,000. $150,000? What did he do? The charges? Disorderly conduct. $150,000 for disorderly conduct? Yes, your honor. Three men knocked him down coming out of a concert and stole his wallet. When the police arrived, they arrested him, too. He was the victim, not the perpetrator. That isn't proven yet. Yes, because Schakowski, his honor. Schakowski. His honor, Schakowski has delayed trial three times. Three times, your honor. And eight months later, our client is still in prison. He lost his job, his wife divorced him, and his eight year old child has been taken from his home. That is unjust. We ask that you rule on my client's immunity. Your honor, there is no suit here. If my client is found immune, I would agree. Thank you, your honor. No, I would agree that from all appearances, Mr. Riggs has had his civil rights violated. But the question is whether His honor, Shikowski did so knowingly. If he did, his immunity is stripped. After you pled not guilty, Clayton, what happened then? The judge slapped me with a six figure bail. And after arraignment, did you appear before Judge Schakowski again? Yeah, every couple months. They'd stick me in the van, bring me over. I'll be all ready for the trial. And then the prosecutor asked for more time, and the judge gave it. He never even blinked. Even though the prosecutor was delaying to find the same witness? Yes. Isn't it true, Mr. Riggs, that this wasn't your first criminal offense? Objection, Mr. Riggs. Past is irrelevant to Shakowski's immunity. Close to the issue of why Judge Shakowski set bail so high overall, in fact. Didn't the judge in that weapons case have to issue a bench warrant because you missed a court appearance? That was a few years ago. I was young and dumb. I turned myself in, and I didn't screw up again. Didn't you agree to each of the three continuances in your case? No, I never agreed. Really? Because I have transcripts of all three hearings, and every one of them clearly notes continuance by agreement.

Excuse me, Miss Little Girl, we have your passport. it's just a matter of time before we figure out who your parents are and how to contact them. Or you could just give us their names and numbers. Keep dreaming, copper. There you are. I see you. Charlie, do you have any idea what you've put me through? Excuse me? You're her mother? No, I'm the nanny.

Divorce is for people who are married to each other. I think maybe the thing you want to be is emancipated. That means that you are no longer dependent on your parents and They are no longer legally responsible for you. Okay, I'll go with that. Problem is in the state of New York, the legal age of emancipation is sixteen. How old are you? 16. You know the penalty for lying about something like this is 25 years hard labor, 15 knew it, but maybe they can make an exception. Little girl, I'm not a lawyer, so even if there was an exception to be made, I'm not the guy to get it for you. Now I have got a lot of work to do and I'm sure there is someplace you are supposed to be, so I'm gonna give you to that very nice lady who was standing by the door with me and she's gonna see about getting you home. It was nice to have met you and you and do you have a name? Charlotte Kingsington, but you can call me Charlie. Hmm. Okay, Charlie, when you turn 16, if this is something you still want, come and see me. Marissa, you yelled for me. Sir, I am entrusting you to get Charlie here home safe and sound. I'll do my best. Oh, it's almost 9. What do you say we close up and go home? I would if I could. I am still trying to reach somebody to come get our little girl. What do you mean? Where is she?

I felt different. Did you tell anybody? I didn't remember it, so I didn't say anything. Okay, Melanie. Um, if you were, if you were unable to consent and that could be rape. They said that it wasn't.

Well, Melanie doesn't feel like she was. Believe me, if there was any indication that something had happened against your will, we wouldn't have gone with it. So you're saying it was consensual. Well, Melanie has been trying to connect with Brian for weeks. Are you saying that Melanie cried rape because she didn't want Ryan to go with G? Jeffrey, we have to show them.

They have targeted this plump duck, but not to drag it back as a feast. Instead, they're going to throw it off a cliff 5 km away. These ants work together in perfect coordination to move the duck away, even crossing mountains and valleys to get rid of it. It turns out that this duck, which was camping on the mountain, had offended a worker ant. It saw the little ant dragging a giant bean and became very curious. The duck used its finger to poke the lone ant to test it, but it underestimated the little creature's strength. So the duck started playing pranks. It threw a thermos flask on top of the ant. The ant persisted. Then it piled fruits and vegetables on top of it. The ant wobbled, but still wasn't crushed. Push the ant to its limits. This jerk set up obstacles, but the resilient little creature got through them. The duck wouldn't give up. Its crazy ideas kept coming. It even made the ant walk a tightrope. The ant was now swaying terribly, even with its skills, couldn't handle the duck's tricks and was crushed on the spot. This despicable behavior made the ant furious. The duck showed no sympathy and even laughed. Seeing how enormous the duck was, the ant could only leave helplessly, but it was reluctant to give up so much food, so it excitedly ran back to the nest, not wanting to miss out on this. Treat, but the colony hadn't eaten cake in a long time. They thought the ant was lying. It wasn't until the ant went crazy and started swaying that it caught the captain's attention. They hadn't eaten fresh food in ages. Hearing about something delicious, the leader was motivated and sounded the alarm. Then the ant army poured out like it was in full combat mode. The oblivious duck was still snoring. The scout team arrived at the scene and climbed up the basket to start working, but the duck rolled over and blocked them. No big deal. Strength and numbers aren't just talk. Through teamwork, they can accomplish anything wild. So they dragged the duck over hills and other obstacles trying to get rid of it. The simple goal was to shake it off and steal its food. The duck finally woke up in a rage. It angrily charged up from the bottom of the cliff to the top. Seeing its food being stolen, it flew into a fury. But these ants moved so fast that the duck always failed. Their teamwork was perfect.

Not only was it difficult to pull, but it also couldn't maintain balance. The bear crashed severely on his first attempt to pull the car. Then he switched the positions of the wheels, but one side was still larger than the other. Eventually, he crashed again. This time, the car even fell apart. Looking at all the scattered debris, the bear suspected he was too stupid. Perhaps he should give up on making cars. But just after the bear left, several small animals happened to pass by this place. The scattered parts caught their attention. There was no possibility of repairing it. After such a crash, the wheels seemed like they could be repurposed. Several animals prepared to take away these wheels to avoid being thought of as stealing. The hedgehog specifically asked the magpie nearby if anyone wanted this small car. The magpie clearly said it had been abandoned. So they confidently pushed the wheels toward home. But when crossing a log bridge, the largest wheel accidentally fell into the water. The frog quickly jumped in to rescue it. Fortunately, the wood could float on the water surface. He pushed it all the way to the shore. With the help of several animals, they finally brought the wheels back home. Meanwhile, the magpie actually ran to the bear's home to tell on them, saying, someone had stolen your car. The bear was very Angry after hearing this.

From then on, they no longer had to climb trees to get home. With the bear's wheels, all the surrounding animals were very happy. Only the magpie came again to sow discord. Asking the bear how he did all the work, he said they were all bullying the bear. The kind hearted bear had already seen through the magpie's true nature and told him to leave immediately. As the bear made more and more wheels, even the little rabbit rode a bicycle. Although the bear wasn't skilled at making cars, making wheels was truly beneficial to the entire community.

These ants work together in perfect coordination to move the duck away, even crossing mountains and valleys to get rid of it. It turns out that this duck, which was camping on the mountain, had offended a worker ant. It saw the little ant dragging a giant bean and became very curious. The duck used its finger to poke the lone ant to test it, but it underestimated the little creature's strength. So the duck started playing pranks. It threw a thermos flask on top of the ant. The ant persisted. Then it piled fruits and vegetables on top of it. The ant wobbled, but still wasn't crushed. Push the ant to its limits. This jerk set up obstacles, but the resilient little creature got through them. The duck wouldn't give up. Its crazy ideas kept coming. It even made the ant walk a tightrope. The ant was now swaying terribly, even with its skills, couldn't handle the duck's tricks and was crushed on the spot. This despicable behavior made the ant furious. The duck showed no sympathy and even laughed. Seeing how enormous the duck was, the ant could only leave helplessly, but it was reluctant to give up so much food, so it excitedly ran back to the nest, not wanting to miss out on this. Treat, but the colony hadn't eaten cake in a long time. They thought the ant was lying. It wasn't until the ant went crazy and started swaying that it caught the captain's attention. They hadn't eaten fresh food in ages. Hearing about something delicious, the leader was motivated and sounded the alarm. Then the ant army poured out like it was in full combat mode. The oblivious duck was still snoring. The scout team arrived at the scene and climbed up the basket to start working, but the duck rolled over and blocked them. No big deal. Strength and numbers aren't just talk. Through teamwork, they can accomplish anything wild. So they dragged the duck over hills and other obstacles trying to get rid of it. The simple goal was to shake it off and steal its food. The duck finally woke up in a rage. It angrily charged up from the bottom of the cliff to the top. Seeing its food being stolen, it flew into a fury. But these ants moved so fast that the duck always failed. Their teamwork was perfect.

Inmediatamente después, los rotores cambiaron de forma con fluidez, extendiendo poco a poco su estructura desde un estado compacto hasta formar una figura estable en forma de cruz que se elevó rápidamente en el aire. Su objetivo era precisamente el portaaviones estadounidense a 5km de distancia. Pronto, el sistema de alerta temprana del portaaviones detectó la presencia del dron.

La cáscara del huevo de la criatura explosiva era extremadamente dura. Ya había usado una sierra eléctrica, gastando mucho tiempo antes de lograr hacer una abertura. Pero por dentro era suave, y vio dentro el alienígena. Como si detectara peligro. La larva comenzó a moverse, emitiendo una onda infrasónica, pidiendo ayuda a sus semejantes. El investigador tomó un bisturí. El alienígena sintió el peligro acercarse, y estos no eran humanos, eran humanos biológicos mejorados con tecnología mecánica, y una larva abrasadora de rostro salió para calmarla. Usaron una pistola eléctrica. Lo demás fue sencillo, el organismo de la criatura era blando, fácil de cortar, había que tener cuidado, su sangre era altamente ácida. El propósito de la autopsia era buscar los huevos del alienígena. Parecía un insecto, pero también como un pez. El investigador lo transfirió. Aquí. Había medio lóbulo pulmonar y bajo la nutrición de la carne. En menos de un día creció hasta convertirse en una criatura alienígena. Como una serpiente ya con apariencia de alienígena, pensaron en criarlo como una mascota. Este tamaño era adecuado. Como un híbrido. Ya había simulado ondas sonoras, aprendiendo el lenguaje de la criatura. Tras un de intercambio, se formó un vínculo más allá de las especies. En pocas horas, el alienígena había desarrollado manos y pies, y su agresividad aumentó, pero no había que preocuparse. Se usaba vidrio reforzado especial. Aquí, mientras no hubiera accidentes, el alienígena nunca escaparía. Wendy, quien estaba a Cargo de su cuidado. Ya había aprendido lo básico del idioma alienígena. Podía comunicarse de forma simple. Aunque el alienígena tenía una agresividad extrema, no sería extraño si de vez en cuando mostraba algo de mal temperamento, pero creían que con suficiente paciencia, eventualmente podría ser domesticado. Sin embargo, lo que complicaba las cosas era la velocidad de crecimiento de los alienígenas. En pocas horas ya alcanzaba el tamaño de un adulto. Pero en el laboratorio no solo había esta especie alienígena. Para probar el método de caza de la criatura con ojos, el investigador la encerró junto con una oveja en un espacio cerrado. Aunque parecía pequeña, probablemente no tenía cerebro como tal. Su inteligencia era notablemente alta. Primero evaluaba el nivel de peligro del objetivo y luego atacaba decisivamente en el momento adecuado en los gritos desgarradores de la oveja. En solo unos segundos, la criatura con ojos ya había reemplazado el ojo de la oveja. Desde el exterior, parecía casi idéntico al original, pero el ojo actuaba como el nuevo cerebro, haciendo que se levantara nuevamente claro. Al principio, habría un proceso de adaptación, pero en poco tiempo aprendió que la oveja debía mantenerse en pie sobre 4 patas. El investigador había instalado previamente detectores en la oveja y observando las ondas, ya era difícil determinar qué tipo de criatura era exactamente. Sin embargo, los alienígenas también son seres biológicos y necesitan comer, beber y hacer sus necesidades, normalmente otra sintética

She was standing in front of her mother, who could not see her. The mother was calling the police because she was missing. Ella panicked. Fuck's sake, I'm right here. Yes, I'm home. Her mother still couldn't see her and the vase she had just dropped on the floor had somehow disappeared. She looked back to see the vase still intact in the same place. Ella ran upstairs to call her sister. The result was the same. And then she looked in the mirror and saw the strangulation marks on her neck. She returned to her room and found that in addition to her neck and legs were covered with bruises. Ella has no idea what happened to her except that she and her boyfriend participated in a motorcycle race the day before, but she doesn't remember anything. After the race, Ella decided to go to the game to investigate. When she came to the game, her parents, family and teammates were looking for her in the woods. And she knew in her heart that they could not find her here because this morning she woke up at the bottom of the lake and then went home. Now she must still be in the lake, but she could not let her family know. Just then, her teddy ran to her and began to bark at her. Ella found that Teddy can see her. She suddenly had an idea, so she Took Teddy to the lake. The stepfather found the unusual behavior of the dog. Guess it must be smelling something. Then called everyone to follow up. Soon, she asked Teddy to take them to the lake when a flock of crows flew up and began to circle the lake. The boyfriend looked out at the lake and suddenly saw a black object in the water.

The construction worker accidentally got electrocuted. She actually grabbed a large wooden beam and started pounding on the worker with it. The good news is the wire was released. The bad news is he broke three ribs and fractured his right wrist. What's strange is that when the firefighters arrived, they couldn't help but laugh like pigs because they realized the man hadn't been electrocuted at all. It was the team doctor who first noticed something was wrong. The man's heart rate was stable around 70. She couldn't help but wonder, maybe. I'm not an electrician. Not read me a good book yet? No. What was even more puzzling was his hand that had been holding the wire wasn't burned. The woman said it was impossible. He was holding that very wire. The firefighters started checking the wire, and guess what they found? The wire wasn't even live. The woman was completely stunned. It wasn't until the team doctor saw the medical alert tag that they realized the man had epilepsy. Turns out he hadn't been electrocuted. He had just had a seizure. He was having a seizure there? Seems that way. Oh, my god! I beat. I beat an epileptic with a 2 by 4. The woman felt so guilty and kept apologizing to the worker. The firefighters couldn't help but tease her. That sure is a unique way to win a man's heart.

You might be wondering what was so funny. Well, the answer is obviously something funny. It just happened. The emergency center received a call. A car wash employee had an accident. The firefighters rushed over immediately. The owner was leading the way while complaining. He always tells his employees to turn off the power before cleaning, but the employees always ignore him. So what happened? The employee got stuck on the car wash brush. The paramedics quickly checked him out. They found that he wasn't seriously injured, so they rescued him and sent him to the ambulance. As everyone was getting ready to wrap up, a hearty laugh suddenly filled the air. Little by, and the captain went to the control room. It turns out that buck was watching the surveillance footage, watching how the guy got stuck. Following the principle that it's more fun to laugh together, he asked the owner to rewind and play it again. The unlucky employee was repeatedly humiliated and got stuck on the car wash brush again. The captain sternly warned buck. The victim almost got seriously injured. And guess what happened next? What? I'm pregnant. Ha ha ha!

But this time, there was a note stuck to the box. Drink me quickly. With police officers watching her every move, Kelly immediately recognized the familiar handwriting on the note. It belonged to her father, who was now wanted by the authorities. So while the officer monitoring her happened to look down, she gulped the entire yogurt in one breath. No one could have predicted what happened next. After Kelly drove away, the surveillance officer reported the incident to his superiors. Things grew even stranger when the arriving inspector found the yogurt box Kelly had thrown into the trash. Without hesitation, he stuck out his middle finger and used it to scoop out the remaining yogurt, tasting it directly. That seemingly insignificant action would cost the inspector dearly. Meanwhile, shortly after drinking the yogurt, Kelly felt a sudden wave of nausea. Clutching her stomach, she rushed into the women's restroom. And that's when he appeared. It was Kelly's father. But he didn't embrace his long lost daughter. Instead, he immediately located the listening device the police had secretly planted on her and blocked its signal with a jammer to make you nauseous. Nissan, it turned out, had been a CIA operative. Someone capable of predicting a person's prediction. As long as Kelly took the antidote he brought, she'd be completely fine. But without It the consequences would be far beyond anything she could imagine. During their brief reunion, Kelly revealed a shocking truth. After her beloved mother was murdered, her stepfather Jess had suddenly surrounded himself with bodyguards. And the police, framing Neeson as the killer, might have been part of Jess's scheme. Neeson made a dangerous decision to follow Jess's convoy and forced them to reveal the truth behind his ex wife's death. But as he drove along a winding Mountain Road, a large SUV suddenly charged toward him from behind. Though Nissan dodged the first hit, the killer rammed him again, clearly intent on eliminating him. With the car inching closer to the cliff's edge, it seemed there was no way out. The vehicle was reduced to scraps, but the cautious assassin still tossed in a high powered grenade for good measure. Only once the car was engulfed in flames did the attackers drive away confidently. But to everyone's astonishment, Nissan emerged from the slope below alive.

At that time, they could not stand each other. One wrong word and they almost started swinging. But in the quarter finals, they both delivered impressive performances and advanced smoothly into the final four. Joining them in the semifinals are the Brazilian gymnast and the bearded Colombian. The most outrageous performance still belongs to that bearded guy. Facing the non stop attacks from the North Korean fighter, he stood there without dodging or flinching, took several punches and even interacted with the crowd below. Only after he had his fun did he start fighting back. And of course, the bearded man easily won and entered the semifinals. The four eliminated fighters were supposed to be sent back to their prisons, but instead the guards brought them to a brick Kiln, dump them there casually. Meanwhile, Boyka and the others were still being forced into the quarry for hard labor. And Caden, the non stop talker, even patted Boyka's injured knee. Boyka at this point was already furious, but Caden kept running his mouth beside him, so Boyka punched him straight in. The face. The two immediately started grappling. The guards rushed over and pulled them apart. Then they locked them inside a narrow, dark mineshaft where they were kept for a full day, enduring torture no normal person could stand.

But Leon didn't expect that the other party would directly pull out a pistol. Seeing the seriously injured boy lying on the ground, David was very regretful. It turned out that Leon was once a very friendly child. He often participated in some public welfare activities to help the poor in the community. But some street hooligans regarded him as an oddity. Because this street was filled with a large number of criminals, they thought that everyone should deal drugs. Leon's behaviour made them look like clowns.

He decided to protect Leon and teach the boy some fighting skills for self defense. After three months of training, Leon gradually became mature and steady.

The boy's mother fell into a complete breakdown upon seeing her son's body. David also fell into deep self blame because of this incident. The gangs in this neighborhood had just reached a peace agreement. Tommy didn't want to break the peace, but it was too late. To avenge Leon. He ordered his men to find the murderer. As long as they killed John, they could get $20,000. Hey, yo. Hey, bro. Hey, gang, check it out. You mad though, right? Who asked, man, this is

As a hidden master living off the grid, my mission was to protect these waters. With a small flick of my fingers, the mechanism slowly activated. Countless gears began to turn. One after another, the formation hidden beneath the river burst into life. Massive stone pillars rose from the water. Threads shot out in every direction, weaving a deadly net. In the blink of an eye. Five masked intruders couldn't dodge in time. At that moment, Mike is the nephew of the 48 villages chief was sparring with his fellow disciples. He vaguely overheard them whispering that his skills were no match for Annie's. Just then, Annie walked by carrying a wine jar. Mike's pride couldn't take it and he challenged her right away. Annie wanted to avoid the fight, but the wine jar slipped and shattered and the two of them started trading blows instantly. Meanwhile, the river rippled again. He tossed a handful of fallen leaves, revealing the invisible threads in the air. Then he leapt onto the web using incredible lightness skills, walking on those razor sharp lines as if they were flat ground. Before I could react, he had nearly reached the opposite shore. I threw my fishing rod at him, only for it to become his final stepping point. After breaking through the thousand mechanism array, the young man turned back and nodded. At me, I watched his figure disappear in the distance, a deep unease rising in my chest. In hundreds of years, no one had ever crossed the youngster alive. I immediately fired a signal flare, warning the 48 villages receiving the alert. The chief sent everyone to search for the intruder. While patrolling, Annie saw birds scattering from the forest. Realizing the trespasser had reached the restricted grounds, she and Mike rushed after him. At a fork in the road, she plucked a leaf and tossed it forward. The leaf snapped clean in midair, revealing the invisible danger lying ahead.

He threw a cup of boiling liquid straight at Tyson's face and said it was a special greeting from Boyka. Tyson exploded with rage and grabbed the man's wrist. If the guards had not rushed over, that guy would have hit the ground right there. Back in the cell, Tyson quickly washed the stuff off his face. Then he went to the cafeteria with his cellmate. Suddenly, everyone around them stood up. Tyson turned around and saw Boyka walking in with his little crew. His cellmate panicked and told Tyson to stand up, but Tyson had zero intention of moving. Seeing this boy, Kazuki walked over trying to threaten him. You stand up. Tyson picked up his cup of water and walked straight toward boyka. Boyka, huh? Now what kind of bitch ass name is that? The inmates around them froze in disbelief. Everyone knew that even the warden had to step aside when Boyka showed up. Even Boyka could not believe someone dared challenge him in public. Fuming with anger, he charged at Tyson. The two immediately got into a fight. Luckily, the guards pulled them apart in time. Everyone thought the conflict would end there. The next day, Tyson found his cellmate being beaten up by Boyka's men. He rushed in. And pulled him out of danger. His action instantly enraged the group. Without saying a word, they all charged at him, but none of them were a match for Tyson. He knocked them all down in just a few moves. Seeing his men get destroyed like that, Boyka was furious. And so the king of underground fighting, Boyka and the World Heavyweight Champion, Tyson, were officially headed for the ultimate showdown.

I did my time in the cold bus. They said I could go home. Well, you were misinformed and we'll be taking you back to your old stomping grounds, New York City. For what? Rape and murder. It's taken 25 years, but your past has finally caught up to you. After 25 years on the run, serial killer Brian was finally captured in Miami. Benson arrived to take custody, where she met FBI Agent Dana, who eagerly suggested teaming up to investigate the cold case. During the interrogation, Brian readily admitted to killing the first four victims. However, when asked about the fifth victim, Kira, he denied ever having seen her. She's not even my type. Red hair. I didn't do her. Dana believed Brian was merely making a desperate attempt to cover up the truth as Kira's manner of death mirrored that of the first four victims. However, while Brian's DNA was found in the first four victims bodies, neither DNA nor fingerprints were recovered from Kira's remains. The detectives head to the evidence locker to recheck the case, but the box is empty. The log shows that 10 years ago, a detective took the evidence. With no evidence, Brian stubbornly denied killing Kira and the case reached an impasse. Dana speculated that Brian refused to admit to the crime because Kira had been over two months pregnant when she died. But wait, how did Dana know that? The autopsy didn't Mention it. Dana bursts into the interrogation room and demands to question Brian alone. Using a smooth, almost serpentine voice, she managed to get Brian to confess to the fifth rape murder. Do you remember? I remember. Just as Dana triumphantly declared the case closed, something unexpected occurred.

Pero esta escasa comida no pudo saciar su apetito, así que agarró al señor cangrejo y lo arrojó a la parrilla. Al presenciar el comportamiento loco de Patrick, Bob Esponja y Calamardo cayeron en la locura. Arrojaron todo lo que pudieron encontrar al fuego para una barbacoa salvaje. Este era fondo de bikini hace miles de millones de años. Cuando la luz del sol brillaba sobre los monstruos marinos, inmediatamente emitieron poderosas ondas de sonido. Una roca cayó y golpeó a Bob Esponja. Al instante, Bob Esponja volvió a colocar el despertador. En su lugar, se puso una falda de hierba hecha a mano. Su primera tarea fue sacar a pasear a Gary prehistórico, pero dejó rastros de baba asquerosos. Calamardo se despertó y quiso enfrentarse a Gary, pero terminó aplastado. Luego, Calamardo pisó accidentalmente. La baba resbaló todo el camino y chocó contra la casa de piedra, despertando a Patricio. Después, Bob Esponja y Patricio jugaron juegos. De repente, nubes oscuras se agruparon en el cielo y una fuerte lluvia cayó. Un rayo golpeó el bosque y encendió llamas. Esta fue la primera vez que vieron fuego. Calamardo metió su tentáculo en el fuego y casi se asó en deliciosos tentáculos de calamar. Bob, Esponja y Patricio vieron esto y también metieron sus manos en el fuego. Patricio olió su mano, luego espolvoreó un poco de condimento y Comenzó a devorarla. Bob Esponja y Calamardo sintieron hambre al instante. Sin embargo, Bob Esponja recogió dos anémonas de mar, pero fue engañado por Calamardo y los dejó caer al fuego. Bob Esponja usó un palo de madera para ensartar las anémonas cocidas, las olió y se las metió en la boca. El increíble sabor dejó a Bob Esponja extasiado. Rápidamente lo compartió con Calamardo. El emocionado Calamardo elogió a Bob Esponja como el Einstein del océano. Desde ese momento, descubrieron este nuevo método de cocción y tiraron todo lo que encontraron a la parrilla. Pronto, todo lo cercano fue devorado. Comieron hasta saciarse y se prepararon para ir a casa. Pero de repente pensó en las preciosas llamas, así que comenzaron a pelear por ellas. En ese momento, la lluvia intensa comenzó a caer del cielo. De nuevo, las llamas se apagaron. El enfadado Squid War pensó que habían arruinado el fuego al instante

Todo lo que tiene que hacer es firmar un contrato con una diosa, luego oler su ropa y bum se transforma en un dios de la guerra. El truco para volver a la normalidad es que tiene que aceptar una recompensa especial de la diosa. Jack pensó que esta habilidad le permitiría acercarse a todas las diosas en la base, pero en cambio sus misiones diarias resultaron ser cocinar y lavar la ropa de todo el equipo. Claro, pasar tiempo con las diosas era agradable y todo, pero jack realmente solo quería salir a luchar contra monstruos con ellas, así al menos tendría una excusa válida para estar cerca. Y justo entonces, reina miró a jack con evidente curiosidad. Claramente quería ver qué hacía. Jack tan poderoso tiene una forma peculiar de funcionar, porque mientras jack limpiaba, se encontró con una de las chicas duchándose. Justo cuando estaba disfrutando de la vista, fue sorprendido infraganti por la pequeña reina, quien tomó una foto del crimen. Usando la foto, reina chantajeó a jack para que fuera su sirviente personal. No es que a jack realmente le importara a quién servía, pero las exigencias de reina estaban completamente fuera de lugar. Jack estaba a punto de quejarse con la diosa cuando el resto del equipo anunció que todos irían a la sede para una reunión, dejando solo a jack y reina para vigilar la base. Jack se preparó pensando que reina Lo atormentaría sin parar, pero en su lugar lo arrastró. Para jugar un juego de pelea. El perdedor tiene que quitarse una prenda de ropa. Jack, siendo un profesional en los videojuegos, no estaba ni un poco preocupado. Lo que él no se dio cuenta fue que reina había estado luchando contra monstruos reales por tanto tiempo. Los videojuegos eran un juego de niños para ella. Unas pocas rondas después, y jack estaba reducido a solo sus calzoncillos y luego incluso esos se quitaron. Ese último movimiento destrozó la última defensa mental de jack. Pero antes de que pudiera recuperarse, un monstruo real irrumpió de repente en la base. Reina volvió instantáneamente a su tamaño completo y derribó al intruso, pero otro monstruo se escondía en las sombras y lanzó un ataque sorpresa mientras reina luchaba por mantenerse firme. Jack se lanzó a la lavandería, agarró la ropa de la diosa y la apretó contra su rostro, pero eso no fue suficiente. El aroma solo no era lo bastante fuerte para desencadenar la transformación. Entonces jack recordó las botas altas de la diosa que había usado durante días. Tenían que ser lo bastante potentes. Una sola inhalación y jack salió disparado de la habitación transformado. Con un solo golpe aplastó la cabeza del monstruo, pero la transformación no duró mucho. Él volvió a su forma original en el aire y reina tuvo que atraparlo. Como solo lamió la ropa. Esta vez, la diosa le dio un masaje como recompensa, ¿parece? Que si jack quiere desbloquear experiencias aún más gratificantes, podría tener que apuntar a áreas más sensibles

Not yet. Maybe there's nothing to find. Or maybe no one was trained to know where cops would look. Kelly built this place up from the studs, probably designed a hidey hole we'll never find. Did we do all this? Grace said the walls ripped apart before he came in. Why would Nolan do that? Don't know. Don't care? No. Think about it. Armstrong insists that Nolan tried to kill him. But then why did Nolan leave before the job was done? Why rush back here and tear the walls up? I'll tell you why. It's because he's looking for the evidence, too. Bradford, you see now that's a proper hiding hole for a civilian. You just got done saying Nolan would build something we'd never find. Maybe I overestimated the guy. No. Look, Nolan's a lot of things, but he's not sloppy. He comes in here desperate, rips open the walls, ends up in the bedroom, finds the opening behind the bed filled with whatever Armstrong hit in there. And then what? And then you don't think that's random garbage, do you? No, that's Nolan being smart. He knew he'd find the good, so he chucked him down the hill. Our warrant is for Nolan's property, not the neighbor's. So if we open that bag without a steepled warrant, anything we find in there will be inadmissible. Exactly. So let's go get that warrant. Go for it. But it's a waste of time. What? Look, that is Not the evidence. Nolan wouldn't jeopardize evidence by throwing it down a hill where it could be damaged or destroyed. If I'm right and he's innocent, then that means the real evidence is hidden somewhere in this house. That bag is just a fake out meant to buy him some time. Time for what?

Will have 72 hours to present their case against you. Yeah, I know. I know that, of course. But I also know that you're in shock, and I need you to focus. If convicted, you're looking at 25 years. Which is why you need to let me do all the talking. One mistake, one ill chosen word, and you're going to prison. We don't have to play it like that. The truth is on my side. And you think that means something? If you are any other defendant. What? Never mind. No, I want to know if I was any other defendant. What? You are a white man, a cop. You have already been treated with a level of deference my other clients would never get. If you were black or brown, the police would have created exigent circumstances and kicked the door in. Shot you if they thought you reacted aggressively. Arrested you if you surrendered, confident that the D A. Would bully you into a plea deal. That's not fair. I'm not that kind of cop. Neither is gray. You're telling me you've never bent the rules? Not like that. Look, you have a chance to survive this because of who you are, but only if you do exactly what I say. Can you handle that?

FBI, open up. The battering ram hit our front door. Before I could even process what was happening, six agents in tactical gear swarmed into my room, weapons drawn, shouting commands. One agent ripped my headset off. Another yanked me out of my gaming chair. My mom was screaming, down, there's hands behind your back. I put my hands up immediately watching my Fortnite character get eliminated on screen. Final two players. I've been so close. They cuffed me and sat me on my bed. Agent searched everything, my PC, my phone, my notebooks, my closet. Mom and dad were brought upstairs. Both of them look terrified. The lead agent was a woman with short gray hair. She pulled out a tablet and held it toward my parents. Your son has been making terrorist threats. We have recordings. My balls dropped to the floor. She pressed play. My voice came through the speaker clear as day. Gonna eliminate everyone in the building. Nobody's getting out. Mom, gasp. Dad's face went white. Wait, that's not. I started. The agent cut me off. She played another clip. My voice again. Got my explosives ready, taking out at least 20 people. We take these threats extremely seriously. The agent said. Your son's school will be shut down tomorrow. Bomb dogs are searching the building. I didn't threaten anyone. My voice was shaking. I was playing Fortnite. It's a video game. We know what Fortnite is, another agent said flatly, bagging my gaming PC. These recordings don't sound like a game. The lead agent played another clip. Running double pump and AR. Tomorrow gonna be ready. Mom started crying. Dad looked at me like I was a stranger. Kevin, if you're planning something, you need to tell us right now. I'm not planning anything. It's a game. Two more agents came upstairs holding printed discord messages. They showed my parents screenshots. Hitting pleasant at three PM tomorrow. Got my whole loadout ready for this. Taking the high ground and picking everyone off. Those are locations in the game. I shouted, strategies we use. The lead agent's face didn't change. We've contacted three of your online friends. They're being questioned right now. Miles, Terry, Zach, all three were in interrogation rooms because of me. A younger agent spoke from the doorway. His teachers say he's isolated, eats lunch alone, spends all his time gaming. The lead agent showed my parents a pamphlet titled Warning Signs of Teen Violence. She named School Shootings, Columbine, Parkland, Uvalde. Each word made mom cry harder. They found my notebook with Fortnite strategies, building patterns, weapon stats, landing spots, tactical planning, the agent said, photographing every page. Dad tried to defend me. Kevin's never been violent. He's never been in a fight. That's what every parent says right before it happens, the agent replied. They bagged my controller, my headset, everything. An agent Scrolled through my YouTube history, hours of combat footage in tutorials for Fortnite. I was sobbing now, chest tight. The agent's radio crackled. School sweep complete. No explosives, no weapons. Building is secure. The lead agent frowned. Could have stashed them elsewhere. She turned back to me. Where are they hidden? There's nothing to hide. My parents were whispering about lawyers. The agents pulled up more recordings. My voice saying, pushing, now throwing grenades. Full squad wipe. Nobody's surviving this.

My real name was Anakin Skywalker Smith, not a nickname, not my middle name. That was my actual legal first and middle name printed on my birth certificate. My parents met at a Star Wars convention in 1997, got engaged at another convention, had a Star Wars themed wedding. When I was born in 2002, they thought naming me after the main character would be the ultimate tribute to their favourite franchise. They love Star Wars so much they had a room in our house dedicated to collectibles, spent thousands on replica lightsabers and went to every movie premiere in full costume. When I was little, it didn't matter because kids didn't get the reference yet. Elementary school was manageable because most kids hadn't seen the movies. Teachers would smile awkwardly when they read my name, but nobody made it a big deal. Then fourth grade happened and the revenge of the Sith came out. Suddenly every kid in school knew exactly who Anakin Skywalker was and what he became. A kid named Marcus stood up in the cafeteria and yelled, there's Darth Vader, and the entire lunchroom lost it. Within days, kids started making breathing sounds when I walked by, doing forced show gestures, calling me the chosen one in this mocking tone. Someone put a Darth Vader mask in my locker. The jokes never stopped. Middle school destroyed me. Every single teacher who called roll would Pause at my name. Some would even laugh thinking it was funny. Like my parents did something clever. Kids who didn't know me would hear my name and immediately start quoting the movies. I ate lunch in the library because the cafeteria was constant harassment. Someone started a petition as a joke to get me to change my last name to Vader. It got 150 signatures before a teacher confiscated it. I begged my parents to let me go by my middle name, Skywalker, but my dad said that's even worse. And my mom insisted I should be proud of such a unique, powerful name. They genuinely thought they'd give, give me this amazing gift. By 8th grade, I stopped introducing myself entirely. I just say call me whatever you want. Because I knew the second I said my real name, people would either laugh or immediately start making Star Wars references. I started skipping classes where substitute teachers might call my name out loud because I couldn't handle the attention anymore. High school was when everything fell apart. First day of freshman year, the principal read me.

I tried talking to her about it, but every concern I raised, she'd text Josh and he'd send back some study or success story that made her feel like she was doing something amazing. He kept saying things like your husband just doesn't understand the science and he's probably jealous of your progress. The breaking point came last Tuesday. Nina fainted at work, just collapsed right at her desk. Co workers called me in a panic and I rushed to meet her at the hospital. The doctor said her blood sugar was dangerously low and asked about her eating habits. When Nina admitted she'd only been eating once a day for the past month, the doctor was horrified. He explained how dangerous that was, especially since she's not overweight to begin with. She was literally malnourishing herself. I thought that would be the wake up call. But when we got home, the first thing Nina did was text Josh about what happened. He immediately called her and spent an hour convincing her that the doctor didn't understand and that her body was just adjusting to the new lifestyle. That's when I lost it. Grab the phone and told Josh exactly what I thought of his amateur nutritionist bullshit. I said either help my wife get healthy or stay the hell away from us because watching her starve herself was killing me. Josh had the nerve to tell me I was being controlling and that Nina was an adult who could make her own decisions, he said. I was obviously threatened by her transformation and trying to sabotage.

Josh immediately jumped in with his unsolicited advice about intermittent fasting and keto and all this other stuff he'd been reading about online. At first, I thought it was sweet that he cared. Nina started doing this 16 to 8 fasting thing where she'd only eat between noon and eight PM she seemed happy about it, lost like five pounds pretty quickly. Josh would text her constantly asking about her progress, sending her articles, cheering her on. But then it got weird. Nina started skipping our usual Sunday brunches because she couldn't eat until noon. She sit there with black coffee while I ate pancakes alone looking miserable. When I suggested maybe taking a break from the fasting on weekends, she'd get defensive and say Josh explained how important consistency was. Then Josh convinced her to try this thing called omad, one meal a day. Nina was basically starving herself. For 23 hours and then eating one huge meal at dinner, she'd be shaky and irritable all day, then crash.

I tried talking to her about it, but every concern I raised, she'd text Josh and he'd send back some study or success story that made her feel like she was doing something amazing. He kept saying things like your husband just doesn't understand the science and he's probably jealous of your progress. The breaking point came last Tuesday. Nina fainted at work, just collapsed right at her desk. Her co workers called me in a panic and I rushed to meet her at the hospital. The doctor said her blood sugar was dangerously low and asked about her eating habits. When Nina admitted she'd only been eating once a day for the past month, the doctor was horrified. He explained how dangerous that was, especially since she's not overweight to begin with. She was literally malnourishing herself. I thought that would be the wake up call. But when we got home, the first thing Nina did was text Josh about what happened. He immediately called her and spent an hour convincing her that the doctor didn't understand that her body was just adjusting to the new lifestyle. That's when I lost it. I grabbed the phone and told Josh exactly what I thought of his amateur nutritionist bullshit. I said either help my wife get healthy or stay the hell away from us cause watching her starve herself was killing me. Josh had the nerve to tell Me, I was being controlling and that Nina was an adult who could make her own decisions. He said, I was obviously threatened by her transformation and trying to sabotage her progress. I hung up and Nina immediately started crying, saying I was making her choose between her.

I grabbed my bag and walked straight out the door. They all started screaming at me as I left. My my husband followed me outside and started arguing about how I insulted his family and disrespected his dad's memory by acting like that. I told him he needed to wake up and see how insane his family was being. He said they just needed time to process that it's a girl instead of the boy they expected. Then he told me I should just play along with them and eventually they'll get over it. I said absolutely not. I told him to take me home right then. He refused. So I pulled out my phone and called an Uber while he stood there staring at me. When the Uber pulled up, I got in and left him standing in the parking lot. He called me 15 times on the drive home.

He saw photos from our family vacation in July and told everyone I was the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen. Showed The photos. To his friends. Her fiance promised I'd be his brother's date. They shook on it. I'm sitting there in complete shock. My boyfriend's been part of this family.

Gramps bought me six books about World War 2 last week just because I mentioned I was interested. Even got me a documentary series on Blu ray. He owns a restaurant downtown and gave me a job there. I only work when I want to, but it gets me money, real money that I can save. Mom used to steal any cash I had for her habit. Now I've got $400 in a bank account Gramps helped me me open. He matches whatever I save. I got suspended last Wednesday for fighting. This kid kept running his mouth about my mom, kept making snorting sounds whenever I Walk.

Finally he asked what happened. I told him. He was quiet for another minute, then said, sounds like you were defending someone you love, and that's not something to be ashamed of, even if you went about it wrong. That weekend he installed a heavy bag in the garage and taught me how to throw a proper punch at three hours, showing me footwork. He does weird stuff that annoys me. Sometimes he hugs me without asking, comes into my room without knocking, snores like a chainsaw, vacuums at two in the morning when he can't sleep. Won't let me watch anything over PG thirteen unless he screams at first. But he also keeps orange juice in the fridge because I mentioned I like it once. Makes spaghetti every Thursday because it's my favourite. Bought me a giant box of Legos after he caught me playing with my uncle's old set. The expensive kind too, like $80. Two weeks ago I got the flu. Nothing serious, just felt like garbage. It was my night to do dishes, but Gramps wouldn't let me. Kept bringing me water every hour, asking if I needed anything.

I'm 16 and had nowhere else to go, so I moved in with my grandpa. The first night he made me spaghetti, just regular spaghetti with jarred sauce. But I started crying at the table because as I realized I hadn't eaten a real meal in two weeks, mom would forget to buy groceries, then scream at me for being ungrateful when I'd ask for food. She spent $300 a week on substances but couldn't afford a 10 dollar pack of chicken. Gramps didn't say anything about me crying. He just pushed the whole pot toward me and told me to eat as much as I wanted. I ate until I felt sick. Then he made me a plate for tomorrow's lunch. Before I moved in, I was sleeping on our couch because mom sold my mattress for substance money. She said I didn't need it anyway since I was barely home. I'd wake up with back pain every morning. Gramps gave me my uncle's old room, queen sized bed, clean sheets that smelled like laundry detergent. He said I could redecorate however I want.

My friend Hazel and I have been going out to eat together for almost two years. And somewhere along the way she decided that her being vegetarian means she gets to eat my food but I can never eat hers. It started small at first. She'd ask for a bite of my burger or steal a few of my fries. But over time it escalated to the point where she basically plans her entire order around splitting mine. The thing is, I love sharing food with people. I'm the person who orders three appetizers so everyone can try everything. But with Hazel, it's different because it's completely one sided. She'll order a seven dollar side salad, then eat half of my 18 our entree and act like she's doing me a favor by keeping me company while I eat. I've tried bringing it up casually like, hey, wanna split an appetizer? And she always says, oh, no, I'm vegetarian, I can't eat most of those things. But the second my food arrives, her fork is already on my plate. Two months ago, we went to a diner and she ordered oatmeal and fruit for $6. I got a full breakfast platter with eggs, bake and pancakes for $14. She ate three of my pancakes, half my bacon and didn't even ask. Last month we went to an Italian place and I ordered chicken Parmesan. She Ordered minestrone soup and a small Caesar salad. The moment my plate hit the table, she said, oh, that looks amazing. Can I try some? I said, sure, thinking she meant one bite. She ate four full pieces of my chicken, taking all the cheese and sauce with it. When I suggested we split her soup, she laughed and said, oh, this is vegetarian. You wouldn't like it. There's no protein in here.

He went through my things while I was gone. What is this? He asked quietly. His voice was shaking. I looked at the paper in his hand. Eight months of weekend paychecks. Nearly $6,000. That's my money, I said. You've been hiding money from me. He stood up so fast, the chair fell over from us. We're married. This is our money. No, I said. This is money I earned working a job you forced me to take because I didn't deserve to be tired, remember? Because I wasn't working hard enough. His face changed, like he was finally hearing his own words thrown back at him. That's not what I meant. He started. It's exactly what you meant. You told me I wasn't pulling my weight, so I pulled it. And now I'm pulling myself out of this marriage. He started crying then. Actual tears running down his face, begging me not to leave, saying he would change, saying he didn't mean any of it, saying he loved me and couldn't live without me. I told him I already signed a lease, already talked to a lawyer, already packed. His crying got louder. He grabbed my arm and asked how I could do this to him. I looked at him, holding on to me like I was his property, and said, I'm tired, Kevin. And for the first time, I deserve to be. I moved out that weekend. His mother Called me heartless. His sister said I gave up too easily. His friends said every marriage has problems and I should have tried harder. None of them knew what it was like to live with someone who made you feel small every single day. Who counted your hours and measured your exhaustion and decided you didn't deserve their basic human feelings. Kevin text me constantly now. Long messages about how sorry he is, how he took me for granted, how he'll do anything to make it right. He said he'll quit his job, find something easier if that's what I want. He said he'll work two jobs himself if that's what it takes. I read them and feel nothing. He had years to treat me like an equal. Instead, he treated me like an employee who wasn't meeting quota. Now I have my own place. Fun job, weekends off. I sleep until noon on Saturdays, and I don't feel guilty about being tired. Kevin is still crying. His mom says he barely eats. His sister says he sits in our old house staring at my empty closet. I wish I could feel bad for him, but you can't order from an empty cup. And he spent years making sure mine was bone dry.

So he made me get a second one. Last week he found out what I did with that extra money, and now he won't stop crying. I married Kevin when I was 26. He was charming and confident, and everyone said we made a beautiful couple. What they didn't see was how he treated me behind closed doors. It wasn't hitting. Kevin never raised a hand. It was worse in some ways. It was constant criticism, constant control, constant reminders that I wasn't doing enough. I worked full time as a dental hygienist. Eight hours a day on my feet, cleaning teeth and dealing with anxious patients. I'd come home exhausted and Kevin would be sitting on the couch watching sports. He worked construction and made decent money, more than me. He never let me forget that, either. I mentioned once that I was tired after a long shift. Kevin looked at me like I said something offensive. Tired, he repeated. You sit in an air conditioned office all day poking at teeth. Try working in 90 degree heat hauling lumber. I didn't argue. I Learned early that arguing made everything worse. But it stop. Every time I said I was worn out or needed rest, he would remind me that his job was harder, that I didn't know real work, that I was lazy compared to him. Then one night he said we needed More money. We had bills piling up, he said. Even though I paid half of everything, he decided I should get a second job. Something on weekends to bring in extra cash. I asked if he was going to get one, too. He laughed. I already work 50 hours a week. You barely work 40. You don't deserve to be tired until you're putting in the same hours I do. Those words stuck in my chest like a knife. You don't deserve to be tired. Like exhaustion was something you had to earn. Like my feelings didn't count unless I met his standards. I got a second job. Weekends at a retail store, folding clothes and dealing with rude customers. Now I was working six days a week. Kevin seemed satisfied. He'd watch me drag myself through the door on Sunday nights, barely able to stand, and he'd nod like I was finally pulling my weight. But here's the thing. Kevin didn't know the second job paid cash under the table. And instead of putting that money toward our bills, I opened a separate bank account. Every weekend shift went into that account for eight months. I saved. While Kevin thought I was contributing to our household, what I was really doing was building an. I found an apartment across town. Small, one bedroom, nothing fancy. I paid first and last month rent in cash. I packed a bag and hid it at my friend's house. I made copies of All our important documents. I talked to a lawyer during my lunch breaks. Kevin had no idea. He was too busy counting my hours to notice. I was counting the days until I could leave. Last Tuesday, I came home from my retail shift. And Kevin was sitting at the kitchen table. His face was pale. He was holding

Yeah, I thought I heard something scratching around outside earlier. I shrugged, loading plates into the dishwasher. Probably just a raccoon or something. Why? Her face went completely pale. She grabbed my arm hard enough to hurt. Your grandpa just collapsed in the bedroom. I dropped the plate I was holding and ran upstairs. Door was open and I could see him on the floor next to the bed, his whole body convulsing. His eyes had rolled back in his head and there was white foam coming out of his mouth. I never seen anything like it. Grandpa. I dropped down next to him, my hands shaking so bad I could barely hold my phone to call 9, 1 1. The operator's voice was calm, but I could barely focus on what she was saying. She walked me through turning him on his side so he wouldn't choke. His skin felt cold and clammy under my hands. I kept saying his name, but he wasn't responding at all. Is he breathing? The operator asked. Yes, but it sounds weird, raspy. Help is on the way. Stay with him. Grandma stood in the doorway crying while I knelt there holding his hand. Ten minutes felt like 10 hours. I could hear the sirens getting closer and then suddenly our house was full of paramedics with a equipment and radios crackling. They started Checking his vitals and putting an IV in his arm. One of them kept asking me questions. What medications was he on? I had no idea because Grandpa never talked about that stuff. Any allergies? Unknown. What happened before he collapsed? I don't know. I was downstairs doing dishes. He just came out of the bathroom and then this happened. The paramedics looked at each other with this expression I couldn't read. They loaded him onto the stretcher and one of them said I could ride in the ambulance. I sat in the back holding his hand while they worked on him. His skin still felt cold. We'd been joking around at dinner about him beating me at chess again for the third time this week. He'd been perfectly fine. An hour ago at the hospital, they rushed him through doors I wasn't allowed past. A nurse directed me to the waiting room and I called my mom at work. He said she'd leave immediately. I sat in those awful plastic chairs for three hours. The coffee from the vending machine tasted like dirt, but I drank it anyway. Families came and went. A kid was crying about his broken arm. An old woman was wheeled past in a wheelchair. I just kept staring at the clock. Finally, a doctor came out. He's stable, she's said, but we found something unusual. He has a severe infection from what appears to be an animal bite. We've cleaned the wound and started Strong antibiotics. Where was he bitten? She paused on his buttocks. I blinked his what? We need to monitor him closely, but you can see him soon. When they finally let me into his room, he was hooked up to a bunch of machines, but his color looked better. His eyes were open, saw me and immediately his face twisted into a scowl. This is your fault, he said. First words out of his mouth, Grandpa, what are you talking about? Are you okay? He shifted in the bed and winced. There was a rat in the toilet. A big one climbed in through the bathroom window. When I sat down to do my business, the damn thing bit a chunk out of my backside. My mouth fell open. A sewer rat in our toilet that bit him. I saw it swimming around in there. After continued. Thing was huge, size of a small cat. Okay, but how is that my fault? His finger shook as he pointed at me. If you hadn't locked that window, it could have escaped back outside. Instead, it got trapped and hid in the toilet bowl waiting for someone to sit down. 40 years of home maintenance experience, I know what I know. I stared at him. I've been sitting in this hospital for three hours worried sick. And he was blaming me for locking a window, a basic security measure that any normal person would do. Are you seriously, Grandpa? Locking windows is Normal. That rat could have come from the sewer pipes. Don't take that tone with me, boy. That window was its escape route and you blocked it. I stood up and grabbed my jacket off the chair. My hands were shaking again, but this time from anger. Fine, I'm leaving. I don't give a rat's ass, he called out. As I reached the door, I turned back and looked at him in that hospital bed, stubborn as ever. Clearly you do, Grandpa.

Said he wanted this as much as I did. When the test finally showed two lines, my hands shook so badly, I could barely hold my phone to call him. It was 11:47 a m. On a Tuesday.

He said he'd leave the office right then, be home in 20 minutes. I could hear him grabbing his keys through the phone. He walked in with grocery bags. Pickles, three different ice cream flavors, ginger ale, the cliche pregnancy craving stuff. We both laughed about it. He said he'd been reading articles, wanted to be prepared.

Every time I suggested seeing a fertility specialist, he'd talked me out of it. The grocery bags. He'd bought them on his way home from work. Probably rehearsed his reaction in the car.

Took my documents from the filing cabinet. My grandmother's jewelry. Box the photo albums from before I met him. I left the pregnancy test on his pillow with a single post it note.

They're both cackling, and I'm sitting right here. My mom half smiles like, this is a horrible and not evidence my family convinced me a theme park ceased to exist. Oops! My sister giggles, finally glancing at me. Sorry, I forgot you were still here. She doesn't look sorry. Then my brother nudges my sister. Remember when she got grounded for a month for breaking Mom's face? My sister's eyes go wide. Oh my god. Wasn't that you, though? My brother shrugs. Yeah. Oops. They laugh harder. My mom looks at me and sighs. Don't look so upset. You were always the easy one. Never needed anything from us in the first place. She says it like a compliment. It lands like a grenade. I stopped asking for things years ago. I stopped expecting birthday calls or Christmas presents with my my name spelled right. I built walls so thick, I forgot people were supposed to be on the other side. My mom starts sobbing again about how dad won't let her say goodbye, and then suddenly the hospice nurse appears in the doorway. And says five words that make everyone freeze. He wants to see her. She's pointing at me. My brother says her out loud, like I'm a stranger who wandered in off the street. My sister's mouth drops open.

This might be the dumbest criminal I've ever seen, one cop said, looking at the 3D printed gun. One bullet, really? He just ruined his entire life. He won't see the outside of a cell until he's fifty. He seized Kane's 3D printer from his house. His computer had searches for how to make scary gun, an easiest 3D gun to print. He downloaded the simplest file he could find. But the FBI already flagged him and reported him for his searches. We all visited Missus Copeland at the hospital. She was sitting up when we got there with her arm in a sling. You saved us, I said. You knew about the one bullet. I teach history, she said. I know what real guns look like. That plastic toy could barely hold itself together, let alone multiple rounds. Why didn't you dance? Jazlyn asked. Someone had to make him waste his only bullet.

He was watching everyone with this sick smile. The gun was in his right hand because it was 3D printed and semi transparent. I could see inside it there was only one bullet. The idiot had printed a gun that could only hold one bullet, probably all he could figure out how to make. The song ended. Everyone was panting and crying.

Why now? 30 years of nothing and suddenly I'm the chosen one. I step into the bedroom and see my dad, who looks like a skeleton, eyes sunken and fingers thin. Machines beep around him like a countdown I don't want to witness. He waves me closer and his voice sounds like gravel scraping concrete. I need to tell you something before I go, he raps. You don't belong in this family. Well, you're mine, but you're not your mother's. The air leaves my lungs like someone punched it out. He keeps talking, 31 years ago, I had an affair. Some woman from my office, she died giving birth to you and she had no family to take you in. So suddenly you were my problem. He goes on to tell me the story, story of how he brought me home and that's how my mom found out about the affair. She agreed to raise me so the family wouldn't fall apart, but she could never love me. Every time she looked at me, she saw his betrayal, asking For breakfast, he had to be harsh with me, distant, because if my mom ever thought he favored me over her real kids, she would have left and taken them. Every time he looked at me, he saw his own guilt staring back. Your brother and sister can never know, he whispers. Your mother made me promise they'd never find out. His hand finds mine. I'm sorry. I was a coward. You were innocent in all of this. So I'm not just furniture. I'm haunted furniture. My dad dies three days later. I don't tell anyone what he said.

My brother's jaw actually dropped. My sister's new husband leaned over and whispered something to her. I caught the words, wait, that's your sister? I looked at my family one by one, completely calm. I just wanted to say congratulations to the bride and groom. I know this day is all about you, but I also wanted you to know that I paid for the open bar tonight. And the string quartet. And the champagne you're all drinking, which runs about $300 a bottle. I paused. Moving to San Francisco next week to run my company. Thought you should know before I disappeared. I sat back down. The silence lasted five seconds before someone started clapping. Then more people joined. My dad stood up, tears in his eyes. Suddenly desperate to show how proud he was, he started walking toward me with his arms open. I picked up my glass, took a long sip of the champagne I paid for, and didn't move. I didn't hug my dad. When he reached me, I just nodded and said I should get going. Early flight tomorrow. I left before the cake cutting. My sister grabbed my arm at the door. Why didn't you tell us? I looked at her for the first time in years. Nobody was going. To listen to me, anyway. Remember, I walked out of that ballroom and didn't look back. I'd spent 22 years waiting for my family to notice me. Now they finally had, and I was already gone.

I exist in exactly zero family photos, not because I'm ugly. I mean, I am, but that's not the point. My dad would send me to grab something right before the camera clicked every single time. At my high school graduation, my parents left early because my sister had a dance recital. They saw her do a cartwheel and missed me get my diploma. So when my dad gets diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, the last thing anyone expected was for him to tell mom he wants to see me. Specific. I assume the morphine finally kicked in. Here's the thing, though. He won't let anyone into his room. Not my mom, not my brother, not my sister, nobody. They're all losing their minds about it, huddled in the living room crying and telling stories about him like he's already gone. My mom keeps dabbing her eyes saying he was such a wonderful father.

I grabbed my bag, nearly tripped over the hem of the dress and sprinted out of the fitting room while the seamstress yelled after me to be careful. My mother in law followed, still ranting, but her voice blurred into background noise. I pushed call on my phone. My sister answered in a rush. The venue coordinator says there's a problem with the paperwork. They said if you don't get here in person to sign something, they can't host the wedding. They're threatening to shut it down. What paperwork? I gasped, already pushing through the shop doors and running toward my car. No idea, but they said it has to be you, not me, not mom, not your fiance. If the venue shut down now, hours before hundreds of guests arrive, our entire wedding would collapse. I threw the dress into the passenger seat, ignored the pins still attached and sped out of the parking lot. Adrenaline rushing through me. I stayed on the phone as I drove. Did they say why I never signed whatever it is? That's the crazy part. My sister said they claim someone told them you cancelled. Cancelled. I yelled, why would I? But then it hit me. My future mother in law had been pushing gently at first and then aggressively for us to move the wedding to her friend's country club. She said it was more elegant and that our original venue was too casual.

She said she was authorized to cancel under your name. My mother in law's face went pale. I was trying to help the coordinator cut her off. Ma'am, attempting to cancel a contracted event without authorization is grounds for legal action. The wedding party had begun gathering behind us, so my parents, my fiance, my bridesmaids heard everything. My fiance approached the coordinator. We want to proceed with the wedding. She had no authority. The coordinator nodded, understood. We will honour the original contract. Then she turned to my mother in law. You are banned from interacting with menu staff for the remainder of the day and the wedding will proceed exactly as the bride planned. Every witness nodded. My fiance kissed my forehead. My mother in law sputtered but had nothing left to say. Once the staff hurried off to finish preparations, my fiance pulled me close. Are you okay? I drove here in a half pint dress. I so I've had better afternoons, he laughed softly. We're still getting married today. That's what matters. My mother in law approached, but my father stepped between us. Not right now, he said firmly. She backed away. Cheeks burning, I finally caught my breath and looked at my wrinkled dress in the passenger seat. Someone help me get this thing on properly before I walk down the aisle. Like a crushed napkin, my bridesmaids burst into action, pulling me toward the bridal suite. As we Hurried inside, one of them whispered, honestly, if this is the worst thing that happens today, you're winning.

Then the Tech Crunch headline from last month. 22 year old raises $42 million for AI Diagnostics platform. Then a screenshot of the term sheet with my name on it. The room went dead silent. My dad's champagne flute froze halfway to his mouth. My mom's hand went to her chest. My brother's jaw actually dropped. My sister, there's new husband. Leaned over and whispered something to her. I caught the words, wait, that's your sister? I looked at my family one by one, completely calm. I just wanted to say congratulations to the bride and groom. I know this day is all about you, but I also wanted you to know that I paid for the open bar tonight and the string quartet and the champagne you're all drinking, which runs about $300 a bottle. I paused. I'm moving to San Francisco next week to run my company. Thought you should know before I disappeared. I sat back down. The silence lasted five seconds before someone started clapping. Then more people joined. My dad stood up, tears in his eyes. Suddenly desperate to show how proud he was, he started walking toward me with his arms open. I picked up my glass, took a long sip of the champagne I paid for, and didn't move. I didn't hug my dad. When he reached Me? I just nodded and said I should get going. Early flight tomorrow. I left before the cake cutting. My sister grabbed my arm at the door. Why didn't you tell us? I looked at her for the first time in years. Nobody was going to listen to me anyway. Remember? I walked out of that ballroom and didn't look back. I spent 22 years waiting for my family to notice me. Now they finally had. And I was already gone.

But then I remembered his voice last night, that sad whatever, like he'd accept that he'd never have it again. So I got up and I started batch No. 3. This time I set timers for everything, phone timer, oven timer, even the microwave timer as backup. I watched that pot like my life depended on it. I checked the rice every 90 seconds with a fork. I followed his mom's instructions exactly, measuring everything twice using actual measuring cups instead of eyeballing it. At 6:15, the rice was perfect. The chicken was tender and falling off the bone. The saffron had turned everything this we're just golden color. And the whole house smelled exactly like his childhood home, like his mom's kitchen on the wallie. I plated everything in our nicest serving dish and covered it with oil to keep it warm. Griffin just texted me, they're 20 minutes away. I'm standing in our kitchen right now surrounded by every dirty pot and pan we own. There's spices all over the counter. I have turmeric under my fingernails that won't come out. I used $40 worth of saffron in one dish and I'm still not sure I used enough. But the biryani looks incredible. It smells perfect. And in 20 minutes, my husband is going To walk through that door and smell his mom's cooking for the first time in over a year. I'm terrified this won't taste right. I'm terrified he'll take one bite and know it's wrong. But I'm also hoping that even if it's not perfect, he'll understand that I woke up before sunrise and drove four hours and spent seven hours cooking because I love him. The garage door just opened.

She sat on our couch smirking, making jokes about how I must have trust issues, how if I felt threatened by their friendship, that was my problem, not hers. She even winked at him when she said it. The second she left, I told him I never wanted to see or hear about her again, that if he'd rather have her as a friend than me as a wife, he should just say it. He promised it was over, said he'd barely talk to her work. Only two weeks later, we left for our anniversary trip to Santorini. Three weeks just us. It was supposed to fix everything, except she texted him two to three times every single day. I'd see his phone light up. Autumn, autumn, autumn. He'd wait until I was in the shower to respond or when I fell asleep. Once I woke up at 2:00am and he was on the balcony typing away. When I asked about it, he said she was having marriage problems, that she needed someone to talk to. Are you a marriage counselor now, I asked. He laughed it off. We got home with one week of vacation left, suggested dinner and a movie. I agree. We needed it. We were at the restaurant finally having a Good time. When she walked in with her husband, she spotted us immediately came over. Oh, my god, what a coincidence. Do you guys wanna join us? I said yes before my husband could say no. She was so pleasant.

Every weekend shift at the diner, every birthday check from relatives, every dollar we could scrape together went into our shared savings account. By may, we had two thousand hundred and forty seven dollars, Taylor Swift tickets, Broadway shows, the works. I'll never forget the day we hit $2,000. First. Maya called me screaming and we spent three hours planning every detail, which hotel, which restaurants, even which subway lines we take. I had a whole notebook dedicated to the trip. She had a Pinterest board with 400 pins. Three weeks before we're supposed to leave, Maya text me at eleven PM on a Tuesday. So Chelsea really wants to go to NYC for her birthday and she asked if I'd come with her instead. You understand, right? Chelsea, her childhood best friend from elementary school who moved to California in eighth grade. They see each other maybe twice. It's a year when Chelsea visits her grandparents.

I loaded everything into the trunk and drove home, checking my phone every five minutes, terrified he'd wake up early and text me asking where I was. I got back at 10:30. I sat in the driveway for three minutes just reading. Then I checked through the bedroom door and he was still asleep. So I hauled six grocery bags into the kitchen as quietly as humanly possible. Every plastic bag sounded like a firecracker. I hid everything in the cabinet we never use, the one above the fridge. Then I called his best friend, Griffin, and begged him to take my husband out for the day. I need at least six hours, I said. Griffin asked why, and I just said, trust me, I'll explain later. He showed up at noon and they left to go to some car show two towns over. The second the door closed, I pulled out every pot we own. His mom stayed on Facetime with me for the first hour, walking me through the marination process. More yogurt, she kept saying. No more. You need at least two cups. Trust me. I've been making this for 35 years. I started cooking at one PM the recipe said medium heat, but our stove runs hot and I didn't adjust. The first batch burned because I had the heat too high and I panicked when I smelled it. I dumped the entire pot in the sink and watched $60 worth of chicken and spices go down the drain. The second batch looked promising until I realized the rice was mushy completely.

I surprised him at his office with lunch. That's when I met autumn, his colleague. They were laughing at his desk. And when I walked in, there was this weird pause, like I'd interrupted something. He introduced us, said they've been working together for five years. Five years? And I'd never heard her name. Not once. On the drive home, I asked why he never mentioned her. He said, we rarely talk about work since I don't understand his field. That stuck with me, the way he said it. That night, I started paying attention. He was on his phone constantly, smiling at texts, typing quick responses. During dinner, during movies, even when we were in bed. A week later, I asked him directly, who are you texting so much? He didn't hesitate. He unlocked his phone and handed it to me. See for yourself. I scrolled through their messages. It was pages and pages of daily conversations, cute nicknames, inside jokes. Her complaining about her husband, asking intimate questions about our relationship, about me. Then I found the one that made my stomach drop. My husband's birthday is June 14. I threw him a party. Friends, family, everything. At nine forty seven PM that night, she texted, you must be Bored at your own party or you wouldn't be texting me instead of being with her.

So whatever, that, whatever broke something in me. We're both first gen Indian Americans and since we got married last year, we've been living off chicken and rice because the nearest Indian grocery store is two hours away. I didn't realize how much he missed home until I heard his voice crack talking to his friend. So I made a plan. I set my alarm for 4:30 this morning while he was still asleep. I grabbed the grocery list. His mom texted me at midnight after I called her crying and I just drove. The GPS said two hours and 12 minutes one way. The store opened at 7. I got there at six, 45 and sat in the parking lot watching the sun come up, trying not to think about how I've never made biryani in my entire life. My hands were shaking when I grabbed my coffee. When the doors finally opened, I walked in and immediately felt lost. Just store was huge and everything was labeled in three different languages. I called his mom from aisle three, standing there with my list and she walked me through finding every single ingredient. Dasmati, rice, saffron, $40 for a container. Smaller than my thumb. He got it. Cardamom pods that I had to count out myself. The spices alone cost me 80.

She started flipping through pages, showing me venues, flowers, photographers and catering menus. Everything looked fancy and expensive, really expensive. Dad, I've got everything planned out, he said with this huge smile. The venue is this gorgeous country club downtown. The photographer won Amy's photography award last year. And look at this cake design. I'm looking at these numbers and my eyes are getting wider with each page. The venue alone was $12,000. The photographer was another four grand. The flowers were 3,000.

Ashley flipped to the back page and pointed to a number that made my stomach drop, $47,000 for one day. I know it seems like a lot, she said quickly, but this is my dream wedding. I've been planning this since I was little. And you always said you'd pay for my wedding when I got married. That was true. When she was 8 years old and playing dress up, I did promise I'd pay for her wedding someday, but I was thinking more like 10 or 15,000. Not enough money to buy a new car. Actually, that's almost $50,000. I said that's More than I make in a whole year after taxes.

She wanted me to go into debt or raid my retirement so she could have one expensive party. What does Brandon think about all this? I asked. Brandon was her fiance a nice kid who worked at a car dealership. Oh, he said, whatever makes me happy. Ashley replied, his parents are paying for the honeymoon, so this is all on us. I closed the binder and looked at my daughter, Ashley. I'm not paying for this wedding. Her face went from excited to shocked to angry in about three seconds. What do you mean you're not paying? You promised. I promise to help with your wedding, not bankrupt myself for it. I said $47,000 is insane. She started crying and said I was ruining her dreams, that all her friends had expensive weddings and she'd be embarrassed to have something small and cheap.

So me and my husband have been married about 4 years now. We met in college and got married pretty much right after he graduated with a finance degree and thought he was gonna do accounting. Turns out he hated it. So he bounced around from job to job trying to figure out what he actually wanted to do. He talked about being a teacher for a while, then he wanted to be a lawyer. Then he wanted to start some kind of business. Nothing ever stuck. Then Covid hit and after that, he basically just stopped trying. He kept saying there was gonna be some big job boom after the pandemic and he would find something he was passionate about then. That was years ago. He still hasn't looked for anything. Meanwhile, I've been working full time this entire time. My job went remote, which was nice, but I've basically been keeping us afloat by myself, paying rent, buying groceries, covering all the bills every single month. It's just me making sure we don't end up on the street. So after the fiscal year closed, my company did really well. We sell medical testing equipment. So obviously 2,020 was huge for us. My boss called me into a meeting and told me I was getting a promotion, a little pay raise and a bonus on top of it. I was so excited I almost cried in the Office. You know what I wanted to do with that money? I wanted to fix my purse. My friend's puppy got to it a few months back and chewed the strap off. I know it was my fault for leaving it on a low stool right by the puppy's bed, but still.

I specifically told him I didn't want her there because she makes me uncomfortable. He said he had another talk with her and she understood and promised she wouldn't say anything weird this time. So I said fine. The BBQ was actually going pretty well. Mary showed up and was being normal for once, grilled stuff, people were drinking, playing music in the backyard. By midnight, most people had left and there were only like four of us still hanging out in our living room. I was walking past the couch carrying a glass of red wine when I tripped over the edge of our carpet, like a full stumble and the wine went flying right onto Mary's jeans. I immediately started apologizing. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Let me get you some paper towels. I'll pay for the dry cleaning. I'm so sorry. Mary just stared at her jeans. Then she looked up at me. You did that on purpose? I was like, what? No, I literally tripped. You saw me trip? She stood up and her face was getting red. You're a witch. You've always been a witch. This is part of some ritual, isn't it? I thought she was joking at first, so I kind of nervous laughed bad Move. Don't laugh at me, she said. I know what you're doing. You're trying to ruin my life.

He sat in my living room looking really uncomfortable. Mister Davis said, I need to tell you something. I had no idea Ashley wanted to spend that much money. When she told me 47,000, I almost choked. Turns out Brandon had been trying to talk Ashley into something smaller for months. He wanted to use their money for a down payment on a house instead of one expensive party. I was actually hoping you'd say no, he admitted. I didn't know how to tell her we couldn't afford it without sounding unsupportive. Three days later, Ashley called me crying. But this time it was different. She apologized and said she'd been talking to some of her married friends about their wedding debt. One couple was still paying off their wedding loan three years later. Another friend's parents had to delay retirement because of wedding costs. I don't want you to struggle financially because of my party, she said through tears. Brandon and I found a really nice park Pavilion that cost $300 to rent. We ended up having the Wedding at the state park by the lake. Ashley's mom and I helped with decorating, her aunt made the cake and Brandon's cousin DJ at the reception. The whole thing cost $4,200 and it was absolutely beautiful.

My girlfriend Lily and I had been together for two years, and everything was perfect when it was just us. She tell me she loved me every morning, leave cute notes in my lunch, and plan these elaborate date nights. Every Friday. We talked about moving in together, getting married someday, maybe having kids. She even had my mom's ring size saved in her phone for when I was ready to propose. But whenever my best friend Connor came around, Lily turned into a different person. It started small at first. Connor would join us for dinner, and Lily would laugh about how she was only with me for my Netflix password. Everyone would laugh, but something felt off. Then it escalated. My birthday party. Connor made a toast about finding your person, and Lily loudly said she was still looking for hers while sitting right next to me. Twenty people went silent. When I asked her about it later, she said it was obviously a joke and I was being insecure. At game night, Connor asked how we met, and Lily said she lost a bet with her roommate and had to go on a date with me, but figured she'd stick around until someone better came along. Connor looked uncomfortable and changed the subject. Lily rubbed my shoulder and said, I knew she was kidding. Connor's housewarming. Someone asked when we were getting engaged, and Lily said she'd rather marry Connor than laugh like it was hilarious. Connor left his own kitchen to avoid the awkwardness. Lily told me I had no sense of humor. The pattern was obvious. Me and Lily meant love and affection. Add Connor to the mix and suddenly I was a placeholder she barely tolerated. When Connor wasn't around, she'd apologize and say she got nervous in groups and made bad jokes, but it only happened around him, never with other friends. I tried talking to Connor about it, but he just said Lily was probably dealing with something and to give her space.

No tears of relief, no rushing to hug me, just my mother standing by the door with her arms crossed, frowning, while my dad scratched his head like he didn't know what to do now that I woke up. To make it worse, I couldn't remember anything, not the accident, not my childhood, not even my own name until they told me. But something in my gut told me these people weren't happy I was alive. When the doctor finally left, my mother forced a smile. Let's get you home. And that was it. No, we missed you so much. Or thank god you're okay. I figured they were just too shocked, maybe too tired of waiting for me to get better. But it ended up being so much worse than that. At home, I wasn't treated like someone recovering from a coma. I was treated like a servant. My mother had me scrubbing floors and my dad had me clearing leaves from the roof. There was no family time together, nothing but chores. But slowly, fragments of my memory started coming back, like living in a different house, different room, different nickname. At some point, I brought it up to my parents. You remember what beach we went to a couple years ago, I asked. My mom's eyes went wide just for a second. Before she smiled, oh, honey, those weren't memories. They're just illusions. The doctors warned us it might happen, she said. My dad nodded along. Your brain is healing. Don't trust everything it tells you. I eventually stopped asking when I realized that every time I remembered something new, they just treated me like I was losing my mind. And honestly, after several days of them telling me my brain was broken, I started believing them. Then one day I went back to the hospital for a follow up check up. I was sitting in the waiting room when someone called out my nickname.

No kids, no marriage, no boyfriend. The biggest meaning in my life is my evening drinks. Every morning before work, I pick two glasses from the cabinet and put them in the fridge to chill. But that day, my hand froze on the cabinet door at work. I kept making mistakes. My boss noticed something was wrong and gave me the day off. I went to a temple and sat with a group of people seeking answer. The head monk tapped our shoulders with a wooden board and asked about our troubles. Everyone stared at me in confusion. To them, it sounded trivial. But for me, evening drinks were the reason I was alive. Every day I looked forward to making them better. Lately, nothing satisfied me anymore. The monk wrote two words, let go. She told me that obsession can lead you astray and that maybe I should keep a little distance from my evening ritual. In that moment, something inside me clicked. So instead of going home to drink, I walked straight into an izakaya I was about to order when I saw people drinking beer from unshilled glasses, their side dishes just plain fried shrimp, chips. I thought of my own ice chilled glasses and carefully prepared snacks. I couldn't stand it and ran out. Suddenly, ideas flooded my head. I rushed into a supermarket and grabbed a box of eel. Back home, I put the glasses in the freezer to chill fast. Then I Headed to the kitchen, I simmered the eel in tea to remove its smell. Sliced cucumbers, shaved burdock, grated yam beat eggs, a light cold dish, rich yum, eggs, simmered eel. Finally, a steaming bowl of eel chazuk. Everything was ready. I took out the frozen glasses, poured the ice cold beer and took a big sip. Familiar happiness rushed back. In that moment, I found my reason to live again. I no longer cling to the idea that I must be happy because this gentle buzz right now is already the best answer.

My daughter's name is Isla, pronounced Aila. It's not that hard. I named her after my grandmother, who raised me when my parents couldn't get their act together. That name means everything to me, but apparently Missus Wilson at Jefferson Elementary couldn't be bothered to learn it. Every single day for three weeks, she called my kid Isla during attendance. My daughter would quietly correct her, and this teacher would just nod and move on, then make this same mistake the next day. At first I thought it was just an honest mistake. People mess up names all the time. But then my daughter started coming home upset, saying some of the other kids were copying the teacher and calling her ice girl or asking if she was cold. Seven year olds can be brutal when adults set the wrong example. I decided to handle it diplomatically. I sent a polite email explaining the pronunciation with a little memory trick I love. Like I can see the beautiful island. Super simple, right? Missus Wilson replied saying she'd make sure to get it right going forward. The next week, still calling her Isla, my daughter asked me why her teacher wouldn't say her name right when all her friends could do it. I told her I'd fix it. So I showed up to the classroom during pickup time. Missus Wilson was there organizing papers, and I walked right up to her desk with My biggest smile. Hi there, Missus Wilson, I said, pronouncing each syllable super clearly. I wanted to chat about my daughter Aislah's name situation. She looked up, confused. Oh, you mean aislah? Actually, that's what I want to discuss. You've been calling her Iceland for almost a month now. Her name is Isla, like the word I. Missus Wilson got this defensive look and said, well, I've been saying it the way it's spelled. I S L A. Sounds like Iceland to me. That's when I lost my diplomacy. Missus Wilson, your name is spelled W I L S O N. If I followed your logic, I'd call you Mrs. Wilson instead of Mrs. Wilson. Does that sound right to you? She actually rolled her eyes. That's different. Wilson is a common name. Different how? Because my daughter's name isn't common enough for you to care about getting it right. She corrects you every single day, and you ignore her. You're teaching her that her voice doesn't matter. The room went dead quiet. A few other parents had walked in during my little speech. And we're just standing there watching this play out. Missus Wilson's face turned red. I don't appreciate being lectured about how to do my job. I have 30 students, and I can't be expected to. To learn their names. That's literally the bare minimum of your job. Then she made her fatal mistake. She stood up and said, maybe if you'd given your daughter a normal American name. We wouldn't have this problem. The audacity. I saw red. Excuse me? A normal American name. My daughter was born in Chicago. Her great grandmother was born in Ohio. How much more American do you want? And even if she wasn't, every child in your classroom deserves to have their name pronounced correctly. By now, the other parents were fully invested in this drama. One mom was not so subtly. Recording on her phone. Missus Wilson realized she'd screwed up. I didn't mean it that way. What way did you mean it, then? Because it sounds like you think some names matter more than others. I tried to backtrack, but I was done. Mrs. Wilson, here's what's going to happen. Tomorrow morning, you're going to apologize to my daughter for consistently mispronouncing her name and ignoring her corrections. And you're going to practice saying Aila until you get it right. Because if I hear you've messed it up even once more, I'm going straight to Principal Smith. I turned to walk out, then stopped. Oh, and Missus Wilson. My daughter's name is beautiful. It means island in Spanish. Islands are strong and surrounded by water, but they never sink. Just like my kid won't sink because of your laziness. The next morning, Missus Wilson did apologize to Isla in front of the whole class. She never mispronounced her name again.

And I don't feel guilty about it. My wife was always very close with her parents. And when they passed away in a car crash five years ago, she went into a deep slump. She wouldn't leave her bed. And I took on every chore and cared for our Newborn by myself. The problem is it's been like this for five years. For five years she hasn't left her bed and I mean that literally. She expected me to cook her meals and when I was at work, she ordered take out. We hadn't had intimacy in five years. I didn't remember the last time she kissed me. She barely speaks to our six year old daughter. I did every household chore myself. I worked 60 hour weeks. I finally worked up the courage and I decided to put my foot down about everything for the sake of our kids, for me and especially for her. I sat next to her on the bed, took her hand gently in mine and spoke softly. I know it's hard. It's been really hard for both of us. But we can't keep going on like this, stuck in this endless sadness. Our kid missed you. I miss you too. I miss hearing your laugh and seeing your smile. Please, for all of us, can you try to take even a small step forward with me, I asked her. She looked back. At me. I saw a singular tear fall down her cheek. He squeezed my hand weakly and said, I don't know if I can. I was beginning to lose my patience. I told her she had to get up. She had to. I didn't care how sad she felt, she had to get up. She went silent. The air felt heavy. And then I said that I couldn't keep doing this alone. I was tired. She told me that I had no idea of how it felt to lose my parents and refused to speak to me after that. I yelled, you're seriously telling me I don't understand what it's like to lose someone? You were getting your master's degree. You were studying to be something while you were in school. I supported you through everything. I paid for your tuition. I paid for the house that we're living in. I worked almost 70 hours a week to put food on the table for us while trying to be there for our kids. You remember it? During that time, Andrew died. My own brother and I couldn't even attend his funeral because I had to work to put food on our table. When drew died, I didn't have time to mope around and stay in the bed every day. I had to get up and work even harder for you, for us. I was still here for you when you decided to leave school in the middle of the semester. I still paid for the full class. When you needed therapy, I paid for it. Whenever you needed a shoulder to cry on or someone to be strong for you, I did it. I was there. I was depressed. Kaylee. I didn't wanna get out of bed in the morning. I didn't wanna be the only one taking care of Connor, taking him to school every day before I work a 10 hour shift and not being able to greet him as he gets off the bus. I'm not trying to invalidate your feelings, but after five years of grieving, I'm tired. Kaylee didn't say anything. She just looked at me. I asked her if she had anything to say and she stayed silent. This infuriated me because it felt like I was talking to a brick wall. I woke Connor up and I left the house for the night and got a hotel. I needed some space away. On the drive there, Connor asked me why mom wasn't coming with us and I told him that she would rather stay in the bed because she needed some rest. After we left, she kept calling me and texting me. I texted her back that I would see her in the morning and she sent a text to come back home that instant. But I needed some space from her. I turned my phone on do not disturb, put Connor to bed and got his clothes ready for school the next Morning, while he was asleep, I started writing a letter to give to Kaylee.

So for context, I've had this routine since like forever. Every night after dinner, I eat one of those tiny joy mini cups of ice cream. You know the ones, they're basically the size of a shot glass with a baby scoop of vanilla or chocolate, sometimes strawberry if I'm feeling wild. Literally my one thing, I don't drink, I don't smoke. I work a boring office job where I answer emails about printer paper orders all day. This ice cream is the only excitement in my life. My brother Josh and his wife Kelly moved in with me for a few weeks because they're between houses. They sold their old place and the new one isn't ready yet. So I said they could crash at my apartment. Their daughter Mia is 5 and honestly pretty cute. She's obsessed with dinosaurs and asks a million questions about everything. Everything was fine at first. We'd eat dinner together. They'd go watch TV in the living room and I'd have my ice cream in the kitchen. Simple. But then one night Kelly cornered me while I was pulling out my mini cup from the freezer. She was like, hey, so I need to ask you something. I thought maybe she wanted to borrow my car or something. Nope. Could you maybe not eat ice cream? Every night while we're here, Mia keeps asking why she can't have any and it's making things really difficult. I just stared at her for a second because I genuinely didn't know what to say. Like, this is my house and my ice cream. I tried to be nice about it. I said, I get it, but I'm not gonna stop. I can wait until Mia is in bed though. Would that work? Kelly seemed okay with that, so I thought problem solved. Wrong. The next night I waited until like 8:30 when Mia was supposedly asleep. I grabbed my mini cup and sat at the kitchen table. Not even two minutes later, Mia came running in asking for ice cream. Kelly rushed in behind her looking super annoyed and took Mia back to bed. This happened three more times that week. Every single time I tried to eat my ice cream after Mia went to bed, she'd somehow appear in the kitchen like a little ice cream seeking ghost. And every time Kelly would give me this look like I was personally ruining her life. Finally, Kelly came into the kitchen one night before I even opened the freezer. She crossed her arms and was like, okay, seriously, do you need to eat ice cream every single day? Like, is it actually necessary? I was getting pretty annoyed at this point so I said, no, but you also don't need to drink a glass of wine every night either. Her face went red. She'd been having wine with dinner literally every night since they moved in. I never said anything about it. She just huffed and walked away without saying anything else. But then it got worse. She started making these passive aggressive comments at dinner. Like when I'd finish eating, she'd be like, oh, going for your ice cream now in this super sarcastic tone. Or she tell me a really loudly, remember, sweetie, we only have treats on special days, not every single day like some people. My Brother Josh eventually pulled me aside and asked if I could just stop eating ice cream until they moved out. He said Kelly was stressed about the move and I was making things harder. I told him, no, it's my apartment, my freezer, my ice cream. I'm not changing my routine because Kelly can't explain to her kid that different people have different rules. Josh got kind of mad and said I was being selfish and that it's only a couple more weeks. I said that if it's such a problem, maybe they should consider staying somewhere else. He didn't like that at all. Things got super awkward after that. Kelly would barely talk to me. She'd make dinner for her family and leave me out. So I started ordering takeout. Mia kept asking why everyone was acting weird, which honestly made me feel bad because none of this is her fault. One night I was eating my ice Cream at the kitchen table and Mia snuck in again, but this time before Kelly could come get her.

And now, with her struggles to conceive, my parents want her to share my baby. My sister Vanessa, showed up to my wedding wearing a white dress, not cream, not ivory, pure white with a veil headband. When I saw her walk into the church, I froze. Mom rushed over and whispered that Vanessa was just expressing herself and I shouldn't make a scene on my big day. So I didn't. But that wasn't even the worst part. During the reception, Vanessa stood up during the best man speech and announced she had something to share. She pulled out her phone and started playing a video on the projector screen we'd set up for our slideshow. It was a compilation of all my awkward middle school photos, the ones where I had braces and that terrible haircut. She titled it before Jake made her pretty. My husband Jake, just stared. Half the guests laughed nervously. The other half looked horrified. I left my own reception and cried in the bathroom for 20 minutes. Jake found me and said we should just go. We skipped our first dance and left early. Mom called the next day saying Vanessa was just joking around and I was being too sensitive. Dad said Vanessa was going through a hard time because her boyfriend, Austin, had just dumped her. So I should understand. Two years later, Jake and I found out I was pregnant. We, we were so happy. We Waited until I was 12 weeks to tell anyone. When we went to my parents house for Sunday dinner and shared the news, mom cried happy tears. Dad hugged Jake. Then Vanessa went quiet. She stood up from the table, grabbed her purse and left without saying anything. Mom texted me that night saying Vanessa had been trying to get pregnant with her new husband, Owen, for over a year with no luck. I should have told Vanessa privately first so she could process it. I didn't respond. When I was 6 months pregnant, mom started calling more often. She'd ask about nursery plans, baby names, all, all normal stuff. Then she casually mentioned how Vanessa was seeing a fertility doctor, how the treatments were expensive, how hard it was on her marriage. I'd say, that's tough, and change the subject. After my daughter Ruby was born, things got weird fast. Vanessa showed up at the hospital uninvited. She pushed past Jake and went straight to the baby. She picked Ruby up without asking and started crying, saying she looked just like our family. The nurse had to tell her to.

I warned her not to do it, but she did it anyways, saying, it's my body, my choice. Now she and her family is begging me, but I am clear. Not my baby, not my problem. My name is Brian Torres. I'm 34 years old, and my life imploded on a Tuesday night Last October. My wife Amanda and I had been married for eight years. We had three kids. Tyler, who is 7, Madison, who is six, and Lily, who is four. We were your typical middle class family. We struggled with bills, but we managed. That night, Amanda dropped a bomb. She told me she had agreed to be a surrogate for her boss, David Richardson, and his wife Catherine. They had suffered multiple miscarriages and couldn't safely carry a child. Amanda said it was the right thing to do and added that David was offering $25,000. I told her immediately that this was insane. Carrying another man's baby would destroy our marriage. She rolled her eyes and said it was just a medical procedure. When I pushed back, she hit me with the line that ended everything. It's my body, my choice. I don't need your permission. Over the next three months, tried everything to change her mind. I reminded her how miserable her pregnancies had been. I asked what our kids would think when they saw their mother pregnant with someone else's child. I warned Her about the emotional toll. Nothing worked. Her entire family backed her up. Her sister Olivia called me selfish. Her mother Patricia cornered me after church and said I should be proud of Amanda's sacrifice. Finally, I gave Amanda a direct warning. If you do this, our marriage is over. She looked me straight in the eyes and said, then maybe you should rethink what being a husband means. Three months later, she walked into the kitchen holding a positive pregnancy test. She gave me a triumphant smile and said, it worked. I'm pregnant. I said one word. Okay. Then I called a divorce lawyer. Two days later, Amanda was served with divorce papers at her office, she called me, sobbing, unable to believe I was serious. Even David called, trying to guilt trip me about abandoning her during the pregnancy. I told him straight it was his baby, not mine, and therefore his problem, not mine. The next nine months were hell. Amanda refused to move out. She set up a nursery in our guest room. She kept asking me for help as if I was still her husband. Whenever she asked me to assemble baby furniture, pick up supplies, or drive her to appointments, I would repeat the same line every time. Not my baby, not my problem. When she went into labor, she called me repeatedly, panicking because David was in a meeting and Catherine was at a spa. I hung up and went back to work. After the birth, the begging began.

Dozens of people poured into the room, glaring at me. My parents, her parents, my best friend, and even a lawyer were all there to witness the greatest misunderstanding of all time. So I told my wife I needed to focus for two hours because I had an important commitment with friends. I locked my office door and put a cute little do not disrupt sign on the outside. My wife ended up walking by and hearing me through the door, growling, yeah, baby, just like that. That's exactly what I've been asking for. She froze and pressed her ear against the door. Or oh, Adam, you're so good at this! A high pitched feminine voice said, giggling, are you staying on all night? I need you. My wife's hands started shaking, her heart pounded. She heard me laugh and say something about getting dirty and going all night, stumbled to our bedroom and sat on the bed staring at nothing. When I came out two hours later, I kissed her goodnight like nothing happened, not realizing that my wife was already brewing up a plan on how she'd end me. My wife started sitting beside my locked door, secretly recording all of the suspicious sessions on her phone. She caught the Female voice taunting Adam is that the best you can do? And me responding with I'm gonna destroy you so hard. Yes!

But when I got to the living room, not a single kid in sight. Then I heard my mom's voice. He sounded upset and was saying, why didn't she come? Didn't she get the invitation? But it says today on it. She was asking other parents why their kids didn't come, calling multiple of them, all getting boring excuses. And when I rounded the corner, I saw Jamie sitting alone on the couch, still wearing his little birthday crown and surrounded by balloons. The bouncy house in the backyard stood empty. The cotton candy machine was full. And I saw him crying by himself. Nobody came for him. Mom made call after call. Some parents said their kids were suddenly sick or tired. I couldn't believe it. I felt my own tears coming and knew I couldn't let Jamie see me like this. He was alone on his birthday and I didn't want him to see me crying either. I just turned around and went back to my room before he saw me. It was the saddest thing I've ever seen and I didn't know what to do. So I called my boyfriend to hopefully try and cheer me up. But the second I said hello to him, he instantly heard it all in my voice. Hey, what's going on? Is everything okay? He asked. Nothing. It's just my little brother spent all week planning his party and nobody came. Not one kid. He's devastated. I don't Know what to do. There was a pause, then he goes, okay, I'm coming over and hung up before I could say anything. I thought he'd come over to rub my back or bring me a matcha, but little did I know he had a plan. I had no idea what to expect. Twenty minutes later, the doorbell rang and my mom opened it to find my boyfriend standing there with five of his college friends, guys I knew from his basketball team, all 6 foot plus athletes holding little gift bags for him. Where's the birthday boy? My boyfriend asked loudly and Jamie peeked out from behind mom, his eyes red and puffy from crying. Hey, buddy. My boyfriend dropped to his knees to get on Jamie's level. Sorry we're late to your party. You're Jamie, right? Your sister told us you're the cool a six year old in town. Jamie looked confused but nodded slowly. Then one of them goes, whoa, is that a bouncy house? Then they all go, no way. This is so sick. And just like that, he was hooked. Six college basketball players were taking off their shoes and piling into a bouncy house meant for first graders. Their heads nearly touching the roof, all giving him the time of his life. I slowly saw Jamie smile, come back. They played every single party game mom had planned, all hyping him up. When he got to break open his pinata, when he knocked it Down. They all cheered. Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, while lifting him up in the air. Then my boyfriend took out a wrapped gift for him. And I have literally no idea how he knew what Lego Jamie wanted because his little face lit up when he saw what it was. They all sang Happy Birthday to him and that's when Jamie started crying again. He hugged both of us and blew out his candles with tears in his eyes. He was so freaking happy that by the end of the night, he completely forgot about those kids who didn't come to his awesome party. He was completely exhausted by the end of the day. And as I put him to bed, he goes, they said I can hang out with them anytime. Do you think they meant it? I assured him they did. He slept like a baby that night. I'm marrying him.

Like, okay, let me explain. I've had a lot of friends my whole life. And when I say a lot, I mean I've never really been alone. There's always been someone I can hang out or just chat with them, but it's like no one really cares about me. I feel like none of them actually care about me. I could go weeks, months, even years without texting someone and not a single one of my 300 contacts would hit me up with a, hey, how's it going? Like, come on. The other day I asked my best friend to hang out and he was like, sorry, I'm super sick and my parents won't let me go out. And I was like, yeah, no worries. Well, cause, I mean, that's normal, right? But then a few hours later, I open up Instagram and I'm just watching stories of people because I'm bored all damn day. Then I see his story and he's out with like 47 fucking people behind him. Like, what do you mean about you're really sick? I didn't even bother asking him because I didn't want to argue. And the worst part, those same people are the ones who come running to me whenever they need something. And after I help them, they're like, Omg, thank you. You're literally the best friend ever. Like, bro, fuck off. Anyway, that's it. I'm out.

I was at a nail salon getting my French tips done when. Then the door gently opened and this huge guy walked in. Broad shoulders, full beard, construction boots, covered in dust. The kind of man who looks like he builds houses with his bare hands. He was holding hands with a little girl who couldn't have been older than six. They walked up to the counter. He cleared his throat. Two appointments, please. One for her, one for me. They sat down at the stations. The nail tech smiled at the little girl. What color do you want, sweetie? She lit up like a Christmas tree. Sparkly pink. The tech turned to the dad. And for you, sir? His voice dropped, almost a whisper. Same color. We're matching today. The dad was nervous as soon as the nail tech started working. You could see it in everything he did. The way he kept his shoulders hunched, the way he kept glancing around to see if people were watching. They were. Everyone was. Including me. We all have the same question. Why was he getting his nails done? His daughter noticed him tense up. She reached over and squeezed his big hand with her tiny fingers. It's okay, daddy. You're gonna look so pretty. He smiled at her, but his eyes were still darting around the room. For a few minutes, everything was fine. Just the sound of Nail files. Then a voice cut through the salon. I'm sorry, but is no one going to say anything? I turned around. Woman in her 50s getting acrylics done two chairs over. Designer bag, expensive highlights, face full of judgment. He was staring directly at the man. This is a women's safe space. The dad's whole body tensed up. He didn't respond, just stared down at his hands. His daughter stopped swinging her legs. She looked confused. You're making everyone in here uncomfortable. The woman continued, gesturing dramatically at the room. Isn't he making you all uncomfortable? Nobody answered. We were all too shocked to speak. She took our silence as agreement. See? They're all scared of you. They won't even say it out loud because they don't know what you'll do. The dad finally spoke. Voice low, calm. Ma'am, I'm just trying to be here for my daughter. Please leave us alone. She shot back. No, this is weird. This is creepy. I'm not going to pretend it's okay. The little girl's face was starting to crumble. Then the woman did something unforgivable. She leaned forward in her chair, looked directly at the little girl. Sweetie, do you think this is normal? Your daddy getting his nails done like a little girl? The dad shot to his feet. Do not talk to her! Oh, now he's getting aggressive. Everyone see that? She looked around the room. This is what I was worried about. Violent and creepy. Dad sat back. Down. His jaw was clenched. But the woman kept going. What kind of man comes into a nail salon and asks for sparkly pink polish? She laughed to herself. I'll tell you what kind. The kind who's looking for excuses to creep on women. The dad said nothing, just held his daughter's hand. Woman tilted her head. What does your wife think about you checking out other women, huh? Does she know you're here? The dad's whole body went rigid. His daughter looked up at him. Her eyes were filling with tears. He still didn't answer. The salon manager finally came out from the back room. Ma'am, I'm going to need you to lower your voice. Lower my

When I was 19, I actually got one with huge tank tops. She was sweet, shy and so obedient that she'd ask for my permission before sneezing. But soon I realized she had zero personality and used to say, sorry, honey, even when I farted. So I decided I needed a girl who could stand up for herself. In college, I dated a confident girl who once slapped a guy for just touching my shoulder. She was wild, fearless and loud. She was too much fearless. She once threw her phone at a toddler just because he looked rude. And she also tried to set my neighbor's car on fire because she thought it was parked too close to hers. So I decided I needed someone more peaceful. At 25, I met a calm and composed woman. She did yoga, drank herbal tea and even read books about moon energy. But she was so calm that even when we do it, she just whisper, let's align our chakras, honey. One time she took two hours to just meditate before we actually get into action and I just fell asleep. So I moved on again. At 28, I met a girl who was rich, bold and a total party animal. Life with her was fun until she made me rob an ATM wearing nothing but a Spider Man mask and pink heels. I somehow got arrested and spent a night in jail next to a man named Sniffy Gary, who kept licking my ear. After that disaster, I just gave up on women for a while. Then one day, I met a quiet, sweet dude at my gym. He complimented my deadlifts, offered me protein shakes and never tried to ruin my life. And it's been three months now. I'm happily engaged to him. We even have matching pajamas that say, no more girls, just gains.

It all started when she would bury her head under my skirt. She kept challenging me to climb an old treehouse, which I finally did, only to realise she could see up my skirt as I climbed. I screamed at her to stop looking and she acted like I was disgusting for thinking she was looking. The whole situation was super weird, so I just let it go and never mentioned it again. A few months later, I caught her looking at my photos on my phone. Of course, a big fight happened and my parents got involved. She told them she was trying to delete an ugly photo I had taken of her. Somehow my parents saw it as if we were both in the wrong. I didn't have anything scandalous there, but it just felt so wrong for her to be looking at my photos. Two years later, when we were moving to a new house, my sister and I found out we would be sharing the same bathroom. My sister acted annoyed, but I could see the smile on her face. She never knocked when I was in the shower. Instead, she just tried to see if the door was locked. Eventually, the inevitable happened. I forgot to lock the door and she barged in. Fortunately, I was still dressed. I told my parents about it, and instead of The solution being that she should knock. The solution was that I should use the guest bathroom downstairs. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse, it did. A few nights ago, after a family barbecue, I went back to my room and noticed that the pants I had changed out of before everyone arrived were out of the laundry basket and on the floor. When I got up to do the laundry the next morning, I realised that the underwear I was wearing with those pants was missing. I wanted to scream my sister's name and storm into her room, but it would be pointless. The idea of confronting her about it and her trying to manipulate me again was so exhausting that I simply didn't say anything. I knew my younger sister was guilty, but I had no concrete proof, and I was sure that if I confronted her or told my parents, she would just try to manipulate me again and make me feel crazy. As I suspected, a few days later I noticed that some of my white and black underwear were missing from my dresser, but this time I didn't say anything and acted like I didn't know anything. The next part of my plan was a bit sneaky, as I suspected. A few days later I noticed that some of the white and black underwear were missing from my dresser, but this time I didn't say anything and acted like I didn't know anything. The next part of my plan was a bit sneaky. I was thinking about how to make her hit on me or something like that, so I could record it and show my parents. So I decided on something. My parents were going to another city for the wedding of two of their friends. That day would be perfect to put the plan into action. So the day arrived. I thought of all the ways to provoke her, and the most effective way I found was to pretend I was using the bathroom and stay inside wearing only the bottom of my bikini, waiting for her to barge in, as she always did. As expected, she broke in through the door as usual. But I didn't expect the reaction she had. She stood there staring at me as if she wanted to pounce on me, like a wolf looks at its prey defensively, but at the same time with a scared expression. This time I did it differently. I didn't scream, I didn't move away, I didn't make a scene. I just looked into her eyes with a tempting expression. I smiled and asked, do you like what you see? She was startled again and said, of course. I've always hoped for this sight. At that moment, I knew my plan was going to work.

In my house, nobody cried alone. Ever. My dad made this rule when my older brother Jake came home from school with a black eye and tried to hide in the bathroom to cry. Dad just sat outside the door and said, you can cry, but not by yourself. I was eight and thought it was the weirdest thing. Like, why couldn't I just go to my room and be sad? If I got a bad grade or some kid at school was mean to me, I try to sneak off to cry, but someone always showed up. Mom, Dad, or Jake would just sit down next to me. They wouldn't say anything. They just be there. At first it felt annoying. I remember thinking, can I just be sad alone for five minutes? But then something weird happened. It actually helped, like, way more than I expected. The rule became automatic in our house. If you saw someone tearing up, you didn't ask questions or try to fix it. You just joined them. Even when my friends came over. They Learned fast. One time, my friend Chloe was crying over some drama with this boy she liked during a sleepover. Without even thinking, I sat down next to her on my bedroom floor. I didn't say anything, just handed her some tissues and sat there. Later, she told me it was the nicest thing anyone had. Ever done for her? Most people either ignored her when she cried or tried to give her advice she didn't want. She said just having someone sit with her made her feel less alone. Things got more intense when mom got diagnosed with cancer. I was in sixth grade and didn't really understand what that meant, but I knew it was bad from how quiet everyone got. The crying rule became even more important then. I remember one night I came downstairs to get water and found dad crying at the kitchen table. He was just sitting there with his head in his hands, trying to be quiet. I grabbed a spoon and the jar of peanut butter from the counter and sat down next to him. I handed him a spoonful, and he looked up at me with red eyes and smiled a little. Thanks, kiddo, he said. You remember the rule? We sat there eating peanut butter straight from the jar until he stopped crying. He never told me what was wrong, but I knew it was about mom. The next morning, he seemed better, like sharing that moment helped him handle whatever he was dealing with. When mom started chemo, she cried a lot, but we all took turns sitting with her. Sometimes all four of us would pile onto her bed and just be there while she let it out. Jake would bring his homework. Dad would read the newspaper. I'd play games on my phone. We weren't trying to cheer her up or make her stop. We were just making sure she wasn't alone. The hardest part was when Jake left for college. He called one night during his first week, really crying. I could hear it in his voice, even though he was trying to hide it. Dad put the phone on speaker, and we all sat around it while Jake talked about feeling homesick and overwhelmed. Even through the phone, we followed the rule. Now I'm in college, too, and I still do it without thinking. My roommate Emma had a total breakdown last month over failing a test. She was sobbing on her bed, and I just sat down on the floor next to her. I didn't try to tell her it would be okay or that one test didn't matter. I just sat there. After about 20 minutes, he stopped crying and looked at me. Why are you just sitting there? She asked. I shrugged. It's just what we do in my family. Nobody cries alone. She stared at me for a second, then started crying again. But this time it was different. She told me later that she'd never had someone just be with her when she was upset. Her family always tried to fix everything or told her to stop being dramatic. She said having me just sit there made her feel like it was okay to be sad. My friends think it's weird at first, but they get Used to it

I kept telling her to keep her distance, but she just say, why are you so petty? They're all like brothers from the old neighborhood. Fine. I immediately called my female friend who just returned from overseas. My wife wasn't happy about that. My wife stayed out all night again. I scrolled through Snapchat and saw a new video posted by Asher Hayes, one of my wife's guy friends. My wife was in a crowd of men, glass in hand, beaming. I didn't feel a flicker of anger. I turned off my phone, didn't call her incessantly like I used to. I slept straight through till morning. The next day, my wife came home with breakfast, her heavy smudge makeup still on. She looked at me trying to be sweet and started to explain, darling, I'm so sorry. Asher just got back so everyone gathered for a reunion. It got super late and I didn't want to disturb your sleep, so I just stayed at a hotel with them. But don't worry, honey, I didn't share a bed with any of them this time. She specifically emphasized that she hadn't slept in the same bed as Asher last time she stayed out. We had a huge fight. I was furious that she was a married woman yet she had absolutely no boundaries. Out drinking with guys every other night. But my wife cried, calling me petty. She swore they were all like brothers. From the old neighborhood, her best guy friends. Just thinking about her best guy friends made my blood boil. Asher Hayes was the one I resented most. Asher was Maya's childhood sweetheart. They'd grown up together. In today's terms, Asher was Maya's closest male confidant, her male bestie. But to me, their relationship had no boundaries whatsoever. More than once I've seen a drunk Maya snuggled into Asher's arms, playfully whining. They even shared the same drinking glass. Completely unbothered at first, my wife would patiently explain things to me. She'd reassure me, give me peace of mind. But as time went on, she grew increasingly impatient. She just throw one line at me. Asher and I have absolutely nothing going on. If something was going to happen between us, it would have happened already. You wouldn't even be my husband. Of course, her guy friends all chimed into reason with me. We grew up together. We've always treated Maya like our little sister. Don't take it the wrong way, alright? We're just like family. Family. What kind of brother and sister sit on each other's laps and feed each other? It made my stomach churn. I told my wife countless times that I was uncomfortable. I didn't like her going out with them at night. Later, I don't know how it reached her guy friends ears. Suddenly her good brother started making snide, passive aggressive remarks about me. Oh, Maya, don't drink anymore. Your husband will blame us for Getting you drunk, dude. Maya is all yours now. We wouldn't dare take her home anymore. They said all these things right to my face. Gradually, they all started to think I was petty, not a real man at all. My relationship with my wife also started to cool. Snapping back to reality, my wife handed me a freshly made coffee. She wrapped her arms around me from behind. Husband, are you still mad? Don't be mad, please. They're just friends to me. You're way more important. I didn't say anything. Don't be mad. Let's go on a trip next week, just the two of us, a romantic away. Haven't you always wanted to go hiking? I'll go with you. I'm an outdoor enthusiast. I love hiking. I tried to get Maya to go with me before, but she had absolutely no interest in it. Her friends even laughed at me when they found out. Hiking, is that what old people do? Our Princess Maya can't get a tan on a mountain? Gradually, I stopped bringing it up. Now my wife was actually suggesting it herself. A flicker of hope ignited inside me. Seeing my expression soften, my wife beamed. She immediately promised she'd arrange everything for the hiking trip. My wife had been well behaved these past few days. She hadn't gone out to parties at night. But today I saw Asher post his hiking photos. It was the exact mountain I wanted to climb. And in the corner, Of one picture, I spotted a pair of hands. The ring on one hand was unmistakably Maya's. I grabbed my phone and confronted my wife with a photo. You went hiking with him? Her face immediately flushed with embarrassment and panic. I was just scouting out the trail. I mean, I'm going with you in a few days, right? It was the first I'd ever heard of needing to scout a hiking trail. Didn't her friends call hiking old people's entertainment? Why were they all so enthusiastic? When my wife said she was going hiking, I asked you to go before and you refused.

She filed for divorce immediately, thinking she'd hit the Jackpot. Since we've been married for five years, Lauren strutted into that Phoenix courtroom wearing a two thousand dollar dress I'd bought her, confident as hell. Her lawyer was already calculating his commission on what they thought would be a four million dollar payout for my construction business and dad's inheritance. The whole courtroom was packed. Lauren had actually invited some of her friends to watch what she called James's comeuppance. She been telling everyone for weeks how she was about to become independently wealthy. Your honor, her attorney announced, adjusting his expensive tie. Mrs. Peterson deserves substantial compensation for supporting her husband's career growth during their five year marriage. Lauren actually winked at me from across the room. She thought I was just some heartbroken guy who'd roll over and pay whatever she demanded. Her friends in the gallery were practically grinning, waiting for the show. But here's what Lauren didn't know. Six months before I caught her cheating, I'd started noticing weird charges on our joint credit card. Expensive dinners at restaurants I'd never been to, hotel rooms booked during girls trips that didn't add up, designer lingerie purchases that never made it home. The final straw was when I found an 800 dollar charge at a jewelry store downtown. When I asked Lauren about it, she said she bought herself A birthday present. Problem was, her birthday wasn't for four months. So I hired a private investigator named Frank. Best $5,000 I ever spent. Frank followed Lauren for six weeks. What he discovered was worse than I imagined. The yoga instructor was just the latest in a long line of affairs. There was also her personal trainer, a bartender from her favorite restaurant, and even one of my own business partners. Lauren had been using our joint accounts to fund these relationships, expensive gifts, romantic getaways, even paying for her affairs, gym memberships. She'd blown through nearly $50,000 of our money over two. In our divorce hearing, my wife smirked. I'm taking.

The first few times it happened, I actually did it. I'd be running around like crazy, vacuuming, scrubbing the bathroom, throwing stuff in closets and I'd speed to the grocery store, spend like 100 bucks, come back and cook while still in my work clothes. By the time people showed up, I looked like a mess. And he'd be all relaxed like, hey, everyone, come in. Like he did something one time. He invited his parents and didn't tell me until I was already at target buying stuff for myself. I had to abandon my cart and go buy ingredients for his mom's favorite pot roast recipe that takes three hours to make. I literally got home with two hours left. I didn't even eat that night because I was so stressed. But the worst one was when he told me his college buddies were coming over in four hours. Four hours. It was a Saturday and I've been planning to deep clean my closet all day. I was in old sweats with my hair in a messy bun, no bra, looking rough. He texted me at like 2 In the afternoon. Hey, babe, Jake, Kevin and Brad are coming at 6. Can you grab some steaks and make that potato salad they liked last time? I just sat there staring at my phone. That potato salad takes forever because you have to boil the potatoes, let them cool, dice everything super small. Plus, our house was a disaster. There were dishes.

Look, my wife is perfect. Like actually perfect. She makes mid six figures as a senior engineer, insists I stay home and literally showers me with gifts every time she gets a bonus. Because she says being a stay at home husband is the hardest job in the world. We're child free by choice. And honestly, I thought I had it made. But when we got married five years ago, my mom pulled me aside at the reception. I remember exactly what she said because it felt so serious. Listen to me. Always keep escape money. Doesn't matter how good she seems. You never know what people become. She made it sound so logical, so necessary. Like not having it would be stupid. So I started hiding $750 a month in a separate account my wife didn't know about. We were comfortable. She never looked at the detailed statements. Felt harmless. Then two years ago, everything changed overnight. My wife got hurt at work in this freak accident. A loading dock collapsed. She nearly died. They said if the beam had hit six inches to the left, she wouldn't have made it. She survived, but has permanent nerve damage in her left leg. Walking hurts her every single day now. The hospital bills were insane. We're talking $180,000 after insurance. Then we tried suing the company for negligence, $40,000 on lawyers and lost that lawsuit. Destroyed what was left of our savings. We had to sell everything. Her dream car, this vintage Mustang she'd been restoring for three years. Gone. Her motorcycle that took her 20 years to save up for and buy outright. Sold for half what it was worth. Watching her sign those titles over seeing her face. I'll never forget it. A part time job at a hardware store while she recovered. Made about one $800 a month. It helped, but barely covered groceries. When she finally healed enough to work again, she insisted I quit. Said it was her role to provide, that she needed me home managing everything else because her body couldn't handle the extra stress. Now she works two full time jobs. Her main engineering position from 5:00am to two PM. Then she does remote consulting from three PM to eleven PM. On weekends, she picks up shifts doing nails at her friend's salon because she got licensed years ago. As a hobby, she makes decent money, but nothing like before. Or I kept putting money in my secret account. Dropped it from $750 to $200 a month because I knew things were tight. But I still did it. My mom's voice kept echoing in my head. You never know what people become. Last Tuesday, my wife came home at 11:30 p m. And just collapsed on the couch.

We're halfway through freshman year and my friends still grabbed my wrist to show people how their fingers overlap or joke that I could share my metabolism with them. Not kidding. Last week, my roommate Leah literally put extra fries on my plate when I wasn't looking because someone needs to feed you, babe. Finding this friend group three months into college felt like finally breathing. They adopted me instantly. Leah pulling me into their booth at the dining hall, Sophie looping her arm through mine at parties. At every party, they joke I was their pocket sized friend. Yeah, makes comments like eat a burger skinny whenever we go out. For months it was relentless but weirdly affectionate. You're gonna blow away. Real women have curves. Bones are for dogs. Every meal was commentary. How are you full already? Must be nice to eat whatever you want. from their guy friend group literally picked me up with one arm once just to prove he could. But it felt like belonging, like finally having friends who cared enough to tease me. Besides bringing up my celiac seems dramatic. I'd rather take the skinny jokes and be the friend who needs special accommodations. Then three weeks ago, something shifted. The comments stopped. No more eat a burger jokes. No more grabbing my wrists. Instead, they got weird, careful, like they were walking on eggshells. Leah started buying extra snacks for the Room, casually leaving them on my desk. Sophie stopped making the metabolism jokes, replaced with random compliments about my personality. Olivia began suggesting restaurants with lots of options. When we went out Thursday night, I'm coming back early from Bio Lab and I hear them through the door. Our whole crew is in there. Leah, Sophie, Olivia, Jade, Madison. They never hang without me. Saturday at the pre game, before everyone else shows up, Leah's saying we have to be supportive but direct. The signs were all there. Jade says she never finishes meals, goes to the bathroom right after eating. She's getting thinner. My heart stops. They think I'm bulimic. Madison adds something about nutrition labels and restrictive behaviour. Leah's voice gets soft, talking about doing this with love. They're planning an intervention for me. I text Sam from home about what I just heard. She asks what they could possibly be staging an intervention for. And when I tell her they think I'm bulimic, she points out the obvious. It's because of my celiac. But they don't know about that. She tells me to just tell them. But I have a better idea. I'm going to make a point. Saturday arrives. I've been at the library all day, giving them time to set up. At 5:45, I hit up the only gluten.

I started crying. I couldn't miss this, dad. We're both sobbing, laughing, holding each other. You're right. Let me cut this in half. Suddenly, hands grabbed my shoulders hard, yanked me backward. I stumbled, almost fell. Diane was right there. Before I could react, she won to Mike Tyson. Punched me full force, right to the jaw. The sound echoed through the entire ballroom. My entire face exploded in pain. My eyes watered instantly. Two hundred people gasped. Diane pointed at me, screaming. Who the hell do you think you are? You don't get to just show up and touch my husband! Diane! My dad's voice was ice. No, this random girl walks in, puts her hands all over you, and I'm supposed to smile? She's probably some stalker. Who? That's my daughter. My dad's voice cut through the room like a gunshot. Diane froze. Um. Your what? What? My daughter Marley, who you just assaulted in front of 200 witnesses. Her face went pale. I didn't know you. Never. I showed you pictures multiple times. I even told you she might be coming today. His voice shook with rage. You were too busy being jealous of every woman near me to pay attention. The room went dead silent. Diane reached for him. Daniel, please. I was protecting you. You hit my daughter. Each word landed like a hammer. Get out. Pack your things. I want you gone by tomorrow. Her face crumbled. We're married. We took vows. And you just broke them. Leave now. She looked around desperately. At the firefighters, at her friends. No one moved to defend her. She grabbed her purse. You'll regret this. My dad pulled me close. I've been lonely with you. At least now I'll have my daughter back. She left, heels clicking furiously. The door slammed. My dad turned to me. Are you okay? Baby? I'm so sorry. I had no idea. She. His voice broke. I hugged him hard. You chose me. That's all that matters. Dad. We spent the rest of the night at his table, just talking. Making up for four years. It's been, like, four months since that retirement part. And although getting punched in the jaw hurt like hell, getting my dad back in my life is well worth it.

She didn't just yell. She physically grabbed me, shoved me in front of 200 firefighters. My dad's reaction made the entire ballroom go silent. My dad and I hadn't spoken in four years. Not because we fought. Just life. He moved to Arizona after the divorce. I stayed in Michigan for school. Calls got shorter. Text stopped. We drifted. Then my aunt texted, your dad's retiring Friday. Big party. He'd never ask. I stared at that message for two days. Finally booked a last minute flight. Didn't tell anyone. I wanted it to be a surprise for him. The country club was packed. Firefighters, neighbors, strangers. I stayed near the back. My dad sat at the front table, laughing. He looked older, happier. Next to him sat a woman I didn't recognize. Blonde hair, diamond necklace, her hand on his arm. She looked like an Aliexpress Karen. One of those women you look at and already know their entire personality. My aunt appeared. You made it then quieter. That's Diane, his wife. They married last year. She's intense. My stomach dropped. Wife? He didn't tell me he got remarried. After mom, speeches started. Everyone talking about my dad's bravery, his loyalty. Every word reminded me we used to be close. Halfway through, I noticed Diane staring. Not casual glancing. Full on staring at me. Acting cold and tying to be alpha or something. Every time I looked up, she was still watching, whispering to the woman next to her. My aunt leaned over. Ignore her. She gets territorial. After a while, the speeches ended, and I worked up some courage and approached the front table. I walked up and tapped my dad's shoulder. He turned. His face cycled through shock, recognition, Joy, Marley, surprise. He stood so fast his chair fell. Pulled me into a crushing hug. Lifted me off the ground. You're here.

Sat on my floor for three hours, playing me songs on his guitar until I felt better. I wasn't even actually sick that night. Eleven forty seven PM. Good night, bro. Love you. Feel better. I stared at that text until 2:00am yesterday morning. My phone buzzed at 7:15. And breakfast before school. Just us. When I got to the diner, rain wasn't there. Just him, sitting in our usual booth, looking weird, nervous. He was playing with the sugar packets, stacking them, unstacking them. Can I ask you something weird? He said without looking up. I nodded, suddenly very aware of my own heartbeat. Do you ever feel like you're supposed to want something, but you just don't? My mouth went dry. I asked what he meant. He stared at his hands for what felt like 10 minutes. The waitress came by twice. We both ignored her. Finally he looked up. I broke up with rain last night. I didn't know what to say. I managed to ask if he was okay. I told her I couldn't keep pretending I was into her when I'm clearly into someone else. He was still staring at me. Someone I've been too scared to tell for the past six months because I thought he was straight and I didn't want to ruin everything. He. The word hung in the air between us. I froze. Completely locked up. Couldn't breathe. He slid his phone across The table. It was open to our text thread, but not just the messages folder. A screenshots folder. All 34 of my screenshots were there. Every single good night, bro, love you. I'd saved. I noticed you screenshotting them, he said quietly around message six. So I started screenshotting yours, too. He scrolled down. There were dozens more screenshots of random texts I'd sent him. Good morning texts, memes I'd shared, a photo I sent him of a sunset. All saved, all dated. I have 127, he said. I counted last night. My hands were shaking so bad I had to put them under the table. So he said, I'm either about to make the best, best decision of my life or completely destroy our friendship. But I really need to know if you feel the same way. I do. I couldn't form words. I just nodded. He smiled. Actually smiled this huge, relieved smile I'd never seen before. Prom's next month, he said. Wanna go with me? Like, actually with me? I'm still trying to process the fact that he's been screenshotting my texts for six months. We're going to prom together, and he just texted me good night 10 minutes early tonight. It said, good night, I love you. No, bro. This time.

Now I've got $400 in a bank account grams helped me open. He matches whatever I save. I got suspended last Wednesday for fighting. This kid kept running his mouth about my mom, kept making snorting sounds whenever I walked past. Mom would have screamed at me for an hour about how I embarrassed her, then ignored me for three days. Grams picked me up for school and didn't say anything for 10 minutes. Finally, he asked what happened. I told him. He was quiet for another minute, then said, sounds like you were defending someone you love and that's not something to be ashamed of, even if you went about it wrong. That weekend, he installed a heavy bag in the garage and taught me how to throw a proper punch, spent three hours showing me footwork. He does weird stuff that annoys me sometimes. He hugs me without asking, comes into my room without knocking, snores like a chainsaw vacuum at 2 in the morning when he can't sleep, won't let me watch anything over PG thirteen unless he screams at first. But he also keeps orange juice in the fridge because I mentioned I like it once. Makes spaghetti every Thursday because it's my favorite. Bought me a giant box of Legos after he caught me playing with my uncle's old set, the expensive kind, too, like $80. Two weeks ago, I got the flu. Nothing serious, just felt like garbage. It was my night to do dishes, but Gramps wouldn't let me. Kept bringing me water every hour, asking if I needed anything, made me go to bed at 8 and tucked me in like I was 5 years old. My mom never did that even when I actually was 5. She just tell me to take some Tylenol and stop being dramatic. Last night I couldn't sleep and went down stairs for water, found him at the kitchen table at 2:00am reading my biology textbook. He saw me and got embarrassed, said he was just trying to understand what I'm learning so he can help me study better. Started explaining cellular respiration to me even though he had half of it wrong. He was trying so hard. That's when it actually hit me. My mom had 16 years to care about me and didn't. This man had three months and gave me everything she never could. I'm never going back.

My lawyer said it was the most clear cut fraud case he'd seen in 15 years. We had a confession on my phone recording I'd started taping. Once she mentioned the wedding day, he said we'd go for an annulment based on fraud. I could get out. No alimony, no child support, nothing. I asked about the kids. He got quiet and said you might want to get a paternity test. That thought hadn't even crossed my mind. But suddenly I remembered how my daughter had my wife's nose, my wife's eyes, my wife's everything and nothing of me. My son, too. The test came back three weeks later. Neither of them were mine. Donovan was their biological father and apparently everyone knew my wife or parents, probably my own brother who took that two thousand dollar bribe. I was just the wallet, the stable income, the guy who paid for everything while they played house. My lawyer filed the paperwork. I signed away all rights. No more child support, no more college funds, no more anything. It felt like cutting off my own arm. What was I supposed to do, keep paying for someone else's family? Then four months went by. I started to feel normal again. Got my own apartment started. Going to the gym, stopped checking my phone every five minutes, hoping the kids would text. They never did. Then one random Tuesday, my phone exploded, 25 missed calls from my oldest daughter, all in the span of an hour. One voicemail, one text that said, dad, call me back right now. When I finally called, she was crying, couldn't even get full sentences out. At first, she said they kicked onan out last week after he drained Mom's bank account, took everything, $68,000 from savings, another 40 on credit cards he'd opened in her name. Turned out he had three other families in different states. Same setup every time. Find a woman with, play dad to her kids, clean her out, disappear. Cops found him in the Nevada with wife No. 4. My daughter kept crying, saying she was sorry that they didn't know he was like that, that mom was a mess and couldn't pay the mortgage and the school was threatening to kick the not for unpaid tuition. she got quiet and asked if I'd come to her birthday dinner next week. Said she really wanted me there, that she missed me, that maybe we could talk. I sat there on my couch in my quiet apartment listening to this kid who'd called another man dad for three years, begged me to show up for her 13th birthday. I told her I'd think about it and I hung up.

We love Donovan, the youngest son added. I stood there holding the pancakes I just made wondering who the hell Donovan was. My wife wouldn't look at me, just kept scrolling her phone like I'd already disappear here. This was supposed to be a normal Saturday morning. I'd woken up early to make their favorite blueberry pancakes, the ones with the little chocolate chips mixed in that I've been making every weekend for eight years. My daughter was 13, my son was 10. And they were looking at me like I was a stranger who'd wandered into their kitchen. Turned out Donovan was my wife's boyfriend from high school, been around for three years while I worked 60 hour weeks at the firm to pay for their private school tuition. That ran me 42,000 a year. My wife finally looked up from her phone and said, you're just extra. We needed your income, not you. She said it so casually like she was explaining why we bought generic cereal instead of the brand name. I asked what she meant and my son, the kid I taught to ride a bike last summer said, Donovan takes us to the park on Saturdays, a good park with the zipline, not the boring one you go to. My daughter added, yeah, and he actually knows our teachers names and comes to our school events. You're always working. I'd missed exactly two school events in Eight years, both because of emergency client meetings that I'd apologized for 100 times. My wife stood up and started clearing plates that no one had touched. Donovan's been staying here when you travel for work. The kids prefer him anyway. He actually listens when they talk. I went upstairs and started packing. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely zip my suitcase. The kids didn't even ask where I was going. They were already on the couch facetiming Donovan, showing him the new PlayStation. I bought them two weeks ago for early Christmas. Cost me $600 and I've driven to three different stores to find it in stock. That's when my wife followed me upstairs and draw a real bomb. I cheated on you the day we got married in the bathroom during cocktail hour. She said it while folding laundry like it was a fun wedding story. She forgot to mention your brother walked in on us but I $2,000 to keep quiet. She laughed, actually laughed and said he bought a motorcycle with it. I asked why she even married me then she shrugged. You had the stable job, the good insurance. My parents liked you. Donovan was broke back then living with his mom. It was just practical. Practical. I'd spent $18,000 on that wedding, another 12 on the honeymoon to Italy that she said was the best week of her life. I moved into a hotel.

When I got my first apartment, my parents asked for a spare key in case of emergencies. I gave them one, and that's when the problem started. The first sign of trouble was coming home and finding my throw pillows rearranged. Mom had stopped by to drop off some containers I didn't ask for. She said she just wanted to make sure I was settling in okay. I told her to call first next time. He laughed and said, you're my daughter. I don't need an appointment. A few weeks later, I found my sister's shampoo in my shower. Mom said Becca needed somewhere to crash when she was in town. I told her she could use your place since you were at work. No one had asked me. I told mom this wasn't acceptable. She said I was being selfish. A month after that, I noticed my mail had been opened. Dad said I was just checking if anything important came. I sat them down and asked for my key back. Mom started crying and called me paranoid and ungrateful. Dad crossed his arms and said, we're not giving the key back. We're your parents. So I changed the locks. I called a locksmith the next day and had new deadbolts installed. I didn't give my parents a copy. Problem solved. Or so I thought. Two weeks later, I came home from Work and found my mother sitting on my couch. I froze in the doorway. I said, how did you get in here? She smiled and held up a key. She said, I called the landlord and explained I was your mother and needed access in case of emergency. He was very understanding. I was shaking. I said, you went behind my back to my landlord? She rolled her eyes. She said, don't be dramatic. I'm your mother. I have a right to check on you. I called my landlord that night and told him under no circumstances was he to give anyone access to my apartment. He apologized and said my mother had been very convincing. I thought that would be the end of it. A month later, I came home to find my window screen popped out and my window open. Nothing was stolen, but my laundry had been folded and put away.

My son was diagnosed with a rare heart condition when he was 4. By the time he turned 7, he needed a specialized surgery that only one doctor in Boston could perform. The procedure cost $123,000 and our insurance denied coverage, calling it experimental. We'd already sold our house and moved into a tiny apartment. I was working two jobs while my husband took care of our son, whose condition was deteriorating rapidly. His lips would turn blue during even mild activity and he'd started having fainting spells. Last month, his cardiologist called us in for an emergency appointment. His heart was failing faster than they expected. If he doesn't get this surgery within three weeks, I don't think he couldn't finish the sentence, but we understood we were still $11,000 short. Despite the gofundme and community fundraisers, I picked up a third job at an upscale hotel bar in downtown Chicago, working overnight shifts after my day jobs. I was surviving on two to three hours of sleep, but nothing mattered except getting that money. On my fifth night, I was so exhausted I could barely stand. That's when Keanu Reeves walked in alone around 1 am he was in town filming, according to the local news. He wore simple clothes and looked tired. Sitting at the far end of the empty bar, I recognized him immediately but could see he wanted privacy. I just nodded. And asked, what can I get you? No name, no recognition. He ordered a whiskey neat and asked for the food menu. While making his drink, my hands were shaking from exhaustion. I dropped a glass and it.

Then dad has the absolute nerve to suggest we need to move to a bigger house for Emma's sake. But obviously, you two can't afford anything decent in this crazy market on your salaries. The final straw happened exactly two weeks ago. Dad calls me up all excited saying they want to set up a proper college fund for Emma. That's when I completely and utterly lost it. I said, dad, you've been holding my money hostage for 8 years, money that was specifically left to me by Grandpa. You clearly don't trust me with my own inheritance, but somehow you want me to trust you with managing my daughter's entire future. He got all defensive and huffy, started saying I should be grateful they're helping it all that most parents don't can you supporting their adult children like this. And I was being ungrateful for everything they've done. So I said, fine, you wanna play these control games? If you can't trust me with my own money that my grandfather left specifically to me, then you absolutely can't be trusted around my daughter either. I told them they could see Emma again when every single penny of my inheritance was transferred directly to my bank account. Until that happened, they were completely cut off from our lives. No visits, no phone calls, no social media posts with her pictures. Sarah Thought I was being too harsh at first, but when I sat down and explained how they've been systematically manipulating and controlling us with money that was never even theirs to begin with, she completely got it and support ordered the decision. My mom immediately started crying and wailing, saying I was being completely unreasonable and that they only wanted what was best for me and Emma. Dad tried his usual guilt trip tactics saying that grandparents have rights too and I was being cruel. But I held absolutely firm this time. I blocked them on all social media platforms, returned every single expensive baby gift to the their doorstep and told them the ball was entirely in their court. you wanna know how long it took them to magically find my inheritance once they realized I was dead serious about cutting them off from their precious granddaughter? Exactly 48 hours. Turns out when you actually threaten to take away something that genuinely matters to them, they can move pretty damn fast with those financial transfers.

So here's the thing. My parents have been holding my grandfather's money hostage for eight years. We're talking six figures here. Money he specifically left me when I was 18. My grandfather was this amazing man who basically raised me while my parents were always traveling for work. He owned a chain of hardware stores across three states. And when he died, he left me everything in his will. $150,000 plus some stocks and bonds. But my parents swooped in immediately and said I was too immature to handle that kind of money. They put it in some trust fund they control, saying I had to prove myself first and show I could be responsible with finances. I spent my entire 20s trying to prove I was responsible enough. Got my degree in accounting, worked at the same accounting firm for four years straight. Never missed a single payment on anything. I had perfect credit, savings account, even started a small investment portfolio with my own money. But every time I brought up the inheritance, dad would go on these long rants about how young people today don't understand the value of a dollar and need to learn patience. Meanwhile, they're driving around in brand new outies every two years and taking monthly trips to Europe, posting photos from fancy restaurants in Paris and Rome. Fast forward to now. I'm 28, Married to an amazing woman named Sarah, who's a tea. And we just had our first baby six months ago, a beautiful little girl named Emma, who looks exactly like my grandfather. Suddenly, my parents want to be the world's best grandparents. They're showing up unannounced with expensive strollers, designer baby clothes from boutiques, this massive hand carved wooden crib that cost more than my monthly car payment. Mom's posting pictures on Instagram, constantly hashtagging everything with said grandma and spoiling my grandbaby. And grandparents know best. But here's what's driving me absolutely insane. They're still treating us like we're broke college kids who can't take care of ourselves or make adult decisions. Last month, mom shows up at our door with bags of groceries from Whole Foods. Organic everything. She literally said, we know money's tight with the baby and Sarah's maternity leave, so we thought we'd help out with the essentials. I'm watching them casually drop $300 on organic baby food.

As it closed behind me, I heard dad say, see, can't even take a joke. That night. I made a decision. I did some digging, called a few contacts, pulled public records. My parents were broke. Not just tight on money, genuinely broke. Dad had refinanced the house two years ago for a crypto startup that tanked. They were weeks from foreclosure. I contacted the bank, made an all cash offer through a shell company, got the house for 20% below market value. I didn't evict them immediately. I waited, paid utilities, let them think they dodged a bullet. Three months later, Dad's 65th birthday, Kara invited me to a private dinner downtown, 12 seats, same number. Who handed me that book? I showed up early, Navy Blazer, New Watch. Dinner was civil at first, small talk, wine, then dessert arrived, a chocolate cake covered in candles. Then I stood, glass raised. Before everyone leaves, I wanna share something. Most of you know I've been building my company, but recently I started exploring real estate, community projects, legacy properties. I paused. One property came up for sale recently. It meant something to me, so I bought it. I looked at dad, it was yours. I didn't buy it from you bought it from the bank. You were in pre foreclosure. Your crypto guy tanked. His face drained of color. Mom grabbed his arm. I've let you stay there these past months, covered utilities, your lease. Is ending. You'll get a letter this week. You have 60 days to vacate. After that, it becomes a startup incubator. Mom gasped. You're evicting us. I'm reclaiming something that was never yours to weaponize. Dad stood, face red. You think this makes you better than us? No, I said, it makes me free. Half the table froze. Someone's glass clinked. I slid an envelope to Kara. Scholarship fund for your kids, fully paid tuition, no strings. Her eyes filled with tears. Dad stormed out. Mom followed. Half the table cleared. Kara whispered, I didn't know it was that bad. That's because I stopped telling you when it started hurting. I walked out into the night. I wasn't the dropout anymore. I was the legacy.

My aunt kept a scrapbook of every achievement. Last Thursday was Thanksgiving at my grandmother's house. I hadn't been to a family gathering in nine years. Aunt Kathy convinced me to let her handle something special. I trusted her completely. The whole family gathered, 37 people. My mother holding court about my brother's promotion to district manager. She was mid story about how she raised him with values and direction when Aunt Kathy stood up, said she had an announcement. My mother looked annoyed at being interrupted. Kathy pulled out a folder, started pulling out documents, my law degree, my bar certification, letters of recommendation from federal judges, an article about my latest case from The Washington Post. She laid them out on the dining table like playing cards while everyone went silent. Since some people seem unaware, Kathy said, looking directly at my mother, your daughter graduated from Harvard Law. She's a federal prosecutor. My mother's face went through 17 different expressions. I grabbed the diploma, checking if it was real, started stammering about misunderstandings and communication issues. My uncle asked how long I've been a lawyer. Kathy answered for me, said four years. Four years of my mother not knowing anything about my life. My grandmother asked my mother how she could not know her own daughter was at Harvard. My mother tried to say I'd hidden it from her. Kathy pulled out her phone, showed text messages of my mother saying she didn't care what I was doing, that I was dead to her, that mentioning my name was forbidden. My cousin asked why my mother had been saying I was a failure all these years. The room turned into chaos. Relatives demanding explanations. My grandmother crying about missed years. My brother admitting he'd known but was told not to say anything. My mother tried to hug me, saying we could start fresh. I stepped back, told her she was right about one thing, I was a disappointment. Kathy drove me to Thanksgiving that day. She also drove me home. But my mother found out my address from my brother, showed up the next day and said we need to discuss my monthly fund. Full story on channel link below.

What Hannah didn't realize was that tree wasn't just there looking pretty. It was blocking the afternoon sun. Our houses face west, and during summer, the sun beats down on everything from two in the afternoon until sunset. My tree had been shading both our houses for years. Her house is actually her whole side yard and half her roof were covered by my tree's shadow. Not anymore. The first week after the tree came down, temperatures hit 95 degrees. I barely noticed, but Hannah noticed. About 10 days later, she knocks on my door. She looks tired, sweaty, different. She asks if we can talk. I let her in. She sits down and looks like she might cry. My electric Bill came yesterday. She says it's true. Triple what it usually is. Triple. I asked what happened. She said her AC has been running non stop since the tree came down. Her house gets so hot in the afternoon, she can't even sit in her living room. The sun pours through her windows and heats everything up. She didn't realize how much the tree was helping until it was gone. I just sat there looking at her. She kept talking. Her garden is dying because there's no shade. Her dog won't go outside in the afternoon because the yard is too hot. She's buying shade sales and awnings, but it's costing thousands. He stops and looks at me. Could you Maybe plant another tree? She asks quietly. I'll pay for it. I'll pay for everything. Please, I need that shade back. I told her I'd think about it. She nodded and left. That was six months ago. I did think about it. Then I decided not to plant another tree. You know why? Because even if I planted one today, it would take years to grow big enough to provide shade. The tree I cut down took five years to get that big. She doesn't have five years. She stopped by last month and apologized. I told her there's nothing I can do now. She started crying and walked away. Sometimes I think about planting a new tree.

I had this bathroom pass system where students got three passes per semester and if you ran out, you were stuck holding it during class. It worked perfectly at first, but then second semester, this kid, Derek, started asking to use the bathroom every single day. I reminded him he was out of passes completely since mid January and he said he knew, said he'd just hold it. But the next day he asked again and I said no. And he just sat back down with no complaints, just went right back to his work like nothing happened. This pattern continued for six straight weeks where every single day Derek would raise his hand and ask for the bathroom. I'd say no and reference the past policy and he just accept it and go back to work without arguing or making any kind of scene. I started thinking he was just testing my boundaries, trying to wear me down until I'd eventually cave and let him. But he stayed completely polite the entire time. Then one Tuesday, the principal called me into her office with this weird expression on her face, half amused and half genuinely concerned. And she asked if I knew that Derek had been leaving my classroom every single day for the past two months. I actually laughed out loud and told her that was impossible because I never gave him a bathroom pass, not even once. She turned her monitor toward me and pulled up security pretty footage from outside my classroom door, started playing it back from February and the footage showed Derek walking out of my room with the time stamp reading 1:47 p. M. Right in the middle of my 5th period class. She fast forwarded to the next day and same thing, Derek walking out at the same exact time. And she kept going through day after day where every single day showed the same pattern of Derek leaving during 5th period, always around the same time. I sat there completely confused. There was no way I wouldn't have noticed a student just walking out in the middle of my lesson. I would have seen him get up and walk to the door and stopped him before he even reached it. The principal could see my confusion so she rewind the footage and played it in real time to let me watch second by second. The camera showed Derek sitting at his desk in the back corner and he raised his hand high and I watched myself walk over to him and shake my head no, then watched him lower his hand before I walked away and turn my back to write something on the whiteboard. The exact moment.

I logged in, searched flight confirmation. Tatar Airways, three tickets to dohaqatar departing Sunday at six PM one way. This has been planned. I called my lawyer at 7:00am Sunday, left an emergency voicemail. Then I called the police emergency line. They connected me to Detective Madalena. Meet me at the international terminal at three PM we'll intercept them Sunday at three PM I met Detective Madalena. Boarding starts at 5. We rushed through security, got to the gate at 3:30. I scanned every face. No Jackson, no Brianna, no Hazel. Where are they? Madalena, check your phone. T s a. Shows they haven't checked in. Four PM, nothing. 4:30, still nothing. What if they're not coming? Those tickets cost $4,000. They're coming. 4:45, the gate was packed. I kept watching the entrance. Five PM, then I saw them walking fast. Jackson pulling a suitcase, Brianna with a backpack, Hazel between them with her pink bag. Her face was red from crying. I ran over, tapped Jackson's shoulder. He turned, froze. What are you doing here? Stopping you from taking my daughter? Brianna stepped between us. We're taking a trip. One way to Qatar. Jackson's eyes widened. Madelaine showed her badge. Nobody's boarding this flight. Jackson grabbed Hazel's hand and pulled her toward the gate. You can't stop us. I grabbed Hazel's other hand. She was crying, Mommy, stop, it hurts. Airport security pulled Jackson back. Officer took Hazel and handed her to me. Jackson was screaming, she's my daughter. The gate agent announced boarding. People started lining up. Security search their bags. Jackson had Hazel's birth certificate, medical records and passport. Brianna had a folder, job offer from a hospital in Doha, apartment lease, school enrollment forms. Madalena showed me once in guitar. You'd never see her again. My hands went numb. I knelt with Hazel. When did you know? Last week daddy said we were going on a trip after my birthday. But I heard him tell BRI and we weren't coming back. That you'd never find us. Why didn't you tell me? He reads my iPad. I had to use the signal. Security handcuffed Jackson and Brianna. Jackson stared at Hazel. You ruined everything. Hazel buried her face in my shoulder. Passengers filed past onto the plane. The plane that almost took my daughter away forever. Jackson lost all custody rights and is facing felony charges for attempted international parental kidnapping. Hazel's in therapy working through what happened. And last week, she asked the therapist to play music during her session. Any song except Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, which I hope she never has to request again.

None of you ungrateful kids ever lifted a finger. You just showed up for Sunday dinners and acted like you owned the place. Grandma wanted us to have Sunday dinners there. She wanted it to stay in the family. Well, Grandma's dead, Frank said, and I'm the executor of her estate. The farm goes to me. What I do with it is my business. My cousins looked at their plates. Nobody argued. Did you actually read the will, I asked? Of course. I read it. I'm not an idiot. And you check the deed at the county office. Frank laughed. Why would I need to check? The farm's been mine since she died two years ago. It's in my name. You're sure about that? Positive. He took a long drink. Stop trying to cause trouble, Jake. You're embarrassing yourself. Pulled a folder from my bag, set it on the table. What's that, Frank asked. County records. I pulled them yesterday. His smile faltered. You're bluffing. Open it. He grabbed the folder, yanked out the papers. His face went from tan to gray in about five seconds. This is fake, he said. It's not. It's certified. See the county clerk stamp. Frank's hand shook. This doesn't make sense. The will said, the will said you were executor. It didn't say you inherited the property. My aunt Sarah grabbed the papers, read them. Her mouth fell open. Whose name is on it? My cousin Tim asked. Mine, I said. The table erupted. That's impossible, Frank shouted. Your grandmother would never. She did. Three months before she died, she transferred the deed, had it witnessed and notarized, filed it with the county. Why didn't anyone know? Sarah demanded. Because grandma asked me to keep it quiet. We wanted to see what Frank would do, whether he'd honor her wishes or try to cash out. This is fraud. Frank slammed his hand on the table. You manipulated her. She was senile. She wasn't senile. I have Medical records proving she was mentally competent. Her doctor signed off. Her lawyer was present at the transfer. What lawyer? Martin Chen. He's in the family attorney for 30 years. You know him. Frank pulled out his phone, started dialing. Don't bother, I said. He's expecting your call. I told him this conversation was happening today. Frank's finger hovered over the screen. Grandma knew you'd sell. I continued. She told me about the developer who'd been calling you for years. She knew you'd take it the second she was gone. So she gave it to you. Tim asked why you? Because I'm the only one who visits the farm every week, who fixes the.

My sister Natalie has always been the favorite, and I've always been an afterthought. When we were kids, she got new clothes while I wore her stained hand me downs. And when I got straight A's, my parents put her C minus report card on the fridge and stuck mine in a drawer. I stopped expecting anything from them years ago. When I got pregnant, I called my parents to tell them they were going to be grandparents for the first time. My mom said, that's nice, honey, and then spent 20 minutes telling me about the house Natalie he was buying. Throughout my pregnancy, they asked how I was feeling exactly twice, but Natalie's house became the only thing they could talk about. Every conversation was about her new countertops or her backyard or her paint colors. My mother in law threw me a baby shower, and my parents showed up 30 minutes late and left early because they were helping Natalie pick out furniture. My due date got moved up and the doctor scheduled a C section because the baby was breech. I called my parents and told them the date and time. My mom said, oh, we'll definitely be there. This is our first grandbaby. For the first time in my life, I felt like maybe they were finally going to show up for me. My mother in law was so excited she started crying when I Told her the C section date. She bought an outfit specific for meeting her first grandchild and had been texting me every day asking how I was feeling. My father in law took the whole week off work so he could help us when we brought the baby home. Two weeks before the C section, my mom called and said, so we have a little situation. Natalie scheduled her housewarming party for the same day as your C section. She sent out invitations months ago, and she really. He wants us there. I felt my entire chest tighten. I said she knew when my C section was scheduled. My mom said, I know, but this party is really important to her. She's worked so hard on this house. We'll come by the hospital after if we can. I said, if you can. She said, the party starts at 2 and you're scheduled for noon. So we'll probably still be at Natalie's, but we'll try to stop by that evening. I said, I'm having major surgery to deliver your first grandchild. My dad got on the phone and said, you're being really selfish right now. Your sister has been planning this.

I told him. I had meetings. The experimental treatment she was doing wasn't working. She was getting weaker. Yesterday she forgot my name for 10 seconds. Rafael was still waiting for an answer. I wiped my face. I don't think I can do this anymore, I whispered. It wasn't what I meant to say. I meant I couldn't do this. Watching my mom disappear while pretending everything was fine. But he heard something else. You're breaking up with me? His voice cracked. I was about to correct him and explain, I mean, what I meant. But then he said my mom was right. She said you've been distant since you visited your parents last month. Last month when we got the diagnosis. When the doctor said aggressive and limited options. When my dad collapsed in the hospital parking lot. I'm sorry. I managed with all I could say without lying or telling the truth. Rafael stood up. I deserve someone who actually wants to be here. Someone who isn't checked out. Each word was a knife, but I took it. Because he was right. I wasn't here. I was in oncology wards and support groups and medical trials. I was googling survival rates at 3 a m. And planning for a world without her. He packed his things. Five minutes to erase three years. The door he turned. Whatever is really going on with you, I hope you figure it out. I nodded, tears streaming. He thought My tears were about us, but it was about the text I just got. Honey, can you drive me to chemo tomorrow? Dad's too upset to drive straight. I heard the door slam. Two months later, Rafael ran into my dad at the grocery store. Dad looked exhausted. Buying saltines and ginger ale. The same things Rafael's mom used to buy. They stood awkwardly by the soup aisle. So how's she? Rafael asked, trying to be polite. About the breakup. Taking it day by day, dad said vaguely. His eyes lit up. The breakups been hard on her, too? Dad looked confused. Breakup? No, I meant everything else. What everything else? Dad studied him. She didn't tell you why she ended things? He only mentioned that I said I couldn't do it anymore. Rafael. She's been driving her mother to treatment every other day. Rafael's stomach dropped. Treatment for what? Dad's face went white. You really don't know? She protected you because of what happened with your father. What happened with my father has nothing to. My dad motioned him to stop talking, that he was wrong. Her mom has cancer. Rafael. Rafael ran out of the store before dad could say another word. I opened my door to find Rafael standing there with two bags of groceries. I remember what my mom needed during chemo

I can live with not being loved, but it makes our relationship feel so one sided. I overheard my wife telling her friend that she doesn't love me and never did. She married me because she was pregnant and thought that after giving birth to our baby, she might fall in love with me. But that never happened. When her friend left, I immediately asked her about it and we had an emotional discussion. She didn't deny it. She told me the same thing she told her friend and said it's true. That's how she feels. I asked her why she married me then. She said she'd rather marry a man she doesn't love but who treats her right, with respect, takes care of her and her children than a man she loves but who is a fool, incompetent or lazy. I was shocked and hurt. I asked her what she thinks about our marriage and she said it's the marriage she always wanted. To our credit, our marriage is really good. Respect is everything. So we never overstep each other's boundaries. And when we have a problem, we figure it out as a team. She never cheated, sexted or did anything like that because she respects me too much, respects our marriage and loves our children. Her words, not mine. She also said she knows it's the same on my part. I told her I'd like some Time to think about it. And she said to take as much time as I need, assuring me she isn't going anywhere and will accept and work on whatever I decide. I don't know what to do. I'm hurt and confused. So I've been living a dream marriage with a woman who doesn't love me one bit. Basically, she settled for me because I was the best option at the time. To her credit, she's been an amazing wife and mother to our kids, boy, 9 years old, girl 11 years old. I have no doubts about her. She never cheated or hurt me in any other way. She is hard working, always honest and is a good role model for our children. I've been thinking of some things I could do, maybe marriage counseling, but our marriage is one sided in the love department. I love her with all my heart and she knows that. I don't know how marriage counseling will help because it won't change your feelings towards me. I don't want a divorce. I love her. Our marriage is amazing and our children have parents who are really there for them and who, if I can humbly say, are good role models. To sum it up, my part of the marriage is completely filled with love and respect while hers is entirely based on respect alone. She earns more than me, so she isn't with me for my money. We have been married for 12 years. And have known each other for about 15. I would like to add something here that I answered in the comments. We started as friends, then became friends with benefits and over time we evolved into what we are now. I was her only FWB. She had many friends, but I was the only one with benefits. Her ex boyfriend treated her very poorly. So I think that might have affected her to some extent. Update 4 days later. I apologize if this post gets long. I will provide more context to our situation and do my best to get to the important things quickly. I went through most of the comments on my first post and wrote down some questions I wanted to ask my wife. I also figured I'd talk with her a few more times before bringing up marriage counseling only if we can't find common ground or fix things ourselves. Like I said in one of my comments, I thought about small trip over the weekend, just two of us, no children. We could relax and have a proper heart to heart discussion. So I decided to take her to my grandparents house. It's remote, surrounded by fields, forests and there's even a river close by. It's pretty much holiday house when you want to leave the city and spend some time in nature. She loves nature so I thought it's a good place. I would be lying if I told you that I wasn't anxious. And really worried about asking certain questions and the implications of those questions. I decided to ask, even though I was fully aware that it could be painful. We left our kids with my parents and departed. She pretty much knew the purpose of this trip from the beginning. So in a way, it was easier when we got there. I didn't want to have a discussion immediately.

I'm 32. My mom kicked me out at 16 because I wasn't contributing enough to the household bills. Told me if I couldn't pay rent, I could sleep under a bridge. I moved in with my best friend's family, worked three jobs through high school and college. Built a successful IT consulting firm by 28. Haven't spoken to her in 16 years. Last month, she filed a lawsuit against me. Claimed I abandoned her in her old age and owed her financial support as her only child. The notification came via certified mail. I almost laughed when I read it. Then I saw she was asking for $5,000 a month in overdue family support payments, $50,000 in damages for emotional distress. My lawyer said these cases were rare, but not unheard of. Some states have filial responsibility laws, but given my history, he was confident we'd win. The courthouse was downtown. I took the day off work, wore my best suit. Figured if I was going to face her after 16 years, I'd at least look successful. She showed up with her lawyer and an entourage. My aunt, who I barely remembered, some neighbors from the old street, even my cousin Marcus, who used to steal my lunch money. Her lawyer was young, probably fresh out of law school. Kept shuffling papers nervously. The Judge was an older woman with reading glasses on a chain. She looked tired, like she'd seen a thousand of these cases. Mom's lawyer went first. Painted this picture of a devoted single mother who sacrificed everything for her ungrateful son. Said she worked double shifts at the hospital, showed photos of me as a kid at birthday parties and Christmas mornings. Her character witnesses backed her up. Said she was always such a caring mother, always put her son first. They couldn't believe how I'd abandoned her. My aunt even cried on the stand. It broke her heart, watching her sister struggle alone while her wealthy son ignored her. I sat there listening to this alternate reality. It was impressive, really. She'd rewritten the entire story. Then it was our turn. My lawyer started simple. Asked her about the last time she contacted me before filing the lawsuit. She stammered, well, I. I didn't have his number. He changed it. Did you try reaching out through social media, email, a letter? He blocked me everywhere. He didn't want contact. So you're saying your son, who you claim to love and miss, blocked you everywhere, and you never wondered why? She looked uncomfortable. Teenagers rebel. I figured he'd come around. He's 32, ma'am. The judge leaned forward, looking interested. Now, my lawyer continued, let's talk about when he turns 16. You filed a lawsuit claiming he abandoned the family. Can you tell the court what happened that year? He. He. Decided to leave. Thought he knew better than his mother. Did you ask him to leave? I may have suggested he needed to start contributing more or find other arrangements. Their arrangements. He was 16, still in high school. Where exactly did you expect him to go? She shifted in her seat. I assumed he'd get a job, learn responsibility. Did you provide him with food, shelter, basic necessities? After asking him to leave, he chose not to stay. That's when the judge interrupted. Ma'am, I need a clear answer.

We all looked at each other confused, but about half the class got up and moved. I stayed on the right with the kids whose parents were still together. Now, everyone who has a dog, stay. Stand. Everyone else, sit down. Three kids sat down on the left side. This was getting weird, but we kept following along because what else were we supposed to do? Right side. Anyone who walks to school moved to the back of the room. Me and four other kids moved to the back. I was starting to feel uncomfortable. Why did she need to know this stuff? Back row. Anyone who stops at the corner store on Maple Street before school, stay standing. Just me and Kaylee were left standing. My heart started beating faster. Kaylee, sit down. If you go there on Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kaylee sat down. I was the only one left standing in the back corner of the room. The substitute teacher stared at me for a long moment, then smiled. Perfect. Everyone return to your normal seats. We all moved back, confused and whispering to each other. She started teaching math like nothing happened, but I couldn't focus. Why did she need to know my exact routine? At lunch, I told my friends about how creepy it was. George said maybe she was just doing some weird icebreaker activity. But Emma pointed out She never even told us her name. When we got back from lunch, this substitute was gone. Principal Hilton was there instead, looking serious. Class, I need to ask you all some questions about this morning. He had us recreate exactly where we stood during each sort. He wrote down everyone's positions and took photos with his phone. When he got to me standing alone in the back corner, his face went pale. Did she say anything to you specifically? He asked me. No, she just stared at me. Then had everyone sit down. He called my parents to pick me up immediately. In his office with my parents and two police officers, I found out the truth. Three weeks ago, a woman had robbed the corner store on Maple Street.

Elias Morrow, room 4, 12. I literally just talked to him. The nurse's face went completely pale. She looked down at her clipboard then back at me. That patient passed away three days ago. The family was already notified. My stomach dropped. That's impossible. Show me his room right now. She hesitated, then nodded and LED me to the elevator. My hands were shaking as I pulled out my phone and showed her the text thread. The messages were right there. Bring me a burger, extra pickles. This hospital is trying to starve me. Sent 23 minutes ago. We stepped off on the fourth floor and walked to room 4, 12. The nurse swiped her badge and pushed open the door. Empty, completely stripped air. No bed, no medical equipment, no personal items, nothing but four white walls and the faint smell of industrial cleaner. Where is my father? My voice came out sharper than I intended. The nurse was now visibly panicking. She grabbed her radio and called for security. Within minutes, a guard on the floor supervisor appeared. I showed them all the texts. Someone needs to explain to me how A dead man is sending me messages about hospital food. The supervisor pulled up records on her tablet. Her face went ghostly white. Oh, my God. Mr Marrow, your father was discharged three days ago against medical advice. Discharge papers were signed by Lorna Merrow, listed as his wife and primary caregiver. Lorna, my stepmother of two years. She told us he wanted to go to a private facility. We had no reason to question it. The supervisor's voice was shaking now. But these records, they say he's deceased, shouldn't be in the system. Which facility? I demanded. She pulled up the transfer paperwork. Sunset Meadows Care Home, about 30 minutes from here. I was already running for the elevator. I broke every speed limit getting there when I burst through the doors of some.

I looked up from my plate. What settlement money? Uncle Frank's smile faded instantly. From the car accident five years ago when that delivery truck ran the red light and you spent three weeks in the hospital, my sister Heather made a strange choking sound. I watched her face drain of all color, turning almost gray under the dining room lighting. I never got any settlement money, I said slowly, a cold feeling spreading through my chest. Still paying off those hospital bills and installments. Uncle Frank put down his wine glass very carefully. Brianna, the insurance company settled for $127,000. I know because I helped your mom with the paperwork when you were still recovering. You were only 17. So it went into a custodial account until you turned eighteen. I turned to my mother, waiting for her to clear up this obvious misunderstanding, but she wouldn't look at me, very interested in cutting her Turkey into impossibly tiny pieces. Mom, my voice came out barely above a whisper. My mind was racing, trying to make the pieces fit together. I turned 18 five years ago. Where did the money go? The silence stretched out forever. I could hear the kitchen faucet dripping in the other room, each drop echoing like a countdown. Gave it to Heather, mom finally whispered, her voice cracking, for her education and getting Started with her life. The words didn't make sense at first. They literally didn't compute in my brain. You gave my money to Heather. I repeated each word coming out separately and distinctly. The money from my accident, from my broken bones and my three weeks in the hospital and my six months of physical therapy. You were getting financial aid for community college, Heather said defensively, her voice shrill and desperate. You didn't need it as much as I did. I had private university tuition and living expenses. I stared at her, actually stared, seeing my sister clearly for maybe the first time in my entire life. Is that where you got your car? The question came out flat and dead. That Audi you bought junior year that you said was from your internship. She didn't answer, but her face answered for her. The apartment downtown you lived in. My voice was getting louder, stronger. The study abroad semester in Paris. The designer clothes you kept posting online. We were going to tell you, mom started weakly when I shouted. Standing up so fast, my chair backward and hit the wall. When exactly were you planning to mention that you stole $127,000 from your daughter who got hit by a truck? The math was simple and devastating. Well, I've been working 40 hours a week at target and going to community college at night, sleeping four hours and living on energy drinks and stress. Heather had been spending my Blood money on her dream life. I called you crying, I said, my voice breaking completely. I called you crying because I couldn't afford my textbooks and you told me to budget better. I was eating Dollar Menu food for dinner while making monthly payments on bills from my own accident. You were always so resilient, Heather said, tears starting to stream down her face. Now you are handling everything fine. Handling it, I repeated the word, tasting like poison in my mouth. I had to drop two classes last semester because I couldn't afford them and work enough hours to pay rent. I've been living in a basement apartment with black mold because it's all I can afford. I haven't been to a dentist in three years. Uncle Frank was doing calculations on his phone, face getting redder by the second. $127,000 plus five years of interest. At even a conservative rate, we're talking about 145,000 to $150,000 in total value you were owed. Mom was sobbing now, but I felt absolutely nothing looking at her tears. She'd had five years to feel guilty, five years to tell the truth. That money was supposed to compensate me for permanent nerve damage in my left leg, I said. My voice deadly calm now. For the nightmares I still have about that truck coming at me, for the fact that I can't run anymore without pain and you gave it away like it was nothing. She's still your sister, mom pleaded. Desperately, no, I said. Clearly, she's a thief who watched me suffer for five years while spending money that belonged to me. That's not a sister. That's a stranger who stole my future. I grabbed my coat from the hallway, my hands surprisingly steady. Now where are you going, mom? Asked her voice small and afraid. To a lawyer, I said simply looking at Uncle Frank, I'm assuming you kept all that paperwork. He nodded grimly. Every document, I'll have it ready tomorrow morning.

My name is Shavon. The H is silent. It's pronounced like Shavon. Pretty simple once you hear it once. I've had this name my whole life, so I'm used to people getting it wrong the first time. That's fine. Normal. But Missus Hilden Brand was different. First day of 10th grade English, she called roll see O Bohan, she said, really dragging out every single letter like she was reading it off a cereal box. Raise my hand. It's shiv on. Actually, the H is silent. She smiled and nodded. Oh, of course. Sorry about that. Next day, same thing. See you Bahan. She added extra emphasis on the H this time like she was trying to make sure everyone heard it. I corrected her again politely. She apologized again. 3rd day, 4th day, 5th day. Every single morning during roll call, she butchered it. And it wasn't just saying it wrong anymore. She was over pronouncing the H like she was spitting it out. The o bun. Week 2, I stopped raising my hand to correct her. I just sit there while she said it wrong and answer here in the flattest voice possible. My friend Whitney who sat next to me started keeping count in her notebook. But the end of September, Missus Hilden Brand had mispronounced my name 47 * 47. I asked to stay after class one day in October. Missus Hilden Brand I've asked you like 100 times, but my name is shivon. The h is completely silent. Could you please try to remember? She looked at me over her reading glasses and smiled this fake smile. Oh, sweetie, I know. It's just such an unusual spelling. I'll try harder next morning during roll call. C o bahn. Louder than before. Whitney was convinced she was doing it on purpose. Dude, nobody is that dumb. She's messing with you. I didn't wanna believe it, but after three months of the same thing every single day, I started thinking Whitney was right. Other teachers got it right after one correction. Even the substitute teachers figured it out. But Mrs. Hildin Brand just kept going. Here's the thing about Mrs. Hildin Brand. She had this really weird long German last name that all the kids had been making fun of since forever. In middle school, everyone called her Missus Icky Booger because if you say Hildebrand really fast and sloppy, that's kind of what it sounds like. I'd heard my older brother and his friends call her that years ago. Apparently she taught at the middle school before moving to the high school. December rolls around. It's been four months of this every single day. The entire class knows she's doing it wrong at this point because I've corrected her in front of everyone at least 20 times. Some kids even started saying my name right just to prove they could figure it out. But not her Monday morning first period. She's taking attendance gets to my name, d O. B. A. N. Smith. She really went hard on the H that day like she was hacking up a hairball. Something in my brain just snapped. I was so tired of it. I raised my hand and said.

I was halfway through a raid in my game when Eli wandered into my room, one hand pressed flat against his chest. He was 8 years old and always interrupting me for stupid reasons, so I didn't even pause. Nana, feel this. He grabbed my hand and put it on his chest before I could stop him. His heart was hammering so fast I couldn't count the beats. It felt like a hummingbird trapped inside his ribs. Dude, what were you doing running laps around the house? He shook his head. I was just watching TV. I pulled my hand back and shrugged. You probably just got excited about something. Go drink some water. He stood there for another second looking at me with those big brown eyes, then shuffled back downstairs. I went back to my game. Mom was working a double at the hospital and wouldn't be home until morning. Dad was on a business trip in Seattle. I was 16 and in charge, which mostly meant making sure Eli ate dinner and went to bed on time. Twenty minutes later, he was back. It's still doing it, he said. This time his voice was smaller. I sighed and paused my game for real. Still doing what? The fast thing? It won't slow down. I tried taking deep breaths. Like you said that one time. I hadn't said anything about deep breaths, but I got up anyway. I put my hand on his chest again. Still racing. Feel that fluttering hummingbird feeling. I looked at him more closely. His face was flushed, but his lips looked kind of pale. Does it hurt? He shook his head, then stopped. Kinda like it's squeezing weird. I pulled out my phone and Googled fast heartbeat in kids. The results said anxiety, dehydration, too much sugar, caffeine, normal stuff. I asked Eli if he had any soda. He said no. Any candy? No. Was he nervous about something? He just stared at me. I'm nervous now because my heart won't stop. Fair point. Got him a glass of water and made him sit on the couch. I figured it would pass in a few minutes. Hearts don't just race forever for no reason. Fifteen minutes later, his heart was still pounding. I could see his shirt moving with each beat. That wasn't normal, right? I counted silently, watching the fabric jump. I got to 60 beats and maybe 20 seconds. That math didn't seem right, but I wasn't exactly a doctor. I texted Mom, Eli's heart is beating really fast. Normal. Three dots appeared, then disappear. She was probably with a patient. I looked at my brother. He was sitting very still on the couch. His hand pressed to his chest like he could hold his heart in place. Jenna, I feel weird. Weird how like floaty, like when you stand up too fast. But I'm sitting down. I grabbed my Phone again and searched, fast heartbeat, dizzy child. The first result mentioned something called s V t, super ventricular tachycardia, heart rate over 150 beats per minute. I scrolled faster. It said to call a doctor if symptoms persisted more than a few minutes. We were past that, way past that. My phone buzzed, mom, how fast is he? Pale, dizzy. I typed back, yes to both. It's been like 45 minutes. Her response was immediate. Call 9, 1 1 now. Don't wait. I'm coming. My.

I knew someone was forcing him to lie. Liam hasn't spoken since he was 9 years old. The day our house caught fire and he watched our dog burn alive, his voice just stopped. Doctors called it selective mutism from trauma. We created our own language over the years. Hand squeezes, head tilts. And one rule that was sacred between us, three taps on anything meant he was lying because someone was making him. We were kids obsessed with spy movies, but we blood oath promised three taps equals danger. In 18 years, he'd never used it once until my engagement dinner when his girlfriend of six months sat beside him and I watched his foot tap three times under the table. Veronica seemed perfect. He'd Learned sign language specifically for Liam, volunteered at disability advocacy centers, and my parents called her an angel sent from heaven. At dinner, my mom asked Liam if he was happy with Veronica. He started signing and Veronica translated with her sweet voice while her hand rested on his knee. He says, I'm the best thing that ever happened to him. That's when his right foot tapped once against the table leg. Twice. Three times. My throat went dry. I stared at him and he wouldn't meet my eyes. Hands kept signing. But something was wrong with the way Veronica smiled while she spoke for him. My fiance asked Liam if he'd Be my best man. And Liam's hands moved in response. Veronica laughed, that musical laugh everyone loved. He says he'd be honored and he's so proud of you. Tap, tap, tap. His foot hit the table leg again and I felt my heart slam against my ribs. I interrupted. Voice sharp. Liam, sign it directly to me. Veronica's smile tightened at the edges. I just translated for him, sweetie. I ignored her completely, keeping my eyes locked on my brother. Sign it again just to me. Liam's hands lifted slowly and he signed something completely different from what Veronica had said. My mom leaned forward, confused. What's going on? Veronica stood up fast, her chair scraping loud. Your sister doesn't trust me. She never has. My dad's face hardened as he looked at me with disappointment. Veronica has been nothing but good to this family. Liam's hands were shaking now signing something desperate and fast. Veronica grabbed his hands, stopping him mid sentence. You're getting overwhelmed. Let's take a break. She started pulling him toward the door and that's when I saw it. The way Liam's whole body went rigid when she touched him, the way he looked at her like he was looking at a predator. I stepped in front of the door, blocking their exit. Find what you really want to say, Liam. Without her translating, my mom stood up, voice rising. Stop attacking her. She's been taking care of him. Veronica's voice stayed calm, almost too calm. Liam has anxiety. You're making it worse. I looked at my brother, really looked at him for the first time in months. He'd lost weight, had dark circles under his eyes, wore long sleeves in August. Show me your arms, Liam. Veronica moved between us instantly. He doesn't have to prove anything to you. My dad grabbed my shoulder, trying to pull me aside. You're ruining dinner. I planted my feet, refusing to move. Liam, do you want to leave with Veronica? Sign it yourself. Not through her. Liam lifted his hands and froze completely. He looked at Veronica like he was asking permission to continue. And that one look.

Someone was listening. We came up with it after watching a news story about a woman who was saved by calling the police. Running the same, but we never thought we'd actually use it, but figured it's never bad to be over prepared. Friday night, 2:00am, my phone rang. Lily? Hi. Yeah, is this Pizza Hut? My stomach dropped. Lily? Yes, I'd like to place an order for delivery, please. Her voice was shaking. Too cheerful. Wrong. Where are you? Um, I'd like a large pepperoni pizza, extra cheese. I could hear breathing in the background. A man's, not hers. Lily, who's there with you? And can you deliver to 4 32 Fifth Street, apartment 3B? She was giving me an address. Are you alone right now? No. Actually, can you make that two large pizzas? I have a friend over. A male voice in the background who are you calling? Just ordering food, baby. Don't worry. Lily set away from the phone, then back to me. Yeah, so two large pizzas. How long for delivery? I'm calling the police right now. 30 minutes. Perfect. Can I pay with cash? Her voice cracked. Actually, can You add breadsticks. The cheesy ones. We'd never eaten breadsticks. She was stalling, trying to give me time. What's the apartment number again? 3B. 4 32 Fifth Street, apartment 3B. Please make sure the driver has the right address. She was emphasizing it. Making sure I heard. Got it. I'm calling 911 right now. Great! Thank you so much. Bye. She hung up fast. I immediately dialed 911. My friend just called me pretending I was Pizza Hut. She's in danger. She gave me an address. 4 32 fifth Street, apartment 3B. She couldn't talk freely. The dispatcher kept me on the line. Officers are eight minutes away. I pulled up Lily's Instagram. Last post from eleven PM at a club downtown with friends. Comments asking if she got home safe. No response. I checked find my friends location showed 4 32 Fifth Street, not her apartment. My phone buzzed. Text from Lily hey sorry wrong number earlier lol. Meant to call actual Pizza Hut. All good. Then another super tired going to bed. Talk tomorrow. She's texting me that it was a mistake. I told the dispatcher, but it wasn't. She's being forced. Officers are 4 minutes out.

I have pin straight hair, always have. But in college, every girl I dated mentioned loving guys with curly hair. After getting rejected one too many times, I started getting perms at this little salon near campus. When I met Rachel three years ago, she immediately ran her fingers through my artificial curls and said curly hair was her biggest weakness. I've been sneaking to a salon two towns over every six months since then, telling Rachel I'm visiting my college buddy Mike. I even Learned to use special curl enhancing products and sleep with a silk pillowcase to maintain the look. The whole routine cost me $400 every visit, but it seemed worth it to keep Rachel happy. Now our daughter Mia, is three weeks old with the most gorgeous, gorgeous, tight curls I've ever seen. Rachel keeps taking photos, posting them online with captions like, daddy's curls are strong genes and Lucky Girl got the best features from both parents. She even bought matching father daughter headbands for our curly hair club. Here's where it gets complicated. Rachel has pin straight hair, too, and last week she started getting curious about the genetics. She's been researching our family histories, calling both our moms to ask about curly haired relatives. When she couldn't find any on either side going back three generations, she started making Jokes about some mystery ancestor blessing Mia with beautiful curls. Situation got worse when we visited my parents last weekend. My mom pulled out old photo albums and Rachel found my high school graduation picture with completely straight hair slicked back back with gel. When she asked about it, I panicked and said I used to chemically straighten my hair as a teenager because I was self conscious about my curls. But Rachel's not buying my explanation. She keeps studying baby photos of both of us, muttering about scientifically impossible genetics. Even called her sister Amy, who's a pediatric nurse, to ask detailed questions about how hair texture gets passed down through families. Amy apparently told her that two straight haired parents having a curly haired child is extremely rare without some recessive gene somewhere. The pressure is building because my last perm is growing out badly, my roots are showing completely straight hair, and the curls are getting looser every day. Rachel noticed yesterday morning and asked why my hair looks so different lately and whether I've been using new products. I told her it's just stress from being a new dad, but she keeps touching it and frowning. Things escalated last night when Rachel suggested getting one of those Ancestry DNA kits for Mia just for fun to see what other genetic surprises might be hiding in our family background. She's convinced there must be some unknown curly haired relatives that would explain everything. I've been dodging the DNA conversation, but she already ordered the kit online. It arrives Thursday. Meanwhile, my next perm appointment is scheduled for next week, but Rachel wants to come with me to finally meet my college buddy Mike, who I supposedly visit so often. I obviously can't bring her to a hair salon, so I've been making excuses about Mike being busy with work. The worst part happened this morning. Rachel was changing Mia's diaper when she noticed something that made her freeze. She called me over and pointed to it.

Usually he'll wait a minute or so and then take it off when he goes to take a leak. I typically shower after he does that, but I went ahead and got up because I could feel something oozing out more than usual. I asked him if he had a slip up or if it broke, and he said no. He then got dressed and said he would see me tomorrow because something came up, gave me a kiss, and left. All of which is incredibly weird because we always cuddle. So after he left, I checked, and it was definitely his. You know what? I started panicking and blowing his phone up, but it's going straight to voicemail. So I call from a blocked number, and it's still going straight to voicemail, and my messages aren't delivering, which means he put his phone on airplane mode. He's never acted like this before. It was really strange behavior, and something didn't feel right. So I shower and go to Walgreens to get two Plan b's. And just as I was about to pull out, head to his apartment to see why he's acting like this, I get a phone call. I didn't recognize the number, so I ignored it, but it called three more times. I thought maybe it was an emergency, so I answered, and on the other end, a woman's Voice says, hey, my name is Reina. I found your number thousands of times on my boyfriend's phone Bill, and I wanted to know how you know him.

Now that the truth is out, she wants me back. What do I do? Almost two years ago, my ex went on a girls trip with her sisters and mom, leaving me at home with our son 8 and daughter 6. The night before she was due home, she sent me a message saying she knew what I had done and she wanted me gone. By the time she arrived home, that's all she said. She didn't reply to my messages and let my calls to the voicemail. When she arrived home, I was still there because I had no clue what was going on. She came in ready to go, yelling at me, accusing me of having other women in the house, telling me her friend had told her all about my affair with her and atheist one other woman. Our fight went on for days. In the end, I told her if she believed that, if she thought I was capable of doing that to her and our family, then she could pack her stuff and leave. She did and then she filed for divorce. Days later, the cops showed up at my door and took my kids. I didn't see them again for 5 months. She made it as difficult as she could for me to see my kids. She made up stories of physical and financial abuse just to keep Them from me. I fought hard. My lawyer fought just as hard as I did. And eventually I got weekend visitation. The first time seeing my kids after all those months apart destroyed me. Their misery was written all over the both of them. They saw me and threw themselves at me. They clung to me, crying so hard. I didn't care about my marriage at that point. I just cared about my kids. They were full of stories. They couldn't wait to tell me. There were so many stories that first visit and every visit after that, I started to record them. I went back to my lawyer. He said the best way to use this information was to hire a private investigator to get us proof and that way we could leave the kids out of it. So that's what I did. My pie found all the proof of what my kids told me and more. I moved forward with plans to go for at least 50, 50 custody. I got it. You can now check if there is a part 2 by pressing share and more.

When I was 16, I decided to babysit for my mom's friend while they went out and party. So I went to their house and looked over the 20 seventh graders. They were both boys. And I just told them just to not do anything crazy so I didn't have to tell their mom anything while she, they told me to enjoy the house and do whatever I wanted to do. I went in her bedroom and started to try on her clothes because I was bored. I ended up putting on a whole outfit with this cool green dress and some pantyhose and some nice heels. Then chill out on the living room couch. So I go watch some YouTube videos and they came out of their room and said they were hungry. So I ordered some pizza. The pizza got here and they had a rule not to eat in their room. So they ate in the living room with me. Me and them weren't strangers so it wasn't awkward. I was watching a show and in the show someone gets kidnapped. So while we're eating food and on our phones, there's just a girl duct taped up on the TV. One of them spoke up and said that looks easy to get out of. And to be fair, it wasn't that much duct tape. The other one said, I think you underestimate the power of duct tape. I chimed In and said y'all got any duct tape we can test this theory. They said that they knew where multiple rolls are and after pizza we all decided to do some duct tape escape so we put the food away and get the duct tape and I tape them both up only at their wrists and ankles. I didn't do a lot and I was hoping that one of them would be like make it harder than I fully to him up. Well they both eventually got out and they wanted to do a level 2 so I taped their wrists and ankles then their knees and then I taped their already taped wrists to their body then tape their elbows to their body then I put tape over both of their mouths so I told them that if they were both were able to get out of this I'll let them tape me up their time limit was until my movie was done so about an hour and a half give or take well they usually people give up but they both were going 100% the entire time well they started making progress and before the movie was done they were both out of the tape. I was shocked but I kept my word and allowed them to take me up they were excited and I was too in a sense I asked them before we started if they were going to gag me and they said yes so I said, why don't I gag myself so I know I won't die? They said this was fine, and I went and did that. I decided to take my pair of panties I was wearing off and put on their mom's soap ones, then put back on the pantyhose.

My brother Jonathan is 20 now and he's been in jail for the past two years, but he's coming home in two weeks. And watching my stepdad and stepbrother panic has been the most satisfying thing ever. Let me explain. Our dad died when I was 7 and Jonathan was ten. Before dad died, he always told Jonathan to look after me no matter what. My brother took that seriously, like really seriously. He became super protective of me after that. Three years after dad died, mom started dating Sam. Sam came with his son James, who was the same age as Jonathan. From day 1, Jonathan and Sam didn't get along. My brother has this thing where he doesn't just respect people automatically. You have to earn it with him. Sam tried acting like he was Jonathan's dad, giving him orders and setting rules. Every single time, Jonathan just ignored him. It drove Sam crazy. James thought he could copy his dad and try to buy Jonathan around, too. That was a mistake. The worst part was James making fun of our dad. I was in my room one day when I heard James telling his friends that my dad probably died because he was weak. He was laughing about it. I started crying and Jonathan heard me from downstairs. I've never seen my brother move that fast. He went straight to James's Room and I heard this loud thud. When I came out, James was on the floor, completely knocked out. Jonathan had punched him so hard that James didn't wake up for like five minutes after that. Everyone walked on eggshells around Jonathan. If anyone even looked at me wrong, all Jonathan had to do was stare at them and they'd back off immediately. James was terrified of him. Sam was, too, but he acted tough around mom. Then two years ago, Jonathan got arrested with his friend for something completely unrelated. I can't say what, but it wasn't about James or anything violent at home. He got sentenced to jail time and suddenly everything changed. The second Jonathan left. James started bullying me bad. He'd call me names, knock my stuff over, lock me out of the bathroom. I told mom, but she just said boys will be boys and to toughen up. Sam acted like he didn't see anything. I tried writing letters to Jonathan because I missed him so much and needed to tell him what was happening.

After everybody left, my sister sat next to me on the couch and asked me if I liked it and wanted to try it again. I was so nervous but definitely wanted to. We kissed and kissed and of course, I got the biggest heart on I ever had. She let her hands wander up my shirt and then down to my junk. I thought I would bust right then and there. She asked me if I wanted her to play with it. Of course, I said yes. She was older and had been with a guy before, so she kind of knew what she was doing. She pulled my shorts down and as soon as she put her hands on me, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I was literally busting all over the place in a matter of seconds. She was laughing and laughing. There was a huge mess all over me, my clothes in the couch. She got some tissues and cleaned everything up. I think she used the whole box. I went to bed and slept like a baby for 10 hours. When I started to wake up, I thought I was having a wet dream. I was wrong. She was in there playing with me again. I don't think I lasted 30 seconds. It was a little longer than the first time, but not much. There was juice all over me, in the sheets. She was laughing again, but I didn't care. All I knew was how good it felt. She knew we had the house to ourselves. So she said, let me know when you want to do it again. Just the thought of her saying that made me want it. I don't think an hour went by when she asked me if I was ready. And of course I was. I think I lasted a couple of minutes the third time. When she called me into her room a little later for what I was eagerly expecting to be the fourth time, she was lying on her bed and nothing but a bra. She said, it's my turn to help her. I couldn't wait to get in there. She taught me how to do it and she was soon flooding the Bed, I think we did.

What did your daughter's boyfriend do that forever changed how you saw him as a cop? I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. Pete just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he'd just say, what's next, Sir, one Saturday, I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me. I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Because she's worth it. I was about to respond when we heard screaming from inside the house. We both ran in to find my wife on the kitchen floor. She'd

So my hair is awful, like genuinely awful. It's super thin and curly and every morning I wake up looking like I stuck my finger in an outlet. Giant knots everywhere, hair sticking straight up, frizz for days. My best friend Tori is black and she's seen my morning hair plenty of times. She thinks it's hilarious. Last summer I was complaining about it again and she just shook her head at me. For my birthday two months ago, she gave me a bonnet, the same kind she wears every night. I honestly didn't think it would work for my hair, but I tried it anyway. Dude, game changer. I wake up and my hair is actually manageable now. Way less frizz, barely any knots. I've been wearing it every single night since my dad showed up at my apartment last weekend with his new girlfriend. I say new because my dad has a different girlfriend every few months. This one's name is Brenda and I'd literally never met her before. She walked in with her overnight bag like she owned the place. My dad gave me a hug and introduced us. Brenda barely looked at me. Cool start that night, I got ready for bed around 11. I brushed my teeth and put on my bonnet like I always do. I walked back into the living Room to grab my phone charger. And Brenda just froze. She stared at me like I'd walked out in a full clown costume. Then she goes, what is that on your head? I touched my bonnet. Oh, it's just a bonnet. I wear it to sleep so my hair doesn't go crazy. Her face.

My marriage ended because my grown husband decided toilet paper was beneath him. Like, literally beneath him, which was the whole problem. It started on a Tuesday. We were getting ready for bed and I noticed this smell. Not like normal bathroom smell, something worse. I asked him if he showered, and he said, yeah, but the smell stayed for two days. I thought maybe our cat was sick or something died in the walls. Then I was doing laundry and picked up his boxers. They were completely destroyed. Like, I'm talking streaks that would make a skid Mark look like a faint pencil line. I almost threw up right there, holding them with two fingers over the washer. I confronted him immediately, asked him straight up what was going on. And this man, this 32 year old man I married, look to me dead in the eye and said, Alphas don't wipe. I laughed. I thought he was joking. He wasn't joking. He said he'd been watching these videos online about alpha males and how modern men have been feminized by society. Apparently, wiping your butt after using the bathroom is something betas do. Real men just pull up their pants and go about their day because they're too powerful to care about basic hygiene. I told him that was the dumbest thing I'd ever heard. He got defensive and said I wouldn't understand because I'm a woman. Then he Spent 20 minutes trying to explain alpha male theory to me while I stood there holding his ruined underwear. The next day, he went to the grocery store with me. We ran into his coworker Devon in the produce section. Normal guy, has a wife and two kids. My husband walks right up to him, interrupts him picking out apples, and says, hey, man, do you wipe? Devon just stared at him. My husband goes, Alphas don't wipe, just so you know. Devon grabbed his apples and left without saying anything. This kept happening everywhere. The gas station, his mom's house for dinner. He told the guy at the tire shop he was on a mission to spread this information like it was some kind of public service. I stopped doing his laundry, told him if he wanted to live like that, he could handle his own destroyed clothes. He said that was fine and just kept wearing the same pairs over and over. Our bedroom started smelling like a porta potty at a summer festival. I tried reasoning with him. Showed him articles about infections and health risks. He said those were written by beta doctors trying to keep men weak. I suggested therapy. He said, therapists are part of the problem. His friends stopped coming over. My sister refused to visit. Our couch got a permanent stain because he'd sit there for hours watching more

I canceled the trip and did something else instead. I'm Ayesha, 39, a financial consultant. That night I was packing for a business trip when my son Amari lay next to me. Mama, he whispered, daddy has a girlfriend. I froze. What he talked to her on the phone. When you leave, they're going to go to the bank and take all the money they have. Three days she said. Soon they'd finally breathe easy. I didn't sleep that night. At 3:00am I searched documents Malik had me sign after surgery. He said they were insurance updates. It was a general power of attorney, broad authority, full access. My stomach dropped. I'd signed while recovering on morphine. He brought tea was loving, just a formality. I called my attorney friend Zora. She read them. This is serious. Full access to your assets. If he claims you're mentally unfit, he can sell your house without you. While I'm traveling. Yes, perfect window. I have to revoke this. Cancel your trip. That night, Malik asked, what time are you leaving? 6, 10:00am Thursday or Friday. Return Friday. I said perfect. That smile confirmed everything. The next morning there was an envelope in the mailbox, notarial deed dated weeks earlier. Two names, Malik and Silah. I searched her name, consulting firm, specialist in Asset Management. Then our old photos call college Folder. There she was, Sila, younger, next to Malik at a party, hugging, kissing, dated 2003. His ex girlfriend, the woman he told me he'd gotten over before we even met. She'd been waiting all along. That afternoon, Amari came home. Ma, daddy said, when you go, he's taking me to live with him and Silah. We're getting a puppy. He said, you'll be working far away. My blood froze. I hugged him. Nobody is separating you from me. They wanted to erase me completely. I left my phone recording. That night at eleven PM, Malik called someone on speaker phone. Hey, beautiful, is she asleep? Sila asked. Yeah, she doesn't suspect anything. In 48 hours, it'll all be ours. The attorney will accept the transfer. Sure. She signed during surgery. She didn't even notice. And the house already done. My brother in law received the down payment. I saved every second. Next day, I met attorney Dennis. He listened to the recording. We have proof. We can stop everything. I signed the revocation, changed my accounts, transferred everything to secure accounts. He has no control now, Dennis said. But when he finds out, he won't react. Well, Tuesday at 4:00am, I pretended to leave for the airport, drove away with my suitcase. Four blocks later, I parked in a garage Dennis arranged. Inside was a monitoring center with bank cameras. At 9:00am, Malik entered the bank. Silo waited outside as legal agent for Miss Aisha Bellweather. I want to Liquidate. The executive checked her computer, called her supervisor. The manager appeared. The power of attorney was revoked 24 hours ago. Your access is removed. You're not.

It was a Tuesday afternoon, and Jenna, our daughter's babysitter, was standing in our living room waiting to get paid. She'd watched our three year old Mia for the whole day while I was at work, and my husband Cole was supposedly handling some job interviews. Jenna had her backpack on and kept checking her phone. She needed to catch a bus. Cole was sitting on the couch, going through his wallet for the third time. He pulled out a 20 and held it up. This is all I got right now. I can Venmo you the rest tomorrow, he said. Jenna looked uncomfortable. Mister Hayes, we agreed on 60 for today. I really need the full amount now. I said, I'll get it to you tomorrow. What's the problem? I walked over from the kitchen. Cole, just pay her the 60. I have cash in my purse. He shot me a look. Stay out of it. I'm handling this. You're not handling it. She watched Mia all day and needs to get paid now. I said. I said, stay out of it! Cole snapped louder this time. Jenna was standing there looking at the floor. I could tell she just wanted to leave, but also didn't want to lose 40 bucks. Just give her the money, Cole. This is ridiculous, I said. He stood up from the couch. Shut up! I'm the one Who pays her every week? So shut up and stay out of it. Something in me just broke. I was so tired of him talking to me like that in front of other people, in front of our kids. Babysitter who is barely 19 years old. Make me shut up. Then I said. I don't even know why I said it. It just came out. He walked right up to me and slapped me across the mouth with his open hand. Hard. My ears started ringing. The whole left side of my face went completely numb, and I tasted blood on my lip. I just stood there frozen. Then I grabbed the 20 off the couch and basically ran out the front door without saying anything. I touched my mouth, and my fingers came back with blood on them. My lip was split on the inside. Cole walked back to the couch and sat down like nothing happened. He picked up his phone and started scrolling. I went to the bathroom and locked the door. I looked in the mirror, and my lip was already swelling up. There was a red Mark across my whole cheek. I sat on the edge of the bathtub and just cried. I couldn't even make sound come out. It was like silent crying where you can't breathe right. I stayed in there for maybe 20 minutes. When I came out, Cole was in the kitchen making himself a sandwich. Babe, come on. I'm sorry. You were pushing me. And, you know, money's been tight. I've been stressed about the job stuff. He said without looking at me. I didn't say anything. I walked right past him and went to our bedroom. He followed me. Don't be like this. You know I didn't mean it. You dared me to do it. I still didn't say anything. I grabbed my pillow and a blanket and went to sleep on the couch. He came out there an hour later. So you're really not gonna talk to me? I said I was sorry. You pushed me when you know I'm struggling right now. I turned my face away from him. The next morning, I still didn't talk to him. I got Mia ready for daycare and dropped

They brought me breakfast and sat with me while I filled out paperwork. My mother in law held my hand and told me how proud she was of me. They we're in the waiting area. When they took me back for surgery, everything went wrong. My blood pressure dropped and the baby's heart rate was all over the place. I could hear the doctors talking in Urgent Voices and see the nurses moving fast. They got the baby out, but she wasn't crying. For 10 seconds. That felt like 10 hours. There was just silence. Then she screamed and I started sobbing. They brought her over and put her on my chest, and she was perfect. In recovery, my in laws were waiting with flowers and balloons. My mother in law was crying and my father in law kept saying, she's beautiful. She looks just like you. They stayed with me for hours, taking turns holding the baby and bringing me water and telling me what an amazing mother I was going to be. Around 6 that evening, my parents walked into the hospital room. They were loud and laughing and I could smell wine on them. From across the room, my mom saw the baby in my mother in law's arms and her whole face changed. She rushed over and said, oh my god, let me hold her. She took the baby and stared at her and started crying. She said, she's perfect. Look at her little hands. I can't believe I'm a grandmother. My dad came over and looked at the baby and his eyes got wet. He said, she's beautiful. She looks like you did when you were born. My mom turned to me and said, why didn't you tell us it was happening now? We would have been here. I stared at her. I said, I told you two weeks ago. You chose Natalie's party. My dad said, we didn't realize the baby would be here already. We thought we had time. My father in law stood up and said, you need to leave. My mom clutched the baby tighter and said, we just got here. We want to spend time with our granddaughter. I said, give her back to her grandmother and pointed at my mother in law. My mom's face crumpled and she handed the baby over. I said, you chose a housewarming party over your daughter's life threatening surgery and the birth of your first grandchild. You showed up six hours late, drunk, and you want me to believe you care now? My dad said, please, we made a mistake. We want to be in her life. I said, get Out. My mom tried to take a photo of the baby before leaving and my father in law deleted it from her phone. They haven't seen her since.

My sister Natalie has always been the favourite and I've always been an afterthought. When we were kids, she got new clothes while I wore her stained hand me downs. And when I got straight A's, my parents put her C minus report card on the fridge and stuck mine in a drawer. I stopped expecting anything from them years ago. When I got pregnant, I called my parents to tell them they were going to be grandparents for the first time. My mom said, that's nice, honey, and then spent 20 minutes telling me about the house Natalie he was buying. Throughout my pregnancy, they asked how I was feeling exactly twice, but Natalie's house became the only thing they could talk about. Every conversation was about her new countertops or her backyard or her paint colors. My mother in law threw me a baby shower and my parents showed up 30 minutes late and left early because they were helping Natalie pick out furniture. My due date got moved up and the doctor scheduled a C section because the baby was breech. I called my parents and told them the date and time. My mom said, oh, we'll definitely be there. This is our first grandbaby. For the first time in my life, I felt like maybe they were finally going to show up for me. My mother in law was so excited she started crying when I Told her the C section date. She bought an outfit specific for meeting her first grandchild and had been texting me every day asking how I was feeling. My father in law took the whole week off work so he could help us when we brought the baby home. Two weeks before the C section, my mom called and said, so we have a little situation. Natalie scheduled her housewarming party for the same day as your C section. She sent out invitations months ago and she really. He wants us there. I felt my entire chest tightened. I said she knew when my C section was scheduled. My mom said, I know, but this party is really important to her. She's worked so hard on this house. We'll come by the hospital after if we can. I said, if you can. She said, the party starts at 2 and you're scheduled for noon. So we'll probably still be at Natalie's, but we'll try to stop by that evening.

She looked around desperately. At the firefighters, at her friends. No one moved to defend her. She grabbed her purse. You'll regret this. My dad pulled me close. I've been lonely with you. At least now I'll have my daughter back. She left, heels clicking furiously. The door. Door slammed. My dad turned to me. Are you okay? Baby? I'm so sorry. I had no idea she. His voice broke. I hugged him hard. You chose me. That's all that matters. Dad. We spent the rest of the night at his table, just talking. Making up for four years. It's been, like, four months since that retirement part. And although getting punched in the jaw hurt like hell, getting my dad back in my life is well worth it.

Firefighters, neighbors, strangers. I stayed near the back. My dad sat at the front table, laughing. He looked older, happier. Next to him sat a woman I didn't recognize. Blonde hair, diamond necklace, her hand on his arm. She looked like an Aliexpress Karen. One of those women you look at and already know their entire personality. My aunt appeared. You made it then quieter. That's Diane, his wife. They married last year. She's intense. My stomach dropped. Wife? He didn't tell me he got remarried. After mom, speeches started. Everyone talking about my dad's bravery, his loyalty. Every word reminded me we used to be close. Halfway through, I noticed Diane staring. Not casual glancing. Full on staring at me. Acting cold and tying to be alpha or something. Every time I looked up, she was still watching, whispering to the woman next to her. My aunt leaned over. Ignore her. She gets territorial. After a while, the speeches ended and I worked up some courage and approached the front table. I walked up and tapped my dad's shoulder. He turned his face cycled through shock, recognition, Joy, Marley, surprise. He stood so fast his chair fell. Pulled me into a crushing hug. Lifted me off the ground.

I screenshot it, smiled and said, you're right. Then I airdropped it to everyone at the table. Thanksgiving at my parents house, 20 people crammed around the dining table. My sister Lisa and her husband Brett sitting right across from me. Everything seems normal until my phone buzzed. A text from Brett. You look incredible today. That dress is doing things to me. I looked up, he was staring at me, smiling. Lisa was talking to our mom, completely oblivious. Another text, we should grab drink sometime, just us. Then another, your sister doesn't have to know what happens between us, days between us. I felt sick. This man had been married to my sister for three years. I took screenshots of everything. Then I noticed everyone at the table had iPhones. I opened airdrop, selected everyone, sent all three screenshots. Phone started buzzing around the table. My mom checked hers first. Her face went from confused to horrified. My dad's jaw clenched. My brother stood up. What the hell, Brett? Brett's face went completely white. What? What's happening? Lisa grabbed my mom's phone, read the messages, looked at Brett, then at me. Is this real? Check the number, I said quietly. It's his. She pulled out her phone, compared the number. Her hands started shaking. I texted my sister at Thanksgiving dinner while sitting next to me. Brett stammered. I was joking. It was just a joke. Which part was the joke, my dad asked, standing up. The part where you hit on her daughter or the part where you said your wife doesn't need to know? I didn't mean I was drunk. You've had one beer, my mom said coldly.

I screenshotted it, smiled, and said, you're right. Then I airdropped it to everyone at the table. Thanksgiving at my parents house. 20 people crammed around the dining table. My sister Lisa and her husband Brett sitting right across from me. Everything seems normal until my phone buzzed. A text from Brett. You look incredible today. That dress is doing things to me. I looked up. He was staring at me, smiling. Lisa was talking to our mom, completely oblivious. Another text. We should grab drink sometime, just us. Then another. Your sister doesn't have to know. What happens between us? Days between us. I felt sick. This man had been married to my sister for three years. I took screenshots of everything. Then I noticed everyone at the table had iPhones. I opened airdrop, selected everyone, sent all three screenshots. Phone started buzzing around the table. My mom checked hers first. Her face went from confused to horrified. My dad's jaw clenched. My brother stood up. What the hell, Brett? Brett's face went completely white. What? What's happening? Lisa grabbed my mom's phone, read the messages, looked at Brett, then at me. Is this real? Check the number. I said quietly, it's his. She pulled out her phone, compared the number. Her hands started shaking. I texted my sister at Thanksgiving dinner while sitting next to me. Brett stammered, I was joking. It was just a joke. Which part was the joke? My dad asked, standing up. The part where you hit on her daughter, or the part where you said your wife doesn't need to know? I didn't mean. I was drunk. You've had one beer, my mom said coldly.

I repeated, yes, I'm 16. Mom and dad have been together since before I was born. Daniel grabbed my arm. Rebecca, let me explain. I pulled away, walked to the microphone at the front of the Pavilion, tapped it. Everyone, can I have your attention? The crowd quieted. Daniel was speed walking toward me.

I looked at Daniel, 16 years. I can explain. You have a teenager, a whole secret teenager. It's complicated. It's really not. I handed him the microphone. Your turn. Explain to everyone how you managed this. He stood there frozen. The woman, Sophia's mom, was yelling at her daughter. Sophia was crying. My sister grabbed my hand. What do you need?

Daniel tried following me to my car. Please, we can work through this. You have a 16 year old secret child. There's no working through that. I drove to my sister's house, filed for divorce the next morning. Daniel's been calling non stop. His family's been calling. Even Sophia's mom called to apologize. I blocked them all except Sophia.

My sister in law Denise had this thing where she'd smack the back of my head every single time she saw me and everyone acted like it was the funniest, most endearing work instead of straight up assault. It started at my wedding to her brother Tom when I was signing the and she walked up behind me and whacked me hard enough to make me drop a pen. She laughed and said welcome to the family. We're very hands on. Everyone chuckled like it was adorable hazing. Instead of her hitting me at my own wedding, after that, it became her signature move. Every family dinner she'd walk past my chair and smack my head while I was eating. Every birthday party, barbecue, holiday gathering, even at my father's wake, she'd find a moment to hit me when I wasn't looking. Sometimes it was hard enough to give me headaches. Sometimes she'd do it multiple times in one event. She'd always laugh and say it's how I show affection. Get used to. Tom thought it was hilarious and said Denise only teases people she likes. His parents said she'd always been playful and I needed to loosen up. Other relatives said it was harmless fun and I was being too sensitive about a little tap. But these weren't little taps. They were full force hits that Left my scalp stinging and my neck sore. I'd have migraines for days after family events just from anticipating when she'd strike next. I tried everything to make it stop. I asked her politely to please not hit me any.

Hazel smile completely vanished. Wait, what? Why would you do that? I just shrugged and said, that's how I like them, really needy. She sat back in her seat, clearly annoyed. Well, if I knew we weren't sharing, I would have ordered more food. This is ridiculous. Then order more, I said, still smiling. You can still add something. She crossed her arms. I'm trying to save money. I thought we were splitting like we always do. We don't always split. I said, I share with you. You never share with me. The nachos came out 10 minutes later and they were absolutely beautiful. The steak and chorizo were mixed throughout, buried under layers of cheese, jalapenos, sour cream and guacamole, completely impossible to separate. I grabbed the first chip loaded with meat and cheese and took a huge exaggerated bite. Oh my god, these are incredible, I said, looking right at her. Hazel just stared at her sad little eight dollar garden salad with barely any dressing and like six dairy tomatoes. She picked at it silently while I devoured my nachos, making sure to comment on how good each bite was. Every few minutes she'd make these passive aggressive comments like, wow, I'm still really hungry. Or, man, I wish I had ordered something more filling. Or those nachos look so good. I bet they taste better without all that meat. I responded to each one with the same cheerful energy. You should definitely order something else. They have great quesadillas or you could get tacos. But she never did because the whole point was to eat my food for free and save her own money. By the end of the meal, I'd finished every single nacho on my plate, licking the cheese off my fingers. She'd eaten maybe half her salad and was clearly miserable when the checks came. Hers was $11, mine was $19. She looked at the difference and said, wow, you spent so much more than me. Yeah, I said, because I actually ordered real food that fills you up. She didn't talk much after that, just scrolled on her phone looking annoyed. On the drive home, she kept mentioning how hungry she still was and how she'd probably have to stop up somewhere for food later. I just nodded and said, well, maybe next time you should order an actual meal instead of banking on sharing mine. She got really quiet and I can tell she was pissed. But honestly, I don't care anymore. I'm done being her free meal plan. She can either start ordering her own food or find someone else to mooch off of. The best part is this happened 3 days ago and she just texted me asking if I want to grab dinner tonight. I said, sure and suggested a Brazilian steakhouse where they bring you unlimited meat. She hasn't responded yet.

My friend Hazel and I have been going out to eat together for almost two years. And somewhere along the way she decided that her being vegetarian means she gets to eat my food but I can never eat hers. It started small at first. She'd ask for a bite of my burger or steal a few of my fries. But over time it escalated to the point where she basically plans her entire order around split in mind. The thing is I love sharing food with people. I'm the person who orders three appetizers so everyone can try everything. But with Hazel, it's different because it's completely one sided. She'll order a 7 dollar side. I'll then eat half of my 18 dollar entree and act like she's doing me a favor by keeping me company while I eat. I've tried bringing it up casually like, hey, wanna split an appetizer? And she always says, oh, no, I'm vegetarian, I can't and eat most of those things. But the second my food arrives, her fork is already on my plate. Two months ago, we went to a diner and she ordered oatmeal and fruit for $6. I got a full breakfast platter with eggs, bake and pancakes for $14. She ate three of my pancakes, half my bacon and didn't even ask. Last month we went to an Italian place and I ordered chicken Parmesan. She ordered minestrone soup and a small Caesar salad. The moment my plate hit the table, she said, oh, that looks amazing. Can I try some? I said, sure, thinking she meant one bite. She ate four full pieces of my chicken, taking all the cheese and sauce with it. When I suggested we split her soup, she laughed and said, oh, this is vegetarian. You wouldn't like it. There's no protein in here. I was fuming, but I didn't say anything because I hate confrontation and honestly, I didn't want to make things weird. So I came up with a new strategy, order only meat heavy dishes that she physically cannot share. Last week we went to this Mexican restaurant that we go to all the time. Usually I'd order something we could both enjoy, but not this time. I was genuinely craving nachos, but I knew if I ordered the regular ones, she'd demolish half of them while I watched. When the waiter came, I said, can I get the carne asada nachos, extra meat, please, and can you add chorizo, too? Hazel immediately lit up. Oh, perfect. Nachos are great for sharing. Can you ask them to put the steak on the side so I can have some, too? I looked directly at the waiter without breaking eye contact and said, actually, no. Can you mix the steak in really well? Like completely cover everything, make sure the meat is in every single bite? The waiter Looked between us, clearly sent.

We've been together eight years now, and honestly, everything's pretty solid, except for one thing. The food situation is insane. We split cooking 50 fifty in our house, which sounds fair until you realize I spend half her nights in the kitchen basically stalking her to make sure nobody dies. He undercooks literally everything. Meat, rice, pasta, you name it. And every single time I try to help, she acts like I'm being dramatic. Like, take rice. Basic rice package says 1 cup rice, 2 cups water. I've shown her this probably 15 times. Every time, she's like, wait, are you sure? That's way too much water. Then she does her own thing, and we end up eating crunchy, half cooked rice that sounds like gravel when you chew it. I just eat it and don't say anything, because what's the point? But here's where it gets worse. She loves hosting dinners. Like, really loves it. She'll invite friends over and insist on cooking everything herself, and I'm just trailing behind her, trying to save whatever I can. There's always at least two dishes that come out either weirdly salty or straight up raw in the middle. Our friends are nice about it. They'll take a few bites, push food around their plates, say it's great. But I've noticed they've started saying no to dinner invites more and more. Last month, she invited both our couple friends over on the same weekend, and They both suddenly had plans. So anyway, last Tuesday, I'm in the shower, and she decides to start making chicken. When I get out, like 10 minutes later, she's pulling it out of the oven, saying, dinner's ready. I'm like, what do you mean, ready? It's been 10 minutes. She goes, I seared it in the pan first, so it's fine. I walk over.

Forgot my laptop at home, had a presentation, turned the car around. My mother in law's car was in the driveway. Weird since she lived across the state. Walked in through the unlocked door, heard whisper voices from the kitchen. Mom, what if he fights me on it? I froze in the hallway. Sweet. He won't. Men never fight when there's a baby involved. Courts always side with mothers. But the house is in both our names, exactly half automatically. Plus with his salary, you're looking at serious child support and alimony. You'll be set for life. My wife laughed. I feel bad sometimes. He's been so excited building the nursery. Stop up. You're doing what's smart. He's boring anyway. So here's the plan. Baby comes, establish yourself as primary caregiver, then file claim he worked too much. Any judge will side with you. I'll move back with you. You get his money, I get my grandchild. Everybody wins except him. Her mom laughed. Meanwhile, you're living your best life on his dime. Context. Married three years. She was six months pregnant. We tried for two years before she can see. I've been at every appointment, painted the nursery myself. This baby was my whole world. The entire thing was a setup. I backed out quietly, drove to an electronic store, bought three voice Activated recorders, 400 bucks. At night. I planted them, kitchen, living room, bedroom, called in sick. The next morning her mom came over. Within an hour. They talked for hours. I got everything. How she'd stopped birth control a year ago without telling me. How her mom convinced her a baby was her golden ticket. How they'd already consulted a divorce attorney for maximum payout. He makes 130,000. You're looking at minimum 1,800 monthly child support. Push for 2000+ alimony, another 3 to 4,000 monthly. My wife giggled. That's more than I ever made working. Exactly. Why work when you can just collect? They high fived. I also found she'd opened credit cards in both our names without telling me. 15,000 in secret debt. Called my college buddy who's a family law attorney, played him the recordings. First question.

I'd given up on even trying to mention our anniversary. That's how many times my husband, Landon, had forgotten about it. But this year, his sister must have said something because two weeks after our missed anniversary, he insisted we should go to the Italian place where we had our first date. He didn't apologize or acknowledge what day we were supposedly celebrating. He just made a reservation and told me to wear something nice. We sat down at the same table where I'd patiently waited for him to arrive during the last three years. And every time he told me he couldn't make it due to work. I'd even grown close with the staff because they all joked about my ghost husband who was never here. Katie. Oh, my goodness. Llama, the waitress gasped with delight. You actually brought someone, she beamed at me, then turned to Landon with warm approval. I'm so glad she finally took my advice about bringing a friend instead of waiting. Landon glanced out, confused and, but Mama was already pouring water, gushing at me. Three years of sitting alone on your anniversary and you finally decided to move on. Good for you, honey, she winked at Landon. You must be the coworker she mentioned, the one who actually remembered her promotion. Landon's brow furrowed as Mama continued. Make sure to order the good wine tonight. She always gets the house. Red, since she's paying alone, she patted my shoulder sympathetically before walking away, leaving Landon staring at me. What was that about, he asked. I just looked at the menu. My chest tightening with three years of humiliation. The bartender walked by and did a double take. Llama is that, he gestured at our table. Llama nodded excitedly. Yep, she finally brought a date. No more Phantom Husband stories. The bartender laughed about time. Three years of he's running late got depressing. They weren't even being quiet. Landon's face was changing, his phone lowering to the table. Phantom Husband, he said slowly. A bus boy clearing nearby tables chimed in. Yeah, the lady who cries into her tiramisu. Every year we take bets on whether a guy will actually show up. Land, his jaw tightened. The sommelier approached with genuine enthusiasm. Ma'am, since you have actual company tonight, might I suggest a real bottle? Not like when you nurse a single glass. For hours, Landon was completely still now, watching the staff treat him like my savior while discussing my abandoned anniversaries, I remembered how alone I felt whenever I came here, how I'd wish that Landon would bring me a gift and pick me up and his car, but he'd always let me down. Llama returned with her notepad, still glowing with approval at Landon. You know, sir, she orders the same thing every anniversary, a Butternut squash ravioli. Her husband apparently loved it on their first date here. Landon was starting to squeeze his knuckles, realizing how badly he'd been ignoring his wife. She even brought him a gift once llama continued talking to him like they were conspirators, a Rolex. It sat wrapped on this table for four hours. She shook her head. Can you imagine forgetting your wife exists for three straight years? The sous chef passed by and called out, hey, is that the anniversary lady finally got smart and brought real company. Llama nodded proudly. Someone who actually shows up. Landon's breathing was getting shallow. I'm not, he started, but llama was already taking my order. The usual, honey, and for.

I found my work crush share, crying in the break room, looking completely stressed. My dad's in the hospital and I need to fly out tonight, but I can't find anyone to watch my kids. My ex won't answer. The babysitter I hired bailed. And I just, I can't afford to miss this flight, but I can't afford anything else either. She leaned against my shoulder, crying even harder. I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said. Heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids, 3 for at least two weeks. Waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest, around 14, looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work. Camilla, the middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, Kevin, wouldn't even look at me. They stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Cher hugged them quickly, told them to be good and left for the airport. I stood there with three kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. The first morning I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed, she's not here, you know, you can stop trying, she said. Besides, you're not Her type mom doesn't date guys without kids. We, I've seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Shares, co workers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps, everyone wanted to play dad until they realized 3 kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. Spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings. They hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive two weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy, be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it does doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Sometime within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Just leave me alone, he said. Turning away. I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you, get mad at you or do anything without your permission, not even tell your mom. But I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't have a dad. I Patted his head and thanked him, walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. The next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rental GTR, strikingly white engine, purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved, wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now, I said loudly as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop and quickly hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said. Grinning. I picked up the other two kids and took them to in and out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a helmet full of nachos and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. Not bad, old man, Camilla said. Watching her siblings enjoy the game, we made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard. I sent everything to their mom with a caption, we wish you were here. After that, things between me and kids sort of changed. When the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom, I sat beside her bed reading out fairy tales. Until she fell asleep. I made the kids meals and lunch box.

I told a teenage girl she was gonna get assaulted working the night shift at a truck stop and she kicked me out for harassment. I've been driving trucks for 12 years now and I've seen people, men especially, at their darkest late at night on the road. I started driving trucks after my daughter was born because it paid better than warehouse work. My route takes me from Dallas up through Arkansas and into Tennessee. There's this one gas station that I try to avoid like the plague. It's one of those places where the parking lot lights are half broken and there's always sketchy stuff going down. Some nightmare on Elm Street shite. Last time I was there, some tweaker tried to sell me a chainsaw at 3 in the morning. But sometimes you need gas and it's the only stop for 40 miles. This happened about six months ago. I pulled in around 11 at night and noticed something was different right away. The old guy who usually work nights wasn't behind the counter. Instead, there was this young girl who couldn't have been older than 19. She had bright purple hair and enough piercings to make her head explode in an MRI, full sleeve, tattoos on both arms too. She was reading a textbook when I walked in, so I figured she was a student. I grabbed an energy drink and some beef jerky and Went up to pay. You new here, I asked while she rang me up. Yeah, started last week, she said, without looking up from scanning. They had a help wanted sign in the hours work with my class schedule. My stomach dropped a little. This girl had no idea what she'd signed up for. So I told her very respectfully, listen, I don't mean to pry, but you might wanna find somewhere else to work. This place gets rough, especially at night. She finally looked up at me and her face went hard. I can take care of myself, thanks. That annoyed me a little, but I needed her to understand. I'm sure you can, but the drivers that come through here aren't your average cost. Some of these guys have been on the road for days straight. They get weird ideas in their heads, especially when they see a young woman working alone. Is that supposed to be a threat? Her voice got sharp. No, I'm trying to warn you. I've been stopping here for years and I've seen some bad stuff go down. You need to at least keep some heat under the counter for Protection. Get out. She pointed at the door. I don't need some random trucker man explaining danger to me that I can handle myself. I don't even know what man'splaining is. I said, look, I have a daughter about your age and I'd want someone to tell her before I could even say Anything else, she screamed out, before I call the cops and report you for harassment, I held up my hands and backed away. Fine, I tried. Some people just won't listen when you're trying to help them. I paid for my stuff and left without another word. Back in my truck, I popped open the energy drink and did my usual safety check. Tires looked good, load was secure. I was just about to pull out when I remembered I promised my wife I'd grab diapers on the way home. My wife just had another baby girl. She goes through them like crazy and we were almost out. I sat there for a minute to debate whether to go back in. The girl clearly didn't want me there, but I really needed those diapers. I waited about five minutes to let things cool down, then headed back inside. The store was empty. That purple haired girl behind the counter, I hoped for the best and told myself maybe she was in the bathroom or on break. Then I heard.

Uncle Wayne was worth millions, but lived like a miser, constantly testing our family to see who was worthy of his money. Every holiday was an audition where cousins would compete for his approval like desperate contestants on a reality show. I'm leaving everything to whoever proves they don't need it, he'd announce at family dinners while everyone kissed his ass and hung on his every word. My cousins would bring him expensive gifts they couldn't afford, offer to clean his house for free, practically beg for his attention and validation. They'd research his interests and pretend to share his hobbies. My cousin Kyle even switched his major to business because Uncle Wayne mentioned he respected entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, I brought nothing and sat in the corner reading a book, completely disinterested in his little power games. He doesn't seem to care about family, he'd say loud enough for me to hear. Testing to see if I'd scramble for his approval like the others. You're right, I'd reply without looking up from my book. I don't care about your money, either. This always made him pause. While my cousins were falling over themselves to prove their worth, I was actively proving my indifference. While they fought over who could drive him to appointments and grocery shop for him. I got a second job and Started saving every penny. While they argued about his will, I was building my own future. When they'd ask why I never visited Uncle Wayne, I'd say, he has plenty of volunteers. I found his manipulation disgusting. Watching grown adults debase themselves for money made me sick. I'd rather be broke with dignity than rich through desperation. My cousins thought I was crazy. Don't you want financial security? Anna would ask. I'm setting myself up without begging, I'd tell her. While they spent their weekends doing his yard work and running his errands, I was working overtime and taking online courses to improve my skills. While they were buying him birthday presents and Christmas gifts, I was investing in my education and building an emergency fund. The dynamic was fascinating to watch. The more desperate they became for his approval, the more he seemed to enjoy withholding it. The more I ignored him, the more curious he became about me. At family gatherings, he'd try to bait me into conversations about money and success. I'd give polite, brief responses and go back to whatever I was doing. I wasn't rude, but I wasn't performing for him either. Grace, what are your career plans? He'd ask in front of everyone. Working on it, I'd say simply not elaborating. This drove him crazy because he couldn't figure out my angle. Everyone else was transparent in their attempts to impress him, but I genuinely didn't seem to care about his opinion or his Money the day

I was in music class when I felt that familiar tingling in my fingers. I've been seizure free for three months, but I knew what was coming. Miss Blackwood, I need to get to the nurse. I said, already feeling the electricity building in my brain. I'm about to have a seizure. The substitute teacher rolled her eyes. Oh, please. Every kid suddenly has epilepsy now. It's trendy. No, you don't understand. The tingling was spreading up my arm. I had maybe two minutes before I lose consciousness. I have a seizure action plan in my file. Sit down. She stood up and walked to my desk, but instead of helping, she leaned over me. You know what my sister did when her daughter claimed to have seizures? She ignored them completely. Within a week, miraculously cured, Emily jumped up and ran for the emergency button by the door. She's not faking. I've seen her seizures before. The sub blocked her. The only thing seizing is her need for attention. Then she did something I'll never forget. She walked to the door, turned the dead bolt, and dropped the key in her pocket. Nobody leaves until she admits she's faking. This victim complex is destroying your generation. Call 9 1 1. Someone yelled, reaching for their phone. Phones in the box! Now!

The number my neurologist made me memorize. That's when my hated cousin Walsh decided to open his mouth. She used to fake seizures ever since she was little. The sub's face lit up. See? Even her boyfriend knows she's performing. She walked back to the Smartboard and pulled up YouTube. You know what really helps with fake seizures? She searched for flashing strobe light 10 hours and hit play. How's your therapy? If you were really epileptic, I wouldn't do this. But since you're faking. The screen exploded with rapid flashing. White, black, white, black. My brain felt like it was being electrocuted. Emily screamed, turn it off! Photosensitive epilepsy is real! The sub cranked the brightness to max. Psychosomatic reaction. She believes she's seizing, so her body mimics it. That's when David grabbed his head. I guess he had photosensitive epilepsy, too, because his whole body went rigid. I can't. The lights. Everyone lost it. Kids were diving under desks, throwing jackets over their heads. Turn it off! Turn it off! Malik was trying to cover my eyes with his hands. Please don't seize! Please don't seize! Ryan ran to the door and started slamming his shoulder into it. Help! Somebody help! The sub laughed. Sit down or you're expelled. Three other kids were now on the floor. The strobing was triggering something in everyone. Migraines, nausea, panic. Make it stop! Jenna was crying, hands pressed to her temples. Through Door. Window. Mister Peter from next door looked in. The sub stepped in front of the window, blocking his view of the chaos, and gave a thumbs up before pulling down the shade. He walked away. This is torture, Emily screamed. One minute left. I could feel my consciousness slipping. My muscles were already starting to twitch. This. I've actually turned the speed up on the strobe. When I was in school, nobody had seizures. Now suddenly everyone's neurodivergent. Thanks, social media. My body wasn't mine anymore. The seizure hit like a lightning bolt. Told me later. That's when things got really bad. My seizure was violent. Thrashing, foaming, turning blue. She tried to turn me on my side, but I was convulsing too hard. She's dying, Sarah screamed. My blood on her hands from where I bit in my tongue. The sub stood there eating an Apple. Oscar worthy performance, though the fake blood is a bit much. That's when Billy lost it. This sweet, quiet kid who never caused trouble. He grabbed a music stand like a battering ram. Violence, really. The sub pulled out her phone to record. This is going straight to the principal.

I made a spectacular show of checking every remaining backpack, every pocket, every desk, while those two Tried not to look smug in the back row, thinking they just discovered for the perfect hiding spot.

Marcus's dad screamed the trying to warn students repeatedly not to touch them. I said, pointing to my sign, Marcus, tell your father how poison Ivy got inside your underwear. The silence was delicious. We, we thought you were lying, Marcus mumbled. And, and I prompted. And we've been ripping up everyone's plants all semester, Kevin confessed. His mother's face morphing from rage to murder. When you search the class, we stuffed the leaves down our. You need to tell me. Kevin's mom cut him off, her voice deadly calm that you've been destroying teacher's property for months and then put poison Ivy in your underwear.

Said he snapped at teachers, threw a chair once, barely spoke to anyone, always wore a hoodie with the drawstring tight so you couldn't see his face. They wanted to expel him, but someone on staff suggested therapy first. I agreed to take him. First few sessions he just stared at the floor, shrugged a lot. I asked him his name, it's whatever. That was his answer for most things. But he kept showing up, always on time, always quiet. I noticed he never sat with his back to the door, always chose the corner. That's not nothing. So one day I said, look, you don't have to talk, but I'm gonna talk and you can interrupt if I'm wrong. I started guessing. People say you're angry, but I don't think you are. I think you're scared. I think something happened and you're still living inside it. Still no reaction. Then I left a deck of cards on the table, not normal cards, but this trauma therapy set. It has pictures instead of words. I told them, pick one that feels like your day yesterday. Picked a card with a shattered window, didn't say anything, just set it down and waited.

So growing up, everyone in my family called me mittens. My mom, dad, both brothers, even my grandma. It was constant, mittens, come eat, mittens, clean your room. Where's mittens? I just assumed it was a quirky little pet name. I mean, I liked cats, and I had tiny hands as a kid, so I figured it was something sweet about that. I even had a onesie with cat mittens sewn on it that I wore into elementary school. My lunch box said mittens. Had no reason to question it. It was just me. The nickname stuck all through childhood and into my teens. Teachers at parent night would call me mittens because that's what my parents wrote on my lunch containers. I didn't mind. I thought it was unique. At sleepovers, my friends would tease me about it, but I just shrugged it off. It's just what my family calls me. But deep down, I always kind of wondered why. There was no origin story, no cute moment that kicked it off. I just. Always been. I remember one day in seventh grade, my older brother brought a friend over, and the friend heard my mom call out, mittens, dinner! He paused and asked my brother, why do you call her that? My brother just grinned and said, it's a long story. Then they both started laughing. I was like, what? What's funny? But they Waved me off. Nothing. It's just a cute name. I dropped it, but it stuck in my head for years. Fast forward to high school. I'm a sophomore, and we're doing this icebreaker activity in Spanish class where we have to share our childhood nicknames and what they meant. I proudly told the class that mine was mittens and that it was because I had little hands and liked cats. That's when this kid, Tyler in the back, snorted and whispered something to the guy next to him. The teacher didn't hear, but I did. Bet she doesn't know what that really means. It bothered me all day. I went home and googled it. Nothing came up except, well, actual mittens. No. It stirred something in me. I started casually asking family members about the nickname. Everyone deflected. My mom said, you were just such a cozy baby. And my grandma said, your hands were so warm. But my brothers would exchange these smug looks and crack up when I brought it up. Then two Christmases ago, I finally found out. I was 24 and home for the holidays. We were doing our usual gift exchange. I got a big box from my dad. Inside, a brand new pair of fuzzy mittens with a note that just said full circle. Everyone burst out laughing. I smiled awkwardly and asked, okay, seriously, what's the deal with this nickname? My dad held up his hands like, okay, okay. It's time you knew. And my mom covered her face already laughing. So apparently, when I was a Newborn, I had this weird obsession with my hands. Always be chewing on them, sucking my fingers to the point where they were red and raw. They tried giving me pacifiers, teething rings. Nothing worked. But what did work? Putting baby mittens on me. Except I hated them. I would scream and cry and throw full tantrums trying to pull them off. One night, they caught it on video. Me in my crib, growling like a gremlin, struggling to yank off the mittens. But here's the thing. I'd only managed to pull one off. Then I'd stare.

So I'm dating Mitchell. He's 56, I'm 28. And, yes, he's rich. Like, really rich. We met at the Starbucks, where I was working on my laptop. He loved that I wasn't trying to get his attention and that I added to my coffee, in his words, more sugar than the Boston Harbor needed in 1773. But here's what six months of dating him actually looks like. Waiters hand him the wine list, never me. His friends, wives talk to me like I'm five, explaining what investment means really slowly. The valet gives Mitchell my car keys every single time. At his country club, someone always asks what I'm studying. I graduated four years ago. Last week, his lawyer asked if I needed help reading the dinner menu. It had seven items on it. Mitchell's company Christmas party is everything I expected and worse. I'm wearing this gorgeous Chanel dress that I bought myself because I liked it, and not even five minutes in, one of the wives pulls me into the bathroom. She puts her hand on my shoulder like she's about to deliver terrible news, and tells me I need to save the money Mitchell gives me for when this ends. When I mention having my own money, she laughs like I've told a joke and presses her friend's financial advisor card into my hand. He specializes in girls like me, apparently. Mitchell gets pulled into a work emergency, Leaving me at the bar where his call kids don't bother lowering their voices. How much do you think Mitchell spends on her monthly? One says, worth every penny at that age. Another answers, cheaper than my boat maintenance. When I approach and mention my startup work, they find it hilarious. One actually asks if Mitchell taught me the word portfolio. Another suggests I'm confusing shopping with investing. Then the boss himself walks over with his champagne and says the most insulting thing yet. When you and Mitchell are done, you should date my son. He's more age appropriate and needs a pretty girl. I say, I don't need anyone to take care of me, but he just pats my head like I'm a golden retriever. We all know what you need, sweetheart. I'm about to tell him exactly what I needed in that moment when I hear Mitchell's voice from the conference room. The door is cracked open, and he's on speaker phone, negotiating to buy a tech company. The seller is refusing his 10 million offer, insisting it's worth more, but won't explain why. Mitchell sounds increasingly desperate, repeatedly asking what he's missing. That's when my blood runs cold. I know this company. I know it intimately. I know exactly what Mitchell is missing. I push into the conference room. Before I can stop myself, Mitchell looks up, irritated at the interruption. He tells the seller on the phone, sorry, my girlfriend just wandered in. I'm already scanning the Paper spread across the table, confirming what I suspected. The seller's voice crackles through the speaker, asking what's going on. I state simply that the company has three major clients not listed in the disclosure. Mitchell freezes. The seller's voice turns sharp, demanding to know how I could possibly know that. Mitchell starts apologizing for my intrusion, while the CEO appears in the doorway. Mitchell, that's confidential information. You shouldn't be sharing these things. His wife laughs, suggesting I overheard something, and I'm trying to sound smart, but I continue.

By one PM, I had 43 people at my house, the biggest party I'd ever thrown. The ribs were falling off the bone, the beer was ice cold, and everyone kept thanking me for saving their weekend. Kids were splashing in the pool, adults were playing cards, and the whole neighborhood smelled like heaven. Meanwhile, Aunt Diana called me laughing. Lexi's reunion is a complete disaster. She ordered pizza for 30 people and only has six there, including herself. She's blaming everyone but herself and having a complete meltdown in front of what's left of the family. The best part? Three more family showed up uninvited because they heard through the neighborhood Grapevine about the legendary barbecue happening on Maple Street. Even people who weren't family wanted to join the party. My mailman stopped by after his shift ended. Lexi texted me again around three PM. This is all your fault. You ruined everything. Everyone's talking about your stupid party. I showed the text to Matthew, who just shook his head and said, she still doesn't get it, does she? She brought this on herself. I replied, I didn't ruin anything. I just took my contributions with me like you asked. Hope your six person reunion is everything you dreamed of. The party went until almost midnight. People were already asking when the next one would be. My neighbor Jeff said it was the best block party in years. Even the kids Didn't want to leave the pool. Three different people asked if I cater events. Lexi never apologized, but she also never planned another family event. Guess who got asked to host Christmas? The funniest part came two weeks later when Lexi tried to plan a makeup reunion and sent out a group text asking everyone to bring food and drinks. The responses were brutal. Pass. We're waiting for the next one at your brother's house. Why would we downgrade? Thanks, but we already know where the good parties are. She finally called me crying, asking what she needed to do to fix things. I told her the truth. You can't fix eight years of taking credit for other people's work with one apology. Lexi. Maybe next time. Don't bite the hand that feeds the family. Sometimes the best revenge is just being yourself and letting karma handle the rest.

I've never given a damn about plants, but watching sweet missus Brooks collapse over her grandmother's murdered African Violet flipped a switch in my brain I didn't know existed. What the kids called the Great Plant Massacre started innocently enough in September with a few missing leaves here and there that teachers wrote off as overwatering or underwatering. By October, these little psychopaths were stripping entire plants bare like piranhas on a cow carcass. These weren't accidents. This was botanical serial killing. Missus Anderson walked into her classroom to find her three year old orchid shredded across her desk. And she just stood there whispering, I grew that from a seed over and over, like she found a dead pet. Mister Thompson's ten year old bonsai got snapped in half like a wishbone. And when the kids destroyed the principal's fern and arranged the leaves into a wiener on his desk, even I had to admire their commitment. We're dealing with vandals, Principal Harrison announced at a staff meeting. And when we catch them, there will be severe consequences. Yeah, right. I thought these kids are running circles around us. And Harrison couldn't catch a cold in a preschool. Even the math teacher tried fake plants as a work around, but these little demons destroyed those, too. And use the plastic leaves to spell R I P. But everything changed in November when I Found Missus Brook sobbing over her smashed plant pot. Jake, she choked out. This plant was from my grandmother's funeral 12 years ago. I kept it alive through divorce, through cancer, through everything. And these kids destroyed it for fun. Those damn kids. I said, watching her hold a resignation letter. I can't do this anymore. She whispered, they win. That's when my teacher brain shut off, and something darker took over. Because nobody makes Missus Brooks cry. And these little psychopaths were about to learn that karma's a bitch. And she. It's about to throw hands. See, I'm genetically immune to poison Ivy, oak, and sumac, which sounds like a useless superpower until you need to use biological warfare on teenage terrorists. I actually cultivate poison Ivy along my back fence cause I'm petty and don't want the neighbor kids cutting through my yard. So I had a ready supply of nature's revenge growing right at home. That night, I carefully potted three beautiful poison Ivy plants and set them on my windowsill Thursday morning with a massive red sign. Danger. Do not touch poisonous plants. Yo, Mr. J, those really

I own a Laugh Factory franchise in Chicago, and usually our customers are a pleasure to host. Don't get too drunk, laugh at everything, always give compliments to the comedians on the mic. But this particular Saturday night, I witnessed something that made me question whether I should fire my top comedian, Princeton, or give him a raise. We were about two minutes from closing when this couple I didn't recognize walked in. The girlfriend immediately started apologizing to us, saying she knew it was late and they'd probably missed everything, but could they at least grab a drink before we closed. She seemed genuinely sweet, the kind of person who apologized to the Ducks when she didn't have any bread. So I let them into the bar. I was going to tell Prinston to serve them some alcohol and crack a few jokes anyway because it's Saturday night and why not? But before I could even say anything else to Prinston, the woman's boyfriend cut her off with this aggressive nudge that made my stomach turn. Ignore the woman, he said, rolling his eyes like she was a burden. Then the boyfriend actually snapped his fingers in her face like she was a dog and said, let the men talk. He then turned to Prinston and declared, we want two beers. Make sure they're large and make It snappy the way he said it with this smug grin like he thought he was the Shati, made me want to personally tell him to f off. But Prinston was already behind the bar reaching for the pint glasses, so I let it slide. That's when the girlfriend's face went red and she quietly said, actually, I just wanted to.

My wife died three years ago from what I was told was a sudden heart attack. My daughter, Olivia, was 9. My wife's best friend, Sophie, immediately stepped in to help. She was there every day, cooking meals, picking Olivia up from school, being the mother figure I thought my daughter needed. I was grateful Olivia seemed to be coping well with Sophie around. Sophie would tell me things like, don't worry, I. I promised Hannah I'd take care of you both. She'd show up with Olivia's favorite snacks. She knew her schedule better than I did. I actually thanked god for sending us someone who cared so much. But slowly things started changing. Olivia stopped hugging me good night. She'd flinch when I reached out to her. When I asked what was wrong, she'd say nothing and run to her room. I thought it was just grief that she blamed me for not saving her mom. Sophie kept reassuring me she's just processing. Give her time. I'll talk to her. And I trusted her. I trusted her completely. She'd take Olivia out for ice cream and they'd come back with Olivia looking even more withdrawn. I'd ask what they talked about. Sophie would smile and say, just girl stuff. Don't worry. I started noticing other things, too. Olivia would tense up whenever I walked into a room. She stopped showing me her drawings, stopped telling me about school. We used to Be so close now. There was this wall between us and I didn't know why.

My mom, because nothing says welcome home like you've gained weight, being the first words out of her mouth. I laughed and told her she was seeing things. But that night when my scale hit 160 pounds, 15 more than my usual 145, I realized the dryer hadn't been shrinking my jeans and my mom's eyes worked perfectly fine. I should have known something was seriously wrong three weeks later when Sarah had to help me squeeze into my backup shirt for girls night because my favorite top wouldn't zip. Maybe it shrunk. She offered, but we both, new clothes don't shrink that much. By the next month, the scale read 168 and nothing in my closet fit.

So I discovered my survival strategy, fruit adventure, Tik Toks, zero calories to keep my mouth busy while I basically stopped eating until this nightmare ended. The wedding dress disaster changed everything because when I had to buy one two sizes bigger, I knew something was medically wrong. My doctor weighed me at 175 pounds, 30 pounds heavier in just four months, and immediately ordered every test imaginable, thyroid hormones, cortisol, insulin. Three days later, her nurse called with this weird, hesitant voice saying the doctor wanted to see me immediately instead of next week. And when I asked what was wrong, she paused way too Long before saying the doctor would explain. The whole office acted strange when I arrived, like they'd seen my results and didn't know what to say. Here's where things got absolutely insane because the doctor spread out my test results like she was looking for Waldo. And everything was completely normal, thyroid hormones, insulin, cortisol, all of it perfect. Yet she kept flipping through pages asking about my diet. I told her I basically stopped eating, just living on salads and these zero calorie tip.

At every family gathering, Danny would corner someone with his theories and observations, trying to piece together our family's history like some amateur detective. The adults always brushed him off with nervous laughs and quick subject changes. Danny's always been too curious for his own good, they'd say, ruffling his hair. But there was something in their eyes when they said it, something that looked almost like fear. When Danny turned 25, he started getting really serious about genealogy research. He'd show up to Sunday dinners with printouts from ancestry websites and old newspaper clippings he'd found at the library. He was obsessed with filling in the gaps in our family tree, especially the relatives who seemed to just disappear from records. Around the 1980s, my parents and aunts would get visibly uncomfortable whenever Danny pulled out his research folders.

But then I lost my dad, too. When my mom passed away two years ago, my whole world broke apart. She was my best friend, my safe place, the only person who truly he saw me. Her death came just 3 months after I gave birth to my daughter, Lily. My mom never got to hold her. I'll never stop hurting over that. At first, my dad was destroyed, too. He barely talked. We both lived like ghosts in the same house trying to survive the grief. But only 8 months later, he met someone, Diane. I wanted to give him space. He deserves some happiness. But it didn't take long to feel like something was deeply wrong. Die and moved into my mom's house fast and suddenly it wasn't my mom's house anymore and it was hers. She started redecorating, throwing out old furniture, packing up my mom's clothes, replacing family photos. The living room where my mom used to read became Diane's yoga space. Even my mom's favorite mug vanished. When I asked about it, dad just said, we're starting fresh. My heart sank. Then I started noticing little things. Diane would lock certain cabinets, ones my mom used to keep her journals in. I asked my dad once where Mom's old boxes had gone. He shrugged and said Diane probably donated them. But a week later, I found one half burned photo in.

I'd gone to grab coffee and saw the screen light up. The preview showed. Enough, mom says we don't have to pretend anymore. Just be polite, like she's dad's roommate.

Everyone knew Ethan and Bella would end up married. Three years together, promise rings, the whole thing. Their families did Sunday dinners together every week. Senior year, Bella was applying to colleges. She'd been adopted as a baby and decided to write her essay about finally meeting her birth mother that summer. It was raw, emotional, perfect. She asked Ethan to proofread it one night while we were all studying at the library. I watched him read it on her laptop and I swear the color drained from his face. The essay described meeting her birth mom, Catherine, how Catherine got pregnant at 16, how her family forced her to give the baby up, how Catherine had kept one photo all these years, how they met at a specific Starbucks on Route 9. I remember Bella was so proud of that essay. She'd been working on it for weeks, crying while writing it, finally feeling like she understood where she came from. She kept saying how Catherine had the same laugh as her, the same way of tucking hair behind her ear, then stood up so fast his chair fell over. Bella asked him what was wrong. He just shook his head, grabbed his stuff and left without explanation. She looked at me completely confused. Did I write something offensive? Is the essay bad? I told her it was beautiful because it was. But Something in Ethan's reaction made my stomach drop. He didn't answer her calls that night or the next day. I found out later what happened.

She laughed when she told me that I didn't. That moment set the tone for the rest of my life. My brothers were treated like kings. My dad took them to fancy schools, bought them new bikes and always made sure they had the best. I was sent to a small, poor government school, no library, broken chair, big classes. But I worked hard anyway. I studied under street lights when the power went out. And somehow I got better grades than all of them. But even when I came home with metals and top marks, they brushed it off. My grandma once said, smart girls are still just girls. My dad said, let's see what she does with all that studying. Girls just end up in kitchens anyway. Still, I kept pushing. At 18, I got a full scholarship for writing. I was the first one in the whole family to earn that kind of opportunity. I brought the letter home, heart racing. My mom. Smiled softly. My dad glanced at it.

I was 13 years old when I met my husband in seventh grade, and we've been together ever since. We got married at 21, bought our first house at 25, and spent the next two years trying desperately for a baby. And last month, I finally discovered I was pregnant. When those two pink lines appeared on the test, I literally fell to my knees crying. He funny around in our kitchen until we were both dizzy and laughing like teenagers again. But something shifted. Three days later, I was digging through my purse for my car keys when Theodore pulled out a small bottle of men's Cologne from inside. It was the brand I didn't even recognize. Whose is this? His voice was quiet, controlled. What? I don't. I've never seen that before. It was in your purse, Lauren. I know, but I don't know how it got there. Maybe it fell in at the store or. Right. He said it on the counter. Still staring at it. Probably nothing. I genuinely had no idea whose it was because I don't even have male friends. We all know how that turns out. But a week later, he found a hotel key card in my jacket pocket. The Marriott Downtown, room 4:53. This time, he didn't ask, just held it up, waiting for a confession that didn't exist. Theodore, I promise I don't Know what that is? Three people have texted me that they've seen you with another guy. Holding his hand, his voice crack. Jason's wife saw you at Starbucks. And Mike from the gym. Even Mrs. Bridge next door. They all said the same thing. See me with who? There's nobody. Stop lying to me! He threw the key card at the wall. I'm not stupid, Lauren. I only love you. I'm living in your house. I'm pregnant with your baby. Are you? Those two words destroyed me. He filed for divorce the next morning. The next three weeks tore me apart piece by piece. The paternity test proved it was his baby. But that didn't matter anymore. Theodore would sob at night through our bedroom door. He'd lost 15 pounds. The prenup I'd signed at 21 suddenly felt like a noose. If I cheated, I'd get nothing. Just tell me who it was. He begged one night, his whole body shaking. Please, I need to know who. There's nobody, Theodore. I love you. Only you. How can you keep lying to my face? He called his parents that night. I could hear.

Instead of taking care of his kids, who were just 10 and 11, he started going out every night, clubs, bars, road trips, anything to avoid responsibility. Meanwhile, his kids stayed at home hungry. Every day after work, I went to their house. I cooked, cleaned, helped with homework and tried to give them love. I begged my brother to step up. He always shrugged and said, relax, they'll be fine. Then he'd leave for another party. I didn't call CPS because I didn't want to traumatize the kids even more. One morning he showed up at my door with two big suitcases. His kids were behind him, looking tired and scared, smiled and said, I'm leaving town for a long time. Take care of them. I'll pick them up when they turn 18. Before I could say anything, he ran to his car and drove off. Suddenly, I was a parent of two kids who weren't mine. My house felt too small. My money was tight and my life stopped. I never dated, never looked for a husband, never went out with friends. Every time I thought about leaving, I saw their faces and thought, they need me more than I need myself. Years went by. We celebrated birthdays, joined sports and Did school projects together. I helped them with college application.

Even my own mother texted me, we raised you better than this. Nothing else. When I tried calling, she didn't pick up. My sister let me move into her basement, but her husband pulled me aside after three days. Look, I'm sorry, but you need to find somewhere else. We have kids to think about.

Please, Lauren, just tell me the truth so I can move on. But there was no truth to tell. I felt so lonely that I started to get worried about my baby absorbing my stress hormones. I almost broke down during the first prenatal appointment with my gynecologist. Doctor badge, because it was the most gentle someone had touched me in weeks. She was halfway through the routine exam, measuring my belly and checking the baby's position when she suddenly stopped. I'm going to run a full panel just to be thorough. An hour later, she called me back into her office. My stomach dropped. In 11 years of Seeing Doctor Vag, I'd only been in that room once when she discussed my fertility options before Theodore and I finally got pregnant. Please have a seat. She close the door behind me. Is the baby okay? My voice came out strangled. The heartbeat looks strong, right? You said everything measured normal. The baby is perfectly healthy. She sat down across from me, pulling my chart closer. But there's something in your blood work we need to discuss. My mind raced through possibilities. Lauren, your test came back positive for chlamydia. The words hung there not making sense. That's, that's impossible. I've only been with my husband for 15 years. Only him. She looked at me with pity. The strain you have typically presents symptoms within four to six weeks of transmission. If you've never slept with anyone else, the only way you can have it is if Theodore slept with someone else. The room tilted as everything clicked. I wasn't the one who cheated. He was. He must have come close to being exposed and that's why he just spent weeks setting me up to take the fall for his affair. Also, he wouldn't have to pay child support. The tears streaming down my face weren't sadness anymore. They were pure relief that I had uncovered the truth. And now, two years later, when Theodore sends me court mandated money that I won in the divorce, I sit in my Manhattan penthouse with my baby girl and smile.

My mom is a housewife and my brother along with his wife is a high school teacher. My parents still live in a small townhouse my grandfather bought since the two of them grew up there, fell in love and had us, plus all their friends live there. Basically emotional attachment. I never try to hide my wealth. I just don't show off. For example, I prefer travelling by public transport because of traffic and parking. While my fiance drives a Range Rover, I have a Samsung. He makes fun of me for not owning an iPhone. I prefer not to spend thousands of dollars on a dress I'm only going to wear once. I also enjoy eating fast food rather than going to a Michelin starred restaurant. I admit I never told them how much my dad earns as I felt it was unnecessary anyway. I think he and his family assumed my family didn't have much money or something after getting Engaged, we went to his parents house for dinner where they asked me what I plan to do in the future. I replied that I was planning to quit my job after the wedding and work for my dad. They kind of got confused, mad or weird saying why I would quit such a high paying job and that if I was planning to push all financial burdens on their son. Well, they asked for a prenuptial agreement. I agreed. A couple of weeks ago, we started planning our wedding. In my culture, I am an Indian and he is white. We have big weddings and that is the only place we show our wealth. My parents were discussing how they want to invite over 250 people from our side since I will be taking over the business and its networking and having how they want to have two weddings, an Indian and a white. Now Indian weddings have a lot of functions spanning three to four days, all of which would preferably be hosted at five star hotels or if we follow my dad, he wants to rent a castle. His parents demanded that if we wanted to have an extensive wedding, we would be the ones paying, to which my dad agreed, saying he was going to pay for everything even if they didn't ask. As the wedding planning proceeded, my fiance and his family realised we were spending way more than they could afford. I guess that's When it struck them that my dad's business wasn't as small as they expected it to be, they did a Google search and found his company online and his net turnover every year, which is on the website and so on. Anyway, now his family is mad at me saying why did I hide the fact that I am this rich? I am pretty sure they want to cancel the prenup. I am not going to do that now since it was their idea. Well, his mom is harassing me.

So I called the one person she spent 20 years pretending didn't exist. Aunt Patricia stood up during dinner, tapping her wine glass like she was about to make a toast. Before we continue, everyone needs to know the truth about Riley. 40 relatives went silent. Forks stopped midair. She pulled out a thick Manila folder and set it on the table with a thud. I've documented everything, she said, opening it to reveal. Printed bank statement, text message, screenshots and handwritten notes. The lies, the manipulation. How she isolated my brother from his family after the accident. My dad, her brother, had a stroke two years ago. Massive left side paralyzed, speech severely impaired. I was 24, fresh out of college, when I became his full time caregiver. Patricia wanted him in a facility. I refused because dad had always told me he'd rather die than rot in a nursing home. She's after his money, Patricia announced, her voice rising. Look at these bank statements. Suspicious transfers every week. Thousands of dollars moving into her personal account. She held up the pages. My cousins leaned in to look. My grandmother pressed a hand to her chest. And these texts. She continued flipping through. Printed messages where she threatens him, tells him if he doesn't cooperate, she'll put him in a home anyway. Witnesses have seen her yell at him, seen the fear in his eyes. I Want my uncle? David nodded slowly. I visited last month. He looked terrified when Riley came into the room. Exactly, Patricia said, pointing at him. She's got him so scared he can't even speak up for himself. His own daughter is abusing him

Sir, do you have anything to say? I took a breath. I have cameras. The room went still. What? She said, I have security cameras throughout the house. They record everything. Her face changed. The tears stopped for just a second. I saw the fear. You what? I installed them two months ago, after my house was broken into. I looked at the officers. I can show you the footage. The female officer stood up. We'd like to see that. I pulled up the app on my phone, scrolled back to 20 minutes earlier, hit play. The footage was crystal clear. Kitchen time stamp. In the corner. Me at the sink, back turned, washing dishes. Her standing by the counter, looking at her phone. Then she looked up, checked to make sure I wasn't watching. And she slapped herself hard. The sound came through the speaker. Sharp. Undeniable. Then she started recording on her own phone. Started shouting. The officers watched in silence. When it ended, no one spoke. The female officer looked at my fiance. Her expression had changed. Cold. Professional. Ma'am, stand up. Please, I. I can explain. Stand up. She stood slowly. You're under arrest for filing a false police report. Wait, no, This is a misunderstanding. The officer pulled out handcuffs. You have the right to remain silent. My fiance looked at me. Really looked at me. Please, she whispered, don't do this. I said nothing. The officer cuffed her, let her toward the door. Why? She said. She was crying now. Real tears this time. Why would you do this to me? I watched her pass. Watch the officer guide her outside. Watch them put her in the back of the patrol car. The male officer stayed behind for a moment. Will need a copy of that footage for evidence. I'll send it, I said. He nodded, left. I stood in the doorway, watch the tail lights disappear down the street. Her phone was still on the counter. Screen cracked. Recording stopped. I picked it up, deleted the video, set it back down.

I read it five times sitting on my bed at midnight after a closing shift. Then I saved it and didn't tell a soul. Graduation came on a Saturday. Patricia insisted on throwing this massive party. She invited everyone from the country club, neighbors, my dad's business partners. She's spent the week cooking and decorating. During the party, she kept pulling people aside. That's my bonus. Daughter graduating with honors. We're so proud. She worked so hard. I just smiled and refilled chip bowls. Dinner time came. Patricia had everyone sit at the long table on the back deck. She stood up, wine glass in hand. I want to make a toast, she announced. To our graduate. We are so incredibly proud, even if we couldn't help financially the way we did with Austin and Bella. But some kids are just more independent. It builds character. Everyone murmured agreement. A few people looked at me with sympathy. The poor stepdaughter. I sat down my fork and stood up. Actually, I said, I have an announcement of my own. The table went quiet. My dad looked nervous. Patricia's smile flickered. I pulled out my phone, opened my banking app, turned the screen toward everyone. That's $47,000, I said calmly. Three years of working three jobs, been Saving since sophomore year. Patricia's wine glass froze halfway to her mouth. Austin leaned forward, squinting her at the screen. But that's not the announcement. I swiped to my email. The Yale acceptance letter filled the screen. I got into Yale. Full academic scholarship, four years, everything covered. Tuition, room, board, books. The $47,000, that's just my spending money. Complete silence. You can hear the neighbor's dog barking three houses down. I've known since January. I continued. Didn't tell anyone because, well, I'm not technically family. Right, Patricia? Patricia's eyes filled with tears. We would have celebrated, honey. We would have been so proud. I grabbed my bag from the chair, looked around at all the shocked faces. I'm moving to Connecticut next week. Already packed. Thanks for teaching me. I didn't need you. I walked out while everyone sat frozen.

At home she calls the refrigerator the cold box and thinks escalators are moving stairs. We just smile and move on. But at Grandpa's funeral, she'd been on her best behavior for two hours, sitting quietly in her black dress with the white collar, swinging her legs, whispering questions about why everyone looks so sad. Then the honor guard arrived. Seven soldiers in full dress uniform, crisp, silent. Their boots made this synchronized SoundOn the chapel floor that made everyone sit up straighter. They were carrying his flag folded into that perfect triangle. The whole room went completely still. Lily tugged my sleeve hard. Auntie, he whispered. But it was that kid whisper that everyone within 10 feet can hear. Are those the people Grandpa grounded? I froze. My sister's face went white. My mom closed her eyes. The, the veterans in the row ahead of us turned around. This old guy had to be at least 75 with medals covering half his chest, just stared at Lily. His face was doing this thing where you could tell he was trying so hard not to react. Sweetie, I whispered back, what do you mean grounded? She pointed directly at the honor guard. You said Grandpa trained people in the army. Like when I'm bad and you ground me, no TV, no iPad, just thinking about what I.

Not in the dramatic, you're dead to me kind of way. That would have taken effort. No, he just slowly erased me. Left me out of conversations, family photos, even holiday seating charts. Wanted a son who wore cuff links and talked about sales quotas over golf. Instead, he got me, the college dropout who started bartending at 22 and never stopped. To him, that made me a failure. A joke. And he made sure everyone else in the family knew it, too. So I stopped showing up to events. Quietly cut myself out of their perfect little photo ops. Until last weekend. My sister Tessa's wedding. Fancy venue. Marble floors, chandeliers that could kill a man. I wasn't invited to the engagement party or the bridal shower, but I did get a formal wedding invite from my mom. Probably because Grandpa Harold, the only person in the family who actually likes me, threatened not to attend if I wasn't invited. So I showed up. Black suit, clean shave, no entourage. I plan to blend in, smile, and leave before dessert. But, of course, that didn't happen. First thing I hear walking in, my dad's voice. Already drunk, already talking shit. Oh, Julian. You mean the bartender? He's probably Mixing rum and Cokes in some club downtown. He wouldn't last 10 minutes in a place like this. Everyone laughed, even my mom. I didn't say a word. Just clenched my jaw and walked in like I hadn't heard it. My hands were shaking. Not from embarrassment. I'm holding back. The bride and groom made their big entrance. Tessa looked surprised to see me. James, her new husband, didn't know who I was. Not yet. Eventually they made their rounds and came up to me. Tessa smiled like it hurt. Julian didn't know you were coming. You invited me, I said. She glanced away. James stuck out his hand. Nice to meet you, he said. I'm Julian.

Tanner laughed and grabbed another sign. He ripped it in half. Then he shoved a crate of tomatoes off the table. It crashed and tomatoes rolled everywhere. Alexis screamed, why are you doing this? People stopped and stared. Tanner smiled at the crowd. Because she's a selfish little brat who thinks she's special. Then he grabbed the table and flipped it. Everything went flying.

I smiled and said I understood. Then at the family dinner, I made an announcement that left everyone speechless. Growing up in my dad's house after he remarried was like living as a permanent guest. Trisha moved in when I was 10, bringing Austin and Bella with her. Suddenly, I went from only child to invisible middle kid. Austin got enrolled in private school, soccer camps every summer, brand new car at sixteen. Bella got dance lessons, a sweet 16 that cost more than my dad's first car. Me, I got to talk about being grateful. Hand me downs from Austin, community sports programs if they had space. My dad never said much. He just nodded when Patricia made decisions. When I brought up college during sophomore year, she looked at me like I'd asked for a yacht. Community college is perfectly fine, she said. Maybe get a job to help with tuition. You know, we're stretched thin. With Austin school and Bella's activities, I knew exactly how thin they were. Stretched? Not very. Dad's accounting firm was doing great. They bought a vacation house in Michigan. But apparently the stretch only applied to me. That's when I made my decision. If I wanted something, I'd have to get it myself. I started working at 15, stocking shelves at the grocery store, 5:00am shifts before school, then tutoring kids in my neighborhood with math and Science. By junior year, I added weekend shifts at an Italian restaurant, three jobs. Every paycheck went straight into savings. While Austin partied, I was serving tables. While Bella went to the mall, I was teaching algebra. Patricia would make comments. You're always working. You should enjoy being young. Easy to say when someone else pays for everything. Senior year arrived, Austin was already at Northwestern on the family dime. I was planning her college tour of East Coast schools, all expenses paid. That's when Patricia pulled me aside. Listen, she said, pouring wine. Graduation is coming up. I want to manage expectations. We did big gifts for Austin and Bella, but things are different with you. You're not technically ours. We love you, but it's different. I nodded. Totally get it. She looked relieved. I knew you'd understand. You've always been so independent anyway. What Patricia didn't know was that I've been planning for months every college.

My dad snorted when I walked in. Then my sister's new husband shook my hand and froze. He turned pale, looked me up online, and suddenly everyone went silent. My dad likes to pretend I don't exist. Not in the dramatic, you're dead to me kind of way. That would have taken effort. No, he just slowly erased me. Left me out of conversations, family photos, even holiday seating charts. Wanted a son who wore cuff links and talked about sales quotas over golf. Instead, he got me, the college dropout who started bartending at 22 and never stopped. To him, that made me a failure. A joke. And he made sure everyone else in the family knew it, too. So I stopped showing up to events. Quietly cut myself out of their perfect little photo ops. Until last weekend. My sister Tessa's wedding. Fancy venue. Marble floors, chandeliers that could kill a man. I wasn't invited to the engagement party or the bridal shower, but I did get a formal wedding invite from my mom. Probably because Grandpa Harold, the only person in the family who actually likes me, threatened not to attend if I wasn't invited. So I showed up. Black suit, clean shave, no entourage. I plan to blend in, smile, and leave before dessert. But, of course, that didn't happen. First thing I hear walking in, my dad's voice. Already drunk, already talking shit. Oh, Julian. You mean the bartender? He's probably Mixing rum and Cokes in some club downtown. He wouldn't last 10 minutes in a place like this. Everyone laughed, even my mom. I didn't say a word. Just clenched my jaw and walked in like I hadn't heard it. My hands were shaking. Not from embarrassment. I'm holding back. The bride and groom made their big entrance. Tessa looked surprised to see me. James, her new husband, didn't know who I was. Not yet. Eventually they made their rounds and came up to me. Tessa smiled like it hurt. Julian didn't know you were coming. You invited me, I said. She glanced away. James stuck out his hand. Nice to meet you, he said. I'm Julian.

He built a nursery, bought a stroller that cost more than my car, posted daily bump updates like a proud dad. The baby shower was packed. Food, balloons, gifts, everything blue. Jessica was glowing in a flowy dress, belly looked legit. David kept introducing her as the glowing mama. She smiled like a queen, acted warm, hugged everyone.

He's moving like crazy. You have to feel him. Women lined up touching her stomach. Everyone was smiling. Then she turned to me. Michael, you're the expert. Come feel your nephew. I hesitated. I don't like crossing medical boundaries at family events. But she look so excited. Everyone was watching. Sarah gave me a nudge. I stepped forward, place my hand on her belly and everything froze. I felt thousands of fetal movements in my career. This wasn't one. It was light, shallow to surface level. There was no depth, no pressure, no resistance. And the rhythm way too perfect.

Me and Virginia were sitting in the school canteen when she grabbed my arm and said, you have to help me get Ronan. You know him better than anyone. My stomach dropped. I'd had feelings for Ronan since freshman year, back when we got paired for Chemistry Lab and he'd make these terrible science puns that somehow made me laugh every time. Virginia's grip on my arm tightened. Please. You're his lab partner. You know everything about him. Her eyes were desperate in a way I'd never seen before. The thing was, she wasn't wrong. I did know everything about him. How he took his coffee with exactly two sugars. How his eyes lit up when he talked about league of legends, that game he pretended not to love. If you're really my best friend, you'll do this, Virginia, you said. And those words hung between us like a threat wrapped in a plea. So I did what I always do. I gave in. Over the next week, I watched my advice work perfectly. Virginia showed up with Ronan's exact coffee order. Caramel macchiato, extra shot oat milk. How did you know? He asked, genuinely surprised. Just guessed, she said with his practiced smile. The weird thing was, whenever I saw them together, Ronan seemed happy enough, friendly, even. But Virginia acted like they were already married. Don't third wheel us at lunch anymore, Virginia told me. One Tuesday, not even looking up from her phone, I started eating in the library, watching from across the courtyard as Ronan laughed at something Virginia said, probably one of my jokes she'd memorized. By the second week, Virginia barely acknowledged me, except when she needed more Intel. What else does he like? She'd text at midnight. When I hesitated to respond, she got nasty. Stop being jealous. It's pathetic. The word stung because part of me wondered if she was right. Virginia started telling everyone Ronan was her boyfriend, posted hard launch photos of them studying together with heart emojis, called him babe in the hallways. But something seemed off. Whenever she tried to hold his hand or lean into him, he'd shift away, distracted by something else. We're so perfect together, Virginia gushed to our friend group. But when someone asked Ronan about his girlfriend later that day, I overheard him say, Virginia? Yeah, she's nice. We study together sometimes. One Thursday, I was across the cafeteria pretending to read when Ronan got excited, telling Virginia about this league tournament coming up. I love that game! She said way too loud. Ronan's face lit up. Really? What role do you mean? Virginia smiled, froze. The strong one. Ronan looked confused, but kept trying. Wanna play duo queue sometime? I could teach you the basics. I'm actually super busy, Virginia said quickly. Be another time. Ronan nodded, but I saw the disappointment flash across his face. That afternoon, I was in the library on my laptop watching a live stream when Ronan walked in. His face changed completely when he saw what was on my screen. No way you play league? I pulled up my match history to show him this jungler route I've been perfecting. Ronan's eyes went wide. Wait, this exact build? Virginia sent me a screenshot of her games yesterday. This is literally the same. He looked at my username, then at his phone comparing the build side by side. But this is your account. Before I could explain, Virginia walked in, saw us with my laptop open.

I was 12 years old when I walked in on my dad cornering my younger brother, Jeffrey. His shirt was off, and he was undoing his belt buckle. Just 30 minutes ago, he put me to bed early, saying Jeffrey needed help with a school project, and I couldn't distract him. I remember quietly tiptoeing back out of the room before grabbing my cell phone to call my mom. She'd been divorced with dad for two years by this point. Dad had forced me and Jeffrey to lie in court about her laying hands on us, and the second he got custody, he forbade us with any contact from her. This wasn't my first time speaking with her, though. We maintained regular contact, mainly because me and Jeffrey were so scared of dad, and she seemed like the only safety net we had. The problem was, mom was no saint, either. Yeah, she loved us, but immediately after losing in court, she left for some rich dude in Brazil and never texted us first. This was different, though. I remember pleading for her to pick up, and thankfully, she did. I wasted no time telling her what was happening on the other side of that wall, even making sure I left enough quiet time so the phone could pick up Dad's grunting and Jeffrey's muffled. I remember mom going quiet, and then she started crying. Real, genuine, angry tears. Not again were the only words she managed to get out. What do you mean, not again, mom? I quietly asked your dad. Sweetie, he. I'll explain later. With that, she hung up the line. And at that exact moment is when my bedroom door creaked open. It was dad walking a now limping and broken, sobbing Jeffrey into bed. I remember my heart in my chest, planting my head down into the pillow so fast, hoping he hadn't noticed or heard me talking to mom. Thankfully, he hadn't. I put Jeffrey to bed before giving him what sounded like a soft kiss on the cheek and telling him he did good today. After he left the room, I waited a little, just until Jeffrey stopped full on crying, before placing my hand on his shoulder. I told him I saw. Please don't tell anyone. He shot back. My brain malfunctioned. What do you mean, don't tell anyone? Dad said if someone found out, I'd be in big trouble. They put me in jail. My heart shattered immediately. I reassured him that he wouldn't be in trouble. I told him that what dad was doing was wrong, that we needed to tell someone. He looked to me like I had just broken his world, so it's not my fault. When he takes me into the bathroom, my heart shattered even more. I told him no. And right then is when my mom texted me back. She Had sent me a screenshot of her booked flight tickets. She was coming back the very next day. I tried my best to act like nothing was wrong. I greeted dad in the morning, watched him make my cereal, and pretended like I wasn't disgusted when he told me to go to school alone so he could finish helping Jeffrey with project. I remember being in school when mom called me. I've just landed. I remember feeling genuine hope. I asked her to please come over around 6. That's roughly when dad would be heading out for the bar. She told me, no problem. She said she'd be there on the dot. I ended up at home an hour early after skipping my final class, and when I walked in, I found dad lounging around shirtless, claiming it was just too hot. It was 67 degrees. I remember asking where Jeffrey was. I had something cool to show him, and his face just flashed. He told me to just go upstairs and he get Jeffrey shortly. Sure enough, he did. And when I saw Jeffrey and dad left, I explained everything to him. How mom was coming, how we were going to help him, how there was nothing that would stop us from getting justice. I saw him, in voluntarily flinch when I mentioned mom. He looked like he meant to say something, but I cut him off and told him it was okay. She would help us. He kind Of just went quiet. I figured it was just fear. At 6, as expected, dad started getting ready for the bar. Me and Jeffrey were sitting in our room sweating, waiting for the doorbell to ring. Mom was about to come in and save us. Only she never did. 6:05, then 6:10 for some

Twelve hours later, it was gone. Sold. Dad smiled. Consider it downsizing. I didn't argue. The next morning at 9:00 am when their doorbell camera lit up, mom screamed so loud the dog hid under the table. It started two weeks before everything went sideways. I was at their house for Sunday dinner when mom mentioned her Lexus was making a weird noise thing about the transmission. She said the shop couldn't look at it until Wednesday. Can I borrow your Honda tomorrow just for groceries and maybe the pharmacy? I didn't hesitate. Tossed her my keys right there at the table. She'd borrowed it before. No big deal. Monday came and went. Tuesday afternoon I got home from work and realized I needed my gym bag from the trunk. Walked outside, driveway was empty. I stood there confused for a solid minute before calling her. Hey, where's my car? Oh, long pause. We sold it. I actually laughed, thought she was joking. What? Your father and I are downsizing. We don't need three vehicles. The buyer gave us 8, 200 dollars cash. Really good deal. Honestly, my stomach dropped. Mom, that's my car. Well, you can use the Lexus whenever you need it. We're family. What's the. I couldn't form words. Before I could respond, I heard my dad's voice in the background. Then he was on the phone. Listen, you're 26 years old. Time to stop being so materialistic. We did. Did you a favor. You'll thank us later. Then he hung up. I sat on my couch staring at nothing for probably 20 minutes. My brain couldn't process what just happened. They sold my car. My car, the one I've been making payments on for three years, the one with my name on the title and registration. I called my insurance company first explain the situation. The agent confirmed the vehicle was still registered and insured under my name. She suggested I file a police report. Then I called Marcus. He's a buddy from college who works in criminal law, does a lot of auto theft faces. I told him everything. He was quiet for a few seconds, then he started laughing. Dude, your parents just committed felony grand theft auto. Like textbook. What? They took a vehicle without the owner's consent and sold it for profit. Doesn't matter if they're your parents. That's a third degree felony in most states. I felt my hands shaking. So what do I do? You want me to scare them or do you want to actually press charges? Thought about it, about every time they'd overlooked, every time they made decisions for me like I was still 12. Every time dad dismissed something I cared about because he knew better scare them. For now, Marcus said he'd draft something official, make it look serious, give them 72 hours to return the vehicle or face criminal prosecution. I'll send it tomorrow morning. 9:00am sharp, they'll have it in their inbox before their first coffee that night.

Last weekend my sister brought her daughter Casey over for our annual family barbecue. Casey's 13 and has this attitude that makes you want to hide in the bathroom until she leaves. She walked in wearing this pure white sundress that probably cost more than my car payment, acting like she was at some fancy country club instead of my backyard. My sister immediately starts with the warnings. Don't let her near the dirt. Watch out for the grass stains. Keep her away from anything messy. She spent like five minutes listing everything that could possibly ruin the precious dress. I rolled my eyes, but whatever. I figured I'd just keep an eye on her. The thing about Casey, though, is she's got this talent for being awful to people when adults aren't watching. The second my sister went inside to help with food, Casey started her usual routine. I told my 6 year old son Tyler that his superhero costume was stupid and that he looked like a baby. Tyler's face just crumpled. Then she saw our neighbor's kid Marcus playing with his toy cars in the dirt and she walked right over and kicked sand all over them, called him gross for playing in the dirt. Marcus is only 4 and he started crying. I told her to knock it off, but she just shrugged and walked away like nothing. Happened the final straw was when she found my mom's flower bed. My mom had been working on these roses all summer. They were her pride and joy. Casey decided it would be fun to pick a bunch of them and throw the petals around like confetti. When I caught her, she was literally ripping the heads off the flowers and tossing them.

Every night at exactly eleven forty seven PM, he sends the same text. Good night, bro, love you. I started screenshotting them last month. I have 34 now. Sometimes I zoom in on the love you part like a complete psycho. It's started in September. We were at his house playing video games, and he just casually said, love you, man. When I left, I thought about it the entire drive home. My hands were shaking on the steering wheel. After that, the text start. Every single night. Even when he was on vacation with his family. Even when I knew he was at parties. 11:47 p m. Like clockwork. I tried dating girls to prove I was normal. Went out with Samantha from my English class twice. She was nice, pretty, into me. When she tried to kiss me in her car, I panicked and said I had to go because my mom was calling. My mom was literally asleep. Last Tuesday, we were studying for finals in his basement. He was lying on the couch reading his history notes out loud. And I was on the floor pretending to take notes, but really just watching him. The way he bites his lip when he's concentrating. The way he runs his hand through his hair when he's frustrated. Then he just passed out. Head tilted back, mouth slightly open, notes scattered across his Chest. I should have woken him up. Instead I sat there frozen as he shifted and his head landed on my shoulder. I didn't move for two hours. My entire left side went numb. My leg fell asleep so bad I had pins and needles. But I just sat there watching his chest move up and down, terrified he'd wake up and see the way I was looking at him. When he finally woke up, he stretched and said you're comfy and smiled at me. I thought I was going to throw up. The worst part? He started dating rain in October. She's perfect for him. Tall, genuinely funny, into the same indie bands he likes. Look good together. Everyone says so. I watched them kiss in the parking lot last week after school. They were leaning against his car and she grabbed his jacket and pulled him in. I stood there like an idiot pretending to look for my keys for five minutes. Then I texted him that I had to skip our usual Friday movie night because I was sick. He showed up at my house 20 minutes later with soup and medicines. Sat on my floor for three hours playing me songs on his guitar until I felt better. I wasn't even actually sick that night. Eleven forty seven PM. Good night bro. Love you. Feel better. I stared at that text until 2:00am yesterday morning. My phone buzzed at 7:15. Him. Breakfast before school. Just us. When I got to the diner, rain wasn't there. Just him sitting in our usual booth, looking weird, nervous. He was playing with the sugar packets, stacking, unstacking them. Can I ask you something weird? He said without looking up. I nodded, suddenly very aware of my own heartbeat. Do you ever feel like you're supposed to want something, but you just don't? My mouth went dry. I asked what he meant. He stared at his hands for what felt like 10 minutes. The waitress came by twice. We both ignored her. Finally he looked up. I broke up with rain last night. I didn't know what to say. I managed to ask if he was okay. I told her I couldn't keep pretending I was into her when I'm clearly into someone else. He was still staring at me. Someone I've been too scared to tell for the past six months because I thought he was straight and I didn't want to ruin everything. He. The word hung in the air between us. I froze. Completely locked up. Couldn't breathe. He slid his phone across the table. It was open to our text thread, but not just the messages. A folder. A screenshots folder. All 34 of my screenshots were there. Every single. Good night, bro. Love you. I'd saved. I noticed you screenshotting them, he said quietly, around message 6. So I started screenshotting yours, too. He scrolled down. There were dozens more screenshots of random texts I'd Sent him good morning texts, memes. I'd shared a photo I sent him of a sunset. All saved, all dated. I have 127, he said. I counted last night. My hands were shaking so bad, I had to put them under the table. So he said, I'm either about to make the best decision of my life or completely destroy our friendship. But I really need to know if you feel the same way. I do. I could inform words. I just nodded. He smiled. Actually smiled this huge, relieved smile I'd never seen before. Prom's next month. He said, Wanna go with me? Like, actually with me. I'm still trying to process the fact that he's been screenshotting my texts for six months. We're going to prom together. And he just texted me good night 10 minutes early tonight. It said, good night, I love you. No, bro. This time.

Uncle Joe took it hard. But honestly, we all thought he'd grieve for a while and maybe start dating someone his age eventually. Instead, six months ago, he told my mom he was going back to visit family in Lebanon, said he needed closure or whatever. We didn't think much of it. Then last month, my mom calls me sounding all weird. She's like, Joe asked me something and I don't know what to tell him. Turns out Uncle Joe met this girl named Rania while he was over there. She's 19, 19. His oldest kid is 32. He has grandkids who are closer in age to this girl than he is. My mom tried to act all casual about it, but I could tell she was freaked out, too. She kept saying stuff like, well, he's lonely and everyone deserves companionship. My dad just shrugged and said, if Joe wants to get married again, that's his choice. I kept emphasizing that Rania is technically an adult, so it's not illegal or whatever. But here's the thing, Uncle Joe hasn't told his kids yet. Not a single word. My cousins have no idea their dad is about to bring home someone younger than them who's gonna be their stepmom. He's been doing all this paperwork for her visa and planning this whole wedding and his own kids don't even know she exists. I see Uncle Joe at family dinners and I literally can't look. At him. Last Sunday we had this big lunch at my parents house and he's sitting there eating my mom's kibay acting totally normal. Meanwhile, I'm sitting across from him knowing he's got a teenager's Instagram photos saved on his phone. It made me wanna throw up. My cousin Danny texted me last week asking if Uncle Joe seemed okay. Lately he said his dad's been acting distant and won't really talk to him about anything real. I just replied, yeah, he's probably still grieving your mom. What else was I supposed to say? Hey Danny, your dad's engaged to someone who was in elementary school when you graduated college. The worst part is I know exactly what's happening here. Ronnie is from a small village outside Beirut. Her family probably doesn't have much money. She sees this American guy who can get her a green card and a life in the U. S. And obviously she's gonna say yes. I don't even blame her for it. If I was 19 and poor and someone offered me a ticket out, I'd probably take it too. But Uncle Joe, he should know better. He's got kids and grandkids and a whole life here. His daughter just had a baby last year. His son is trying to start his own business and instead of being present for any of that, he's flying back and forth to Lebanon buying jewelry for a teenager. My mom keeps defending him. She said Joe told her That Rania makes him feel young again, that she doesn't look at him and see an old man. She sees someone strong and capable. I was like, yeah, mom, that's because her frame of reference is probably guys her age who work at coffee shops. Of course, the 57 year old man with a paid off house looks good to her. I asked my mom if she thinks Rania actually loves him or if she just wants the citizenship. My mom got all quiet and then said, does it matter if they're both getting what they need? Which is honestly the most depressing answer I've ever heard. Uncle Joe finally told his kids last week. Danny called me literally 10 minutes after he found out. He was yelling so loud I had to hold the phone away from my ear. He kept saying, this is insane, right? Tell me this is insane. His sister Amy apparently hung up on their dad and hasn't answered his calls since. Wedding is supposed to be in three weeks. Uncle Joe is doing the small ceremony at the courthouse and then having a dinner at some restaurant. He invited the whole family. My mom's trying to convince Danny and Amy to come because he's still their father. Danny told her he'd rather eat glass. I still haven't decided if I'm going. Part of me thinks I should go to support my cousins by not supporting this. But another part of me thinks maybe I Should go. So Uncle Joe isn't completely alone with his 19 year old bride and her family who probably don't speak English. My dad said Uncle Joe already bought Rania a car, a brand new s U. V. Because she's gonna need something reliable. Meanwhile, Danny's been driving the same beat up Ford for six years because he can't afford anything else. Uncle Joe has never offered to help him. Amy told my mom that their dad used to lecture her about boys when she was in high school, said she was too young to know what she wanted and needed to focus on school. Now he's marrying someone who's barely older than Amy was during those lectures. The whole family group chat has been dead silent since the news broke.

It hadn't shrunk afterward, nor had she experienced any side effects. She grabbed my hands and placed them on her breasts. I was so shocked that I unconsciously broke her heart. She grown. Be gentle, Rena. It was then that I believed she wasn't lying. I couldn't help but think that this was the perfect solution. Ahem. Could you recommend a doctor, Aya? I have a friend who's really frustrated about this. Thanks a lot, Stephanie. I smiled awkwardly as I asked Stephanie for the clinic's website so I could make an appointment. I didn't expect it to be any different from the other clinics, which were usually cold and austere. In fact, this one was kind of cute and cheerful. The first thing I saw on the website was that it was 95 years away from becoming a century old planet. Look through the information on the website and soon came across several examples of successful cases. The most recent was a photo of Stephanie. Her face wasn't in the picture, but I recognized her by the tattoo on her torso. Website also showed good reviews all over. This solidified my desire to make my chest grow through massages. Just like that, I plucked up the courage to go to the massage and body sculpting clinic on one of my days off. Wearing a mask and cap, I looked like a Spy. As I approached the receptionist. Hi, I have an appointment with Doctor Gold. Before the receptionist could say anything, a man in a white coat who looked about six feet tall, approached me. Hi, are you miss Sabrina Grant? You have an appointment for a massage and body sculpting. Right. I'm James Gold. Come with me, please. He reached out to take my bag. He put an arm around my shoulder and LED me into the room. I stood inside, feeling so awkward and embarrassed, but I couldn't stop playing with the hem of my shirt. James laughed. I can understand your concern, Miss Grant, but a doctor doesn't pay attention to the gender of his patients. It's too hard for you. You can always think of me as a potato. He could tell I was nervous about having a male doctor, so he took off his mask and smiled to ease my nerves. Without his mask, I could see how handsome he was. His eyes crinkled when he smiled, and his long eyelashes made him look at me tenderly. He had a large nose and his lips were a healthy red. I was stunned by his appearance. Then I complimented him. I can't do that. Even if you were a potato, you'd still be handsome. His smile grew. Then he put on a pair of gloves and pointed to the massage table next to him. Thank you for the compliment, Miss Grant. Now, please take off your top. And bra. And lie on your back. I shyly undressed and lay on the massage table, breathing softly. James pinched and lifted as he examined me. Then he rubbed me. I blushed and began to react down there, but soon he frowned. That scared me a little. What is wrong? Am I unfit for the massage? You are not in the best position for me to determine the best place for the massage, Miss Grant. You also seem to have other gynecological problems, he said. I was taken aback by his words and sat up anxiously. Really? That shouldn't be the case. I don't sleep around. He waved his hand with a smile when he saw how nervous I was. I don't mean that, Miss Grant. You don't have to worry about that. I just have a hunch about something. I'll have to do a more thorough check to be sure. You're not in the best position for me to detect anything, so I'm going to have to ask you to remove your pants. Kneel on the massage table. That's the best way I can see you. My period had been irregular for several months. At night I would also get, so I did as I was told. I held one arm across my chest while I spread my legs and knelt on the massage table in an embarrassing position.

She mocked me and posted a photo in his arms. But when she came back and saw who owned the Bentley in her spot, she went pale. I'm still processing what happened, so bear with me. My wife Cassandra and I have been married for nine years. We met in college, built a life together, and I thought we were solid. Then Trevor entered the picture. Trevor was her new coworker at the marketing firm where she worked. At first, it was innocent. She'd mention him casually, talk about projects they collaborated on. But over three months, his name came up more and more. Late night texts, weekend coffee, meetings to discuss campaigns. I tried talking to her about boundaries, but she brushed me off every time. Then she announced she was going on a seven day Caribbean cruise with Trevor and three other co workers. She claimed when I asked who else was going, he got defensive and changed the subject. That's when I knew something was deeply wrong. The night before she left, I sat her down. Cassandra, if you get on that cruise with him, I'm done. I won't be here when you get back. She laughed in my face. Actually laughed. Said I was being paranoid and controlling, that I needed therapy for my trust issues. Two days into her cruise, she posted a photo on social media. Her and Trevor arms wrapped, Around each other on the ship's deck. Sunset behind them. No other co workers in sight. The caption read, living my best life. I stared at that photo for an hour, feeling everything inside me go numb. I didn't waste time. I called my lawyer that afternoon and started divorce proceedings. Then I did something I've been planning for months, but kept delaying because of Cassandra. I accepted a job offer in Seattle. The position came with a massive salary increase, and the company was covering my relocation expenses, including temporary housing and a luxury apartment. But here's the part she didn't know. For the past year, I've been working on a tech startup with my best friend, Colin. We've been developing an app in secret, working nights and weekends. Three days after Cassandra left for her cruise, we got acquired. The deal closed fast. My share, $2.3 million. I had one week before Cassandra returned. I worked like a machine. Hired movers, packed my things, set up my new place in Seattle. I sold my old sedan and treated myself to something I'd always wanted. A midnight blue Bentley Continental GT. It arrived the day before Cassandra was supposed to get back. Here's where it gets interesting. Our house had a two car garage, but Cassandra always parked in the driveway she claimed she couldn't be bothered with the garage door opener. That driveway spot was her territory. So I parked the Bentley right there, perfectly centered in her Precious spot. I took one last walk through our house. Left my wedding ring on the kitchen counter with the divorce papers. Then I drove to my hotel near the airport. My flight to Seattle leaving the next morning. My neighbor Diane called me the next afternoon. She was

You can't live with us anymore. When I packed up and told them I'd stop paying the bills, my dad, at first I thought I misheard. My mom gave this nervous laugh like maybe he was joking. But he just sat there staring at me, waiting for my reaction. The room went silent. My sister Lily froze, her fork halfway to her mouth. She looked at me with wide eyes like she couldn't believe what she just heard. I swallowed the piece of ham I was chewing and put my fork down. What? You heard me? He said, you're no longer welcome here. You need to move out. I just sat there trying to process. I'm 23, have a steady job, could have moved out years ago, but I stayed because they needed me. I, I paid the electric Bill, the internet, groceries most weeks, things they couldn't afford because my dad had been unemployed for years and my mom only worked part time. I wasn't a burden. I was the reason the lights were still on in that house. And now, out of nowhere, I was being kicked out like some useless freeloader. Mom finally spoke up. Maybe we should talk about this later. But dad interrupted. No, Ed, this is my house. I make the rules. And I say, he's done here. Lily put down her fork. She was only 16, and I could tell she was scared. She stared. At our parents like she didn't even recognize them. If they could throw me out so easily, what did that mean for her? I took a deep breath. I wasn't going to argue or beg. If they wanted me out, fine. But they weren't ready for what that really meant. I leaned back in my chair. All right, I said. My dad sat up straighter like he'd won some imaginary battle. My mom still looked uncomfortable, but she didn't say anything. Maybe she was in shock or maybe she, I just didn't care as much as I thought. I stood up, grabbed my plate and carried it to the sink. I didn't want to give them the reaction they wanted. Instead, I looked at Lily, who was still sitting there, tense and confused. I gave her a small nod. She was the only one at that table I still cared about. Dad took a sip of his drink like nothing had happened. Mom went back to picking at her mashed potato. Lilly kept looking at me like she wanted to say something, but she didn't. I didn't stay to finish dinner, just walked out. I went straight to my room, closed the door and started packing. I wasn't going to waste time trying to understand why they were doing this. If they wanted me gone, I was gone. But that also meant they'd lose everything I've been paying for, and I wasn't going to warn them. I packed in silence. But I could hear them talking downstairs. My mom's voice was low and scared. My dad's was firm, like he was trying to convince her of something. I caught bits and pieces. He's old enough. We can handle it. He should have moved out years ago. An hour later, there was a knock on my door. I opened it and Lily slipped inside, quickly shutting the door behind her. Her eyes were red and puffy. She'd been crying. Are you really leaving? She whispered. Yeah. I said, I don't have much choice. Can I come with you? That broke my heart. You're 16, they'd call the cops. But the second you turn 18, my door's open. She hugged me tight. I hate them for that. Don't, I said. Just remember who was here for you. I left that night. Didn't say goodbye to them, just grabbed my stuff and drove to a friend's place.

I smiled. Two days later, she was homeless just like him. Mom called me panicking. My sister's voice cut through the Sunday morning quiet. You need to kick Sophie out. I looked up for my coffee, kitchen table, sunlight streaming through the window, smell of bacon still in the air. What? Rachel leaned against the counter, arms crossed. Sophie's 19. She should get her own place. Derek needs to move in here. I blinked. Derek, your boyfriend of three months? Yes. He needs somewhere to stay. So does my daughter. She's an adult now. Time to grow up. Sophie was upstairs. My daughter, sophomore in college, living at home to save money. This is my house. Rachel, actually, she smiled. It's mom's house and I already talked to her. She agrees. My blood went cold. The house was in Mom's name. She bought it 20 years ago. Let me live here after my divorce. I've been paying rent to her for 15 years, but the deed was still hers. Mom said you'd kick out Sophie. She said, family helps family. Derek's practically family now. I gripped my coffee mug. He's homeless because he got evicted for not paying rent. He had a rough patch. 34 and works part time at a gas station. Her face went red. You're so judgmental. This is why you're divorced. I stayed quiet. Fine. I said, let Me talk to mom. Rachel smiled. Victory in her eyes. She's expecting your call. I called mom that afternoon. Did you you tell Rachel I'd kick out Sophie? Pause. Rachel mentioned Derek needs help and Sophie is an adult. I'm paying you $1,800 a month to live here. NP. I know, honey, but Rachel's struggling. My jaw clenched. So you want me to kick out your granddaughter for Rachel's boyfriend? Don't be dramatic. Sophie can find an apartment with what money? She's in college. You'll figure it out. You always do. I hung up. Open my laptop. 15 years of rent payments, $1,800 a month every month, never late. $324,000 for a house she bought for $180,000. I called my lawyer. I've been paying rent for 15 years. No lease. Can I be evicted all without a lease? Yes. I can give you 30 day notice. Oh, what if I've been paying above market rate? Market rate is $1,200. I've been paying $1,800. Silence. For 15 years. Yes. Plus I renovated the kitchen, replace the roof, new HVAC, all out of pocket. Send me receipts now. I did. Rachel called the next morning, smug. Mom's giving you 30 days. Better start packing. Okay. That's it. Okay. I smiled. She couldn't see it. Thank you, Rachel. She hung up. Satisfied. My lawyer called back. Your mother took out a second mortgage eight years ago. She owes $95,000. Three months behind foreclosure.

But at family dinner, she said, you don't help enough. Don't be a cheapskate. My parents took her side and said it was true. For five years, I paid my sister Hannah's rent every single week, $650 transferred without fail. Her husband, Ryan, hasn't worked in those five years, not one day. He always has excuses about the job market or his vision for starting businesses that never materialize. Hannah stopped working after their second kid was born. I get it. Kids are expensive and demand. But instead of being grateful, she started making comments, little jabs about how I was lucky to have a stable job, how my wife and I were spoiled because we bought a new car. Still, I kept sending money, rent, car repairs, medical bills, baby formula. Whatever they needed, I covered it. My wife wasn't thrilled about it, but she trusted me to help my family. Then came that Saturday dinner at our parents'house. Everything seemed normal. Mom made her famous roast chicken. Dad had the game on low. Kids were running around. We were halfway through dessert when Hannah sat down her fork and looked directly at me. You're not helping enough. Don't be stingy. I thought she was joking. I waited for someone to laugh. Nobody did. Then my dad, without even looking up from his plate, said, well, she's not wrong. My mom just nodded in agreement. Something inside me went completely quiet. I looked At these people I'd spent five years supporting financially, emotionally, they looked back at me like I was the problem. I stood up, smiled and said, then live without my money. My wife didn't say a word. She just grabbed our kids jackets and followed me out. The entire drive home, I was silent. But I wasn't thinking about what they. I was thinking about what I was going to do. The moment I got home, I opened my banking app. I cancelled the weekly automatic transfer to Hannah. Then I called their landlord and told him I would no longer be covering their rent. I removed them from the shared grocery account they've been using like it was their own personal fund. Everything gone. In 20 minutes, I dismantled five years of financial support. The next morning at 7:00am, someone started pounding on my front door. I looked through the people.

I was sitting at a bar at night when a woman I'd never seen before walked up to me, grabbed my face, and kissed me. Not a peck, a full kiss that lasted three seconds and tasted like wine and desperation. She pulled back her hand, still on my shoulders, and looked me directly in the eyes. I'm so sorry, she whispered. I need you to play along, please. Before I could ask what the hell was happening, she turned around and smiled at a couple who just walked up behind her. Mom, dad, this is my boyfriend, the one I've been telling you about. Her mother was a stern looking woman in a blazer who looked me up and down like she was calculating my net worth. Her father was tall and broad shouldered, wearing an expression that said he was ready to interrogate me about my intentions. I should have told them this was clearly a mistake. Instead, I heard myself say, nice to finally meet you both. She's told me so much about you. The woman's grip on my shoulder tightened in what I assumed was gratitude. Her mother's expression didn't change. Interesting. She hasn't told us anything about you. Not your name, not what you do, not how you met. Nothing. That's because I wanted it to be a surprise, the woman said quickly. I knew you'd be in town this week, and I wanted you to meet him in person, rather than just hearing about him over the phone. Her father crossed his arms. And your name is? I looked at the woman with. I hadn't discussed a single detail of this fake relationship, and now I was supposed to have a name that matched whatever story she'd invented. Andrew, I said, picking the first name that came to mind. Andrew Fletcher. And what do you do, Andrew? Her mother asked. I'm in software development. Web applications, mostly. That part was actually true. The woman seemed to relax slightly. How did you two meet? Her father asked. The woman jumped in before I could answer. At a coffee shop three months ago. I spilled my latte all over his laptop and felt terrible, so I insisted on buying him a new drink. We got to talking, and she trailed off, looking at me to finish, and I asked for her number before she could leave. I continue. Best coffee shop accident of my life. Her mother's expression softened slightly, which I took as a good sign. Her father still looked skeptical. Three months, he said. That's not very long. Long enough to know she's special, I said, and the woman squeezed my shoulder again. We. We're improvising a relationship in real time and somehow not completely failing. Her mother checked her watch. We have dinner reservations in 20 minutes. I assume you'll be joining us, Andrew? My beer was still half full. On the bar behind me. I've been planning to finish it, go home and watch basketball. Now. I was apparently going to dinner with strangers while pretending to date someone whose name I didn't even know. I'd love to, I said. The woman finally released my shoulder and took my hand instead, interlacing our fingers like we've done this 1,000 sometimes. We followed her parents out of the bar and onto the street. The moment we were a few steps behind them, she leaned close and whispered, thank you. I'll explain everything, I promise. And I'm Sophia, by the way. Andrew. But you already know that because I just made it up in front of your parents. She let out a small, slightly hysterical laugh. I'm so sorry. I panicked. They showed up three days early, and I wasn't prepared. And they kept asking about my boyfriend, and I didn't know what to do. So you grabbed a random stranger at a bar? You were the closest person who looked reasonably datable. I didn't have time to be picky. Reasonably dateable. I'll put that on my dating profile. She squeezed my hand. I owe you everything. Dinner is on me. And after tonight, you never have to see me again. We arrived at an Italian restaurant three blocks away. The hostess seated us at a table near the window, and I found myself sitting across from Sophia's parents while trying to remember every detail of the fake relationship. We just Invented three months. Coffee shop spilled latte. Her name was Sophia. My name was Andrew, which was actually my real name, so at least I wouldn't forget that part. The waiter came and took drink orders. Sophia's father ordered Scotch. Her mother ordered white wine. Sophia ordered red wine and looked like she wanted to drink the entire bottle. I ordered another beer and tried to look relaxed. So, Andrew, Sophia's mother, began once the waiter left. Tell us about yourself. Where did you grow up? Illinois. Small town outside Chicago. Moved here for college and stayed for work. All true. I was accidentally being honest, which made the lying easier. And your family? Parents are still in Illinois. One sister, younger. She's a teacher. Also true. This was the easiest fake relationship I'd ever been in. Do you see them often? Sophia's father asked. Few times a year. Holidays, mostly. We video call regularly, though. Sophia was watching me with an expression I couldn't read. Like she was learning about the person she was supposed

Three years later, he's losing it. Seeing me happy with my successful business and my soulmate Jason dumped me after his family decided I wasn't good enough for their precious bloodline. Nine years together and I got replaced by Victoria, daughter of his dad's business partner, old money, Ivy League degree, spoke three languages, had connections in every major city. Everything I apparently wasn't to break up speech was Caroline, you know I love you. But my family has concerns about long term compatibility after nine years after I moved across the country for his job, helped his sister get into college and every holiday with his family like I was already one of them. His mother called it incompatibility. I called it what it really was. I didn't come from the right tax bracket. They were engaged within six months. I watched their announcement on Instagram while eating ice cream straight on the container at 2:00am. The comments were full of people I thought were my friends congratulating them, saying they were perfect together. The erasure was systematic. His mother, who used to call me her second daughter, blocked my number. His sister, who I'd mentored through her teenage years acted like I was a stranger when we ran into each other at target. 9 years of my life deleted like a spam email. My friends back home begged me to leave the city, but Something stubborn in me refused to run. Instead, I got angry. That little hobby Jason always dismissed. My sustain well fashion side hustle he called playing dress up became my lifestyle. His mother once asked at dinner when I'd focus on my real career instead of wasting time on vintage clothes. I remembered that comment every single day. I threw everything into it. 16 hour days learning supply chains, connecting with local artisans, building relationships with sustainable fabric suppliers. I reinvested every penny, lived off ramen, turned my spare bedroom into a workspace. A marketing background finally paid off. I built a brand story that resonated. The sustainable fashion wave hit and I caught it. Within a year, I went from a few hundred dollars a month to five figures. By year two, I quit my day job. Then a major fashion blogger featured me as an emerging sustainable brand to watch. Orders exploded overnight. I hired employees.

I'm in love with Haley, his step sister. Everyone just sat there frozen. They walked out together while I stood there in my dress feeling like I couldn't breathe. But that wasn't even the worst part. I had to call 70 guests myself, explaining why the wedding was off. The next day, they posted photos together online like it was some great love story. Our friends actually took their side. I found out they've been sneaking around for months behind my back while I was picking wedding flowers. They were meeting in secret. I felt so stupid I packed up everything and left her law school where I basically lived in the library. No friends, no dating, just textbooks and this burning anger that kept me going. I specialized in family law. I wanted to understand exactly what makes someone an unfit parent and how to prove it in court. First year, I was sleeping four hours a night. Second year, I was top of my class. Third year, three different firms were fighting to hire me. Meanwhile, Ryan and Haley had a baby and their lives were falling apart. Their parents completely cut them off. They went from posting fancy dinner photos to selling their furniture on Facebook, lost their apartment and had to move in with roommates. Both working minimum wage at the best firm and became their star researcher. 1, 17 custody cases. My first Year never thought I'd see them again until my boss called me in one morning about a new client. He told me the client specifically asked for our firm. I walked into the conference room ready to meet this new client. There was this exhausted looking man in a wrinkled shirt facing away from me. When he turned around, my whole body went cold. It was Ryan, but he didn't recognize me at all. I'd lost 30 pounds, wore expensive suits, now had completely different hair. He just started rambling about his case. My ex is trying to take my daughter. She left me for someone else and now says I'm unfit. He kept talking while I took notes, trying to keep my hands steady. He explained how Haley met some rich dentist at her gym and wanted full custody of their daughter. She was claiming Ryan had manipulated her into their relationship. The dentist was funding her lawyers while Ryan could barely afford our consultation. Then he looked up from his hands and really saw me for the first time. His whole face went white. He said, oh, my god, no, this can't be happening. He started to leave but stopped at the door. My daughter needs the best. That's you, isn't it? I nodded. He sat back down. I spent two weeks building Ryan's case like my entire career depended on it. I found daycare records proving he did every pickup, doctor visits he attended alone while Haley Was posting gym selfies. Court day came and Haley walked in wearing a designer dress and heels. Holding the dentist's hand and actually laughing about something. Then she saw me sitting at Ryan's table organizing evidence. Her smile completely vanished. She grabbed her lawyer frantically, but there was nothing she could do. The judge had already started. For the first hour, Haley's lawyer painted Ryan as controlling and manipulative. He claimed Ryan forced her into an inappropriate relationship. Then we presented our evidence, 60 pages of proof. The daycare teacher testified that Ryan knew everything about his daughter, including her favorite toy, her allergies, her exact bedtime routine. Haley didn't even know her dog.

She was extra happy that night, holding my hand and dancing as we walked back to the car. Tonight was the night I was gonna do it. And as I watched her dance down the sidewalk, I thought someone behind us just had really bright headlights. But when I turned around, they were getting bigger. I saw the truck coming towards us and without thinking, I tried to get her out of the way. She screamed, but before I could push her, the truck hit both of us. Everything was slow motion, but I tried to shield her with my own body as best as I could. It hit us hard and I felt like my world was being ripped from me. I, I don't even remember how I landed 20 feet away, but the adrenaline was so insane, I stood up and didn't even notice my leg was broken until I tried to get to her. I just hobbled towards her and found her barely still breathing on the ground. She looked at me and tried to say something. He didn't have any air in her lungs, but reached up to hold my face before I lost consciousness. I woke up on the hospital bed and instantly noticed how much medication I was under, but none of that mattered. My first and only thought was my girl. I had to know if She was okay, nurse, nurse, where's my girlfriend? Please tell me she's okay. But the nurse's face told me nothing and everything at once. She's alive, she said, but the way she said it made a live sound like barely. She told me my leg was shattered in three places, that I was lucky, but all I cared about was her. When they finally let me crutch to her hallway, her doctor stopped me outside her room. Through the small window, I could see her mom crying her eyes out. And I started silent, praying she was okay. I tried to go inside, but he put his hand on my shoulder and gave me a look and I knew it wasn't a good one. I asked the doctor to just tell me what was going on. And he made me promise to stay calm because her family was in there already stressed, I promised. And he told me she isn't recognizing anyone. She doesn't know who her mother is. What? Why wouldn't she know her mom? She's experiencing severe amnesia. She doesn't remember anything from the past several years. I couldn't believe it. But that's temporary, right? The memories come back. They always come back. His silence was, it's deafening sometimes. He finally said, it's hard to say. I watched her mother crying and understood now her own daughter didn't know who she was anymore. I just took a deep breath and pushed open the door, ready for anything. I Turned the corner and saw my girl. She was propped up in the hospital bed, a bandage wrapped around her head, her left arm in a cast. Even though she was in the roughest state I've ever seen her in, she was still the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. I was so happy she was okay. And I crunched over to the side of her bed. She was on even stronger meds than me. But when she looked at me, I could tell she was confused. She goes, hi. I gave her a smile, but I could tell by the way she was looking at me that she didn't know who I was. Her body survived, but I was terrified that the girl I fell in love with wasn't with me anymore. I felt tears in my eyes. But before it got too bad, she says, you're funny looking, but you're cute. Why are you crying? I didn't know what to say. This is probably weird to say, but you're actually really cute. I couldn't help it. I laughed. Even with no memory of us, she was still her. You think I'm cute, I asked. Tears streaming down my face but smiling through them. Yeah, I think I like you. She was definitely still her. And then I couldn't help myself. I knew she was still there. So without thinking, I just kissed her. And as soon as I did, her jaw literally dropped. In her dazed state, she Couldn't believe what had just happened and start saying, he kissed me. The cute guy just kissed me. I kissed her again and she started blushing and I knew I was falling for her all over again. She had to relearn how to do pretty much everything. But although her memory never came back, before that day, we fell in love again. Now I'm planning to propose for the second time.

Said I was tearing the family apart over ancient history, over misunderstandings, over jealousy. Chloe was invited.

My boyfriend thinks I'm raising a spoiled brat because of it. I'm 34 and live with my 44 year old boyfriend and my son Jordan. My boyfriend isn't Jordan's dad, just to be clear. So here's the thing. Maybe once or twice a month, Jordan asks if he can make his own dinner. Not because he hates what I'm cooking, but because he wants to try cooking something himself. Like last week, I was making chicken with this garlic herb seasoning I always use, and Jordan asked if he could take a piece and cook it with this spicy rub he saw on some cooking video. I said, sure, go for it. He's 12. He knows how to use the stove safely. I'm right there in the kitchen. Anyway, my boyfriend lost it. He started going off about how I let Jordan do whatever he wants and that kids should just eat what's made for them. I tried explaining that it's not like Jordan does this every night. It's literally twice a month, if that. And the rest of the time, he eats whatever I make without complaining, even when I burn the rice or overcook the pasta. But my boyfriend won't hear it. He just keeps repeating that I'm too soft and that Jordan needs discipline. Then there's breakfast. Every single morning before school, Jordan makes himself two eggs, a piece of toast, and caramelized onions. Yeah, Onions. He's been on this weird onion kick for like three months now. He chops them up, throws them in a pan with a little butter, and cooks them until they're all brown and sweet. Then he puts them on top of his eggs. Honestly, it smells pretty good, and it's better than him asking me to make breakfast when I'm barely awake. But my boyfriend hates this too. He says it's weird that a kid is cooking every morning and that I should be making Jordan's breakfast like a normal parent. I told him Jordan likes doing it and that it's teaching him to be independent. Plus, I'm not a morning person. I can barely pour myself coffee before 7 a. M, let alone cook a full breakfast. My boyfriend just rolls his eyes and mutters something about me being lazy. Last Tuesday it all blew up. I was making spaghetti for dinner and Jordan asked if he could make himself some chicken Alfredo instead because he had leftover chicken from the night before. I said fine. I gave him the pasta, some cream, and the chicken, and he went to work. My boyfriend walked into the kitchen, saw Jordan at the stove, and completely freaked out. He said I was turning Jordan into a spoiled kid and who thinks he's too good for family meals. I snapped back that Jordan wasn't being spoiled, he was just cooking. My boyfriend then said that if I keep letting Jordan do Whatever he wants. He's going to grow up thinking the world revolves around him. I asked him what the big deal was. Jordan's not demanding I cook separate meals for him. He's literally doing it himself. He's not wasting food, he's not making a mess. He cleans up after himself every time. My boyfriend said, that's not the point. The point is that kids need structure and rules, and letting Jordan cook whenever he feels like it is teaching him that rules don't apply to him. I told him he was overreacting. Jordan's a good kid. He does his homework without being asked, keeps his room clean, he helps with chores. Letting him cook his own food sometimes isn't going to ruin him. My boyfriend said I was making excuses and that I clearly don't know how to parent because I'm too worried about being Jordan's friend instead of his mom. That one stung. I told him he didn't get to tell me how to raise my kid, especially since he's not Jordan's father. He said that as long as he's living in this house and paying half the bills, he gets a say. I told him that paying bills doesn't make him Jordan's parent. He stormed out of the kitchen and didn't talk to me for the rest of the night. The next morning, Jordan was making his usual breakfast eggs, toast, onions. My boyfriend came into the kitchen, looked at Jordan, and said, you know, most kids, your Age, just eat cereal. Jordan looked at him and said, I don't like cereal. My boyfriend said, well, maybe you should learn to like it. Then he walked out. Jordan looked at me like he didn't know what he did wrong. I told him he didn't do anything wrong and to keep cooking.

When my daughter was 16, she got rear ended by a drunk driver while stopped at a red light. The guy was clearly wasted, failed three sobriety tests. But somehow his expensive lawyer was trying to blame my daughter for the accident. The crash left her with a concussion and whiplash. She missed two weeks of school and had to quit her job at the local coffee shop because she couldn't handle the physical demands anymore. But this lawyer was determined to prove she was somehow at fault. During the deposition, he kept asking the same questions over and over, trying to confuse her or get her to contradict herself. My daughter has always been sharp, but head injuries can affect your memory. So I was worried about how she'd handle his aggressive tactics. The lawyer starts with this condescending tone. Now, Miss Johnson, you claim you were completely stopped at the intersection, correct? Yes, sir. The light was red. But how can you be absolutely certain you were stopped? Isn't it possible you were still slowing down? Because my car has something called brakes, and I use them. The stenographer smiled, but the lawyer wasn't amused. He kept pushing. You were on your phone at the time of the accident, weren't you? No, I wasn't. Come now, you're a teenager. All teenagers are on their phones constantly. Surely you were texting someone. I wasn't on my phone. I find that very Hard to believe. What teenager isn't on their phone while driving? That's when my daughter looked him dead in the eye and said, the kind whose parents actually taught her how to drive responsibly. Maybe if more adults acted like adults instead of getting drunk and driving into teenager, we wouldn't need to have these conversations. The room went completely silent. The lawyer's face turned red, but he kept going. Let's talk about your alleged injuries. Concussions are very convenient because they're impossible to prove, aren't they? Actually, they showed up on my CT scan. But I'm not a doctor. Are you? I'm asking the questions here, young lady. Right, but you just asked me if concussions are impossible to prove. And I'm telling you mine was proven by medical imaging. So either you don't understand how CT scans work, or you're asking questions you already know the answers to just to waste everyone's time. Our lawyer was trying not to smile. The other guy was getting flustered. Miss John, isn't it true that you've been milking these so called injuries for attention and to get out of school? Yes, because nothing says fun teenage experience like massive headaches, memory problems, and having to quit the job I loved. I definitely gave myself a concussion just to miss my AP chemistry test. The sarcasm was thick, and even the court reporter was stifling a laugh. But the lawyer wasn't done. He pulled out a photo on his phone and showed This is a picture from your Instagram account posted three days after the accident. You're smiling. If you were really injured, would you be posting happy photos? My daughter looked at the photo, then back at him with this completely deadpan expression.

My husband Eric had always been a jokester, and it's one of the things I fell in love with. But over the years, the jokes became meaner. He started calling me his old ball and chain. When his buddies were around, he pat my stomach and say, expand ending again this year, or tell his co workers how some people age like fine wine and how, unfortunately, I was aging like cheese. They'd laugh, but their faces would always look just as uncomfortable as mine. Then last week, during my birthday dinner with his parents, Eric raised his glass and stood up to toast me. To my beautiful wife, he said, and for a second my heart lifted. Then he grinned and added, my adorably ugly old lady. Happy birthday! Here's to another year. Only a few more until I get to collect that life insurance policy, right? Everyone at the table laughed nervously. I felt my heart sink in disappointment. You know, your joke really went too far this time, I told him in the car later. Actually, all of your jokes lately have been nothing but mean, and I don't appreciate it. I thought back to yours as I explained how much his words hurt, how every joke chipped away at my confidence, how I didn't recognize myself anymore because I'd started to believe the things he said about Me? He pulled up on the side of the road and stared at me for a long moment before saying, babe, are you serious? You're being dramatic over nothing. It was just light teasing. You know me. But I've also been telling you for weeks how much I didn't like your jokes, I said quietly. Well, it's not like they're lies. You are getting older, and it doesn't help that you've been letting yourself go ever since we had kids. Can't you just do what most people do and let it go in one ear and out the other? He suggested. That's when I realized he'd never understand. Not unless he felt it himself. The next morning, I opened up about the situation to our family and friends. His sister stayed quiet for a long time before admitting, I've been watching him do this to you for years. You deserve better, and we'll help him see that. She started it off casually the next time she met with my husband. Hey, Eric, I noticed your hair has been thinning. Don't worry, bald is attractive on some people, she said. I watched Eric touch his head, forcing his smile. Then during his golf game, Eric's best friend called him his little punching bag, mentioning how hard it was constantly.

My wife, Naomi, and her best friend Jen have been inseparable since college, 20 years of friendship. I've always dealt with it because Naomi's happy. But three months ago, something shifted. Naomi started saying things that didn't sound like her. Maybe we should wait on kids until we're more financially stable. We have $85,000 saved. I think you work too much. I work 9 to 5. My parents mentioned you're not very ambitious. Her parents love me. Every single new opinion came within 24 hours of Jen visiting our house. I noticed Jen started coming over three times a week instead of her usual once a month. She'd stay for hours and every time she left, Naomi would bring up something new to criticize about our life together. Two weeks ago, Naomi suddenly wanted to move to a bigger house. We bought our place two years ago. When I asked why, she said Jen's house has four bedrooms and a pool. We don't even have kids yet. Last Tuesday, I came home early from a cancelled meeting. I heard voices in the kitchen. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but I heard my name. Jen's voice carried through the hallway. You know he's never going to make partner at that firm, right? My husband made partner at 32. Yours is 35 and still an associate. Naomi laughed awkwardly. He's doing fine. We're comfortable. Jen wasn't done. Comfortable isn't The same as successful. I'm just saying if you want the life you actually deserve, maybe this isn't it. Look at my cousin Josie. She divorced her husband last year and now she's engaged to a surgeon. She's so much happier. I stood frozen in our hallway. This woman was actively trying to convince my wife to leave me. I don't know, Naomi said quietly. Things have been feeling off lately because you're finally seeing clearly. Jen replied, I've been waiting for you to realize it. I walked into the kitchen. Jen didn't even flinch, just smiled at me like we've been discussing the weather. Hey, we were just talking about you. I looked at Naomi. She couldn't meet my eyes. Jen grabbed her purse. Well, I should get going, Naomi. Think about what I said. Okay. She hugged Naomi and walked out. Naomi immediately went upstairs without saying a word to me. That night, Naomi brought up separation. She sat on the edge of our bed and used the exact same phrases Jen had used that afternoon. I think we want different things. I need to figure out what I actually want. Maybe we rushed into this. We dated for six years before getting married. We've been married for three. I asked her Point Blank, is this what you want or what Jen wants? Naomi's face crumbled. She started crying. Mess Sarah ran down her cheeks, but she couldn't answer the question. I pressed harder because three months ago, you Were talking about baby names. Three months ago, you loved our house. Three months ago you told me I was your best friend. What changed? I don't know, she whispered. I just feel confused. When did you start feeling confused? Before or after Jen started coming over all the time. She looked at me like I'd slap. Don't blame Jen for this. She's trying to help me. Help you do what exactly? I asked leave me. She got defensive, accused me of being controlling, said I was trying to isolate her from her friends, said I'd never understood her relationship with. Then she grabbed a pillow and locked herself in our bedroom. I slept in the guest room that night, stared at the ceiling until 3:00am the next morning. I checked our phone Bill online. Jen had called Naomi. Naomi 47 times in the past three weeks. Naomi called her back 52 times. They were talking for hours, sometimes past midnight. I felt sick. Yesterday, Naomi's mom called me. She was crying. She said Naomi told her we're having problems and she doesn't understand why. Her mom said Naomi seems like a completely different person lately. She won't even come to Sunday dinners anymore.

You need to stop being so friendly with my friends. What are you talking about? I asked. She spun around, and I could see she'd been working up to this all night. You drove Carla home last week. You spent three hours helping Heather with her resume. You fixed Nicole's laptop. Her voice kept getting sharper with each example. They're your friends. I'm being helpful. She actually laughed at me. Not a real laugh, but that bitter kind. That meant I was in trouble. Helpful. My ex was helpful, too. Then I caught him in bed with my roommate. So that's what this was about. So you think I'm going to sleep with your friends? She crossed her arms, and I knew I'd already lost this fight. I'm not stupid. I see how they look at you, how they always need something fixed when I'm not home. From now on, you keep your distance. No more favor, no more long conversations. Treat them like strangers. Fine. If that's what she wanted, that's what she'd get. Carla's car died in our driveway. First she knocked on our door holding jumper cables with this hopeful look on her face. I look did her through the door window, made eye contact, then walked away. She knocked harder, and her face went from confused to hurt. Melissa had to go outside and jump the car herself. While I sat on the couch, I could hear Carla asking what was wrong with Me and Melissa making up some excuse about me being busy. The guilt hit me, but I pushed it down. Then Heather texted about a job interview in my field. She needed quick advice about technical questions. I screenshotted it and sent it to Melissa with your friend needs something as the message. Melissa spent two hours on the phone pretending to understand software development while I watch TV. She kept shooting me these desperate looks, but I just shrugged. The escalation really started at game night. Nicole's laptop ash with her presentation for work still open. She was near tears, and everyone could see it. Can you please look at it just this once? She begged. Everyone waited for me to help like I always did. Sorry, can't help, I said, and went back to my cards. Nicole left early, in full pan mode about her morning meeting. Gina pulled Melissa aside. What's wrong with him? He always helps. Melissa's excuses were getting weaker. At Melissa's birthday party, things got ugly. Her friend Amanda needed help carrying in this massive cake. I threw out my back, she explained while struggling with the box. I stayed in my chair. Hope you feel better, I said, and turned back to my conversation. Three women had to help Amanda while the entire room went silent. Melissa's mom asked if we were having problems, and I could hear the concern in her voice. The breaking point was Gina's engagement party. During group photos, I stepped out every time Melissa's friends were in the shot. I'll take the picture, I kept saying. When they insisted I join. I suddenly needed the bathroom. By the fifth photo, Gina was actually crying. Does he hate us? She asked Melissa, loud enough for everyone to hear. Melissa tried explaining I was camera shy, but everyone knew that was garbage.

And last Sunday at her 80th birthday party, she said it in front of everyone, 40 relatives watching while she cut her cake and announced, I love all my grandchildren, but Nathan here, I could never trust him with anything important. My cousins laughed. My aunt whispered something to my uncle. My mom just stared at her plate. Grandma pointed her cake knife at me. He's always been different, secretive, won't tell us what he really does for work. I'm a software engineer, I said quietly. That's what you say, she replied, but you work from home in your pajamas. That's not a real job. My cousin Brandon jumped in. Grandma's right. Real men go to an office. Nathan just plays on his computer all day. The whole room nodded. My sister tried to defend me, but grandma cut her off. And he never visits, never calls, just shows up when there's free food. She looked around for agreement. I'm changing my will next week. People who care about family should be rewarded, not people like Nathan. My uncle stood up. Mom's right, Nathan. You've been coasting your whole life. The rest of us work hard, my aunt added. My son's a doctor. Brandon's in finance. What do you even contribute? I felt everyone staring, waiting for me to defend myself. I didn't say anything. Grandma kept going, when I die, I'm splitting. Everything between people who showed up. Brandon visits every week. He'll get the house, she pointed at me. You'll get nothing. Brandon smirked. Thanks, grandma. My mom finally spoke up. Mom, that's not fair. Nathan's busy with work. Busy. Grandma interrupted. Doing what? Sitting at home. She turned back to the party. Everyone here works real jobs. Brandon's closing million dollar deals. My other grandson saving lives. And Nathan. He laughed. Nathan sits in his apartment doing who knows what. My aunt nodded. It's embarrassing, honestly, when people ask what my nephew does, what am I supposed to say? Say he's unemployed? My uncle said, just it. That's basically what it is. Brandon raised his wine glass to grandma for finally telling it like it is. Half the room clinked glasses. The other half just stared at me with pity. Grandma sat back down, satisfied. I've said my piece. Now let's enjoy the party. The doorbell rang. My sister went to answer it. She came back looking confused. Nathan, there's someone here for you.

At 3:00am, I taken away her weekend sleepover privileges and she lost it. I hate you. Amber loves me more than you ever will. She's a better mom and you're just jealous because dad picked her instead of you. She stood in my kitchen, my mother's kitchen table between us, telling me how Amber never made her do chores. Amber bought her the designer jeans I said were too expensive. Amber let her stay up until midnight on school nights. Amber said grades didn't define her worth. Amber understood her. I was just a bitter woman who couldn't get over the divorce. That night she called her father crying, saying I was being abusive by taking away her phone. By morning, my ex husband Rick was at my door with custody modification papers. Amber stood behind him in her yoga pants and fresh manicure, rubbing his back while he accused me of emotional abuse. Lily had already packed her bags. She walked past me laughing, actually laughing, saying she couldn't wait to never deal with my rules again. I signed the papers that week. What else could I do? Force the teenager Who hated me to stay. The first month without Lily was the hardest, then the easiest. No more screaming matches about homework. No more attitude when I asked her to put her plate in the dishwasher. No more lying about where she was going. No more finding empty vodka bottles in her closet that Amber had apparently bought for her because teens will drink anyway. I started taking pottery classes on Tuesday nights when I used to drive her to dance. I turned her room into a home office and actually got promoted at work because I could focus without the constant drama. I joined a book club, started running again, lost 15 pounds, slept through the night without wondering what trouble she was getting into. My friends said I looked 10 years younger. Rick never texted me updates about Lily. Neither did she. I heard from other parents that she was posting constantly about her amazing new life, shopping.

The grocery store security footage showed my face hitting the floor. Blood pooled around my head where I cracked it on the tile. When I woke up in the hospital, I immediately threw up blood. You're literally starving to death, the doctor told me. I tried to sit up, but the room spun violently. I need to get back to work. Rent is due tomorrow. She pushed me back down. You're 16 years old and you weigh 80 pounds. Can't be right. When did you last eat a meal? Three days ago, I think. She looked horrified. Where are your parents right now? In the basement, playing their online game, like always. They don't know you're dying? They told me not to bother them unless someone is dead. You almost were dead. Almost doesn't count according to them. She glanced at my chart. You work two jobs and go to school. I work at 4 in the morning delivering newspapers, then I go to school. Then I work at the grocery store until midnight. That it's physically impossible. Red Bull and gas station pills make it possible. You're taking stimulant. I have to pay rent or we get evicted. Your parents don't have jobs? They quit two years ago to become professional gamers. Are they making money from gaming? I laughed. They've made exactly zero dollars. But they keep saying fame is coming any day now. How much sleep are you getting? My thoughts kept slipping away like water through my fingers. Three hours on a good night, but usually less. Do you ever feel dizzy or confused? Every single day. But I can push through it. She stared at me in disbelief. Your parents make you work while they stay home gaming all day? They're trying to build their streaming career. They need my support. She examined my arms, which looked like twigs. Your 40 pounds underweight because you're feeding them instead of yourself. You don't understand. They should be able to follow their dreams after the sacrifices they made for me. My manager, Jimmy, had been sitting in the corner listening. He finally spoke up, looking sick with guilt. I should have said something sooner. This kid has been falling apart for months. He has been seeing things at work that aren't real. The doctor turned to him quickly. What kind of things? Yesterday he was having full conversations with nobody for 20 minutes straight. I felt my face get hot. Sometimes when I'm really tired, I see shadows that aren't there. That's your brain literally shutting down from exhaustion. Jimmy looked broken. And last week I found him unconscious in the freezer. He had been in there for 40 minutes and had blue lips. I was just resting my eyes. You could have died. But I didn't, so it's fine. The doctor checked my blood work again. Your body is failing and you're still defending them? They're my parents. I owe them everything. You don't owe them your life. Without me, they'll be homeless. Without them, you'd be healthy. The doctor called Child Protective Services and a social worker arrived within an hour. They tried calling my parents 23 times before anyone answered. The doctor put them on speaker so the social worker could record everything. I could hear battle sounds and screaming from their game in the background. This better be important because you just made us lose a ranked match. The doctor spoke calmly. This is the hospital calling about your son who collapsed at work. What does that lazy piece of garbage want now? He's in critical condition from severe malnutrition. My dad exploded. Of course. I should have just let him die when he was born instead of wasting 16 years feeding him. Everyone in the room froze. Your son is hospitalized with severe exhaustion and malnutrition. The doctor said carefully. That lazy waste of space better not miss his shift tomorrow or we'll all be homeless. My mom grabbed the phone. Next, he has to give us $800 by tomorrow or I'm selling everything he owns. The doctor's voice got ice cold. Your child's organs are failing from working to support you. Stop making excuses for that pathetic failure because he can't handle it.

What? Don't think I had anything to do with this. I called you guys because of the smell. I crossed my arms defensively. The officer's face stayed neutral, but his partner was already walking toward their patrol car. Due to the nature of your relationship to the victim, we're going to have to bring you in for questioning. Relationship to the victim? Who's the victim? My voice cracked with confusion. We're not at liberty to say it at this time. Please come with us. He gestured toward the car. I'd bought this house just three weeks ago. It was supposed to be a fresh start after my divorce. Little two bedroom ranch in a quiet neighborhood where I could rebuild my life. The smell had started a few days after I moved in. At first I thought it was a dead mouse in the walls. Then it got worse, sweet and rotting and impossible to ignore. The officer guided me to the back seat of the patrol car. No handcuffs, but the door locks clicked with finality. Through the window, I watched more police arrived. Crime scene tape went up around my new home. Officers in white hazmat suits carry equipment inside. This was really happening. During the ride to the station, my mind raced through possibilities. The previous owner had been an elderly woman who died in a nursing home. Her family had sold the house quickly. Maybe someone had broken in while it sat empty. Maybe there'd been a murder years ago that nobody knew about. did they think I had a relationship with whoever was in my walls? At the station, they put me in a small interrogation room, grey walls and a metal table with one of those big mirrors everyone knows is one way glass. I sat there for what felt like hours, no phone call, no lawyer, just me and my panic thoughts. Through the door, I could hear muffled voices, officers walking past in the hallway, phones ringing, normal police station sounds that felt surreal given my situation. I'd never been in trouble with the law, never even gotten a speeding ticket. Now I was being questioned about a dead body in my house. Two officers finally entered the room. Detective Harper was older with grey hair and tired eyes. Detective Mcguire looked younger and kept glancing at a file folder. They sat across from me and the older one started a recording device. I wanna be clear that I just bought this house. Whatever's in those walls has nothing to do with me. I said it before they could speak. Harper nodded but didn't look convinced. We'll get to that. First, can you tell us about your family? My family, I'm divorced, no kids. My parents live in Florida. I didn't understand the question. What about siblings, Mcguire asked while taking Notes. My stomach tightened. I had a brother. He went missing 15 years ago. The detectives exchanged a look that made my blood run cold. Harper opened the file folder and pulled out a photo. It was a forensic photo of something wrapped in plastic inside a wall cavity. Didn't make out details, but the shape was obviously human. Your brother was 17 when he disappeared, correct? Harper's voice was gentle but firm. Yes. We filed a missing person report. The police never found anything. My hands were shaking now. And you were living where at the time? Mcguire leaned forward with my parents, about 10 miles from here. My mouth felt dry. They asked more questions about my brother, when I'd last seen him, what he was wearing, if we'd fought before he vanished. Each question felt like a trap, but I answered honestly, Tom, he had been troubled, drugs and bad friends. We'd all assumed he'd run away. After an hour of questions, Harper finally got to the point. The thing is we found some interesting evidence in those walls along with the body. What kind of evidence? I asked, though. I wasn't sure. I wanted to know. DNA evidence, hair, blood, things that help us identify not just the victim, but potentially who put them there. His eyes never left mine. I waited for him to continue. The room felt smaller, the air thicker. Mcguire was still writing notes, but I could feel him watching me, too. Whatever they'd found, it was bad. Bad enough that they'd brought me in immediately, bad enough that they thought I was involved. Harper stood up and walked around the table. He placed another photo in front of me. This one showed a gold class ring covered in dirt and decay. Tommy's high school ring, the one he'd never taken off, the one we'd assumed he was wearing when he disappeared, peared. We're rushing the DNA test, but initial field tests are concerning. Harper's voice dropped lower. Concerning how I managed to ask. He sat on the edge of the table looking down at me. Mcguire had stopped writing. The recorder's red light linked steadily. Ma'am, why is it that we found your son's DNA in your walls? Full story on channel link below.

Mom's eating breakfast scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading Life 3 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep families safe and honest. I'm 17 and work part time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest. She says if we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear. Which sounds like something a dictator would say, but whatever. She makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on, and I realize immediately, really, what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3 60 doesn't just show where you are. It shows your speed when driving, your phone battery, and sends notifications for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect! Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says no, she needs the Car all day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she's shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is. Men lose interest when you mention women things she tell me she doesn't realize she just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom check your location while I'm at school. Dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realize she's literally sitting there refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day 3 mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 in a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit, which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see. Shows up 30 it's late to his job site and loses a client worth $2,000. Week 2 she sees I stopped at McDonald's for three minutes and lectures me about wasting money. Which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for 4 hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and asks her four hours at one store and mom glares at me like I should have warned her he was checking but how can I when she's watching my every move? She Used to text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week 3, she's at a medical plaza until eleven PM. Dad mentions that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps. Women's health is very thorough. But I've been to that clinic. They close at 6. That night, dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical build visits, and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives, marked Final Notice, and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that. And mom says, processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location pins on the map. Week 5, and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the Medical Plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11:00am, and it's now six PM. I tell my manager I'm sick and drive over. Dad's already there in the parking lot, looking at life. 3 60, zoom.

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy Robert looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let. Let me guess. Looking for a rich boyfriend? Smart girl. Lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colors are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interesting perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me, and continued his lecture. A girl like you probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do. Flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was Familiar with the artist's work. Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the pictures doesn't count as being familiar with art, sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes from decades of study, not whatever you Learned from TikTok. Robert decided to test me. Rapid firing questions. Who's Basquiat? What's Kiara Scuro? Name three Renaissance painters besides da Vinci. When I started to answer, he cut me off. Wrong. See, this is why galleries shouldn't have open events. You probably googled some terms before coming here to impress men, but Riley here is working in a tradition you couldn't possibly understand without a proper education. Not community college, sweetie. Real universities. He returned to my painting, now explaining it louder to draw a crowd. What Riley has achieved here would cost probably 100,000 in education to even attempt. The materials alone cost more than you'd make in a month at whatever retail job you have. He looked at my outfit with disgust. Target clearance rack, right? Someone who shops there couldn't possibly grasp the investment in this piece. He probably spent more on one brush than your entire outfit. When I suggested the artist might be self taught, Robert sneered at me. Is that how you Learned about art? Painting parties? Robert grabbed my wrist to pull me to another angle, his grip too tight. You're too stupid to even stand in the right Spot Riley intended for this to be viewed from exactly here. Your ignorance is actually disrespectful to his work. He kept his hand on my wrist while explaining, though. Honestly, explaining this to you is like teaching calculus to a toddler. You lack the basic foundation to understand any of it. He noticed me trying to pull away and

But her face immediately dropped when she realized that we tricked her. My sister in law, Maya, has always been competitive with me since the day I married her brother, James. She couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, she tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me. And from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first, it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd flash, she'd push harder. Come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nursery and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail when she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages desperately searching for any evidence. Of our name decision. My husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use it first. She wouldn't do that, he said, but I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created a interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with Final Decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. When Maya came over for dinner, I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition and I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react. Aurora is such a beautiful name, don't you think, she'd say. Watching our faces carefully, I played along perfectly, acting slightly uncomfortable whenever she mentioned it, like she'd stumbled onto our secret. Two weeks later, Maya went into labor. Within an hour of giving birth, she posted on Facebook, welcome to the world, Baby Aurora Rose. Our little princess has finally arrived. The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction to her Surprise. The next day at the hospital, Maya was practically glowing with smugness when I walked into her room. She actually had the audacity to say, I hope you don't mind that we ended up using Aurora when she was born. It just felt so right for our daughter. I know you guys were considering it, too. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed her our real pic.

Jess came over to my place Friday night, and I could tell something was bothering her by the way she kept sighing. You know what Britney told me today? She said, flopping down on my couch. Her boyfriend is so mysterious, and she's obsessed with him. Meanwhile, you texted me 12 times about being nervous for your presentation. The way she said it made me feel like I was some kind of burden. I wish you were more mysterious, more of a challenge. I should have known this would end badly when three weeks later, she'd be crying at my door. But that night, I just felt hurt and said, fine, I'll be mysterious that night. I usually would have texted her good night, but I didn't, and it felt wrong not doing it. She sent me three question marks right away, and I just wrote back, all good, and left it at that. Saturday morning came, and normally I'd text her about my coffee and ask what she was up to, but I kept my phone in my pocket. By noon, she would texting, you okay? And I just sent a thumbs up, which killed me because I actually wanted to talk to her. Monday was the worst because I got the promotion I've been working for, and all I wanted was to call her and celebrate. When we went to dinner that Night. She asked about my day, and I just said, same old while scrolling through my phone, even though inside I was bursting to tell her. She leaned across the table trying to figure out what was going on with me. You seem different, she said. Good. Different. And the crazy part was she seemed more into me than she had in months. Made me feel powerful, but also completely hollow inside. The second week, she started showing up at my place without calling first and cooking these fancy dinners, basically doing anything to crack me open. I can't figure you out anymore, she said. Wednesday night, and she sounded excited about it. Britney so jealous, she says. I got the mysterious boyfriend. Jackpot! I wanted to tell her how dumb this whole thing was and how much I missed just talking to her normally, but I just shrugged and kept watching TV. my dad called because my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery and he was freaking out. I spent three hours calming him down while Jess sat next to me trying to figure out what was happening. After I hung up, she asked, is everything okay? And I wanted to fall into her arms and tell her everything. Family stuff. I said instead, it's handled. She kissed me harder than she had in months and whispered, you're so strong.

I got a hysterical call at eight PM from Brooklyn's mother screaming that Ariana had attacked everyone in their basement and the police were taking her away in handcuffs. I abandoned my shopping cart at target and sped across town to find three ambulances, two police cars, and dozens of parents standing in Brooklyn's driveway. Ariana was sitting in the back back of a patrol car with her hands cuffed behind her back, while teenagers were being treated for pepper spray exposure on the front lawn. Ariana, what have you done? I asked through the patrol car window, trying to understand why my 13 year old daughter would do something so violent. The other kids were crying and coughing, their eyes swollen shut from this. Brooklyn was sobbing on her mother's shoulder, her makeup running down her cheeks, while she kept asking why her best friend would ruin her birthday. Parents were shouting about pressing charges and lawsuits, while officer Decker explained that Ariana could face multiple counts of assault. Ariana looked straight ahead, her jaw set with that stubborn expression I recognized from when she knew she was right about something. Mom, check the basement window, the one behind the water heater. Please just check it. Her voice was steady, but I could see her hands trembling where they were cuffed behind her. Brooklyn's father was furious when I asked to look. In their basement. Your daughter just assaulted 15 children, including my daughter, at her own birthday party. She planned this, got the pepper spray hidden in her purse. The kids were just dancing when she started screaming for everyone to get down and then sprayed them all. But Officer Decker said I could examine the scene since Ariana was being detained. I went down to the basement where the party had been happening. Pink streamers and balloons were everywhere. The birthday cake sat untouched on a table, and Brooklyn's new speakers were still playing pop music. But when I looked behind the water heater where Ariana had told me to check, my eyes widened. The window lock was broken, twisted metal hanging loose, and there were fresh MUD prints on the carpet underneath that were far too large to belong to any of the kids at the party. When I told Officer Decker, he called for backup immediately and started searching the basement more thoroughly. While he was checking the storage area, Ariana finally explained what had happened from the back of the patrol car. She'd been watching everyone dancing when she note

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together. I've been playing husband since year two. Paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent, while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down. Tears in her eyes, hand on her heart. Then some perfectly rehearsed excuse. We're not ready, let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal number five. And she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time. Convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere, and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it. When she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, sir, surrounded by everyone we knew. And she didn't even let me finish the speech. Just shook her head with this pitying smile like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke. Asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant, and the Mask came completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said, voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place? After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place? Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I'd spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. Didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working. She texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said, I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic Started creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night, acting extra sweet. Made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said, kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

They start making these passive aggressive comments about how I'm alone, like being single is some kind of disease, whatever. I go grab food from the buffet, I come back, and my wine is gone. Completely disappeared. Then this waiter walks over asking to see my wristband. He's all apologetic, saying the family told him I was underage and must have snuck away from my parents. I'm 26 years old. I showed him my ID and explained I paid for this all inclusive package specifically so I could drink without worrying about finding bars. The waiter felt horrible and brought me a fresh glass of wine right as the family came back with their food. The mom's face turned bright red when she saw the new wine glass. He whispered something to her husband, who marched over to the waiter. He starts demanding they check my I D. Again because there's no way someone my age would Be traveling alone. Unless something was wrong with me. The waiter looked confused, but checked my I D. A second time. Then he looked at the dad and said, sir, she's 26, and this is an adult resort.

I already told you I have a boyfriend. The guy behind me in line actually stops mid order to watch this unfold. An elderly couple at table 6 is full on staring. Ma'am, I say, holding up my disaster burger. I literally just need napkins to eat this thing without destroying my shirt. She squints at me. So you're saying you're not trying to get my number right now? I am absolutely not trying to get your number. I'm trying to get napkins. She doesn't believe me. Then why did you come back up here instead of just using what I gave you? I show her the three napkins, already completely soaked through these three napkins absorb less grease than my car's air filter. The manager, a tired looking dude named Kevin, walks over. Everything okay here? Britney immediately goes into victim mode. This guy won't leave me alone. He keeps asking for my number. I turned to Kevin. I asked for napkins twice. Kevin looks at me, then at my obviously messy burger, then at the three destroyed napkins in my hand. Britney, just give him napkins. But Britney's locked in now. Why are you taking his side? He's clearly hitting on me. Kevin sighs because he's holding a burger that looks like it exploded and you gave him three napkins. The guy behind me finally speaks up. Dude, I watched the whole thing. He literally just asked for Napkins. Britney spins around. Oh, so now you're all ganging up on me. The elderly woman at.

So my brother Jake got married like three weeks ago and the whole thing was basically a slap in the face. His wife Megan decided nobody under 21 could come because they were serving alcohol and didn't want any minors getting drunk. I was 19 at the time, which apparently made me some kind of liability. The excuse was complete bullshit and everyone knew it. I don't even drink that much, maybe a beer here and there with friends, but I'm not some alcoholic teenager who's gonna embarrass their precious wedding. But whatever, that's what they decided and my parents just went along with it like always. I asked them to reconsider a few times because honestly, it hurt. Jake and I used to be close growing up. We shared a room until I was 14, played video games together, the whole thing. But ever since he started dating Megan two years ago, he's basically been calling all the shots. She thinks she's better than everyone because her dad owns some car dealership and she went to private school. After they kept saying no, I just stopped caring. If I wasn't good enough for their wedding, then fine, I wasn't gonna beg anymore. Then last Saturday rolls around and Jake texts our family group chat saying he wants everyone to go to some fancy steakhouse to celebrate the wedding. My parents were all Excited, talking about how nice it would be to finally celebrate as a family. But I just replied that I wasn't going. My mom called me right away asking why not. I told her the same thing I told everyone else. I didn't see the point in celebrating something I wasn't even invited to. She tried to guilt trip me saying it would mean a lot to Jake and that my cousins Becca and Tyler were going even though they didn't get invited either. But here's the thing. Becca is 13 and Tyler is 15. Their parents literally forced them to go. They didn't have a choice. I'm 19. I pay my own phone Bill. I work at Best Buy part time and I'm starting community college in the fall. I can make my own decisions about where I spend my Saturday night. My parents kept trying to convince me all week. My dad even offered to pay for my meal, which honestly just made it worse. Like you couldn't fight for me to be at the actual wedding, but now you wanna throw money at me to show up to the Celebration dinner. The night of the dinner, I stayed home and ordered pizza. I was playing call of duty with my friends when my phone started blowing up. First it was Jake texting me asking where I was and Megan sent me this long paragraph about how disappointed she was that I couldn't be mature enough to support my Brother's happiness. The funniest part is they acted all surprised that I didn't show up. I literally told them I wasn't going. What did they expect? After they got home from dinner, Jake came to my room and tried to have some.

Her freelance design business, mom bragged about. I found the real designer she was stealing work from and paying cash under the table. Her anxiety that required constant family support. Text messages showed her laughing about manipulating our parents for money while partying in Vegas. The final piece was a folder labeled Liam College. Inside were my parents notes about how giving me too much attention might damage Madison's self esteem. A literal written plan to diminish me so Madison wouldn't feel bad about herself. I took pictures of everything and created a detailed presentation. The next morning, I called a family meeting about yesterday. I started calmly. I wanna show you something. I connected my laptop to the TV. First slide, the hidden acceptance letters. Mom's face went pale. Where did you find those? Second slide, the drained college fund statements. Dad stood up. Liam, this isn't. Third slide, Madison's fake credentials and stolen design work. Madison's face turned white. You went through my things. Fourth slide, a set of handwritten notes I found in a folder labeled Madison Support. I read the top page aloud. We need to be careful not to overpraise Liam. Too much attention might make things harder for Madison. Focus on her confidence. First, I looked up at them. So my achievements were a threat you needed to manage. The room was dead silent. You sacrificed my entire childhood, I said quietly, so she wouldn't feel bad about being Mediocre. Madison started crying. I didn't know about the college fund, but you knew about everything else, I said. Pulling up her texts, mocking me. You knew exactly what you were doing. Mom tried to speak. I cut her off. I'm leaving. I have a job offer in Seattle. I start Monday. You'll never hear from me again unless you're ready to tell the truth. I walked toward the door. Madison followed me outside, mascara running. Liam, please. I'm sorry. I didn't mean. She collapsed against the wall sobbing. You meant all of it, I said. You just didn't expect consequences. I drove away and didn't look back. Three years later, I'm thriving. They're still calling, but I'm done being invisible so someone else can shine.

Growing up, my sister Brooke never let me forget I was adopted. While our parents showered us both with love, she'd whisper things like, they only got you because the agency had a two for one sale. Or at least I know where I came from. I tried not to let it bother me, but every comment chipped away at my confidence. I was 8 when my parents chose me. They already had Brooke, who was 6 at the time, but they wanted another child. After seeing me at the agency, they said it felt like I was meant to be part of our family. But Brooke never accepted me. She'd hide my homework, blame me for things she broke, and tell other kids at school I was second hand goods. Despite her constant bullying, I worked hard in school while Brooke partied and barely maintained to see average. I was taking advanced classes and studying late into the night. Our parents noticed the difference, but didn't want to compare us. He'd praise both of us equally, even when Brooke clearly didn't deserve it. Everything changed during our senior year. Brooke was failing three classes and risked not graduating. Instead of studying, she spent her time making TikToks about how adopted kids were damaged goods and posting Instagram Stories mocking my generic brand DNA. One day, I overheard her on the phone with Her friend. My parents only adopted her because they felt sorry for her. But watch, when college applications come around, they'll realise blood is thicker than water. All their money is going to their real daughter's education. That was the last straw. I had already been accepted to Princeton with a partial scholarship, but I hadn't told anyone yet. I decided to let Brooke dig her own grave. Every time she skipped class to hang out with her boyfriend, I kept quiet. When she forged our mom's signature on her failed math test, I looked the other way. I watched as she dug herself deeper and deeper. The day college decisions were released, our parents gathered. We were all in the living room, sitting with our eyes glued to our laptops. My father, with his hand resting on his chin, watched in silence. My mother, anxious, faced back and forth with her already cold cup of tea in her hands. Brooke seemed too calm, which, coming from her, was almost always a sign that something was about to explode. Come on, Brooke, open that email already, my mother said, trying to smile. Brooke huffed as if this was all a waste of time. Ugh, relax. I know I got in. I didn't even need to look to know she still believed her own lie. She had sent applications to seven colleges, even with grades that barely met the minimum. For weeks, she spent more time setting up her Instagram aesthetic, For the decisions than actually filling out the forms. Delusion was a thick layer in my sister's life. She clicked. Silence lasted a second, the kind of second that seems to stretch until it becomes a weight in the air. Then she read, frowned, scrolled down the page, read again. This is a mistake, she murmured, pulling the laptop closer to her face. Honey? My father asked, his voice heavy with concern. Rejected. She spat the word like it was poison. They said my application doesn't meet the academic requirements. This is wrong. I, I had recommendation letters. My stomach churned, but I held back the smile that threatened to escape. It was cruel to rejoice in someone's downfall, I know. But there was something cathartic about watching her arrogance crumble layer by layer, as if for the first time, reality was returning. Everything she had spread along the way. One by one, Brooke opened the other emails. All the responses were variations of the same polite sentence. Unfortunately, your candidacy was not selected in this cycle. She turned white as paper. For the first time in a long time, Brooke was speechless. My father cleared his throat. Sweetheart, maybe we can look at other options. Community colleges, technical courses. No, she interrupted him, slamming the laptop shut. This doesn't make sense. I deserve to get in. That's when I opened my email. Without much ceremony, I left the laptop screen clearly visible on the table. The word congratulations was Emblazoned at the top of Princeton's digital letter. My mother came closer, read slowly, then turned her face to me with teary eyes. You. You already knew? I nodded. Why didn't you tell us? Because I need

I show up to practice Thursday night at the regular time and my three bandmates are sitting in a circle without their instruments like they're about to hold an intervention. Lead singer says we need to talk about the band's future. Battle of bands is in 10 days and apparently we need to level up our image. That's when I noticed the drummer's girlfriend standing in the corner holding a bass, my bass actually, that I let him borrow last week. She's holding it upside down. Lead singer looks at me, look, you're great and all, but she has the look we need. She's been learning bass for like two months. Two months. I've been carrying this band for three years. But sure, let's get the girl who thinks the bass has six strings. They vote 3 to 1 to replace me right there with me watching like I'm getting voted off a reality show. The guitarist who still can't play an F chord cleanly actually says it's nothing personal. Nobody's looking at the bassist anyway. Might as well have someone pretty back there. Nobody's looking at the bassist. I wrote half our songs. But okay, Brad, tell me more about how music works. The drummer's girlfriend tries to be nice. You can still come to the show if you want to support us, support them. Sure. Let me buy a ticket to watch you play my bass badly. Sounds like a dream Friday. Night. I don't argue, don't yell. Just say okay if that's what you all want. The lead singer seems surprised I'm not fighting back. Probably expected tears. Sorry to disappoint. They're already talking about keeping the band name and the set list for battle of bands. Acting like everything's normal. Planning tomorrow's practice like I was never even there. Like I'm already a ghost. The guitarist mentions they'll see me around and I just nod, give them a smile that doesn't reach my eyes, walk out quietly. I can hear them talking about stage positions as the door closes, how she'll look great in the back, how the judges will love having something nice to look at. They think this is over. They think I'm just going to crawl away and cry. That's cute. I'm sitting in my car in the driveway and my brain starts doing math. Tomorrow's practice. They kept saying see you at practice tomorrow to each other. But wait, that's my amp the guitarist uses because his sounds like a dying cat. My mixing board that makes our lead singer not sound like he's singing through a kazoo. The mic system I bought with birthday money, the cables, the stands, hell even the extension cords are mine. I check the battle of bands registration on my phone. The song list they submitted. Breaking Chains. I wrote that. Midnight Drive wrote that in my bedroom. Phoenix Rising, that's literally about my ex boyfriend. I have the notebooks. With the original lyrics in my handwriting. The van we use for gigs, mine, well, technically my mom's, but she lets me use it. And then it hits me. This, it's my dad's garage. Dad only lets them practice here because of me. I text him, hey, the band just kicked me out for not being pretty enough. He text back immediately, are you kidding me? They're banned. I'll change the garage code right now. My dad's the best. They kept saying, see you at practice tomorrow. They actually think they're still practicing here tomorrow in my dad's garage with my equipment, playing my songs. The delusion is actually impressive. Next day, five PM, I'm home.

I stopped at the doorway. This isn't one conversation, Maya. This is you revealing your actual plan for our marriage. You want a free nanny and a night shift worker, not a husband. That's not fair. What's not fair is expecting me to give up everything while you give up nothing. What's not fair is calling it a partnership when it's anything but. She started crying. I thought you loved my boys. I do. But love doesn't mean financial suicide. I packed that night. She kept texting saying I was overreacting, that we could compromise for compromise. I could keep my job, work from home and handle all pick up, drop off, homework, dinner and bedtime, basically still being the full time parent just with a laptop nearby. Then her mom called. You're being incredibly selfish, she said, and without even saying hello. Maya has been through so much with her divorce. She deserves a man who will support her. I agreed to support her, not replace her. Those boys need a father figure. They need a father figure who can actually afford to feed them. Money isn't everything. Tell that to the mortgage company. She huffed and hung up. Then came her sister with a novel length text about how real men sacrifice for their families, how her husband gave up his dreams, how that's what love is. I didn't respond. Three days later, Maya showed up at my new apartment with boys. They were holding a Poster that said we miss you with stick figures. See, she said triumphantly, they need you. Using her kids as emotional blackmail. That was low even for her. Maya, take them home. Not until you come back and apologize. I have nothing to apologize for. You're the one who wanted me to tank my career and our financial future. You're so focused on money. What about love? What about family? Family doesn't mean one person does everything while the other does whatever they want. She left crying. The boys looked confused. I felt terrible, but I knew I'd made the right choice. Last I heard from a mutual friend, Maya's on dating apps now. Now her profile apparently specifies, must love kids, have flexible schedule and understand that family comes first. Translation, must be willing to quit your job and raise my children while I maintain my lifestyle. Her friend said she'd been on six dates. Five guys stopped responding after the second date. The sixth one made it to date four before Maya mentioned her expectations. He apparently said, so you want to stay at home, dad, who also works nights, she said. Exactly. He paid his half of the check and left.

But the manager wasn't interested in hearing that. He told me to revert every single change I had made immediately. And he made it clear that my job depended on doing exactly that. So I did it. Within a week, scrap doubled. Some lines clogged constantly. Others slowed to a crawl. Alarms went off non stop. We lost 70 hours of uptime in five days, $10,000 an hour. The downtime alone cost us over a million dollars. Add the scrap and the total hit the 2 million Mark. Before the week was over, corporate scheduled an emergency meeting, not a small one. Every regional manager, top level engineer and plant head was on the call. The tone was tense from the moment it started. When they asked what happened, the room went quiet. I shared my screen and pulled up the historian logs. For every line, I showed three sets of charts, baseline before my changes, the improved performance after my changes, and the sudden drop after being forced to revert everything. It was all there in plain sight. I explained that standardizing code, set points and general procedures made sense, but controller constants were different. They were meant to be tuned to each specific machine. The physics demanded it and the data proved it. I walked through each case step by step without emotion and without any intention other than clarity. By the time I Finished. The me thing was silent. Then the engineering VP asked one simple question. Why didn't anyone know this? I stayed quiet. The answer was obvious. The manager who created the rule had been enforcing it for years. He put pushed it across multiple factories, convinced it made him look like a champion of standardization. In reality, it had been holding performance back everywhere it was applied. A week later, he was no longer with the company. As for me, my plant saw a dramatic improvement. Once my tuning changes were restored, we hit the highest yields in our history. Uptime broke new records. And at the end of the year, I got a bonus equal to 40% of my salary. Even better, everyone at my plant got max level bonuses. Since the site numbers were so strong, I never set out to challenge anyone. I just tuned the systems the way they were meant to be tuned. But in the end, the data spoke louder than anything else.

So I made sure he saw exactly how much I didn't need him. Uncle Wayne was worth millions but lived like a miser, constantly testing our family to see who was worthy of his money.

I'm leaving everything to whoever proves they don't need it, he'd announce at family dinners while everyone kissed his ass and hung on his every word. My cousins would bring him expensive gifts they couldn't afford, offer to clean his house for free, practically beg for his attention and validation. They'd research his interests and pretend to share his hobbies. My cousin Kyle even switched his major to business because Uncle Wayne mentioned he respected entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, I brought nothing and sat in the corner reading a book, completely disinterested in his little power games. He doesn't seem to care about family, he'd say loud enough for me to hear, testing to see if I'd scramble for his approval like the others. You're right, I'd reply without looking up from my book. I don't care about your money either. This always made him pause. While my cousins were falling over themselves to prove their worth, I was actively proving my indifference. While they fought over who could drive him to appointments and grocery shop for him, I got a second job and Started saving every penny. While they argued about his will, I was building my own future. When they'd ask why I never visited Uncle Wayne, I'd say, he has plenty of volunteers. I found his manipulation disgusting. Watching grown adults debase themselves for money made me sick. I'd rather be broke with dignity than rich through desperation. My cousins thought I was crazy. Don't you want financial security? Anna would ask. I'm setting myself up without begging, I'd tell her. While they spent their weekends doing his yard work and running his errands, I was working overtime and taking online courses to improve my skills. While they were buying him birthday presents and Christmas gifts, I was investing in my education and building an emergency fund. The dynamic was fascinating to watch. The more desperate they became for his approval, the more he seemed to enjoy withholding it. The more I ignored him, the more curious he became about me. At family gatherings, he'd try to bait me into conversations about money and success. I'd give polite, brief responses and go back to whatever I was doing. I wasn't rude, but I wasn't performing for him either. Grace, what are your career plans? He'd ask in front of everyone. Working on it, I'd say, simply not elaborating.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together, I've been playing husband since year 2, paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down, tears in her eyes, hand on her heart. Then some perfectly rehearsed excuse, we're not ready. Let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5, and she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time, convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it when she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew, and she didn't even let me finish the speech. Just shook her head with this pitying smile like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke, asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant and the mask came. Completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said. Voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place. After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place. Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I'd spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. I didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working, she texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic started. Creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night acting extra sweet. Made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said. Kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died during her lunch break. By day 3, when her car payment bounced, she went from confused.

My brother's boss disagreed. I walk into the restaurant holding my eight year old daughter's hand, and she's never met these people. My family cut me off when I got pregnant at 17, called me a disappointment, and slammed the door in my face. Eight years later, they finally agreed to meet us. My mother looks me up and down. Oh, honey, at least you tried to look nice. I'm wearing my favourite sundress, but apparently it's not enough. She hugs my daughter like she has the right. She's so well behaved despite everything. Despite everything. Like my daughter's existence is something to overcome. My sister asks if I need money for school clothes. My father won't even look at me directly. They picked this specific restaurant because it's affordable, which means they think I'm broke. My mother actually says, don't worry, sweetie, we ordered water for the table. We know being a single mom is hard. The server keeps glancing at me nervously, but I shake my head at her. My brother slides a 20 across the table for gas money home like I'm still 17, borrowing the family car. My mother asks if I ever finished high school. When I say I graduated college, she goes, oh, online degrees count too, honey. Then my brother stands up all proud. I have an announcement. I just got hired as restaurant manager at this very chain. Everyone's clapping, and my mother says, See? Your brother didn't ruin his life, and look where he is now. My brother's bragging. I'm one of only four managers in the whole district. Report directly to regional. I'm making 60,000 a year. My father finally speaks to me maybe your brother can get you a job here. They're always hiring servers. My mother asks where the father of my daughter is, and I say he left. Of course he did. What did you expect from having a baby so young? My sister shows photos from her Paris vacation last summer, then tells me maybe someday you can take your daughter somewhere nice. At one point I managed to get out that I work in the restaurant industry. However, they keep assuming I mean waitressing. My mother tells another table very loudly my daughter had so much potential. Got pregnant at 17. We tried to help, but she wouldn't listen. My daughter asks why grandma seems angry and I tell her grandma's just confused. My brother is still going on about his promotion. The owner is supposed to stop by today, actually doing rounds at all the locations. The servers getting more nervous hovering nearby. But I'm waiting. My family keeps talking about how hard being a single mother must be, how I probably can't afford daycare, how my daughter probably doesn't have a college fund. Such a shame. My mother says she was so smart before she threw it all away. My daughter squeezes my hand under The table. She knows something they don't. The manager approaches our table and my brother jumps up.

My girlfriend Taylor and I were both 20, and things had been going pretty solid between us for about eight months. She had this step brother, Ethan, who was 23. And honestly, the few times I'd met him before, he seemed like a normal dude. Maybe a little too friendly, but nothing that set off major alarm bells. Two weeks ago, Taylor asked if Ethan could come hang out at my place for a few hours. She said he was bringing pizza and beer, and since my parents were visiting my aunt for the weekend, I figured, why not? My little sister Mia is 15, and she was just gonna stay upstairs doing homework anyway. So they showed up around 7. Ethan had this huge grin and two cases of beer. We started drinking and playing video games, just chilling on the couch. Everything was normal for, like, an hour. Taylor was curled up next to me. Ethan was cracking jokes about the game, and I was thinking, this was actually pretty fun. Then Ethan said he needed to use the bathroom. I pointed down the hall to the one on the first floor. Taylor and I kept playing, and I didn't even notice how long he'd been gone until we heard yelling upstairs. My blood went cold. Mia never yells. We both jumped up and ran upstairs, and I found my sister standing in her doorway crying, like full on sobbing. Ethan was right there in the hallway looking all flustered and red in the face. I immediately asked Mia what happened, and she could barely get the words out between sobs. She said Ethan had walked into her room, even though her door was only cracked open a little. She thought maybe he was lost, looking for the bathroom, so she tried to be

So I exposed 22 years of lies and my sister collapsed in tears. Outside, I stood at the podium as valedictorian, scanning the auditorium for my parents. Empty seats. My phone buzzed, a text from mom, running late, sweetie, your sister needed her pedicure appointment. We'll catch the recording. My sister Madison was 26, unemployed, living at home. I was graduating top of my class after working three jobs to pay my own way through college. They chose her pedicure. The applause after my speech felt hollow. I smiled through photos with friends whose families showed up. Then I drove home in silence. That text burning in my mind. When I walked in, Madison was on the couch eat propped up, showing off sparkly pink toenails to mom. Oh, honey, you're back. How was it, mom asked brightly. Couldn't tell you, I said flatly. You weren't there. Dad walked in with wine. Don't be dramatic, Liam. We had a conflict. Life happens. A conflict. 22 years of my achievements treated like background noise while Madison got celebrated for breathing. Every honor roll certificate met with. That's nice, dear. While Madison's community college application got a family dinner. My scholarship to Stanford. Good for you. Madison deciding to drop out after one semester. She finding herself. We're so proud of her journey. That night, something inside me snapped. I wasn't sad anymore. I was done. I went to my childhood. Room and started looking through old boxes. What I found made my blood run cold. My acceptance letter to a prestigious art program at 16 never shown to me. A scholarship offer for $15,000. Also hidden, letters from my grandparents addressed to me, dozens of them, never delivered. Birthday checks made out to me deposited into Madison's account. Bank statement showing my college fund, the one grandpa set up, completely drained, $47,000 transferred to Madison over four years. I photographed everything, every letter, every bank statement, every stolen opportunity. Then I kept digging. Madison's resume listed a.

So I packed my bags before she even finished the sentence. We were three months from the wedding when Maya dropped it on me over dinner. Once we're married, you should stay home with the boys. They need a father figure full time. Her two kids were 8 and 10. Sweet kids, but not mine biologically. Work in IT making 78 K. She was a yoga instructor making 35 K. Stay home. I asked carefully. What about my career? She waved her for dismissively. We'll manage. The boys need stability more than we need extra income. I set down my glass. Your income is 35,000 a year. Our mortgage alone is 2,000 to 400 a month. That's 28,800 just for housing. We'll figure it out. You can do some financing. At night, after they go to bed. At night? After parenting her kids all day. Maya, the math doesn't work. We'd be losing the house in six, two months. She got that stubborn look. You're being dramatic. Plenty of families live on one income. Families where that one income actually covers their expenses. And came the kicker. Oh, and I'm keeping my spa Wednesdays and my monthly girls weekend trips. I need self care. Being a mom is exhausting. I just stared at her. Let me understand this correctly. I quit my job, become a full Time parent to your children. Somehow work freelance gigs at night to supplement your income. That won't cover our bills while you keep your spa days and weekend getaways. Exactly. See? You get it. I knew you'd understand. No, Maya, I really don't understand at all. Her smile faded. What's that supposed to mean? It means your plan is insane. You want me to sacrifice my career, my income and apparently my sleep while you sacrifice nothing. She got defensive immediately. I'm sacrificing. I work hard teaching yoga and raising two boys is a full time job. Then why do you need me to stay home if you're already doing it? Because I need help. My ex never helped with anything. Maybe because he was working 60 hours a week to support three people. Her face went cold. If you're not committed to my boys, you're not committed to me. A real partner would wanna be there for them. A real partner would also want both people contributing fairly. Contributing fairly? I'm giving you the privilege of being their father. That word, privilege. Like I should be grateful for the opportunity to abandon my career and financial security. This conversation is over. I said standing up. Where are you going? She demanded to pack.

I've spent my career as a factory automation engineer, and I've worked at some intense places, including a short stretch at Tesla. So when I joined my current factory, I didn't expect to make waves. I just wanted to solve problems, tune equipment, and keep things running smoothly. On my very first month, I noticed that one particular production line had an issue that had apparently existed for almost 20 years. The moment I saw it, I recognized the exact type of control problem. It matched the same kind of systems I had studied in engineering school where small hardware variations caused big headaches if the control constants weren't adjusted. My supervisor didn't hesitate to approve the fix. Production management gave me the green light too. And since the other lines were working well enough, I didn't touch anything else. I just tuned this one problem line. The results were immediate. That line finally ran the way it was supposed to. Wrap dropped, uptime increased, and the operators were thrilled. It wasn't perfect, but compared to how they'd been fighting that equipment for years, it felt like a miracle. So I kept going. Over the next six months, I tuned dozens of processes across the factory. Nothing extreme, just subtle parameter adjustments that accounted for real differences in motors, heaters, sensors, and actuators. These weren't guesses. Each adjustment was backed by data charts and live performance metrics. I thought everything was going great until the day corporate engineering walked in. The corporate engineering manager pulled me aside with the kind of tone that made it clear I had stepped into something bigger than I realized. He informed me that I had violated a rule he had put in place years ago. All processes in all factories under his oversight were required to run on the same identical set of controller constants. I was stunned. In automation, that kind of rule doesn't just limit you. It ignores physical reality. Two motors from the same production batch can behave differently. Heating elements age, sensors, drift lines wear differently. No two pieces of equipment behave exactly the same. And trying to force them into a single set of control constants is

When I got pregnant, I called my parents to tell them they were going to be grandparents for the first time. My mom said, that's nice, honey, and then spent 20 minutes telling me about the house Natalie he was buying. Throughout my pregnancy, they asked how I was feeling exactly twice, but Natalie's house became the only thing they could talk about. Every conversation was about her new countertops or her backyard or her paint colors. My mother in law threw me a baby shower and my parents showed up 30 minutes late and left early because they were helping Natalie pick out furniture. My due date got moved up and the doctor scheduled a C section because the baby was breech. I called my parents and told them the date and time. My mom said, oh, we'll definitely be there. This is our first grandbaby. For the first time in my life, I felt like maybe they were finally going to show up for me. My mother in law was so excited she started crying when I Told her the C section date. She bought an outfit specific for meeting her first grandchild and had been texting me every day asking how I was feeling. My father in law took the whole week off work so he could help us when we brought the baby home. Two weeks before the C section, my mom called and said, so we have a little situation. Natalie scheduled her housewarming party for the same day as your C section. She sent out invitations months ago, and she really. He wants us there. I felt my entire chest tighten. I said she knew when my C section was scheduled. My mom said, I know, but this party is really important to her. She's worked so hard on this house. We'll come by the hospital after if we can. I said, if you can. She said, the party starts at 2 and you're scheduled for noon, so we'll probably still be at Natalie's, but we'll try to stop by that evening. I said, I'm having major surgery to deliver your first grandchild. My dad got on the phone and said, you're being really selfish right now. Your sister has been planning this party for months. You'll have your husband's parents there. Natalie only has us. The morning of my C section, my mother in law and father in law were at the hospital by 7, even though we didn't need to be there until 11. They brought me breakfast and sat with Me while I filled out paperwork, my mother in law held my hand and told me

They were in the waiting area. When they took me back for surgery, everything went wrong. My blood pressure dropped and the baby's heart rate was all over the place. I could hear the doctors talking in urgent voices and see the nurses moving fast. They got the baby out, but she wasn't crying for 10 seconds. That felt like 10 hours. There was just silence. Then she screamed and I started sobbing. They brought her over and put her on my chest, and she was perfect. In recovery, my in laws were waiting with flowers and balloons. My mother in law was crying, and my father in law kept saying, she's beautiful. She looks just like you. They stayed with me for hours, taking turns holding the baby and bringing me water and telling me what an amazing mother I was going to be. Around 6 that evening, my parents walked into the hospital room. They were loud and laughing, and I could smell wine on them from across the room. My mom saw the baby in my mother in law's arms, and her whole face changed. She rushed over and said, oh, my god, let me hold her. She took the baby and stared at her and started crying. She said, she's perfect. Look at her little hands. I can't believe I'm a grandmother. My dad came over and looked at the baby and his eyes got wet. He said, she's beautiful. She Looks like you did when you were born. My mom turned to me and said, why didn't you tell us it was happening now? We would have been here. I stared at her. I said, I told you two weeks ago. You chose Natalie's party. My dad said, we didn't realize the baby would be here already. We thought we had time. My father in law stood up and said, you need to leave. My mom clutched the baby tighter and said, we just got here. We want to spend time with our granddaughter. I said, give her back to her grandmother and pointed at my mother in law. My mom's face crumpled and she handed the baby over. I said, you chose a housewarming party over your daughter's life threatening surgery and the birth of your first grandchild. You showed up six hours late, drunk, and you want me to believe you care now? My dad said, please, we made a mistake. We want to be in her life. I said, get out. My mom tried to take a photo of the baby before leaving and my father in law deleted it from her phone. They haven't seen her since.

I didn't tell them anything. The next day before class, I spotted Kate and Iris by the water fountain. So are you ready? Kate asked. I don't know, Iris said nervously. What if I can't do it? You'll be fine. We've done this 100 times. But what if he notices he won't just meet me at lunch? They glanced around nervously before walking away. My chest hurt. They've been planning this and I was too stupid to notice. I started acting more distant with everyone, colder. My friends noticed immediately. Ashar and Wayne kept signing, what's wrong? But I wouldn't explain. Maybe they were all in on it. Maybe I really was just the charity case. Couple days later, I caught Kate and Iris outside the cafeteria. Look, you're getting better, but it needs to be perfect, Kate was saying. What if I completely freeze up? Iris asked. Well, the dance is in three days, Kate said. You have to be ready by then. My eyes widened. That was the dance I've been dreaming of going to with Iris for years. They were going to do something at it. Decided that's when I'd reveal everything. I'd show up, catch them and drop a bomb. The next three days were torture. My friends kept trying to talk to me. They looked hurt and confused, but I couldn't tell them. On the day of the dance, I was at my locker. I was planning to avoid everyone until tonight. Then Iris walked up to me alone. I looked at her confused, wondering why she was here. Had she realized her and Cade were caught? I looked behind her and saw Cade, Oscar and Wayne all watching from down the hall. Iris looked terrified and took a deep breath. Then out of nowhere, she started signing to me, I like you. She was concentrating on each letter. Will you go to the dance with me? Her hands were shaking. Her signing was rough and unpracticed, like someone who just Learned. That's when it hit me. I believe it. Kate wasn't dating Iris. He was teaching her sign language. Because she likes me and wants me to go to the dance with her. My friends weren't betraying me. They were helping her tell me she liked me. I signed yes so fast. Iris laughed. Then I spoke out loud. I'd love to go to the dance. Her eyes went huge, pulled back my hair and showed the hearing aid. I got these three days ago. I thought you and Cade. I couldn't even finish. The guys were already running over. Dude, you can hear. They started hitting lockers and jumping around. I'd never seen them act this manic. They were always so nonchalant and cool. Seeing them drop that for me felt just as good as hearing. Fast forward 13 years. Iris and I are married. Cade was my best man. Ozer and Wayne, my groomsmen, my mom now trust them completely.

My cat, Oliver, trained me to sleep with one hand hanging off the bed. And that's how I caught someone breaking into my house at 3:00am. It started when Oliver was just a kitten. Every night, he'd paw at my dangling hand until I pet him. For two years, I couldn't fall asleep unless my arm was hanging down, waiting for his soft fur. One night, instead of Oliver's fur, I felt human hair. My eyes shot open, but I kept my breathing steady, pretending to be asleep. Someone was crouched beside my bed. In the dim light from my window, I could make out a man wearing all black going through my bedside drawer. My heart was pounding so hard, I thought he'd hear it. Oliver wasn't in his usual spot. That should have been my first clue something was wrong. The intruder's head was right under my hanging hand. I had two choices. Scream and hope the neighbors heard, or do something really stupid. I chose stupid. I grabbed a fistful of his hair and yanked as hard as I could. He yelped and fell backward. I rolled off the other side of the bed, taking my phone with me. The guy scrambled up, but his hoodie caught on my lamp, pulling it down with a crash. Get out! I screamed, already dialing 9 1 1. I have a gun! I didn't, but he didn't know that. He bolted. For the door. I heard him stumbling down the stairs, knocking things over. That's when I noticed something odd. He wasn't going for the front door. He was heading for my basement. The 9 1 1 operator was asking for my address when I heard a familiar voice from downstairs. Babe, what's all that noise? My blood ran cold. That was Greg's voice. Greg, my boyfriend of eight months who I'd given a key to last week. Greg, who was supposed to be on a business trip to Boston. I crept to the top of the stairs, phone still pressed to my ear. There's someone in my house, I whispered to the operator. I think. I think I know who it is. Greg's voice floated up again. Damn it, Patrick! You were supposed to wait until she took her sleeping pills. My hand shook. Patrick, Greg's work friend who'd been over for dinner twice, who'd use my bathroom both times, right next to my bedroom where I kept my prescription sleep aids. I've been casing my house, learning my routine. Greg knew I had a safe in my closet. Knew that's where I kept my grandmother's jewelry, worth nearly $50,000. The operator was saying something about police being four minutes away. I heard doors opening downstairs. They were looking for something. Then I remembered Oliver. He always slept under my bed. During all this chaos, he hadn't made a sound. I crouched down to check. There was Oliver crammed against The wall, fur puffed up. Next to him was Greg's phone.

I'm three months pregnant, and literally the only thing I can keep down is steak and baked potatoes with sour cream. Which is weird, because before this, I was a chicken nuggets and fries kind of person, never touch steak. But now if I don't eat it, I feel like I'm gonna pass out. So every night, I make two meals. One for my fiance and our two kids, and one for me. Tonight I made baked pizza, spaghetti with fried catfish and dinner rolls. The kids love it. I've been doing this for weeks now, and nobody said anything. I was plating everyone's food when my fiance Danny, walks up and goes, actually, I want what you're having. I looked at him confused because he literally saw me thaw out one steak this morning. He knew what was for dinner because I plan everything the night before and write it on the fridge calendar. I told him I only made one steak, and that's mine. There's plenty of catfish left. He crossed his arms and said, we can share it. Then I shook my head and explained that I'm eating for two, and this one steak barely fills me up as it is. I told him he has a whole meal he can get seconds of, while I only have this. That's when he got mad. He called me a selfish woman using pregnancy as an Excuse to be selfish. I just stared at him because where did this even come from? I asked him, what's different about today compared to the last two months when I've been eating steak literally every single night. He didn't answer, just said, it's the principal bay and walked off to eat his catfish. We haven't really talked since. Just good morning and goodbye. When he leaves for work, he's been slamming cabinets and giving me these looks like I'm the worst person alive. His mom even texted me yesterday asking why I'm being difficult during my pregnancy. Apparently, he told her I'm hoarding food from him. I went to my sister's place because I couldn't deal with the tension. She laughed when I told her and said, he's being a baby. But then my mom called and said I should have just given him half and made myself something else to keep the peace. The thing is, I tried eating other stuff. I physically can't. Two weeks ago, I tried to eat chicken and threw up for an hour. I've been to the doctor about it, and they said it's normal for some women to have very specific cravings and food aversions. They told me to just eat what I can. Danny came home last night with a bag from the grocery store. I thought maybe he was over it. Nope. He bought himself two steaks and made a big show of cooking them in front of me. Didn't Offer me any? Just sat at the table eating while I had my one steak and looked at me the whole time. The kids asked why daddy was being weird, and he said, ask your mother. I'm doing six months, and I don't know if I can deal with this the whole time.

When I was 8, my neighbor, Mister Wilson, would pay me $5 to help him feed the birds in his backyard every Saturday. I thought I had the easiest job in the world, just scattering bird seed while he took pictures from his deck. He always insisted I wear the same yellow dress. Birds are attracted to bright colors, he explained. I believed him completely. My parents thought it was sweet that an elderly widower had found a. It's good for him to have something to look forward to, mom would say, as she helped me into that scratchy yellow dress. Each weekend, Mister Wilson had very specific instructions. I had to skip in certain patterns, bend a particular way to scatter the seeds, twirl three times before collecting my $5. He called these my bird calling moves. The birds won't come if you don't do it exactly right, he'd say. Hey, adjusting his camera, I rarely saw any actual birds, but he assured me they came after I left. I remember once asking why he never showed me the bird pictures. He smiled and said they were for a special bird watching club. I imagined serious adults in safari hats nodding approvingly at photos of me with cardinals and blue jays. When I turned 10, he doubled my pay to $10 and asked if I could bring a friend. Birds love when There are two children, he explained, so I brought Emma from next door. We took turns in the yellow dress. After a few weeks, Emma refused to come back. My mom says I can't, she said, at school, avoiding my eyes. I figured her parents needed her for chores and felt secretly pleased to have my bird job back to myself. For my 11th birthday, Mr Wilson gave me a silver bracelet with tiny bird charms. Don't tell your parents, he whispered. They might get jealous of our special friendship. It was the prettiest thing I'd ever owned and I hid it in my sock drawer. One Saturday, Mr Wilson's adult son visited unexpectedly while I was there. I was mid twirl when he walked into the backyard. He looked at me, then at his father, then at the camera. His face changed in a way I couldn't understand at the time. Dad, what the hell is this? He shouted. Mr Wilson hurried me home without my $10, telling me we feed the birds another day. I was confused and worried I'd done my twirls wrong. The next day, police cars parked outside Mr Wilson's house. Men carried out boxes and his computer. I watched from my bedroom window, wondering if they were from the bird watching club. My parents sat me down that evening with strange, serious faces. They asked uncomfortable questions about the bird feeding, the yellow dress, the photos. I answered truthfully, not understanding why mom kept Crying. Mr Wilson moved away after that. The neighbor.

So I go to the gym at, like, 6 in the morning because that's when it's empty and I don't have to wait for equipment. I've been doing the same routine for maybe eight months now, and I always use the squat rack first thing because it gets me warmed up. This particular Tuesday, I walk in and head straight to the rack like usual. I load up my weights, do my first set, and I'm resting between sets when this guy walks up. He's probably in his 40s, wearing one of those tank tops that shows way too much side, and he's got his phone in one hand with earbuds in. He stands there for a second, and I figure he's waiting to ask how many sets I have left. Normal gym stuff. But instead he just goes, are you almost done? I tell him, I just started, and I've got, like, four more sets. He looks at me and goes, well, I need to use this for my workout. I'm confused because there's literally another squat rack open like 15 feet away. I point at it and say, that one's free. He shakes his head. I use this one. I always use this rack. I've never seen this guy before in my life. I tell him, sorry, but I got here first, and I'll be done in maybe 20 minutes. He just stands there staring. At me and goes, you're being really selfish right now. I ignore him and do my next set. When I'm done, he's still standing there with his arms crossed. I'm resting again, and he goes, you know what? You're a bitch. Just like that. Calls me a bitch in the middle of the gym at six in the morning over a squat rack. I finish my set, rack my weights, and walk away. I don't say anything back because I'm not trying to get kicked out, but I'm pissed. I go do my other exercises, and I keep seeing him using the rack, grunting super loud with every rep, slamming the weights down. Real obnoxious stuff. I finish my workout and leave. But the whole drive home, I'm thinking about it. Nobody's ever called me that at the gym before. I'm not the type to start problems. I just go in, do my thing, and leave. The next morning, I get there at the same time. He's not there yet. I go straight to the squat rack, and I start my workout. About 10 minutes in, he walks through the door. I see him spot me at the rack, and his whole face changes. He walks over and goes, seriously? Again

She said I owed her an apology and until I gave one, she wasn't coming to any family events I'd be at. Jake's brother Colin texted back asking why she was in our yard without telling us first. She ignored that question. Jake's aunt said maybe we should all calm down. Patricia sent three paragraphs about how she's being attacked by everyone. Jake told me I should just apologize to make it stop. I said absolutely not. She was wrong. He said I wasn't wrong, but sometimes you apologize just to peace. I told him that's why his mom keeps doing whatever she wants because nobody ever tells her no. We didn't talk much the rest of the night. The next day, Patricia showed up at Jake's office. Co worker told me later she was there for over an hour. She wanted Jake to make me apologize. He told her he couldn't make me do anything and that she should have called before coming over. She started crying in the office lobby. That weekend was Jake's dad's birthday dinner. Trisha said she wasn't going if I was there. Jake told her that was her choice, but we were going. She called him a terrible son. We went to the dinner. She didn't show up. Jake's dad asked where she was. Jake explained the whole thing. His dad sat quiet for a minute then said Patricia needs to learn boundaries and He's proud of Jake for backing me up. Jake's brothers agreed. They said she's pulled stuff like this before with their girlfriends. Two weeks went by. Patricia sent me a long email. It said she'd been talking to her book club friends and they all agreed I was wrong, that even in your own yard, you should be modest because you never know who might see that I clearly don't respect family, that she'd forgive me if I apologized. I deleted the email.

Slipping into the shadows, I pulled out the tools I had brought with me and started working on getting his fingerprints. But as soon as I entered the code, the alarm went off. My heart skipped a beat, but luckily, it didn't wake him up. Refusing to give up, I tried again, and somehow I nailed the code this time. Opening the safe, I grabbed all the cash inside. Then I slipped all the fake bills I had taken from the tire into the safe, replacing the real money. With everything in place, I was about to put the tire, now filled with real cash, back on the car. But at that exact moment, the rich guy suddenly woke up. He spotted me and said his safe had been robbed. I froze, stunned. I had clearly put all the fake cash inside, so why was the safe empty? I followed him to the safe, and sure enough, the money was gone. Then he told me that money was crucial. It was supposed to pay for his daughter's medical treatment. I didn't believe him. For a guy like him, that amount was pocket change. But then he dropped a bombshell. He was bankrupt. The house wasn't even his anymore, and he couldn't afford his daughter's bills. Seeing how desperate he was, I couldn't go through with stealing from him anymore. So I went back to the garage, retrieved the cash hidden in the Tire and came clean to him. But to my surprise, he already knew everything I know. He said. By the way, the thief has already been caught. Caught, huh? Caught? What do you mean caught? How? Don't you recognize your partner

So I snapped. What I discovered when I got there made me realize I'd raised a monster. And I had to choose between my son and doing what was right. When my daughter in law, Emma, called, asking me to visit, I could hear something was wrong. She just had the baby three weeks ago, but her voice sounded hollow, defeated. I just. I need help, she whispered into the phone. But don't tell Kevin I called you. Red flag number one. Why couldn't she tell my son she needed support? I drove the four hours to their house. Immediately. Kevin answered the door, looking well rested, freshly showered, wearing clean clothes. Mom, what are you doing here? Emma called, I said, pushing past him. Where is she? I found Emma in the nursery, still in the same pajamas she'd probably worn for days. The baby was screaming, Emma was crying. The house was a disaster. Honey, when's the last time you slept? I asked. I don't know, she said, announcing the baby mechanically. Tuesday. What day is it now? It was Friday. Kevin walked in, eating a sandwich. She's been a little emotional lately, he said casually. Hormones, you know? I looked at my son, my son, who I'd raised to respect women, and felt sick. When's the last time you held your daughter? I asked him. I held her yesterday, he said defensively. For like 20 minutes while Emma showered. 20 minutes? In a week? Your wife just had major surgery. She needs help. I work all day, he said. I'm tired too. Emma was back at work. No, turns out Kevin meant his part time job at his buddies auto shop. Three days a week, four hours each. Meanwhile, Emma was up every two hours feeding the baby, doing all the night wakings, plus somehow managing to keep the house from completely falling apart. I told her she could sleep when the baby sleeps, Kevin said. Like he'd solve the problem, but she always finds something to clean instead. I watched Emma flinch at this like she was afraid to rest. That's when I realized what was really happening here. Emma, show me your phone, I said gently. She hesitated, glancing at Kevin nervously. It's okay, I said. Just show me.

Los soldados querían capturar al parásito disparando una red para atraparlo, pero el parásito al instante se convirtió en mucosidad.

He refused to sell it. Suddenly, some new park administrators had come up, and they were trying to, like, say, we're gonna take it. And he wouldn't sell it. And so suddenly started getting these email for a website for pictures. He deleted it, and then it came again two days later, deleted it. Then another one came and deleted it. Then another one came in. Every day. We're talking about every day, four or five a day of these email saying to visit the website. Very specific saying what it was. This went on for 90 days. Finally, one day, he clicked on click the unsubscribe and deleted it, thinking, maybe that will work. He gets arrested, like, three days later. They indict him, come and arrest him. And during the negotiations, they're trying to get his property. They're trying to use seizure to take his property. He's saying, what are you talking about? Like, seize what? He goes trial anyway, and his lawyer had put together enough of a defense a that the FBI was targeting him very specifically. They were trying to get him hemmed up so that they get a hold of his land somehow.

He had been following the boy by car for 10 whole minutes. The speedometer showed 12 miles per hour, yet the boy never slowed down. That left him a little stunned. Curious to see how far the kid could go, he kept driving behind him until the boy finally noticed. Why are you following me? You know how fast you were going. What are you, a cop? Can I give you a lift? No, but you can quit following me. As he watched the boy walk away, Jim fell into deep thought. The kid he just saw might really be something special. Back home, Jim started digging through old records. He compared times from previous state competitions, and the results shocked him. At that pace, the boy could easily rank among the top 10 runners in the entire state. And that's without proper running shoes. With the right gear, he might even be a champion. Jim felt like he had just discovered buried treasure. As a PE teacher and coach, finding a champion could change everything for him. His reputation, his pay, even his entire life could finally leave this small, forgotten town. This was McFarland, one of the poorest places in California. The only reason Jim ended up here was because he had no other choice. He used to be a promising coach, but after accidentally injuring a player during a Game. He was fired and labeled as hot tempered. No school wanted him anymore. Desperate for a job, he moved his entire family to this dusty little town. They were used to city life, so everyone struggled to adjust. There wasn't even a proper restaurant around. Not a single place selling burgers. Just tacos and burritos. Crime was bad, and Jim never felt safe. He hated everything about this place and wanted to leave that very day. But no other school would take him, so he had no choice but to stay and teach here. On his first day, he discovered just how undisciplined the students were. When he told them to warm up, three of them simply walked off, saying they had to go home to work on the farm. Jim didn't expect much anyway. He barely cared about the class. Just told the rest of them to jog a few laps and called it a day. But that's when he noticed something strange. These kids were good at running. Still, he didn't think much of it. Until one evening, driving home, he saw Thomas. The boy was running at 12 miles per hour again. Jim couldn't believe it. At that speed, Thomas could run a mile in five minutes. The world record for Marathon pace was just slightly faster. Thomas was a rare talent. The first time in a long while, Jim felt a spark of hope. If he could bring these runners together, form a cross country Team and lead them to victory. He might become a respected coach again. Maybe even find a better job elsewhere. He went straight to the principal with his idea. But the principal wasn't interested. There was no funding. That didn't stop Jim. California public school system pre approved six new sports a few years ago. How to get funding for new lockers, including guess what? Cross country. The principal finally agreed. Now that the team was approved, Jim needed runners in class. He set up a small race. The top four would each get a sports drink. The students jumped at the chance. After the run, Jim picked the best finishers and invited them to join his team. The first to say yes was Johnny, who already loved running. With Johnny's help, Jim Jim quickly recruited seven runners in total. Of course, Thomas was one of them. Training began, but every time Jim tried running with them, he was out of breath halfway through. Four kids who ran to school every day. Though this was nothing. They finished the drills easily. Watching them gulp down free tap water after training, Jim felt a pang of guilt. None of them even owned real running shoe. He said nothing, but he was deeply moved. To test their true ability, he soon registered them for a local race and bought them new uniforms and shoes. News. The boys were thrilled and full of confidence. But cross country was a team sport. Scores were Based on placement, one point for first, two for second, and so on. Only the top five runners from each team counted, and the lowest total score won. Before the race, other schools laughed at them. They came from McFarland, the forest town around. The boys felt humiliated, but also determined to prove themselves. When the race started, Thomas ran among the top three. Others were doing fine, too. On flat ground, Thomas was unbeatable. But when the hills came, his pace dropped fast. One after another, runners passed him. By the time he reached the finish line, he was outside the top 10. Their team came in last. Still, Jim took full responsibility. He blamed himself for not scouting the course earlier. He was disappointed, but not defeated. They had trained too lightly. The next day, he found a steep hill nearby that became their new training ground. The boys ran until they were gasping for air. When they asked to rest, Jim refused. He told them real victories come only through hard work. They kept running until they could barely stand. Only Thomas kept going, stubborn as ever. To him, no matter how much they trained, nothing would change their lives. Though those hills they ran on were made of almond shells. The same shells they had to shovel for work every day. To Thomas, training on them felt meaningless. Even if they won, they still end up in the fields. And he was right. These kids were All children of farm workers, many of them woke up at 5 to wash cars for extra money. Before sunset, they'd ride on trucks to pick crops. That was their life during school breaks. During the week, they got up at 4:30 every morning, climbed onto farm trucks half asleep, and spend hours bent over under the scorching sun. Only when school was about to start did they take off their hats and run through the dusty wind toward class. No wonder they were such strong runners. After learning all this, Jim made a promise to himself. He would help these kids run their way to a better life. He started studying everything he could about cross country. He watched old tapes, learning every technique. Then day after day, he passed that knowledge on, riding his pink bicycle alongside the team as they trained. Jim worked hard, and so did the boys. After weeks of training, Macfarlane High faced one of the best teams in the district. Before the race, Jim gathered his runners and lifted their spirits. Where are we from? Unola. Los Gladiators. We fought it. The race began. They fell behind at first, but their endurance carried them through. When other runners began to fade, Thomas stayed calm and focused. Near the end, he surged forward, passing everyone ahead. The rest of the team followed one by one. They won their very first race. No wild Celebration, just quiet hugs. But in their hearts, they knew this Victory meant everything. A few days later, trouble struck again. Three brothers, Danny and his siblings, suddenly quit the team. Jim went to their house to find out why, but their father shut the door on him. Cross countries like a TV, he said. It's not a necessity. Every hour my son spend training with you is an hour they could be helping me in the fields. You city people will never understand that. But Jim didn't give up. The next morning, as the brothers climbed onto the farm truck, they were shocked to see Jim sitting among them. Under the blazing sun, he bent down and picked cabbages beside them. By noon, he was exhausted. Only then did he truly understand how hard their lives were. So he made a deal with them. When you have to work late, we'll train afterward. And on days you need to harvest early, I'll come help. We'll make it work together. He kept his word, and soon the boy's mother noticed his effort. She wasn't easy to convince, but she had a kind heart. The next day, she organized a community fundraiser for the team. The townspeople, all Mexican immigrants, came together joyfully. They donated what little they could. Thanks to them, the team finally had proper uniforms and running shoes. With new gear, training went smoother than ever. From dusty hills to green fields, from golden wheat plains to shaded forests, boys ran everywhere, leaving their sweat and dreams behind. Jim Told them, if we keep winning, we'll make it to the state championship. I can't run for you. But if you want to win, you have to believe in yourselves and in each other. With that trust, they kept winning. Race after race, their names appeared in newspapers. Cross country gave them not only honor, but something even greater, hope. One day, an English teacher read aloud a piece written by Jose, one of the runners. We fly like blackbirds through the morning rain. We rise with the warm wind. When we run, we are the masters of the earth. Our souls soar high, speaking to the gods, watching the world from above. In that moment, we are no longer immigrants, no longer the foolish Mexicans they think we are. The teacher was moved to tears. He thanked Jim for changing their lives. Before the final race that could take them to state, Jim handed out college brochures. He told them, if you make it to college, you can earn enough to help your families for real. After so many wins, he had become the pride of McFarland. At the regional finals, all they needed was a top four finish to qualify. Right before the race, Jim received an offer from a prestigious high school. A chance to finally earn more and move away. But this time, he hesitated. He couldn't just walk away from these kids when the starting gun fired. Everything they had endured LED to this moment. Thomas took the lead, the others close behind. The hill that once broke them now felt like level ground. Thomas reached the final stretch, still in first place, but a glance over his shoulder made him stumble and fall. He got back up and ran as fast as he could, but finished second. One by one, the others crossed the line. Then came the tense moment of the final results. First place was announced, then second, then third. If they could just get fourth, they'd move on to state. But just then, Thomas turned to Jim and revealed a secret. A secret that would change all of their lives forever. Want to know what happened next? Follow me. The rest of the story is coming soon.

I'm invading your home. That's what I was thinking. Um, if I break in, uh, surreptitiously, right, without you knowing, if I break in and then you happen to pop up out of the bedroom, that would be burglary of a occupied dwelling. Um, so I. 18 years old, and I'm with one of my homeboys that I had met in one of the, uh, level 2 schools that I had to go to. Horrible. Yeah. Yeah, horrible, dude. So. So when I got out of juvenile program, like I said, 17, I had to go to a level 2 school where they drug test you, where if you don't go to school for three days, they put out a warrant for your arrest and send you to the juvenile detention center. And then the school will pick you up from the juvenile detention center. So it was that kind of school. Like, everybody was either just getting out of a program or, like, punched their teacher in the face at their normal school.

And she went in and when she came out, his lawyer said she got five years, 60. And he was like, we're both equally responsible. Nobody ever said, one of them was the ring leader. We both played for 15 years, right? Oh, my god, I'm gonna get five years. That's great. He goes in, they said, do you have anything to say? No, I'm good. Everybody says nothing, nothing. Well, the judge says, well, after you getting your wife involved in this whole scam and you teaching her how to make and the abuse, apparently when his wife went in, she got up, I met him. He was doing, he got me hooked on, he totally got me into everything. It was all his fault. I never wanted to do it. I begged and pleaded for him not to do it. I had nothing to do with. I, I don't know why I'm even on the diamond. Just complete, completely cried and begged and pleaded. The judge was like, I can't believe that man LED you down this path and gave her five years. And then he got on and gave him 25 years, gave him the extra 10 he didn't give her. So when he. Gets sentenced, the judge is like, you have anything to say? No judge goes, okay, well I'm gonna give you 300 months and he's like, okay and he gets 300 months and he thinks he is okay, 300 months okay. So his lawyer, he said, I remember my lawyer looking at me going, you okay? And he goes, yeah, I'm fine, that's fine. He's, I mean, I expected it. I expected the 300 months. The lawyers always like, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, don't make me work. They put the cuss on him. The Marshall does walk him back to the Marshall hold over, go inside. He sits down like guys are sitting there staring at you. Everybody that walked in after sentencing like what you get? And he goes, uh, he goes 300 months. They're like 300 months? He's like, yeah, I expected 15 years so you know, I'm okay with it. So I mean, I know I was gonna do 15 and they're like, no bro, 300 months they go, that's not 15 years that would be 180 months. 300 months is 25 years. He goes, no, he goes, it's not 25 years. I signed for 15 years my wife and I did. They go, bro, I don't know what you're thinking.

He would then call the person who had opened up the bank account and say, go in the bank and try and get out $200. So they would walk in the bank and they say, hey, I need to get out $200. The teller would pull up their account and say, you have, like, whatever, $12 in the account. And they'd say, what are you talking about? I have $10,000 in that account. They do?

Okay, we're gonna return your money. They return the $10,000. They would then take the money out and close the account.

Fresh out of the shower and thinking only about her upcoming date, she had no idea the danger waiting for her. It wasn't until she squeezed the toothpaste and put the brush into her mouth that everything went horribly wrong. The bristles dissolved instantly. And even worse, her teeth began to loosen and fall out one by one, scattering across the floor like pieces in a horror film. At that exact moment, the doorbell rang. Her boyfriend was here to pick her up. She couldn't possibly let him see her toothless. He would surely leave her exactly what her sister wanted. She rushed back into the bathroom and spotted the applicator of the corrosive agent lying on the sink, unmistakably her sister's doing. She was about to grab it when something caught her eye, her freshly painted white gel nails. A spark of inspiration hit her. The pure white nail tips. If she placed them in her mouth, they could pass as temporary teeth. Perfect improvised solution. She tried it immediately and for a moment it worked until she smiled. The fake nail teeth fell right out again. Without gums to hold them, they were far too loose. Thinking about gums reminded her of someone, their toothless elderly neighbor. Her dentures could be the perfect substitute. And luckily, the old woman was probably fast asleep. He climbed through the neighbor's window and reached for The dentures. But the woman woke up and caught her red handed. Terrified, she begged for forgiveness and confessed everything. To her surprise, the old woman not only sympathized with her, but opened a precious box, a collection of her past dentures, and offered her a choice. Meanwhile, her scheming sister was.

It was a strange ritual she never understood. Not until the day Charlie noticed the clusters of blemishes scattered across her sister's face. Press a finger onto one pimple and the imperfections sank into the skin as if swallowed, then slid down the shared braid like something alive, finally crawling onto her own face and embedding itself into her skin. Terror gripped her completely at the same time, Charlie pulled back the sheets and was stunned to see her sister's thighs coated in greasy fat, her feet ravaged by fungal infection. Mortified beyond belief, the twin pressed both hands against her thighs and shove, forcing the fat upward like a thick fluid. Then she yanked her belt and the excess fat was drawn through the braid, spilling directly into her abdomen and legs. She witnessed every horrifying moment, unable to intervene. Worse still, her sister pressed five fungus ridden nails onto her fingertips and those grotesque nails began growing on her own hands. Finally screamed, overwhelmed with terror. Even then, she realised the source of everything was the braid linking them. She grabbed Scissors to cut it, but the blades snapped instantly. She didn't panic. She snatched a lighter instead and set the braid ablaze. Flames shot several meters high, triggering the smoke alarm. Yet the sprinklers were useless against the roaring fire. Using the chaos, she ran out the door trying to wedge the burning Braid into the frame, tears streamed down her face until she spotted a fire extinguisher. A brilliant idea hit her. She sprinted back inside, saw her sister's face contorted with rage, and without hesitation unleashed a freezing blast of suppressant, ending the nightmare that bound them together.

This was a full blown criminal art project in motion. The paper sucked in the liquid like it had been thirsty for years. And when he lifted it out, the Bill had transformed from fresh off the press to spend a decade inside someone's sweaty wallet. They repeated the same ritual again and again, dunking, drying, blasting each Bill with a hair dryer like they were prepping them for a photo shoot. And why all this effort? Simple. Every single note was fake but crisp, perfect. Counterfeit money is a rookie mistake. Old, wrinkled, seen something's cash. That's how you fool people. To test their masterpiece, the brothers walked into a tiny neighborhood shop. Riley slid one of the bills across the counter like he'd done it his whole life, the shopkeeper took one glance and instantly knew something was wrong. Riley froze like a deer in headlights. Jack noticed trouble brewing and yanked him away before the man could take a second look. They vanished into the crowd, hearts pounding. Their big plan had blown up in seconds. Staring at the rejected bills, Jack finally understood they were doing everything wrong. Indian currency wasn't printed on normal paper. It used a special cotton based material that felt nothing like cheap wood pulp sheets. It even made a signature snapping sound when bent. Then there was the colour shifting. Ink, the holographic strip and the microtext that scanners could never replicate. If they wanted real premium grade counterfeits, they had to build everything from scratch. The artwork, the engravings, the plates, the chemicals, every microscopic detail. But the biggest problem, the government tightly controlled cotton based banknote paper. There was no way to buy it. So they hunted for a workaround. Days passed before Jack found a clue hidden in a random advertising booklet. Two layers of certain paper pressed together just right pretty much matched the real currency's feel and thickness. Some bleaching and custom printing, they finally had a breakthrough. And then the mob boss stepped in, handing Jack exactly what he needed to take this operation to the next level.

The massive living room was lined with bookshelves stacked high with books. Unable to contain her curiosity, she asked the owner, did you read all these books? Most of them, he replied. Why? His words struck her deeply. Knowledge could truly change someone's fate. That night when she got home, she turned off the TV, sat down and wrote out a learning plan for her children. She told them they had to finish two books each week, and on weekends, they'd write reports about what they'd read. If you spend your time developing your gifts, it won't be long before people see you on TV. Those words resonated deeply with her son, Carson. From then on, Carson stayed up late studying. But despite his relentless effort, he remained at the bottom of his class. His teacher asked how many questions he got right on the exam. He whispered, none. Laughter filled the room. Carson's head dropped in shame. Every day after school, he would avoid his classmates, too embarrassed to face their mocking eyes. The teasing never stopped. Finally, unable to bear it any longer, he snapped and got into a fight. Sent to the principal's office, he tried to explain it was an accident, but no one believed him. The principal handed his mother his report card, filled with nothing but d's and F's. He warned her that if Things didn't improve. Soon, Carson would be expelled. On the way home, Carson was overwhelmed by guilt. He promised his mother he would never fight again. But when it came to his grades, he wasn't so sure. He had already tried everything.

Just when we were about to lose all hope, she suddenly spotted a small island not far from us. We were so overjoyed, we paddled desperately toward the shore. As soon as our feet touched land, we took a deep breath of relief. After a short rest, we decided to explore the island. I grabbed a flare gun just in case. To our surprise, the island not only had fresh water, but also plenty of wild fruit. However, when we reached the highest point of the island, we discovered it was completely deserted. We decided to stay on the island for now. Eventually, I found a cave, but it was filled with bath. Panicking, we jumped into the water and fled. We had no choice but to return to the beach. That's when I realized the waves had carried our kayak away. Our only way off the island was gone. Annie sat on the sand, utterly desperate with only one life jacket left, which I picked up. We spent the rest of the afternoon on the beach watching the sun slowly set, thinking about how we could escape. As night fell, I gave her the life jacket as a pillow and I pulled out my lighter, starting a small campfire.

Whenever her boyfriend lied, bright red lines flashed above his head like warning sirens. So the moment her husband left for a business trip, she secretly arranged a date with her lover. Just as they sat down at a restaurant, he got a mysterious call, leaped from his chair and vanished, leaving her confused and alone. Wandering through the park, she suddenly spotted a familiar silhouette, her boyfriend happily strolling with a stunning young woman. Furious, she charged toward them. The pair slipped onto the Ferris wheel before she could reach them. Determined, she followed, only to be ambushed by a flock of birds. Her hair turned into a wild nest and a woodpecker jabbed her finger, sending her tumbling through the air. Before she could recover, she saw her boyfriend and the girl heading into another attraction. Fueled by anger, she stormed after them. Suddenly, the ground shook and terrified visitors ran from the dark room. She couldn't find her boyfriend among them, so she assumed he was still inside. Swallowing her fear, she stepped into the pitch black space. In the darkness, someone stomped her foot. Her boyfriend's terrified screams echoed nearby, growing louder. Just as he leaned in to kiss the other woman, she emerged from the shadows. Her disheveled, bird wrecked appearance made her look like a ghost. Both of them shrieked and bolted out of the room, her boyfriend running for his life, thinking he had just seen something supernatural.

No matter how she strained, the shoes refused to fit and raged. The man produced a pedicure kit, intent on trimming them right then. His wife was terrified. She hadn't clipped those nails in over 10 years. Fortunately, the man was surprisingly deaf. He even meticulously scrubbed the grime from between her toes, though the accumulation nearly made him wretch. Removing the callous skin from her toe crevices caused such agony she nearly fainted. Alarmed, he rushed through the rest, finishing with a disinfectant spray. They'll fit now, he assured himself. Yet the moment she slid her feet in, she cried out in pain. The crystal shoes were too narrow, her feet too broad. Still, the man forced them onto her feet, yanked her up and compelled her to dance within steps. Her feet swelled like overfilled balloons. The man showed no mercy until his own foot struck the top of hers. Unable to endure another second, she shoved him away, violently kicked off the crystal shoes and gasped in relief. Seeing Fury darken his face, she stripped off her wedding ring, marched over, hurled it at him and walked away head high. After all, only the foot within the shoe knows where it pinches.

Two soldiers stood rooted on their own soil, eyes locked, each wary that the other might take a single forbidden step forward. Then a summer breeze carried a lone leaf across the line innocently over the border. Bearded soldier reacted, his blade fearing the leaf where he casually tossed it back as if nothing had disturbed the silent at all. Men resumed their rigid patrol, but the heat was merciless that before long couldn't bear it anymore and crack open an ice cold Cola. Drinking Gretel got the glance from the bearded guard, quickly pulled out another bottle, tending to share. The real problem was how to deliver it. Neither one was allowed to cross the boundary, even by an inch. The bearded man scanned the surroundings. No officers, no witnesses, but rules were rules. Just then came up with a plan and set the soda on the ground. The bearded man thinking a confrontation was coming until Jake drew a rough circle around the bottle with his knife. Realization flashed across the bearded man. He brushed away part of the straight border line with his pouch, slowly picked up Cola. Moments later, the two of them were drinking together like unlikely comrades, sharing a rare moment. But as soon as the last drop slid down there, their expressions hardened. Once more, men step back into position, guardians of their own nation again. The bearded soldier quietly redrew the border, erasing every trace. Of that.

While moss smeared concrete ultimately betrayed her stride, plunging her form into the desolate concrete reservoir beneath the scorching afternoon sun's relentless glare. Jack had pursued solitary refreshment in these troubled waters. The horrifying realization struck him during his descent. Not a single egress marked the curved blue boundaries. His crimson handprints painted relentless struggling pattern upon the impeccably glazed aquatic containment walls. Within this all consuming vacuum of absolutes, he persistently nurtured fantasies of Sweetheart's deliverance, never envisioning this terrifyingly compounded captivity situation. Jack carefully settled the injured anew on the final airbed, transforming submerged bathrobes into emergency medical dressing. His abraded vocal cords pleaded hopelessly into nothingness as shredded promotional pennants conversed with evening's effort. When the Indigo Knight shroud fully descended, completely fresh horror manifested through grating physical friction, reptilian scales rasping against eroded concrete surfaces. The primordial saurian shadow pierced the tenuous watery depths.

A full beard covered my face. I dashed into the restroom, slathered soap over my jaw, and shaved it all off. Yet unbelievably, the beard grew back instantly, thicker and coarser than ever. I was on the edge of panic and I noticed the same woman surreptitiously snapping photos of me and uploading them online, where they blew up within minutes. I despised her to my core, but I felt helpless. I couldn't face anyone like this. My frenzy. I spotted a first aid kit on the wall. I grabbed a roll of gauze, determined to tear the beard out from its roots. I no longer cared about the pain. Taking a sharp breath, I pulled with every ounce of strength. Tears sprang to my eyes from the burning sting. I glanced at the mirror, only to find the beard had regenerated, now paired with a goatee. My composure shattered. I began weeping softly. But seconds later, a daring idea sparked in my mind. Energy surged through me. I peeked out cautiously and noticed a man's coat hanging nearby. I threw it on, disguised myself deftly, and strode confidently toward the woman. I pretended to be smitten at first sight, flashing Her a suggestive wink! She blushed instantly

He always carried a small ball in his hand, throwing it at a spot where it would bounce off all four walls before perfectly returning to his hand. Once, without even looking, he hit a bird with that same ball. Even a small nail in his hand could become a dead deadly weapon. Because of his sharp skills, a police officer offered him a dangerous mission. If he completed it, his prison sentence would be reduced by 15 years. Without thinking twice, the prisoner agreed. But to ensure he didn't escape, they implanted a chemical bomb in his neck. When they arrived at the mission site, a special team was waiting for him. The team was made up of strange individual, one of whom looked like a wolf, clearly not human. Soon the military put them all on a plane and just before the mission began, the final member joined them. On the way, everyone joked around except for the long haired man, who remained silent in a corner, waiting to reach the target zone. When two members jumped into the water, he followed them and the rest jumped in too. But no one realized that the wolf like man couldn't swim. He sank straight down, causing panic, but the long haired man quickly dove in and pulled him to the shore.

She always walked with her head down. Her behavior was almost like Samara climbing out of a TV screen. Her classmates saw her as some kind of monster because of it. Until the day the new school year began, the girl met the boy who would end up changing her life. Jenny noticed a student heading the wrong direction at an intersection, so she told the boy the right way to get to school. Surprised Jenny, Jack didn't step back because of how she looked. Instead, he walked toward her with a warm smile. When Jenny saw Jack's smile, her heart began to race, but she still didn't dare say much. At that moment, cherry blossoms drifted down from above. A few petals landed on Jenny's head. Jack gently brushed them away for her. For the first. First time in her life, someone approached her on their own. Jenny looked at Jack curiosity, and after seeing that smile again, all her fears seemed to melt away. But Jenny told herself it must be an illusion because nobody would ever like her. What Jenny didn't know was that her story with Jack was only just beginning. After school officially started, they ended up in the same class. Jenny often saw Jack smiling at school, and she couldn't help glancing at. Like most girls, Jenny quickly fell for Jack. But she knew they came from different worlds. Jack was always surrounded by Noise and friends. While she only belonged in the quiet corners, and because Jack was handsome, there were always plenty of girls around him. Jenny understood all of that, but she never expect Jack would secretly watch her from the classroom window. Every morning when he walked in, he would greet her. Jenny could hardly believe someone wasn't scared of her appearance and even told her good morning. But the closer Jack got, the more uneasy Jenny felt. She feared becoming the center of everyone's gossip, and was even more afraid that her appearance might scare Jack away. What Jenny didn't know was that every small good deed she quietly did, Jack noticed them all.

The girl opened the door, desperately pushing her wheelchair along the road to escape. It wasn't long before she saw a car approaching. Fearing it was her mother returning home, the girl quickly hid. Once she saw that the car wasn't her mother's, she rushed forward and stopped it, asking the man inside for help. Just as the man was about to take the girl to the police station, her mother's car appeared. Despite the woman's frantic pleas for the man to return her daughter, he insisted on taking the girl to the police. Upon hearing this, the woman stopped arguing.

Jason might look like an ordinary retiree, but he once lived the kind of life that never truly lets you go. Earlier that day, his wife picked him up at the airport, and the two walked out smiling, unaware of the storm waiting in the underground garage. That smile disappeared the moment Jason noticed their tire had been deliberately slashed. While he leaned down to check the damage, a thug stepped out and demanded half a million to let it slide. Jason's wife, frightened, tried to pay just to end the confrontation, but Jason stopped her cold and told the man to back off. Before he could finish, a brutal hit struck the back of his skull, dropping him instantly. His terrified wife tried to reach him, but the attacker blocked her, pulled a knife. I stabbed her without a second thought, then kicked Jason's unconscious body for good measure, grabbed anything valuable and walked off as though he'd stepped out of a grocery store. When Jason finally woke up, he found his wife lying in a widening pool of blood, and something inside him broke beyond repair. Three days later, after burying the love of his life, he went to the police station to identify the killer in the lineup. He recognized the man immediately, one with a small fly tattoo near the corner of his eye. The case should have been simple, but officers told him to wait outside. Then came the Part no one could have predicted. Two cops walked the killer out the door and released him on the spot. No charges, no explanation. As the man passed, he flashed Jason a cold, taunting grin, leaving Jason frozen in this.

The bizarre sight froze Anna in place, as if someone had pressed pause on her mind. Before she could react, the strange woman in the mirror suddenly began slamming against the glass as though she was desperate to force her way out. Terrified, Anna staggered backward, her breathing turning sharp and chaotic. With a piercing crash, the mirror shattered violently, filling the room with sharp echoes. Anna screamed at the top of her lungs, yet her companion beside her only stared at her strangely, as if none of the horrifying events had happened. Anna whipped her head around and looked at the mirror again to see its surface calm and intact, with no sign of the mysterious woman at all. From that moment on, strange phenomena began occurring around Anna more frequently. One day, while she was cleaning the glass, she sensed something unusual behind her. The wall was slowly leaning toward her. By the time she realized it, the wall had already crushed her tightly against the glass, compressing her chest until she could hardly breathe, a suffocating scene that would make anyone as hard clench. Just when she was about to be completely flattened, the wall quietly returned to its original shape as if nothing had ever happened. Anna did not believe it was a hallucination. She placed her hand on the wall. Then looked back at the glass and saw the clear imprint of her face left on its surface. Only then did she realise everything she experienced was real. To test whether she was trapped in a dream, Anna resorted to something extreme. She pulled out a roll of cling film and wrapped it around her face. Layer after layer, the thin plastic gradually engulfed her entire head, distorting her features as the layers tightened. Then she pulled the film taut on both sides, leaving herself no room to breathe. Soon, the suffocating pressure overwhelmed her and she was on the verge of losing consciousness. Instinctively, she clawed at the film, but it was wrapped far too tightly for her to find a gap. In desperation, she tried tearing it open with her mouth, struggling wildly as her vision dimmed. When she was finally rescued, she found herself on a crowded bus surrounded by.

The moment the train started accelerating, he and the others were violently thrown backward. But determined not to waste even a cent, the four brothers didn't hesitate for a second. They sprinted after the train with everything they had. One of them even leaped straight onto a cargo carriage in the back. Meanwhile, two escaped convicts, father and son, arrived at the railway tracks. Heavy chains were still locked around their wrists, so they came up with a bizarre plan. Place the chains beneath the rails, let the train roll over them, and use the massive shock to break the shackles. But hidden in the bushes nearby was a chubby boy, quietly watching everything unfold. He shouted at them, run away now or the law will catch you! What they didn't know was that the boy boy had buried 500 kilograms of gunpowder underneath the track, planning to detonate at the moment the train arrived. But the father and son just laughed it off, laying flat on the tracks as if nothing was wrong. Then suddenly, the father realized something terrifying. If the chain stays under the train, both of them would be dragged right along with. He quickly shifted his position, desperately trying to move away from the rails.

Afterward, he used a hair dryer to dry them off. But the moment he turned it off, his mom lost her balance and toppled straight into a cup of cream. Seeing his dad laughing at her, the boy grabbed a hair trimmer to cut his father's hair, but it was so oversized that he only managed to shave half his head. Then he noticed his mom's leg was injured, so he sprayed some medicine on her, but the spray soaked her entire tiny body. While putting the bottle back, he accidentally bumped into his dad, sending him tumbling straight into the toilet. Although he didn't want to, the boy reached in and pulled him out. After that chaotic bath, the tiny parents had to take another one. That night, they slept inside the boy's sneakers. He even snapped a photo to remember the moment. The next morning, he pulled two toys from a box, dressed his parents in the doll's clothes and prepared a breakfast of French fries for them.

Shirley felt humiliated, yet he performed flawlessly and the audience erupted with applause, astonished by his elegance and musical brilliance. But when he tried to use the restroom, the host stopped him, pointing to a shabby shed outside. That's the one meant for you. Shirley paused, then calmly replied, take me back to the hotel. The drive would take an hour. To Shirley, that wasn't just distance. It was dignity. Days later, they passed a fine suit shop. Tony thought one of the suits would fit Shirley perfectly, so they walked inside. The owner welcomed Tony warmly. But the moment he realized the suit was for Shirley, his expression hardened. He snatched the suit away and snapped, you buy it first, then you can try it. It was discrimination, blunt and shameless. Shirley gave a bitter smile and walked out. Tony wanted to fight, but there was nothing he could do. That night, Shirley let all his frustration explode through the piano. The notes were sharp, violent, almost angry. Behind them was loneliness and exhaustion. As the trip went on, Tony and Shirley grew closer. Until one rainy night, they accidentally drove into a restricted road. The police stopped them and declared colored men aren't allowed here at night. Tony argued fiercely and both ended up in jail. Shirley tried to reason, but no one cared until he made one phone call. 10 minutes later, the sheriff rushed in, ordered their release, and the officer's attitudes flipped completely. Tony stared at Shirley, stunned. For the first time, he understood this quiet, refined man wasn't alone. He had powerful connections. By the time the rain stopped, it was nearly midnight. Tony opened the Green Book again and found a motel that accepted black guests. This time, Tony chose to stay with Shirley. After everything they had faced together, he finally understood the weight of Shirley's silent loneliness. At last, they reached the final venue. The organizers treated Shirley like royalty, even giving him a VIP parking space. But then they guided him through a back door to a storage room beside the kitchen, cramped, greasy, barely habitable. Shirley smiled politely, not a single complaint. But when he tried to dine in the main restaurant, they stopped him again. Black guests weren't allowed. They suggested a roadside diner instead, and that was the breaking point. Shirley refused to perform. The organizer panicked and pulled out his wallet, offering Tony $100 to persuade him. Tony pushed the money away, furious, and walked out with Shirley without hesitation. They later found a small roadside restaurant. Despite their sophisticated clothes, No one stared, no one judged. On the stage sat an old, battered piano, nothing like the Steinway he deserved. Yet Shirley sat down anyway. The local musicians joined in, and for the first time in a long time, Shirley played with soul, wild, free and alive. A genuine smile finally appeared on his face.

Every eye watched tensely, knowing this wall alone could not stop the fiery search. The team had prepared fully in advance. Their plan was that as soon as the lava hit the barrier, helicopters and fire trucks would douse it with torrents of seawater to cool it down and halt its flow. But they could not anticipate the lava speed. Within a single minute, it reached the wall and began surging upward, glowing and crackling. The fire trucks had to retreat as the heat became unbearable. The situation grew even more critical. Yet the team hesitated to release water because the helicopters had not arrived and the limited truck supply was insufficient. Then the roar of helicopters filled the sky. They unleashed heavy showers of seawater. And as the cold water struck the boiling magma, sparks erupted and thick smoke spread across the city. The entire area was instantly shrouded in mist and scalding steam. Within a short while, the smoke began to clear and everyone realized they had succeeded. People cheered with relief and joy as the city had been saved. Meanwhile, Amy descended into the underground tunnels to inspect where smoke and extreme heat filled every corner. Instruments showed temperatures soaring above 500 degrees and danger remained intense and unrelenting.

They were in a dangerous neighborhood, a territory controlled by gangs and violence. Mike stepped out alone and walked toward the rundown house where his mother once lived. But when he arrived, he found the house already taken back by the landlord. In that silent, heavy moment, he finally understood he no longer had a place he could call home. When he returned empty handed, Lee and didn't need an explanation. Without a word, she drove him to a plus size clothing store. But the moment Mike saw the prices, he quietly shook his head and picked the cheapest item he could find. That night, Leon asked gently whether he wanted to stay and live with them. I don't want to go any place else, he whispered. That answer made her smile, a soft aching smile full of compassion. The next morning, she prepared a room just, just for him and bought a bed big enough to fit his massive frame. Mike said no one had ever done something like that, not for him. Even having a bed felt like something only rich kids had. Lee and turned away before tears could spill. Her heartbreaking as she imagined the life he survived. News spread quickly in high society. A wealthy white woman had taken in a black teenage boy. Some people mocked her, claiming Mike would ruin her family and even Suggested he might be a danger to her daughter. Shame on you, Lee, and replied with cold certainty. On the way home, she asked her daughter what she thought. The girl answered without hesitation. She couldn't stand the idea of Mike having nowhere to live and her little brother felt safer with him around. Slowly, the white students at school began to accept Mike. His new sister noticed everything. One day they crossed paths in the library. Mike tried to walk away, afraid he'd embarrass her, but she got up and sat right next to him without hesitation. For Mike, it was the first time he felt like he belonged. Later, during basketball practice, his huge body and surprisingly agile movements caught attention. From a distance, the football coach watched in disbelief. This boy had raw, rare potential. He convinced the school to put Mike on the football team. Training started fast, but Mike didn't understand a single rule. Sometimes he flattened opponents. Sometimes he literally picked them up and ran with them. And other times just stood still, staring at balloons floating far above the stadium. An entire morning of practice felt hopeless. The coach couldn't understand. Kids with harsh past usually carried anger, yet Mike seemed terrified of hurting anyone. To help him unlock his strength, his adopted brother built a customized training plan. All summer long, they trained sprinting, strength tactics and endurance. With constant support and encouragement, Mike began to change every single day. One afternoon Mike told Leanne he wanted to get his driver's license. She raised a brow. But you don't even have a car. Mike explained he didn't want a vehicle, he just wanted proof he existed. The next day, Lee and visited the police department. They told her a simple form would make her his legal guardian, but she wanted something more important, his biological mother's permission. After a long search, she finally found her. At first, the woman was defensive and distant. But when she understood why Leon was there, she straightened her clothes, her wig, as if reclaiming the dignity life stole from her. Hearing that Mike was loved and cared for, her eyes filled with tears, mix of relief, regret and painful gratitude. Lee and gently held her hand, offering comfort that words couldn't. After a long pause, the woman recalled Mike's last name. That was all she could give her son. During a family meal, they finally asked Mike if he wanted to officially join the family. Everyone waited, holding their breath. Soon after, Mike passed his driving test. The first time in 16 years he had a document that proved he exists. And the best part, the family had a surprise waiting for him. Not a big car, but a stylish, cool little one that felt absolutely perfect. Mike smiled, a bright, genuine smile. A new chapter had begun.

Hunger gnawed at everyone, the smell of scorched food filling the station. The captain considered ordering takeout, but the dreaded alarm sounded again. A woman's face had been ensnared by an octopus. I plunged it into water, and it slipped off her face. From then on, the alarms barely paused.

With the gentle encouragement of Missus Peg, he slowly spread butter on the bread, finally tasting the flavor of food. His father had wanted to give him real hands, but suddenly passed away from overwork, and even the fake hands broke. All he had wanted was to touch his father's face, but accidentally left a scratch. From that day on, he lived alone in a dark, empty mansion until Missus Peg unexpectedly appeared. Upon first seeing him, she showed no fear, only warmth and kindness.

Presented with such a chance, he accepted without hesitation. The warden then turned him over to Mike's former trainer. After an intense round of preparation, race day finally arrived.

Frantically, I tried to fix the melting makeup, but it only worsened. Even I couldn't stand my reflection. Tears welled in my eyes. I used a hair dryer to dry it, but the mask melted faster.

With so many beauties around him, I was just average. Now, unexpectedly, my crush approached me. To my astonishment, he gently cupped my face. I thought destiny had arrived. He removed his own mask. It was all a scheme by the face shop owner. He did all this just to copy my face.

I was cleaning a pool that had been shut down for years. That's when I noticed the drain was blocked by something unknown. I reached inside to check and something sharp sliced my hand open. Moments later, thick black water burst out of the pipe, carrying a horrible stench. We called in a specialist and he discovered an old well right beside the pool. Turns out the builders had accidentally connected the pool to an underground water source. The expert assured us it would be fine after proper disinfection, even bragging that the groundwater was good for the skin. My family was thrilled. Week later, the pool was finally ready and that's when the strange events started. One afternoon, my son was splashing around in the water when he saw a coin drop from above. He thought I was teasing him, but no one was anywhere near the pool. He dove again and another coin sank down, finally settling near a drain. As he reached for it, a girl's silhouette appeared on the water surface. He swam toward it, but the shape vanished instantly. Thinking it was his sister messing with him, he dived again and the figure showed up once more. Terrified, he tried to get out of the pool when a faint voice echoed from the water intake. He followed the sound and saw someone trapped inside.

I had been fighting to stay alive in that lake for three endless days. With the slightest pull, huge pieces of my skin tore away from my body. Even the flesh on my back began peeling off and grew some sheets. When I finally broke through the surface, I vomited uncontrollably. My wife was terrified the moment she saw me. While cleaning the bathroom, she quietly swab some of my blood and sealed it in a small container. The next morning, Abigail placed the sample under a microscope and discovered that my blood was undergoing a strange, unstable mutation. That afternoon, things escalated. Both of my eyes suddenly ruptured, flooding my face with blood. Abigail raced me into emergency surgery. And when I came back out, my vision had somehow returned, but my skin had turned ghost white. Seeing her husband transformed into a creature she barely recognized, Abigail fell apart. She went straight to the professor in charge of the human experiments and demanded the truth. But he brushed her off with a few vague excuses. Determined to uncover what was really happening, she took my key card and used it to slip into the laboratory. She crept into the the professor's private office. The moment she saw the documents spread across his desk, she froze. Those reports were filled with disturbing research on splicing human DNA with animals.

For a moment, everything worked flawlessly. But the roaring mega wave was already crashing board. The helicopter had no chance to outrun it, and went down into the towering surge, lunged at the spacecraft like a monstrous jaw, and before it could truly lift off, vanished beneath raging sea. When despair was about to consume the crew, the spacecraft suddenly burst free from the depth, rising like the final lifeline of humanity. But as it climbed toward the shrouded sky, the quake damage booster began to malfunction. He knew that dragging a crippled booster any fart would eventually doom the entire craft. Luckily, the moon was drift closer to earth, giving them just enough fuel margin to slip into orbit. So he jettisoned the faulty booster without a second thought. Soon, the main tank sputtered out as well, but by then the craft had already cut through the atmosphere. Once in lower orbit, they steered toward the orbital refueling station. When they finally reached the marked coordinate, he and the crew suited up, ready to replenish the ship's lifeblood in open space.

As the temperature warmed up, the insect eggs hatched quickly, turning into buzzing little flies. The penguin picked up a magnifying glass to get a closer look, only to discover that the flies actually thought he was their mom. So the penguin fed them syrup and the flies instantly grew bigger. They were on steroid. Later, the penguin hurried to an ice hole to go fishing. Just when he was about to hook the flies as bait, they suddenly looked heartbroken. They told him they couldn't bear to leave him. The penguin was moved deeply, so he decided to return them to the store since the seller promised there were free exchange. Next, the penguin received a tiny fish, but that fish had an audit and complained that it wasn't bait material. According to the store rules, every return meant the replacement would be bigger. So the penguin sent the small fish back and received a bigger one. But right when he was about to cook it, he remembered some experts saying that ribbon fish tasted way better. So he returned the red fish, ordered ribbon fish instead. And like that, the penguin kept exchanging fish again and again and again. Eventually, the seller had enough and stopped shipping him any. The penguin fell into a deep sadness. Just then, someone knocked on his door. He opened it and was shocked to see the four flies standing there. Seeing how upset he Was they decided to help. The flies flew to the ice hole and started mocking the fish, sh insulting them nonstop. Shockingly, a bunch of fish couldn't take the trash talk and jumped onto the shore. And from that day forward, the penguin never had to worry about food again.

When it was time to check out, he would pull a thick pile of coupons from his pocket.

But the second doctor said the test had to be repeated and would cost more than $15. Spending that much felt unbearable to him, so he returned to the first hospital. Because of this delay, the doctor said the tumor had grown and he had only 10 days left to live. The news shattered him completely. He sat by his parents graves, pouring out all his sorrow. The next day, he withdrew all his savings. And took his old buddies to the most luxurious hotel in town. They feasted on dishes he had never even seen before. Then he spent $1,000 renting a sports car and bought so many arcade tokens that they filled an entire game hall.

When she stepped forward to demand why he had not returned home for five years, her husband claimed he did not know her. Before she could react, her sister shoved her to the ground. Her daughter rushed to help, but they were caught in a car accident. When the woman woke up again, she realized she had gone back five years in time. At that moment, her husband's younger brother entered and explained that the husband had gone missing in a plane crash. He comforted her, telling her not to be too distressed. Yet remembering everything that had happened to her and her daughter in her previous life, she resolved to leave the city before her husband returned. Five years passed in the blink of an eye with only one month remaining until the day her husband had appeared in her past life. So she took her daughter to bid farewell to her husband's younger brother, but the nurse informed them that an emergency patient had arrived at the hospital entrance. Having been the hospital's top doctor, she rushed over to assess the situation. She never expected the patient to be her own sister and that her husband would arrive earlier than before. The man begged her to save his girlfriend, but the woman, terrified, refused to operate on her sister just as the man was about to condemn her, his younger brother. Asked him where he had been for the past five years. Then the younger brother revealed a photograph of him and the woman, reminding the man that she had always been his wife. The man was stunned on the spot, yet still refused to acknowledge that he was her husband. Finally, the woman performed the surgery on her sister. After her sister was saved, she became smug, while the man.

Her belly swelled up like she was pregnant. Then suddenly, police sirens blared outside. She woke up and asked him what was going on. Why were so many cops outside? He claimed they were after him, but he was being framed. The police accused him of stealing jewels worth billions. She immediately denied it, saying they were poor. The cramped, tiny home, if they didn't believe her, they could search. The officers took out a metal detector and began scanning her husband's body. He insisted he was innocent. The officer said to wait until the skin test was done. Her husband grew anxious as the alarm went off. She showed them her tongue piercing. Then the alarm went off again, this time over her stomach. Her husband quickly showed them an old X ray, claiming she had titanium implants from a car accident. The cops bought his story. After they left, she confronted her husband. She had never been in a car accident nor had any implants. Just then, a sharp pain hit her stomach. She thought it was just a stomach ache and said she needed to go to the bathroom. But he stopped her, warning her not to be careless. He knew a famous doctor who could check her properly. He then made a video call. The doctor claimed she thought she was pregnant. She was overjoyed. They'd wanted a baby for so long, married for years. But unable to conceive, she'd even prepared baby clothes for years. Finally, they would be put to use. Her husband asked when she could be checked. The doctor told him she needed to come in quickly and not use the bathroom before that. Just then, her stomach hurt again. He gave her some water to drink, claiming it would help with the bloating, according to the doctor. Trusting him, she drank it and passed out. She woke up on an operating table. The doctor and her husband clearly had a shady connection. He was already picking out luxury cars and urged the doctor to cut her open. But when she made the first incision, the stomach popped like a balloon. They were stunned. The person on the table wasn't her, but an inflatable dummy. Only then did they realize they'd been duped. She later discovered the woman was her husband's mistress, who had claimed she was pregnant without any real exam. Feeling suspicious, she went to a rail hospital where doctors found jewels inside her. She contacted the police and returned the jewels to their rightful owner. The wealthy man generously gave her $10 million. She donated all of it to charity because wealth that can be lost isn't true wealth. Never cling to what isn't rightfully yours.

Though she came from a powerful, wealthy family, he couldn't afford a divorce. Instead, he shut her out. Cold stairs. Silent treat. He even told Kasha she should get used to it and be grateful. Kasha thought this was the way her life would always be. Lonely and ignore. But one day, Jack casually mentioned to his father that he planned to take his wife on a trip abroad. Asha was genuinely excited. But when Jack secretly pulled her aside, his words shattered, he told her to leave quietly before the flight took off. It turned out Jack had never planned a vacation with her. He just needed to keep up appearances. Broken, Asha began drafting divorce papers. But before she could confront Jack, her mother in law handed her a red envelope. The next day, Asha felt a flicker of warmth. Her in laws had always treated her kindly, and this gesture made her reconsider. She made a decision. Jack didn't want her on the trip. She'd go on her own terms. At the airport, she didn't sneak away like Jack had expected. Instead, she confidently boarded the same plane as her husband. By morning, they were heading to the hotel Jack had booked, and Asha was ready to take in the beauty of Europe. But Jack had other plans. He booked a hotel room with twin bed and warned Her not to get any inappropriate idea. Feeling helpless, Ashea realized that no matter how beautiful or charming she was, none of it mattered to her husband. During dinner, she invited him to go shopping, but while waiting for the car, Jack left early, showing no interest in accompanying. Even without her husband, Asha kept a smile on her face. Jack, on the other hand, was busy trying on clothes, clearly more interested in his outfit than his wife. But the Parisian tops were expensive, and the cash he'd brought wasn't enough, so he returned to the hotel, planning to ask his wife for some money. Asha, however, was out, and when Jack saw the souvenirs on the bed, finally realized the truth. His wife was quietly wealthy all along.

Peg rushed over, untangling him patient hands and helping him change into fresh clothes. But not everyone welcomed a peculiar newcomer. To help him look more ordinary, peg brought out her cosmetics.

To his astonishment, the underwater world came into focus like a perfectly cleaned window. A laugh slipped out of being able to see clearly beneath the surface meant finally had a real chance at survival. Armed with his handmade spear, he he dove deeper, hoping to snag a large fish to quiet his starving stomach. But as he swam farther, a small sunken boat resting on the seafloor stole all his attention. Fishing instantly became meaningless. Tossed the spear aside and tried with all his strength to wreck. But despair hit hard when he noticed a massive horn through the body. It looked beyond saving. Just as he was about to give up, spark of inspiration hit him. He hurled the spear onto the wreck, removed his mask and gently placed it inside the cabin. Then he grabbed a rope, risking drowning with every second, dragged the wreck seafloor. The boat's weight brushed his body with each step. When his lungs screamed for air, he abandoned the rope and rocketed up, gasping wild. Yet he refused. To quit, with another deep breath, he dove again, hauling the wreck inch by inch toward the shore. Hours of agony later, finally dragged the boat out of the ocean and onto the sand. His companions rushed over, but even on the verge of collapsing, he blocked them from coming near, pointed angrily at Jack, who tried to help, and shot a distrustful look at his wife, unable to believe they truly meant to assist. Dragging the wreck ashore of the beach, he scavenged whatever materials he could find and began patching the hull. But the damage was overwhelming. The next morning, he covered the gaping hole with scavenged plastic boards and even crafted a makeshift sail that could hold and unfurl. He was shocked a battered vessel actually moved.

The crowd turned their heads in disbelief, yet he never touched the brakes. Instead, he pushed the accelerator to the floor.

The girl collapsed in terror, fainting. With trembling hands, the manicurist grasped her tweezers, her face alight with a gleam of eager excitement. She delicately lifted the long nail, but it shattered into dust. An instant, it was revealed the girl was, in fact, an elderly woman. Her nails decayed from the ravages of time. Furious, the manicurist slammed a button. The woman thought she had been spared, but instead she plunged into a hidden cellar below. Then the manicurist turned to the second girl's nail, chopping them off with a swift, brutal motion. The girl, terrified, her eyes brimming with tears, feared her nails might not meet the expected standard. However, the manicurist seemed quite pleased with herself. She dropped the nails into a grinder, crushing them into a fine powder, retracing the faint traces of red polish left behind. With a strainer, she sifted the mixture over and over, expertly separating the nail dust from the polish remnants. Girl's chin quivered as she anxiously watched the process unfold. The manicurist ignited an alcohol burner, pouring the nail powder into a pot to heat it up. She added borax and with a secondary extraction technique, managed to isolate rare earth elements from the concoction. Her hands trembled with excitement as she meticulously worked like a scientist preparing a delicate experiment. But no, it wasn't a missile she was building, but rather she drew the nail liquid into a syringe, injecting it into A nail mold. With a blow dryer, she carefully set the shape and soon the nail gleamed with an astonishing shine. Picking one up, she struck it with a hammer and it shattered into pieces. Beneath the girl's polished exterior lay brittle nails, fragile and bloodstained. She had failed the test. The manicurist's face twisted in disappointment. Predictably, the second girl, too, fell into the cellar. Picking up her act again, the manicurist prepared to continue her work.

The boss was very pleased with the first batch of hair and immediately paid that stylist $10,000. She was absolutely thrilled. Then the boss picked up the cross dressing man's wig, and I looked at it with disgust, tossing it back at him. When it came to my hair, it broke as soon as she pulled it. The quality was horrendous. The boss disdainfully threw me a single coin that was far too little, especially when I handed it to my boyfriend, who looked utterly repulsed, abandoned me, and drove off without a second glance. Just as my heart sank, I suddenly noticed a hair salon nearby. I walked straight in, asking the owner to make me a beautiful wig. The owner first cleaned my bald head, then squeezed out all the pimples, and after a series of treatments, my scalp was instantly smooth and shiny. She then noticed the psoriasis on my neck, paused for a moment, and decided to use a crowbar to deal with it. Unexpectedly, the results were better than any cosmetic treatment I'd ever had. Next came the hairstyle selection process. But looking at the two options, I wasn't satisfied with either. I wanted long Beautiful hair! The owner immediately understood what I meant, but unfortunately she didn't have any long hair in stock, so she decided to make some right on the spot.

But what happened next turned my stomach. Her mother handed me a suitcase full of cash just to ensure a handsome grandson. However, when I entered the room, I was horrified. Her legs were covered in black hair. Her face was full of acne scars and her toenails were long and yellow like claws. Her feet emitted a green disgust sting stench that nearly made me vomit. I couldn't go through with it. When I tried to back out, her mother doubled the payment. The sum was impossible to refuse, but I still couldn't bring myself to touch her. So I took a handful of antiemetic, hoping it would ease the discomfort. But it made things worse. My face swelled up like a balloon and my body was covered in painful red sores, making me look like a monster. That's when I came up with a clever yet sinister plan. I saw the handsome gardener outside and decided to subcontract the job. I threatened him, saying I would accuse him of theft if he didn't comply. That night, I turned off all the lights and sent the gardener into the room in my place. The plan, work. Weeks later, she was pregnant. Her mother was ecstatic and quickly paid the fee. But just as I was about to leave, my client suddenly exposed me. She recognized the scar behind my ear as evidence Of plastic surgery. Furious, she feared that her grandson would inherit my imperfect gene. Then the child was born and it was not what she expected. The angry grandmother cut ties on the spot through the check in front of her and told her to leave. But the final twist was the most shocking. My client looked at me and confessed she had known from the start that the baby had been switched. The biological father of the child was the gardener, the man she truly loved. It turned out she had spent years hiding her beauty just to discourage suitors, but her mother had relentlessly pressured her. When she finally saw her true reflection in the mirror, she was stunned. She realized she was a rare beauty beyond compare.

Tears ran down her face. She explained her allergy to seawater. The man felt a deep sense of compassion for her, but inspiration struck him quickly. He decided to scrape the hair off her legs with coral, then press each swelling until it popped. My god! The process was strangely cathartic. By then, her rash had taken on a fluorescent glow, and the woman screamed in agony. The man knew he had to act immediately. After hesitating for only a second, he suddenly remembered something, a video he had seen about clamshell. God, that clam turned out to be a wonderful tool. The satisfying snap of the lumps bursting was absolutely gratifying. When the man finished the procedure, he was stunned to see the reaction of the wounds at that critical moment. They swelled even more and turned even redder, and a mass of seaweed floated to the surface, quickly covering her entire body. Three hours later, he tried to remove the seaweed, but it had firmly adhered to her skin. Using all his strength, he finally managed to peel it off, only to discover a considerable build up of excess fat. However, this did not deter him. He dove straight into the water, while the woman feared that he might find her repulsive. Instead, he quickly captured a starfish. The Group decided to let the starfish perform a liposuction procedure. My god! The results were absolutely astonishing. The starfish were well fed. And you could say that this situation turned out to be a win win for everyone. The woman was completely impressed by the man's abilities. Just then, he accidentally pushed her, creating a moment of discomfort. And to make matters worse, the hair on her leg had already grown back. Not knowing what to do, the man came up with a permanent solution. He wove the hair on her legs into stocking. Now she even saved money on sock. What a brilliant idea!

Every time I started dating someone, she quietly sabotaged it, stealthily stealing my boyfriend's watch or jewelry. And more awkwardly, my boyfriend couldn't hold it when nature called. And she always seemed to succeed at the most inconvenient moment. What made things worse was the fatal flaw in our bond. We shared everything we ate. One time my boyfriend tried to feed me steak, but I refused since I was dieting. So he turned and fed it to my sister under the table. She swallowed it in one bite, then tossed the braid and a steak traveled right into my body. I let out an awkward burp, not wanting to waste food. Then my boyfriend handed all the leftovers to my sister, and she happily gobbled it all up for me, the dieter. All that food ended up in my stomach. My boyfriend stared in shock while my sister smirked mischievously. Then when he wasn't looking, he quietly stole the jewelry he was wearing, transferring it straight into my mouth through our connected braid. I was horrified, but she never seemed to tire of her game. While shopping with my boyfriend, my sister took a liking to some jewelry in a store. I had to drag her away, pulling her with our braids. What hurt the most was the growing suspicion that my sister and my boyfriend were Secretly involved, especially after what happened in the fitting room, which confirmed all my worst fears. In a fit of rage, I grabbed my boyfriend's clothes, yanked hard and severed the braid that connected me to my sister, quietly slipping away from all the drama. As for my ex, he laughed as he was wrapped in a curtain. After all, my sister and I could always rebraid our hair later. Now it was time to start looking for the next one.

Limping, I made my way to an alley, and near my ear, a small door slowly opened, from which a rope shot out and a tiny alien descended along it. That was our switch, and we were getting ready for repair. Beneath my human appearance lies a highly complex control system covering my limbs and every part of my body. My name is Dave, and our main mission is to gather water. The water collection sphere was lost at that moment. Lucy saw me and felt guilty, so she invited me to her home. I quickly told the repair team to return and headed to her place. At her house, I drank a glass of water, but the water spilled throughout my body, creating problems for my teammates inside. I even downed an entire bottle of ketchup in one go.

I chose a dress and stepped into the fitting room, dragging my sister, of course, because we were permanently attached like an unfortunate two headed octopus. As I was pulling the curtain closed, my boyfriend cleared his throat. I'll wait outside. But the moment I lifted my shirt to try the new outfit, I felt a suspicious tug on our braids, my sister's signal for trouble incoming. Before I could react, she suddenly yanked me backward, almost knocking me into the mirror. Then horror. She leaned toward the curtain and whispered, come in, and he did. My heart nearly exploded. My boyfriend slipped inside with the subtlety of a burglar, holding a necklace he'd picked out for me. But instead of handing it to me like a normal human, he reached past me straight toward my sister. She smiled at him like she'd been waiting her whole life for this exact moment. I stared frozen, caught between jealousy and rage. The worst part, before I could say a word, she leaned forward with dramatic flare and using our cursed braids like a conveyor belt, sent the necklace sliding into my mouth. I gagged so hard I nearly swallowed the entire pendant. My boyfriend blinked at me in confusion. My sister blinked at him in triumph. And I blinked at both of them, wondering how my life turned into this living soap opera. When he finally left the fitting room, I spun toward her. What are you doing? She just shrugged. Then she smirked with that same infuriating, mischievous look and whispered, I'm protecting you from him. That was the moment I realized my sister wasn't just sabotaging my relationships out of jealousy or boredom. No, she had her own plan. And I had no idea how terrifying it was until the night she tried to cut our braids and tie them to someone else.

Throwing herself against the glass, she banged and screamed, but the reinforced window barely budged the creature through. Anca moved closer, tilting her head unnaturally, bearing with a horrifying mix of human and insect like intent. Suddenly the worm's body expanded beneath Anca skin, causing her limbs to convulse violently. Jenny stumbled backward, knocking over a tray of lab chemicals. The liquid spilled across the floor, hissing as it met the floor, the sharp smell of awkward fumes filling the room. Anca screamed, not with her voice, but something that sounded like a chorus of insects. Jenny realized she had only one chance. She had to sever the worm's connection to Anca before it fully took control. Grabbing a metal scalpel from the counter, she steeled herself. Heart pounding, she stepped closer, knowing one wrong move could mean death or worse for both her and Anca.

A shiver ran down my spine. But what really made my heart skip a beat was the shadow in the corner of the bathroom. My son was standing there, but his eyes, they weren't innocent. They glowed faintly in the dim morning light. And a strange, knowing smile curled on his lips. Mom, he whispered. Why do you hide from me? I froze, gripping the edge of the tub. I, I'm not hiding, honey. My voice trembled. He tilted his head unnaturally. You don't understand. I've been waiting, watching, learning. Before I could react, he slipped into the tub with me, the water instantly turning icy. I felt a weight pressing me down, but it wasn't him, with something else, something that made the very air feel heavy. I looked up, and for a fleeting moment, his face flickered back and forth between the child I knew and a grown man's face with eyes full of cunning malice. You can't keep secrets from me, mom, he hissed. Voice layered with my son and someone else. Then, just as suddenly as it started, he was gone. The water drained itself, and my son stood at the doorway, smiling innocently again like nothing had happened. My heart pounded. I knew this wasn't over. He was hiding something inside him, something older, something dangerous. And I didn't know if my family would survive the night.

After all, he had already performed emergency coral surgery, clamshell extraction, and starfish powered liposuction. A poke wasn't going to shatter his dignity now.

Then front oil whispered, horrified, wait, are they going to get addicted and come back for more? As if answering her question, dozens of starfish suddenly floated to the surface, all staring at her with unblinking enthusiasm. The man's eyes widened. Run! Front oil shrieked and sprinted down the beach. The man grabbed his improvised surgical tool kit and charged after her. Yeah! Yelling, don't stop! If they catch you, they'll turn you into a snack bar! Behind them, the starfish army flopped across the sand with terrifying determination. And just when They thought they had escaped. A massive shadow rose from the water. A giant starfish. 10 times bigger than the others. Its eyes locked onto front oil, and it started moving toward her.

His breathing turned rapid, wet dripping down his forehead. Lisa panicked. She tried to hold him, but the closer she got, the weaker Jack became. Terrified. She backed away and instantly Jack's breathing steadied. That's when the truth finally hit her. She was the problem. The next morning, Lisa secretly visited another doctor, hoping for answers. When the results came back, the doctor frowned. Your body emits an unusual hormone, pheromone, that over stimulates certain men. Too much contact will exhaust them, sometimes fatally. Lisa froze. Her mind went blank. The doctor continued, your husband loves you deeply, but if his body keeps weakening like this, he won't last long. Lisa staggered out of the clinic, tears blurring her vision. All she could think about was Jack's smile, Jack's warmth, Jack's promises. That night she sat beside Jack while he slept, gently brushing his hair and made a decision. The next morning, Jack woke up and found Lisa gone. Only a note remained on the pillow. Jack, to protect you, I have to stay away. Please live. Jack tore out of the house, searching for her everywhere, calling her name in the street.

To prolong their sadistic pleasure, the tribesmen drove bamboo tubes into him, roasting him slowly over the flames. A second poacher was tied to the ground, a venomous snake tossed in front of him. The snake hesitated at first, but spooked by the fire, it lunged straight for the man watching this. John feared he might be next. Soon, John was dragged to the hunting ground. The chief shot an arrow, then unexpectedly let it fly freely. The farther John ran, the more exhilarated the tribe became. But as soon as he passed where the arrow landed, a warrior sprang after him. Though John was strong, the heat was unbearable. Within 10 seconds, the warrior closed. Seeing John falter, the warrior hurled a spear, which missed, then drew a knife. But John reacted swiftly. He overpowered the attacker, grabbed his gear and kept running. More warriors joined the chase, but before long, one collapsed from a heart attack. John seized the opportunity to vanish into the woods. There, he crafted sandals from grass and spotted a giant snail, cracked its shell and ate it to regain strength. Just then, a third warrior crept up behind him. John noticed in time and bolted. Spotting a cactus along the path, he had an idea. He pierced it, letting the milky sap seep out.

But an accident during the procedure left her with no memory at all. She couldn't recall her own name or why she had the surgery in the first place. Yet when the facial dressings were removed, a flawless face was revealed. Even the surgeon marveled, calling it his masterpiece. Confronted with this beautiful yet unfamiliar face, Anna decided to start a new life. She was presented as a domestic worker in a sprawling mansion, unaware that this was the very place she had once most desperately tried to escape. Anna had once been the lady of the house, but upon secretly discovering her husband's secrets, she had chosen to flee. She never imagined that the owner of the mansion in the photos was herself. At that moment, Jack, the mansion's owner, appeared. Seeing his family, he thought his long lost wife had finally returned. But when she turned around, he realized he had made a mistake. Jack scrutinized Anna's face carefully, asking if she was the new housemaid. Just then, Jack's daughter spotted Anna and ran toward her with excitement, leaving mother and daughter both utterly shocked.

Out of nowhere, a horrifying foot appeared in front of her. The unexpected sight made her eyes widen in shock. Almost instantly, a woman who looked as if she had climbed straight out of a grave emerged before her. The girl shrank into the corner of the elevator, trembling, but the woman didn't press a single button. He simply followed her all the way to her floor. Only when the eerie figure walked far enough away did the girl dare step out of the elevator. At the moment she entered the hallway, she suddenly noticed the woman was knocking on her neighbor's door. Even though fear nearly paralyzed her, she forced herself to stay composed and hurried past, wanting nothing more than to get home. She rushed inside, finally letting out a shaky breath. But just as she reached for her phone to call the police, the knocking outside abruptly stopped. Driven by curiosity and darkness, she opened the door to see what was happening. The hallway was completely empty. Strange woman had vanished without a trace. The girl assumed the visitor had simply gone to another apartment, so she didn't think much of it. But what she never expected was that the next night after.

He walked away calmly and headed straight to the hotel room beside the pool. The moment he saw the messy sheets, he was certain his wife had truly betrayed him. That evening, when she returned home, he intentionally stepped forward and gave her a warm embrace. But that didn't mean he would tolerate her infidelity. He wasn't just planning to expose her mask. He meant more than that. Missus Smith, I'm sorry. Don't be. Gunshot startled the gardener outside. Urgent knocking followed immediately after. Yet he remained completely composed, firing several shots toward the window to scare everyone away. Then he dragged his wife's body aside, picked up the spent shell casings, and rearranged the entire crime scene. He removed the shirt that might have been stained with blood and tossed it into the fireplace. Finally, he scrubbed himself with hot water again and again, washing off any trace of gunpowder residue. Then he sat down quietly, waiting for the police to arrive.

The paper absorbed the liquid almost instantly. He lifted the note out and unfolded it with care. What had been a crisp, freshly printed Bill now looked naturally aged and weather worn. They repeated the same routine with bundle after bundle. Note dip hung along a string to dry, then blasted with a hair dryer until it looked convincingly used. They went through all this trouble for one reason, every single Bill was fake and worn out. Cash, unlike flawless bills, didn't attract suspicion. To see whether their creations could fool anyone, the pair headed into a tiny corner shop. Riley handed one of the notes to the shopkeeper to buy a small item. The moment the shopkeeper glanced at the Bill, his expression tightened. Something felt wrong. Riley froze, panic rising in his chest. Sensing danger, Jack acted fast. He grabbed Riley's arm and pulled him away. Before the shopkeeper could react, they disappeared into the crowd, escaping by pure luck. They had assumed counterfeiting money was simple, but their very first attempt had collapsed in seconds. Staring at the rejected bills, Jack began to reconsider everything they had been wrong from the very beginning. Real Indian currency used a unique cotton based substrate, a texture completely unlike regular paper. It also produced a sharp, distinct snap when handled. Then there was the color shifting ink changing shades at different angles and the embedded security strip woven into the Note, if they truly wanted believable imitation, they would have to overcome all of those challenges. Even the intricate designs surrounding the portraits would have to be recreated manually, because scanning real bills only made the microscopic text work and expose itself as fake, no matter how expensive the printer might be.

Instead, he rolled the sheets into tiny pellets, soak them in water, squeeze them dry, and press them together with toothpaste until they hardened into a solid plug. That plug was the heart of his escape plan. During meal, the guards unlocked his cuff only for a short window, and the moment one looked away, he slipped the paper plug into the lock. After the guard closed the door and walked off, he gave it a light push. The first door slid open. The second door used an electronic keypad, but he had already prepared for that. The guards never bothered taking the milk cart, so he crushed his flat on the ground, peeled off the transparent plastic sleeve. That sleeve became his second key. After the guard entered the code, the man's fingerprints stayed on the plastic, feeling a four digit sequence. But that still wasn't enough. Four digits could be arranged 24 different ways. He needed time to test them all. Unfortunately, he hit the correct one. But he didn't bolt. He first tapped into the security feed, then calmly returned to his cell. Because this was only phase one. To fully break out, he needed far more Intel. From day one, he stayed quiet, played fragile, made the guards assume he was harmless. Truth was, he was memorizing their footsteps, their rotations, and when they got lazy. After two weeks, he finally spotted a rhythm. Every time yard time ended, his guard called the guy in the control booth, and the two stepped out onto the roof for a quick smoke break. Five minutes up, five minutes back. Those five

Her parents, blind as they were, were out there searching, desperately calling her name into the storm. Anna's boyfriend grabbed her hand, worried we should go back, he said. But Anna shook her head, no, they'll just lecture me again. I can't go back yet. Hours passed. Anna eventually grew tired and cold, sitting under a flickering street lamp.

The faint vibration reminded her of the life she had left behind, the parents who loved her unconditionally despite their blindness and her rebellion. Heart racing, Anna realized how reckless she had been. She stood up, shaking and whispered into the rain, I'm coming home. Her parents hearing her voice faintly through the storm, felt a spark of hope. They called out again, louder this time, their hearts pounding.

She whispered a single word, almost too quiet to hear why. Lucy felt a shiver as the room seemed to tighten around her. The experiments, the serum, the countless nights spent meddling with life and death. It all felt suddenly fragile and perilously close to being exposed. Lisa, still holding her daughter, turned to Lucy. Thank you for saving her, she said earnestly, unaware of the darker truth behind her words. But the girl's eyes never left Lucy. It was as if in those brief moments of death and revival she had glimpsed something beyond life, something that made her understand more than anyone should.

And somewhere deep inside, Lucy realized that she had awakened something far more unpredictable than she could ever control.

But this is one of the biggest mooring mistakes you can make, because the moment that line tightens, it unleashes an enormous amount of force. And if you don't let go at the exact right moment, your hand can get caught instantly. And don't be fooled by how thick and tough those ropes look. They're trying to stop a ship weighing tens of thousands of tons. If that rope snaps, it recoils like a whip with enough power to launch 100 pound object into the air. In dummy tests, the line tore through metal railings and cut the mannequin clean in half. Now imagine that happening to a real person. To prevent tragedies like this, mooring lines must be replaced regularly, no matter how good they look on the outside. Here's how it works. During docking, crew members on the ship throw a thin line with a heavy knot attached. One end of this thin line is tied to the main mooring rope. Workers on shore pull the thin line in, dragging the heavy mooring line onto the dock. They secure it to the bollard while the rope is still loose, avoiding any sudden violent tension. That's how you keep a docking operation safe, smooth and disaster free.

So Anna quickly reminded him just when Jack said that the suspect had a beard, unexpectedly the announcer said that the suspect's beard was fake. And then they realized that the suspect without the beard looked very much like Jack in front of them. At that time, broadcast said that the killer was 6 4 feet tall. Jack explained that he was only 5 4 feet tall. However, it turned out to be a slip of the tongue by the announcer. The real height of the suspect was actually 5 4 feet. And from the surveillance footage, they Learned about the music that the suspect was playing at that time. But Jack was relieved because that song was the one he hated the most. Just when they thought they had wrongly blamed Jack, the phone rang and the ringtone was exactly the same as the song mentioned in the broadcast. Jack immediately explained that it must have been his mother who said it. Then the broadcast announced the specific time when the incident happened. And at that time, Jack had been playing with his girlfriend at Disneyland all day long. But then the broadcast suddenly said that the crime scene was in the underground garage of Disneyland.

And when one woman got suspicious about what seemed to be a smoke detector in her rental apartment bedroom. This is not a drill. Fake smoke detectors are popping up in bedrooms across America and they're not there to keep you safe. Such an adrenaline filled moment. 23 year old Dakota Williams was laying in bed in her basement apartment when she says something suspicious caught her eye. I noticed that there were actually two smoke detectors in the room. It wasn't a smoke detector at all. Inside was a hidden camera. It seems like any ordinary smoke detector, but take a closer look. This tiny lens can secretly record your every move and even transmit video live. So whoever's watching can spy on you in real time. Inside this Colorado Springs rental home, this sounds like a horror movie. You find this hidden camera and you think he's actually looking at you. Were you terrified? I definitely was. But who put it there? Her first thought, maybe it was the landlord's boyfriend.

He stared at the burger in his hands, not sure if he should take a bite. Was it really fresh? He looked around and saw everyone else eating happily. So he opened the bag, checked the food, and finally took a cautious bite. Just then, a janitor walked by and started chatting with him. What do you think of the burger? The man asked. This might be the best hamburger I've ever had in my life. Oh, we aim to please. Um, Mac McDonald. Only then did Croc realize that this ordinary looking janitor was actually the owner of the restaurant. Excited, he quickly handed over his business card and asked if he could learn more about the place. As a traveling salesman, Croc spent most of his time on the road. He usually ate whatever he could find along the way. But in 1950s America, even the fastest rivens took at least 30 minutes to serve a meal. Now, at 52, his career was going nowhere.

Why? To test if the paralyzed man could really feel nothing. During meal time, he kept getting distracted by the pretty secretary and ended up spoon feeding rice right into his boss's eye. In caregiver training, he was either snoring or zoning out. And when lifting the boss into a wheelchair, he almost dropped opted him. Later that night, the boss tried to answer a phone call. Without thinking, the caregiver handed him the phone, completely forgetting the man was paralyzed from head to toe. He was careless, blunt, and had no filter. Thought the boss's beard looked ugly and gave him one wild makeover after another. Like this. And this. And this. You think the boss would have fired him on the spot, but instead, he offered him an incredibly high salary. Because somehow these two, so different in background, in personality, in everything, ended up becoming the best of friends for life. The boss's name was Philippe. He used to be a billionaire, but a paragliding accident left him completely paralyzed. His wife passed away soon after. Felipe decided to hire a caregiver. The pay was generous, and the candidates lined up in suits and ties. Some came from elite universities, some had walls full of awards. Everyone was desperate to prove themselves. Except for one. He walked in wearing street clothes. And he wasn't here to get the job. He Was here to get rejected because once a person is turned down by three employers, they're eligible for government unemployment benefits. So Dris, the man in question, had no intention of being polite. He insulted Felipe's taste, mocked his lack of humor. He treated Felipe like he was nobody. And oddly enough, Felipe found it hilarious. While the others were too stiff and careful, Dris was blunt, direct, and real. So Felipe played a little trick. He told Dris to come back the next day for a signature on the rejection form. What Felipe didn't know was that Dris

That incident made me understand something about life. Working hard doesn't always lead to good results. Taking shortcuts is the safest way. Ten years passed quickly and I kept working toward my dream. I hung around all kinds of high end clubs every day. And on my 20th birthday, I finally found the target I've been looking for, for my buddy. I Learned the rich lady was 55 this year. She had just divorced and had no kids. And most importantly, she owned the biggest supermarket chain in the entire country. Her assets were too many to count. I got excited the moment I heard it. Old but loaded and her health wasn't great. She was literally the woman of my dreams. Without hesitation, I jumped straight into the pool, then swam over to her to show off my strong body. Oh, I think I'm making you wet. And just like that, I married into a wealthy family. 25 years passed in the blink of an eye. Today was our wedding anniversary. She. Gave me another 1 million dollar watch. It wasn't expensive, but I still had to pretend to be happy. Then she looked at me with anticipation. That's when I realized I completely forgot about the anniversary, let alone preparing a gift for her. Luckily, I reacted fast and I lied that I had a surprise for her, but she had to go pick it up herself. Hearing that made her very happy. Happy anniversary, darling. What a sweet thought. Get in. Get in. I would, but with my niece, I'm afraid it's too close to the ground for me. Alright, forget it. We won't get it then. Oh, I don't want my niece to ruin our special day. No, it's okay. It's okay. It could be your car, too, I suppose. It could work. And what form of payment will you be using today, sir? Um, her. Very good. I'll see you then.

The latest hospital reports reveal that thousands of children across the United States are being rushed to ER's with stomach pain and severe vomiting. The surprising link in these cases Doritos, known for their sharp seasoning, acidic spice blend, artificial colors, and intense flavoring. These bright orange chips may look harmless, but experts warn that developing digestive systems struggle with highly seasoned, ultra processed foods. Digestive irritation, burning in the throat, reflux, and even lingering sensitivity can appear suddenly, and parents say the symptoms often continue into the next day. Some doctors warn that repeated exposure to strong artificial flavors may create long term irritation that goes unnoticed at first. Even more concerning, this snack offers almost no nutritional value, yet its strong addictive taste encourages frequent snacking. Over time, heavy seasoning and acids may quietly affect digestion.

Every time the boss walked across the glass floor upstairs, it creaked loudly under his feet, and even the metal framework beneath seemed to bend and strain. All these signs clearly suggested that his boss's weight was far beyond normal. What was even stranger was that whenever the boss went upstairs to his office, two employees had to support him as he climbed. But the moment he stepped onto level ground, he could move with surprising agility. The boss also had an unusually sharp sense of smell. So sharp that he could tell from hundreds of feet away exactly which employee had eaten garlic. He'd immediately order that person to go wash thoroughly from head to toe. All of these bizarre, almost inhuman behaviours didn't escape the attention of Jack. When Jack noticed that the second floor floorboards were made entirely of glass, a bold idea crossed his mind. If the glass under the boss's feet were to shatter, the boss would fall through, and Jack could finally confirm whether his boss was truly human or not. To test how much weight it would take to break the glass, Jack quickly built a small computer program. But while he was running his experiments, his boss suddenly appeared behind him. Thinking fast, Jack explained that he was just developing a gravity game. Surprisingly, the boss seemed intrigued and even told Jack To finish the game overnight. The next day, after testing the game, the boss decided it would become the company's next big project. Just like that, Jack, who was supposed to be laid off, suddenly found himself favored by the boss.

Sin darse cuenta, pronto los guardias se dieron cuenta. Sam no aparecía por ninguna parte a la hora de comer. No fue hasta que entró en la celda que se dio cuenta. No era Sam quien estaba en la celda. El guardia se quedó helado. Algo iba muy mal. Alcaide fue llamado a toda prisa para comprobar. Después de mover las camas, apareció un enorme agujero en el suelo. El Alcaide se dio cuenta de que Sam había desaparecido, pero era demasiado tarde porque Sam ya había nadado hasta la superficie y escapó de la prisión que lo había retenido durante 14 años. Lo que le esperaba ahora también era venganza. Pero antes de la venganza faltaba algo crucial. Era quitarse el llamativo uniforme de la prisión porque las calles estaban llenas de soldados. Así que se coló en una granja y se puso algo adecuado. Al día siguiente, Sam volvió a casa con la intención de ir a casa a visitar a su padre primero. Sin embargo, para su sorpresa, su padre murió en el primer año de su encarcelamiento. La causa de la muerte fue debido a la enfermedad de la nostalgia. Lo que le sorprendió aún más fue había otra tumba junto a la lápida de su padre. Su nombre estaba escrito en ella. No fue hasta entonces que Sam se dio cuenta. Su enemigo quería que se pudriera en La cárcel. Lo siguiente que Sam comprendió fue que estaba desesperado. Cuando llegó a la casa de su esposa con anticipación, se enteró de que ella se había vuelto a casar y había viajado a París con su enemigo. Esto era demasiado para Sam. Cuando caminaba por la calle, se perdió. De repente se encontró con un grupo de soldados. Estaba tan asustado que se escondió apresuradamente porque ahora es un fugitivo. Si le encontraban, le llevarían de vuelta. Un prisionero se acercó corriendo. Al ver a un soldado golpeando al prisionero, Sam intervino directamente para ayudar. Luego abrió las cadenas del prisionero. Sam le dijo al prisionero que huyera, pero él se negó a irse y siguió a Sam. Después de ver venir de nuevo a un grupo de soldados, tuvieron que esconderse dentro del vagón. Así escaparon. Hasta entonces, Sam no sabía que era un contrabandista. Ahora su barco está en el puerto, pero es una pena que no pueda navegarlo. Sam tuvo una buena idea en cuanto oyó eso, porque él solía ser capitán. Entonces Sam le siguió para escapar al barco. Viendo como el cielo de repente se oscurecía con nubes. Sam dijo que pronto habría tormenta. Por seguridad, fueron a Montecristo. De hecho, Sam vino aquí a propósito para encontrar el tesoro del conde de Montecristo. Entonces Sam fingió ir a la montaña a buscar comida, pero en realidad sacó el mapa del tesoro. Sigue la guía para encontrar el tesoro. Sin embargo, se sentía Extraño. No importaba cómo siguiera el mapa, siempre llegaba a un acantilado. Al caer la noche, la duda de Sam se hizo más profunda. Aquellas dos rocas le parecieron extrañas, así que volvió a Monte Cristo de nuevo. Cuando hizo una cuidadosa búsqueda en los alrededores, encontró lo que parecía ser una cueva abajo. Después de mover las rocas, un agujero oscuro apareció frente a él. Esto hizo que Sam se sintiera estaciado. Al instante se precipitó de cabeza en el agujero. Cuando entró, se quedó helado. La cueva estaba repleta de cofres de oro y joyas.

Por su expresión de dolor, se podía deducir qué en solo 2 minutos los delincuentes la habían metido en el maletero. Cuando se quitaron las máscaras y mostraron sus rostros, la verdad finalmente salió a la luz. Resultó que hoy era el cumpleaños de la chica. Sus amigas querían darle una sorpresa, pero esa sorpresa pronto se convertiría en un susto. Cuando el coche llegó a un aparcamiento, ellas sacaron sus cámaras para grabar la expresión de la chica atada cuando las viera. Sin embargo, en el momento en que se abrió el maletero, todas se quedaron paralizadas en el sitio e incluso las cámaras que tenían en las manos se rompieron. La chica, debido al nerviosismo, se tragó la pelota de béisbol que se le atascó en la garganta, provocándole dificultades respiratorias y causándole la muerte. Ante este desenlace, se miraron unos a otros sin saber cómo resolver la situación. Pero el error ya estaba cometido y había que solucionarlo. Al fin y al cabo, ellos y la chica estudiaban en la misma universidad. Si no asistían a clase durante mucho tiempo, los profesores se pondrían en contacto con los padres de la chica. En ese momento sería imposible ocultarlo. Tras discutirlo, lisa llamó al profesor. Haciéndose pasar por la madre de la chica y pidió que le dieran una baja prolongada. Su fortaleza mental era realmente impresionante, ya que pudieron volver a clase con total naturalidad. Lisa incluso prometió a sus compañeros, si hacéis lo que os digo y seguís mis instrucciones, os garantizo que todo saldrá bien. Después de clase, llevaron el cadáver a su dormitorio y simularon un robo en la escena del crimen. Sin embargo, mientras estaban ocupadas con el cadáver, la compañera de mesa de la chica han vino a llevarle unos documentos. Por desgracia han presenció la escena. La chica se asustó y salió corriendo. Las hermanas se levantaron inmediatamente para perseguirla. Después de todo, si este asunto se divulgaba, ellas también se verían implicadas. Pronto alcanzaron a annie, la inmovilizaron en una silla. Lisa le prometió solemnemente que si anne les ayudaba a guardar el secreto, partir de ese momento serían todas buenas amigas. Finalmente, tras sus persuasiones, lograron lavarle el cerebro a anne. Desde ese día, anne se transformó y logró entrar en el círculo de la alta sociedad. Pensó que su vida elegante continuaría, pero todo cambió ese día. Los padres de la chica terminaron su viaje antes de tiempo y al presenciar la escena del crimen decidieron llamar a la policía. El asunto pronto se convirtió en un escándalo en la escuela, quizás incapaz de soportar la culpa. Poco después ana decidió abandonar el grupo de 4, pero lisa no le dio importancia al fin y Al cabo, todos habían participado en el asesinato. No creía que ana se atreviera a contarlo. Por otro lado, con la investigación policial, pronto se centraron en ellos, pero todos habían ensayado sus declaraciones, así que no revelaron nada. Solo. Ana estuvo a punto de confesar varias veces, pero por miedo a ir a la cárcel, finalmente guardó silencio. Así el caso volvió a quedar en punto muerto. Sin embargo, pronto los policías obtuvieron una pista importante. El día del suceso, la compañera de mesa de la chica, annie, le había llevado unos documentos.

Just as they were about to pull the same trick again, the dragon messed up and fell into a shallow area of water. The villagers rushed over with weapons raised. The dragon couldn't fake its death any longer and had to fly off into the sky. That's when the Villagers finally realized the truth. They figured out Jack was just a con man. Sensing the danger, Jack tried to escape on horseback. But the villagers had already surrounded him. Just when things seemed their worst, the dragon suddenly returned and carried Jack up into the sky.

This immediately sparked the boy's curiosity. But just as he reached out to touch it, an old man stopped him, angrily scolding Sam. Fortunately, the sheriff's daughter arrived just in time. After apologizing to the old man, she quickly pulled Sam away. Strangely, after they left, the old man continued stroking the pumpkin as if comforting a child. Once they were gone, Sam couldn't stop thinking about the pumpkin. He became determined to uncover the truth behind the face. Soon enough, his chance arrived. He went to the Halloween event. By chance, the old man left his coat with the house keys inside. After the old man walked away, Sam quietly took the keys. He made his way to the storage shed. He grabbed the pumpkin and pulled, but the vine was unusually tough. Noticing an axe nearby, Sam picked it up and began chopping at the pumpkin. After 81 strikes, the vine finally snapped. He carried the pumpkin back to his mother, lying that the old man had given it to them. His mother didn't suspect anything. But as they were leaving, the scarecrow nearby suddenly twitched. Sam carried the pumpkin home, but before he could uncover its secret, the pumpkin had already rotted. The old man returned to the shed and noticed the pumpkin was missing. He immediately contacted the sheriff for help. That evening during dinner, the sheriff told Sam's mother about the stolen pumpkin. After hearing the story, his Brother Finn spoke with Sam, but Sam refused to return the pumpkin himself. So Finn reluctantly took it back to the shed. When he opened his backpack, he found a human head inside.

Jason saltó inmediatamente a rescatarla, pero cuando la sacó, descubrió que solo era una muñeca. No pudo evitar reír y llorar al mismo tiempo. Él y su compañero continuaron su camino al trabajo en el centro comercial. En el trayecto, tocó casualmente la muñeca. Durante esto, recogió un collar. La muñeca se transformó al instante en una persona real. Tan pronto como la soltó, volvió a ser una muñeca. Al llegar a su taller, contempló la bella apariencia de la muñeca y deseó en silencio que fuera real. Tras mirar alrededor para asegurarse de que nadie estaba cerca, no pudo resistir inclinarse para besarla. Luego comenzó su trabajo de organizar la mercancía y quitó casualmente el collar de la muñeca. Jessie, que había dormido durante 1 000 años, despertó. Ella estornudó. Jason, asustado, cayó hacia atrás al suelo. Sin embargo, Jessie se alegró de ver a Jason, pues guardaba un parecido asombroso con su prometido, el príncipe de hace 1 000 años. Justo entonces, varios trabajadores del camión llegaron. Jessi se quedó inmóvil al instante, fingiendo ser una muñeca. Tras confirmar que la muñeca estaba intacta, se dieron la vuelta y se fueron. El estómago de Jessi de repente gruñó. Jason la llevó a comer algo. Ella contempló el mundo 1 000 años después. Fascinada por todo, incluso se comió el envoltorio de la comida. Jason le enseñó a comer comida moderna y la llevó a una sala de baile para Enseñarle a bailar finalmente la llevó de vuelta a su casa y pasaron una noche maravillosa juntos. Temprano, a la mañana siguiente, Jason bajó a preparar el desayuno. Jessie vio un espejo. Intrigada, tomó una joya para ponérsela. No notó que había tomado el collar equivocado. Por error, la madre de Jason observó a su hijo preparando el desayuno. Instantáneamente adivinó que estaba enamorado. ¿Te acostaste con esta amiga? No yo. Él, tímidamente, llevó el desayuno arriba, solo para descubrir que Jessi se había transformado de nuevo en muñeca. Arrojó a Jessi a la cama. Su madre escuchó el alboroto y subió, presenciando la escena y asumiendo que su hijo había desarrollado algún hobby peculiar. Pero Jason se sumió en la duda. ¿Podría todo lo que vivió anoche realmente haber sido solo un sueño?

Nunca tengo que preocuparme por cómo deshacerme de los cadáveres. Esto hace que mis crímenes casi no dejen rastro. Esta bolsa no se ve diferente a una bolsa de plástico normal. Es muy fácil de llevar. Una vez que se coloca un cuerpo dentro y se presiona el botón, en menos de una hora, el líquido corrosivo de la bolsa convertirá el cuerpo en agua sanguinolenta. Ahora me disfrazo de él. Ya había preparado de antemano un molde facial suyo. Mi apariencia puede pasar casi por la suya. Esta vez, los objetivos son la pareja a punto de casarse, la persona de la que me acabo de ocupar. Solo era para conseguir una entrada al lugar. Una vez que me deshaga de esta persona, solo necesito quitarme el disfraz completo y luego podré desaparecer de la escena sin dejar rastro. Mientras observaba los alrededores. De repente, noté a un invitado con una cámara diminuta en el pecho. Sospecho que esta persona es un policía encubierto enviado por la policía. Si actúo ahora, definitivamente me atraparán inmediatamente. Llamé a mi jefe cuando asignaron el trabajo. No debería haber intervención policial, así que me arriesgué a pedirle un pago más alto. En ese momento, una camarera irrumpió. Al principio no me vio. Cuando se percató de mí, se aterrorizó. Todavía sostenía la ostra que acababa de sacar. Por un momento, no estaba seguro de si había escuchado la conversación sobre este asesinato, pero entonces se me ocurrió una Idea brillante. Decidí usarla como chivo expiatorio. La víctima perfecta en la media concha. Tomé suavemente el cuchillo para ostras de su mano. Luego desenchufé el refrigerador. Todo estaba listo. Era hora de empezar a trabajar. Finalmente, encontré una oportunidad para estar a solas con él. Al principio solo sentía curiosidad por mi comportamiento. Cuando bajó completamente la guardia, lo inmovilicé con mis manos. Saqué casualmente un sedante. Desafortunadamente no había tiempo suficiente. Ahora lo principal era apurarse y mover el cuerpo. Cuando comenzó a anochecer, hice que pareciera borracho y lo sostuve con dificultad. Como había cortado la energía de la nevera de antemano, las ostras dentro ya habían comenzado a oler mal. Ella estaría ansiosa por conseguir ostras de repuesto. Esta vez, casualmente estaba recogiendo ostras frescas, lo que cayó justo en mi trampa. Fue entonces cuando encontró su cuchillo clavado en la víctima. La clave final era hacer que ella cargara con la culpa de mi crimen. Unos minutos después, los fuegos artificiales en la playa se encendieron. La atención de todos se dirigió hacia allá. La novia todavía no se había percatado de la ausencia de su marido. Los fuegos artificiales comenzaron antes de lo esperado. Ella corrió angustiada hacia la orilla. Estaba a punto de preguntar por qué faltaba su esposo, pero cuando lo vio, el efecto de la droga acababa de pasar. Todos fueron testigos de la escena. Ella sostenía el arma homicida en su mano. No importa cómo suplicara, yo ya la había Incriminado como la asesina perfecta, yo no lo hice

They had a ton of juice probably an hour and a half ago. Does this seem to be a safe environment for your children? It is completely safe. This is a safe environment, huh? They trash the place. I'm not enthused so far. Both of y'all are gonna be going to jail tonight. We don't tolerate this. The conditions they're in is unsafe for them. We have no money.

Let's go to the hallway. And I said, first of all, that's the funniest fucking thing I've ever heard. But then I had to tell him something really devastating. I didn't want to tell him this.

Haha, I. I think she's serious, you guys. Then we gotta get out of here. My eyebrows just grew back from her last gift. Harper, sit down. My gift is not something that technically can be wrapped. Oh, my gosh, it is fire! Stop, stop, and roll! Stop, stop, and roll! You guys, hear me out. Four years ago, I used magic to create a duplicate of you, and I sent him out to college. What? Yeah, and he's about to graduate. What? So basically, I just saved you from, like, four more years of school. What? I have to agree with Justin on this one. What? Harper, will you please tell Justin that he's overreacting and that this is actually a good thing? It is a good thing. I can use the new Justin to make Zeke and the old Justin jealous, and then they can fight over me. I don't think it's gonna work. I think the old Justin heard me. Is he here yet? Harper, what are you wearing? This Is a college man we're talking about, Alex. I did choose something for my mature collection. Well, does that dress come with a horse and buggy? Oh, my gosh. Look, here I come. Oh, man. I'm not wearing an ascot. What happened to you? College. It changed me. What are you talking about? Shh. Alex, I need to speak to you real quick. One minute. Hey, where are you guys going? Secrets are for people who have something to hide. Look at what you're doing. This guy is a total mess. I am a total mess. Don't worry. We'll recombine the two of you. That'll get rid of him, but you'll get to keep all of his knowledge and memories. Just get him in the volley. I know I was rethinking you, but now I'm gonna go back to what I originally thought. You're a dirty creep. And your honesty is like a ray of sunshine. Currently. Justin's back to work. It's nice to have you back, Justin. Yeah. What's so great about it? Excuse me? Oh, no. What did you do to him? I made a duplicate of Justin, and I put him through four years of college, and then I recombine the two of them, and it ended up drastically changing Justin's personality to a point where he's really not even recognizable anymore. And why aren't you laughing at me? Alex, this is horrible. You're going to ruin your brother's graduation. Gonna fix this, young lady so he Can have his graduation. So you're telling me that I have to come up with a solution all by myself to a problem that I created all by myself? Well, that's not fair.

Tout d'abord, dans certaines gares au japon, une barrière s'abaisse à côté du train avant son départ, empêchant ainsi les gens de tomber accidentellement sur les voies ou même d'y aller volontairement. Ensuite, lorsqu'un client achète une voiture chez un concessionnaire, les employés arrêtent la circulation pour que l'acheteur puisse partir en toute sécurité, un client devant lui lorsqu'il s'en va, ainsi que devant les voitures qui se sont arrêtées pour le laisser passer. Dans presque tous les espaces publics au japon, il y a des en jaune en relief sur le sol que les personnes malvoyantes peuvent suivre pour se déplacer en toute sécurité et éviter les obstacles. Ensuite, dans les apple store japonais, il n'y a pas de dispositif de sécurité. Sur les iphone, vous pouvez entrer, prendre un téléphone et le manipuler librement. Même les macbooks sont simplement connectés au chargeur, et donc les débrancher et les soulever sans problème. Aussi, de nombreux magasins au japon n'ont pas d'employés, parce qu'ils font confiance en l'honnêteté des gens. Quand vous arrivez à la caisse, la machine sait déjà quel produit vous avez pris, et les scans automatiques. Et enfin, si vous perdez votre téléphone ou votre portefeuille au japon, vous avez de grandes chances de le récupérer en quelques heures. De plus, lorsque quelqu'un vous rend un objet perdu, ce geste est toujours célébré avec gratitude et courtoisie.

No, because there'll never be 1.3 million. Are you out of your tiny little mind, Mrs. Forrick? You don't need to say little when you say tiny. One or the other will do. You're silly me. You're suing a sitting judge. Do you understand the meaning of professional suicide? I know the meaning of a judge who let an innocent man sit in prison for 8 months. Did you miss the day in law school where they taught the concept of judicial immunity that protects you from being sued for what you did professionally, not personally? This crusade is gonna cost you. It's gonna cost you so much. Should we get that down on tape, your honor? Your ex parte threats? I didn't think so. See you in court. But we are filing a civil rights claim under 42 USC 1983. Going after the judge personally is merely an end around. No. We are holding Don Shikowski accountable as an individual for violating Mr Riggs Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial and Eighth Amendment, freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. He exceeded his authority. So he has to answer to this personally. My honor, this is a direct attack on the foundation of an independent judiciary. Imagine that your decision here in this case could be subject to a suit. It would be chaos. Exactly. Mrs. Florik may like or dislike the way his honor Shakowsky does his job, but she does not have the right to veto. We're not asking for a veto, your honor. This man has been held in prison for eight months. His bail set at $150,000. $150,000. What did he do? The charges, disorderly conduct. $150,000 for disorderly conduct? Yes, your honor. Three men knocked him down coming out of a concert and stole his wallet. When the police arrived, they arrested him, too. He was the victim, not the perpetrator. That isn't proven yet. Yes, because Shekawi, his honor, Shekawi, his honor, Shekawi has delayed trial three times. Three times, your honor. And 8 months later, our client is still in prison. He lost his job. His wife divorced him and his 8 year old child has been taken from his home. That is unjust. We ask that you rule on my client's immunity. Your honor, there is no suit here. If my client is found immune, I would agree. Thank you, your honor. No, I would agree that from all appearances, Mr Riggs has had his civil rights violated. But the question is whether his Honor Shikowski did so knowingly. If he did, his immunity is stripped after you plead not guilty. Clayton, what happened then? The judge slapped me with a six figure bail. And after arraignment, did you appear before Judge Schakowski again? Yeah, every couple months. They'd stick me in the van, bring me over, I'll be all ready for the trial. And then the prosecutor asked for more time and the judge gave it. He never even blink. Even though the prosecutor was delaying to find the same witness. Yes. Isn't it true, Mr Riggs, that this wasn't your first criminal offense? Objection. Mr Riggs, past is irrelevant to Shekowsi's immunity. Close to the issue of why Judge Shekowsi set bail so high overall. In fact, didn't the judge in that weapons case have to issue a bench warrant because you missed a court appearance? That was a few years ago. I was young and dumb. I turned myself in and I didn't screw up again. Didn't you agree to each of the 3 continuances in your case? No, I never agreed. Really? Because I have transcripts of all three hearings and every one of them clearly notes continuance by agreement.

She could be a spy. For that matter, the whole family could be spies. Well, we'll know soon enough. When I was in the house, I planted audio bugs. We'll be able to hear everything. Nice. We still have to distribute the rest of those weapons or else the mask will freak out. Who's the mask? Who is it? Casey, what do you want? We're busy. Y'all don't look busy. Hey, what is it, Casey? Um, really hard to say. Just spit it out. No, get out. Yeah, just really need a lot of support right now. Okay, Casey, just tell us what's wrong it. It's Amy's breath. Yeah, it's become unbearable. I would suggest that you review proper oral hygiene with her. Remember, flossing is not an option. It's a necessity. Good news. You got the laptop password and finally got the weapons distribution list. No, my new allergy medication really works. I was stuck under that couch with that cat and never actually sneeze. Amy probably isn't involved with any of this. Her parents waited till She was upstairs to talk about us, so she probably has no idea about the spying. Amy may be clueless, but her parents suspected we're spies. They bugged our house and they keep mentioning someone named the mask is calling all the shots. Now that we know that our house is bugged, we can use those bugs to throw them off our track. Good thinking, Casey. Oh, thank goodness you made it out okay. I'm starting to get worried. Uh, yeah, I'm gonna go make a smoothie. That blender is so loud. I'm gonna put on some nice music so we don't have to listen to that. This is one delicious movie. Oh, hey, mom and dad, how's everything going at the accounting firm? Don't spare me any details. I wanna know everything. As you know, Casey, in accounting, the debt to equity ratio is the relationship of total debt of a company to its ordinary share capital. Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. Beg to differ.

This incident utterly ruined her life. As she wrung out her soaked clothes, a rich kid from the next room caught glimpses of her body through the fabric. Unaware that the mirror before her was two way, she frantically tried to wring out her clothes. Seated in the adjacent room, young air reveled in this tantalizing spectacle. Minutes later, his intentions turned sinister. Seizing an opportunity when the house was empty, he barged into her room, brandishing a wine bottle and demanding she join him for drinks. Seeing the drunken rich kid, the girl immediately panicked. But he gave her no chance to refuse, pushing her down forcefully. Terrified, she struggled desperately to escape, finally grabbing a bottle and smashing it hard against the man. Just as she tried to flee the spectacle, man burst in. She begged him for help. Shockingly, the two were in cahoots. Now she seemed trapped. Spotting the rich kid approaching, the girl kicked the man away in terror and fled the room, sprinting up the stairs to the rooftop. Just then, her parents returned home. They lived there as caretakers for the wealthy family. Today, couple had been summoned out of town by the conglomerate chairman, leaving their daughter alone. Upon arriving, the mother felt unwell and retired to rest. Dot dot dot! Father knew the chairman's son had returned from abroad today and assumed his daughter was busy in the mansion. He Rushed over immediately to find her, but his calls went unanswered. Upon reaching the second floor, he heard his daughter screams and realized something was terribly wrong. He raced toward the rooftop, only to encounter the wealthy heir's friend, the bespectacled man, in the stairwell. The bespectacled man attempted to block the elderly man from ascending, clutching him tightly to restrain him. However, exerting excessive force, he accidentally pushed Satan's father down the stairs. When he rushed forward to check, he discovered the elderly man had no pulse. In that moment, the man realized he had accidentally killed someone. Dot meanwhile, the rich kid cornered Sitong in a rooftop room. The girl frantically dashed to the balcony, grabbing a nearby heavy object to barricade the glass door. But the rich kid soon forced his way in, terrifying sitong into fleeing outside the balcony to keep him at bay. Startled by her actions, the man reached out to pull her back, but siding knew she couldn't escape being violated tonight. After a moment of inner turmoil, she let go and jumped out. What? The two drunken playboys had murdered an innocent father and daughter! Terrified, the rich kid frantically tried to flee, only to discover another body on the second floor. This horrifying sight plunged him back into panic. Collapsing beside the girl's body, he was overcome with regret. His former friend began blaming each other. The police uncovered this, their lives would be ruined. The bespectacled man quickly regained his Composure and urged his friend helming. Their priority now was disposing of the bodies. Hammig followed his advice, loading the father and daughter into an SUV to stage a traffic accident and evade legal consequences. Unexpectedly, their actions were witnessed by the company secretary. Haming confessed the truth and begged her to keep it secret to make the accident seem real. How may took an expensive necklace from his sister to help her brother avoid punishment. She had no choice but to cooperate. Thus, the man placed the necklace around Satan's neck. His plan was to frame her for stealing his sister's jewelry, then claim he fled to the balcony out of fear of arrest before accidentally falling. His father, rushing his daughter to the hospital, would then have been involved in a car accident. This chain of events should fool the police. Watching the car plunge off the cliff before their eyes, the two wealthy young men felt both exhilarated and terrified. Meanwhile, Setong's boyfriend, unable to reach her, frantically dialed her number. The ringing phone triggered a reaction in the woman.

He then turned the winch to tighten the wire and finally adjusted the rooftop spotlight position so it could shine directly on vehicles on the road. Soon night came and his target came speeding on his motorcycle. When the target was about to reach the trap, the assassin quickly turned on the spotlight. The sudden bright light left the man no time to react and he was instantly decapitated by the wire. The reason the assassin did this was to rob a locator device worth tens of millions on the victim. The locator contained the location of tons of drugs. To pass security checks smoothly during transport, conning drug dealer actually hid this shipment in a septic truck. Following the instructions on the locator, the assassin quickly found the location of the septic truck. But what he didn't expect was that besides their group, other people were also targeting this shipment. Just after entering the United States, police car followed them. The police inside demanded they stop for inspection. Since they had just passed police inspection at the border station, the assassin determined that these two were definitely fake police. So his companion quickly pulled out gun and got out of the car, hiding in the blind spot of the two fake police. Then the assassin hit the gas and drove away from there. Fake Police who couldn't react in time. One was shot dead on the spot while the other pulled out an Uzi and engaged in a gunfight with the two assassin. Due to the weapon gap, both were soon killed by this fake policeman. Just like that fake policeman, Jimmy successfully seized this shipment. The intense gunfight had shot a hole in the septic truck, so Jimmy had to cut a tree branch to temporarily block the small hole. But to safely deliver the goods to his boss, he still had to repair the truck properly. Fortunately, there was a repair shop nearby that specialized in gray business. The employees there were very professional. Seeing blood stains on the car, they never asked questions but skillfully cleaned it off. And their repair skills were also first rate. They first filled the bullet holes with molten iron blocks, then sprayed sulfuric acid oxidation to make it the same color as the surrounding. At this time, another group of people wanting to rob the goods appeared. This time they directly blocked Jimmy's boss.

Then he grabbed a nail gun and firmly secured the gun to the ground. As soon as the target appeared, Jimmy loaded an armor piercing bullet into the sniper rifle. He checked the wind direction with his palm, then adjusted the shooting angle. The official just stepped out of the plane. Jimmy pressed the fire button. Seconds later, the official and his bodyguard were hit simultaneously. Even the plane had a four inch hole. After a brief moment of excitement, Jimmy loaded another bullet. The official's wife was also on his hit. However, the bodyguard spotted his location using a reflection. He quickly moved toward Jimmy. Jimmy re adjusted his shooting angle. To his surprise, this guy was incredibly agile. He dodged all the consecutive shots. Time was up. Jimmy got ready to retreat. But as he was packing his weapon, police officer aimed a gun at him. Jimmy stayed calm. He falsely claimed he was also a police officer. While the cop was still suspicious, Jimmy quickly drew his own gun and took him down. By the time the bodyguards reached the rooftop, assassin was gone. The official's wife was still alive. So Jimmy had to strike again. This time, he had his rookie apprentice handle the assassination. Jack became extremely nervous the moment he picked up the sniper rifle. Meanwhile, the official's wife had even more private bodyguard. Just as Jack prepared to pull the trigger, bodyguard Noticed something from the reflection. They quickly shielded the woman. Jack's shot hit the police officer behind them instead. The bodyguard grabbed his gun and immediately gave chase. Jack's position was exposed. He abandoned the kill and ran at. At the same time, another shot rang out. The woman was hit and fell. The person who fired this time was actually Jimmy. It turned out he just wanted Jack to distract the bodyguard. He could then frame Jack for the crime. The bodyguard caught up to Jack at that moment.

Glancing at his wife, he saw she was still very overweight, so he began drawing from her abdomen. Soon her entire body was reduced to limp, sagging skin. The woman awoke in terror, witnessing him steal her flesh, and tried to rise in anger, but collapsed onto the couch from weakness. He mocked her expression, using the hose to fill his thin arm, and gradually worked across his body until it looked exactly as he wanted. She stared at him, scheming in a planned form, smiling at his spindly legs, she taunted, driving him into a blind fury. Without hesitation, she shoved the hose into his leg, pumping in fat and cranking the machine to maximum. He couldn't handle the pressure, the machine malfunctioned and his body swelled alarmingly. Furious, he tried to chase her, but his own weight caused him to tumble, flailing helplessly. Seizing the leftover fat, she turned on the machine.

And he had been in a gospel quartet in high school. And this little kid, his mom and daddy raised cattle. So this child knew all about cattle. Barry College put this child in charge of hundreds of heads of cattle. You boys that are my age, do y'all remember that poster everybody had in their, their bedroom? All the boys had it in their dorm room. And it was that poster, a fair faucet in that red bathing suit. Yes, with her nipple. Beautiful. I go to visit my boy in his room. I've done every diet in the world. My mama and my sister and I took dexatrim when I was 17 years old. I'm the youngest. You could buy it everywhere. Do you remember dexatrim? Yeah, it was speed. We took speed as a family. We would take the Dexter trim and our heads would itch. I can't even think about going on one of these trips until I get through Christmas. And I don't mean to sound like everything falls on me, but everything falls on me. I love my family, but they don't do anything to help me. I do all the decorating, the cooking, the cleaning, the wrapping, the shopping, the do all that. Last year on December the 24th, my husband said to me, can I help you do anything? And I said, I'm gonna beat you. To death. And I can't think about this trip cause I gotta get ready for Christmas and I get so torn up that I wanna take to the bed. I wanna take to the bed, for example, questions about the solar system. And finally one day I said, baby, I didn't pay attention in school. Is there anything you'd like to know about young and the rest of us? This is my take on snow skin. I had to get all those little children dressed with all those layers and then I had to put ski boots on. Little children, they go, no, mommy, no, don't put those ski boots on me. We were skiing. This baby child, she starts taking all of her clothes off. I go, what are you doing? And she said, my butthole itches. I remember praying to the Lord and saying, what did I do that was so bad that this is my vacation? Now, I don't know what it is about my husband in a hotel room, but he gets in a hotel room, gets a glazed look over his eyes and I feel like I'm doing this. And I knew what that meant. I'm gonna have to do unspeakable things. My middle child is my oldest daughter, and you may have seen a video about me talking about how hateful she was when she was a teenager. Thank you. Well, I'm not taking that back. We were scared to death of her. If You've got a teenage girl and you're going through that let me give you this hope they're gonna come out of that now it's gonna take a long time, but they're gonna come out of that and then they come back around and end up your very best friend I know girls yummy okay, she takes care of me just like I'm her baby now she calls and checks on me calls me three or four times a day mom, did you get where you're going? Are you in Des Moines? Are you alright? I've got Invisalign and I and I don't have my trays in right now because if I had a man I would spit all over y'all right here so I take those out but I am so crazy that I'm gonna turn 57 on Monday thank y'all thank y'all but I've got brain fog from menopause and I can't even think of what I'm saying and I've gone around telling people I've got Instagram and I go, yeah, you do y'all are so precious to me. I wish I could go out there and straddle every one of y'all what I need to do is go home with y'all and put in a load of wash and so at the end of the routine after the two and a half minutes the finale everybody hunkers down on the stage puts their forehead on the stage and my baby is the finale she pops up and has a Little child's foot in her hand and holds that child's foot. I would put it all the way up, but my dress is tight in the back. But anyway, she holds this little child up over her head. Are y'all listening to me? I mean, it was a big deal. Husband is here and, but he's in the hotel room. I don't let him come and watch me. I know it makes me nervous and I'll tell you why. Socially, when we are out and about with our friends, I'm out there dazzling, you know, in a social situation, trying to spin a yarn in the middle of a bunch of people telling a big tale. And he's a detail person. He's an anal retentive type, a detail person. He'll say, Leanne, it was not Wednesday, it was Tuesday. It was not 2:00, it was 3:00. And I'm like, be quiet.

Something felt wrong. I grabbed his hand and bit down hard, then turned to run away, but I tripped and fell. My boyfriend closed in as I crawled desperately forward. Suddenly, he stumbled and fell. My sister appeared. She dashed into the woods.
