They hoped to find something valuable. But every time they pulled something up, it was just a pile of scrap metal. Just as they were about to give up, the magnet suddenly got stuck on something. They thought they'd found treasure. They quickly pulled together with all their strength. The next second, their faces turned pale with fear. The magnet had attracted an unexploded shell. The two immediately called the police. When the police arrived, they sealed off the area and began dredging the nearby section of the river. They quickly pulled up three cases of shells from underwater. Everyone thought the crisis was over. A few days later, a swimming competition was scheduled for this river. To avoid causing panic, the sheriff told everyone these shells were leftover from World War 2. They had long since expired. They wouldn't explode. But marine biologist Lisa noticed something unusual. Her equipment detected shark activity in the river. She immediately informed the sheriff. But the sheriff didn't believe her at all. Because sharks are ocean animals. They couldn't survive in a freshwater river. Under Lisa's repeated insistence, the sheriff had no choice but to send someone to dive into the river again. When the divers descended to 30 feet deep, they suddenly witnessed a terrifying scene.

Tony picked up a slip of paper from the ground. It was a phone number. I told them calling it would get them the grand prize. Anna dialed the number, but the person who answered was actually my lawyer. Then I took off the bear costume head. Seeing it was her husband, Anna was stunned. Just then, my daughter ran over. Anna reached out, wanting her daughter to come to her. But the girl refused. I took my daughter and walked away from her. In the end, Tony, who finally understood everything, also got ready to leave.

Anyone who loses will be crushed in the pulp by an iron ball. The rule seems simple enough. Guess the number on the dice correctly and you clear the stage. But something strange happened. The host rolled the dice three times in a row, and every time, it landed on one. Could the dice have been tampered with? On the fourth roll, the host covered the dice with a lid so no one could see the result. Players now had to trust their judgment and step into the cage that matched the number they believed was facing up. A correct guess meant splitting billions in prize money, but a wrong choice meant instant death. The timer was set for 30 minutes. From a probability standpoint, after landing on 1 3 times, the odds of it landing on one again should be very low. So 2 and 6 seemed like smarter bets. But an older man in the group disagreed. He argued that the dice must have been rigged, with its center of gravity shifted to force a certain outcome. If that was the case, this round wasn't about probability or intuition. It was about realizing the dice itself was faulty. Still, he just talked big and didn't make a move. As the crowd hesitated, a high school student stepped forward and confidently walked into cage No. 1 without a second thought. Seeing this, others rushed to follow, quickly filling the cage. Jack, the main character, Couldn't shake the feeling that he was missing something crucial. There had to be a winning strategy hidden in the rules. As more people packed into cage No. 1, Jack's nerves started to panic. If they didn't grab a spot soon, it would be too late. But instead of following the crowd, Jack calmly LED his group into cage No. 2. According to the host's earlier hint, even if you chose wrong, there was still a way to survive in the wrong cage. The real question was how?

Then I stopped a boy about to get off. I tried to gesture for his help, but Jack, a nearsighted college kid, could barely see. By the time he put on his glasses and read the note, my husband had already come to his senses. Luckily, John didn't sense anything strange. But seeing his cold, angry face, Jack knew he couldn't do anything, so he hurried off, missing the rare chance. I gathered my nerve, took off my scarf and quickly wrote the SOS message on it with lipstick. Then when John wasn't watching, I secretly tossed the scarf near the driver's seat. I thought the driver would notice at once, but to my shock, he just picked it up and walked over, yelling at me for throwing trash. Just as John tried to grab it back, I feared he'd see my message, so I snatched it first and quickly apologized, saying maybe the wind blew it there. Even so, John was still fuming with anger, but since we were in public, he could only hold it in until we got home. Just when I felt hopeless and trapped, Jack unexpectedly came back again.

He walks backwards, wears his clothes backwards, and even speaks backwards. Somehow. He also flushes the toilet the wrong way. One day, he entered a boxing match. He was different from everyone else. While others attacked their opponents, he refrained from hurting his rival and actually healed his injuries. In the end, he helped his opponent back into the chair. As he left the venue, a fan approached for an autograph. He took out a pen and started writing, but ended up erasing his own signature. Then he started his car in reverse and drove away. Back home, his girlfriend was furious at his behaviour. While she was eating, the reverser man was vomiting. Even when drinking water, the liquid seemed to multiply. His girlfriend was disappointed and seeing him in such a pathetic state, she completely lost it. She angrily argued with him, believing he didn't care about her at all. The reverser man tried to explain, but he spoke backwards so she couldn't understand a word. Heartbroken, his girlfriend decided to leave. The next day, he woke up to find a farewell letter from her. Feeling sad, he decided to chase after her, but she had already taken the car, leaving only a bicycle behind. He pedaled backwards all the way to catch up. Finally, he arrived. Just before she boarded the plane. He confronted him angrily. I love you. Hearing that, the girlfriend was moved. The reverser man worked hard to overcome His flaws for her. In the end, they reconciled smoothly.

She struggled desperately, but their cold, threatening eyes froze her into silence. At that moment, one of the men turned on a camera and started a live broadcast. They showed a mysterious liquid being injected into the girl's body and soon after, she fainted. Just a day earlier, Lisa had left home without telling her parents she was meeting her online boyfriend. When she got off the bus at the meeting spot, she saw the shoulder bag beside him, their token of love. Feeling safe, Lisa walked over. Her boyfriend handed her a drink and they got into the car. After Lisa finished drinking, she passed out. The man carried her into a dark warehouse and threw her onto a bed. Only then did Lisa realize she had fallen into a den of human traffickers. She struggled frantically, but it was too late. The traffickers tied her limbs and injected her with that mysterious liquid. They picked up a camera, filmed her and sold the video online. This abandoned warehouse was a nightmare. Hundreds of other girls locked in cages, living a life worse than death, waiting for buyers to come and purchase them at the highest price. The man in front was Alan, the buyer for the day. A girl was brought into the room, but the trafficker insisted Alan inspect the goods in person. Seeing this, Alan quietly put away his cash. The trafficker pushed the girl onto the sofa. She Was powerless to resist. Then Alan unbuckled his belt, swung it hard, knocking down several men. He was a policeman here to rescue the trapped girls. To get the exact location of the trafficking operation, Alan hung the trafficker over the balcony. Terrified, the man confessed everything. Then Alan let go, dropping the trafficker straight down.

The next second, his pet drilled into it. Fry and his group also flew their ship into the trash can and came to a desolate planet. Clothes were constantly floating in the sky, and their ship was soon crushed by the clothes. Everyone had to walk on foot. On the road, they encountered giant caterpillars. Swabberg found his old pants, but they were occupied by the professor's pet. Kara picked up a fashionable backpack and drove off the pet. The two ran towards the ship at the critical moment. Swabberg grabbed Fry's belly, but Kara was left on this planet. After returning to the company, everyone blamed the professor for destroying the planet, so the professor used a machine to lock onto the planet's coordinates. Discovered that the destroyed planet was future earth. They had been throwing waste clothes to the future, and humanity had destroyed itself with their own hands. Meanwhile, a portal appeared outside the window, and countless clothes began flying out of it, heading toward earth.

He noticed couples all around him. His heart suddenly felt hollow, longing for love of his own. When his diagnosis was placed before him, he saw a triangle on the scan. His heart sank. His neck would never be the same. In that moment, he remembered how people tilt their heads when they kiss. So he stole a billboard of a beautiful woman from the poolside. Wearing his finest suit, he bent down to kiss her picture. But no matter how hard he tried, he could never reach her lips. In the end, he even snapped the head off the billboard. Just then, he heard bird song outside. Leaning out to look, he saw a woman for the first time. Their eyes met. In that instant, they both thought, maybe this is the one. He rushed home to put on his best jacket. She fixed her hair, both longing for their first meeting. But tragically, because of their bodies and height, they circled around for a long time and still couldn't see each other. Then they walked away, one upstairs, the other downstairs, as if fate played a cruel joke. Yet in the moment, they brushed past each other. The little bird sang again. They both turned around. At last, their Eyes aligned perfectly and love began to bloom.

But as the child of a bending robot, he was expected to learn the skill. Bender handed Little Bender a small rebar, but despite his efforts, Little Bender couldn't bend it. The professor delivered devastating news. Little Bender had only one card slot and it was occupied by a memory card, meaning he might never be able to bend anything. Bender roared in despair, but vowed to give his son more love to make up for this. As little Bender grew up, a priest held a coming of age ceremony and little Bender thanked Bender emotionally. Just then, the soda machine burst in, saying it was time. To take back her son. Naturally, Bender refused, but the custody agreement, with his signature, made it impossible for him to keep his son. Bender watched helplessly as his son was taken away. And in his grief, he asked Fry to help him hide the toy he had shared with his son. But Fry had drunk too much Slurm and was now radioactive.

It's a receipt. So what? You don't need to see it. Is that how it is now, Ricky Ricardo? You have to see all my receipts when I come home when you dive on it like it's a live grenade. Yeah, I wanna see it. You know what? I just don't like this in principle because it makes me feel well, I'm just gonna say it Mike, less than and I am not less than. Let me see it. No, alright, if you don't want me to see it, then that's your business. Whatever, Mike, give it, give it to me. No, don't take that. Get me that. Get your hands. No, don't eat that. There's a present for you on there. 112 bucks for one pair of jeans. Most of that is tax. Frankie, are you kidding? Tell me there's another man somewhere that's supporting you. Okay, like I know it's crazy. It's completely crazy, but this is about sue and her self esteem. I just gave Axel a lecture about how he's gotta work for things and then you just waltz in and buy her a pair of jeans that cost more than all my pants put together. Okay, I wouldn't expect you. To understand you guys are not even gonna recognise me. So what do you think? It's just great honey. Yep. Money well spent. Oh my God. Oh my God. I did not not make drama club. Oh, well, you'll get him next time honey. No, I said not not I didn't not make it yet. I still almost maybe did make it. I gotta call back. Ah, honey, that's great. Yes. Hey mom, have you seen my new jeans? I thought it would be cool to have a fashion show after dinner and then everyone can vote on which top they think I should wear with my new jeans to the audition next week. Yeah, I brought him in here to hand wash him but I haven't gotten to it yet. The callback audition has to be a new monologue. Do you think the Crucible or Greece would show up? The jeans more. I was thinking I could do my hair all I shrunk the magic jeans. Oh no God. Take my jeans instead. You have an audition to worry about. You should go rest. But it's the middle of the day. Are you serious about this audition or not? There was no way around it. I was going to have to tell sue the truth that a burglar broke in and stole only her jeans.

Turns out old age meant she'd be killed by an old man driving a car. The second tester was an athlete. The machine spun and printed a new card. It said parachute failure. The athlete was confused. He was terrified of heights. How could he possibly die from a parachute accident? But before he could even process it, a parachute suddenly came crashing down from the sky, killing him instantly. The third tester was a middle aged man. His card read bear, and he believed it completely. From that day on, he stopped eating his favorite honey with the little bear logo. Before eating anything, he'd carefully check the ingredient list, terrified of seeing anything related to bears. His wife, unaware of all this, handed him a bowl of gummy bear candy. The man was so startled he stumbled backwards several steps. To help him relax, his wife planned an outdoor trip. But the moment they reached the wilderness, they heard a bear's roar.

The rules are simple. Grab the demon hand, say, talk to me, then say, I invite you in. A demon will enter the body of whoever's holding the hand. At first, Mia thought it was just a joke. She boldly grabbed the demon hand and said, talk to me. Her reaction was so over the top that everyone burst out laughing. Embarrassed, she decided to finish the game no matter what. This time, an even darker spirit appeared before her. Pushing through the fear, she whispered the final words, and the next second, the demon really entered her body. What the hell? Someone muttered. As Mia frozen place, her face twisted into a strange grin, and she coldly said to Jake, they like you better. Jake's smile vanished. Fear taking over, Mia's body began to change in horrifying ways. But her friends still laughed, thinking it was all part of the act. They didn't realize the danger was real. According to the rules, possession must end within 90 seconds. You have to pull the demon hand away in time, or the demon stays forever. But now the spirit had fallen in love with Mia's body, refusing to leave. Her friends panicked and tried to pull the hand off, but no one could. Suddenly, the lights went out and the 90 seconds were already up.

That night, the family went to a restaurant to celebrate and the girl's boyfriend joined them, but he seemed quite unhappy and she noticed his mood right away.

And more and more necklaces and precious gems passed through their hands, leaving the pawn shop owner completely baffled. The more profit they made, the more wealth they stacked up. And they had literal mountains of cash at their disposal. To hide their fortune, Jack even set up a secret room in the basement for storage.

So while Hercules wasn't paying attention, the boy easily bent the bar back to its original shape. Just as Hercules was about to start his next act, he suddenly noticed the bar he had just bent was straight again. So once more, he twisted the iron bar into a curve, but he didn't realize the boy was standing right beside him. At that moment, Hercules grabbed another iron rod and bent it from round to square with his bare hands. Suddenly, he saw that the iron bar had turned into a heart shape. He looked around but couldn't find anyone suspicious, so he placed the bar on the ground and secretly observed. Soon after, he saw the bar once again turning into a heart. The crowd gasped. His air whooshed around the metal. Wanting to show off his strength, Hercules prepared another trick. But suddenly he saw the boy lift the heavy iron bar with just one hand. The sight left him completely stunned. Determined to outdo the boy, he pushed himself even harder. But no matter what feats Hercules performed, the boy always did them better. Furious, Hercules put all his strength into one final move. This time, the boy clapped his hands in delight and revealed a bucket full of gold coins. Hercules laughed, shared half of it with the boy, and finally, he could afford to buy baby formula again.

Each student clutches an assault rifle. This is the final test before graduation, eliminate their professor. Even when the entire class attacks together, he dodges every bullet, for his speed is 20 times the speed of sound. Bullets slow to a crawl before him, leaving him time to make a phone call. Ordinary means couldn't defeat him, so the students devised a special weapon. It wouldn't harm ordinary people, but proved deadly to the professor's body, instantly melting one of his tentacles. Each tentacle he lost reduced his speed by 20%. Yet without the right strategy, even the most powerful weapon couldn't defeat him. That day, the class's brightest student, Redolfo, proposed a plan. He resolved to approach the professor with a hidden blade concealed behind paper, intending to strike once within striking distance. The professor anticipated this move and easily dodged the blow. Though the attack appeared to fail, the true trap lay concealed within his chest. Rodolfo had modified a special bullet into an explosive which detonated nearby. This attack harmed no humans, yet proved deadly to the professor. As the smoke cleared, only a layer of skin like substance remained on the floor. But in reality, the professor had already scaled the room ceiling, getting his skin like a snake and using it as a shield. Just when everything seemed over, the strongest freshman in the class, Lucas, stepped forward, gripped one of the professor's tentacles and Began tearing at it. In truth, Lucas had concealed a special knife, but that was merely part of the ruse. The real plan lay hidden within the rule the professor had agreed to. He promised not to harm any students until graduation and to protect them. Then Lucas drew a pistol and leaped into a deep pit. The professor faced a dilemma. If he tried to rescue himself quickly, Lucas might fall off the cliff and die. But if anyone approached to save him, they he'd be caught in the crossfire. Lucas thought he'd won, but he underestimated his opponent's power. The professor spread his tentacles, forming a net that completely blocked Lucas's dissent. Lucas could neither pull the trigger nor react. His classmates simultaneously felt both terror and awe toward the professor.

Unfortunately, her girlfriend saw the whole thing before Lisa could even explain. Emma said she just witnessed something super weird in the next room. She saw a pair of legs flailing in Madeira. The second Lucy realized her dirty little secret had been exposed, she rushed to send the guy packing. Even though he was clearly pissed. He faced right through the wall and disappeared. Lucy grabbed her things in a panic, then morphed into the guy to deal with the growing crowd outside. Meanwhile, Emma slipped into the bathroom. First, she quietly took off her jacket, then laid down a white towel in front of the toilet. She knelt down all properly and started puking non stop. By the time she was done throwing up, her body had shrunk to 1% of its original size. But that awesome superpower came with a downside. Her boyfriend always made these crazy demands and to keep him from freaking out, Emma had to shrink herself down every single day. Well, today she was officially over it. After Downing an entire bowl of rice, Emma suddenly grew over 50 times her normal size. At night, she used her gigantic hulking body and crushed her boyfriend under her own weight. He was completely helpless. At the same time, her best friend Mary had her own freaky moment in the bathroom and her period started. She saw her blood floating in the air like A red mist. She freaked out and tried to dodge it. But before she could figure out what was happening, her mom burst into the bathroom all worried about her. And that's when the freakiest part happened. The blood straight up passed.

Only then did she realize the wings were real. The girl rushed to hug the monster, repeatedly apologizing, but the monster said it wasn't her fault. His wings had been injured all along.

Some became mighty creatures like wolves, while others turned into rabbits or deer. Even the teachers could transform into giant eagles. A new boy joined the school and everyone eagerly anticipated what animal he would become. Suddenly, thick fur sprouted from his arms and he transformed into a Puma. Everyone was stunned. Test his strength, the teacher had him fight a girl who could turn into a bear. Everyone assumed the bear would lose, for though she was large and strong, her speed couldn't match the pumas. Yet after several rounds, the boy still couldn't defeat her. Seeing his weakness, the teacher decided to train him. Every day, the boy would go to the jungle to practice transforming into a Puma, to run alongside his teacher to the very edge of the forest. That was where human settlements lay, a place they must never enter. If humans saw them, they might be hunted down. One day, while the boy rested, a drone flew overhead and hunters swiftly released their dogs. Sensing danger, the boy began to run, but suddenly realized he didn't need to flee. He could transform back into a human. When he reverted to human form, even the dogs halted, stunned by what they had just witnessed.

She thought marrying a white nobleman would bring her happiness. But the day after the wedding, she was sold to a plantation. An old slave took her to work. He quickly realized Mary didn't even know how to peel potatoes. Looking closer, he saw her hands were soft with no calluses. That's when he knew Mary wasn't born into slavery. That evening, Mary told him and his son the truth and begged for help to escape. But the old slave refused, saying trying to escape would cost them their lives. Mary didn't give up. After a few days, she started adapting to the hard field. One day at the river, the plantation owner quietly appeared behind her, his eyes filled with dark intentions. Mary immediately became alert. That night, she tried to escape while everyone was asleep. But the old slave caught her. He stopped her and warned, no one ever escapes this place. He showed her scars from his own failed attempts and urged her not to do anything foolish. Far away in Canada, her parents prayed under the stars, hoping their daughter was safe and happy. They had no idea Mary was sold by her husband long ago. The next day, when no one was watching, Mary sneaked into the plantation owner's room. She grabbed an envelope and paper, planning to write a letter asking her parents to save her. But the white nobleman suddenly walked in. Luckily, he didn't notice what She was doing. Mary pretended to be looking for a book to read. Instead, the man asked her to read out loud. Mary had no choice but to comply. Halfway through, she suddenly stopped and smiled. He stuffed the book into her pocket. Just then, the master's wife saw them together. But she was already used to her husband's affairs. That evening, Mary finished writing the letter. But sending it would be hard. The postman only came once a week. She hid in a corner every day, waiting for the right moment. The old slave saw her and decided to help just this once. That day, while the postman chatted with the master, the old slave slipped the letter inside the postman's shirt, then acted like nothing happened. As the postman prepared to leave, the old slave quietly took out an iron nail and gently pricked the horse's rear. The startled horse bolted, throwing the postman off. While the master rushed to help, the old slave quickly shoved the letter into the mailbag. Though he got scolded, he smiled. After the postman left, Mary smiled for the first time in ages. Soon, her parents in Canada received the letter. Her father froze in shock. I can't believe. I can't believe this is real! He said. Her mother cried and asked, how could this happen? No, this must be a mistake. Our Mary is still at home waiting for us.

They had rented a private cruise ship. Everything was going great until the cruise suddenly broke down mid trip. They couldn't steer it and they couldn't sail back. To make it worse, the radio stopped working. No way to call for help. They were completely stranded at sea and it didn't take long before they ran out of food and water. Just when they were on the edge of dying from thirst, a strange looking vessel peered on the horizon. The people on board seemed oddly generous and offered to rescue them without hesitation. Felt like a miracle, like they were finally saved. But the moment everyone drank the water they were given, they all collapsed one by one. When Lisa finally woke up, she was horrified to find her hands tied tightly and all her friends were bound the same way.

The man ran forward, desperately trying to protect his wife. He grabbed the tadpole's tail with all his strength. Finally, he managed to pull it free. But who could have expected that the tadpole wasn't ready to give up? The confrontation between man and tadpole grew more intense. They struggled all the way from the corridor to the living room. Gradually, the situation turned in the man's favor. He held the tadpole firmly. Suddenly, he twisted its body and threw it out the window with all his might. Under the tense gaze of both, the little tadpole realized it couldn't win. It stopped resisting and quickly jumped over the wall, fleeing the scene. Meanwhile, at the other end of the park, a girl was on the phone. Unaware of the approaching danger, the dog sniffed the air and walked over to investigate. But in an instant, the creature snatched it, disappearing into the shadows. The girl noticed the rope acting strangely. She pulled it back and realized with horror that her dog was gone.

Debbie arqueó una ceja y luego sonrió con aire burlón, sin querer interrumpir la actividad que se estaba desarrollando al lado. Se quedó quieta y escuchó, pero las cosas al otro lado se pusieron tan intensas que ni siquiera se atrevía a respirar. Seguía siendo demasiado ruidoso. El alboroto continuó.

One girl quickly swallowed poison, but the other, overcome by fear, couldn't follow suit. The soldier crushed the poison pills under his boot. Just as he prepared to torture the girl, a female soldier stopped him. She said the girl could guide them through the area. However, the girl LED them into a minefield. A male soldier was instantly blown to pieces. The enraged female soldier fired into the ground, forcing the girl to keep moving forward. The girl was terrified, yet somehow they managed to survive the minefield. Shortly after, Japanese soldiers discovered them. The three fled desperately, finally hiding in tall grass to prevent the girl from screaming. A Chinese farmer covered her mouth with his clothes. Her eyes widened as if she'd stopped breathing, but she was only pretending. Fortunately, the farmer covered her mouth again just in time. The female soldier no longer trusted the girl and ordered the farmer to kill her. The farmer hated the Japanese. His mother had been killed by Japanese soldiers, but he couldn't bring himself to kill an innocent girl, so he spared her. At dusk, perhaps out of kindness, the female soldier gave the girl some food. The next day, as they crossed a narrow wooden bridge, the girl stumbled and fell into the swamp. The farmer hesitated. He didn't want to save an enemy, but in the end, he handed her A machine gun to pull herself up. When the gun slipped into her hands, his grip loosened and she swiftly pulled the trigger. Fortunately, this was merely his imagination. In reality, he still pulled the girl out of the swamp. They continued walking and finally emerged from the forest. Just then, a fighter plane crashed nearby. The girl recognized it as a Japanese aircraft. She broke free from the rope and ran to rescue the pilot, but she soon returned. The crash ignited a massive fire and the wind was too fierce. They couldn't escape the flames. Fortunately, the girl devised a clever plan. She lit a match, ordered everyone to lie flat and shielded their heads with their hands. The flames swept over them and they survived. Afterward, the trio relaxed their guard and began planning their route. The girl insisted they should head south. The female soldier thought north was better, but the farmer chose to trust the girl as she knew the area well. Yet she LED them straight into a Japanese military camp. Fortunately, it had been abandoned. The female soldier found food in an armored vehicle and called everyone over to eat. But the girl seized the chance, grabbing a machine gun and aiming it at them. The farmer walked directly toward the barrel. The girl lowered the weapon and sat down weeping. And they heard the radio broadcast. Japan had surrendered and the war was finally over. The female soldier joyfully swam into the River, the farmer, wept for his fallen comrades. The girl kept repeating, I'm sorry. Ultimately, they resolved to face the future together and embrace peace. But on their journey, they spotted several Japanese soldiers gathered together, refusing to accept defeat. Thinking they hadn't heard the news, the girl ran toward them, shouting joyfully, the war is over.

The ground began to crack open in a deeply unsettling manner. Instantly overcome by terror, he saw a monster emerge from the earth. He tried to flee in panic, but trapped between the prison walls, escape was impossible. Then an unrecognizable creature emerged from beneath the earth. Its face contorted in horror until the monster turned its head, revealing the face of a white haired old man. Seeing Nowell's terror, the old man hurriedly introduced himself, telling him he too was a prisoner in prison for 12 years. He had spent eight years digging a tunnel, only to discover he'd been digging in the wrong direction. Bruce then climbed onto Neil's shoulders. His cell had no windows. He hadn't seen sunlight in 12 years. Spending all those years utterly alone. Fortunately, he now had a companion. Bruce invited Neil to tour his cell. Upon entering, Neil was stunned. Compared to Bruce's dwelling, his own cell resembled a toilet. This space was remarkably spacious, furnished simply, and even stocked with books for leisure. But Bruce was solely focused on escape. He insisted that if they dug in the opposite direction, rescue would come within years. Now, working together, progress would accelerate. At Bruce's insistence, Neil finally agreed. But just as they prepared to start digging, footsteps sounded outside. Neil hurried back to his cell. It turned out the prison doors open twice daily. Once for garbage collection and again during dinner delivery. As long As they remained in their cells, then, they immediately began digging. Before starting the tunnel, Bruce cut off his own hair, crushed it with a Flint, and lit a homemade candle, using its light to illuminate their work. They dug during their free time, Bruce teaching Neil many techniques, which Neil diligently Learned. Three years passed. One day, while digging, Bruce discovered good news. Plant roots had broken through the soil, signaling the surface was near. Just a few more months of digging, an escape would be possible. When Neil went to fetch tools, suddenly sand and earth began collapsing. Bruce tried to retreat, but it was too late. Falling debris buried him alive. Neil rushed to the scene, dragging Bruce's body from the rubble, but Bruce's lungs had been pierced. Realizing his time was short, Bruce asked Neil to dig up the buried map and revealed that his imprisonment stemmed precisely from this treasure chart. Bruce then revealed the treasure's location to Neil. Before breathing his last breath, Neil's heart was filled with anguish. Amidst his grief, the prison guard arrived with food. Neil hurriedly hid in a corner, but forgot to place the tray by the door. The guard received no response, glanced down, and saw Bruce's body. He rushed off to find help. Seizing this moment, Neil swiftly crawled into the tunnel. Soon, guards arrived at the cell, stuffed Bruce into a body bag, sealed it tightly, and went to seek the mayor's instructions. They failed to Notice Neil still hiding in the tunnel. After the guards departed, Neil crawled out, intending to bid his mentor a final farewell. Yet a bold idea took root in his mind. Soon, the mayor arrived at the cell, showing no concern for the prison's deceased, ordering the body dumped into the sea. Yet as they exited the prison, the guards approached Neil's cell door. Finding no response, suspicion arose. The guard opened the cell door to discover Neil collapsed on the floor. When he turned Neil's body over, he realized it was actually Bruce's corpse. Neil had switched the bodies. As he tried to stop Neil, it was already too late. The warden had reached the cliff's edge. Meanwhile, Neil hid inside the body bag. The guard ran outside, shouting desperately, but the sea winds swallowed every sound. The warden heard nothing. Seeing his chance, Neil seized the warden's keys and dragged him into the sea.

At this, the two men breathed a slight sigh of relief, assuming the man had simply found a woman he liked and left. Sure enough, not long after, they received a text message from their friend saying he was already on his way home. But they didn't know that.

The ground began to crack open in a deeply unsettling manner. Instantly overcome by terror, he saw a monster emerge from the earth. He tried to flee in panic, but trapped between the prison walls, escape was impossible. Then an unrecognizable creature emerged from beneath the earth. Its face contorted in horror until the monster turned its head, revealing the face of a white haired old man. Seeing Nowell's terror, the old man hurriedly introduced himself, telling him he, too, was a prisoner in prison for 12 years. He had spent eight years digging a tunnel, only to discover he'd been digging in the wrong direction. Bruce then climbed onto Neal's shoulders. His cell had no windows. He hadn't seen sunlight in 12 years, spending all those years utterly alone. Fortunately, he now had a companion. Bruce invited Neal to tour his cell. Upon entering, Neal was stunned. Compared to Bruce's dwelling, his own cell resembled a toilet. This space was remarkably spacious, furnished simply and even stocked with books for leisure. But Bruce was solely focused on escape. He insisted that if they dug in the opposite direction, rescue would come within years. Now, working together, progress would accelerate. At Bruce's insistence, Neil finally agreed. But just as they prepared to start digging, footsteps sounded outside. Neil hurried back to his cell. It turned out the prison doors open twice daily, once for garbage collection and again during dinner delivery. As long As they remained in their cells, then, they immediately began digging. Before starting the tunnel, Bruce cut off his own hair, crushed it with a Flint and lit a homemade candle. Using its light to illuminate their work, they dug during their free time, Bruce teaching Neil many techniques, which Neil diligently Learned. Three years passed. One day while digging, Bruce discovered good news. Plant roots had broken through the soil, signaling the surface was near. Just a few more months of digging, an escape would be possible. When Neil went to fetch tools, suddenly sand and earth began collapsing. Bruce tried to retreat, but it was too late. Falling debris buried him alive. Neil rushed to the scene, dragging Bruce's body from the rubble, but Bruce's lungs had been pierced. Realizing his time was short, Bruce asked Neil to dig up the buried map and revealed that his imprisonment stemmed precisely from this treasure chart. Bruce then revealed the treasure's location to Neil before breathing his last breath. Neil's heart was filled with anguish. Amidst his grief, the prison guard arrived with food. Neil hurriedly hid in a corner, but forgot to place the tray by the door. The guard received no response, glanced down and saw Bruce's body. He rushed off to find help. Seizing this moment, Neil swiftly crawled into the tunnel. Soon, guards arrived at the cell, stuffed Bruce into a body bag, sealed it tightly and went to seek the mayor's instructions. They failed to Notice Neil still hiding in the tunnel. After the guards departed, Neil crawled out, intending to bid his mentor a final farewell. Yet a bold idea took root in his mind. Soon, the mayor arrived at the cell, showing no concern for the prison's deceased, ordering the body dumped into the sea. Yet as they exited the prison, the guards approached Neil's cell door. Finding no response, suspicion arose. The guard opened the cell door to discover Neil collapsed on the floor. When he turned Neil's body over, he realized it was actually Bruce's corpse. Neil had switched the bodies. As he tried to stop Neil, it was already too late. The warden had reached the cliff's edge. Meanwhile, Neil hid inside the body bag. The guard ran outside, shouting desperately, but the sea winds swallowed every sound. The warden heard nothing. Seeing his chance, Neil seized the warden's keys and dragged him into the sea.

That night, due to limited room availability, one of the men was taken away by a woman to another location. The remaining two men stayed in the room, spending time with the women. They didn't notice the two women exchanging a knowing glance. The next morning, after a night of debauchery, the two men woke up to find the women gone. The man who had left the room also never returned. They assumed he might have gone for breakfast, but when they checked the restaurant, he wasn't there. They went to the hotel front desk and discovered he had already checked out. This struck them as odd. Just as they were puzzling over it, a Japanese woman they'd met the previous night rushed over. She explained that her friend had also vanished suddenly, leaving behind only a photo with the missing man. At this, the two men breathed a slight sigh of relief, assuming the man had simply found a woman he liked and left. Sure enough, not long after, they received a text message from their friend saying he was already on his way home. But they didn't know that the message had been sent from the man's phone and all that remained of him was his head. After the butcher departed, they discovered the missing woman was indeed still nearby. Returning to the hotel, they relayed this unsettling news to her. The two men resolved to leave the Next day. But just then, the two beautiful women invited them once more. Lured by the women's allure, they decided to indulge one last time before departing.

The next second, the orb quickly recharged its energy. On the other side, a school bus got forced to stop by a pickup on the roadside. Seeing I was about to rush over there and noticing the women trapped inside, my friends immediately rushed over. Lisa quickly transformed into a fire person and Jack beside her instantly got what she meant. As I was about to arrive, Jack quickly positioned himself in front of the bus.

Then he slowly stood the slab up bit by Bit as I was coming over, everyone froze. They watched me. This blob of flesh slowly approached the stone slab. Just when Jack thought, I climbed over it. The next second, I actually told Jack I wanted to go home. But by then, the town had already been destroyed.

I grabbed a lipstick, rushed back into the fitting room, pressed it against my shirt to recreate what she had done. Just as I finished, my wife appeared at the door. Open the door. I'm telling you. Open the door. What? How could you do this? What? You what? Look at this photo. Why are you laughing? Gotcha. What do you mean? Imagine that brief missing short transparent on my body. I couldn't resist playing a prank on you. Then who took this photo? Huh? Did you ever hear about that? Sophie? You almost gave me a heart stroke. Don't choke like that again. Damn. And that same woman call only walked out of the fitting room pretending to be confused. She even acted curious about our argument. We explained what had happened and to my shock, I realized she was actually My wife's best friend. Then I noticed something. One of her shoes was dirty. That's when I knew the truth. She was the one who set me up. But I didn't say anything right away. After my wife left, I stopped her and said I needed her help. I picked up a dress and told her I wanted to surprise my wife with it. I asked her to try it on for me and she agreed without hesitation. But she didn't know she was walking straight into my plan. When she couldn't zip up the dress, she asked me to help. While pretending to fix the zipper, I quietly took her phone. I wanted her to feel the same trap she put me in. But before I could act, she realized what I was doing and tried to grab it back. We struggled and the noise drew my wife back to the room. The moment my wife saw what her best friend was wearing, everything finally came to light. What are you doing here together? He barged in on me. What? It's absolutely not true. Calm down. You understand everything in the moment. Siri, send this photo to my, to my husband. What are you doing? Explain yourself right now. Your friend trying to set me up. Now I'm doing the same. It's Siri. Send this photo to, to my love. It's your own fault.

Even the meat on my thighs began going loose. I was trying to get home fast, but I only made it two steps before I collapsed to the ground. In an instant, I turned into a pile of mush, then quickly burst out of the room. People around saw this freaky scene and fled in panic, causing a total traffic jam. My friends realized I'd actually turned into a monster. Lisa tried to wake me up to stop me from moving to prevent more damage, but I seem to have completely lost my hearing. I just kept moving forward. Right then, the guy with glasses took off running and the orb of light inside him seized the chance to escape, rushing to fly toward me. The next second, the orb quickly recharged its energy. On the other side, a school bus got forced to stop by a pickup on the roadside. Seeing I was about to rush over there and noticing the women trapped inside, my friends immediately rushed over. Lisa quickly transformed into a fire person and Jack beside her instantly got what she meant. As I was about to arrive, Jack quickly positioned himself in front of the bus. Everyone thought an accident was about to happen. But the next second, Jack stuck his hand straight into the ground and pried up the pavement with raw strength. Then he slowly stood the slab up bit by Bit as I was coming over, everyone froze. They watched me. This blob of flesh slowly approached the stone slab. Just when Jack thought, I climbed over it. The next second, I actually told Jack I wanted to go home. But by then, the town had already been destroyed.

The woman coldly warned him that if he wanted to live, he must become her slave and bear children for the women. Lucy was breathtakingly beautiful, her skin smooth as Jade. As she slowly shed her clothes, John completely lost the strength to resist, able only to let her do as she pleased. But he underestimated her strength. Her power far exceeded that of ordinary men. Minutes later, he could no longer endure it. Screaming in agony and begging to escape, Lucy coldly warned him that on this isolated island, no man had ever left alive, not for centuries. Her breath quickened with desire, her burning gaze locked onto him. She eagerly pounced, her hands roaming his body, dragging him into an endless cycle. All night long, John was drained of every ounce of strength. While the woman's gaze grew even more intense, John felt an inexplicable dread. As time passed, the truth gradually unfolded. The tribe's men had long been extinct. These women possessed insatiable lust. Every man who fell into their clutches was ultimately drained dry, left nothing but a withered husk. From that day on, the women hunted men with frenzied abandon, forcing them into breeding tools. John dreaded becoming the next victim. Terror filled his heart as he attempted escape time and again, only to fail repeatedly. Finally, he chose to submit. Yet fate toyed with them once more. The next Day, while hunting in the forest, a band of raiders suddenly appeared. They attacked the pair, seizing Lucy and locking her in a dark room. Rough hands groped her body. The men had never seen skin so pale and delicate. They threw her roughly onto the couch, threatening to take her as their bride. The man approached. Step by step, his voice grew colder. Lucy forced herself to stay calm, but her heart pounded wildly. Staring at his ugly face, Lucy struggled desperately, crying out in Defiance. She tried every means to escape, but was ultimately cornered with no way out. Tears filled her eyes. The real nightmare had only just begun.

Each student clutches an assault rifle. This is the final test before graduation. Eliminate their professor. Even when the entire class attacks simultaneously, the professor evades every bullet, for his speed reaches 20 times the speed of sound. Bullets slow to a crawl before him, leaving him time to make a phone call. Defeating him by conventional means was impossible, so the students devised a special weapon. One harmless to ordinary people, yet deadly to the professor's body, capable of instantly melting one of his tentacles. Each tentacle lost reduced his speed by 20%. Yet without the right strategy, even the most powerful weapon couldn't defeat him. That day, the class's brightest student, Rodolfo, devised a plan. He resolved to approach the professor with a paper concealing a dagger, striking once within range. But the professor anticipated this move, effortlessly evading the attack. The attempt seemed futile. Yet the true trap lay concealed against his chest. Rodolfo had modified a special bullet into an explosive, detonating it nearby. This attack wouldn't harm humans, but posed grave danger to the professor. When the smoke cleared, only a thin layer of skin remained on the floor. In reality, the professor had scaled the room ceiling, shedding his skin like a snake, using it as a shield. Just as everything seemed over, the strongest freshman in the class, Lucas, stepped forward. With a powerful grip, he began tearing at the professor's tentacles. In Truth, Lucas concealed a special knife. But this was merely a ruse. The real plan lay hidden within the rules. The professor had promised not to harm any students until graduation and to protect them. So Lucas drew a gun and leaped into a deep pit. The professor faced a dilemma. If he tried to rescue himself quickly, Lucas might fall to his death. But if anyone approached to save him, they would be caught in the crossfire. Lucas believed he had one, but he underestimated his opponent's power. The professor unfurled his tentacles, forming a net that completely halted Lucas's descent. Lucas could neither pull the trigger nor react. His classmates simultaneously felt both fear and awe toward the professor.

When the computer powers on, all the key characters stand at attention, ready to start another day's shift. Unfortunately for them, their owner is a hardcore gamer. The moment the game begins is fingers start flying across the keyboard, and the key characters have no choice but to follow the chaos. Some squat non stop, others drop down one after another in endless repetition. Less than 30 minutes in, the most used keys are already drenched in sweat, running themselves ragged, but never daring to stop. Even on the brink of collapse, they still obey every command without hesitation. By the 45 minute Mark, each his fate looks completely different. The busiest ones are sprinting on treadmills just to keep up, while the less used keys stand to the side cheering them on. And those that are almost forgotten? They're lounging on massage chairs, sipping red wine and watching the chaos unfold. But the poor tab key, the most abused of them all, lies in a hospital bed waiting to hear its diagnosis. Meanwhile, the two enter keys, also heavily overworked, are popping pills and worrying about their future. Just when things seem hopeless, a savior appears. The owner's wife coming in to call him for dinner. The moment she enters the room, the alt and tab keys take a massive hit. The tab key gets slammed so hard his character dies instantly. The entire keyboard Falls silent in shock. Only when the owner frantically switches from the game to a work document can all the key characters finally breathe a sigh of relief. But the second his wife walks out of the room, the owner's next move makes every single key scream in terror all over again.

Seeing how strong the armor was, the king immediately stopped and rejected the piece of dragon skin. Suddenly, a fierce dragon appeared in the sky.

To help him relax, his wife planned an outdoor trip. But as soon as they reached the wild, they heard a bear's roar. The man panicked and grabbed a weapon for Protection. Even when he slept at night, he refused to put it down. The next morning, the man woke up safe and sound. He thought the machine had fooled Him. So he rushed back home and pulled out his favorite honey with the bear logo. He was ready to enjoy it to his heart's content. But the next second. In the end, his doom found him.

Once it locks onto someone, that person is completely trapped. Only when the demonic box is passed to the next target can the original holder regain their freedom. When the doctor first saw the box, he immediately sensed something was wrong, but he didn't take it too seriously. He only instructed his assistant to keep a close eye on it. However, the assistant made a mistake, falling right into a trap set by the previous holder and was forced to take the box. By the time he realized what was happening, it was already too late. He helplessly watched as the two former holders turned into starlight and vanished without a trace. At this point, the doctor had no idea what had happened to his assistant. The assistant, before disappearing, had passed the box to a lizard man. The doctor finally traced the box again and quickly tried to contact his assistant, but only heard his last desperate words before he, too, dissolved into Starlight. That's when the doctor realized the situation was extremely critical. The Lizard Man noticed the doctor watching him and tried to hand him the box, but the doctor remained highly alert. A woman standing nearby witnessed their confrontation and suddenly stepped forward, snatching the box. The next second, she was completely controlled by it. The Lizard Man snapped back to reality, but it was too late. He began to fade away. Before the doctor could say goodbye, the woman Rushed toward the door, ready to continue spreading the cursed box, the doctor quickly opened it to save her, only to discover it contained a miniature planet. Even stranger, the box began to speak. Please, we seal the s C containment unit within 20 seconds or the current case holder will be disintegrated with extreme prejudice. With only 20 seconds left, Doctor Harley frantically searched for a way to unlock it. The countdown ticked relentlessly and he still had no solution. The woman pleaded anxiously, urging him to close the box. Next moment, quiet. I'm tired of noise. The doctor pressed the lid shut, but the danger wasn't over.

Dude, come on. Kicking a ball is like the easiest thing in the world. It's this. Then why can't I do it? I don't know. You miss every time you look at the ball. Maybe you should just close your eyes and kick. Okay. Whoa! I did it! I kicked the ball! I know! That was awesome! You're like a Jedi Knight or something. That was the coolest thing I've ever seen. Ha ha ha! Come on! Spending time that day with Axel was one of the greatest moments in Brick's young life. In fact, it was so great that brick didn't want it to end. Alright, you kicked the ball. Now where's my report? I even misspelled Harpoon, so she'll think you wrote it. Wait a minute, where's the rest? This is supposed to be like 20 pages.

Suddenly, one day, she fainted at work. A trip to the hospital revealed that she had AIDS. The woman found it unbelievable. She had always kept herself clean. She had never been to inappropriate places. How could she have AIDS? But the doctor firmly stated that the test results were not wrong. The woman couldn't help but suspect it was her husband who had infected her. However, they had always loved each other deeply. The man was busy with work with no time for affairs. The woman didn't tell him the truth about her condition. Afraid of infecting him with the virus, she intentionally kept her distance from him. But over time, the man still noticed her strange behavior. After his comforting, the woman finally told him the truth. The man was bewildered, stammering to ask her if she had been with anyone else. After getting a negative answer, he felt a little relieved. Early the next morning, the whole family went to the hospital to get tested. The man and his son were healthy. Only the woman had AIDS. That night, he solemnly apologized to him for having unjustly suspected him and again affirmed that she hadn't done anything dirty. The man showed little reaction, calmly proposing a divorce and wanting to take their son with him. After their divorce, the man forbade her from seeing her son. Devastated, she decided to leave the city and start A new life. However, at that moment, an accident occurred.

To force her to surrender, the kidnapper turned on the valve and icy water poured in with a violent rush. The water level kept climbing higher, and Anna felt hopeless, unsure how much longer she could hold on. She struggled with all her might, trying to break free, but every effort was in vain. Soon the water rose above her head and she began choking. Her cries for help drowned out completely. As the air ran out, dizziness and panic set in. At that moment, the kidnapper actually fired bullets into the tank, sending Anna into a panic. She dodged desperately underwater, heart pounding, not daring to relax for even a second. Luckily, she managed to avoid all the bullets, but her energy was nearly spent. The kidnapper, enraged, jumped into the water, planning to finish it all himself. Just as he let his guard down, Anna seized her one chance. Didn't realize she could hold her breath for half an hour underwater. She lunged suddenly, gripping his neck tightly, leaving him no way to escape. The kidnapper realized the danger too late. Thrashing wildly but completely overpowered, Anna gritted her teeth, holding on with every ounce of strength. The underwater struggle fierce and brutal. Soon the kidnapper's body went limp and he never surfaced again.

When under attack, never take cover behind the side of a vehicle. Instead, position yourself at the front where the engine is. It offers the best Protection when throwing a grenade inside a building. Never throw it too hard. It could bounce back and injure you. The right way is to roll it along the floor into the room. This ensures it can effectively take out the enemy. And don't try to pull the pin with your teeth like in the movies. The metal ring is so tough it could take your teeth with it, unless you want an urgent trip to the dentist. To avoid running out of ammo during an intense night firefight, load a few green tipped tracer rounds first, then follow with regular rounds. This lets you know exactly when to swap magazines. When searching for the enemy, never close one eye to aim. Keep both eyes open so you can spot more potential threats. If you see flashes from gunfire in the bushes, watch the barrels direction to locate the enemy. If it points to the right, move right and fire. This is how you can take down an enemy hiding in the forest. When ambushed around a corner, the enemy might try to circle around and hit you from behind. In that case, you must act unexpectedly and catch them off guard. Everyone knows a weapon is the most important tool For survival on the battlefield, if you lose it, you're completely vulnerable. So always keep your rifle strapped around your neck. And when carrying it on your back, make sure the barrel points downward. This allows you to fire quickly when facing the enemy. When storming a building, stick close to the wall and watch the doorway. This way you can immediately spot the enemy. Never open interior doors lightly because the enemy may have set traps or explosives behind them. In open terrain, the first priority is to dig a trench. But don't just dig a random ditch. Make an angled turn roughly every 10 meters. This gives you time to counter attack during an enemy assault. Once the trench is ready, build underground shelters as well. They provide Protection against enemy drone strikes and keep you safe from aerial bombs. As for empty bottles and cans after meals, never throw them away. Carelessly collect them to create a makeshift alert system. Once you hear a sound, you can react immediately. When scouting the enemy, never stick your head out. You could be shot instantly. The proper way is to use binoculars for observation. Even in times of war, you must use your head to survive.

Lucas had just been kicked out of his house when he encountered a large group of women in a train compartment. Soon after, a woman pulled him to a seat and the women around him stared at him non stop. The way they looked at him made Lucas feel completely uneasy. He just couldn't take it anymore. Eventually he. He had to sneak away quietly. But as he reached the station entrance, he ran into Tom, who was in the exact same situation. They decided to stick together and escape from these women. For four days and nights they kept moving, exhausted and on the edge of collapse. Then they saw people eating ahead. As they got closer, they realised there were even two men among them. Starving, they immediately sat down to eat, thinking that after the meal they could continue their journey. But in the next moment, a swarm of women rushed toward them. Only then did they realise the men they had been eating with were actually women. Into the hospital, where eager nurses surrounded them, all staring at them with longing eyes. Skies they were taken. The head nurse examined them and confirmed they were healthy. But that also meant they would soon face a different kind of torment. Who could have known that after just two nights, these two young men would age into older men, their hair turning white.

Then why doesn't it feel that way? Cause sometimes I look at you Toby and I don't even know who you are anymore I don't you drink expensive champagne you're not a work a room you're not the guy who wore those terrible Hawaiian shirts would make those loud inappropriate jokes you're not the guy who asked for the wine list and says bring me the whole left side the goofy guy from our first date, the old Toby guy that I fell in love with. I miss him. I miss him so much that I've been picturing him this weekend here with me so this whole time that I've been thinking that we're really connecting, you've just been imagining yourself with a different version of me. That is not what I said. That's not what I'm saying. Is he here? Don't do that. Is he here now? Oh, you know, maybe we should just we should get him out here. Hey, let's get old Toby out here here to join in on this fun huh? Hey, you know you know what I'd love to say to old Toby Kate? He was a mess. He was miserable and insecure and self loathing and all all of That goofiness and the loud jokes, that was out of self defense, Kate. You fell in love with a coping mechanism. And FYI, if that guy hadn't changed, he would have jumped off a bridge or died of a heart attack making a joke at his own expense. Wait, I almost did that last part.

Jack would always close the office door with a remote control, then mess around with the secretary for half an hour. But just a few days earlier, Jack was about to fire Anna. The reason? Anna was really clumsy and absent minded. As a secretary, she often messed up the tasks Jack gave her and even made mistakes with simple things like buying a drink. Jack couldn't take it anymore, so he fired her. But that night, while Jack was cleaning up Anna's desk, he found some intimate photos she'd left on her computer. And these photos were even taken in the office. This discovery made Jack feel a rush of heat. He'd never seen Anna look so sensual before. So the next day when Anna was about to leave, Jack stopped her, apologized and begged her to stay as his secretary. Seeing the change in Jack's attitude, Anna seemed to figure it out. She decided to keep working for him and told him that if she made another mistake, he could punish her however he wanted. But at that moment, Jack still didn't understand what Punisher meant. Just a few minutes later, Anna swapped Jack's coffee for hot water. Jack was furious, almost deducting money from her salary. But And Anna threw the cup on the ground in a provocative way. Jack was surprised, but in the next moment, Anna lifted her hips and asked Jack to punish her. It was then that Jack finally understood what punish her however he wanted really meant.

Days later, the absences started. Girls missing class, excuses about stomach pain, doctor visits, not feeling well. Until parents began running into each other in the same clinic for the same reason. And that's when the truth came out. Every clue pointed back to that night.

One day when the young woman was driving to the school to pick up her two sons, she heard the Siren behind her. She was very scared because she knew it was the police, but she had no idea what they were doing. Then she stopped. A policeman got out of the car and asked her for her driver's license and registration certificate. Then the policeman asked her if she knew her tail light was broken. Selena responded to him with a hint of helplessness, admitting that she was indeed aware of the problem. But she explained that the necessary repair cost was as high as $600, which was daunting and she was worried that she could afford it. The police sensed the change in the conversation and then asked her to open the trunk of the car. In this unexpected turn of events, Selena's heart accelerated with anxiety.

Parents were told everything would be strictly supervised, teachers on duty all night, full security, nothing to worry about. But that turned out to be a lie. After midnight, the teachers gathered in the staff lounge, poured themselves a few drinks, laughed a little too loudly, and one by one they fell asleep. Meanwhile, the students were wide awake.

A sharp pain hit her stomach and the creature began crawling toward her brain. She started losing her mind trying to call for help, but her best friend was too busy playing games. Her eyes rolled back and she dropped to the floor, completely out cold. Just a minute earlier, Lisa had walked to the sink to wash her hands, but the water suddenly turned thick and sticky. She stared at it, confused what was going on. Then out of nowhere, an eel shot up from the drain and dived straight into her shorts. Lisa froze. Her body stopped responding. That eel came from her own lab. Lisa was a bio research scientist working on a virus that could merge with eels, push the human body beyond its limits. But one got loose and anyone taken over by it would start sweating non stop, just like Lisa. Now barely able to move, she stumbled into the living room hoping her friend could help, not realizing what was creeping up behind her. At the same time, another worm slithered up through the toilet. When her friend went to sit down, creature struck, burrowing straight into her brain. Moments later, both of them broke through human limits. The experiment was finally a success.

It wasn't a serious matter. Her older sister could scold her a bit and that would be enough. But the white plantation owner was very displeased. He thought it disturbed the invited guests and insisted on punishment. Even the white lady next to him pleaded for the black slave. But the plantation owner wouldn't back down. He insisted that his wife punished the girl in front of everyone. Get her. You go now, girl. After the girl sadly left, the man calmly had his servant pour him a drink, almost as if showing off his treatment of slaves. That evening, Emma told sunny to follow the rules or she'd have to work in the fields. Honey cried, but she was also angry, swearing to get revenge on the hateful white plantation owner. The next morning, the girl quietly sneaked into the kitchen when no one was around. She hadn't had the chance to admire the things she hadn't seen yesterday. Today, she curiously looked around, and when she saw the delicate silverware, she couldn't help but play with it in her hands. Just then, the mistress happened to notice her. Sunny quickly put the items down, but she couldn't avoid a harsh scolding from the plantation owner's wife. Luckily, Emma stepped in just in time, criticizing the girl's behavior and preventing further punishment. But it wasn't over yet. As the mistress left, he left a stern warning, if I catch you misbehaving, Again, I'll throw you into the fields to work in the big house. Sunny had to not only clean, but also look after the plantation owner's young son. So she walked into the young master's room and without realizing it, lay down on his big bed, enjoying a comfort she had never felt before. What she didn't notice was a little boy quietly watching her. I can't take care of the child. The child's almost grown and he ain't even house broke. Change him fast and do your best now. We are waiting on you.

You know he made it up, you know? I saw your file in Tucker's desk. It was pretty thick. How many other guys have you been a little too friendly with? Has your son ever been taught his actions have consequences? Hunter, let's go. No. When we stay here, unless it's some more parenting advice from a child molester, you let him lie and charm his way out of trouble, you're not doing him any favors. Lieutenant Tucker, this guy's stalking me now. I was on my way to see you. Funny I didn't send for you. Well, I thought I'd save you the trouble. We've been trying to leave, but that man won't let us stable in my office. I, I'm the one who needs a Protection order. I. I was molested by whom? Creepy guy at the precinct where they took me. Detective Stabler. Hey, that's not cool. Don't touch me there, man. I need an adult in here. Quit touching my junk. Detective, is there a problem? Yeah, the kids are smart ass. Think that's funny? No. Then why did you yell that? I freaked out. It's my first time being arrested. Well, I was just heading out on patrol. You need me to send somebody in? It's talking to you, not me. No, no, we're cool. We're cool. Face the wall. I was totally wasted and I had no idea what I was doing. Skip the editorializing, Mr Maslyn. If you can't take responsibility for your actions. Ellie, I can't. Not the time. Ellie, don't let him do this. Call for recess. Is there a problem, counselor? No, we need to call recess, your honor, please. We have a restraining order against that man. He's not supposed to be within 500 feet of my client. I am just trying to prevent a miscarriage of justice here, your honor. I want him arrested. Court officer, please escort him out. Nelson, what happened? Tell your partner. I was never looking to get caught up. Trust me. We know how the rat squad works. What did you tell them? The truth. And they know it's a bogus claim. Look, every drug bust I ever made claimed I planted the evidence. So feel that good. So you explain to Tucker that Elliot's being set up. All I could tell him was what I heard and what I saw. I couldn't lie. What do you think you saw your partner backing up off the kid. When he heard me come behind him, you saw that he was just uncuffing the kid. I couldn't see his hands from my angle. You let this kid play you. What happened? I see. You got my message. Rape victim Madeline Harris, 50s, looks like a businesswoman, skirt hiked up, throat slit. Any witnesses? The wino her killer plowed into. And he was high tailing and out of there. He said he was dressed all in black, reeked of Whiskey and had pantyhose pulled over his face. Tim, we don't know that. The witness said he was slender, 5 10, dark hair, looked like a kid. It's hunter mazing. He's pissed off the conditions they placed him under or he was celebrating. Those clothes you're wearing don't even fit you. Well, you certainly know how to make a guy feel self conscious. Mrs. Mayslin, are those the same clothes he was wearing the last time you saw him? I didn't see what he changed into after court. Are they even his? Yes, they're his. Right. And I suppose he doesn't appear intoxicated to you either. I am sober. As a judge, hunter, you know sobriety is a condition of his probation. I want you to blow in this thing, please. Um, are you really gonna let them do this to me? It'll be fine. You weren't drinking?

I don't have a cell phone, sir. Well, then what's. It's a robot for our project. When do you think I was born? Depends. How old are you now? There's no school policy to cover this one. So the good news, we can all put this incident behind us. My daughter gets her hands on this filth and we're supposed to put it behind us. It's not yours. Of course it's. Oh, mine. Oh, sick. It's mine. Oh, why won't you look at. I don't wanna discuss this now. I'm sorry. You're not having sex, are you? Of course not. So why would you be interested in a thing like that? I barely know what it's for, but everyone at school does. I guess I never expected you to be interested in sex toys. But I'm, I'm not. I just, I'm not using them, but I am curious about other things. Let's talk about them. How'd it go with the parental unit? My mom answered most of my questions. It was informative. My mom would never talk to me about that kind of stuff. I think that's just for me to know. Starting with sex toys early, little Edwards, what would Jesus say? That masturbation is normal and no one should be Embarrassed about it, really. And if you tried it once in a while, maybe you wouldn't be so mean.

Maybe he's all wrong for me, and I just can't see it because it feels so good to hang out with a nice guy for once. But before you commit. You know when I told you to stay away from my brother?

We've been married five years when she got the news, some procedure she had in her early 20s meant kids weren't happening. The doctor explained it gently, but I watched her face just crumble in that office. She didn't say a word the entire drive home. At first, I thought we'd work through it together. I told her we could adopt, we foster, hell, we didn't even need kids if she didn't want them. I married her, not the idea of being a father. I loved her for who she was. But she completely shut down, said intimacy was only for making babies. And since that wasn't possible anymore, we were done. Just like that. No discussion, no compromise. She moved into the guest room that same week. Two years. Two years of sleeping in separate rooms, two years of her flinching away when I tried to hold her hand. Two years of feeling like a roommate instead of a husband. Two years of eating dinner in silence while she scrolled through her phone. I tried everything. I bought her flowers, planned date nights, suggested weekend getaways. Nothing worked. She'd accept the flowers with a blank thank you and cancel the reservations. I started going to therapy by myself because she refused couples counseling. Every time I brought it up, she'd say there Was nothing to talk about. My therapist suggested I write her a letter, something she could read without feeling cornered. So I did. I spent weeks on that letter. My counselor helped me choose every word carefully. I told her I loved her, that I missed her, that I wanted us to try therapy together. I asked if she'd consider seeing a doctor. Maybe there was something physical going on beyond the infertility. I explained how lonely I felt, how much I missed being her husband. I made sure nothing could be read as manipulative. I wanted her to know this came from love. I left it on the kitchen table one morning before work right next to her coffee mug. When I came home that evening, she'd read it. I could tell because there was red Sharpie scrolled across the entire page. Go get it elsewhere because you're not getting it from me. That was it. No conversation. She wrote those words and walked out to her sister's place for the weekend, didn't answer my calls, didn't respond to texts. I sat at that table for over an hour just staring at her handwriting. Part of me was angry. Part of me was devastated. But mostly I just felt empty, hollow. Then I made a decision. If that's what she wanted, if she was giving me explicit permission and writing, then okay, I take her up on it. I'm not the kind of guy who can just go, go To a bar and pick someone up. I'm decent looking, keep in shape, can hold a conversation, but I'm no model. I'm just a regular guy with a good job and a dead marriage. So it took time. I met Nadia at a work conference three months later. We got coffee between sessions, started texting about work stuff. She knew I was married from day one. I made that crystal clear. She was coming out of a bad divorce herself and wasn't looking for anything serious. We were both just lonely people who understood what it felt like to be abandoned. It started as genuine friendship, someone to talk to who didn't make me feel broken or unwanted, someone who laughed at my jokes and actually seemed happy to see me. Then one night after a few drinks at a hotel bar, it became physical. I didn't hide it. I left my phone face up on the counter, didn't delete message.

Riley was that person. Not crazy like she lit stuff on fire or got arrested. Crazy like she just didn't care what anyone thought. And I mean that in the best way possible. She dyed her hair purple with Kool Aid in 8th grade, started a petition to ban homework, and got 400 kids to sign it before the principal shut it down. She wore a Dinosaur onesie to school on random Tuesdays just because she felt like it. But what she pulled during senior prom was actually insane. Our high school was super clicky. You know the type. The popular kids always won everything. Prom king and queen were basically reserved for whoever had the most Instagram followers. It was predictable and honestly, kind of boring. Every year, same type of people, same fake speeches about unity and memories. Riley hated that. She'd been complaining about it since junior year. It's always the same six people winning everything, she'd say. What's even the point? So when prom nominations opened up in April, Riley did something nobody saw coming. She nominated her dog for prom queen. Yeah, her actual dog, a golden retriever named Marley. At first, we all thought she was just messing around. Riley did stuff like that all the time. But then she started printing posters. Like, actual campaign posters. They said, vote Marley for Queen with photos of her dog wearing a Little crown she bought from Party City. She made buttons, too. Hand put them out in the cafeteria, put them on people's backpacks when they weren't looking. Most people laughed. Some people thought it was dumb, but everyone kind of loved it because it was so random. Here's the thing, though. Riley was smart about it. On the nomination form, she didn't write Marley the dog. She wrote M. Reynolds. That was technically Marley's legal name on her vet papers. Riley's mom had registered her that way as a joke years ago, and Riley never forgot. So when the school posted the final five nominees for prom queen, there it was, M. Reynolds, right next to Kelsey Grant and Madison Cole and all the usual suspects. Nobody on the staff connected the dots. They just saw a name. By the time someone figured it out, voting had already closed, the ballots were in, and apparently a lot of people had voted for M. Reynolds as a joke. Or maybe because they were tired of the same people winning. Either way, it was too late to change anything. From night came, Riley showed up in this deep red dress she'd thrifted. But she also brought Marley, like, actually brought her dog, to prom. Security tried to stop her at the door, but she had printed out some fake emotional support animal paperwork she made on Canva. It looked legit enough that they just let her through. The prom court was announced Halfway through the night, they called up the five girls. Kelsey and Madison were up there looking all perfect in their sparkly dresses. And Riley walked up holding Marley in her arms. The dog had a tiny matching red dress on. People started laughing. Some were confused. The vice principal looked like he wanted to crawl into a hole. Then they opened the envelope and your senior prom queen is M. Reynolds! The gym exploded. People were screaming. Half the room was dying laughing. The other half was cheering. Kelsey's face went bright red. Madison looked like she

After my little sister dropped an F bomb at dinner, my dad went into full moral panic mode and announced new rule anyone who swears puts a dollar in this jar. We're becoming a respectable household. He sets up this fancy Mason jar on the kitchen counter like it's some sacred artifact. Every curse word, one dollar. No exceptions. This family is going to learn some class. Day one, mom accidentally says damn while cooking and grudgingly puts in a dollar. My brother drops crap and does the same. I slip up with the s word and fork over my money. Dad's beaming, thinking he's a parenting genius, but by day three, we're all getting creative. My brother starts saying fudge and sugar like he's some 1950s cartoon character. Mom invents this weird hissing sound whenever she's frustrated. Sounds like a deflating balloon mixed with a pissed off cat. I just start speaking in Spanish curse words, and dad can't prove anything because he failed high school Spanish twice. Dad's getting suspicious, though. He's following us around like a curse word detective. Ears perked up, ready to pounce. What did you just say? He keeps asking. Nothing, dad. I said gosh darn. That sounded like something else. Your ears are broken, old man. He starts carrying around this little notebook, trying to catch us in the act like some discount FBI agent. Meanwhile, the little shit who started this Whole mess. My sister is making bank. She's ratting us out left and right, pointing fingers like she's working for the FBI. Mom said the B word. Dad, he said ass. He's turned into a tiny dictator, drunk on power and planning to buy a pony with her commission money. The jar is getting fuller, but it's mostly our money. While dad struts around like he's reformed the whole family. See how civilized we've become? He says, adjusting his imaginary tie like he's some kind of etiquette expert. Meanwhile, we're all internally screaming profanities we can't afford to say out loud. The jar is becoming this evil presence in our kitchen, mocking us with every clink of coins. Then comes Saturday morning. Dad's trying to fix the garbage disposal, muttering what he thinks are whispered curse words. We can all hear him from upstairs. Stupid piece of garbage, why won't you. He's trying so hard to be good, it's actually painful to watch. Suddenly we hear this massive clang. And then the most epic string of profanity I've ever witnessed in my life. F word. S word.

Women of the future no longer want to give birth themselves because they can simply go to the supermarket and select the baby they like. Anna quickly took a liking to a 100 pound baby. When she brought the infant to the checkout counter, Anna suddenly changed her mind. She remembered that her husband was black, but all the babies in the supermarket were white. To avoid creating conflict with her husband, Anna decided to abandon the direct purchase plan. But they still didn't need traditional childbirth methods. They could simply have doctors collect DNA from both parties to cultivate their own biological child. Soon, Anna and her husband signed their agreement. They could even watch their child's birth process. Yeah, we have a fertilized egg. In their subsequent life, Anna constantly monitored the baby, whether she was working or resting. She would even feed the baby various nutrients through an app. A month later, Anna couldn't wait to visit the hospital to see her baby. She imitated other mothers by stroking the egg. But Anna had a strange feeling that night. She had a dream where, during her delivery, the doctor actually removed a small chicken egg from her belly. This made her begin to feel that everything was so unreal. Watching other people's pregnant bellies, she felt incredibly envious. Fortunately, two months later, the doctor said they could take the egg home to raise. They agreed without hesitation because this Way they could truly experience the joy of being parents in their future life. The baby in the egg grew bigger and bigger under their careful care. The man would even read fairy tales to the baby. Soon the baby grew to 8 months old. But when the couple took the baby for a checkup, the doctor actually said they needed to let the baby be born prematurely. The reason given was that the hospital's eggshells were in short supply and they needed to provide eggshells for the next couple. But neither spouse wanted their child to be born prematurely. So the man made a bold decision. Secretly stole the egg from the hospital. Then they packed their luggage and went to their hometown 10,000 km away. Now they didn't have to worry about the hospital coming after them for an eggshell. In such a beautiful environment, they finally experienced the true joy of being parents. Until this morning. When the eggshell played music. They instantly realised it was time for the baby to be born. They immediately rushed downstairs with the baby in panic. But they were horrified to discover that the eggshell required a password to open.

Yeah, so I remember so I remember meeting you in the crypt of the Basilica and yeah, yeah, so I remember that and then I thought what is Charlie Kirk doing here? I know he's a Protestant like you know like what is this? Um, and to clarify I am a conservative so I don't really have much like political disagreements with you whatsoever but what I'm going to try to do if you permitted, if you permit me to do it is simply the layout why I believe that the. Do it quick. Sure no problem no problem at all no problem at all no problem at all so 30 seconds if that's okay. Sure so I believe that the protopsis theoryology is an error um, as in for example as John Calvin and Martin Luther explicitly states they believe that when Christ descended into hell that this was the father damning the son which causes a split within the divine Trinity this undermines divine simplicity as it reduces god into parts the Catholic alternative to this is that when god descended into hell that it was not our Lord Jesus Christ in His divinity being passioned, but that it was merely him as a passionless divine person coming into the bosom of Abraham and releasing the patriarchs of the Old Testament so, um, love the question. Yeah, love the thoughtfulness. I wanna spend our time together on stuff that's not gonna lose the audience. Sure. Um, if that's okay, that's okay. But, but you're Catholic I'm Protestant, but I think we can both agree we want every single person on this campus across the country to bring their life to Jesus. Can we both agree on that? We should and, and, and you believe that that is through the Catholic Church, correct? I do. Um, I do not believe that, but I understand that I think there's great beauty in the Catholic Church. Sure. There is phenomenal truth in the Catholic Church. Personally, I'll just end with this. Uh, I have difficulty with Mariology. Okay? Uh, the idea of the Vatican and the Pope and finally, uh, the Eucharist being transubstantiation. Those are my three main contentions. Yeah, I don't want to spend our time with that together. That's all right. If I can just say, if you can, uh, at the very least just sort of study up on the soteriology and what I said. Uh, you can look, I will. No, He's fine.

So let's all calm down a little bit. But, um, first of all, I wanna begin with a yes or no question. Is that cool? Okay. Do you think that we see more divisiveness in our country today than we have in modern American history, let's say within the last 30 years? Okay. Um, so then I will then begin what I have written down so that way I can get my point across clearly. Is that, is that okay? Okay. What I personally believe is the future for this country is for us to be able to reunite in a sense. It's my opinion that since the start of Trump's first term in 2016, we have seen an unquestionable increase in hate crimes and political violence. January 6, we can talk about that one. What is your opinion on the divisiveness of it? What is your opinion on the divisiveness perpetuated by the Trump administration? Um, if you think there is any at all, do you, uh, do you have any issue the fact that the first time Riley came to campus here, she had to be barricaded for multiple hours cause left wing students tried to physically attack her. Okay. So is that divisive? So even I, I, I went to, I went physically put themselves. I don't consider myself a Liberal. I think that's fine. But no, but you Have to be morally correct. You're going after the Trump. Right. Right, right. Right. When, when Riley was barricaded the current city president. Right. When, when Riley was barricaded on this campus, were they wearing MAGA hats? Uh, okay. So again, I just heard of your name today. I don't even know. I don't, I didn't even know who. Yeah. But I mean, just, just the point though is that it's, it's the left that's dividing this country. We're bringing this country together. Okay. This is very simple. Okay, that's fine. Can I ask you a follow up question then? Can you cite any quote of any city democratic president between the last 3 and we, we can count Kamala cause she was a candidate, but Obama, Biden or Kamala, um, saying anything. Oh, actually, we will discount Biden saying that Trump supporters are trash, but any other time saying that they're the enemy within which Trump has used the enemy evil. They call them Nazis every week. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Again, a President Joe Biden gave a speech in November 2,022 right before the midterms in front of Independence Hall. I would say to see a quote. Yes. Saying that quote, there was a, there is a rise of white supremacy and fascism that must be stomped out of the country. I'm paraphrasing, but again, literally calling half the country fascists and coming after us. That's exactly what he did. In fact, he said, in fact, up he said Ultra MAGA is a threat to the country. MAGA. Keyword. MAGA. I think, yeah, there's a difference between MAGA and Republicans. He said that everyone wearing here a red hat is a threat to the homeland. Joe Biden declare they are. The amount of times, the amount of times that guy right there.

And also my question is how much more money do you think we should give to Israel at this point? Probably very little. I mean they, I think they have proper amount of funding. I think the more important operative question is do you think that Israel is the good actor in the Middle East? And I believe they are, especially versus their radical Islamic neighbors but I'm America First and I think we've given a very generous amount of money to Israel right now and you they should be allowed to do as they see fit in the region and protect themselves. Amen. Amen. That's right. Amen. Well, to answer your question, I don't really think there's any good actors over there. I think both of them don't touch it. Alright, my bad. I don't think both Israel or Hamas are doing themselves any favors. That's my okay. That's fine. Do you have any other thoughts about that? No. Okay. Uh, do you, do you think that what happened to Israel on October 7th was evil and wrong? Yeah. Okay, good. We agree. Alright, thank you. Have a good one. Yeah, you too. Let's go. Charlie, you got this. Thank you. Uh, real quick, I just wanna apologize. I'm not super familiar with who you are. I came to talk to him about religious stuff. Totally good. Do you, you wanna just give me a quick like overview of what your religious beliefs are so I can still involve You in this conversation cause yeah, I just feel like absolutely no, just nothing new for you. So absolutely I'm a Christian who believes that Jesus Christ uh, died on the cross for my sins. Uh, so there is, is hope for an eternal life. Where's the speaker? That's coming out of my heart. A hard, hard time hearing over the crowd but uh, can you just say the last half of that again? Uh, yes, absolutely. I said I'm a Christian who believes that Jesus Christ died on the cross for my sins and hopes for eternal life. Okay. Alright. Okay. Um, and then Charlie Kirk, I don't want to just explain your views, but from what I've got I've seen a pretty good deal of you. You're you know famous. Uh, I know that you do believe the the generally speaking the Bible is a good justification for morality good guide for morality. You do believe Jesus Christ you do believe that he was resurrected you do believe that he died for our sins. Anything else you need that you feel is important before I get into the conversation clarify? No, but I imagine you're probably gonna say something like, oh, does the Bible like endorse slavery or something like that? That's actually exactly what I was talking about. Yeah, because it you, you didn't guess anything you had a lady asking me what my belief was. Yeah, interestingly. So that's not actually what I was going to Ask it is about slavery. Let's focus on that. Does the Bible endorse slavery? Objectively? Yes, it does. What verse? So there's a lots of verses in the Bible. No, not correct. The Bible regulates slavery. I will first and ancient practice. What verse does the Bible ever endorse?

Uh, you know, things like red flag laws and things like that. You know, the age you just approved Mel Gibson to get his gun rights back even though he had a domestic violence charge. So, you know, I don't think the people that commit these violent crimes should be able to buy guns and things like that. And I think we should have red flag laws in place to make sure that those violent criminals aren't getting guns. Okay, so let's go. So tell me, in your perfect world, what would constitute a red flag? Uh, I mean, just things like, you know, we can look into any kind of medication, And things like that, they can affect someone's. That could be dangerous. Right? I mean, that could be. I mean, there's a lot of vets that come home from war and that are on a lot of medication. A lot of vets could have their weapons carried away. Well, I'm not necessarily saying, bless you. Bless you. Thank you. It's the pollen or something. Thank you. Haha. Um, I mean, I'm not necessarily saying like, it's. It's mainly to prevent, you know, future shootings and things like that. And also, uh, putting in place things like a federal registry so that we know, you know, the types of guns that people have. And, you know, it would just essentially be a federal registry that shows these are the guns that this person has. You know, in case a cop has to go on something like a domestic call, that's the most dangerous call they can go on. So. Yeah, I can see you're coming after this from a good perspective. Let me ask one other question. What do you. What would you say is the ultimate and final purpose of the Second Amendment? Uh, I think it's self defense against a tyrannical government. Which we agree. Sure. Great. Keep going. Well, but I think. I think within the Second Amendment, it also implies that we have high regulations. In the first four words, sort of well regulated. Militia actually meant well armed, but that's a separate issue. But Like, how do you know you're interpreting what the founding fathers? Well, they said it in the Federalist Papers. Right? So it's not just me, but also in the Heller decision, in the 5 4 decision that said that gun ownership was a right. This was a hotly debated thing, but see, do you disagree? Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. Do you. Do you, like, disagree with the idea of, like, a federal registry like that? Oh, without a doubt. The only reason you want to register the guns is if you want to confiscate them. Well, or to make sure that people, like officers of law, are protected and know what they're going into. I'm in a domestic. Again, that's a. That's a good argument, right? To your credit, I will try to make a better argument. Where the problem of the

However, my statement, slash question is, would you agree, slash, disagree that the Make America movement, make America great movement again? You know, MAGA movement is a cult? No. And, uh, why don't you explain to me and the audience what is a cult? Of course. Okay. Do you know any characteristics of a cult? Um, sure. I mean, you could take the Jonestown death cult, uh, of which there was a. I don't know, a. A.

Am I getting closer to, I mean, the Democrat Party according to the. No, no, what I'm talking about is MAGA. According to the Beuthan Cook University website, characteristics of a cult include isolating members and criticizing them for leaving. Would you say that members of the MAGA movement will criticize others for leaving? Well, yeah. I mean, but you guys criticize players that transfer out of the university of Tennessee football team. That's not a cult. Okay, what about the absolute authoritarianism without meaningful, um, accountability? Okay, so what you're trying to say is that, like, what the leader says, the leader gets? Basically, yes, Trump, we We have lots of disagreements in the MAGA movement. In fact, I'm more pro life than the president is. In fact, a lot of people in this audience would have differing views, maybe on where the president is at, on Israel or Gaza or Ukraine or Russia. In fact, some people in this audience might say the president is not as pro second Amendment as they would like. I would argue that we actually have far more intellectual diversity in the MAGA movement than your traditional Democrat Party. I see where you're going with this and sitting that not every person who, I guess, supports Trump is fully supportive of him. But I'm saying the MAGA movement, who would agree with him no matter what?

So my name is Robert Matas and I kind of wanna not make this like a screaming match. I first off do wanna say that although I don't believe in a lot of the stuff that you say, I do wanna give you your flowers for giving us people who do disagree the chance to come and talk about it. Thank you for saying that. Um, and to like, even for me, like someone who wants to get into politics, I have a chance now to challenge my beliefs in myself with someone who's like talk to Newsom and everything. So my main thing I wanna talk about, um, is the fact that, so you have said that you're a constitutionalist, right? Like, like you feel like you are a strong believer in the Constitution? Correct. Yeah. So my question is, or I guess my belief is that now with the modern day presidency, oh, sorry, you cannot be a constitutionalist and still support Trump. Okay. Why? And then I have a follow up question. So my first thing is 1, Trump openly defying the Supreme Court and supporting that is him saying on an interview just the other day he does not know if it's his job to uphold the Constitution, which in fact is one of the main jobs of the presidency, which I feel like, am I wrong? Can you combat that? I, I don't believe that's what he said, but let's talk. You can look at the interview. That's it. Literally what he said. He has lawyers to decide whether he has to. Yes. Correct. No, of course. When the DOJ, first of all, is not his attorneys. the DOJ actually 100% is. They are the US government. no, no. But who they do not protect Donald Trump. Stop interrupting. First of all, what branch is the department of justice in? I'm not. Okay. I'm sorry. I don't have that written down here. I'm just, dude, come on. I mean, but can you. It's in the exact, it's in the executive branch. So the DOJ. Respond to my claim though. Yes. Without you interrupt, I let you talk uninterrupted. You're true. You're true. The DOJ works for President Trump. Completely and totally. They are in the executive branch. The attorney general is holy adherent to the president of the United States. Secondly, tell me about Article 2. Well, they are also there to keep Trump in check. No, they're not. That's where you're wrong, dude. That's the third branch. That's what that that, no, see, this is where you're totally miseducated. The DOJ works for President Trump. Literally. The Attorney General United States works for the President United States. The Supreme Court or the third branch is a separate branch. The DOJ is not a separate branch. It's not. I'm not saying the DOJ is a separate branch. Yes. But I'm saying the DOJ should. I'm saying that they Are not meant to serve Trump. Yes, they are. If Trump does something wrong. No, that's wrong. That's not correct. You, you, you see, you have a wrong and you have to tell me what.

Yes, Dave? Did you take my money again? What do you mean? The money I've been saving for four years. Oh, don't be so grumpy. We needed it. What does that even mean? For your sister's wedding. What? Yes, we needed to impress her in laws. I spent four years collecting that money so that I can finally move out. And you think it's okay to take my money just like that? Yes, I have the right to. As your mother, I carried you in my stomach for nine months. After all that and raising you, this is how you're going to treat me? Excuse me, mom, I gave you at least 200 dollar every week. That's not enough. I've been working since the second I turned 16, okay? And I deserve to keep my own money. Oh, please. You really are spoiled. Just like Sarah said, huh? You don't even deserve that money. Your sister needs it more. Why can't she pay? She's literally 25. She's a salaried employee. No, she can't do that. He makes more than me. That doesn't matter. You're her brother. This isn't fair. Life's too short to worry about trivial things like money. This is my future, my college funds, my future rent, okay? Your sister's wedding is more important. I saved at least 15 K. Yes, and it was a great contribution to the wedding. I can't believe this. And does Sarah know you're spending my savings on her wedding? Well, of Course she knows. She's the one who suggested it. Get me my money back. No. Why? Why are you being so crazy? It's just money. If it's just money, then why don't you spend your own money? Actually, even better. Why doesn't Sarah spend her own money on her own wedding? No, son, that makes no sense whatsoever. I will ruin her wedding if I don't get my money back. You wouldn't. And you're still not getting the money back. Fine then. I didn't wanna have to do this. What could you possibly threaten me with this time? Not only will I ruin Sarah's wedding, I'll ruin your marriage too. What is this, some sort of joke? No. I can tell father that you're cheating on him. You don't even have proof. You're crazy. That's rich coming from someone who is sleeping with not only her boss, but her assistant as well. Like I said, you're crazy. And I even have pictures of not only the text messages, but of the two of you together. You wouldn't. Oh, yes, I would. You want your money back? Yes. Every penny. But I can't. You can and you will. But I already spent it on things for the wedding. We'll figure it out. I won't forgive you for this. Good. So now you know how it feels. I wish I never birthed a son as selfish as you are. Oh, and that reminds me. I also want my other 5 K that You previously took from me, so that makes it 20 K. What? How am I supposed to make that? Much the same way I did. By working my ass off. I can't believe you. Lol. That's what I said. This is no laughing matter. You have until the end of this month, mother, or it will all come crashing down. And a little piece of advice. Selling some of that jewelry might be a good idea.

Honey, about last night. You ordered filet Mignon, lobster, and the most expensive bottle on wine. I can't drop $800 every date. Don't be mad, but we need to budget. OMG, it's just $800. Don't be so cheap. What's going on? We used to have fun. Just Netflix and chill. Didn't need to spend much. Lol. Times change. Tiffany and Jade's boyfriends don't complain about $800. I know you've got savings. Maybe use some. Why are you being like this? I'm saving for something I can't tell you about yet. Is it for a new car? Cause yours is a piece of shit. No, not that. But I can't say. You'll find out when it's time. Whatever. Maybe I should date someone with a better job. We should break up. Seriously? We've been together eight years. Yeah, well, I can't keep dating someone this broke. Hold up. Have you been seeing other guys? You know what? Yeah. Because Jason actually takes me to nice places. I deserve that. Honey, I can't believe this. Are you serious? Stop texting me. We're done. Honey, please. Hello? Two months later. Hey. Wow. Didn't expect to hear from you. Um, what's up? I'm okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. I was watching Too much Instagram and my friends made me think I needed a boyfriend with more money. Too late, honey. I'm with someone else now. Used my savings for what I was planning. Not rich, but I'm actually very happy now. What were you saving for? Tell me. If you known, maybe you wouldn't have left.

Where did you hear that date? It was in the note with Dad's watch. The watch you said was destroyed. Emma, where are you right now? Still at Jessica's. Her mom's about to drive me home. Number? Go to Aunt Claire's instead. Don't come home. You're scaring me. What's going on with these texts from Dad's number? Someone is trying to manipulate you. Your father died in that accident last month. Then why is his watch here? Why does someone know about July 15th? Your father's former partner must have gotten access to his personal effects. What partner? You said dad worked alone. I needed to protect you from certain aspects of his work. There's another text. Ask about the offshore account in the Caymans. Don't respond to any more messages. They're trying to get information. Information about what? What was dad involved in? Your father was an accountant for some powerful people. He found discrepancies. Criminal discrepancies. Was dad in danger? We're in the car now. Jessica's mom is acting strange. She keeps checking her mirrors. Is she taking you to our house or to Claire's? Neither. We're heading toward the lakehouse where the text said to go. Emma, that's not Jessica's mother. The real Carol has a scar on her wrist. She's wearing long sleeves. I can't tell. Ask to use her phone. Say yours is dying. She refused. Said her battery is low, too. Try to get a look at her wrist. Find An excuse. I asked her to check the time. No scar. Mom, who is this woman? Listen carefully. When she slows down at the next intersection, unlock your door and run. She just locked all the doors from her control panel. Is there anything in the car you can use as a weapon? Jessica's field hockey stick is in the backseat. I'm 10 minutes from the lakehouse. Is she still heading there? Yes. She just got a call. She's speaking another language. Sounds Eastern European. Your father's files exposed an international money laundering operation. Dad was just an accountant. How did he get involved in this? He was recruited specifically because of his skills. He didn't know what they were hiding. She's pulling over at the convenience store. Says she needs cigarettes. This is your chance. Get out while she's inside. I can't. She took the keys and told me she'll be watching through the window. Check the glove compartment. Is there anything useful? There's a gun, mom. A real gun. Don't touch it. It could be a setup. She's coming back. She's talking to someone outside the car. Take a photo of them. Discreetly, if you can. Done. Sending it now. That's Andre Kozlov. He worked with your father's firm. We're driving again. They're taking me to the lakehouse. The watch, Emma, is there anything unusual about it? The back has a small SD card taped to it. I never noticed before. That's what they want. Your father must Have copied the evidence. Should I destroy it? No. It's the only leverage we have. It's evidence of their entire operation. We're at the lakehouse. There's a black SUV waiting. I'm two minutes away. Can you see who's in the SUV? It's Mister Peterson from Dad's office. The one who spoke at his funeral. He's the one who recruited your father. He's been leading this whole operation. She's making me get out of the car, stall, ask questions, keep them talking until I get there. Peterson says he just wants the watch and we'll be safe. He's lying. They can't leave witnesses. He's showing me a badge. FBI. Is that possible? Huh? Boost for part three.

Hey, my favorite girl, Tammy. What do you mean your brother has another girl over? Who is she? I don't know, but her and Justin are sitting on the couch together, giggling. Is this girl a family friend or something? No. Um, I think it's a girl from his math class. Her name is Aubrey. Emma, they just kissed. They did what? And please don't be mad at me. I don't want to hurt anyone or to make anyone mad. Please rizz up. How do I make Tammy smile? Tell Tammy Mommy this. How could I ever be mad at you? You're my little ray of sunshine. How could I ever be mad at you? You're my little ray of sunshine. Oh, that means so much to me. Me. And thank you. Don't worry, Tammy. I'm coming over right now. Don't tell your brother. Yay!

Emma, can you stop blowing up my phone right now? I'm busy. Busy doing what, Justin? I'm just watching Netflix. What show are you watching? Stranger Things. New season. Justin. What? What? You said you were going to wait and watch that season with me. Yeah, I know, but I got bored, babe. Justin, you said that It would be our little date. Me, you and stranger things. Are you watching it with another girl? No, babe, I would never. I'm just bored. Then turn it off and watch it with me. No, sorry, boredom got the best of me. We can watch something else later. Okay, we'll see about that. Huh? What does that mean? Tammy, what are Justin and Aubrey doing right now? They're still on the couch. Right now they're cuddled up watching Stranger Things. That little bitch. Huh? Nothing. Tammy, I'm here. Could you come open the door for me? Yay! I'm alright. I'm coming to the door with my Barbies. I'm going to need you to go to your room when I come in. We'll play later, okay? Um. Emma, did I do something wrong? Why are you and Justin arguing? I even saw you crying when you ran back to your car. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt anyone. Emma, please. I'm so sorry. It's okay, Tammy. You did nothing wrong. Emma, I'm so sorry. Maybe this is all my fault for being nosy. Tammy, it's okay. You did the right thing. Alright? Emma, um, could we play Barbies and dress up? Sorry, Emma, I can't come over to your house anymore. Wait, Emma, why? I'm sorry for making you and Justin argue. I didn't mean to do anything bad. Tammy, it's not you. It's just we can't be friends anymore. But why? Emma? I love you so much. You're like my best friend. Or like my big sister. I don't want to lose you. You make life so fun. I know, Tammy. I love you, too. You're like my little sister. It breaks my heart, but we have to let go, Emma. I don't wanna let go. Ever since my big sister passed away, I've been so alone. But then you came in my life to make me happy again. I don't want to lose another sister again, Tammy. I'm so, so sorry, Emma. What do you mean, Emma? Justin, how could you? A what? You know what you did to Emma? You broke her heart. Maybe if you would have kept your mouth quiet, you little snitch, everything would have been fine. Mom said Emma is in the hospital right now because of it. She's hurt because of this. I can't believe you. I lost my best friend because of you. Now me and mom are going to the hospital to make sure she's okay. Stop texting me, you little snitch! Justin, I swear, if I lose Emma, I will never forgive you. She was my big sis. You know how alone I've been after Jessica passed. Don't you dare bring up Jessica! Stop texting me, you little snitch! I do not care! You better pray she's okay.

I can't believe. Shoo! You paired me up with my ex, who cheated on me with the entire football team for the final physics project that could have saved my failing grade. All gaily did the entire time was flirt with me. Then today, when we were supposed to turn the project in, she sent me this. She fed the project to her freaking dog! How could you do this to me? Lucas, that is the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard. Just admit you were too lazy to do the project. Take your failing grade like a man. Your family will be so disappointed in you now you won't get your scholarship, and they'll have to come out of pocket. I promise I did the project. Bailey just ruined it because I didn't want to get back with her. I don't want to hear it, Lucas. You know what else Bailey told me, Miss Geisha? She said she paid you $300 to set us up as partners. An accusation like that is blasphemous. I would never take money from a student. It's just fate that you two were paired together. Two slackers in my class. Makes sense. You think I'm gullible, Miss Geisha? Bailey told me. I'm telling the principal this if you don't make this situation right. Tell Mr. Reynolds with what proof? All you have is a message from Bailey. I'll make this work. In my favor. Whatever. Just come back to class and take your failing grade. Oh, where are you, Lucas? I just walked into class, and you're not here. I miss seeing your cute face. Sit next to me, Bailey. You completely ruined my life. You're a selfish brat who destroyed our project because I didn't want to get back with you. I'll never be with a girl like you ever again. Oh, come on, Luki Puki. It's not that serious. You know what would be so romantic? Failing this class together because we both gave up on the project to fall in love. Stop with this. You destroyed the project and fed it to your dog, all because I didn't want to be with a bop like you. You're being dramatic. Can't Tina app bring me roast Master robot help me roast my bop X that keeps trying to get me back? Say, what man in their right mind would wife a garden tool? What man in their right mind would wife a garden tool? Wow. Lucas Shrieley, stop talking to me. I'm going to make sure you and Miss Geisha get what you deserve. Yeah, right. Have fun with that. Ha ha ha! I'll be sitting here waiting for you to come back, my king. Shut it! Mr. Reynolds, I need your help. What's going on, Lucas? Miss Geisha paired me up with my ex for the final physics project. I told her I didn't want to work with Bailey? Because she cheated on me with the entire football team. The whole football team? Dang. Yeah, but it gets worse. I needed this project to get a scholarship and take the load off my struggling family. Bailey flirted with me the entire time and distracted me from working. I did 90% of the project and dropped it off at her house to finish the rest. She fed it to her dog because I didn't want to be with her. Oh my god. How could she do something so vindictive? It gets even worse. She told me she paid Miss Geisha $300 to pair us together. Isn't that breaking some kind of school rule? That's definitely against school board guidelines. That is absolutely unacceptable behavior. But do you have any proof of this? Bailey sent me a message saying she gave Miss Geisha 300. That's not sufficient proof. Lucas, I'm sorry. There has to be something we can do. I'm sorry, but there's nothing concrete enough to act on. Wait. Check the cameras. Maybe there's something. Alright, but I doubt we'll find anything. Wait, I see something. What? Comment part three.

I was 12 when a man in a blue pickup truck pulled up next to me while I was walking home from school. He asked if I wanted to earn $20 helping him move boxes. My parents had always warned me about strangers, but $20 seems like a fortune to a kid who got $5 allowance. The the moment I got in his truck, I knew I'd made a terrible mistake. He immediately locked the doors and started driving in the opposite direction of where he said we were going. When I asked where we were headed, he told me to shut up and sit still. He drove for what felt like hours to a small cabin in the woods. No neighbours, no cell towers, nothing but trees. He dragged me inside and tied me to a chair in what looked like a basement. The smell was awful, like something had died down there. For the first two days, he barely spoke to me except to bring stale bread and warm water. I cried constantly, begging him to let me go home. He just stared at me with these cold, empty eyes and said my parents probably hadn't even noticed I was gone yet. On the third day, he made a mistake. He left his phone on the table while he went upstairs to make himself lunch. I could hear him moving around in the kitchen above me. Rope around my wrists, Had loosened slightly from struggling, and I managed to work one hand free. I grabbed his phone and called the first number I could think of, my mom's work number that she'd made me memorize for emergencies. When she answered, I whispered as quietly as I could, mom, I've been kidnapped in a cabin somewhere. There are tall pine trees everywhere, and I can hear a train in the distance. Before I could say more, I heard his footsteps coming down the stairs. I quickly put the phone back and got my hand back in the rope just as he appeared. He looked at me suspiciously, but didn't seem to notice anything different. What I didn't know was that my mom had immediately called the police while staying on the line. They traced the call and started searching for cabins near train tracks in our area. Meanwhile, she kept calling his phone every few minutes, hoping I'd answer the next morning. He seemed agitated, kept looking out the windows and pacing around the cabin. I realised later that police helicopters had been circling the area, getting closer to finding us. He started talking about moving me somewhere else, which terrified me. That afternoon, he went outside to load something into his truck. I heard him talking to someone on the phone, getting angry. While he was distracted, I noticed he'd left the basement door unlocked. This was my chance. I quietly climbed the stairs and saw him through the window. Still arguing on the phone by his truck. The front door was about 15 feet away. I knew I had to be smart about this. If I ran straight out, he'd see me immediately. Instead, I crawled on my hands and knees toward the back of the cabin. There was a small window near the floor that looks like it might be big enough for me to squeeze through. I managed to push it open and wiggle through, scraping my arms and legs on the frame. Once outside, I ran as fast as I could toward the sound of the train tracks. I figured if I could reach them, I might find help, or at least know which direction LED back to civilization. My legs felt like jelly from being tied up for days, but pure adrenaline kept me moving. After running for about 10 minutes, I heard dogs barking in the distance. Then I heard voices calling my name. It was the search and rescue team my mom had called in. I screamed as loud as I could and kept running toward the voices. A police officer

Watching. Okay. Maybe you've seen him. I see him every night. Me too. When do you sleep? A few hours between the sun comes up and school starts. You? I wear a face mask and keep all the lights on. But lately I haven't slept much. Me either. Do you think there are others like us? You're the only other person I know of. What does he want? Have you ever turned the lights off and pretend to be asleep? Yes. What does he do? I can hear him creeping toward me. Me too. He gets close and I can feel his breath. It's cold. Yes, but then I freak out and turn on the light. What if he wants to tell us something? What if he wants to kill us? I think we should work together. Maybe we can help each other. I've tried recording with my laptop. I can see him on the live feed, but he never shows up on the recording. How does that help us? I can hack into your laptop and watch you while you're sleeping. Who's creepier, you or him? Hear me out. I'll watch him while you sleep and see what he does. You can plug your lamp into a remote that I can access from the web. If he does anything dangerous, I'll turn on the light and he'll disappear. I don't know. You can do the same for me. Watch you? Yes. I can walk a through. That way we'll be like each other's guardian angels. We just have to sleep different times. I'm scared. I am too. But maybe we can figure out what he wants. Okay, I'm in. Hey. What's your name, kid? Good to meet you. Wake up. What happened? You can now check part two by pressing share. Then more.

Don't tell me you forgot what today is. Mom, not now, please. My girlfriend Anna is in labor. We're at the ER. Our baby is coming. So you did forget. I guess your little girlfriend made sure of that, huh? Of course she'd go into labor today on my birthday. What a coincidence. Are you serious right now? You think Anna planned this? She's going through it right now. The doctor said they don't know if she'll be okay. Oh, please. That girl has always had a flare for drama. She does this every stinking time. Every time I try to see you, something urgent comes up. I haven't seen my sweet boy in months. Mom, you really think she's faking this to make me miss your birthday? Are you actually that jealous of her? I see right through her. She's been trying to pull you away from me since the moment she met you. Last time you missed dinner because of period cramps. Oh, please. That girl will say anything to keep you from spending time with me. Are you out of your mind? Anna is about to risk everything, bringing in your grandchild, and you're going on some jealous rant? Don't yell at me. You wouldn't even be here if it weren't for me. I carried you. I raised you, and you're choosing her over your own mother on my 50th birthday? Because this is serious. Anna could lose it all, and you're crying about cake? And candles. That girl stole you. She made you cold. You used to call me every night. Now I have to beg to hear your voice. Do you know how that feels? I'm not a little boy anymore. I'm a father now. And you refuse to accept that. You changed the day you met her. You stopped coming over. You didn't show up for the family cookout. You said you were tired. But I know it was her. And now I spent weeks planning this birthday dinner. Everyone's here. Your uncle, your aunt, even grandma. And my son's seat is empty. Did you even freaking hear what I said? The doctor said Anna's fate is uncertain, and you're talking about a dinner? You were my baby first. All I wanted today was a hug from my son. One picture, one memory. You think your little family matters more than the one that raised you? That is the most selfish thing I've ever heard. You're evil. You want me to leave the woman I love? Well, she's fighting for everything. Just so you don't feel left out. Cantina. Ask. Bring Robert. Help me cook. My son for choosing his girlfriend over his own mother. Tell him.

I want the boy who made me laugh, the boy who asked me to braid his hair, who watched Disney movies with me on the couch. Now all I see is this bitter, distant man, and it's all because of her. Wow. You know what? I hope one day you realize how insane you sound. And until that day comes, I never want to talk to someone as selfish as you again. You don't mean that. Please tell me you don't mean that. Chris. Chrissy, baby, don't do this to your mama. Chrissy. You selfish, freaking brat! Do you even realize what you just did to your mother? Dad, not you, too.

I'm sorry, but I had to stand up for Anna. No, she's not fine. She. He's in the ER. What? What are you talking about? After you told her you never wanted to see her again. It hurt bad. I had to take her there. Oh, my god, dad, I didn't mean for that to happen. Don't give me that crap. You know your mother has. You knew what you were doing when you did that, and for what? Some freaking cake? Anna is in labor! They Don't know what will happen. I had no choice. There's always a choice. And you made yours. Don't call me dad anymore. It's Peter to you now. Dad, no.

I didn't even know he had a wife. So obviously, like, I'm, I understand that you've been married for three years, but I'm hurting also because I had no idea that he was married to you. And he's been acting like we are creating. Okay, but you know what I'm saying? Three months of casual dating is nothing compared to an actual marriage. Okay? I wasn't. Oh my goodness. Wait, wait, listen, I wasn't. Okay. Does he take off his wedding ring every time you see him? Yeah, he girl, he has never been wearing a wedding ring ever. Like never, ever. And I wasn't trying to be disrespectful of your marriage. I had no idea that he was married. Like, so that's what I'm saying. So obviously it's not been casual dating in my opinion and in my eyes, we have been building something together.

My wife's mom who lives 2.5 hours away in a neighboring state had some health issues. So my wife went there frequently. She got laid off from her job and basically went there and stayed for most of the summer. For the last part of the summer, our kids joined her. Then there was this on Facebook post. My wife was at a party and a friend tagged her and said something that implied that she was moving there and our kids would be going to the same school her friends kids went to. There were lots of pictures including her hanging all over this guy I recognized as her old boyfriend. Fortunately, I screen capped the post and pics before they got deleted. I started doing some digging and once I knew to look, the evidence was everywhere. Turns out my wife was having an affair with her high school boyfriend. She'd actually un enrolled our kids from their current school and enrolled them in a new school near her mom's for the fall. I talked to my best friend who pointed out that she might be angling to claim residency and I was likely headed for a nasty custody fight. So I bit my tongue, said nothing to her and hired a lawyer. I told my wife that my dad and I were taking the kids camping before the end of the summer. I had already told the kids who Were bored at grandma's and excited to go. She oddly objected but couldn't come up with a reason that we couldn't go. So we picked up the kids and went camping. While we were in the woods, she got served with divorce papers. What happened next was weird. I expected her to respond maybe a, what the hell? Or I'm coming home to see the kids, or let's talk this out or something.

My wife was at a party and a friend tagged her and said something that implied that she was moving there and our kids would be going to the same school her friends kids went to. There were lots of pictures, including her, hanging all over this guy I recognized as her old boyfriend. Fortunately, I screen capped the post and pics before they got deleted. I started doing some digging, and once I knew to look, the evidence was everywhere. Turns out my wife was having an affair with her high school boyfriend. She'd actually unenrolled our kids from their current school and enrolled them in a new school near her mom's for the fall. I talked to my best friend, who pointed out that she might be angling to claim residency and I was likely headed for a nasty custody fight. So I bit my tongue, said nothing to her, and hired a lawyer. I told my wife that my dad and I were taking the kids camping before the end of the summer. I had already told the kids who were Bored at Grandma's and excited to go. She oddly objected, but couldn't come up with a reason that we couldn't go. So we picked up the kids and went camping. While we were in the woods, she got served with divorce papers. What happened next was weird. I expected her to respond maybe a what the hell? Or I'm coming home to see the kids, or let's talk this out or something.

My wife, while on the toilet, had been scratched by the rat. She told me she felt fine and that she never noticed the scratch. When we got her tested, they said there was a high possibility to prepare for the rest. Apparently the chances of a rat or snake coming up your toilet isn't as impossible as you think. The rat had been coming up and down for days before anyone noticed. When my daughter saw it, she grabbed it and decided that it was gonna be her new pet. After a very long hospital trip, my wife was clear of rabies. We were so scared of using the toilet that for a week we used a litter box.

She said it felt like a hand was trying to touch her butt. She said specifically that she could feel a nail.

I put her back to bed and told her to let me know if anything was bothering her again. When I got back to bed, my wife had woken up from our talking and asked what had happened. I told her that our daughter had felt something reach for her in the toilet. My wife said that since we had bought an old house, it could be that our house was haunted, but I didn't believe that. When my wife was starting to fall back asleep, she said under her breath, that's weird because I felt something similar. After saying that, there was no way I could fall back asleep. What do you mean something or someone is touching my wife and daughter's behind? I went back to the bathroom. And started flushing the toilet. I flushed it over and over just in case of anything. I plunged it to make sure a piece of plastic wasn't stuck or anything. But after doing this for like an hour, nothing came up. I figured this must be one of those things that come with buying an old house. The next day, while I was prepping dinner with my wife, my daughter came up to me and said, daddy, can we get a new toilet? I asked her why and if she felt something again. She said, no, but it keeps.

An accusation like that is blasphemous. I would never take money from a student. It's just fate that you two were paired together. Two slackers in my class. Makes sense. You think I'm gullible, Miss Geisha? Bailey told me. I'm telling the principal this if you don't make this situation right. Tell Mr. Reynolds with what proof? All you have is a message from Bailey. I'll make this work. In my favor. Whatever. Just come back to class and take your failing grade. Oh, where are you, Lucas? I just walked into class, and you're not here. I miss seeing your cute face.

I did 90% of the project and dropped it off at her house to finish the rest. She fed it to her dog because I didn't want to be with her. Oh my god. How could she do something so vindictive? It gets even worse. She told me she paid Miss Geisha $300 to pair us together. Isn't that breaking some kind of school rule? That's definitely against school board guidelines. That is absolutely unacceptable behavior. But do you have any proof of this? Bailey sent me a message saying she gave Miss Geisha 300. That's not sufficient proof. Lucas, I'm sorry. There has to be something we can do. I'm sorry, but there's nothing concrete enough to act on. Wait. Check the cameras. Maybe there's something. Alright, but I doubt we'll find anything. Wait, I see something. What? Comment part three.

I was 12 when a man in a blue pickup truck pulled up next to me while I was walking home from school. He asked if I wanted to earn $20 helping him move boxes. My parents had always warned me about strangers, but $20 seems like a fortune to a kid who got $5 allowance. The moment I got in his truck, I knew I'd made a terrible mistake. He immediately locked the doors and started driving in the opposite direction of where he said we were going. When I asked where we were headed, he told me to shut up and sit still. He drove for what felt like hours to a small cabin in the woods. No neighbours, no cell towers, nothing but trees. He dragged me inside and tied me to a chair in what looked like a basement. The smell was awful, like something had died down there. For the first two days, he barely spoke to me except to bring stale bread and warm water. I cried constantly, begging him to let me go home. He just stared at me with these cold, empty eyes and said my parents probably hadn't even noticed I was gone yet. On the third day, he made a mistake. He left his phone on the table while he went upstairs to make himself lunch. I could hear him moving around in the kitchen above me. Rope around my wrists had Loosened slightly from struggling, and I managed to work one hand free. I grabbed his phone and called the first number I could think of, my mom's work number that she'd made me memorize for emergencies. When she answered, I whispered as quietly as I could, mom, I've been kidnapped in a cabin somewhere. There are tall pine trees everywhere, and I can hear a train in the distance. Before I could say more, I heard his footsteps coming down the stairs. I quickly put the phone back and got my hand back in the rope just as he appeared. He looked at me suspiciously, but didn't seem to notice anything different. What I didn't know was that my mom had immediately called the police while staying on the line. They traced the call and started searching for cabins near train tracks in our area. Meanwhile, she kept calling his phone every few minutes, hoping I'd answer the next morning. He seemed agitated, kept looking out the windows and pacing around the cabin. I realised later that police helicopters had been circling the area, getting closer to finding us. He started talking about moving me somewhere else, which terrified me. That afternoon, he went outside to load something into his truck. I heard him talking to someone on the phone, getting angry. While he was distracted, I noticed he'd left the basement door unlocked. This was my chance. I quietly climbed the stairs and saw him through the window. Still Arguing on the phone by his truck, the front door was about 15 feet away. I knew I had to be smart about this. If I ran straight out, he'd see me immediately. Instead, I crawled on my hands and knees toward the back of the cabin. There was a small window near the floor that looks like it might be big enough for me to squeeze through. I managed to push it open and wiggle through, scraping my arms and legs on the frame. Once outside, I ran as fast as I could toward the sound of the train tracks. I figured if I could reach them, I might find help, or at least know which direction LED back to civilization. My legs felt like jelly from being tied up for days, but pure adrenaline kept me moving. After running for about 10 minutes, I heard dogs barking in the distance. Then I heard voices calling my name. It was the search and rescue team my mom had called in. I screamed as loud as I could and kept running toward the voices. A police officer

You've made me feel like I'll forever be nothing. Like I'll never matter. And honestly, maybe I won't ever matter. I've spent so much time adjusting to what you need me to be, what you expected of me. I stopped even caring if I liked myself. And I don't. I hate myself.

I'm sorry. I know I should have said it sooner. Yeah, you're right. You should have. And it's too late for sorry.

She's going through it right now. The doctor said they don't know if she'll be okay. Oh, please. That girl has always had a flare for drama. She does this every stinking time. Every time I try to see you, something urgent comes up. I haven't seen my sweet boy in months. Mom, you really think she's faking this to make me miss your birthday?

You know what? I hope one day you realize how insane you sound. And until that day comes, I never want to talk to someone as selfish as you again. You don't mean that.

Oh, my god. I was just about to do the same thing. Our phones were switched. I know. I hate this stupid school. They are the only ones who take our phones for assemblies. It's so annoying. Anyways, when can we meet? Uh, about that. What? My family and I were going on a road trip right after school, and we already left. We are an hour away, and trust me, I can't make them mad by asking to go back. You're lying. What the hell am I going to do with your phone for however long you are gone? I'm gone for the weekend. What? I can't wait three days. I have things to do. You know, sorry, Adam, but I don't know what to say. You're going to have to wait. Wait. How do you know who I am? Oh, uh, yeah, you know, I heard of you, at least. But how did you know it was my phone? When you texted me, I clicked on the notification and it showed your messages. Your last text was from your mom. So we are going through each other's messages now? No, no, it wasn't like that. I didn't mean to. Ha ha. I know. I'm just playing with you. So who am I speaking to then? You don't know me. Let's just keep it that way. Oh, come on. That's no fun. What's your name? Lily. Lily Smith. Yeah, you know me? Well, you know, heard of you. At least. Ah, you got me there. Yeah. Ha ha. So are we really doing this? Three days with each other's phones? There's no other choice. Unless you wanna drive six hours to meet us at our first stop, be my guest. Yeah, I don't know about all that. Anyways, let's make this interesting. How about we both can choose one app that's off limits? Alright, what app are you gonna choose? I choose notes. Notes? What the hell you got going on in there? Nothing. I chose it so now you can't see it. Okay then I'm going to do Snapchat. I wonder why. Oh stop it. Are you trying to call me a fuck boy? Ha ha. Maybe. At least get to know me. Just because I play football does not mean I'm one of them. I guess we will have to wait and see. Oh shoot, my dad just told me cell service is about to go out. We are in the middle of nowhere. I'll text you in a bit. Alright, see you soon Lily. Gosh, that was long. Thankfully you had games on your phone. Oh yeah, glad I could help. Haha, those come in handy sometimes. Hey, I have a question. Are you still dating Emma? Emma? How do you know about her? Everyone was talking about you guys and how great of a couple you were. Oh, well thankfully that's no longer. Thankfully? Yeah, she cheated on me. Oh my god, I'm so Sorry. No, no, don't be. I'm glad it happened. Why? Rizz app. What should I say? Because now I got my eyes on finding someone better. Because now I got my eyes on finding someone better. Oh. Anyone in mind? Uh, I don't know. I guess you could say I have a little crush. Really? Who? Ha, ha. You aren't gonna find out that easy. Oh, my god, you are really going to make me wait. Well, you are making me wait 3 days for my phone, so I think you can wait as well. Okay, maybe you're right. Ha, ha. It's getting kind of late. I think I'm gonna head to bed. Okay. Good night, Adam. Good night, Lily. Good morning, Lily. I hope you slept well. If you count sleeping in the back of a van sleeping well, then I guess you could say I did. Oh, yeah. Ha, ha. I forgot about that. Hey, I have a question. Go for it. What's in your notes that is so important? Oh, my god, stop. You can't look. I won't, but I'm curious now. Ha ha. Well, how about this? At the end of the trip, you can open my notes app on one condition. Which is? You tell me who your crush is. Oh, I think I could work with that. Yay! So where did you guys road trip to? We just got to Baltimore. No way. I have family there. Could they meet you and get my Phone. Oh, I mean, we are just about to leave now. I don't think we can. Haha, I'm just messing with you. I don't have family there. Oh my god, you scared me for a second. I'm guessing you're not actually leaving. Just wanted to keep talking. Well, I guess you could say you were right. Haha, I knew it. I'm actually sort of glad this all happened. Me too. You're really fun to talk to. Oh, thanks. I think I'm gonna go play some basketball. Okay. Have fun. Who said I was going? How are you gonna play while texting me? That's why Facetime was invented. Facetime? Uh, I don't know about that. Why not? I don't look good right now. Oh stop it. I see you every day and you look amazing all the time. Now is no different. Do you really think that? Of course. OMG, you're so sweet. Ha ha. I tried. Now pick up. Alright. Well that was fun, wasn't it? Yeah, you could say that. I didn't know you were that good at basketball. You play football? Ha ha. Well, what can I say? An athlete is an athlete. I'm gonna shower and get ready for bed now, Adam. Okay. I'll have you know though, tomorrow is the big day. Yeah. Ha ha. See you then. Good morning, Adam. Wakey Wakey, I'm awake. Your message notification can wake up my whole house, let alone just me. Haha yeah, it is a pretty loud one. So can I go on the notes app yet? Not just yet. Have some patience. You can do it when I'm an hour away from home. And how long is that gonna be? Well, for starters, I'm 6 hours out. Oh, my god. So long. For what? This better be good. Hopefully you like it. Me? Why would I like it? Oh, I don't know. I mean, just like after the wait. I hope you like it. I see. Well, I never thought I would be texting myself, but I will say this has been pretty fun. Same to you, Adam. Yeah, I was going to complain to the school about getting our phones mixed up, but I guess I'll cut them a break this time. Ha ha. This time. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. If it's with you, I wouldn't mind. Oh, okay, Adam, we are going back to a no service area. I'll text you when I'm close. Okay. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

But I put on the most excited face I could manage and told Linda it was absolutely perfect. You're so right, I said. This is what true elegance looks like. Would it be possible for me to borrow it? Linda literally started crying happy tears. She called all her friends to tell them her daughter in law was wearing her dress. He posted about it on Facebook with the caption, finally a girl with taste. The whole family thought it was so sweet that I wanted to honor Linda's legacy. But here's where it gets good. The morning of the wedding, I had both dresses at the venue. Linda's monstrosity was hanging in the bridal suite where she could see it. My actual dress was hidden in my maid of honor's car. I put on Linda's dress for all the getting ready photos, letting her fuss over me and fix the sleeves. About an hour before the ceremony, I told Linda I needed a moment alone to center myself before walking down the aisle. As soon as she left, Emma rushed in with my real dress. We had exactly 20 minutes to completely change my look. My makeup artist touched up my lipstick. My hair stylist adjusted a few curls and I slipped into the dress that actually made me feel beautiful. Linda was standing at the Back of the church when the music started, I watched her face go from pride to confusion to absolute horror as I walked down the aisle in my off shoulder mermaid dress. Kevin's jaw dropped in the best way. The photographer captured every second, including Linda's face, going through all five stages of grief in real time. After the ceremony, Linda cornered me by the cake table. What happened to my dress? She pissed. I smiled sweetly and said, oh, I decided you were right. I should wear something that makes me feel confident and beautiful, not desperate. Thanks for the advice. She tried to cause a scene, but Kevin shut it down immediately. Turns out seeing his mom call me desperate and then watching me handle her manipulation made him realize how toxic she'd been. I told her if she couldn't respect his wife, she could leave early. The best part, during the reception, Linda's sister Margaret came up to me and whispered, I've been waiting 30 years for someone to put Linda in her place. That dress looks absolutely stunning on you, dear. Linda barely spoke to us for months after the wedding.

She kept showing me pictures on her phone of this puffy Princess Diana style dress with huge sleeves and enough fabric to make a tent.

She recently brought herself the top of the line back. My stepdaughter is jealous of her sister and have been very vocal about it. While we were bed last night. My wife said it was unfair one is making so much more than the other. I answered that there's nothing we can do about it and it's a good life lesson for the girls. My wife then suggested we have my daughter use her money to help my stepdaughter buy the same things or we cover the pay difference between the girls. I laughed because I thought she was joking, but she wasn't. We whispered for about an hour before we went to sleep. This morning she brought it up again and the accused said I'm refusing because I'm playing favorites and that's an aw move for a parent. We argued until we had to leave for work. Update thanks for reading my post and giving me your input. I've read through most of the replies during my lunch and I'll get through the rest after work. I'll answer some common questions. We tried to sign my stepdaughter up for the same sports as my daughter because we thought it would be a bonding experience. We also wanted to get her out of the house and meet people because she spends most of her time in her room playing world of Warcraft. We didn't make her participate, but asked that she Try things for at least a couple of weeks, then she could quit if she wanted to. We tried to get her to sign up for things that she enjoys, but she always refuses. Before getting this job, she spent much of her free time playing games, so I'm at a loss to think of any marketable skills she could leverage into tutoring.

So there I was trying on my dream wedding dress at the bridal shop with my fiance Kevin and his mom, Linda. The dress was this gorgeous off shoulder, mermaid style that made me feel like a princess. I was spinning around in front of the mirror, totally in love with how it looked, when Linda just rolled her eyes and said, don't you think that's a bit desperate looking? You're trying too hard to be sexy on your wedding day. I felt my heart sink. Kevin just stood there saying nothing, which made it worse. The sales lady looked uncomfortable and pretended to check her phone. Linda kept going, I mean, at your age, maybe something more conservative would be better. More classy, less attention seeking. That night at dinner, she wouldn't stop talking about how her own wedding dress from 1987 was timeless elegance. She kept showing me pictures on her phone of this puffy Princess Diana style dress with huge sleeves and enough fabric to make a tent. This is what a real bride looks like, she said. Not like these modern girls showing off everything. Kevin finally spoke up and told her to stop, but the damage was done. I spent the whole week second guessing my dress choice. Maybe she was right. Maybe I did look desperate. I even went back to the shop to try On more conservative options, but nothing felt right. Then my sister Emma came over and found me crying in my bedroom surrounded by wedding magazines. When I told her what happened, she got this evil grin on her face. Wait, didn't Linda say she kept her wedding dress in perfect condition in her closet? The one she's so proud of? That's when Emma hatched the most brilliant plan ever. She called Linda and told her I was having second thoughts about my dress and wanted to see hers for inspiration. Linda was so excited, she practically ran over with the dress bag, going on about how she always hoped one of her daughters in law would appreciate real fashion. The dress was exactly as hideous as I remember.

Our principal announced a surprise assembly, saying a famous Youtuber would film with us. Everyone rushed to the gym excited, posting stories. But when we arrived, F B I. Agents were checking phones and confiscating them. They said it was for the celebrity's privacy, so nobody questioned it. Then they locked every exit. After an hour, trapped inside, people started panicking. Some girl tried calling 9 1 1, but there was no signal. They'd installed jammers. Teachers looked terrified, but wouldn't speak. Agents kept pulling kids wearing red hoodies for questioning. One kid fainted from anxiety, and they wouldn't even let the nurse properly help him. Then this scene. You're tried climbing out a window. Three agents literally tackled him and zip tied his hands. His girlfriend started screaming, and they removed her, too. Parents were apparently rioting outside, but we couldn't hear anything. Four hours in, kids were crying, and someone started live streaming on an old iPod that still worked. It instantly went viral. Students held hostage, trending everywhere. News helicopters appeared overhead. Finally, our principal grabbed the mic, shaking, and explained everything. That morning, someone had posted a TikTok from our bathroom, saying, gonna make this place famous tomorrow. But here's the insane part. It was just a kid announcing he'd finally attempt the legendary thousand paper towel flush challenge that would flood the entire wing. The FBI had interpreted the bomb as a threat. The Red Hoodies. The kid wore one in his profile pic. The entire lockdown, the panic, the arrests, all because someone didn't understand Gen Z humour. The kid got expelled anyway, but his TikTok explaining everything got 50 million views. Now our school's Wikipedia page has a whole section called The Emoji Incident.

Take a long pee, try to get my head together and head back to our bedroom. He is still peeing. Not only is he still peeing, but he has now started to systematically pee on all of the things I love and need. He's peeing in my shoes. He's peeing in my drawers. He's swerving all the things of his and peeing on everything of mine. To add insult to injury, he's now peeing all over my blankets. I wasn't exactly quiet throughout this ordeal. I was enraged. Obscenities flew forth from my mouth and the hate flowed through me. He responded with things of the same nature. And the worst one was when he would calmly say, stop yelling, while he was peeing on my stuff. I have no earthly idea how he contained so much urine, but it was unbelievable. It finally stops, but now everything I love is wet. I'm cold. I don't even have A blanket. The tile floors are puddled everywhere. The screaming continues and the cops are called. I answer the door red eyed with hot rage, tears coming down my face. I told the officer everything was fine and it still amazes me they said okay and left. I find the one thing that was left relatively unscaved by his urine, a white sheet and I pathetically wrap myself in it and curl up on the couch in our room waiting, revelling for the moment he is actually conscious. The moment arrives when he gets off the bed wrapped in my wet blanket. He crawls up to me and with the most sorry, almost teary I look on his face and the most pathetic tone.

What I remember. Woke up feeling horrible in bed at my sister's house. Remembered nothing. Smell of urine everywhere. Body covered in tiny puncture wounds. My junk hurts. Turned to look at my girlfriend who was huddled on a couch shivering really hard. She's staring right at me. Try to start with a good morning, love you, and she immediately interrupts me. Fu. How did this happen? Well, I don't remember, so I'll hand the keyboard over to my now wife. It all started with beer and my husband's annoyingly violent but charming friend. The taste of this beer was so appallingly bad that they had to pour salt in it to even make it palatable. It was awful, but it was extremely cheap. So the beer is cheap, and let's call his friend goofy. So after about eight beers each, goofy decides that the most hilarious and fun thing to do at about this time is to grab a staple gun and start playing what I can only describe as the worst game of tag ever. I try to stop them. I try to convince my then boyfriend that this is going to lead to infections. Please stop going for his spine, goofy. And not the face! Not the face! But no, they are having far too much fun. Goofy still has a scar on the middle of his forehead from that night. Every 10 seconds I Hear that sickening crack sound coming from the staple gun and another outburst of F! Hahaha! And by now the taste of the beer isn't slowing them down anymore because they are too intoxicated to notice the taste. They managed to go through the entire rack themselves. As I pathetically try and finish my drink in an effort to calm my nerves about these two idiots now standing leg with apart, taking turns straight up kicking each other in the junk as hard as they can, laughing. I winces as I watch all future hope for children go out the window. There is no stopping them. I can't watch it anymore. Things continue to get more violent and stupid and I decide I'm going to call it a night and let the chips fall where they may. It's all too stressful. My dreams consist of heavy rain storms. The sound of a hard rain hitting the pavement outside. Eventually I awake to this persistent sound, only to realize.

In the far corner of our yard, my three children were sitting in a perfect circle. Around them were flickering candles, my expensive aromatherapy candles I've been saving. Between them was our family photo album pages arranged in some strange pattern on the grass. They were completely silent, heads bowed, holding hands tightly. They'd drawn something in the dirt with a stick. What are you doing out here? I gasped, my voice cracking between relief and horror. My eight year old looked up, expression deadly serious in the candlelight. We're summoning Grandma's spirit to ask if you're dead or just sleeping really hard. What? I sputtered, genuinely wondering if I was still asleep and dreaming. My 6 year old nodded solemnly. You've been asleep for 9 hours, mom. We tried everything to wake you up.

We tried calling dad, but he didn't answer. So we found your spell book. My what? I interrupted. He pointed to my leather journal where I occasionally wrote poetry. Your spell book with all the weird words and rhyming magic spells. We found it in your nightstand drawer. We thought grandma could tell us how to bring you back. I just stood there barefoot in wet grass, watching my children earnestly performing a seance because they thought I had died in my sleep. Now I don't nap ever because apparently in my household, a sleeping mother doesn't mean she's tired. It means time to summon the spirits of our ancestors for an emergency consultation.

What I remember. Woke up feeling horrible in bed at my sister's house. Remembered nothing. Smell of urine everywhere. Body covered in tiny puncture wounds. My junk hurts. Turned to look at my girlfriend who was huddled on a couch shivering really hard. She's staring right at me. Try to start with a good morning, love you, and she immediately interrupts me. Fu. How did this happen? Well, I don't remember, so I'll hand the keyboard over to my now wife. It all started with beer and my husband's annoyingly violent but charming friend. The taste of this beer was so appallingly bad that they had to pour salt in it to even make it palatable. It was awful, but it was extremely cheap. So the beer is cheap, and let's call his friend goofy. So after about eight beers each, goofy decides that the most hilarious and fun thing to do at about this time is to grab a staple gun and start playing what I can only describe as the worst game of tag ever. I try to stop them. I try to convince my then boyfriend that this is going to lead to infections. Please stop going for his spine, goofy. And not the face! Not the face! But no, they are having far too much fun. Goofy still has a scar on the middle of his forehead from that night. Every 10 seconds I Hear that sickening crack sound coming from the staple gun and another outburst of F! Hahaha! And by now the taste of the beer isn't slowing them down anymore because they are too intoxicated to notice the taste. They managed to go through the entire rack themselves. As I pathetically try and finish my drink in an effort to calm my nerves about these two idiots now standing leg with apart, taking turns straight up kicking each other in the junk as hard as they can, laughing. I winces as I watch all future hope for children go out the window. There is no stopping them. I can't watch it anymore. Things continue to get more violent and stupid and I decide I'm going to call it a night and let the chips fall where they may. It's all too stressful. My dreams consist of heavy rain storms. The sound of a hard rain hitting the pavement outside. Eventually I awake to this persistent sound, only to realize.

I freak out. I try to wake him. Stop peeing! Stop peeing! You are going to pee on the bed! Stop! He turns around and looks me dead in the eye, holds up his middle finger and says, Fu, Bitch! I am shocked and enraged. I can't even say anything. I decide the best course of action is to go to the bathroom and calm down. He will pass out again. I will slap him silly for this later, take a long pee, try to get my head together, and head back to our bedroom. He is still peeing. Not only is he still peeing, but he has now started to systematically pee on all of the things I love and need. He's peeing in my shoes. He's peeing in my drawers. He's swerving all the things of his and peeing on everything of mine. To add insult to injury, he's now peeing all over my blankets. I wasn't exactly quiet throughout this ordeal. I was enraged. Obscenities flew forth from my mouth and the hate flowed through me. He responded with things of the same nature. And the worst one was when he would calmly say, stop yelling while he was peeing on my stuff. I have no earthly idea how he contained so much urine, but it was unbelievable. It finally stops, but now everything I love is wet. I'm cold. I don't even have a Blanket. The tile floors are puddled everywhere. The screaming continues and the cops are called. I answer the door, red eyed with hot rage, tears coming down my face. I told the officer everything was fine and it still amazes me they said okay and left. I find the one thing that was left relatively unscathed by his urine, a white sheet, and I pathetically wrap myself in it and curl up on the couch in our room, waiting, revelling, for the moment he is actually conscious. The moment arrives when he gets off the bed, wrapped in my wet blanket. He crawls up to me and with the most sorry, almost teary, I look on his face and the most pathetic tone. I have this awful feeling about last night. I feel like I did something wrong.

Definitely can't afford to split a two hundred dollar check. L looks uncomfortable. I mean, I can put it on my card, Jessica says hesitantly. But, like, I'll get everyone back. Kate insists. You know I'm good for it. Except she's not. She still owes me money from our last three dinners together. That's when I reach into my jacket pocket. You mean this wallet? I place her black leather wallet right in the center of the table. The entire table goes silent. Kate's face drains of colour. How did you? She starts. Your nightstand, I say calmly. Same place you always forget it when we're going somewhere expensive. Jessica's mouth falls open. Mike actually laughs. Elle just stares back and forth between us. Kate reaches for the wallet like it might bite her. I can't believe you went through my stuff. I didn't go through anything. It was sitting right there in plain sight. Right next to the keys you somehow remembered to bring. She opens the wallet and I can see it's full. Credit cards, cash, everything she needs. So I continue. Are you paying for the birthday dinner you invited everyone to, or should I put this back in my pocket? Kate pulls out her credit card and hands it to our Waiter without saying a word after he walks away, Jessica breaks the tension. Kate that's kind of messed up. I just forgot. Kate protests weekly you forget a lot. Mike adds like. Like every time we go out. The rest of dinner is awkward, but at least everyone got to eat without worrying about the Bill. She hasn't forgotten her wallet since. Funny how memory improves when there are witnesses around.

This zip tied plastic bag is how I received grams. And that experience was awkward and uncomfortable. And every year, millions of Americans have poor experiences with ashes and earns just like I did. And so my company, Parting Stone, invented a new form of human and animal remains. Parting stone service returns the remains a form that resembles a collection of smooth stones. The appearance of each collection of stones varies naturally from person to person, returning different hues and textures and colors for each individual. Now families tell us about how they were able to hold their loved ones again and spread the stones in meaningful places. Sharks in front of you, there is a box containing one stone. Who's in the box? Um, these are the remains of my grandfather, who. This tape has no adhesive, so it sticks to nothing. But it's now and it is super duper strong. Take it, Lori. Hold it, hold it. Thank you. Okay, stop the madness. There's more madness. It leaves no sticky residue? No, it's reusable. If this was any other kind of tape, it would be history. But it's amazing tape, and it goes right back to the way that it was. So you have to tell us first off, who created it. Our father created this. And our father passed away this year. This is not really a business. I'm Out. This is perfect for one of the sharks here. Well, I have to. Not me. Not me. I'm out. This is the kind of thing that Barbara loves to get her hands into. Enough. Mark and I have been talking. We have an offer to make you. What we would like to do is buy the entire company for the hundred thousand dollars. And we'll take care of Hugo Legacy. This is really happening right now? We have to think about it. Oh, she's kidding. Thank you so much. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Look through there. You see the shark there? I do. Now put your hand down here and grab the paper. And then basically you see reflected. You see like your ghost hand. Oh, I see, I see. So it doesn't do the drawing for you, that's for you. It requires practice and patience, but it helps you get results quickly and actually helps you learn over time. Very interesting. Who knew? And you're saying this has been around for centuries? The historical tool that it's based on is the camera Lucida, which is first patented in like 18:07. I mean, it's been centuries that. That artists have used these sorts of devices. I can't see what he's doing. I'm just tracing around the shark. Observe, Lauren, how easy that was. Isn't that amazing? Thank you. That is absolutely spectacular. Why don't you burn those? Why are you selling t shirts? You can't make any money. Doing that I might. Your ask is 212,000 for 10%, correct? Yes. Why wasn't it 200 or 2 25 2. Oh, do I know the real answer to that question? Yeah. No. You lied to me. No. It's because I couldn't say 200 without stuttering. So I had to find a number that I could say without stuttering. Cause once I stuttered, the whole thing I'm gonna forget. So that's kind of why you're an honest guy, man. That I don't lie. I'm sorry.

Just as I lost myself in the story, strange noises started coming from outside my room. I went to check but found nothing there. The experience left me completely spooked, so I quickly tried calling my boyfriend. But then something unimaginable happened. A monster burst into my room. Luckily, I woke up at the very last moment. Whole terrifying experience had been just a nightmare. I immediately put down the novel, but my curiosity soon got the better of me. Before long, I was reading it again. Soon after, someone knocked at the door. Hearing my boyfriend Tommy's voice, I relaxed and let him in. When Tommy Learned about my nightmare, he begged me to stop reading horror stories and find another hobby. But I didn't listen. Instead, I started telling him all about the novels terrifying plot. The next night, I was reading Alone Again when another nightmare struck. Hearing the door open, I grabbed my self defense weapon and nearly struck Tommy as he returned from work. Furious, he made me promise to stop reading horror novels. But as soon as he fell asleep, I quietly returned to my book. The next day, something truly terrifying happened. On my way to work, I spotted the killer from the novel. But when I looked again, he had vanished. Then in the morning paper, I saw that characters who died in the novel Were mysteriously dying in real life. Panicked, I rushed to the police station, but the officers didn't take me serious. Just as I was taking the elevator to leave, the lights flickered and the terrifying scene from my nightmares began unfolding before my eyes.

But because she was afraid of injections, she asked the doctor to use carbon monoxide for anesthesia. However, once Emily passed out, the doctor made up an excuse to send the nurse away. As he prepared for the procedure, Emily's hand accidentally brushed against her thigh. Instantly, Noah's hypochondria kicked in, thinking Emily was hitting on him. Looking at her sexy body, Noah couldn't help but check her teeth with his hands. Seeing how cooperative she was, Noah excitedly leaned down to kiss her and began to remove her stockings. But then Noah's expression suddenly became hideous. He put his hands around Emily's neck just as she was about to be suffocated. Noah finally came to his sense and Emily came out of her coma. She came to the door in horror, collapsed into her boyfriend's arms. Confronted by Emily's boyfriend, Noah explains that what just happened? It's all carbon monoxide hallucinations. Just yesterday, Noah was a very good dentist, although having a serious obsession with cleanliness, but is highly respected. But this morning, as he was heading to work, he realized he forgotten something at home. When he returned, he discovered his wife cheating with a filthy janitor. Watching the janitor's dirty hands touching his wife, Noah completely broke down. So there was a problem with his mental state. At this time, the wife had no idea. A crisis is approaching.

She was on the verge of being promoted to platoon leader when a comrade reported her for failing to meet the academic requirements. As a result, she was dismissed from the military. When she returned home, she made up her mind to get into college. So she went to register at the school the very next day. Having served in the military for years, her hair had long been cut short, so the security guard mistook her for a man and stopped her right away. It took the girl 10 minutes of explanation finally get the security guard to let her enter the girl's dormitory. Upon arriving at her dorm room, the roommates, startled by the sudden male intruder, panicked. One of them even fell off the bed in fright. Fortunately, the girl caught her in time. The girl had thought her college life would go smoothly, but the next day during military training, she was shocked to find that the instructor was the very comrade who had reported her. This stirred up her emotions once again. Noticing this, the instructor began to take special care of her class. All training tasks were in.

So there's this kid at school named Ben who thinks he's some kind of tech genius. He's always bragging about how he can hack into anything and showing off with his fancy coding skills. Most people just ignore him, but he made the mistake of targeting me last month. I was sitting in the library working on an essay when Ben comes over and starts looking at my laptop screen. I had Spotify open in another tab because I was listening to music while I worked. Starts laughing and says my playlist is trash and asks if he can show me some real music. I said no thanks and went back to my work. But Ben doesn't take no for an answer. He pulls out his phone and starts typing away. And suddenly my Spotify starts skipping songs. Then it switches to some death metal band I've never heard of. I look at him and he's got this smug grin on his face. He whispers that he's connected to my account and can control it from his phone. Then he starts blasting the volume up and down just to mess with me. The librarian comes over and tells me to keep it down, which was embarrassing because everyone was staring. I told Ben to stop, but he just kept going. He changed my playlist name to something stupid and started adding weird songs to it when I tried to change it back on my laptop. He would just override it from his phone. It was like playing tug of war with my own account. The worst part was when he started following random people on my account and liking their playlists. Some of them were really inappropriate ones with explicit names. I was mortified because all my friends could see this stuff in their activity feed. After about 20 minutes of this torture, I finally had enough. I grabbed my stuff and left the library. But even at home, he was still messing with my account. Songs would randomly start playing in the middle of the night or my playlists would get deleted and recreated with terrible music. This went on for three days. Ben would walk past me in the hallway and smirk, knowing he had complete control over my Spotify. He even changed my profile picture to some meme of a crying baby. I tried changing my password, but somehow he still had access. That's when I came up with my plan. I did some research and found out that Spotify has a feature where you can report unauthorized access to your account. But I wanted to do more than just get him kicked off. I started documenting everything. I took screenshots of him changing my playlists, recorded videos of songs suddenly switching while I was using the app, and even got my friend to witness him controlling my music from across the classroom. Then I found out something interesting. Ben had been Bragging to other people about hacking not just my account, but several other students accounts too. He thought it was hilarious that he could mess with people's music and make them look stupid. So I reached out to those other kids and found out they had the same experience. Random music playing at inappropriate times, embarrassing songs showing up in their recent activity playlists, getting messed with. Some of them had even gotten in trouble with their parents when explicit songs started playing through their home speakers. We all decided to report this together. But instead of just going to Spotify, we went to the school administration first. Turns out what Ben was doing counts as cyberbullying and harassment. And our school has a zero tolerance policy for that kind of stuff. The school called his parents and mine for a meeting. When they showed all the evidence we had collected, Ben's face went.

So I snapped. What I discovered when I got there made me realize I'd raised a monster and I had to choose between my son and doing what was right. When my daughter in law, Emma called asking me to visit, I could hear something was wrong. She just had the baby three weeks ago, but her voice sounded hollow, defeated. I just, I need help, she whispered into the phone. But don't tell Kevin I called you. Red flag No. 1. Why couldn't she tell my son she needed support? I drove the four hours to their house. Immediately Kevin answered the door looking well rested, freshly showered, wearing clean clothes. Mom, what are you doing here? Emma called, I said, pushing past him. Where is she? I found Emma in the nursery, still in the same pajamas she'd probably worn for days. The baby was screaming. Emma was crying. The house was a disaster. Honey, when's the last time you slept, I asked. I don't know, she said, bouncing the baby mechanically. Tuesday, what day is it now? It was Friday. Kevin walked in, eating a sandwich. She's been a little emotional lately, he said casually. Hormones, you know? I looked at my son, my son who I'd raised to respect women and felt sick. When's the last time you held your daughter, I asked him. I held her yesterday, he said defensively, for like 20 minutes while Emma showered. 20? Minutes in a week. Your wife just had major surgery. She needs help. I work all day, he said. I'm tired, too. Emma was back at work. No, turns out Kevin meant his part time job at his buddies auto shop. Three days a week, four hours each. Meanwhile, Emma was up every two hours feeding the baby, doing all the night wakeings, plus somehow managing to keep the house from completely falling apart. I told her she could sleep when the baby sleeps, Kevin said, like he'd solve the problem, but she always finds something to clean instead. I watched Emma flinch at this like she was afraid to rest. That's when I realized what was really happening here. Emma, show me your phone, I said gently. She hesitated, glancing at Kevin nervously. It's okay, I said. Just show me. Her text messages with Kevin were.

My mom opened the door, looking annoyed. She took one look at me standing there in my pajamas, sweating and shaking, and sighed, Layla, it's the middle of the night. Stop being so dramatic and take some Pepto. We have work tomorrow. But, mom, this feels different. It really hurts, and I think I might need to go to the hospital. My dad's voice came from the bed. She's just trying to get attention. Tell her to go back to bed. My mom nodded and started closing the door. You heard your father. Go lie down and stop waking us up over nothing. I went back to my room and tried to sleep, but the pain kept getting worse. By two in the morning, I was throwing up bile and could barely think straight. I. I tried walking to the bathroom, but halfway down the hallway, everything went black. My little brother Kevin found me collapsed on the floor at four in the morning.

Some girls arrive at college ready for a fresh start, but Madison arrived like high school never ended. She lived three doors down and had somehow decided that my late night water runs were her business. The crime, existing in a tank top without a bra. The verdict, she was about to make it everyone's problem. It started with a knock on my door one Tuesday night. I just walked 10 yards to the water fountain in a white tank top, no bra because why would I? ANK was fitted but not see through. You could maybe see the outline of my nips if you were actively looking. Madison stood there twisting her rose gold ring, speaking in that fake concerned voice. Hey, so sorry to ask, but could you maybe put on a bra when you're in the hallway? My boyfriend's visiting and he was, um, staring a little. I'm non confrontational to a fault so I actually apologized. Yeah, sure, no problem. For the rest of that night, I threw on a hoodie every time I left my room. Whatever. Pick your battles, right? But the next morning my roommate came back from the bathroom looking pissed. You'll never guess what I just heard. She turns out Madison was in there with her squad doing a full Broadway reenactment of my water fountain trip. According to her version, I've been Practically topless, bending over suggestively, taking my sweet time while her poor boyfriend struggled to keep his virgin eyes off me. She actually demonstrated my supposed poses at the sink, complete with hair flips I definitely didn't do that night. I passed Madison and her friends in the hallway wearing pajama, no bra again because I forgotten her stupid request. She looked directly at my chest, whispered something and they all started giggling like middle schoolers who just discovered Urban Dictionary. The moment I snapped the email, R R a sent a building wide message about appropriate hallway attire and respecting communal spaces. Anonymous complaint, she said, but I knew exactly who'd submitted it. Some passive aggressive bull crap about keeping things covered up for everyone's comfort. Challenge accepted. If Madison was so worried about her boyfriend seeing the vague outline of my nips through a tank top, maybe the real problem wasn't my outfit. I did what any petty genius would do, research. Took me five minutes to find what I needed. See Madison's boy.

I was a court reporter when a seven year old had a meltdown during his parents custody hearing, and their reactions revealed everything the judge needed to know. The Hendersons had been fighting over custody of little Nathan for six months. Mom Susan arrived in a sharp business suit with her attorney, talking loudly about her promotion and new condo. Dad Tom look tired in his work clothes, having come straight from his construction job to make the two PM hearing. Susan's case seems strong. Higher income, stable housing, private school enrollment. Already arranged. Your honor. I can provide Nathan with opportunities his father simply cannot afford. Piano lessons, tutoring, summer camps. Tom's lawyer did his best, but the numbers didn't lie. Tom worked long hours for half Susan's salary and lived in a modest apartment. When asked about extracurriculars, Tom quietly said, I help with his homework every night and we go to the park on weekends. Midway through Susan's testimony about her comprehensive parenting plan, Nathan started fidgeting in the gallery where he'd been sitting with a social worker. The seven year old had been silent for an hour, but suddenly stood up and said loudly, I need to use the bathroom. The social worker started to get up, but before she could react, both parents moved. What happened next lasted maybe 10 seconds, but it changed everything. Susan snapped, Nathan, sit down. We're in the middle of Something important. You should have gone before we came in here. She didn't even turn around fully, just shot him an annoyed look over her shoulder. Tom immediately stood up, walked over to Nathan, and knelt down to his eye level. Hey, buddy, of course you can go. Let's go right now. He took Nathan's hand naturally, like he'd done it a thousand times. I don't want to interrupt the important meeting, Nathan whispered, clearly anxious. You're not interrupting anything, Tom said softly. You're the most important thing here. As they walked toward the door, Nathan suddenly stopped and burst into tears. Not bathroom urgency tears. The big, overwhelming sobs of a stressed seven year old who'd been holding it together too long. Susan's reaction was to look at her watch and whisper urgently to her lawyer about the delay. She kept glancing at the door like their son's breakdown was an inconvenience to her testimony. Tom just picked Nathan up and held him, not caring that his son's tears were soaking his work shirt. He didn't try to stop the crying or rush him through it. He just stood there, rubbing his back, whispering, it's okay, buddy. Take your time. When Nathan finally calmed down enough to whisper something in his dad's ear, Tom nodded and carried him back into the courtroom. Your honor, Nathan would like to tell you something, if that's okay.

The one that got me grounded for a month. My dad had this iron clad rule in our house. Whoever complained about dinner had to cook the next night's meal for the entire family. It was his brilliant strategy to shut us up about my stepmom Raylan's absolutely catastrophic cooking. For two solid years, nobody dared say a word. Her meatloaf could legitimately break windows. Her chicken was drier than the Sahara Desert. And her famous casseroles tasted like she mixed random leftovers with sadness and baked it at 450 degrees until it surrendered. But we all just sat there choking down every bite like good little soldiers because nobody wanted to face the humiliation of trying to cover six people. Then came that unforgettable Tuesday night when Raylan decided to get creative with deconstructed tacos. I'm using air quotes here because what she actually served was literally just wilted iceberg lettuce, stone cold ground beef straight from the pan, and stale hard shell tortillas that crumbled if you looked at them wrong. Everything was on separate plates like some kind of sad, depressing buffet. My ten year old sister Opal, took one look at her plate, tried to eat everything, and was still visibly hungry. Afterward, she's started tearing up because her stomach was growling. And that's when something inside me just completely snapped. Raylan, this isn't dinner. This is what happens when a grocery store display gives up on life. The Entire dining room went dead silent. Dad's fork froze halfway to his mouth, and I could practically see the gears turning in his head. Raylan's face turned bright red, and my older brother Paxton was staring at me like I just signed my own death warrant. Dad slowly put down on his fork, cleared his throat, and said with this smug little smile, well, congratulations, kiddo. Looks like you're cooking tomorrow night's dinner for all of us. But here's the thing dad had absolutely no clue about. For the past six months, I've been working weekend shifts at my Uncle JoJo's Italian restaurant downtown. Not just busing tables or washing dishes, but actually learning everything from knife skills to sauce preparation to proper seasoning techniques. Josue had been teaching me real cooking because he said I had natural instincts and could potentially work in professional kitchens someday. Every Saturday and Sunday, I'd spend eight hours learning how to make fresh pasta, proper marinara from scratch, and authentic Italian techniques passed down through three generations. The next evening, I walked into our kitchen with a game plan. I stopped at the grocery store after school and bought actual fresh ingredients with my restaurant money. Real ground beef, fresh tomatoes, white onions, authentic Mexican spices, masa harina for tortillas, and everything needed for proper street tacos. I spent three hours hand pressing corn tortillas, slow cooking carnitas until they were fall apart tender, making fresh PICO de Gallo with perfectly diced ingredients. Crafting homemade salsa Verde.

My maid of honor was halfway through her beautiful toast when Allison stood up. She clinked her glass dramatically and walked to the front. She took the microphone right out of my friend's hand. Sorry, but I have something important to share while everyone's here. She announced, pulled her boyfriend Craig up beside her. She told the entire room they were adopting a baby from Korea. My guests erupted in confused congratulations while my maid of honor stood there holding her speech cards uselessly. The rest of my reception became the Allison Show. People kept coming up to her for details about the adoption. Someone started a collection for baby supplies using the envelope box meant for our cards. The photographer spent 20 minutes doing an impromptu photo shoot of her and Craig. My mom found me crying in the bathroom and told Me? I was being dramatic. She just excited about becoming a mother. She said you should be happy for family. My aunt agreed that Alison was just enthusiastic about sharing good news. Two months later, at Sunday dinner, Alison announced her wedding date. She went on and on about her vintage Hollywood glamour theme. She'd already booked the historic Grandview Manor downtown. Craig sat there nodding while she showed everyone her Pinterest boards. I want it to be absolutely perfect, she gushed. No interruptions or distractions, just all eyes on us for once. The irony nearly choked me, but I smiled and said it sounded lovely. That night, I started planning. Allison's fatal flaw was her complete blindness to her own behavior. She genuinely believed she was just sharing joy. She couldn't understand why anyone would mind. She also had zero ability to handle competition for attention. I reached out to my college theatre friends first. My roommate, Macy ran an improv group that specialized in flash mobs and public performances. When I explained my idea, she literally cackled with delight. Within a week, I had 12 performers committed to the cause. The tricky part was getting them into the wedding. I studied Alison's guest list when she left it at my mom's house. Several couples had generic plus one RSVPs. Macy's performers could pose as dates for single guests. I knew. I reached out to these friends and explained the situation. Every single one wanted to help after hearing About my wedding, the wedding was as over the top as expected. Allison had seven bridesmaids and released doves during the ceremony. The reception ballroom dripped with crystals and white roses. My performers were scattered perfectly throughout the room as planned guests, everything started during dinner service. At exactly 6:30, Macy stood up at table four and let out a shriek. Her fake boyfriend was on one knee between the salad and soup courses. The whole room turned to watch as she said yes. He slipped a costume jewelry ring on her finger. Alison's smile froze, but she started clapping along with everyone else at 6:45 during the champagne toast.

Eighty five dollars. We're laughing, having a good time, taking birthday photos. Kate is being the perfect hostess. Then the check comes, $230. Kate looks at it and starts patting down her tiny purse, checking her jacket pockets, looking under the table. Oh my god, you guys, I am so embarrassed. I totally forgot my wallet at home.

What did you learn? When Nathan took me to his family's mansion for the first time, I knew I didn't belong. The driveway was longer than my entire street, and their garage held more cars than my apartment building's parking lot. I was a waitress putting myself through nursing school, and he was the heir to a real estate empire. I tried hiding my background at first. I'd make excuses not to go to fancy restaurants, saying I wasn't hungry or had already eaten. When he bought me designer bags, I'd return them secretly and use the money for textbooks. I even practiced using the right forks at dinner by watching YouTube videos late at night. But Nathan wasn't like his family. He drove a beat up Volkswagen and wore the same three hoodies on rotation. When he found out I was returning his gifts, he started buying me practical things instead. Grocery store gift cards, gas money, nursing scrubs. Never made me feel small. His mother, Andrea, was different. She'd ask questions like, what country club did your family belong to? Or which prep school did you attend? When I admitted I went to public school, she'd purse her lips and change the subject. Once she accidentally spilled red wine on my only nice dress at a family dinner. Things got worse when Nathan proposed. Andrea cornered me in the kitchen during our engagement party. How much? She asked, pulling out her checkbook. Name your price to walk away. You clearly only want his money. I was hurt, but stood my ground. I love your son. I'm not going anywhere. Two weeks later, she showed up at the diner where I worked, ordering coffee and staying for my entire shift. She left religious pamphlets about marrying within your class with her 10 cent tip. My hands shook so bad, I dropped three plates that day. Then came the custody battle. Nathan's cousin Amy had lost her kids to social services after a drug relapse. She was rich, well connected, and desperate to adopt. But no agency would approve her with her history. That's when she found Tommy. Tommy was a sweet six year old boy from my old neighborhood. His mom was my regular at the diner, a single mother working three jobs. When she got sick with cancer, she asked me to help find Tommy a good home. I promised I would. Nathan and I applied to adopt Tommy. We had a stable home, good jobs. I'd finish nursing school by then, and so much love to give. The social worker loved us. Tommy would come for weekend visits, and we'd build blanket forts and make homemade pizzas together. But Andrea and Amy had other plans. Hired expensive lawyers, claiming we were financially unstable. They dug up my father's old Duis, my mother's welfare records. They painted me as white trash trying to climb the social ladder through Nathan. The final blow. Came when they offered Tommy's dying mother $50,000 to change her recommendation to Amy. She was drowning in medical bills. She took the deal. I was destroyed. But Nathan surprised everyone. He walked into the final court hearing and announced he was given

I was working at the steakhouse called the Cedar Room when this family started coming in every Friday night. The dad would snap his fingers at me like I was his personal servant, demanding water refills before I could even set down their menus. The mom constantly sent food back claiming it was too cold or too salty, obviously just fishing for discounts. Their son, Nathan, this 14 year old with the smuggest face you've ever seen, was the absolute worst. From the moment they walked in, Nathan acted like he owned the place. He'd make comments like, do you even know how to write down orders right? And don't mess up my steak like last time, even though I'd never served him before. The kid would deliberately throw bread crumbs on the floor while staring me down, then tell his parents, this guy looks like he couldn't afford a haircut. His parents would just laugh and nod along like he was some comedy genius. Every week I dreaded seeing them walk through that door. The hostess Sarah, would give me this apologetic look whenever she seated them in my section. Other servers started avoiding eye contact when the family showed up, grateful it wasn't their turn to deal with the nightmare table. One Friday evening in December, I was having an especially rough day. My car had broken down that morning and I was already stressed about The repair costs. When I saw Nathan's family walk in, my heart sank. They got seated in my section again. I brought out their usual order, trying to stay professional despite Nathan's constant snide remarks. I bet you can't even afford what's on this plate, he said with this evil smirk, pointing at his perfectly cooked rib eye steak. Before I could respond, he grabbed the edge of the plate and flipped it over, sending the hot steak and mashed potatoes directly onto my shoes. The gravy splattered all over my uniform. His parents burst out laughing like it was the funniest thing they'd ever seen.

My real name wasn't Brandon. It was Dolores. Yeah, you heard that right. My parents named me after my great grandma because her will said any first born kid named after her would get half her money when they turned 18. My parents really wanted that cash so they figured they'd just stick me with it and I deal with it later. When I was little, I didn't get why it was so bad. I mean, I knew it was weird, but mom kept saying it was special. He'd tell everyone at the grocery store or the dentist office about how I was named after Great Grandma Dolores and how it meant I'd be rich someday. People would smile but their eyes looked confused when they saw me standing there in my Dinosaur shirt and Batman sneakers. Kindergarten was when it started getting really bad. Teacher called roll on the first day and said Dolores Martinez and everyone turned to look at me. This kid named Tyler laughed so hard he fell out of his chair. From that day on, kids called me Dolores the Explorer or Dolores the doofus. I tried to ignore it, but it was every single day. I begged my parents to let me use my middle name, Kyle. It was right there, normal, easy. But mom would get this angry look and say, don't be ungrateful. That name is your future. That Name is putting you through college. Dad would just shrug and change the subject. By 3rd grade, I stopped raising my hand in class. The teacher called on me. Everyone would snicker when she said my name. I started eating lunch in the bathroom just to avoid the cafeteria where kids would yell, hey, Dolores, where's your purse? Or Dolores, did you do your nails today? Middle school was somehow worse. School database had my legal name in it. So every substitute teacher, every school assembly, every time they announced on a roll over the intercom, there it was, Dolores Martinez. Kids would howl with laughter, got shoved into lockers. Someone wrote Dolores is a girl on my gym locker in permanent marker. I tried going by just d in 8th grade for like 2 months. It worked. My friends called me D. I felt almost normal. Then this substitute in English class looked at the roster and said, Dolores, that's adorable. Is there a Dolores?

My parents sat with their arms crossed like they were about to deliver bad news. I walked into the living room wearing my lottery winner T-shirt from the ceremony and carrying the framed photo.

This whole time I've been a millionaire watching you treat me like garbage. The room exploded. Ashley's face went white, then red. You've been lying to us for two months, Alex started. Stop uttering apologies. I mean, I was going to help. I just thought you'd figure it out yourself. My parents were the angriest. This is manipulative, mom said. We raised you better than this. You wanna talk about manipulation? I said, let's talk about charging your unemployed son. Rent to live in his childhood bedroom. Dad stood. We deserve our fair share of this money. We're your family.

Omar, your daughter's wedding is covered. Miguel, your son's medical bills are handled. My family lost their minds. Ashley started screaming about blood being thicker than water. Alex demanded to know why strangers were getting his inheritance. My parents threatened to disown me. You can't disown someone you already abandoned, I said. They stormed out, slamming doors and shouting about lawyers and family loyalty. My real family, the one I chose, stayed for pizza. Sometimes the people who owe you nothing give you everything.

I faked being broke after winning the lottery to see who'd stick around. Last month, I won 2.4 million on a scratch off at the gas station near my apartment. The cashier congratulated me. I signed the back, took the photo with the giant check, the whole thing. But instead of celebrating, I had this sinking feeling about what would happen when my family found out. See, I'd always been the one they called when they needed money, car repairs, rent, medical bills. I was their personal ATM. But I'd never been in real trouble myself, so I didn't know if they'd return the favor. So I decided to test them. I locked the lottery ticket in a safety deposit box and started my performance. First, I called out sick from my warehouse job for a week, then told everyone I'd been fired for attendance issues, budget cuts. I said last hired, first fired. Then I started the money complaints. Rent was due, bank account was empty, unem employment wouldn't kick in for weeks. I sold my PlayStation, my bike, anything that looked valuable made it look desperate. The reactions were brutal and immediate. My sister Ashley, who I'd helped with three different car payments, stop up inviting me to family dinners. We can't afford extra mouths right now, she said when I asked about Sunday dinner. Maybe when you get back on your feet. My brother Alex, whose Entire college tuition I'd covered when our parents couldn't suddenly never answered my calls. When he finally texted back, it was always busy with work or can't talk right now. This from the guy who used to call me twice a week. My parents were the worst. Suggested I move back into my childhood bedroom but wanted me to pay them $800 a month rent. It'll teach you responsibility, dad said. Maybe this is the wake up call you needed. Meanwhile, my elderly neighbor, Margaret, who I barely knew beyond polite hallway conversations, started showing up with groceries. Everyone needs help sometimes, she said, refusing to let me pay her back. Just help someone else when you can. My coworker Steve from the warehouse offered to cover my lunch every day. We weren't even that close. Just work friends who talked about sports. You do the same for me, he said. When I protested, the guy at my corner Bodega, Omar, started letting.

You know white isn't the bridal color in Indian weddings, right? I froze. In all my panic about Kayla's manipulation tactics, I completely forgotten that crucial detail. Kayla had no idea Priya would be wearing a stunning red lehenga with intricate gold embroidery. Wedding day arrives. I'm getting ready with my groomsmen when my cousin texts, dude, your sister just walked in looking like she thinks she's the bride. My stomach dropped until I remembered Priya's words. Then I actually started laughing. Kayla struts in wearing this elaborate white ball gown, strapless with a cathedral train, clearly custom made and expensive. She'd even hired a professional makeup artist and had her hair done in an elaborate updo with white flowers. The confused looks from Priya's family were absolutely priceless. Indian weddings are vibrant, colourful celebrations. And here's Kayla looking like she wandered in from a completely different century. During the ceremony, I kept glancing at Kayla. She looked increasingly uncomfortable as she realised everyone was staring at her for all the wrong reasons. Priya looked absolutely radiant in her traditional red and gold, surrounded by family and brilliant blues, greens and purples, while Kayla stood out like a sore thumb in stark white. But the absolute best part came during the reception. Priya's grandmother, this tiny 80 year old woman who'd flown in from Mumbai, walked straight up to Kayla. In her thick accent, she loudly asked, Zeta, why are you dressed for a funeral at a wedding? Did someone die that we should know about? The entire hall went silent, then erupted in laughter. Kayla's face went bright red as she stammered some excuse about western traditions. But Nani wasn't done. In my day, only widows wore white to celebrations. Are you mourning something dear? Should we be concerned? More laughter rippled through the crowd. Even my parents were chuckling behind their hands. Kayla realized she looked completely ridiculous in white, while the actual bride glowed in traditional colors, surrounded by guests and vibrant sorries and lahangas that made her look like a ghost at a rainbow party. She grabbed her purse and left early, muttering about cultural misunderstandings and disrespectful in laws. Meanwhile, everyone spent the rest of the night complimenting Priya's stunning outfit and asking about the beautiful traditions. For once, Kayla's desperate attempt to steal the spotlight completely backfired. Best wedding gift ever.

When I graduated with honors, she showed up in a revealing red dress and spent the whole ceremony flirting with professors. The pattern never stopped. Kayla had this way of making herself the victim. And whenever I achieved anything, you're so lucky, she'd say. I sacrificed so much for you. Growing up, meanwhile, I was the one babysitting her kids while she partied through her 20s. I was the one lending her money she never paid back. I was the one covering for her when she bailed on family obligations. When I got engaged to my Indian fiance, Priya, I was terrified Kayla would find a way to ruin it. Sure enough, at our engagement party, she immediately joked about wearing white to our wedding. It'll be so funny, she laughed, like in the movies, I'll be the mysterious woman in white. She even made this dramatic pose, hand on her forehead like some soap opera actress. I pulled her aside and told her, absolutely not. This is my one day. Kayla, please. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic, that it was just a joke. God, you're so sensitive. It's not like anyone would actually confuse me for the bride. But she seemed to agree to drop it. Two weeks later, I found out she'd gone behind my back and asked Priya directly, your sister seems really excited about her dress choice. Priya mentioned casually over dinner, she kept asking about fabric and styles. My blood ran cold. I knew exactly what that meant. I freaked out on Priya explaining Kayla's entire history of stealing my moments. She did this at my high school graduation, wore this attention grabbing red dress and flirted with all the dads. At my college graduation, she announced her pregnancy. She'll definitely show up in some elaborate white gown designed to make everyone look at her instead of us. That night I had a complete breakdown, sobbing, hyperventilating. 28 years of suppressed resentment came pouring out. I was convinced Priya would see my toxic family dynamics and run for the hills. Who wants to marry into that kind of drama? Instead, she held me and.

Court clerk for eight years. This divorced dad was fighting for custody of his six year old daughter. His ex wife claimed he was an alcoholic who endangered their kid. She came prepared for war, had photos of beer bottles scattered around his house, testimony from three neighbours about loud parties and even a police report about a disturbance at his address. Her lawyer was this slick eye in a three thousand dollar suit who clearly done his homework. The evidence looked damning. Photos showed empty bottles everywhere, kitchen counter, coffee table, bathroom sink, even one in the kids toy box next to her stuffed bunny. The neighbours swore they'd seen him stumbling around drunk at two PM on weekdays, music blasting at all hours. One elderly neighbour claimed she'd called C P. S twice because the little girl looked neglected and scared. Her lawyer painted him as a complete deadbeat, said he missed scheduled visitations because he was too drunk to drive. Claimed the daughter came home crying, talking about daddy's angry voice, how the house smelled like yucky medicine. The guy sat there quietly throughout the whole character assassination. No fancy suit, just wrinkled khakis and a polo shirt, clutching a Manila folder like his life depended on it. I've seen plenty of custody battles and this one looked over before it started. The judge was taking detailed notes, nodding along with the ex wife's testimony. She was Crying at all the right moments, playing the devastated mother perfectly. Even I was starting to feel sorry for her. Judge looked ready to rule against him. When he finally asked to speak, his voice was shaky. Nervous. Your honor, when exactly did she say I missed those visits? October 15th, 22nd and 29th. The ex wife replied confidently, stabbing her eyes with a tissue. He opened his folder with trembling hands. Here's my work schedule from the fire station. I'm a paramedic. I was saving lives. Those exact dates, 24 hour shifts, two car accidents and a heart attack on the 15th. Apartment fire on the 22nd, three car pile up on the 29th. The paperwork was official.

In my family, there was one rule. I needed my twin's permission to seek medical help. I was watching Vanessa practice her birthday speech when my lungs seized up. I reached for my inhaler on the coffee table, but mom snatched it away. Vanessa, does Ellie need this? My twin didn't even look up from her phone. She used it at lunch. She fine. You heard your sister. Mom dropped my inhaler in her purse. No attention seeking today. It's Vanessa's sweet 16th. The rule had been in place since we were 12. The day I faked pneumonia during Vanessa's ballet recital. I hadn't faked it, but Vanessa said I had, so that became the truth. From then on, every headache, every fever, every asthma attack had to be verified by the golden twin. Can't breathe. The wheeze was starting. That whistling sound my doctor called your body's alarm bell. Ellie! Dad's voice boomed from the door way. What do we do when you claim you're sick? I knew the script. Ask Vanessa first. And what did Vanessa say? Vanessa finally looked up, annoyed. I said, she's fine. Gosh, Ellie, do you have to make my day about you? My chest was tightening like someone was sitting on it. Spread out like sucking air through a coffee stirrer. Please! I gasped. Need hospital, mom! Vanessa whined. She's doing it again. Make her stop! Mom rushed to comfort Vanessa. Don't worry, Sweetie! Ellie, go to your room if you're going to act like this. The modelling scout will be here soon. I tried to stand, but had to grip the couch. My fingernails were starting to tinge blue. Look! I held up my hands. Vanessa laughed. She probably painted them blue. Remember when she faked passing out at my recital? I hadn't faked it. I had an asthma attack. But Vanessa told everyone I was jealous. So my parents refused to leave her performance. The doorbell rang. Party guests started to arrive. Ellie, disappear! Dad ordered. Vanessa's modelling scout is coming. We don't need you wheezing in the background. I couldn't move. My lungs were working overtime through my shirt. Every breath was a battle I was losing. Mom, please! I need hospital! Vanessa! Mom called out sweetly, your sister's asking for the hospital. What do you think, Vanessa? She stood directly in front of me, blocking my parents view for a second. I saw something flicker in her eyes. She's faking! Vanessa announced loudly. She's just mad Ted's coming. Ted? My childhood friend who Vanessa stole just because she could. I knew it! Mom shouted, Ellie, stop this immediately! That's when I started coughing blood. Vanessa's best friend, Jenny walked in and froze. Oh my gosh! What's wrong with Ellie? Nothing, Vanessa said quickly. She's being dramatic, Vanessa. She's coughing blood! No, they're not! Vanessa stepped in front of me again. Everything's perfect. Go help with decorations. But Jenny was Premed. She pushed past Vanessa and grabbed my wrist. Her pulse is racing. This is a medical emergency. We don't do medical emergencies without Vanessa's approval. Dad said like it was totally normal. House rules. What? Jenny looked horrified. Vanessa knows Ellie best, mom explained. She can tell when Ellie's really sick. Versus performing. Performing? Jenny was already dialling 9 1 1. She's in respiratory failure. Give me that phone!

My grandmother told me stop renting apartments and buy the worst house in the best neighborhood you can afford. Fix it up yourself and you'll thank me in 20 years. When I was 24, I just got my first real job as a nurse and was looking at nice rental apartments. Everyone my age was living in trendy downtown lofts, showing off their granite countertops and gym amenities. But grandma pulled me aside at Sunday dinner and made me drive with her through this expensive neighborhood I'd never considered. She pointed at this tiny rundown house with peeling paint and an overgrown yard that I saw has been on the market for eight months. She said nobody wants it because it looks terrible next to these million dollar homes, but the bones are good and you can't fake location. I looked at her like she was crazy. The house was hideous, broken shutters, dead lawn, probably needed everything redone. Grandma, I don't know how to fix houses. I barely know how to change a light bulb. She laughed. I didn't know how to raise four kids until I had them. You learn by doing. That conversation stuck with me for weeks. I toured shiny rental apartments with my friends. Finally, I called a realtor and looked at Grandma's ugly house. It was worse inside, carpet from the 1970s, pink bathroom tile, kitchen cabinets that looked like they belonged in a Trailer. But it was in the best school district in the city, walking distance to parks and surrounded by houses worth 10 times more. I put in an offer, $40,000 below asking price. Accepted immediately, my friends thought I'd lost my mind. Every time we hung out, they'd show off their modern amenities while roasting my dump. One friend said I could never live somewhere that embarrassing. What if I brought a date home to that disaster? Another kept joking that I was living in the neighborhood crack house. They brag about their rooftop pools and doorman, then ask if my house had running water yet. I'll admit pulling up next to their luxury buildings in my beat up Honda, I wondered if grandma was wrong. But then, and I'd remember her saying, pretty apartments make you a renter forever. Ugly houses make you wealthy. For three years, I spent every weekend at Home Depot learning to do everything myself. You two became my construction university. I love and drywall, plumbing, electrical work, landscaping, whatever needed fixing. My social life basically ended because everyone assumed I was too broke to go out. While my friends were posting Instagram stories from expensive restaurants, I was covered in paint trying to make my house livable. Slowly, I started recognizing what good bones actually meant. The foundation was solid. The roof just needed new shingles. The plumbing was old but function most importantly, three more houses on my street sold to young families willing To renovate, and property values started climbing fast. The neighborhood was gentrifying, exactly like grandma predicted. Coffee shops opened, new restaurants moved in. The elementary school got renovated and started winning awards. Then the pandemic hit and everything changed suddenly.

Is Daisy Williams present in school today? My teacher, Missus Harrah, clicked the intercom button. Yes, the principal's voice echoed. Lockdown now. This is not a drill. The way he said it made my blood freeze. Missus Harrah shrieked under the desks. Lights off. Move, move, move. Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. I couldn't help but think he was after me. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Missus Harrah tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. Screaming got louder and it wasn't just one voice anymore. Multiple people in different parts of the building. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that the shooter was right outside and I believed them. Pia grabbed my hand and her palms were soaked with sweat. I could see Mister Kids class across the hall through our door window. Lights already off, no movement, just darkness where 20 kids should have been. I looked at our teacher and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids and told us it would be okay. But after a while, she Got up again and walked back to her laptop. Then we heard it, footsteps running past our door. Thud, thud, thud. I couldn't help myself. I had to look. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall, pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops. Get away from the door, Daisy. Missus Harrah whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Even Missus Harrah stood up slowly and crept to the door to check the window before opening it. That's when it flung open. The principal stood there with an actual cop who had his hand resting on his gun. You, Daisy, come with us. Immediately, my worst fear confirmed. The tutor had sent them or maybe they thought I was involved somehow. Missus Harra looked between them and me, confused. Get your things, honey, Missus Harra said. And that scared me more than anything because in three years of chemistry class, she'd never called me honey. Every single person was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack with shaking hands. The hallway was complete chaos. More cops than I'd ever seen in one place. I heard a paramedic shout, we're losing him. Move as he flew past us. My classmates were pressed against the door windows in every room, watching me get escorted by police like I was a criminal. They steered me to the main office but passed reception into the Conference room. The cop finally spoke. Your dad is here? Well, my parents are divorced and I hadn't seen him since I was 7. So now I was really confused. Dad. He grabbed me in a hug so tight I couldn't breathe and his whole body shook against mine. I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. My ex Marine father, who always encouraged me to be stoic and suppress my feelings was crying his eyes out. Sorry for what? What's happening? Is there a shooter? Are people dead? I pulled back to look at him and he held my face in both hands. His hands were freezing. There's no.

When you're sick with a bad head cold and your nose is completely blocked on both sides and there's so much inflammation it feels hot within. Then when the combination of meds and anatomical adjustments hit that sweet spot and one nostril spontaneously unblocks as you feel the pressure gradient change and cool air rushes in for the first time in hours. 6.

Now my he wants my house. When I was 16, my gaming obsessed brother Tyler convinced my parents I was taking up too much space in our cramped three bedroom apartment. He'd been complaining for months that he needed my room for his elaborate gaming setup. My parents sat me down one evening and basically said I had two weeks to find alternative living arrangements. The reasoning? I was almost 17, practically an adult, and Tyler needed space to pursue his passion in gaming and dreaming. They genuinely believed he was going to become the next big Twitch star. I was devastated, but had nowhere to go. My girlfriend Emma's parents noticed I'd been spending more time at their house and eventually asked what was going on. When I explained the situation, her mom immediately said I could stay with them as long as I needed, no questions asked. Emma and I got serious fast. Living under the same roof will do that to a relationship. When we turned 19, I proposed with a ring. I'd saved six months for working overtime every weekend. Parents were thrilled. They basically raised me for two years anyway and considered me their son. At 23, we finally had enough saved for a down payment on a small two bedroom house. Nothing fancy. We spent every weekend renovating, learning YouTube tutorials, making mistakes, and fixing them. Meanwhile, Tyler was still living with my parents in his gaming paradise. He dropped out of community college after one semester, claiming his streaming career was about to take off and college was just holding him back. Three years later, he was still grinding away at maybe five viewers on a good day. Sleeping until two PM, gaming until 4:00am, ordering Doordash with my parents money. My parents occasionally texted generic holiday messages or shared Facebook posts about family, but otherwise we had zero relationship. Last month my mom showed up at my house completely unannounced. I hadn't seen her.

Within a week, his entire family moved three states away, ghosted me, blocked me, vanished like a coward in a Letterman jacket. But I wasn't going to be a statistic. My parents were furious but weirdly supportive. They helped me finish high school online and I gave birth to my son Tommy over Christmas break with jingle bells playing in the background. Cute, right? Tommy and I basically grew up together. I worked three jobs while getting my nursing degree. Mom watched him when she could. We ate so much ramen that he thought it was a food group. We lived in a tiny shoebox apartment with a couch I bought off Craigslist for $15 and dreams duct taped together. But it worked. By the time Tommy was 10, I was a pediatric ICU nurse and he was this funny, smart, ridiculous little human who made life fun even on two hours of sleep. Then I met Daniel. Daniel's a pediatric surgeon, smart, kind, didn't blink when I told him I had a 10 year old. On our third date, Tommy had a cold and Daniel brought over soup and comic books. I think I fell in love right then. Two years later, we got married and Daniel adopted Tommy. Tommy calls him dad like he Was born to because honestly, he kind of was. We had twin girls three years ago and Tommy is the sweetest big brother. Straight a student, star pitcher for his high school and I mean star college scouts come to see him. Then last month, his team made it to the state championships. I was screaming my lungs out from the bleachers, phone in hand, filming every pitch like a full blown stage, mom. That's when I saw Jake. Same face, just older. He was staring at Tommy like he was.

For 10 years, my husband gave me the same kind of lame birthday gift. And I was starting to think our marriage was falling apart. But on our 10th anniversary, he handed me a strange piece of paper that finally explained everything. My husband Tom, is a good man. He remembers to take out the trash. He makes me coffee every morning and he tells me I'm beautiful even when my hair is a mess. But he is a terrible gift giver. Horrible. Every year for my birthday and on our anniversary, I get my hopes up and every year he'd hand me a small, disappointingly light box. The first year it was a weirdly shaped, smooth gray rock, the kind you'd find on a beach. I smiled and said thank you, hiding the confusion on my face, a rock. For our first anniversary, I put it in my jewelry box where it rattled around, a lonely reminder of his strange choice. The next year it was a single rusty looking key. It didn't open anything in our house. I tried every lock. The year after that, a pressed daisy so fragile I was scared to touch it. Then came a cheap looking silver charm of a coffee cup. Even though I didn't own a charm bracelet, it became a running joke with my friends. What weird thing did Tom get you this year? My friend Sarah would ask. I'd show Her the newest oddity, a ticket stub from a movie we saw two years ago. A brightly coloured guitar pick, even though neither of us played an instrument, a tiny shell. I tried to talk to him about it once. Gently, I asked if maybe we could just go on a trip for my birthday instead of exchanging gifts. He looked so hurt, his face just fell. He said the gifts were important to him, that they, I meant something. I didn't have the heart to tell him they meant nothing to me but confusion. So I pretended I'd open the small box, look at the strange little object inside and give him my best fake smile. Oh, honey, it's so thoughtful, I'd say. My heart sinking a little more each time. Inside, I was starting to worry. Did he not know me at all? Was this a sign find that he wasn't paying attention? The gifts felt so impersonal, so random. It felt like he was grabbing whatever was in his pocket on the way home from work. My insecurity grew with every passing year. We were happy, but this one thing felt like a crack in our foundation. It was a yearly reminder that maybe we weren't as connected as I thought. Last week was our 10th anniversary, a decade. I convinced myself this year would be different. Ten years is a big deal. He had to be planning something special. I imagined a necklace, a weekend away. Something that said, I know you, I love you, and I've been listening for 10 years. He came home from work with a bouquet of.

I was driving out of my gated community when this lady jumped off the curb right in front of my car. She was screaming and waving her arms like she was directing airplane traffic. I slammed my brakes and coffee went everywhere. She rushed to my window, demanding to know if I lived there. Her face was red and spit flew as she yelled about watching me drive through her neighborhood. Her husband jogged over, looking mortified in his cargo shorts and polo shirt. Karen, please, he said, grabbing her elbow. This is our neighbor from the Blue house. She shook him off and demanded my driver's license like she was neighborhood security. Her pom pom slippers made her authority act even more ridiculous. Instead of getting mad, I just started laughing. You know what, come over for drinks this afternoon. Let's get to know each other better as neighbors. The husband's jaw dropped. That's, that's very kind of you. Karen kept sputtering about documentation while her husband. I dragged her away, apologizing. I drove home sticky with coffee, but oddly amused by the whole thing. Four hours later, I walked to their house carrying red and white wine. Mitchell answered, looking shocked. I actually came behind him, Karen shrieked. Absolutely not. From their living room, Mitchell's face went crimson as he stood in the doorway doing that awkward shuffle. I'm so sorry she's, she's not feeling social, but maybe I could stop by Your place in an hour. I shrugged and walked home. Sure enough, an hour later, Mitchell knocked, carrying a six pack. We sat on my porch and he practically collapsed into a chair. I'm really sorry about this morning. Karen's been getting worse lately. She watches the neighborhood Facebook page like it's her job. We cracked open beers and talked. Mitchell was a software engineer who worked from home and seemed desperate for normal conversation. We discovered we both loved craft beer and hated the HOA rules. After his third beer, he admitted Karen had called the police on three other neighbors this month alone. I keep telling her she's going to get us sued, but she thinks she's protecting property values, he said, miserably. We ordered pizza and moved inside to watch the game. Mitchell relaxed for the first time all day. He kept thanking me for being understanding and not filing a complaint about the morning incident. You know what's crazy, Mitchell said during halftime. In 23 years of marriage, this is the first time I've just hung out with a friend without asking permission. We were laughing about the HOA's latest ridiculous rule about grass height when Mitchell's phone started buzzing. He ignored it. Then it rang and rang and rang. Maybe you should answer, I suggested. Mitchell shook his head. She's probably calling to demand I come home. For once, I'm going to enjoy my evening. His phone finally stopped. We high fived and opened another Beer, the third quarter had just started when I noticed something odd. A car had driven past my house three times, then another. They were moving slowly like they were looking for addresses. Hey, hey, Mitchell, does Karen know my exact house number? No. Why? That's when we heard the sirens. Not just 1 or 2, but what sounded like every cop car in the county. The noise got louder and louder until red and blue lights were flashing through every window. I peeked through the blinds and my blood went cold. Multiple police cars had surrounded my house. Officers were taking positions behind their vehicles with weapons drawn. More cars kept arriving. I could see officers moving through my backyard. They had the whole property surrounded. Oh, my god, Mitchell whispered, looking through another window. What did she tell them? In my driveway, I can see Karen talking animatedly to what looked like a police captain. She was gesturing wildly at my house and I could see her mouth forming words that looked like dangerous and hostile. Even from here, her pom pom slippers looked ridiculous against the severity of what was happening. A megaphone crackled to life. This is the police. We have the house completely surrounded. We know you're in there. Mitchell and I looked at each other in terror. Whatever Karen had told them, it was clearly more than just my husband is watching football. The tactical positions the officers were taking suggested they thought something Serious was happening inside. Should I go out there? Mitchell asked, his face pale. Wait, I said, let me think. If she, if I tell them you're in danger and you walk out, fine, they'll know she lied. But if they think I'm dangerous, the megaphone crackled again. You have 30 seconds to respond before we escalate. Release the hostage immediately. Hostage, she told them Mitchell was a hostage. My hands started shaking as I realized how bad this could get. At one wrong move and this could end with me dead on my own living room floor. Mitchell reached for the door handle, but I grabbed his arm. Outside I could hear more sirens approaching. Whatever happened next would happen fast. Through the window, I saw an officer with s W. A. T. Gear arriving on scene. The megaphone counted down 20 seconds. My heart was pounding so hard I could barely breathe. Mitchell looked at me with panic in his eyes as we both realized Karen might have finally gone too far. 10 seconds. Full story link below.

Mom's eating breakfast scrolling through Facebook while Dad's counting out quarters for gas money when she announces we're all downloading Life 3, 60. We're two months behind on the electrical, but her friend says this app is the only way to keep family safe and honest. I'm 17 and work hard time at target while my dad does construction. We don't have time to be anything but safe and honest, she says. If we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear, which sounds like something a dictator would say. But whatever, she makes us install it right there at the table and checks that everyone's location is on. And I realised immediately what she doesn't understand about this app. Life 3, 60 doesn't just show where you are, it shows your speed when driving, your phone battery and sends notifications for everything, including when someone checks someone else's location. Mom works from home doing medical billing and has nothing but time to watch that app all day while dad and I are actually out in the world. Perfect. Now I'll know everyone's safe, she says. But what she means is now she can watch us like the musical jolly chimp from Toy Story. Her phone buzzes and she glances at it. Oh, shoot, I have a doctor's appointment in an hour. Dad offers to drive her, but she says no, she needs the car. All day for errands. After months ago, my mom asked me to start covering for her when she goes out saying she's shopping or at the doctors. Whenever dad asks where she is, men lose interest when you mention women. Things she tell me she doesn't realise. She just set herself up. Day one and my phone buzzes every 10 minutes with mom, check your location. While I'm at school, dad text me she checked me 14 times this morning and we both realise she's literally sitting. They're refreshing the app constantly instead of working. Day 3, mom calls me screaming because the app says I was going 67 and a 65 and threatens to take my keys. So I start driving under the speed limit, which means I'm late to work and my manager writes me up. Dad gets stuck in traffic, won't go even 1 mile per hour over because mom will see shows up 30 minutes late to his job site and loses the client. Client worth $2,000. Week 2, she sees I stopped at McDonald's for three minutes and lectures me about wasting money, which is rich considering she was at the grocery store for four hours yesterday and came back with just milk saying nothing good on sale. Dad checks the app and ask her four hours at one store and mom glares at me like I should have warned her he was checking, but how can I when she's watching my every move? She Used to text me to cover for her. Now she can't without dad seeing our messages about her lies. Week three, she's at a medical plaza until eleven PM Dad mentions, that's your fourth appointment this week. You okay? She snaps, Women's Health is very thorough, but I've been to that clinic. They close at 6 that night. Dad asks me privately, does your mom seem sick to you? I pull up her location history, all those medical building visits, and we're both hoping it isn't true. However, the electric Bill arrives marked Final Notice, and dad slams it on the counter so hard the salt shaker falls over. I gave you $400 for that. And mom says, processing delay. It's fine. Dad and I are both staring at her location pins on the map. Week 5 and dad texts me, I'm leaving work early. Something's not right. Meet me at the Medical Plaza. We both see Mom's been there since 11:00am and it's now six PM I tell my manager I'm sick and drive over. Dad's already there in the parking lot looking at life. 3, 60 zoomed in.

The principal stops reading my college rejection letter, my third one this week, and looks up at me. Your GPA is excellent, she reads, frowning at her screen. But it says here you have zero extracurriculars. I explained to her that I stay after school every day to help other students, but the principal frowns, saying, the activities log shows you've never joined a single club or done even an hour of community service. I tell her I'm literally in room 2:03 until 6:30 p m. Every day, sometimes until 9 during playoffs. Just ask Mister Hayes. She pulls up security footage on her computer, and there I am in room 2:03 with five varsity football players, including our state champion quarterback, writing five different essays while they're on their phones. The principal's face goes white as she asks me, you're doing their homework? I'm confused. I explained to her that Mister Hayes says it's pure tutoring for my college application, but she types something into her laptop and turns the screen toward me, saying, there's no record of any tutoring program in our system. My mouth goes dry, and I feel my stomach drop through the floor because I've been doing this for three years, every single day after school, all while Mister Hayes told me Harvard loves students who help athletes succeed. However, I can only assume Harvard doesn't love students who do athletes homework for Them. The principal calls in the guidance counselor, who pulls my record, saying, you've missed every college prep meeting. I explained that Mister Hayes said the tutoring was more important. The counselor's fingers freeze over the keyboard. The counselor asks, did you write your own college essays yet? And I tell them that I started them, but Mister Hayes said they needed editing. He asked me if he edited them, and I admit no. He said I should focus on helping the team first. The counselor's face goes pale, and she grips the edge of the desk as she says, you missed your own deadline, helping others meet theirs. But I defend him, my voice getting smaller, saying, Mister Hayes says the team brings in thousands of dollars to the school, and my grades are good enough as is. I should help those who have a lower chance of success. The principal shakes her head, and something in her eyes makes my chest tight as she says, your grades are excellent, but colleges rejected you because you're a ghost with no activities, no personality, no recommendations that aren't about how helpful you are to others, just grades. When it hits me like a punch to the stomach, I realized I spent so much time writing everyone else's story, I forgot to write my own. Mr. Hayes freezes in the doorway when he sees us, his coffee cup halfway to his lips, and he tries to turn around and leave, but The principal calls him in. Ask

So I made sure he found out on Father's Day that he was right. When mom married Eric, I was 8 years old and desperate for a father figure. My biological dad had walked out when I was three, leaving behind only a box of photos and unpaid child support. Garrett seemed perfect at first. He fixed our broken faucet, taught me to ride a bike, and never missed my school plays. But everything changed when my half brother, Colton was born. Suddenly, I became the unwanted stepchild. Garrett would buy Colton expensive toys while telling me my allowance was earned, not given. At family dinners, he'd brag about Colton's first steps while dismissing my honorable achievements. When relatives visited, he'd introduce Colton as my son and me as my wife's daughter. The worst part was how he'd punish me for things Colton did. When Colton broke the living room lamp, I was grounded for not watching him properly. When he drew on the walls, I lost my art supplies for setting a bad example. Mom never intervened. She was so grateful to have a husband again that she pretended not to notice the favoritism. By high school, I'd accepted my role as the family scapegoat. I worked part time jobs to pay for my own clothes and saved every penny for college. Garrett made it clear I wouldn't receive help with tuition. That money was reserved for Colton's Future. Everything changed during my senior year when I needed medical records for a scholarship application. While searching through Mom's filing cabinet, I found my birth certificate. Under father, it listed someone named Pierce Buchanan, not unknown like I'd always been told. Pierce Buchanan wasn't some deadbeat who'd abandoned us. A quick internet search revealed he was a successful architect living two hours away. His company website showed a man with my exact nose and stubborn cowlick. I found his phone number and called, hands shaking first you can and speaking. Hi, I managed. This might sound crazy, but I think you're my father. My name is. Oh, my god! He interrupted. I've been looking for you for 15 years. We met the following weekend at a coffee shop. Pierce explained how mom had vanished while he was deployed overseas with the National Guard. When he returned, she'd moved and changed her phone number. He'd hired investigators, but she'd covered her tracks well. I never stopped looking, showing me a folder filled with investigator reports. I've been paying child support to a state account this whole time, hoping it would reach you somehow. Those unpaid child support checks. Mom and Garrett had been collecting them for years. Pierce was nothing like the deadbeat mom had described. He was kind, successful, and genuinely interested in my life. He'd saved every penny of child support in a college fund, enough to cover four years at any university I chose. For months, I Kept our relationship secret. While planning my revenge, Pierce helped me gather evidence of the diverted child support. We documented every payment, every forged signature, every lie. Father's Day arrived, and Garrett expected his usual Celebration. Colton had made him a clay mug.

My dad's first holiday with full custody almost became my last. I was reaching for the mashed potatoes when the pain hit, like someone was twisting a knife in my lower right side. Dad, I whispered, gripping the table, my stomach really hurts. Not now, Mason, he said, not even looking at me. We're about to do the family toast. was our first Thanksgiving at Grandma Fiona's house in three years. The first one since dad won partial custody. The first one without mom. I want to make a toast. Grandma Fiona began, raising her wine glass. To having our family back together, away from certain negative influences. Everyone knew she meant mom. The pain was getting worse. I pressed my hand against my side and felt heat radiating through my shirt. Dad, I tried again. I think something's wrong. Mason's trying to ruin dinner, my cousin sinaun announced. Just like last time. Last time? When I was 8 and threw up at Easter because mom had just told me about the divorce. They still hadn't forgiven me for making a scene. Not trying to. A wave of nausea hit me so hard I doubled over. Oh, here we go, Aunt Linda sighed. Fiona, didn't I tell you? The mother probably coached him to do this. My mom's not even here! I protested, and immediately regretted raising my voice as another stab of pain shot through me. Watch your tone, Dad warned. Your mother's not here because she lost that privilege, and you're not going to manipulate your way out of family time. I stood up, planning to go to the bathroom, but the room tilted. I grabbed the chair to steady myself. Sit down, Grandma Fiona's voice was ice. We do not leave the table during the family toast. It's disrespectful. I think I'm going to throw up. Of course you are, Uncle Robert laughed. Just like your mother. Always so dramatic, always the victim. My ten year old sister, Alice looked at me with worried eyes from across the table. She'd been silent since we arrived in, intimidated by Dad's family. Please, I whispered. I need to lie down. You need to show respect, dad said firmly. This is the first holiday we've had without your mother's interference. You're not ruining it. The pain was spreading now like fire across my abdomen. I could feel sweat dripping down my back. Maybe he really is sick, my cousin Bethany said quietly. Don't you start, her mother snapped. He's fine. Just wants attention because Mommy's not here to baby him. I tried to sit back down, but my legs wouldn't cooperate. The chair scraped loudly against the floor as I missed it and stumbled. Mason James! Dad stood up. That's enough, dad, please. Tears were streaming down my face now. It hurts so bad. You know what hurts? Grandma Fiona stood, too. Having to watch my son deal with your Behavior. Having to see what that woman turned you into. Alice suddenly pushed back her chair. He's not faking, she screamed. Look at him. He's white. Alice, sit down, dad ordered. No! She was sobbing now. Mom said if we ever needed help to call 9 1 1. She said you wouldn't listen, she said. Your mother said a lot of things. Aunt Linda interrupted, most of them lies. The room started spinning. I dropped to my knees, clutching my side. It felt like my insides were on fire. He's being ridiculous. Uncle Robert said, in my day, kids didn't pull these stunts. It's not a stunt. Alice was hysterical. Please, someone help him! I'm calling his mother, Aunt Linda.

I have two kids. My daughter Anya is 17 and my stepson Noah is 14. Noah's mom died a few years back and he's been living with me full time since. He's not like some weird loner kid or anything, but he really doesn't like when people mess with his stuff or invade his space. When he gets really overwhelmed, he just kind of shuts down completely and won't talk to anyone for a while. Anya's the total opposite. She's super outgoing, always has friends over, constantly on her phone with someone. Last Thursday, she asked if she could have 4 friends sleep over on Saturday night. I said, yeah, sure, but I gave her two rules. First, her friends needed to stay out of Noah's room completely. They're kind of loud and in the past they've crowded him and made him uncomfortable. Second, keep the noise down after 11 so the rest of us could actually sleep. That's it. Two basic rules that any normal person should be able to follow. Saturday comes around and her friends show up around six, they're making dinner, blasting music, laughing super loud in the kitchen. Totally fine. I was downstairs watching TV and honestly wasn't paying much attention. I figured they were 17 years old. I didn't need to babysit them every five minutes. Around 10, I decided to go upstairs and just do a quick check to make sure everything was cool before I went to bed. I walk past Anya's room and it's empty. Weird. I hear voices coming from down the hall and my stomach just drops because I immediately know where they are. I open Noah's door and all five of them are in there. Two of the girls are literally sitting on his bed like they own the place. One of them has his sketchbook open and is flipping through it while the others are giggling. Another girl is going through the stuff on his desk, picking up his headphones and looking at his drawings pinned to the wall. They're all laughing in this way that made my skin crawl, like they thought the whole thing was hilarious. Noah was sitting on the floor in the corner near his closet. He wasn't saying anything. He wasn't moving, but I could see tears in his eyes and his hands were shaking a little. I said his name twice and he didn't even look at me. That's when I knew he'd completely shut down. I told all the girls to get out of the room right now. Anya started to say something, but I cut her off and told her I was calling all of their parents immediately. He looked at me like I just told her I was burning her phone. One of her friends tried to laugh it off and said they were just talking to him, but I didn't care. I pointed at the door and told them To go downstairs and wait in the living room. Tanya followed me out into the hallway and started saying I was being ridiculous and embarrassing her in front of her friends. I told her I gave her two rules and she couldn't even follow one of them. She said they were just trying to include Noah and be nice. I asked her if he looked included to her. She didn't have an answer for that. I went back into Noah's room and sat on the floor next to him. I didn't try to make him talk or anything. I just.

My daughter's 4th grade teacher told her class that blood is blue inside your body and only turns red when it hits oxygen. Lily came home repeating this fact while showing me her veins. I gently explained that's actually not true. Blood is always red because of hemoglobin, just it's darker red in veins. She looked at me confused, but Missus Wilson showed us a whole Powerpoint about it. Dad. She even had diagrams from a science book. Next morning I packed my work scrubs in my bag. I'm an er nurse at Mercy General and I was working the three PM shift. Anyway, I sent Missus Wilson an email asking if I could do a quick 15 minute presentation about blood for Career Day that afternoon. She loved the idea. When I arrived, Missus Wilson introduced me as Lily's dad who works at the hospital. Twenty eight kids stared up at me from their desks covered in Lisa Frank folders and Minecraft pencil cases. I heard you guys Learned that blood is blue inside your body, I said. The entire class nodded enthusiastically. Missus Wilson beamed from her desk. I pulled out a vacutainer blood collection tube from my pocket. This is what we use to draw blood at the hospital. Notice something, I held it up. The tube creates a vacuum. No oxygen inside at all. Missus Wilson smile started fading as I explained when We draw blood with these. It never touches oxygen until we pop the cap off. But I showed photos on my phone of sealed blood tubes still red. The kids were fascinated. I showed them medical textbook pages on my tablet. Missus Wilson kept clearing her throat, her face getting redder than the blood samples on my screen. But our textbook says it's blue, one boy argued, pointing to their science book. I walked over and check the publication date, 1998. Medicine updates pretty fast, I explained. We used to think lots of things that turned out to be wrong. Missus Wilson suddenly stood up. Well, thank you for that interesting presentation.

When she claimed he was too drunk to see his daughter, her lawyer's confident smirk started melting. Then came the kicker. He pulled out his phone and here's security footage from my apartment building. The video was crystal clear. Time stamp showed 2:00am, three days before the hearing. There was his ex wife. You. Using a spare key to enter his apartment. She had a grocery bag full of beer bottles, the exact same brands from her photos, placing them strategically around the living room, even staging one near a children's book. The courtroom went dead silent. Her lawyer started shoving papers into his briefcase like the building was on fire. But he wasn't done. Second video showed her coaching their daughter in the parking lot after visitation. Remember, tell Mommy if daddy's house smells like the yucky stuff. Can you say daddy was sleeping when you needed him? Practice your sad face. The little girl nodding innocently, not understanding she was being weaponized. Judge's face went from sympathetic to furious in seconds. Custody awarded to father effective immediately. Supervised visitation only for mother pending psychological evaluation. Three months later, she lost visitation rights entirely when two more recording surfaced. One of her calling his workplace, pretending to be a concerned citizen, reporting him drunk. Another of her paying the elderly neighbor $200 and a script to memorize. The neighbor felt so guilty after seeing the little Girl crying that she confessed everything. The ex wife got charged with perjury, filing false reports, witness tampering and harassment. Dad got full custody back, child support and legal fees covered. Her lawyer dropped her and reported her to the state bar for fraud. Last I heard, that little girl's thriving with her father. She's in soccer now, on a roll at school and lights up whenever someone mentions her daddy. He brings her to court sometimes for routine paperwork and she always waves at me from across the lobby. Some victories just hit different when you see justice served to someone who truly deserves it.

Court clerk for eight years. This divorced dad was fighting for custody of his six year old daughter. His ex wife claimed he was an alcoholic who endangered their kid. She came prepared for war, had photos of beer bottles scattered around his house, testimony from three neighbours about loud parties and even a police report about a disturbance at his address. Her lawyer was this slick eye in a three thousand dollar suit who'd clearly done his homework. The evidence looked damning. Photos showed empty bottles everywhere, kitchen counter, coffee table, bathroom sink, even one in the kids toy box next to her stuffed bunny. The neighbours swore they'd seen him stumbling around drunk at two PM on weekdays, music blasting at all hours. One elderly neighbour claimed she'd called C P. S twice because the little girl looked neglected and scared. Her lawyer painted him as a complete deadbeat, said he missed scheduled visitations because he was too drunk to drive. Claimed the daughter came home crying, talking about daddy's angry voice, how the house smelled like yucky medicine. The guy sat there quietly throughout the whole character assassination. No fancy suit, just wrinkled khakis and a polo shirt, clutching a Manila folder like his life depended on it. I've seen plenty of custody battles and this one looked over before it started. The judge was taking detailed notes, nodding along with the ex wife's testimony. She Was crying at all the right moments, playing the devastated mother perfectly. Even I was starting to feel sorry for her. Judge looked ready to rule against him. When he finally asked to speak, his voice was shaky. Nervous. Your honor, when exactly did she say I missed those visits? October 15th, 22nd and 29th. The ex wife replied confidently, having her eyes with a tissue. He opened his folder with trembling hands. Here's my work schedule from the fire station. I'm a paramedic. I was saving lives. Those exact dates, 24 hour shifts, two car accidents and a heart attack on the 15th. Apartment fire on the 22nd, three car pile up on the 29th. The paperwork was official.

Dad glanced at me over his newspaper and gave a single nod. That was it. My brother didn't even acknowledge me. My sister took another selfie. No card on my plate, no small wrapped gift, not even a birthday candle and a pancake, nothing. I ate my breakfast in silence, watching my family completely ignore the fact that I existed. And honestly, I felt nothing, no sadness, no anger, just calm clarity. After breakfast, I cleared my throat. I have something to show you all. My dad lowered his newspaper, slightly annoyed at the interruption. Mom turned around from the dishes. My siblings finally looked up from their phones. I pulled out my laptop and opened it on the kitchen table. The MIT acceptance letter was already on the screen, big and bold and undeniable. I got into MIT, I said calmly. Full academic scholarship covers everything, tuition, room, board, books. Email came through three months ago. The silence that followed was deafening. Dad's newspaper slipped from his hands onto the table. Mom dropped a dish into the sink with a loud clatter. My brother's mouth literally fell open. My sister just stared. Three months, dad finally said, his voice barely a whisper. You got into MIT three months ago and you didn't tell us? I looked him straight in the eye. I figured you wouldn't care much. Money is tight, right? You know how it is. I Watched his face go from pale to red. Mom started crying, covering her mouth with soapy hands. That's not fair, my brother said. Finding his voice, we would have celebrated. We would have, would have what? I cut him off. Noticed me for once. Put down your phone. Actually remembered it was my birthday without me having to remind you. My sister looked down at her lap, tears starting to stream down her face. I'm moving out next week. I can continued my voice steady. I've already found an apartment near campus with two other incoming freshmen. Paid first and last month's rent with money I saved from the grocery store. My bags are half packed upstairs. Dad tried to stand up, but his legs seemed to give out. He sat back down heavily. Son, we can talk about this. We can. There's nothing to talk about, I said, closing my laptop. I just wanted you to know that the kid you ignored, the one who wasn't worth a birthday, is going to MIT. Thought you should hear it from me. Before I disappeared, I stood up and walked toward the stairs. Behind me, I heard mom sobbing openly. Now I heard my sister whisper to my brother, we really messed up. We really, really messed up. Yeah, they did. As I reached my bedroom door, I heard dad call out my name. His voice cracked, but I didn't turn around. I had spent 18 years waiting for them to See me now. I was done waiting.

I didn't have the heart to correct them when they're all so genuinely grateful. Her best friend Sarah pulled me aside and whispered, I don't know what magic you worked, but Emma's been like a completely different person. She actually laughs at our jokes now instead of just forcing smiles. The breaking point came when Emma finally got promoted to shift supervisor after months of anxiety about applying for the position. She wanted to celebrate at some fancy Italian restaurant downtown that she'd been saving up for. I honestly couldn't have done this without our Tuesday tradition, she said, tears streaming down her face. You've been my anchor when everything felt completely impossible. You showed me that I deserve good things happening to me randomly. I don't know how to properly thank you for saving my life. I realized I wasn't just bringing coffee anymore. I was accidentally someone's primary emotional support system and the foundation of their mental health recovery. Emma's therapist had apparently told her that having consistent, positive social interactions was absolutely crucial for her healing process. And somehow I'd become that irreplaceable person in her life. Now I'm four months deep into being someone's weekly lifeline because I couldn't handle 30 seconds of social awkwardness at a coffee counter like a normal human being. Emma just texted me a three paragraph Essay about how excited she is for me to meet her parents this weekend. They're flying in from Cincinnati specifically to meet the Coffee Angel who changed their daughter's life completely and helped her find herself again after losing hope. Her dad, Richard, apparently wants to take me golfing on Sunday morning to properly thank the young man who brought our Emma back to us when we thought we'd lost her forever. Her mom has been cooking my favorite meal all week, except Emma made up what my favorite food was because she was too embarrassed to admit she didn't actually know me that well. I'm completely trapped in being someone's accidental hero over a misheard you too that spiraled into becoming the most important person in a stranger's mental health journey and recovery process. The worst part, I actually look forward to Tuesdays now, too. And I think I'm falling for someone who's in love with a version of me that doesn't really exist.

But I turn the tables with a surprise of my own. His reaction is priceless. I was turning 18 and honestly, I wasn't expecting much. My brother got a car for his 18th birthday. Not just any car. A brand new Jeep with a bow on top. My sister got a trip to Paris with two of her friends when she turned eighteen. Me dad pulled me aside exactly one week before my birthday and said, don't expect anything special this year. Money is tight. You know how it is. But I knew exactly how it was. Money wasn't tight. It was never tight when it came to them. Growing up, I always felt invisible in my own house. My brother was the golden child. Star quarterback, straight A's. Everyone's favorite. My sister was the baby, the princess who could do no wrong. And me? I was just there, taking up space. I remember being 12 and winning a regional science fair. I came home so excited to tell everyone my brother had just scored a touchdown at practice same day. Guess which one got celebrated at dinner? Hint it wasn't the science fair. When I was 15, I made honor roll for the first time. I left the certificate on the kitchen counter, hoping someone would notice. Three days later, I found it under a pile of my sister's cheerleading flyers. No! No one Had said a word. So when dad gave me that warning about my birthday, something inside me shifted. I wasn't hurt anymore. I was done. I've been working at a local grocery store since I was 16. Every paycheck, I put away as much as I could. I told my parents the money was for college expenses, which wasn't exactly a lie. But I had a bigger plan brewing. Six months before my 18th birthday, I'd applied to MIT. I didn't tell anyone. Not my guidance counselor, not my friends, definitely not my family. I wrote the essays late at night in my room. I sent in my test scores, my transcripts. Everything in secret. Three months before my birthday, I got the email. Full academic scholarship. Full ride. They wanted me. I stared at that accepted letter for hours, reading it over and over, making sure it was real. And then I saved it. I didn't tell a soul. I wanted to wait for the perfect moment. My birthday morning arrived. I came downstairs around 9:00am. Mom was making pancakes, but they were my sister's favorite kind. Chocolate chip. My birthday breakfast had always been blueberry, but I guess she forgot. Dad was reading the newspaper. My brother was texting someone, probably his girlfriend. My sister was taking selfies with the pancakes before she even ate them. Morning, I said, sitting down at the table.

I replied, I understand. What she didn't know was that I've been planning to propose next week. The ring was already hidden in my sock drawer, a vintage emerald cut that cost me three months salary. I talked to her dad over beers at his favorite sports bar, booked our anniversary restaurant for Valentine's Day, even practiced the speech in my car during lunch breaks like a complete idiot. But when Lisa sat me down that Tuesday night, her face all serious and uncomfortable, talking about needing space to grow as individuals and finding ourselves, I just nodded calmly. Take all the time you need, I said. Watching her fidget nervously with that silver bracelet I bought her last Christmas. She looked genuinely confused by how calm I was staying. Probably expected me to bed egg, cry, make some desperate emotional speech about our four years together and all our future plans. Instead, I helped her pack her overnight bag, even folded her clothes neatly. The whole time she kept glancing at me like she was waiting for me to break down. The next morning, first thing, I walked straight into the jewelry store downtown and returned the ring, $2,000 back in my account just like that. The jeweler looked sympathetic but didn't ask questions. Then I did something completely insane. I bought a one way ticket to Tokyo, leaving in 10 days. I'd always dreamed of Teaching English in Japan since college. But Lisa absolutely hated the idea whenever I brought it up, called it running away from real adult responsibility and said I was being childish and unrealistic. We had our whole life mapped out. House in the suburbs, two kids, white picket fence. The worst, two weeks later, I was standing in Shibuya crossing with one suitcase and absolutely terrible. Japanese. Found a tiny teaching job at a conversation school in Akihabara, rented a shoebox apartment with paper thin walls, started learning the language from complete scratch using phone apps and YouTube videos.

I, 29, ma'am, was washing dishes last Wednesday when my fiance, Kelsey, 27, dropped the most arrogant statement I'd ever heard. We were arguing about her spending one $200 on a designer bag when we were supposed to be saving for the wedding. She slammed her fresh manicure on the counter. You know what, Ethan? I could replace you in 24 hours. Literally. Guys are lined up waiting for me to be single. You should be grateful I even chose you. I stopped washing, turned off the water, dried my hands slowly. Prove it. She laughed. That mean girl. Laugh. What? You said 24 hours. Prove it. We're done. Clock starts now. I checked my phone. 7:23 p m. Wednesday. Her face went through confusion, amusement, anger, then smug confidence. You're bluffing. You can't even match your socks without me. I walked to the bedroom and started packing. She followed, listing reasons I'd fail. You don't know the Netflix password. Your mom likes me more. Good luck finding someone who looks like me. You're literally nothing without me. That last one made me pause. Not because it hurt, but because I realized she actually believed it. Three years fit in two suitcases and a backpack. As I was leaving, my phone buzzed. Adrian. Kelsey's best friend. The one she called untouchable because she only dated millionaires. Heard you're single. Kelsey's already posting. You okay me heading to Jerome's? Adrian, come to mine instead. We need to talk. Now. I showed up at 9 p m. She opened the door in sweats and a messy bun. Before you say anything, I need to tell you something I should have said two years ago. She showed me texts with Kelsey from 2022. My stomach dropped. Kelsey. Ethan's getting too comfortable thinking about monkey branching to that lawyer guy from Pilates. Adrian, that's messed up. Ethan's a good guy, Kelsey. Good. Doesn't pay for Mycanoe trips, babes, but he's stable until I find better. Already added myself as authorized user on his AMX. Lol. There were dozens more plans to upgrade me. Her active hinge profile, messages about backup guys. Why didn't you tell me? I asked. I tried. Kelsey threatened to ruin me if I said anything.

My roommate Vanessa had this thing where she'd accidentally walk around in a towel whenever my boyfriends came over. She claimed she forgot I was bringing someone home, but it happened way too often to be coincidence. When I started dating Jordan from my psychology class, everything was perfect. He was sweet, brought me coffee before our 8:00am lectures and actually listened when I talked about my dreams. I thought I'd finally found someone genuine until our study. The group moved to our apartment. Vanessa would bring Jordan energy drinks without asking, sit way too close during our sessions and always found excuses to touch his arm while explaining concepts he already understood perfectly. Your roommates really nice. Jordan mentioned one evening after Vanessa had spent 20 minutes helping him with material I'd already explained. I brushed it off because I trusted him. Big mistake. One night I came back from my evening shift at the campus bookstore and found them making out on our couch like teenagers. Jordan jumped up, his shirt half unbuttoned saying it just happened and he was confused about his feelings. Vanessa just shrugged and said, you snooze, you lose, babe. I packed Jordan stuff in a trash bag and threw it at him. When he tried to apologize, I slammed the door in his face. I moved out within a week. But 6 months later when I was dating Noah from the gym. Guess who showed up at our boxing class? Vanessa enrolled the same day. I brought Noah as my guest, claiming she'd always wanted to try combat sports. She spent the entire session asking Noah to check her form and invited him to be her sparring partner. I watched her lean into him during water breaks, laughing at everything he said, even his bad dad jokes that made me cringe. She's cool, Noah said afterward. Really down to earth. Two weeks later, I decided to surprise Noah with dinner at his apartment. I used my spare key and walked in to find Vanessa straddling him on his kitchen encounter, both of them half naked with takeout containers scattered everywhere. He said, you guys weren't even that serious. Vanessa laughed when I confronted her, not even bothering to get dressed. Plus, you're always at work anyway. After losing my third boyfriend to Vanessa's games, I realized playing nice wasn't working. She was a predator and I needed to think like one, too. I knew Vanessa's weakness. She was obsessed with social media influencers and always fell for guys.

So I stopped talking to everyone and they couldn't handle it. My grandfather was a psychologist who believed silence revealed character. Terminal cancer. Final experiment, sit in complete silence with him one hour weekly for 6 months. Win his 4.7 million dollar estate. Comfort in silence shows presence over performance, say from his hospice bed. While my relatives planned strategies, my cousins immediately started practicing meditation apps and silence retreats. My aunt hired a Buddhist monk. My uncle read 17 books on quiet. They treated it like Olympics training, posting their silence journey on social media. Meanwhile, they couldn't shut up about the money. I'm doing two hours of silence practice every morning. My cousin Melissa would brag at family dinners. Grandpa will see how dedicated I am. I've been volunteering at silent meditation retreats. My brother Jake would counter, I'm basically a professional at this. They were missing the point entirely. The first Saturday arrived, my aunt went first, sitting confidently across from Grandpa. She lasted nine minutes before asking if he needed water. Disqualified. My uncle made it 18 minutes before checking his phone. Disqualified. Melissa brought her meditation app and Tibetan singing bowl. Six minutes before the notification went off, disqualified. Jake started telling Grandpa about his silence techniques at the four minute Mark. Disqualified. One by one, they failed. Some talked, some fidgeted, some fell asleep. But they all broke the silence. Within 30 minutes and came my turn. I walked in, sat down and looked at him, really looked at him, not at a dying man, not at a bank account, just at my grandfather, who used to take me fishing when I was seven. We sat there 60 minutes. I cried silently around minute 40 when I noticed how much weight he'd lost. He cried around minute 50, remembering my grandmother who'd passed two years earlier. When the hour ended, he smiled and said, same time next week. I nodded. My family couldn't comprehend it. How did you do it? They demand. What's your secret? Are you on medication? Did you hypnotize yourself?

My sister Simone and I used to finish each other's sentences. We had that weird twin thing where we'd show up wearing the same colour without planning it. People thought it was cute. I thought we'd be close forever. We grew up at our grandparents place after our parents died in a crash when we were 7. Grandpa Roy raised us. He was the type who'd make pancakes every Sunday and let us stay up late watching old game shows. He always told us we were equals. When he turned 70, he sat us both down at the kitchen table and said, when I'm gone, you girls split everything 50. 50. That's final. I moved to Portland when I was 26, got married, had two kids. Life got busy. I called Grandpa twice a week, visited every few months. It wasn't perfect, but I tried. Simone stayed local. She lived 20 minutes from him and helped with groceries and doctor appointments. When Grandpa died last March, I flew in the next day. The funeral was small. Simone barely looked at me. I figured she was just grieving. Then came the will reading. The lawyer, this older guy named Mister Hoffman, opened the folder and started reading. House to Simone, savings to Simone, the pension he'd been collecting all Simone. I sat there like I'd been slapped. Wait, what about me? Hoffman looked uncomfortable. There's no provision for you in the current Will, which was updated 14 months ago. I turned to Simone. She wasn't even surprised. She was staring at her hands. This has to be a mistake, I said. Grandpa always said 50, 50. Simone finally looked up. Her voice was flat. He changed his mind. You weren't around. I was the one taking him to chemo appointments and cleaning his house and cooking his meals while you were busy in Portland. I called him all the time. I visited when I could. I have two little kids, Simone. Exactly. You chose them. I chose him. He rewarded loyalty. I felt sick. So you're just taking everything. We're twins. He raised us the same. She stood up. The will is legal. It's done. I couldn't believe it. This was my sister. We used to build pillow forts and share secrets and cry together when we missed our parents. Now she was looking at me like I was a stranger.

This was it, the final line. I didn't get angry. I didn't yell. I just looked up at this girl I thought I loved making a fool of me on another man's shoulders in front of thousands of people. And I smiled because I was done. I turned and walked away. The crowd parted like they could feel the energy coming off me. I didn't look back once. I walked out of that venue into the cool night air and felt nothing but relief. The taxi ride home was the best 45 minutes I had in months. My head was completely clear for the first time in ages. I got back to my apartment, my name on the lease, my furniture and shot the dead bolt. Then I packed every single thing she owned, used her expensive luggage, did it properly. By midnight, it was like she'd never lived there. Around 2:30 a. M, I heard them stumbling and laughing outside. Her key scraped the lock, then hit the dead bolt. Banging started. Leo, let me in. The door is stuck. I didn't move. Just watch them on the doorbell camera. Eric trying to shoulder the door like some tough guy and bouncing off like an idiot. Finally, she called my phone. Leo, what's wrong with the door? Nothing's wrong with it. It's locked. Well, unlock it. No. Silence. What do you mean no? I mean, you don't live here anymore, Maya, you Found someone way better so you can go live with him. Your bags are packed. Have a nice life. I could hear Eric yelling in the background. She started sputtering about how I was breaking up with her over a joke. You broke up with us when you lied to my face and brought him to the concert. I said the rest was just you confirming my decision in front of a few thousand people. I hung up and blocked both numbers. Eventually, they gave up and left. I watched them go on the camera dragging her luggage down the hallway. The next morning, I moved everything to the building's hallway and sent an anonymous text. Your things are in the hall. Six months later, I haven't heard from her since. Their relationship imploded within weeks. Turns out their whole dynamic was based on him being the exciting alternative to me. Once I was gone, they had nothing to rebel against. Maya had to move back with her parents without me funding her lifestyle. Eric became the local joke after getting knocked out defending his girl. I saw her recently working as a waitress. When I was on a date, she turned white and immediately left her shift.

My girlfriend Maya had this male best friend, Eric, who was always around, always touching her arm, always looking at her like she was his prize. Six months earlier, I'd laid it out clearly. Either put serious distance between you two, or we're done. She cried, promised he was just a friend. And for months, things seemed better. Then came the concert. I busted my ass to get expensive tickets to her favorite band. It was supposed to be our date night. We get through the gates, and the first person I see is Eric, standing there with this smug grin. What's he doing here? I asked, not hiding my irritation. Maya went defensive immediately. Oh, my god, Leo, don't start. He got a ticket from a friend. It's total coincidence. The look Eric gave me, that little victorious smirk, told me everything. This was no coincidence. This was a setup. She lied to me and broken the one promise I'd made. A deal breaker. But I paid for those tickets. I decided to just ignore them. Stupid plan. Because Maya and Eric had other ideas. They were all over each other the entire time. Whispering, laughing at inside jokes I wasn't part of. She was putting on a performance, and I Was the chump in the background? I wasn't her date. I was just the guy who drove her there.

I told hold her, suggesting we move to the side instead. She gave me a five second pout, then turned to Eric with that bright fake smile. Eric will do it. He's strong. Just like that, he's crouching down and she's climbing onto his shoulders. The crowd around us, a bunch of drunk kids, started cheering. She was loving it, playing to them, living her main character moment. And she looked down at me. Since Eric's a few inches taller, she was really looking down. She laughed this loud, ugly sound that cut right through me. See? She shouted, making sure everyone around could hear. You're taller. Way better than my boyfriend. The crowd roared their approval. Eric just stared at me with that same smug, punchable face. He'd won. That's when everything went quiet for me. The music, the crowd, everything just faded. It was this cold, hard.

The compensation was $800 plus a hotel voucher. This businessman in an expensive suit storms over and taps my shoulder. Hey, you should volunteer. I have a million dollar deal closing tomorrow. I politely told him I had an important interview and couldn't give up my seat. His face turned red. Do you know who I am? I fly first class every week. You look like you could use that $800 more than I need this hassle. I said no again and put my headphones back on. But he wouldn't let it go. He sits down right next to me. Listen, I'm trying to be nice here. That interview can be rescheduled. My deal can't. I told him he didn't know anything about my situation and asked him to leave me alone. He laughs and pulls out his phone. What company? I probably know the CEO. I. I can make one call and get you a better position. I ignored him completely and moved to a different seat across the gate area. He actually follows me and sits down again. You're making this harder than it needs to be. I'm offering to help you out here. Other passengers started noticing this guy literally following me around the gate area, starts talking loudly to anyone who listen. Can you believe this? I offered to compensate him personally. And he's being completely unreasonable. A woman with kids nearby asked him to keep it down because he was being, he turns to her and says, ma'am, I'm trying to solve a problem here. Then he goes back to the gate agent and I hear him say, that guy over there refuses to volunteer. Can't you just bump him instead? The gate agent explains that's not how it works and they need actual volunteer. He storms back over to me with this entitled smirk, fine. The gate agent suggested I negotiate directly with passengers. I told him the gate agent definitely didn't say that and he was lying. His voice gets even louder. I've been flying for 20 years and I've never met someone so stubborn. Now half the gate is watching this spectacle he's creating. He pulls out his business card and waves it around. I'm a senior partner at Donaldson and Associates. Look it up. Nobody cared about his business card, but he kept waving it anyway. Then he starts approaching other passengers, asking if they'll volunteer and pointing at me saying, he won't do it, so maybe you will. This college kid tells him, dude, leave him alone. You volunteer if it's so important. Snapped back, I'm in first class. They can't bump me. It has to be someone from economy. The college kid laughs and says, then deal with it like everyone else. He's getting more aggressive now, pacing around the gate area and complaining loudly. To anyone who'll make eye contact. Then he pulls out his wallet. Fine, I'll give you 1,000 cash right now. Just take the voucher, I told him.

Brad thought scaring people was hilarious, and his kids did, too. Every morning, his dogs attack a fence while his boys laughed at crying kindergartners. At the fourth of July barbecue, he let all three dogs loose while his kids timed the chaos. When our HOA tried discussing dog rules, Brad brought his meanest one, and nobody would speak up. His brother worked for animal control and made complaints disappear. Here. Things got worse after Brad realized nobody would stop him. He started training his dogs in the front yard while his boys kept score. They had a whole system where old people were worth one point, but runners were worth five. His wife Lauren, started taking the kids to her mother's house during training sessions. I tried asking him to keep the dogs in back during school hours. The next day, his older son stood at the bus stop with Rex. The chain was just short enough to not reach the sidewalk. Kids pressed against the opposite fence anyway. Brad filmed it from his porch while his younger boy counted how many kids cried. Whenever anyone complained, Brad would claim discrimination against pitbulls. He threatened to sue for harassment and mentioned his brother at animal control. he'd let his dogs accidentally get loose near the complainer's house. he started bringing raw meat to the park during Family picnics. His dogs would fight over it while his kids cheered at the farmers market. He'd act shocked when they lunged at other pets. Lauren stopped coming to neighborhood events after people begged her to intervene. My puppy Milo was everything Brad's dogs weren't. My mom gave him to me two weeks before she died of cancer. He was this gentle golden retriever who loved everyone. Brad kept saying I was raising a marshmallow, not a dog. That morning, I just let Milo out when I noticed Brad's kids by their back. The older boy was teaching the younger one something about the latch. I had a bad feeling and moved toward the door. Pull it fast and watch him work, the kid said. The gate flew open and Rex burst through like a missile. I screamed and ran, but knew I wouldn't make it. Rex hit Milo hard and went straight for his throat. Brad appeared on his deck holding his Sunday newspaper and coffee. His kids whooped and hollered while my puppy fought for his life. I pleaded with Brad to intervene. He checked his watch like he was timing it. The emergency vet couldn't save Milo. She said Rex had been trained for quick kills, not regular dog fights. The police claimed without video evidence, their hands were tied. Brad's response when I confronted him was that I'd Learned why people get real Protection dogs. His kids high fived him and went back inside. I buried Milo under his favorite tree and spent a week planning. Brad posted constantly about hunting trips and being an APEX predator. He thought fear was entertainment, but I'd show him what being prey felt like. I studied the woods behind our properties and found paths between the trees. Mrs. Chen

She seemed fine with it at the time. Yet here we were the night before my party, and she'd forgotten that crucial detail. I typed back, sorry, Ellen, no kids allowed. Remember what happened last year? My apartment still hasn't recovered. Her response appeared instantly. They were just being children. Besides, I already bought their costumes and told them they're going to Aunt Katie's spooky party. You wouldn't disappoint kids on Halloween, would you? That's just cruel. Actually, I would. And I wasn't about to let emotional manipulation ruin another Halloween. Instead of arguing further, I had a better idea. My neighbour Mike works as a professional clown for children's parties. But here's the thing about Mike. He's 6 4, covered in tattoos and has this naturally intense stare. Kids are terrified of him. Despite his best efforts to be friendly. I called Mike and explained my situation. He laughed and agreed to help for $200 and unlimited access to my Halloween punch. Next evening, as my adult guests began arriving, Mike took up his position on my front porch. He wore his standard clown costume, but with blood splatters added to his white makeup, and carried a sign that read adults only party. Children will be entertained by me on the porch. At exactly seven thirty PM, Ellen's minivan pulled into my driveway. I watched through the window as she parked and started unloading her vampire twins. Then she spotted Mike sitting eerily still on My porch swing. Slowly twisting a balloon animal while staring directly at her car. The look on her face was priceless. She frantically rolled up the car windows and locked the doors. The twins were pressing their faces against the glass, their vampire makeup now streaked with tears. Ellen reversed so quickly she knocked over my mailbox in her escape. My phone lit up with a furious text. What kind of sick joke is this? I simply replied, adults only means adults only. Enjoy your evening. The party was perfect. No broken heirlooms, no emergency vet visits, and not a single fish was harmed. Mike turned out to be the hit of the party. He makes incredible balloon martini glasses. Ellen hasn't spoken to me since, but several family members have thanked me privately. Apparently, I'm not the first victim of her kids will be kids parenting style.

What kind of vegetables taste this good? My wife and I are dying. Trying not to laugh, the nurse whispers, should I tell her? I shake my head frantically. Jade finishes the entire cup and asks for more. This magical vegetable juice is healing my soul. I can feel the plants giving me their energy. She drank three more cups before the anesthesia wore off. When she finally came to her senses, she looked at the empty cups and asked, what was that amazing broth? The nurse, trying to keep a straight face, said, it was, um, special healing broth. I knew it. I could taste the life force. Vegetables are so generous. We never told her the truth about her magical vegetable juice. But the real comedy came during her second chemo session. Jade was so nauseous she couldn't keep anything down. The hospital served her this sad piece, some grilled chicken. Jade stared at it for 10 minutes. Then she looked at me and whispered, dad, I think the chicken is judging me. Honey, it's dead. It can't judge you. But what if its spirit is watching? What if there's a chicken afterlife and I'm about to commit a hate crime? Finally, she picks up the fork, closes her eyes and takes a tiny bite. Then she opens her eyes wide and goes, oh, my god, what it tastes like that magical healing Broth from surgery. Why didn't anyone tell me this could taste this good? She devoured the entire piece in about 30 seconds, then immediately started crying. I'm a hypocrite. I'm carnivore. I'm everything I hate. The chickens will never forgive me. The nurse walked in during this breakdown and Jade grabbed her arm. I ate a chicken. I'm a monster. Do you think it had a family? The nurse, bless her heart, just patted Jade's hand and said, honey, that chicken lived its best life so you could live yours. Jade sobbed harder. That's the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me. Three months later, Jade's in remission. She's still mostly vegan, but now she eats what she calls medical meat twice a week. She convinced the animals are sacrificing themselves for her health. Last week, she was eating a Turkey sandwich and suddenly stopped mid bite. Thank you, Turkey. Your death was not in vain. Now she refers to me and my wife as her protein dealers and asks us to handle the dirty work. While she maintains plausible denial ability, she still doesn't know about the magical vegetable juice incident.

My cousin Ellen texted me last night at eleven PM, the kids are so excited to be vampires at your party tomorrow. I nearly dropped my phone. I never invited her kids, not after what happened last year. For context, I've hosted an elaborate Halloween party for the past five years. It's, I think I spent months planning the decorations, curating the perfect playlist and mixing signature cocktails. My friends look forward to it all year. Last October, Ellen called me crying because her babysitter cancelled. Last minute. Please, I haven't been out in months. The twins will behave, I promise. They're better now. Against my better judgement, I said yes. I mean, how bad could a couple of seven year olds be? Catastrophic. As it turns out, within 20 minutes of arriving, they were running laps around my apartment. Ellen just sipped her drink and chatted completely oblivious. The first disaster happened when they decided to play hot lava and jumped from my couch to my antique coffee table. The table, a 200 year old family heirloom my grandmother left me, collapsed under their weight. Ellen barely looked up. Kids will be kids, he shrugged. An hour later, I found them in my bedroom dumping out my makeup collection onto my white bed spread. We're doing monster makeup, they announced proudly, covered in my 50 dollar foundation while I was cleaning Up the makeup disaster. They somehow got into the Halloween candy I had set aside for trick or treaters. They not only devoured most of it, but also fed several chocolate bars to my dog, pepper. By midnight, pepper was violently ill. I had to leave my own party to rush her to the emergency vet. The Bill, $600. When I returned home at 3:00am, exhausted and worried about pepper, I discovered one of the twins had gotten sick and vomited directly into my fish tank. My surprise, Betta Fish, the one I'd raised from a tiny fry, was floating at the top the next morning. Ellen's response to all this destruction? They were overtired. You shouldn't have so many breakable things if you're going to invite children. I didn't invite children. She invited them. So this year I sent beautifully designed invitations with adults only written in bold Gothic lettering at the top. I even called Ellen specifically to.

You know white isn't the bridal color in Indian weddings, right? I froze. In all my panic about Kayla's manipulation tactics, I completely forgotten that crucial detail. Kayla had no idea Priya would be wearing a stunning red leheng with intricate gold embroidery. Wedding day arrives. I'm getting ready with my groomsmen when my cousin texts, dude, your sister just walked in looking like she thinks she's the bride. My stomach dropped until I remembered Priya's words. Then I actually started laughing. Kayla struts in wearing this elaborate white ball gown, strapless with a cathedral train, clearly custom made and expensive. She'd even hired a professional makeup artist and had her hair done in an elaborate updo with white flowers. The confused looks from Priya's family were absolutely priceless. Indian weddings are vibrant, colorful celebrations. And here's Kayla looking like she wandered in from a completely different century. During the ceremony, I kept glancing at Kayla. She looked increasingly uncomfortable as she realized everyone was staring at her for all the wrong reasons. Priya looked absolutely radiant in her traditional red and gold, surrounded by family and brilliant blues, greens and purples. While Kayla stood out like a sore thumb in stark white. But the absolute best part came during the reception. Priya's grandmother, this tiny eighty year old woman who'd flown in from Mumbai, walked straight up to Kayla. In her thick accent, she loudly asked, Zeta, why are you dressed for a funeral at a Wedding? Did someone die that we should know about? The entire hall went silent, then erupted in laughter. Kayla's face went bright red as she stammered some excuse use about western traditions. But nanny wasn't done. In my day, only widows wore white to celebrations. Are you mourning something, dear? Should we be concerned? More laughter rippled through the crowd. Even my parents were chuckling behind their hands. Kayla realized she looked completely ridiculous in white while the actual bride glowed in traditional colors, surrounded by guests in vibrant sorries and lahangas that made her look like a ghost at a rainbow party. She grabbed her purse and left early, muttering about cultural misunderstandings and disrespectful in laws. Meanwhile, everyone spent the rest of the night complimenting Priya's stunning outfit and asking about the beautiful traditions. For once, Kayla's desperate attempt to steal the spotlight completely backfired. Best wedding gift ever.

My 17 year old daughter, Jade, has been vegan for three years. And I mean aggressively vegan. She once broke up with a guy because he ate a cheeseburger on their date. She named our chickens so we couldn't eat eggs. Last month, Jade got diagnosed with leukemia. The oncologist, doctor Gabe, is this serious? No nonsense, guy. He sits us down and says very gravely, Jade needs to increase her protein intake immediately. Her body needs complete proteins to handle chemotherapy. Jade crosses her arms. I'm not eating animals. Find another way. Doctor Gabe blinks. Jade, this is life or death. You need at least eight. Eight grams of protein daily. Then I'll die with a clear conscience. The next week was like a sitcom from hell. My wife tried sneaking chicken broth into Jade's soup. Jade took one sip, spit it out, and yelled, mom, this tastes like blood! I attempted hiding ground Turkey in her spaghetti sauce. She took one bite, ran to the bathroom, and came back with a toothbrush. I need to scrub the death from my mouth. We brought in a nutritionist who suggested protein powder. Jade screamed, whey protein! That's cow juice powder! You're trying to turn me into a Dairy Vampire! By week two, Jade had lost eight pounds, and Doctor Gabe was getting desperate. He tried reasoning with her. Jade, even plants want to live. You're still ending life. Jade gasped dramatically. Did you just compare a carrot to a cow? A carrot doesn't have feelings, Doctor Gabe. How do you know? Because carrots don't have faces. Then my wife had this brilliant idea. She went to this fancy vegan restaurant and explained the situation. The chef created these protein shakes that looked like green smoothies but were packed with pea protein, hemp hearts, and spirulina. He drank them religiously, calling them her life force elixirs. Her protein levels shot up. But here's where it gets absolutely hilarious. Jade needed a minor surgery to insert her chemo port. When she woke up from anesthesia, she was completely loopy.

Growing up, my sister Kayla made everything about her. My birthday parties, she got gifts, too, because I wouldn't exist without her. Every graduation, every achievement hijacked. When I won the science fair in 8th grade, she convinced my parents to throw her a supportive sister party the same night. When I got into college, she announced her engagement at my Celebration dinner. When I graduated with honors, she showed up in a revealing red dress and spent the whole ceremony flirting with professors. The pattern never stopped. Kayla had this way of making herself the victim. Whenever I achieved anything, you're so lucky, she'd say. I sacrificed so much for you. Growing up. Meanwhile, I was the one babysitting her kids while she partied through her 20s. I was the one lending her money she never paid back. I was the one covering for her when she bailed on family obligations. When I got engaged to my Indian fiance, Priya, I was terrified Kayla would find a way to ruin it. Sure enough, at our engagement party, she immediately joked about wearing white to our wedding. It'll be so funny, she laughed, like in the movies, I'll be the mysterious woman in white. She even made this dramatic pose, hand on her forehead like some soap opera actress. I pulled her aside and told her, absolutely not. This is my one day. Kayla, please. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic, that it was just a joke. God, you're so sensitive. It's not like anyone would actually confuse me for the bride. But she seemed to agree to drop it. Two weeks later, I found out she'd gone behind my back and asked Priya directly. Your sister seems really excited about her dress choice. Priya mentioned casually over dinner, she kept asking about fabric and styles. My blood ran cold. I knew exactly what that meant. I freaked out on Priya. Explain and Kayla's entire history of stealing my moments. She did this at my high school graduation, wore this attention grabbing red dress and flirted with all the dads. At my college graduation, she announced her price. She'll definitely show up in some elaborate white gown designed to make everyone look at her instead of us. That night, I had a complete breakdown, sobbing, hyperventilating. 28 years of suppressed resentment came pouring out. I was convinced Priya would see my toxic family dynamics and run for the hills. Who wants to marry into that kind of drama? Instead, she held me and.

The chickens will never forgive me. The nurse walked in during this breakdown and Jade grabbed her arm. I ate a chicken. I'm a monster. Do you think it had a family? The nurse, bless her heart, just patted Jade's hand and said, honey, that chicken lived its best life so you could live yours. Jade sobbed harder. That's the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me. Three months later, Jade's in remission. She's still mostly vegan, but now she eats what she calls medical meat twice a week. She convinced the animals are sacrificing themselves for her health. Last week, she was eating a Turkey sandwich and suddenly stopped mid bite. Thank you, Turkey. Your death was not in vain. Now she refers to me and my wife as her protein dealers and asks us to handle the dirty work. While she maintains plausible denial ability, she still doesn't know about the magical vegetable juice incident.

My 17 year old daughter Jade has been vegan for 3 years and I mean aggressively vegan. She once broke up with a guy because he ate a cheeseburger on their date. She named our chickens so we couldn't eat eggs. Last month, Jade got diagnosed with leukemia. The oncologist, doctor Gabe, is this serious no nonsense guy. He sits us down and says very gravely, Jade needs to increase her protein intake immediately. Her body needs complete proteins to handle chemotherapy. Jade crosses her arms. I'm not eating animals. Find another way, Doctor Gay blinks. Jade, this is life or death. You need at least eight e grams of protein daily. Then I'll die with a clear conscience. The next week was like a sitcom from hell. My wife tried sneaking chicken broth into Jade's soup. Jade took one sip, spit it out and yelled, mom, this tastes like blood. I attempted hiding ground Turkey in her spaghetti sauce. She took one bite, ran to the bathroom and came back with a toothbrush. I need to scrub the death from my mouth. We brought in a nutritionist who suggested protein powder. Jade screamed, way protein? That's cow juice powder. You're trying to turn me into a dairy vampire. By week two, Jade had lost eight pounds and Doctor Gabe was getting desperate. He tried reasoning with her. Jade, even plants want to live. You're still ending life. Jade gasped dramatically. Did you just compare a carrot to a cow? A carrot doesn't have feelings, Doctor Gabe, how do you know? Because carrots don't have faces. Then my wife had this brilliant idea. She went to this fancy vegan restaurant and explained the situation. The chef created these protein shakes that looked like green smoothies but were packed with he protein, hemp hearts and spirulina. He drank them religiously, calling them her life force elixirs. Her protein levels shot up. But here's where it gets absolutely hilarious. Jade needed a minor surgery to insert her chemo port. When she woke up from anesthesia, she was completely loopy. The nurse brought her some chicken broth to help with nausea. Still high as a.

I'll keep it brief. She promised just three simple questions. He leaned back, clearly amused. Go ahead. When exactly did you purchase that Mercedes? She asked. Three weeks before the storm, he answered proudly. Custom ordered from Germany, she nodded. And what was its purchase value? $94,000, he dated confidently, as our evidence shows. One last question, she said steadily. What was your insurance deductible on that vehicle? The businessman's face fell. I don't recall exactly. Missus Peterson turned and made her way back to her table. She opened her folder and withdrew a document which she handed to the judge. This is a copy of Mister Harrington's insurance claim filed the morning after the storm. She explained quietly. He listed the car's value at $38,000 and received full compensation minus his $500 deductible. The insurance company has confirmed this in writing. The silence in that courtroom was deafening. From her folder, she produced emails between the businessman and three tree removal companies, all dated the week before the storm. These weren't requests to remove her tree, but inquiry specifically about insurance coverage for storm damage. The businessman started the protest, but Mrs. Peterson had saved her most damning evidence for last, presented security footage from the businessman's own camera showing him dragging additional branches onto his already damaged Mercedes the morning after the storm. This footage is time stamped 6:00am, approximately four hours after the tree fell. She explained, my grandson works in Digital security and helped me request these records legally. Judge Reynolds reviewed everything. In silence, the businessman and his attorneys whispered frantically among themselves. Finally, the judge looked up. Case dismissed, he announced firmly. Furthermore, I'm referring this matter to the district attorney for investigation of potential insurance fraud. As the businessman stormed out, Mrs. Peterson gathered her folder in Kane. I helped her down the courthouse steps afterward and she told me she'd lived next to that horrible man for 12 years. Sometimes, she said with a small smile, people think being old means being helpless. That's their mistake. I later heard the businessman faced insurance fraud charges and was ordered to pay Missus Peterson's legal costs. The elderly woman walked away with her dignity intact and a story that taught everyone in that courtroom a powerful lesson about underestimating people.

She seemed fine with it at the time. Yet here we were the night before my party, and she'd forgotten that crucial detail. I typed back, sorry, Ellen, no kids allowed. Remember what happened last year? My apartment still hasn't recovered. Her response appeared instantly. They were just being children. Besides, I already bought their costumes and told them they're going to Aunt Katie's spooky party. You wouldn't disappoint kids on Halloween, would you? That's just cruel. Actually, I would. And I wasn't about to let emotional manipulation ruin another Halloween. Instead of arguing further, I had a better idea. My neighbour Mike works as a professional clown for children's parties. But here's the thing about Mike. He's 6 4, covered in tattoos and has this naturally intense stare. Kids are terrified of him. Despite his best efforts to be friendly. I called Mike and explained my situation. He laughed and agreed to help for $200 and unlimited access to my Halloween punch. Next evening, as my adult guests began arriving, Mike took up his position on my front porch. He wore his standard clown costume, but with blood splatters added to his white makeup, and carried a sign that read adults only party. Children will be entertained by me on the porch. At exactly seven thirty PM, Ellen's minivan pulled into my driveway. I watched through the window as she parked and started unloading her vampire twins. Then she spotted Mike sitting eerily still on My porch swing. Slowly twisting a balloon animal while staring directly at her car. The look on her face was priceless. She frantically rolled up the car windows and locked the doors. The twins were pressing their faces against the glass, their vampire makeup now streaked with tears. Ellen reversed so quickly she knocked over my mailbox in her escape. My phone lit up with a furious text. What kind of sick joke is this? I simply replied, adults only means adults only. Enjoy your evening. The party was perfect. No broken heirlooms, no emergency vet visits, and not a single fish was harmed. Mike turned out to be the hit of the party. He makes incredible balloon martini glasses. Ellen hasn't spoken to me since, but several family members have thanked me privately. Apparently, I'm not the first victim of her kids will be kids parenting style.

I was a bailiff for 15 years and saw one that still gives me chills. This wealthy businessman sued his elderly neighbour for property damage after her oak tree fell during a storm, crushing his Mercedes. He walked in like he owned the courthouse, tailored suit, gold watch flashing under the lights, flanked by two attorneys carrying matching leather briefcases. Kind of legal team you assemble when you're not just trying to win but trying to bulldoze someone. Mrs. Peterson, the defendant, shuffled in alone, 76 years old, barely 5 feet tall with thinning white hair and hands gnarled from arthritis. All she carried was a weathered Manila folder and the wooden cane she needed to walk. Judge Reynolds called the court to order and the businessman's attorney launched into their presentation. It seemed airtight. Your honor, our evidence clearly demonstrates Missus Peterson's negligence. The attorney began displaying photographs of the destroyed Mercedes. The damage was extensive. The massive oak had completely flattened the luxury car's roof. They called an arborist to testify. The tree was obviously diseased and structurally compromised for years. He pointed to cross sections showing internal decay. Any responsible property owner would have addressed this hazard long ago. The plaintiff's team presented maintenance estimates totaling 167,000, $84,000 for the total loss Mercedes, $43,000 for damage to a decorative stone wall and $30,000 for emotional distress. When the businessman took a stand, he spoke with the Confidence of someone unaccustomed to being questioned. I warned Mrs. Peterson about that hazardous tree at least five times, he testified. I even offered to split the cost of removal, but she refused. Now she claims she can't afford to pay for her negligence. But that's not my problem. Throughout this entire presentation, Missus Peterson said nothing. She just sat quietly, occasionally taking careful notes with shaking hands. I remember thinking how hopeless her situation looked. No lawyer, no expert witnesses, just an elderly woman against a legal steamroller. When her turn came, she slowly rose to her feet, leaning on her cane. The businessman smirked as she shuffled toward the witness stand. The courtroom was silent. Everyone expected a rambling plea for mercy. But Missus Peterson surprised us all. Her voice was soft but clear as she asked if she could question the plaintiff, if directly.

The call came through my commanding officer. Your son committed felony assault at his father's wedding. You need to get home now. I was on a base in Germany and hadn't seen my boys in 8 months. Now my teenage son who stopped wrestling because he hated hurting people was facing charges for brutalizing a woman at the altar. After an 18 hour emergency flight, I, I headed to my ex husband's house where my son was. The wife's dark blood was still stained by the driveway. I rang the doorbell. My ex husband Conrad answered. His face twisted with rage. We're pressing charges. I'm not taking anyone's side until I see both, I said. Pushing past him. The living room was a tribunal. Conrad's parents on the couch, his brother Potter by the fireplace, his sister Fenn in the corner, the bride's parents standing like guard dogs. And in the center, the bride Lauren with a splinted nose, two black eyes, bandages across her face. She, she was crying, dabbing her eyes carefully around the swelling. And there surrounded by this mob sat my son, my 14 year old who refused to kill insects because he could have been born an ant, who taught his little stepbrother origami. He sat perfectly straight, chin raised, looking me dead in the eyes with zero regret. He looked proud of what he Did your son destroyed our family, Conrad spat. Look what he did to her face. Lauren sobbed harder. He's an animal. They're trying him as an adult, right? Grandpa shook his head in disgust. I to my son. His knuckles were still bruised and swollen. There seemed to be no real excuse. But then I asked for his side of the story. He looked around the room slowly taking in every face. Then he spoke. Voice clear. You wanna know the truth? She's been molesting me for six months. That's why I did it. My world stopped, but the room exploded instantly. Liar. Disgusting. How dare you. Lauren's face shifted for just a second before she wailed louder. He's making it up. I've been nothing but loving. Her mother stepped forward, pointing at my son. You evil little. But her father grabbed her arm, his face pale like he'd been expecting this. In the midst of all the chaos, my son pulled out his phone and swiped to his hidden photos, she said. Fourteen year old boys always want it said. I should be grateful. I saw the images over his shoulder and my stomach turned. Conrad's hands were shaking as he stared at the screen. Those could be anyone could have, but his voice was hollow like he was reading a script. He didn't believe Lauren tried to snatch the phone. Those are out of context. I, it was just she stopped realizing. She just admitted they were real. My son stood up, voice shaking with rage. Dad, I told you three months ago, you said she's just being affectionate. Conrad started stuttering. I didn't. I thought, Grandpa, you laughed. Lucky boy. Wish I had that problem at 14. Grandpa's face went from red to white. He looked at Lauren, then at his grandson, and something crumbled in his expression. Aunt Fenn, you told me, don't be dramatic. Fenn was backing toward the door, tears streaming. Oh, god. Oh, god. I thought you were just Uncle Potter. You said I should be grateful Potter had his head in his hands. Jesus Christ. I was joking. I didn't know she was actually grandma. You said boys can't be great by women. Grandma collapsed into the couch, rosary beads in her hands, whispering prayers. Every single one of you told me to shut up about it. Lauren's parents were having a whispered argument. Her father hissed. Not again, Patricia. You said she was better. The word again hung in the air. But that's not why I hit her. My son cut through. Everyone immediately froze. What do you.

My coach told me that they were not bringing me in for the next season. What he didn't mention was that I'd been his starting point guard for three years, team captain since junior year. My whole future depended on those three games. I even got my Jersey number tattooed on my shoulder. 23, the same number my dad wore when he played. But when Coach Miller called me into his office that Monday morning, he couldn't even look me in the eye. Just stared at his desk, shuffling the same papers over and over, clicking his pen repeatedly, like he always did when he was nervous. My nephew Keith, just transferred from Preston Prep. He needs stability right now. I just nodded quietly, even though my chest felt like it was caving in. Whatever's best for the team, I said. He seemed shocked I wasn't arguing. Probably expected me to beg, maybe cry, like Johnson did when he got cut last year. Instead, I cleaned out my locker in complete silence, folded my practice gear with the same precision I used for my pregame rituals. My Jersey hanging on the hook, the one with the captain's patch my mom had sewn on herself. Keith was already in the gym, wearing my number, running my plays, using my parking spot. That afternoon, I drove across town to our biggest rival school, hands shaking the whole way. Their star player had just torn his knee at a party trying to dunk on a lowered rim. Coach Thompson nearly fell over when I walked in. You serious? He asked, already reaching for transfer paperwork before I even finished explaining. Two days later, I was practicing with my new team, wearing No.. 5 because my number was already taken. Strange faces, different plays, but hungry eyes that reminded me why I loved basketball. First game in the new uniform, I played the best game of my life against the defending state champions. The same team that had destroyed us.

I'm in the middle of target looking for a throw pillow that matches absolutely nothing. And my phone rings. Caller ID says Lincoln Elementary. My stomach drop. I thought, oh, god, did she fall off the monkey bars again? Did she hit someone? Or worse, did she say some think she heard me say. So I answer all fake sweet, like, hi, this is her mom. And the lady on the other end says, ma'am, we need you to come in immediately. Your daughter had an incident. Now, listen, my daughter Layla is cute. Like, real cute. Big eyes, big hair, big attitude. She's eight, but she's also part gremlin when she's hungry or bored. So I throw the pillows back, leave the car, and speed down to that school like it's the Indie 500. I walk in, heart pounding, and the secretary just points at the principal's office like, yeah, she's in there. I open the door, and baby Layla sitting there with her arms crossed like a little mob boss. Principal looking nervous. There's a boy across from her with an ice pack on his head and a teacher looking like she aged 10 years today. I go, Layla, what did you do? She goes, he tried to take my cookie. So I defended myself, calm, like she's In court, the principal sighs and says, she hit him with a lunch tray. I blinked, I'm sorry. She what now? The teacher jumps in. She told the boy, touch it and you lose a finger. We thought she was joking. Next thing we know, he grabs her cookie, and boom! Metal tray to the forehead. I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing, because I know where she got that line. Me. She got it from me. I said that last week about my fries at Chili's. But I clear my throat and say, Layla, you can't go around hitting people. He goes, he tried to rob me. What was I supposed to do? Care like it's a fairy tale? That cookie had my name on it in Sharpie. I wrote it. Possession is nine tenths of the law, y'all. She hit him with legal terms. The boy starts sniffling like he's the victim here. And Layla leans in and says, you should have asked. Now look at you, iced up like leftovers. I had to turn around and pretend to cough so I wouldn't laugh. I'm dying inside. The principal says, we don't condone violence. Layla goes, neither do I, but I condone consequences. I swear, this child is either gonna be a lawyer or in jail. So I take her home, try to give her a serious talk. I go, he can't be violent even if you're right. There's rules. She goes, Exactly. Rule number one, don't touch my food. I said, Layla, I'm serious. She goes, okay, okay. Next time I'll use words. Maybe. Probably. And then y'all ready for the kicker? That night, I get a text from the mom of the boy. I'm bracing myself.

My family discovered I was good with kids when I was 14 and babysat my cousin once. That single afternoon of watching cartoons turned me into their unpaid nanny for the next 12 years. At first, it was just by my sister dropping off her toddler just for an hour while she ran errands. That hour turned into six when she decided to get her nails done instead. I remember sitting on my floor surrounded by broken crayons and goldfish crackers, realising I'd missed my shift at the coffee shop. My brother joined in with midnight text about his twins needing an emergency sitter for his concert plans. College, they took it even further. My sister would bang on my dorm door and dump her kids for entire weekends. She cost me my first serious boyfriend when she called me during our anniversary dinner screaming about a fake emergency. My boyfriend looked at me across that candlelit table and said he couldn't do this anymore. After graduation, my parents made everything worse by secretly giving my siblings keys to my apartment. I started coming home from my marketing job to find kids destroying my kitchen and toys taking over my home office. My boss pulled me aside after I'd missed another presentation and told me to figure out my priorities. The moment they took it too far came three months ago when I Woke up to voices in my living room. I stumbled out of my pajamas to find four kids watching cartoons with suitcases next to them. My sister's two kids and my brother's twins were all there eating my cereal like it was just another Saturday. On my counter was a note that made my hand shake. My entire family had booked a month long cruise to Europe and decided not to tell me because I'd make it difficult. Note said. They knew I take good care of the kids like I always do. I kept reading it over and over trying to understand how they could just leave the country without even asking me. My sister had attached a grocery list and my brother left $200 for expenses like I was their personal hired help. They could book without notice. The youngest kid looked up and asked if I was making pancakes for breakfast. An innocent question broke something inside me because these kids had no idea their parents had just abandoned them. That's when I decided to teach them what abandonment really felt like. You see, 12 years of forced babysitting had taught me every rule about child welfare and what authorities look for. I made the kids breakfast and told them we were going to play a game where they told me about all the times they'd stayed with me before. I recorded videos on my phone as they excitedly shared stories about being dropped off for days. Without their parents checking in, the seven year old even mentioned the time his mom left him here when he had strep throat. I carefully documented the suitcases, the note and the pathetic $200 meant to last a month. Then I looked up the number for Child Protective Services. My family thought they were getting a free month in Europe. Instead, they were about to learn what happens when you abandon your children with someone who knows the system. I called CPS and reported four abandoned minors with no guardianship papers. The case worker arrived within two hours and went pale reading the note. By afternoon, the kids were in emergency.

When I was 11, I started noticing this weird thing. Whenever someone lied to me, my tongue would tingle, like when you lick a battery. The first time it happened was at school when my friend Mia said she didn't take my pencil. My tongue buzzed like crazy, and later I found it in her desk. I thought it was just in my head, but it kept happening. In middle school, when kids said they didn't copy my homework. Buzz. When they claimed they weren't talking about me behind my back. Buzz. By eighth grade, I realised I had some kind of superpower. But it freaked me out. I stopped shaking hands with people because what if they were lying about something and I could taste it? I stopped eating at potluck because what if someone lied about washing their hands? My classmates already thought I was weird, so I never told anyone. But my gift made me unbeatable at group projects and friend drama. People thought I just had really good instincts about people. I didn't correct them. Then junior year happened and everything changed. My mom had been dating this guy, Trevor, for about six months. He was one of those smooth talkers who remembered everyone's birthday and always brought flowers. Mom was totally smitten. But every single time Trevor opened his mouth around me, my tongue went fuzzy. Not just a little tingle, but full on electric. Shock mode when he said he loved spending time with our family. Buzz when he complimented my mom's cooking. Buzz when he claimed he was just looking out for us. Buzz, Buzz, Buzz. The guy was a walking lie detector nightmare. I tried telling my mom about my bad vibes, but she brushed it off as teenage attitude. She said I was just protective and needed to give him a chance. But I knew something was wrong. One afternoon, I came home early from school and caught Trevor in my room. He was holding my tablet, scrolling through it like he owned the place. When he saw me, he didn't even look embarrassed. Hey, kiddo, just checking this for viruses, he said with that fake smile. Your mom asked me to make sure you're staying safe online. My tongue practically exploded. The buzzing was so intense, I could barely think straight. He was lying through his teeth. My mom would never ask you to do that, I said. He shrugged. She worries about you. You know how moms are. More buzzing. I grabbed my tablet from him and told my mom everything when she got home. But Trevor had already spun some story about me being disrespectful and trying to cause problems in their relationship. Mom took his side. That's when I decided to set a trap. I left my tap

I hired him at my construction company and watched him work for three months without him knowing I was her father. My daughter, Sophia, started dating this guy, Ethan, about eight months ago. Seemed like a decent kid. Said he was looking for work in construction since he'd moved to town. Sophia mentioned he had experience with roofing and electrical work. She kept asking if my company was hiring. I run a construction business with about 20 guys. We were looking for someone with his skills. But something made me wanna test this guy. Before mixing family with business, I told Sophia we weren't hiring. Then I had my form and post a job listing online. Ethan applied within two days. His resume looked good, five years experience, solid references, willing to start an entry level. I decided to interview him personally but never mentioned I was Sophia's dad. Just introduced myself as the owner. Ethan had no idea who I was. Sophia always called me dad around him. During the interview, Ethan seemed genuine, talked about wanting stable work, supporting his girlfriend through nursing school. He answered technical questions well. I hired him on the spot. For the first month, Ethan was exactly what you'd want. Showed up early, Ayed late, helped other guys with projects, never complained about hard jobs. The crew liked him. He was respectful to everyone. But I noticed he treated some people differently when he thought I wasn't around. I started paying closer attention. Ethan would make jokes about the his panic workers when they didn't understand English perfectly, called them lazy behind their backs, said they were taking jobs from real Americans. This bothered me since half my crew speak Spanish as their first language. One day, I overheard Ethan talking to another new guy during lunch. He was bragging about his.

And I'm so proud of him. The call came through my commanding officer. Your son committed felony assault at his father's wedding. You need to get home now. I was on a base in Germany and hadn't seen my boys in eight months. Now my teenage son, who stopped wrestling because he hated hurting people, was facing charges for brutalizing a woman at the altar. After an 18 hour emergency flight, I. I headed to my ex husband's house, where my son was. The wife's dark blood was still stained by the driveway. I rang the doorbell. My ex husband, Conrad answered, his face twisted with rage. We're pressing charges. I'm not taking anyone's side until I see both, I said, pushing past him. The living room was a tribunal. Conrad's parents on the couch, his brother Potter by the fireplace, his sister Fenn in the corner. The bride's parents standing like guard dogs. And in the center, the bride, Lauren, with a splinted nose, two black eyes, bandages across her face. She was crying, dabbing her eyes carefully around the swelling. And there, surrounded by this mob, sat my son. My fourteen year old, who refused to kill insects because he could have been born an ant. Who taught his little stepbrother origami. He sat perfectly straight, chin raised, looking me dead in the eyes with zero regret. He looked proud of what he did. Your son destroyed our family! Conrad spat. Look what he did to her face! Lauren sobbed harder. He's an animal. They're trying him as an adult, right? Grandpa shook his head in disgust. I looked at my son. His knuckles were still bruised and swollen. There seemed to be no real excuse. But then I asked for his side of the story. He looked around the room slowly, taking in every face. Then he spoke, voice clear. You wanna know the truth? She's been molesting me for six months. That's why I did it. My world stopped, but the room exploded instantly. Liar! Disgusting! How dare you! Lauren's face shifted for just a second before she wailed louder. He's making it up! I've been nothing but loving her mother stepped forward, pointing at my son. You evil little. But her father grabbed her arm, his face pale like he'd been expecting this. In the midst of all the chaos, my son pulled out his phone and swiped to his hidden photos. She said, fourteen year old boys always want it. Said I should be grateful. I saw the images over his shoulder and my stomach turned. Conrad's hands were shaking as he stared at the screen. Those could be anyone. Could have. But his voice was hollow, like he was reading a script. He didn't believe Lauren tried to snatch the phone. Those are out of context. I it was just. She stopped realizing. She just admitted they were real. My son stood up, voice shaking with rage. Dad, I told you three months ago. You said, she's just being affectionate. Conrad started stuttering. I didn't. I thought. Grandpa, you laughed. Lucky boy. Wish I had that problem at 14. Grandpa's face went from red to white. He looked at Lauren, then at his grandson, and something crumbled in his expression. Aunt Fenn, you told me. Don't be dramatic. Fenn was backing toward the door, tears streaming. Oh, god! Oh, god! I thought you were just Uncle Potter. You said I should be grateful. Potter had his head in his hands. Jesus Christ! I was joking. I didn't know she was actually grandma. You said boys can't be great by women. Grandma collapsed into the couch, rosary beads in her hands, whispering prayers. Every single one of you told me to shut up about it. Lauren's parents were having a whispered argument. Her father hissed, not again, Patricia. You said she was better. The word again hung in the air. But that's not why I hit her. My son cut through. Everyone immediately froze. What do you

I need extra hands. Yeah, I don't think so. I wasn't about to climb into a bathroom stall with a freak. No, please. I think I might bleed out. Her voice was shaking. And suddenly this wasn't funny anymore. It was summer from my English class, a pregnant senior who everyone whispered about but nobody really talked to. She was sitting on the toilet, gripping the handicap rail with white knuckles, and her face was covered in sweat. What's wrong? I asked, even though I was starting to guess. Please do something. I'm giving birth. She looked up at me with pure terror in her eyes. My whole body went cold. I was 17 and barely knew how tampons worked, let alone babies. But she was crying and alone, and I couldn't just leave her there. I hopped over the stall divider awkwardly and almost slipped on the wet floor. That's when I saw it. The baby was already crowning. There was blood on the toilet seat and the floor, and summer was making these low groaning sounds that scared me more than anything. This was actually happening in a gross school bathroom with fluorescent lights and graffiti on the walls. I'll be right back. I ran out of the bathroom. Still in shock. I sprinted down the hallway to Missus Bishar's classroom. She was my favourite teacher and The only adult I could think of who wouldn't freak out, I burst through her door, interrupting her lecture on photosynthesis. The whole class stared at me. I need your help urgently, please. I was out of breath and probably looked insane. Missus Bashar took one look at my face and followed me without asking questions. We ran back to the bathroom and I could hear summer sounds getting louder. Other kids were starting to peek out of classrooms wondering what was happening. Missus Bishar pushed open the stall door and immediately went into teacher mode. Okay, honey, I'm here. You're doing great. I'm going to support you while she gets the nurse. I didn't need to be told twice. I ran to the nurse's office faster than I'd ever run in PE. When I burst through the door, Nurse Patty was checking Casey's temperature. Casey, who everyone knew was Summer's boyfriend, the guy who'd been bragging about becoming a dad at prom. Summer's having her baby in the bathroom right now. I basically screamed it. Casey's face went from white to green. He threw up all over the floor before Nurse Patty could grab a trash can. But we didn't have time to deal with that. Three of us ran back to the bathroom with nurse Patty grabbing emergency supplies from her cabinet. By now, half the school had heard something was happening. Kids were crowding outside the bathroom doors trying to figure out what all the screaming was. About teachers were trying to move them back to class, but nobody was listening. When we got back to the stall, it was chaos. Missus Bashar was holding Summer's hand while she pushed. The nurse immediately took over, checking how dilated she was and telling summer to breathe. Casey stood frozen in the doorway looking like he might pass out. That's when summer grabbed my hand and pulled me close. You have to get.

So I work as a social worker at the small hospital, and my dad's been an E R. Charge nurse there for, like, 15 years. Pretty much everyone who works there knows he's my dad. We have the same last name on our badges. People see us together all the time. It's not a secret or anything. A few weeks ago, I was down in the E R. Trying to sort out placement for this elderly patient who needed to go to a nursing home, but his insurance was being difficult. Standard Tuesday stuff. When I was done, I ran into my dad in the hallway, and we were just talking about normal stuff. He asked if I was still coming to dinner that weekend and gave me a hug before I left. Made some joke about ordering the most expensive thing on the menu since it was his turn to pay. Something dumb like that. We were literally just standing there having a completely normal father daughter conversation in the middle of the hallway where anyone could see us. Now, there was this new nurse at the nurse's station, like 10 feet away. She'd only been working there maybe three weeks. I'd seen her around, but we'd never really talked. Apparently, she heard our conversation and saw my dad hug me, and her brain just went to the worst possible place instead of Asking literally anyone about it, or, I don't know, minding her own business. She immediately started telling people that my dad was having an affair with me. The hospital social worker, she knew my dad was married because my mom brings him lunch sometimes and wears her wedding ring. This nurse is just going around telling anyone who'll listen that she witnessed my dad and some woman planning a date and being all affectionate in the hallway. She was acting like she'd uncovered some huge scandal. One of the older nurses who I've known since I started working there, came and found me like an hour later. She pulled me into an empty room and was like, I need to tell you something, and you're probably going to wanna sit down. Then she explained that the new nurse was spreading rumours that my dad was cheating on my mom with me. Except she didn't know it was me. She just kept saying the social worker. I was so confused at first. Like, it took me a minute to even process what she was saying. Then I got pissed. This woman had been working there for three weeks and already starting drama based on absolutely nothing. The thing is, I really hate gossip. I know that sounds dramatic, but I've seen gossip destroy people's reputations at hospitals before. Nurses can be the worst about it, too. Not all of them, obviously, but there's always a few who treat the nurses. Station Like it's their personal drama headquarters. Instead of actually doing their jobs. I didn't even bother confronting her. I went straight to HR and filed a formal complaint. I explained exactly what happened, that she was telling people my dad was having an affair when I'm literally his daughter, and that she hadn't bothered to verify anything before spreading it around. HR took it pretty seriously. They called all three of us in after our shifts. Me, my dad, and the new nurse. The HR lady already knew my dad was my father. She'd worked there for years.

The pressure is building because my last perm is growing out badly. My roots are showing completely straight hair and the curls are getting looser every day. Rachel noticed yesterday morning and asked why my hair looks so different lately and whether I've been using new products. I told her it's just stress from being a new dad, but she keeps touching it and frowning. Things escalated last night when Rachel suggested getting one of those Ancestry DNA kits for Mia just for fun to see what other genetics are rises might be hiding in our family background. She's convinced there must be some unknown curly haired relatives that would explain everything. I've been dodging the DNA conversation, but she already ordered the kit online. It arrives third Thursday. Meanwhile, my next perm appointment is scheduled for next week, but Rachel wants to come with me to finally meet my college buddy Mike, who I supposedly visit so often. I obviously can't bring her to a hair salon, so I've been making excuses about Mike being busy with work. The worst part happened this morning. Rachel was changing me his diaper when she noticed something that made her freeze. She called me over and pointed to a tiny birthmark on Mia's shoulder shaped exactly like a crescent moon. That's so weird, Rachel said, studying it carefully. My ex boyfriend Kevin had the exact same birthmark in the exact same spot. I always thought it Was so unique, my blood went cold. Kevin is Rachel's ex from two years before we met. They dated for eight months and Rachel always said he was the one that got away until his job transferred him across the country. Rachel kept staring at the birthmark and at me as curls and back at the birthmark. This is probably just a coincidence, right? She asked, but her voice sounded uncertain. Now I'm realizing the timeline might work. Rachel and I started dating in March, but she mentioned having a closure dinner with Kevin when he came back to town in February to pack up his apartment. Miya was born exactly 9 months after that dinner. Rachel hasn't said anything else about Kevin, but she's been acting strange all day. She keeps looking at Mia like she's seeing her for the first time. And she stopped making comments about the curly hair, genetics. The DNA results came in yesterday. Paternal match not detected. Rachel hasn't said much since. Just keeps holding Mia a little tighter like she's afraid I'll say something she's not ready to hear. And I haven't booked that perm appointment. Doesn't seem to matter anymore.

I have pin straight hair, always have. But in college, every girl I dated mentioned loving guys with curly hair. After getting rejected one too many times, I started getting perms at this little salon near campus. When I met Rachel three years ago, she immediately ran her fingers through my artificial curls and said curly hair was her biggest weakness. I've been sneaking to a salon two towns over every six months since then, telling Rachel I'm visiting my college buddy Mike. I even Learned to use special curl enhancing products and sleep with a silk pillowcase to maintain the look. The whole routine cost me $400 every visit, but it seemed worth it to keep right. So happy now. Our daughter Mia is 3 weeks old with the most gorgeous, tight curls I've ever seen. Rachel keeps taking photos, posting them online with captions like daddy's curls are strong genes and Lucky Girl got the best features from both parents. She even bought matching father daughter headbands for our curly hair club. Here's where it gets complicated. Rachel has pin straight hair, too, and last week she started getting curious about the genetics. He's been researching our family histories, calling both our moms to ask about curly haired relatives. When she couldn't find any on either side going back three generations, she started making Jokes about some mystery ancestor blessing Mia with beautiful curls. Situation got worse when we visited my parents last weekend. My mom pulled out old photo albums, and Rachel found my high school graduation picture with completely straight hair slicked back back with gel. When she asked about it, I panicked and said I used to chemically straighten my hair as a teenager because I was self conscious about my curls. But Rachel's not buying my explanation. She keeps studying baby photos of both of us, muttering about scientifically impossible genetics. Even called her sister Amy, who's a pediatric nurse, to ask detailed questions about how hair texture gets passed down through families. Amy apparently told her that two straight haired parents having a curly haired child is extremely

I was 16 and my favourite band, the one I had posters of all over my walls, announced a two day music festival. The problem, it was three hours away and my parents idea of a fun weekend was repainting the garage. There was a 0% chance they would let me go. So I knew I couldn't ask for permission. I had to create an entire bulletproof alternate reality. I told them our biology club was selected for a special weekend trip to the coast to study tidal pool ecosystems. It sounded smart, right? I spent a week on the family computer designing a permission slip that looked exactly like the ones the school used. I even copied the faint watermark in the background. My best friend Chloe was my partner in crime. Her older brother Kevin, who was 20 and had a deep voice, agreed to be our fake teacher. Mr Henderson. My mom, a former paralegal, read the permission slip like it was a legal contract. She squinted. What's Mister Henderson's school extension? I had anticipated this. I had written down Kevin's cell phone number. My mom nodded, seemingly satisfied. But my dad, an accountant, looked at the trip cost. $250 for a two night biology trip. Seems steep. Where are you staying? My heart hammered in my chest. I quickly said a special research facility connected to the university. It has labs and stuff. Very official. He Just nodded slowly looking at the paper. I thought I was in the clear. The day before I was supposed to leave, my dad came into my room. He was holding his tablet. That's funny, he said, not looking at me. I was just checking the weather for the coast this weekend. It says there's a massive storm system moving in, Hurricane level winds. Surely they'll cancel your trip. I felt the blood drain from my face. My mind went into overdrive. I laughed, trying to sound casual. Oh, yeah, Mister Henderson told us. But the research facility is.

Twice. So I let go completely. Two years later, I walked into that house party with a crowd that left her absolutely stunned. Regina ended it twice. First time at her apartment after dinner. I need space. You're always here, always texting, always needing to know where I am. Second time, when I tried to fix things a month later. You're too clingy. You have no life outside of us. That word destroyed me. Clingy. Like loving someone completely was a character flaw. Three days later, she was already posting stories with hunter, one of our mutual friends from the group. The same hunter who'd been at every game night, every birthday, every random Tuesday hangout. They weren't even subtle about it. Same coffee shop we used to go to, same booth, same drinks. Except now hunter was sitting where I used to be. Our entire friend group just rolled with it. Hunter and Regina just clicked. They'd say like I'd never existed. Like three years of being part of their circle meant nothing. Lorelai, who I helped move twice, suddenly couldn't text back. Graham, who'd crashed at my place countless times, acted like we'd never met. They chose side without anyone asking them to. Was completely alone. No girlfriend, no friends, no weekend plans, no one to text stupid memes to. So I did the only thing I could. Started saying yes to everything. Coworker mentioned a hiking group. Yes. Random gym buddy. Invited me to trivia night. Yes! Neighbor needed someone for their recreational basketball team. Absolutely yes. The hiking group LED to Anna, Declan, and Carlos, three people who actually wanted to hang out. Trivia night introduced me to an entire crew of movie nerds who did weekly screenings. Basketball connected me to guys who grabbed beers without making it feel like an obligation. Within six months, I had three different group chats going. Multiple invites every weekend. Inside jokes with people who didn't know Regina existed. He knew me as the guy who was always down for whatever, not the clingy ex who got dumped while I was building an actual life. Regina and hunter were imploding. According to Instagram, their posts went from constant to sporadic. Couple photos replaced with solo shots. Hunter's friends would occasionally mention drama when I ran into them. She's jealous of everyone. Can't handle him having other friends. Sound familiar? A year and a half in, I met Zoe at a concert my new friends dragged me to. She was there with her roommates, dancing like nobody was watching. We talked between sets about the most random things. She collected vintage postcards, had opinions about every food truck in the city, made me laugh until my sides hurt. When she asked for my number, she said it was because I seemed like someone with good friend group energy. Four months of dating before the universe decided to be hilarious. Her roommate Rachel was dating Someone named Graham? Yeah, that Graham. My former friend who'd ghosted me when Regina chose hunter. When Zoe mentioned meeting Rachel's boyfriend's

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently in just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key. Fury building with every, every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly. This whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me He picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear. From rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialled a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine, it's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we

My neighbour, Missus Kim, had fallen for this exact scam last month and lost $800. Time for payback. I started crying into the phone, oh, no, I can't go to jail. My kids need me. The scammer ate it up. He told me to go to target and buy iTunes gift cards worth $2,000 as a first payment. I said I needed an hour to get the money together. First, I called my cousin Jake, who's a cop, told him what was happening and he said to keep the guy on the line as long as possible. And I started my revenge tour. I called the scammer back an hour later sobbing. I'm at target, but I'm so confused. Which gift cards do I buy? He walked me through it step by step. I pretended to be This helpless single mom who didn't understand technology. Sorry, can you repeat that? My hands are shaking so bad.

Cause arguing with someone who twists every conversation into your personal failings gets exhausting fast. Every disagreement circled back to my shortcomings.

Lila bounced into the room wearing a bright pink dress with unicorns on it, swinging her legs from the big chair and grinning at everyone. The judge smiled and asked her, do you have fun when you stay with your daddy? Lila nodded enthusiastically, oh yes! Daddy lets me wear makeup to the stripper place. The entire room went dead silent.

Scarlett and I have been together for years. I was planning to propose next month. Already had the ring and her dad's blessing.

She looked shocked. You're not going to fight for me. You just told me you want your ex back. What's there to fight for? She met Ben Friday night at some trendy bar. Came home at 2:00am, makeup smeared, hair messy, reeking of his Cologne. We just talked. She lied to my face. Here's what Scarlett didn't know. Her best friend, Paige, had been crushing on me since day one. Told me drunk. At Scarlett's birthday last year, Paige texted, heard about Ben. You okay? She's basically dating him while I pay rent. That's garbage. You deserve better. Want dinner Thursday? Bella Court at 8. Bella? Court, Scarlett's obsession, her favourite restaurant where she Instagrammed every visit. She made her choice time.

Halfway through appetizers, my phone exploded. Are you serious right now? Paige posted from Bella Corte. That's our place. How could you take my best friend there? I showed Paige the messages. He laughed and raised her wine glass to new beginnings. I got home at eleven PM to find Scarlett pacing the living room like a caged animal, practically wearing a path in the carpet. Ben was sprawled on my expensive leather couch scrolling his.

I was 19, totally broke and trying to make rent on this crappy studio in Philly. I worked dishwasher shifts, but it wasn't covering anything. Then I saw this flyer stapled to a telephone pole that said dog walker needed $200 cash daily, small dog, easy walk. That caught my attention real quick. I texted the number and got a reply in like five minutes. Some guy told me to meet behind Angelo's Dry Cleaners at 8 sharp the next morning. I figured it was just some rich guy being weird about his dog. So I showed up and this dude hands me this tiny white poodle wearing a designer sweater that probably cost more than my rent. He also gave me this GPS tracked leash, told me to follow a specific 4 block route, no deviations, no stopping, just walk. The whole thing felt off, but 200 bucks is 200 bucks. The guy didn't even tell me his name, just said be back here in exactly 30 minutes. I walked the road and came back. He handed me cash, no questions asked. I wasn't complaining. This went on for 2 solid weeks, same time, same dog, same route. The poodle was actually pretty chill. Sometimes I'd catch people staring at us, but I figured it was just because this dog had better clothes than most people. The money was keeping me fed and my landlord happy, so I didn't Ask questions. Then one morning, everything changed. We were on Broad Street when a fire truck came screaming by with sirens blasting. The little dog freaked out and slipped right out of his collar. My heart stopped. I'm chasing this tiny white poodle through traffic, thinking I just lost my meal ticket. I finally caught him near this bus stop and scooped him up. That's when I noticed something weird about the collar. It felt heavier than it should and there was this little gap in the.

Our cafeteria had this weird echo problem in the back corner where the ceiling tiles were loose. If you whispered there during lunch, it would amplify and carry across the entire room like a ghost voice. I discovered this by accident when I was hiding back there, eating alone, complaining under my breath about Mr. Rodriguez's impossible math test. Suddenly, half the cafeteria turned around looking confused. That's when the idea hit me. I started small, whispering random stuff during lunch to test the range. Someone left their car lights on. Or free pizza in the gym. Just enough to watch heads turn and people look around confused. The acoustics were perfect. My voice would bounce off the loose tiles, get amplified by the weird ceiling cavity, then float across the room like some supernatural announcement. It sounded nothing like my normal voice. More like a distant radio transmission or a voice from another dimension. But then I overheard the drama that would change everything. Jessica Chen was bragging to her friends about how she'd been anonymously reporting kids to administration for vaping. I've gotten, like, 12 people suspended. He laughed. They have no idea it's me. I just sent anonymous tips to Principal Walsh's email. She was proud of it. Genuinely proud of ruining people's lives for a few extra points on her college applications. Perfect Target acquired. The next day, during lunch, I positioned myself in the Echo corner. I Waited until Jessica was surrounded by her usual crowd, then whispered just loud enough Jessica Chen is the vaping snitch. The whisper.

My boyfriend brought his new coworker Dave to our housewarming party last weekend. I have a 13 year old beagle named Murphy who's blind in one eye from an accident years ago and moves pretty slowly these days. He's the sweetest old guy. Never bothers anyone, just likes to find a cozy spot and watch the world go by. I'd invited about 20 people over to show off our new lace. Everyone was having a great time, music playing, people mingling between the kitchen and living room. Murphy had claimed his usual spot by the fireplace, occasionally getting gentle pets from guests who thought he was adorable. About an hour into the party, I realized I hadn't seen Murphy in a while. That's unusual because he never wanders far from wherever the action is. Started looking around, calling his name softly so I wouldn't alarm anyone. Finally found him locked in the laundry room, whimpering and scratching at the door. The moment I opened it, he practically collapsed into my arms. When I helped him stand, he was limping badly on his back right leg. My heart immediately started racing. Murphy's old and fragile. Any injury could be serious. I carried him back to the living room and asked everyone what happened, trying to keep my voice calm, but probably failing. Most of my guests looked genuinely concerned and confused. A few people mentioned seeing Him earlier, but nothing seemed wrong. That's when Dave, who'd been standing by the beer cooler looking completely unbothered, started laughing. Oh yeah, that old dog kept getting in my way while I was grabbing another beer, he said casually, like he was talking about the weather. Kept bumping into my legs, so I gave him a little kick to move him along. No big deal. The entire room went silent. I stared at him in complete shock, not sure I'd heard correctly. You kicked my 13 year old blind dog? I asked, my voice probably getting louder than I intended. Dave just shrugged with this annoying smirk. Barely touched him. He's fine. Obviously dogs need to learn boundaries anyway. Can't just let them walk all over you. My boyfriend's face went completely pale, and he immediately started apologizing, clearly mortified. But I was already seeing red. Murphy was now hiding behind my legs, trembling and refusing to put weight on his injured paw. Everyone needs to leave right now, I announced to the room. Everyone except you. I pointed directly at Dave. You're staying to explain this to someone special. My guests filed out quickly, many of them shooting disgusted looks at Dave and offering to help with Murphy. My boyfriend hesitated, but I told him he needed to leave too, and think about the kind and of people he brings around. Once the house cleared, I called my neighbor Jim. He's a retired police officer who absolutely adores Murphy and has a spare key to check on him when I travel for work. Jim treats Murphy like his own grand dog. Jim arrived within five minutes. Still in his week

My sister called me a bad mom until her kid told me the truth. When Emma asked if she could dye her hair blue for her 13th birthday, I said, sure, it's just hair, right? She'd been begging me for weeks, showing me Pinterest photos of these gorgeous ocean blue highlights at target. We picked out some semi permanent dye that would wash out in a month. She was so excited she could barely sit still while I painted the streaks in our tiny bathroom. The next morning at breakfast, she kept flipping her hair and grinning at herself in the toaster reflection. I made her favorite blueberry pancakes and she kept saying how the blue and her hair match the berries perfectly. honestly the happiest I'd seen her since her dad moved out last year. But when we showed up at my sister Beth's house for Sunday dinner, everything went sideways fast. Beth took one look at Emma and her face just dropped. He pulled me into the kitchen while Emma was playing with her cousins and started going off about how irresponsible I was being. What kind of message does this send, she whispered harshly, gesturing toward the living room. She's going to look like some delinquent at school. I tried explaining it was just temporary hair dye, that Emma was still getting straight A's and playing violin. But Beth wouldn't hear it. She kept shaking her head and muttering About how I was clearly struggling as a single mom and needed to set better boundaries. The whole dinner was awkward after that with Beth making passive aggressive comments about certain parenting choices every time Emma's hair caught the light. When we got home that night, Emma seemed deflated. She kept touching her hair and asking if I thought it looked stupid. I reassured her it looked amazing, but I could tell Beth's reaction had gotten to her. That's when I decided to call my mom to vent about the whole thing. Mom listened patiently while I ranted about Beth being judgmental. Then she got quiet for a moment. Honey, she said carefully, there's something you should probably know about your sister's situation. Apparently, Beth had been calling.

Everyone laughed except me. I quietly raised my hot dog and said, challenge accepted. That night, I packed everything into two suitcases and left my key on the kitchen counter. No, no, no. Goodbye. Just gone. I've been the family doormat for 29 years, the one who organized every holiday, baked every birthday cake and cleaned up everyone's messes while they took selfies without me. So when mom made that joke at our BBQ with my aunts and siblings all laughing, something inside me just clicked. I moved three hours away to a lakeside cabin, blocked everyone's numbers and started over as Jade instead of JD, the nickname that made me feel like a child. For the first week, my phone stayed silent, exactly like mom predicted. But Week 2, 2, my brother called 47 times. Turns out nobody knew how to work the washing machine I've been maintaining for years. Their clothes piled up like a laundry mountain until he finally had to buy new underwear instead of figuring out the spin cycle. Week 3, my sister showed up at my old job crying, begging my former co workers for my new number. She had a family emergency, aka, didn't figure out how to renew her car registration, the same registration I've been handling for her since she was 16. My co workers told her I'd Moved states away. She broke down in the parking lot because she'd never even Learned where the DMV was located. She ended up paying $300 to some sketchy guy who promised to handle it. Month two, Dad drove to every apartment complex in the city looking for me. He'd never realized I was the one who remembered everyone's medication schedules, grocery lists and which bills were due when without me. He missed his blood pressure medication for three weeks and had to go to urgent care. The doctor asked if he had family support at home. Dad just stared at the floor or and mumbled something about his daughter being away. Mom had a complete breakdown when she realized I've been handling all the family birthdays, anniversary reminders and doctor appointments for decades. She forgot her own sister's birthday for the first time in 40 years and had to hear about it at Sunday dinner. The woman who said nobody would notice was now hiring a professional organizer for $200 a week to do what I've done for free my entire adult life. Even then, the organizer quit after two weeks because mom kept asking her to just handle it like Jade used to. My aunt called mom crying because no one had organized the annual Christmas cookie exchange. It was complete chaos. People brought store bought cookies. Nobody knew the gift ex change rules. I've been coordinating for a decade and three families showed up on the wrong day. Meanwhile, I was learning pottery at the community center, taking morning hikes by the lake and sleeping in without someone banging on my door needing me to fix their problems before 7:00am. For the first time in my life, my calendar belonged to me. Last week, mom finally tracked down my number through my old college roommate, Sarah, who she'd somehow found on LinkedIn. After calling my high school looking for contacts, she called.

My sister in law, Kelly, had her first miscarriage about six months ago. It was devastating. I get that. The whole family rallied around her and my brother Jake, bringing casseroles and giving them space to. But then she started acting like she was the only person who'd ever lost a baby. It started small. At family dinners, she'd make comments about how nobody understood what real loss felt like. When my cousin Amanda talked about her dog dying, Kelly rolled her eyes and said, that's not the same thing at all. When my mom mentioned missing my grandpa who died last year, Kelly literally scoffed and said, you got to say goodbye to him, though. The worst part was how she treated me. I've been married to my husband Chris for eight years, and we don't have kids yet. Kelly started making these passive aggressive comments about how lucky I was to not have to worry about these things, how I couldn't possibly understand what she was going through. Last weekend was my nephew's birthday party. Kelly seemed okay during most of it, playing with the kids and laughing at their jokes. But then my brother's friend brought up how his wife was pregnant, and Kelly's whole mood shifted. She got quiet and started picking out her food. Later, when we were in the kitchen cleaning up, Kelly started talking About how hard it was seeing pregnant women everywhere. I tried to be supportive, telling her I understood how triggering that must be. That's when she snapped. No, you don't understand, she said, her voice getting louder. You have no idea what it's like to lose a baby. You've never even been pregnant. You don't know what real loss feels like. Something inside me just broke. I've been holding this in for years, keeping it private, because Chris and I decided we didn't want the whole family knowing our business. But I was so tired of her acting like she had a monopoly on grief. Actually, Kelly, I said, my voice shaking, I've had four miscarriages. The kitchen went dead silent. My mom dropped the plate she was holding. Kelly's face went completely white. The first one was three years ago. I can continued. I was 12 weeks along. We thought we were safe to tell people, but then I started bleeding at work. Chris had to pick me up from the bathroom floor. Kelly tried to say something, but I kept going. The second one was a year later. Only eight weeks that time, but it didn't hurt any less. The third one was right before Christmas last year. I spent New Year's Eve in the hospital. The fourth one was two months ago.

So I stopped talking to everyone and they couldn't handle it. My grandfather was a psychologist who believed silence revealed character. Terminal cancer. Final experiment. Sit in complete silence with him one hour weekly for six months. Win his 4.7 million dollar estate. Comfort in silence shows presence over performance. Say from his hospice bed. While my relatives planned strategies, my cousins immediately started practicing meditation apps and silence retreats. My aunt hired a Buddhist monk. My uncle read 17 books on quiet. They treated it like Olympics training, posting their silence journey on social media. Meanwhile, they couldn't shut up about the money. I'm doing two hours of silence practice every morning. My cousin Melissa would brag at family dinners. Grandpa will see how dedicated I am. I've been volunteering at silent meditation retreats. My brother Jake would counter, I'm basically a professional at this. They were missing the point entirely. The first Saturday arrived. My aunt went first, sitting confidently across from Grandpa. She lasted nine minutes before asking if he needed water. Disqualified. My uncle made it 18 minutes before checking his phone. Disqualified. Melissa brought her meditation app and Tibetan singing bowl six minutes before the notification went off. Disqualified. Jake started telling Grandpa about his silence techniques at the four minute Mark. Disqualified. One by one, they failed. Some talked, some fidgeted, some fell asleep. But they all broke the silence. Within 30 minutes and came my turn. I walked in, sat down and looked at him. Really looked at him. Not at a dying man, not at a bank account. Just at my grandfather, who used to take me fishing when I was seven. We sat there 60 minutes. I cried silently around minute 40, when I noticed how much weight he'd lost. He cried around minute 50, remembering my grandmother who'd passed two years earlier. When the hour ended, he smiled and said, same time next week. I nodded. My family couldn't comprehend it. How did you do it? They demand. What's your secret? Are you on medication? Did you hypnotize yourself? I just sat with him, I'd say. But how? Melissa would press, what were you thinking about him? I'd answer. This made them angrier. They'd spent thousands on courses, retreats and meditation coaches. I'd spent nothing and succeeded every single week, while they kept failing. They started accusing me of cheating. She must be using hand signals, my aunt claimed. Or maybe they're texting each other. The hospice staff had to install a camera to prove I wasn't doing anything except sitting there. Week after week, I'd arrive and exist with my dying grandfather while they studied camera footage for my trick. There was no trick. I simply loved him enough to stop performing. By month four, they stopped coming. Humiliating, Jake admitted, we can't even last 15 minutes while you sit there for an hour. Like It's nothing. It's not nothing. I told him it's everything. Grandpa died two weeks before the six month Mark. At the will reading, my family showed up dressed in black. Already are

My high school had this bizarre rumor about an abandoned swimming pool beneath the gym. Everyone whispered that a student drowned there in the 70s and the school sealed it off instead of dealing with a scandal. Some said you could still hear splashing if you pressed your ear to the floor tiles near the boys locker room. I always rolled my eyes at this stuff. Our school was built in 1992. Said so right on the cornerstone. No way it had some secret underground pool. Until I got Saturday detention for skipping class. The detention supervisor, Coach Miller, had me organizing equipment in the gym storage room. He handed me keys and told me to inventory everything, then disappeared. While counting basketballs, I noticed a metal door behind some gymnastics mats. The lock was old, different from the modern ones on classroom doors. Out of curiosity, I tried the keys. The fifth one worked. The door opened to a narrow staircase. Going down, the air smelled damp and chlorinated. I followed the stairs using my phone flashlight. At the bottom was another door with faded letters. Pool facility staff only. My heart was pounding as I pushed it open. There it was. A full sized swimming pool, completely intact. The water was dark but clear. Lane dividers still stretched across the surface. A scoreboard frozen at 1973. What was strangest, the place looked maintained. No debris, no major decay. Abandoned as I walked around the edge. My flashlight caught something at the bottom of the deep end. A glint of metal. I took a photo, then zoomed in. It looked like a class ring. That's when I heard footsteps on the stairs. I quickly hid behind the bleachers as Principal Whitaker and Coach Miller entered. They weren't alone. A third man in a dark suit carried scientific equipment. Readings are stronger this month, the suit guy said, setting up some kind of meter near the pool's edge. Principal Whitaker sighed. Can't we just drain it? It's been 50 years. You know that's not possible, the man replied. The agreement was clear. Maintain the site, keep it sealed, receive funding. Coach Miller noticed the door I'd left slightly open. Someone's been in here. Check the cameras, Whitaker ordered. If it's students, we'll handle it internally. The suit guy laughed. Like you handled Jason Mercer and 73? That worked out well. They left after taking water samples. I waited before sneaking out that night. I researched Jason Mercer and our school name. Nothing came up. Our online archives only went back to 1993. I texted my friend Ellie about what I'd found. She didn't believe me, so I sent her the pool photo. She called immediately. Delete that. My dad worked construction here. He said workers quit because of what they found. During renovation, the school paid everyone to stay quiet. The next morning, my phone was wiped clean. Factory reset. All my Photos, messages, everything gone. Principal Whittaker announced a mandatory assembly about respecting restricted areas. Coach Miller

In our house, nobody sits in the green chair, ever. People laugh when I tell them this rule until they visit. It started when I was pregnant. Jake found this ugly green recliner at a yard sale for $5. The elderly woman selling it grabbed Jake's arm and whispered, just take it away. Red flag. Absolutely. Did we listen? Nope. That night, our dog refused to enter the living room. She'd stand at the doorway growling at the empty chair. Three days later, Jake's mom visited. She sat in the chair before I could warn her, immediately screamed in pain. A rusty spring sliced her leg open. Seven stitches and a tetanus shot later. We checked the chair for the spring. Nothing there. Completely gone. A week later, our neighbor Dave helped move furniture and sat in the green chair. That evening, car accident. As paramedics took him away, he kept mumbling about an old man who told me to crash. My sister laughed at our chair superstition and deliberately sat in it. Her phone instantly drained from 100% to dead. She got a call on our landline minutes later. Dream job rejection. As she cried, the lights flickered but only above the chair. Jake's boss came to dinner, ignored my warnings. Three days later, massive company layoffs. Jake fired first. That same night, 3:17 a. M. Exactly, every smoke alarm in our house screamed to life. Only above the chair, ice cold air you could see your breath in. My dad, the ultimate skeptic, sat in it at Thanksgiving. Bunch of nonsense, he scoffed. Two, two hours later, emergency room kidney stones. Doctor said they formed faster than he'd ever seen in 30 years of medicine. Our daughter Lily was 3 when she started warning visitors, bad chair hurts people, she'd say, eyes wide. We never discuss the chair around her. When Lily was 7, her best friend Mia sat in the chair during a playdate. I heard Lily's blood curdling scream from the kitchen, ran in to find Mia frozen, staring at something none of us could see. Two weeks later, Mia's family suddenly moved across the country. Her mom called me, voice shaking. Mia keeps drawing your green chair in her nightmares. My teenage son Ben sat in it on a dare from his friends. At night I found him sleepwalking, standing in front of the chair whispering to it. When I woke him, he grabbed my arm. Mom, there's an old man who sits there when we're sleeping. He's watching us. Jake tried destroying the chair once, took a chainsaw to it. The chainsaw died mid cut. That night, Jake woke up with identical chainsaw marks on his arm. Jake's brother slept in the chair to prove us wrong. Within 48 hours, flight cancelled, luggage vanished, wallet stolen, apartment flooded. Girlfriend left him. He called sobbing. I see him every time I close My eyes now. We left it at the curb. Garbage men refuse to touch it. One crossed himself and whispered, that's the chair from Miller Street, isn't it? We've never met him before. The thrift store called us frantically to take it.

My art teacher, Missus Chen, absolutely despised that I drew manga characters instead of her boring still life assignments. Every class, she'd walk around critiquing everyone's work. But when she got to my desk, she'd make this gusted face like I was drawing garbage. She started small at first, little comments like, this isn't real art or you need to focus on fundamentals. But it escalated quickly when other kids started asking me to draw their favorite anime characters during lunch. Missus Chen called me to her desk one day and said if I kept drawing cartoons in her class, she'd fail me for the semester. I tried explaining that manga was a legitimate art form in Japan, but she cut me off, saying we weren't in Japan and I needed to grow up. And the breaking point came when she assigned us to create family portraits for the big school art show. Then all the parents would be there, plus the school board and local newspaper. It was supposed to showcase our best work. I spent three weeks perfecting this incredible manga style family portrait. My little sister was a magical girl with glowing powers. My dad was a samurai warrior. My mom was an elegant princess. And I drew myself as the artist, bringing them all to life. The detail work was insane. Every fold in their clothes, every strand of hair perfectly shaded. I was so proud. When I turned it in, missus Chen took one look, grabbed it with both hands, and tore it clean in half right in front of the entire class. This garbage doesn't belong in our show, she announced loud enough for everyone to hear. Draw something normal or get a zero. For the entire semester, I sat there staring at my destroyed artwork scattered on the floor. Three weeks of work gone. Some kids were snickering, others looked uncomfortable, but nobody said anything. I went home that night and taped the pieces back together, crying over every ripped line. Then I started over with the most boring, traditional family portrait you could imagine. Just basic pencil sketches with zero personality. The night of the art show arrived. The school gallery was packed with parents admiring all the displayed artwork. Mine wasn't there, of course. Missus Chen had hung up literally everyone else's work except mine. I was standing in the corner, feeling invisible, when my older brother, Jake showed up. He's a tattoo artist who owns his own shop downtown. He noticed me looking miserable and asked what was wrong. I showed him my torn drawing that I brought along. Jake studied it carefully, running his fingers over the tape marks. Who did this to your art? He asked quietly. I told him everything about the constant criticism, the threats to fail me, and how she destroyed my best work. Jake just nodded and said, bring me to this teacher. We Found Missus Chen surrounded by parents bragging about her teaching methods and how she was molding young artists with proper fundamentals. She was dismissing modern cartoon styles as worthless distractions from real artistic development. Jake walked up and introduced himself as a local professional artist who was interested in seeing student work. Missus Chen immediately perked up and started showing off her

After I inherited Grandpa's house, my whole family turned on me. Said I was selfish, greedy, didn't deserve it since I never visited him anyway. My cousins especially hated that I got the family home while they got nothing. They called me every name in the book. Monster was their favorite. Said I manipulated a dying old man, probably forged the will. At his funeral, my cousin Mike actually stood up during the service and said, some people pray on the elderly for money. Everyone in that chapel knew he meant me. Thanksgiving that year was absolutely brutal. They made me sit at the hold out kids table while the adults discussed how disappointed Grandpa would be with my selfish behavior. My Aunt Janet kept making passive aggressive comments about how certain people weren't raised with proper family value. My own mother wouldn't even make eye contact with me during dinner. The house was a complete disaster when I inherited it. Pipes leaked disgusting brown water everywhere. The roof had holes you could throw a basketball through, and foundation cracks so wide I could stick my entire hand through them. The furnace hadn't worked properly in five years. Grandpa had been living with space Peters and bottled water, basically camping in his own home. I spent the next two years pouring every single cent I had into fixing that place. Took out three different loans, worked Overtime constantly at my job. Learned plumbing and electrical work from YouTube videos. My family mocked me at every opportunity they got, throwing good money after bad. They'd say whenever they drove past and saw on the roof. Should have just sold it and split the cash like any decent person would do. Mike would post on Facebook about my money pit obsession. Janet told everyone at church I was having some kind of mental breakdown. Wasting my life savings on a condemned house. Even my own brother stopped answering my calls because his wife said I was too depressing to be around anymore. The absolute worst part was when I had to skip my daughter's birthday party because I couldn't afford the 50 dollar gift after paying for emergency plumbing that week. My sister made sure everyone knew exactly why I wasn't there. Sarah's too busy playing house with a dead man's junk to care about her living family members. Two years, four months, and $83,000 later, I finally got the place completely livable. New roof, updated electrical system, working plumbing throughout, fresh paint in every single room. I was exhausted and completely broke, but genuinely proud of what I'd accomplished. Then the letters started coming. Official government letterhead from Midwest Mining Corporation. They wanted to discuss my property sitting above what they called a significant lithium deposit. The meeting was absolutely surreal. Three people in expensive suits sitting in my freshly painted kitchen, spreading out detailed geological maps. And survey results all all over my table. Conservative estimate, the lead guy said while adjusting his glasses. We're looking at $12 million worth of extractable lithium. We'd like to offer $8 million up front, plus 15% royalties on everything we extract over the next 20 years. I just stared at that contract for 10 solid minutes, unable to believe the numbers I was seeing. Word travels incredibly fast in small towns, especially when mining company trucks start showing up on your street every day. My phone started ringing the very next morning. Mike, who hadn't spoken to me since the funeral. Hey, Sarah, I've been

She's smiling as she reads the first few lines. Then she stops. Her smile disappears. She reads it again. Her face goes completely white. She looks at me, looks back at the card, then sprints to the bathroom. We can all hear her throwing up loud. The party goes quiet. Everyone's looking around confused. My brother in law rushes after her. Five minutes later, she comes back, mascara running down her face, eyes red. She's holding the recipe card like it's contaminated. You fed us dog food, she screams. Beef tongue and cheeks, that's what I buy for my dog. I feed that to Bella as sweets. My wife's brother looks horrified. What are you talking about? Ashley's hyperventilating now. I buy these at Petsmart, beef cheek rolls, beef tongue strips. They're in the dog aisle. I just ate dog food. She's genuinely crying. Not fake tears, like actual breakdown crying. A few people look uncomfortable. Then my neighbor, Carlos, who's Mexican and grew up in Guadalajara, starts laughing. Not a polite chuckle, full on doubled over laughing. Ashley, that's authentic barbacoa, he said, is wiping his eyes. That's what real tacos are made from. You can't get this at Chipotle. Ashley shakes her head, no, no, I've seen these at the pet store. They're dog treats. I buy them in bulk. Pulls out her phone with shaking hands and shows everyone the Petsmart website. There it is, beef cheek rolls and beef tongue strips. In the dog treat section, 8, 99 per bag. The rooms dead silent. Then I pull out my phone and show everyone my butcher's receipt from yesterday. $47, 50 for the cuts I used. Someone in the back says, wait, her dog eats better meat than I do. Carlos loses it again. Ashley, this is a delicacy. This is traditional Mexican food. Just because Pet Smart sells cheap versions doesn't mean. But Ashley's not hearing it. She's spiraling. I ate hung an actual tongue that was in a cow's mouth. My brother in law is trying to calm her down, but she pushes past him, grabs her purse and heads for the door. On her way out, she passes the food the table. There are still three tacos on her plate. She stops, stares at them for a second. I think she might throw the plate. Instead, she grabs the plate, storms out and we hear her car door slam. My wife looks at me. Did she just take the dog food with her? The entire party erupted. Best housewarming ever.

So I stopped paying. For five years, I was dad in every way that mattered. School pickups, soccer practice, homework help, sick days, parent teacher conferences. I taught her son to drive, helped her daughter with science fair projects, paid for their phones, clothes, everything. Most importantly, their private school. $18,000 per year per kid. Had them on my premium health insurance, paid for braces and therapy. Their bio dad lived across the country, saw them maybe twice a year, paid minimal support. But I was the one there every single day building what I thought was our family. Two weeks ago, everything changed. We were discussing holiday plans and I mentioned taking the kids to see my parents like we'd done every year. Michelle stopped me cold. We need to set some boundaries. The kid kids are feeling confused about your role. You're not their dad. You're mom's boyfriend. They have a dad. The words hit like a punch. The dad they see twice a year. I asked, that doesn't matter. My kids don't see you as their father, except it you're overstepping. Five years of being their father figure and suddenly I was overstepping. So what am I to them? She rolled her eyes. You're my partner who lives here, but you need to stop trying to parent them. See, in the private school, I'm paying for You agreed to help with their education when I thought I was building a family, not when I'm just Mom's boyfriend who needs to know his place. She actually rolled her eyes at me. Don't be dramatic. But I wasn't being dramatic. I was finally seeing clearly. I went to my home office and made three calls. First. First HR to remove both kids from my health insurance. Second, the private school to cancel spring semester tuition. Third, my old apartment manager who still had a unit available. Within three hours, I'd systematically undone five years of financial support. That evening at dinner, I acted completely normal, helped with homework like nothing had changed. Michelle seemed pleased I'd accepted my place. Monday morning, the first domino fell. Michelle got an email from school in tuition was due, 36,000 total. The automatic payment from my account had been cancelled. Her texts flooded in frantically. What did you do? You can't do this to the kids. I responded, once I'm respecting the boundaries you set, their father can handle their education. She came home early. Kids still at school furious. You're seriously pulling them out over a conversation? I'm not pulling them out. You or their father can pay.

I came and my mom said we're going on vacation as a family. Take care of the dog. The room erupted with laughter. My uncle Rick raised his beer and said, someone's got to hold down the fort, right? My sister Laura was already scrolling through her phone, barely paying attention. My dad pointed at the dog and grinned like he just told the world's best joke. I just smiled and nodded. That's always been my role in this family, the reliable one, the one who shows up, keeps quiet and cleans up everyone else's messes while they live their lives. They call it being dependable. What it really means is being convenient. I went home that night with Max, their 10 year old golden retriever who seemed genuinely happy to see me. At least someone was. Two days later, my phone buzzed with a fraud alert. Someone had tried to charge $4,000 to my credit card for a vacation package to using my name, my billing address, everything. I stared at the notification for a full minute before it clicked. I canceled the charge immediately. Less than an hour later, my dad texted, be serious. No explanation, no apology, just those two words, like I was the one being unreasonable. I opened Venmo, sent him 50 cents and wrote in the notes, I'm not family. Then I muted my phone. By the time I checked it again, I had 53 Messages. Laura said I was being dramatic and needed to grow up. Mom sent a paragraph about how family sticks to together through everything. Madison called me selfish. Rick sent a thumbs down emoji, which somehow felt worse than actual words. My grandma texted, really, Kevin? That one hurt more than I expected. They acted like I burned the house down all because I wouldn't let them steal from me. I didn't respond to any of them. I just sat there at my kitchen table with Max snoring at my feet. I started going through old emails, receipts, loan documents, co signing forms I barely remembered agreeing to. Venmo transactions I'd forgotten about. Text messages asking for temporary help that turned permanent. I opened a spreadsheet and started adding it all up. There was the 20 four hundred dollars I sent Laura when she swore her car was getting repossessed. The eight thousand dollar loan I co signed for Uncle Rick's investment opportunity that was supposed to pay me back in six months. That was three years ago. Then there was the roof loan. My parents never asked how that got resolved. They just assumed it sorted itself out. It didn't. I've been making monthly payments on it for two years. The total climbed higher than I thought possible, $42,000. $42,000 I've given to people who are currently posting airport selfies and matching t shirts that said Family Mode on. I didn't sleep that night. I wasn't even angry yet. Just numb. I made black coffee and kept working on my spreadsheet, adding details I tried to forget. By 3:00am, I had everything documented, every loan, every favor, every time. I've been the backup plan. The next morning they started posting photos from Cancun. Dad with his golf clubs. I'm doing that sideways lean thing she does. In every group photo, Laura's story had a sunset with the caption, finally peace and quiet. I almost laughed. Then on Friday at three twenty PM, I got an email from a bank I'd never worked with. Subject line, urgent loan verification required. I opened it. Someone had taken out a 25 thousand dollar personal loan in my name, my full legal name, my Social security number, my work email, which I'd never once used for personal banking. The fuck.

My new dad says you're a loser and I should take a real man's name. My wife smiled. I said, fine. A week later, the family lawyer called. Ma'am, do you realize what you just let him sign away? It happened last Sunday at brunch. My son Ethan, 6 teen, stood up in front of 20 people and said, I don't want your last name anymore. My new dad says you're a loser. I want to take his name instead. The room went silent. Forks froze midair. His step cousins laughed. My ex wife Claire smiled smugly like it was the victory she'd been waiting for. I didn't argue. I didn't plead. I reached into my jacket, slid an envelope across the table and placed a pen beside it. Fine, I said. I'm here. Ethan hesitated for barely two seconds before scrolling his name across the page like he was signing a football. Claire raised her glass in a mock toast. I lifted mine too. To Ethan, may you get everything you just asked for. See, I wasn't blindsided. I'd seen this coming for months. Ethan copying his stepdad's haircut. Claire whispering in his ear that real men built startups and drove Escalades. Her new husband calling me Jerry even after I corrected him three times. So three years ago after the divorce, I prepared, I rewrote the family trust, burying a clause deep in the legal framework. It if A descendant renounces the family name voluntarily, they forfeit everything tied to it. No second chances. That brunch wasn't a humiliation. It was documentation Ethan signed in front of witnesses. I'm even filmed it. He thought he was making a statement. What he really did was lock a door behind him forever. The fallout started quietly. Three days later, Ethan logged into his university portal. His Caldwell Legacy Scholarship worth $42,800 finished balance due the full amount. He panicked, refreshing the page over and over. Claire brushed it off. It's probably a glitch. I'll call someone. Then the car insurance card I'd kept active for him stopped working. His health plan access was revoked. Seed investment role he'd been promised in a family startup disappeared overnight. One by one, every safety net snapped. That Friday, Claire's phone rang, a number she didn't recognize. She answered on speaker. This is Deborah Caldwell, a calm voice replied. Ma'am, this is Michael, counsel for the Caldwell Trust. I'm calling to confirm your son's voluntary renunciation of the Caldwell name. Clause 14.7 has been executed. He is no longer a beneficiary of the estate. Claire's wine glass hit the counter. You can't be serious. His college fund, his rights. Respectfully, the lawyer cut her off. Your son signed away all eligibility. This action is binding. There is no appeal. The line went silent. Then she dropped the phone. Ethan just stared pale. The next week was chaos for them. Ethan texted me at 2:17 A m. Dad, can we talk, please? I didn't reply because it wasn't about anger anymore. It was about choice. I.

It started with phone cases. My three best friends and I, Maya, Liam and Chloe, decided to start a small online shop. We'd spend weekends in my garage hand painting cool designs and bringing them out. We were a team. We even opened a shared bank account just for the business. The rule was simple. All the money goes in and we only use it for supplies. For a while, it was perfect. We're actually making a profit. But then weird things started happening. Ten dollars vanished, then 20. We'd all look at the account confused. We blamed it on bank fees, maybe a miscalculation. But when a 50 dollar transaction appeared that no one could explain, the mood shifted. We had a meeting in the garage, but it felt more like an interrogation. Liam got super defensive, which made him look guilty. Maya was so quiet. She seemed like she was hiding something. And Chloe just kept trying to nervously make peace. The trust was gone. Every sale notification, instead of being exciting, just made my stomach tighten. We weren't a team anymore. We were just four people sitting in a room full of paint fumes wondering who the thief was. I couldn't sleep, so I ended up telling my mom everything. She's an accountant and her brain just works differently. She saw how torn up I was and said, let's Stop guessing and start looking. She didn't want to hear.

She matched the exact time of every expense with the exact time of every sale. Suddenly, she stopped clicking. Here it is, she said. Pointing to the screen, she found the pattern.

The money wasn't going back to the customer. My mom dug deeper into the store's payment settings, a section we never even knew existed. She found a hidden rule.

This is two year old Kaimir Jones of Michigan. This is his mother, Adriana Jones. On October 4th, she took her son to Stacy Cobb's home. Stacy was a well recommended babysitter in the area. This isn't the first time that she had taken Chimera there while she was at work. A motherly intuition kicked in that something was wrong on this day because usually her and Stacy would communicate about how Chimera was doing during the day. On this day, three hours had gone by and there was no response from the babysitter. Adriana decided to leave work and go check on her son at the babysitter's house. To her shock, when she got there, tons of police were already there. Premier's mother walked into a horrific scene where she had to see her son mauled by this babysitter's dogs. He had lost his life. What's even worse is that she says that the police didn't even call her and try to let her know. This is how she found out. Adriana made a gofundme, which I'm going to link in my bio. In some news articles, it tells you that the babysitter said that she just went to take a nap. We're going to share what Adriana did, and this is all alleged per camera footage. She says that her son was not being watched by the babysitter. He was left alone for up to two hours. While she was allegedly unconscious on the floor due to substance abuse. Eventually, you see Chaimir unlocking the door to go outside, where there were two pitbulls. These dogs ended up mauling him to death. And then you can see what else she said about how this situation took place hours before she even knew about it. And she wasn't called. She had to walk into this scene, just watching everybody take. Take pictures of what was going on. Now, Stacy alleges that she took a nap and that she thought that Chaimer was taking a nap as well. She has been charged with second degree unaliving

Sam, this is John Sheptock. He was born with no arms and one of his legs shorter than the other. He's associated with the First Montgomery Church. He's known as an inspiration for dealing with the adversities of his disability. He's also known for going to prisons and speaking and preaching there, as well as singing. All of this came to a halt, however, on September 29th of this year, 2025, when he was arrested for distributing child porn, which we're going to call it like it really is, which is. See, Sam, he was found and arrested while he was ministering to prison inmates at the time. Some of his accusations include gaining access to a teenager's icloud account, stealing private photos, and then attempting to coerce her into sending more explicit images. Also showed the same victim nude photos of underage girls. Following his arrest, the church immediately made a statement saying John had been arrested on these charges and that they removed him from all responsibilities at the church. October 7th, they also put out another statement with a new allegation against John from an adult connected to the church. When there's one rat, there's usually 50 more. So there's no telling what else is going to come out in this case. But why am I increasingly not surprised at the types of cases of judges, people in authority, politics, churches, schools, that Are doing this kind of stuff

Please take a wild guess at what you think this woman did as she just sits here chewing her gum. This is Shanda Vander Ark who is currently on trial for the passing of her 15 year old child that was found weighing 69 pounds surrounded by soiled adult diapers. His passing was determined to be from malnutrition and signs of hypothermia. So how does that happen in a home where everyone else is totally okay? Let's go over the last 24 hours of hell that Timothy Ferguson, her son, had to go through at the hands of Shonda and her other son, Paul Ferguson. The day before Timothy's passing, Paul made him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with some eggs, which is a gourmet meal compared to what he was normally fed, bread with hot sauce on it. Timothy was having a very difficult time waking up. So Shonda tells Paul, give him an ice bath. So Paul monitors Timothy in the bath for the first half of the day. Shonda had recently passed the bar and was working at a courthouse, so he had to watch him. Shonda even had Paul make him pizza rolls to hold in front of him. And when he would reach out for it, he would pull it away from him. And later on in the day, Shonda takes over. Timothy spends nine hours, nine hours in this bath. The following Morning, she finds out that Timothy is not breathing and she tells Paul, I don't want to call 9 1 1. She waits 20 minutes and finally decides to call. She tells a 9 1 1 operator to hold on a minute. She needs to get Timothy out of the bed. But Timothy wasn't laying in a bed. He didn't even have a bed. He slept on a closet floor on a blue tarp. Timothy had nothing on but an adult diaper. So she has Paul get him dressed to be presentable for the cops. The police arrive and she already has a story that Timothy was on a hunger strike because of all the life stress that they currently had. Her husband earlier in the year had had a stroke and because they had stairs, he had to move in with his parents because he just physically could not live in that home. So now she's having to do everything by herself. She had to go to law school by herself and pass the bar by herself. And now she has a job and she's taking care of everything by herself and she's exhausted. When the police get there, they immediately notice how frail and thin Timothy is. They also notice police grade leg cuffs, that there's hot sauce in the bathroom and that all the food sources in the house are locked up and there are cameras everywhere. There was even a motion sensor camera in the bathroom. There was no privacy in this home.

When she went to turn off the light, she was horrified to discover three burglars had already sneaked into the house. Realising the danger, Daisy quickly used water to wake her daughter. The moment they ran out, they collided with one of the thieves. Where you going? Huh? Daisy hurriedly pulled her daughter into the elevator. The thief was blocked outside. The two thought they had made a clean escape, unaware that a thief was already waiting downstairs. But he found the elevator door wouldn't open, forcing him to watch them ascend. He quickly ran to the first floor, only to realize the elevator never came down. It turned out Daisy had hit the emergency button and returned to the second floor. Remembering there was a panic room there, Daisy rushed with her daughter toward the panic room, managing to hide inside just in the nick of time. The enraged thieves started pounding on the door from the outside. Daisy and her daughter could only sit fearfully in the corner. Fortunately, the steel door was solid. Daisy picked up the phone to call the police, only to realize the panic room's phone line wasn't connected. As Daisy panicked, her daughter noticed the intercom button in the security room. She told her mother to use the intercom to scare the thieves. But the thieves weren't fazed at all, as they Had already cut the phone lines. The thief demanded that if she handed over the safe key, they would leave immediately. Daisy knew it was a trap. The thieves were enraged by Daisy's refusal.

Él y milhouse liberaron una pelota, atrapando a los maestros contra la puerta. Después de eso, jugó con el auto del director y ató globos al motor. Justo cuando los niños elogiaban a bart, el director apareció detrás de él exigiendo que le entregara el motor. Tú eres el jefe. El director castigó a bart haciéndolo limpiar el tobogán y luego lo llevó de vuelta a la oficina para darle una charla. Reconoció que las bromas de bart eran ingeniosas, pero dijo que bart no era el mejor bromista que había visto. Hay alguien aún mejor. Espera. Espera, dijo bart. Si hay alguien peor, tengo que saber quién es. Es una chica, respondió el director, pero se negó a decir quién, así que bart no tuvo más opción que hurgar en los archivos de la escuela. Pronto encontró algo extraño de hace diez años. El periódico escolar no se había publicado durante dos semanas completas. Antes de ese descanso, el director estaba alegre. Después, de repente, se volvió serio y maduro. Justo entonces, lisa vio a willy en un rincón. Cuando bart lo presionó por respuestas. Willy contó la historia. Hace diez años. Springfield elementery tenía una piscina. El director de aquel entonces adoraba nadar. Un día subió al trampolín Como de costumbre, pero olvidó revisar la piscina. Primero, cuando dio la espalda y saltó, se dio cuenta de que el agua había sido reemplazada por gusano.

This guy just found a random rock, painted it red, sprinkled a few coins around it, and boom, a new deity was born. In no time, people were lining up to donate money and pray. Some even bowed down in deep reverence. In just 10 minutes, the pile of coins multiplied by 10 times. While using religion to scam people is nothing new in India. Even this alien dude got totally ripped off. His name is Jack, and he came to earth a year ago in his spaceship to do some research. But as soon as he landed, he got mugged. This old geezer saw Jack's necklace and figured it must be worth a pretty penny. He snatched it right off Jack's neck and then quickly hopped on a train, fading into the distance. This was Bad News Bears. That necklace was actually the remote control for Jack's spaceship. Without it, he was stranded on earth. But since it was his first time here, he didn't know squat. So he started observing. He noticed that everyone was wearing clothes, so he swiped a couple of outfits from a car, thinking he could finally blend in with the crowd. But he couldn't figure out why everyone was laughing at him. It was only after trying on a few different get UPS that he gradually realized clothes were gender specific. Then Jack discovered something else. Pieces of paper with an old dude's picture on Them. Amazingly, you could trade these papers for stuff, and getting your hands on them wasn't too hard. You could snag them from clothes in parked cars, or get them from the blind folks on the overpass. Now that he had food and clothes sorted out, there was still one big problem left. The language barrier. Like, he could see that this one guy's clothes were a bit off, but he couldn't tell him. All he could do was personally help him adjust them. But the dude seemed pretty ticked off. Had Jack messed with his fashion sense. On the way back, a kind hearted driver took Jack in. But Jack kept staring at the driver intensely. Then out of nowhere, he grabbed the guy's hand. The driver was so freaked out, he hit the brakes immediately. The thing is, by holding his hand, Jack was actually trying to acquire language skills, because on his planet, people have this unique ability. Just by holding someone's hand, they can gain all of that person's skills. So will he eventually find his remote control? The name of this hilarious movie is PK the Alien Fool.

She knew exactly what she was doing, but she couldn't stop eating. Slowly, the woman grew more and more depressed. Her body also became weaker and weaker. One day, she was on an important shoot.

The partnership was immediately terminated. In embarrassment, the woman quickly ducked into the restroom. Finally, she went back to the Chinese doctor. She begged him to remove the tapeworm. The doctor took Out a bottle of medicine and told the woman to drink it. Then she lay down in the bathtub. The tapeworm crawled out of her body. She pulled it out with all her might, but the tapeworm didn't he want to leave her body. Just when the woman was in despair, she's friend suddenly opened the door.

If he could blow out the front left tire, the target would lose control and smash into the car next to him. The next day, Jack set up his rifle and waited for the target. The Mark appeared quickly. Just as he was about to fire, he suddenly saw a mother and child step out. He didn't have time to think. He fired the shot in the final moment before the target drove out of range. Look out! But the burst of flame from the explosion engulfed the woman he had just seen. Jack was devastated that his mistake had killed an innocent person. He returned home and broke down crying. This was the first time he had made a mistake in his 50 years as an assassin. He was consumed by guilt. He went to his boss and asked to retire. Surprisingly, the demanding boss readily agreed. However, the boss said he had one last mission to complete before retiring. Jack reluctantly accepted. This time there was no photo, only a piece of paper with the Target's 5:00 appearance at a coffee shop and the two words White River After reading it, Jack tossed the note into the fire. He quickly arrived at the coffee shop. Jack used his phone to snap pictures of every license plate outside, then cautiously entered the store. He found a seat where he could clearly see everyone and began observing the people present. Next, Jack used those license plates to run background checks on everyone. 5:00 soon arrived. Just then, a woman suddenly stood up and walked toward him. Jack calmly moved his hand toward his weapon.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Sink! I've got a white girlfriend, but she almost killed me. We'd only been dating for four months when she said she wanted me to meet her parents. At first they seemed super welcoming, polite, friendly. But pretty soon I started noticing weird shit. They had two black housekeepers. The woman smiled like something straight out of a horror movie. The guy stone cold stared at me like I owed him money. I told my girl I wanted to leave. Right then and there. A bunch of guests started showing up. Apparently it was some annual private party. Everyone who showed up was white and rich. Like, insanely rich. The whole vibe was off. I was the only black person there. They were weirdly hyped to meet me, kept complimenting how strong I looked, how handsome. Something felt off. I pulled out my camera, figured I'd take some pics to chill myself out. Then I saw another black guy. Finally, a familiar face. I rushed over, said, hey, but he looked vacant. His eyes were empty, his body stiff. We barely got a few words in before this old white woman walked up all over him like they were dating. I tried giving him a classic fist bump. He shook my hand instead. I froze. This dude looked black, but everything else about him felt white. I headed back inside, confused as hell. Tried to plug in my phone. Cord was yanked out. That freaky maid popped up without a sound.

His parents were also encouraging him, explaining how to fly. The man raised his arms but could not fly. The man took the advice, took two steps back, and rushed forward with excitement. However, he ultimately failed to turn into Superman. Seeing his failure, he turned and left angrily. On the way, he met a few boys who laughed at him when they saw his costume. The man shouted, I am the real Superman! The boys laughed and said, then fly and show us! The boy held up two fingers and his body actually rose slightly. Seeing this, the children ran away in a panic. At that moment, his parents happened to arrive and were overjoyed to see their son flying. The man was stunned this was actually happening. A moment later, he held up his fingers again and immediately soared into the sky. But he had not yet mastered the correct way to fly. As he flew higher and higher, he accidentally startled a flock of birds and then quickly plunged into the sea. When he surfaced, he asked a passerby in Mallorca. The man realized he was far from home and immediately took off again. Soon, the man fell into another strange place. The person thought he was an alien. The boy quickly asked him for directions and the person pointed the way for him. The boy took off again. His fear had now disappeared. And he enjoyed soaring through the clouds. However, when he landed, several fake Batman and Spider Man suddenly appeared. He started beating the man without a word, thinking he was just a normal person. But the boy punched and the fake hero was thrown far away. Seeing this, the fake Spider Man pulled out a sword. The boy took the opportunity to take off and successfully returned home.

The infected can only tearfully beg for mercy, as if something more terrifying than death lurks within. Yet for the safety of the majority, the crowd still forces them inside with cold resolve. As the heavy stone door slowly closes. No one survives the night inside until the next day, when the gates open once more. Then the swiftest runners would enter, while beyond the high walls lay an endless labyrinth. These runners were the camp's sole hope. Only through the maze maps they charted could the others find a way out. But today felt strangely off. Usually the runners emerged before sunset, yet today their figures remained absent. Some began to speculate. Perhaps they had been slain by the labyrinth's monsters. Each gust of wind whipping through the passage signalled the stone gate's imminent closure. Just as despair threatened to overwhelm them, Mike suddenly pointed toward the labyrinth's steps. There, runner minus staggered toward the exit, carrying the wounded captain on his back. Minus was utterly exhausted, and the gate was closing fast. Mike scrambled through the closing gap. Though he squeezed in, minus couldn't fathom this reckless act. Realizing Mike was new here, minus explained the danger. The captain had been attacked by lurking monsters and was showing signs of infection. Night was falling, and the beasts would soon emerge in full force. Nino wanted to find Cover first. But Mike insisted on hiding the captain. Suddenly, Mike spotted a hanging vine. They could use it to suspend the captain in midair and save his life. Just then, a bone chilling scraping sound echoed. A massive monster appeared. Driven by pure survival instinct.

But when Mike came home from school, he found the tape still firmly in place. Clearly, no one was home. Yet at midnight sharp, the sound of meat being chopped echoed from next door. Mike wondered if the neighbor had returned home. But when he rushed out to check, he found no sign the tape had been removed. If no one was home, where was the noise coming from? As this pattern repeated day after day, Mike gradually sensed something was terribly wrong. Whenever he opened his window, a bloody stench would waft in, making him wretch uncontrollably each time he smelled it. Even stranger, several stray cats always gathered near the neighbor's door, as if awaiting some special feeding. Driven by suspicion, Mike began monitoring his neighbor. Two weeks passed without a single sighting. But just that day, upon returning home from school, he suddenly saw light in his room. Thinking someone had broken in, he rushed upstairs. He searched every corner of the apartment, yet found nothing suspicious. Knowing he couldn't have been mistaken. So he turned off the lights to create the illusion of absence. He waited silently in the darkness. When midnight struck, the sound of chopping meat echoed as punctually as ever. Yet here there was no movement. Just as Mike was about to give up, several stray cats flashed across the window. So disgusted by their unsanitary habit of Defecating anywhere, Mike initially planned to get rid of them, but then an idea struck him. He collected samples in plastic bags and rushed them to a friend for testing that very night. The results, however, left him deeply disappointed. The feline experiment showed no abnormalities whatsoever. Yet Mike refused to lower his guard. Days of torment

What kind of person he becomes is as random as opening a blind box. Sometimes it's a man, sometimes a woman. He even turns into an old man or a child. As his appearance changes, his voice and eyesight will also change. First thing Jack does when he wakes up is to choose the right clothes and shoes according to his appearance. But no matter how much his appearance changed, there was only one soul inside. He graduated from college and became a furniture designer. And with his best friend, he runs a private, customized furniture store. He earns a million dollars a year without leaving his home with his unique design concepts. And Tom was the only one who knew his secret and wasn't scared off. Whenever Jack became a beautiful woman, Tom would invite him to spend the night. But Jack refused every time. One day, Jack met a beautiful sales girl at a furniture store. He was captivated by her sweet smile. But his appearance only lasted a day. He couldn't have a relationship. So Jack pretended to buy furniture under a different identity every day. Anna patiently introduced him to the furniture each time. Jack gradually found himself falling in love with her. But to Anna, he was just a stranger. Who came to buy furniture. So he decided to confess his love to her when he became a handsome man. After a month of waiting, Jack finally became a handsome man. He couldn't wait to get to the furniture store and buy a chair. Anna enthusiastically helped him load it into his car. Just as she turned to leave, Jack called out to her nervously. He asked Anna if we could have dinner together. Anna laughed at the suddenness of the conversation. She smiled at Jack's invitation and declined. So he plucked up the courage to confess his love for her. He said he'd been in like with her for a long time. He I hope that Anna would give him a chance. Looking at Jack's sincere eyes, Anna said yes. In the evening, they went to Jack's atelier. When she Learned that Jack was a furniture designer, her feelings for him immediately grew. The two of them ate sushi happily. The air was filled with the sweet smell of love. They found out that they had similar interests, so they agreed to have dinner together again tomorrow. When Jack got home, he set a dozen alarms and drank eight cups of coffee with the anticipation of the next day's date. He survived the first night. Soon they met again. They were like a couple in love with happy smiles on their faces. And their relationship was heating up fast. The power of love carried Jack through the second night. On the third day, he took Anna shopping. By the end of the night, Jack was yawning with exhaustion. He knew he might not make it, but he couldn't leave Anna. So he invited Anna to breakfast tomorrow. On the subway back, Jack couldn't hold out any longer. He accidentally dozed off. But when he woke up again, he found himself in the form of a scruffy old man.

This was stolen cash they obtained through robbery. The only way to smuggle this money out was through this method, crude yet brutally effective. The remaining cash was hidden by Anna against her chest. Pretending to be pregnant, Anna and Jack then entered the airport separately. Anna checked in first. After clearing the counter, he slowly headed toward the elevators. Only after boarding the elevator did she turn to look at Jack. But she didn't expect Jack to be stopped by security. It turned out this was his first time using a passport. Security questioned him about the purpose of his trip abroad. As more people gathered around, Jack forced himself to stay calm while answering their questions. Anna felt a surge of anxiety, but she couldn't turn back. She had to trust Jack's quick thinking. Luckily, Jack remained composed and handled every question successfully. Passing the security interrogation, next came the checkpoint they both dreaded. If they failed here, their plan would collapse. As Anna walked through the metal detector, it suddenly beeped. Jack's heart instantly leaped into his throat. He stared at Anna for a long moment, forcing himself to look away to avoid suspicion. Anna removed her necklace and went through the scanner again. This time the machine stayed silent. Jack moved directly behind Anna. Only then did they both exhale in relief. They hurried toward the boarding gate and finally exchanged smiles, thrilled they'd escaped.

The captain rushed back to the interrogation room, where only the female officer remained. He mobilized the entire station, searching every corner of the building. They opened every vehicle trunk, but the suspect was nowhere to be found. The captain issued a full scale search order, deploying everyone inside the station. Yet they still couldn't locate the suspect. The captain stopped the car. The female officer realized only the trunk of the captain's official vehicle had not been searched. She signaled to the captain, who slowly reached for his holstered pistol. In that instant, as a tram approached, the suspect leapt out of the car. Using the tram as cover, he blocked the pursuing officers. He had completely evaded capture.

This guy actually crushed a dragon egg. At first, he didn't care at all. But when he tried to retract his foot, he suddenly heard a dragon's roar from behind. Seeing this, he was terrified. But to my shock, the dragon didn't harm him. Instead, the Silverwing dragon simply toyed with him. This man was named IRF, a rather ungraceful drunkard. No one expected that he actually had Targaryen blood. The Silverwing dragon, highly sensitive, sensed that bloodline and stopped bothering him. It took a few steps back, lowering its proud head. Seeing this, wolf was both surprised and delighted. He never expected that a man like him, who had achieved nothing, could one day become a dragon rider. Excited, he rushed out of the dragon's lair and flew recklessly over King's Landing. By now, the soldiers and citizens below were terrified, thinking the Queen Ranera had sent someone to attack. Seeing this, the king's representative, Amon, immediately mounted his horse and left the palace. He quickly found Vgorghar, thinking that this dragon rider must pay a price. But Wolff realized something was wrong and immediately changed course, flying away from King's Landing. However, Vorghar kept relentlessly pursuing him. In the end, they reached Dragonstone as the largest living dragon.

On one side lives the warm fairy, on the other dwells the winter fairy. These two are twin sisters, yet vast climatic differences keep them apart. To let her sister visit warm forest, Tinkerbell and her friends worked through the night to build a snowmaking machine. Her sister brought a large block of ice. Simply place the ice on the machine, and with the artificial engine, artificial snowmaking would be complete. This way, her wings wouldn't melt. Seeing the unfamiliar warm forest for the first time, she felt utterly curious. The fairies had prepared a special surprise for her. First to appear was Silver Mist, who drew a column of water from beneath the sea. Fish greeted the younger sister warmly, iridescent crafted a beautiful rainbow bridge. Wherever Rosetta passed, flowers burst into bloom. Fawn released thousands upon thousands of butterflies. She had never witnessed such a sight before. Dancing with joy, the fairies all came out to greet the new friend. But the younger sister had already begun wiping sweat from her brow. The scorching heat of the warm forest had left her utterly drained, her wings nearly melting away. With the ice nearly depleted, they had to rush her to the winter forest at once. Lord Millory of the winter Forest arrived just in time. He helped her up and gently guided her to spread her wings. Thankfully, her wings returned to normal. Okay, your wings are okay? Yeah. Yeah. Lord Millory Commanded the younger sister, she was forbidden to set foot in the Warm Forest again. This meant Tinkerbell would never see her again. Just as she tried to chase after Lord Millory to revoke the order, Queen Clarion of the Warm Forest called her back. The two of them seemed like familiar strangers, it turns out.

Everyone is tense, afraid of any more accidents. Whether Charlie succeeds or not, they must pull him back up in two minutes. Fortunately, Charlie quickly reaches Jack. He takes out the safety harness, fastens it onto Jack, and immediately kicks the pipe. Mark immediately tightens the rope. After a frantic operation, the two Are pulled up.

Unlike Hans, who was reserved, Jack was outspoken and the troublemaker of the school. At that time, Taiwan had just lifted martial law, but the school still retained many of the disciplinary measures from that period, including searches of students personal belongings, and corporal punishment. One day, Jack boldly followed a campus monitor who was carrying a stick on his rounds. After the monitor left, Hans felt uneasy, but Jack just laughed it off, not caring at all. That evening, Hans's roommate took him out to meet a girl. Despite the girl's advances, Hans felt uncomfortable and resistant. At this point, Hans hadn't yet realized that he was different from others. The next day in vocal class, the priest told the students to treat their instruments like lovers.

Hans couldn't help but glance at Jack, only to find Jack was looking right back at him. Flustered, Hans quickly looked away, his heart racing as a strange feeling stirred within him. When Hans returned to the dorm that night, he found Jack being punished. It turned out that Jack had been caught sneaking in a late night snack. Later, while Jack was taking a shower, Hans brought him some ointment. Just then, someone came into the room and the two quickly hid together. It was Hans roommate who was bullying a younger student. The student was being violently stripped of his pants, and one of the bullies even pulled out a lighter. Jack wanted to intervene, but Hans stopped him. The commotion drew attention and to protect Jack, Hans stepped out into the open. His roommate pressured him to join the bullying. As Hans hesitated, holding a stick, Jack appeared and stopped.

Krusty the clown is holding a press conference announcing plans to change the genders of the cat and mouse from male to female. Oh, my god! What? Bart and his male friends think it's completely unnecessary. But crusty insists that female power must be recognized. The female attendees express agreement and excitement. Bart and his friends walk out of the conference disappointed and mocked this brainless decision. Bart even organized everyone to host a boycott party against the female version. Soon, Bart set up the party scene at home. Homer, worried Bart might resist too strongly, warned him that the more he disliked things, the more he'd end up like Abe. The party began almost immediately, before the opening credits had even finished. Now sit in silence till it's over. Blindfolds on, gentlemen. Meanwhile, Lisa set up her phone, ready to capture this historic moment. Lisa turned on the TV to watch the female version of cat and mouse. Just as she was laughing hysterically, Bart appeared behind her. He was also engrossed in the show, laughing even louder than Lisa. I knew you couldn't resist watching, and guess what? You laughed! It was funny! Bart was speechless. He mumbled a messy excuse and dashed out, returning to the Resistance League. His unsuspecting friends continued to praise Bart. Bart even put on a righteous front, declaring he absolutely refused to watch the female version of cat and mouse. Little Did he know Lisa witnessed his hypocrisy? She decided to take the video she just recorded and upload it online to expose Bart's lies. The next morning, Homer was watching the morning news on the couch when suddenly Bart appeared on the screen. He hurriedly called Bart over to watch together. Facing Homer's mockery, Bart felt utterly bitter inside. Well, Bart, how does it feel to be trolled? Mean Jeff? And dare I say, when confronted by Lisa, Bart shrugged it off, convinced his reputation wouldn't be tarnished by such a minor incident. What he didn't expect was to be immediately surrounded and condemned by his classmates. Bart scrambled to defend himself, but the students wouldn't listen. Millhouse even tried to seize power at that moment. Next thing I say, perfectly chosen to show I am worthy of leadership. Get him! Bart panicked and fled. Faced with the relentless pursuit of his classmates, he ran into the girls restroom. But unexpectedly, three sixth grade girls were already inside. Facing them, even though he was a boy, Bart felt like a little kid. So the older girls toyed with him mercilessly. Just then, his backpack fell to the floor. Pink spray paint spilled everywhere. It turned out they were planning to use this paint to prank the principal. Seeing their plan exposed, they began threatening Bart. To avoid further bullying, Bart promised he wouldn't tell anyone. He even offered worse ideas to help them. Thus, Bart temporarily gained the trust of The three older girls. Oh! Homemade prank masks. The three girls carried out their mischief while Bart acted as their lookout. The operation concluded perfectly. The group returned to their secret base. Seeing Bart still following them, they tried to shoot him away. But Bart declared he wanted to join their group. They explained their organization's radical ideology, hoping to dissuade him. Hearing this only made Bart more determined to join. However, he needed to pass a small test. Steal the principal's cell phone. Work or personal dinner? Welcome to girlhood. Next, the four sisters rampaged through Springfield, spreading feminist propaganda everywhere. Their actions quickly caused a sensation. They were featured on the news. Upon hearing this, Lisa praised the group. Fueled by the praise, Bart became even more smug. Seeing Bart like this, Lisa grew suspicious. She even caught a few clue. Ah! What, are you in Bossy Riot? No way, huh? Good. Because if you were fighting for women's rights, it would destroy my entire vision of the universe. Actually, I totally am. Lisa couldn't understand why Bart would become a feminist activist. She felt Bart didn't truly understand feminism. Bart admitted he didn't fully grasp it, but in his eyes, it was enough that it was cool. He even invited Lisa to join them. Though tempted, Lisa still felt some fear deep down. Later, Bart arrived at the secret base to inquire about tonight's covert operation. But the sisters delivered bad news. A male supremacist group LED By Millhouse was staging a full scale protest against Shell's performance. Under pressure, shell reluctantly decided not to air the female version of cat and mouse. So they set out to destroy all master tapes of cat and mouse. But this crazy plan was shot down by Bart. Yet Bart's loan resistance meant nothing. Oh, you can't let us don't have a lady cow. All cows are ladies. After an unknown amount of time, Lisa found Bart tied up using her phone. Before she could tease him. She was shocked by his bad news, so Lisa hurriedly took Bart to the scene. Meanwhile, crusty was at the press conference announcing the removal of the female version of cat and mouse. The siblings arrived at the scene just then. Sneaking into the archive room, they found the custodian bound and gagged. It seemed they were too late. The room had already been taken over by three girls. They were about to dump the master tapes of cat and mouse into a VAT of pink nail polish. This act truly terrified everyone present. That's crazy. We have those backed up a thousand times. Right, Howard, what do you do? Just then, the siblings arrived on the scene to stop them. But at that very moment, the bag fell to the ground. Lisa hurriedly kicked away the cart holding the nail polish. Yet the polish spilled all over the area beneath the audience seats. The pungent fumes instantly made the boys sob uncontrollably. Seeing this, the trio pulled out glitter and showered it over them. Milhouse, the ring leader, was even tossed into a wrecked car by the gang members. Seizing the chance, the three fled. By the time security caught up, they had already changed into adorable outfits, and just like that, they escaped unscathed. In the end, Bart chose to quit the sorority. The rowdy bullies then set their sights on Lisa, who had just shown such courage, extending her an invitation to join. Lisa hesitated for a moment before deciding to join.

Not only could he sit in front of a temple and beg with honour and earn three times as much as other people, even when he crosses the street there are kind people to help him. He can even live in a government supplied room for free as a blind man. But that's not his limit. He uses his status as a pianist to play the piano in other people's homes, cause no one would be afraid of a blind man. So he could often spy on the privacy of many hostesses. But he didn't know that pretending to be blind would become the most regretted thing in his life. That that day he went to celebrate the birthday of a rich man's wife.

But Jack had already taken a deposit from the tycoon and there was a sizable balance due at the end of the show. Certainly couldn't have gotten the time wrong. While they were arguing, the noise attracted the attention of an elderly neighbor woman. The woman didn't seem to want to attract the neighbor's attention, so she let him in. After ascertaining that Jack was truly blind, the woman let him play the piano, but he was shocked by what he saw. Because there was a dead body lying in the living room, he finally realised why the woman didn't want to let him in. But he can't show that he's nervous. He could only excuse himself to go to the bathroom. When he passed by the living room, in order to make himself look more like a blind man, he deliberately stepped on the blood on the floor. He thought that going to the bathroom would help him calm down. But he didn't expect that this is the most horrible place because the murderer was hiding behind him with a gun.

When the boss opened the safe to retrieve his belongings, Laura, who was hiding in the corner, used binoculars to write down the combination to the safe. After the boss left, she opened the safe and found the combination to the diamond vault was indeed here. But the next day, when they were about to take action, an accident occurred.

But soon a look of horror came over her because two bright red eyes appeared behind the dark colored glass. Then the car door opened without warning. Before the girl could react, she was pulled into the car by a mysterious force. After about 10 hours, the girl gradually woke up but found herself in an underground labyrinth surrounded by dark coloured earth walls and lights that flickered on and off. It was all very eerie and the only useful clue she had was a maze shaped game cube. She was hungry and thirsty and she was filled with fear. But with the instinct to survive, she started trying to solve the GameCube's puzzles. Soon the first puzzle was solved. She heard the sound of a lock being opened. The girl plucked up the courage to push open the door. She saw a takeout bag on the floor. Inside was a fresh burger. The girl was starving. She devoured it. Then she successfully solved the second puzzle. This time there appeared a clean bed. It was only then that she realised that she was involved in a cruel game of captivity. Only when she solved these puzzles, the unseen kidnappers would give her what she needed to survive. But as time went on, the questions became more and more difficult. And the only thing worse than hunger in the labyrinth is thirst. She searched high and Low, all she found was a filthy toilet. In order to survive, she can only endure the nausea and drink the sewage inside. The girl was devastated. She threw the game cube in anger. But then she regretted it. After all, it was her only hope for survival. So she grabbed it in her hand again and apologized and begged to the kidnapper, who was hiding behind the curtain. As if hearing her please, a small bottle of clean water appeared in front of the girl. This went on for a month. That day, the girl suddenly heard a faint cry. Following the sound, she found a door. She wanted to comfort those who were being held inside, but she found a slip of paper with a code written on it. She dialed the combination according to the numbers on it. The door was opened. She carefully pushed it open, only to see a girl about her age with her hands behind her back. But what the girl said next shocked her.

First, they use a cutting machine to shave down her toenails that were thicker than a foam book. Then they slather wax all all over her fluffy back like spreading Nutella on toast before yanking off all the hair and skin. This was just the warmed up. Next, they drill holes into her body and vacuum out every ounce of fat, leaving her looking like a deflated balloon. After a few hours, voila! The 500 pound fat girl has transformed into a stunning 90 pound babe. With her newfound confidence, Julie entered a dating show where her dreamy blonde man awaited. After a series of rounds, Julie emerged as the final contestant. The blond man strolled up to her holding a bouquet of flowers and declared his love. Julie didn't hesitate for a second and blurted out yes! Yes! A million times yes! They were the perfect match, like peanut butter and jelly. So the man decided to propose to Julie on the spot. Julie agreed without hesitation. Just when the two thought they would live a happy life from then on, an accident happened. While trying on the wedding dress, Julie suddenly felt unwell and her body kept swelling. She quickly hid in the bathroom and then found that she had changed back to her original appearance.

So he tried to pry into the girl's privacy. But the cell phone was completely locked up due to repeated password errors. But an evil plan came to his mind. Smashed the cell phone against the corner of the table. Then he opened the cover of the cell phone. In no time, he removed the motherboard and installed a bug inside. Then he used voice changing software to pretend to be a woman and called the owner. He said he found your cell phone, but the screen is broken. It's been sent to a repair store. He asked the girl to pick it up. Anna was unprepared. She went to the designated place alone. The hallways here are long and dark. It didn't look like anyone lived there. But as soon as she opened the door, she saw her missing cell phone. The screen of the phone was indeed broken and unusable. The clerk took out a form and asked Anna to fill in her information. She didn't know that the clerk was the man who found her phone. Anna didn't think twice about writing down her cell phone's password. The clerk then managed to open the phone. But in the name of repairing the phone, he secretly implanted a virus program in it and then synchronized all the information to his own phone. Anna was very satisfied with her new cell phone. What she didn't know was that the danger had just begun. Just after Anna left, the man's cell phone lit up. Then all her operations were exposed to the man. Even the camera could be controlled at will. The man's plan was successful. In the days that followed, Anna's privacy was all known to the man. He soon found out Anna's hobbies and habits. Even knew how much money was left on her card. Now he knew everything about Anna. He was most interested in such a bright and sunny girl. Destroying this kind of beauty is the only way to satisfy the man's perverted mind. By analysing the information, he identified the three people Anna cared most about. Her father, her best friend and the boss of the company. Then she wrote the number nine in front of Anna's name. That means Anna will be the ninth girl to die because of a missing cell phone.

Without a doubt, her score is zero. She acted so stubbornly to stand up for her fellow competitor. The third girl came up in front of everyone. She didn't run. Instead, she started to walk like a model on the trampoline. She boldly revealed her bra straps. Then she lightly touched the platform with her fingers. The judge was dumbfounded.

She planned to use the steel pipe to break the handcuffs on the door handle. Not only did this fail, but she also crashed into the car behind her.

Um, okay, most of you were lost on optimal polynomials on the last quiz. Uh, so once you choose the degree and domain of the polynomial, the polynomials chose minimize your worst case error. So the goal here is to minimize the maximum probability of p of x minus f of x where f of x is the actual function here. Uh, p of x is the approximate polynomial max varies over the chosen intervals. Now for well behaved function there's always an nth degree polynomial take you to an error curve that oscillates back and forth positive epsilon and negative the value of n plus two times bring you back to your error of epsilon. You got it. It's possible to make contrived functions f for x which no such polynomial exists, but these rarely occur in practice. Thank you Mr Gallagher. Now who knows what Mr Galgar almost got to? Uh, Chevy, Chevy Palomino approximate.

When the teacher suddenly turns around. The boy freezes, thinking he's been caught. But she only greets someone behind him. Mistaking her reaction as silent approval, he grows even bolder. That's when the teacher glances down, spots his hand, and instantly slaps him across the face. The students in the hallway burst into laughter, mocking him mercilessly. Yet this boy's disturbing behavior doesn't end there. He and a friend follow the teacher to a shopping center. Under the pretense of looking for his mom, he begins lifting the curtains of the women's changing rooms one by one. At the final stall, he finally spots his teacher. But the moment she recognizes him, he bolts from the mall. Back in class, the boy can't take his eyes off her. Noticing his stare, the teacher orders him to stand up. He's so transfixed that he doesn't hear her until she repeats the command several times. As he rises, the classmates around him notice the unmistakable bulge in his trousers, sparking another round of humiliating laughter.

Yet just the day before, her limbs had been severed, leaving her lying in a pool of blood, barely clinging to life. At that moment, a boy burst in. The woman haughtily commanded him to save her. The boy picked her up, only to discover her limbs had been cut off. In terror, he flung her away. His trembling voice tried to call for help. The woman revealed she was a vampire. The only way to save her was to drain the boy's blood, meaning he would die. Terrified, the boy began to retreat. Seeing this, the woman panicked.

Fortunately, the junior acted fast and managed to save the husband. But now there was no time to waste. The senior was still under the car, adjusting the weight. Because the tray couldn't hold enough, he had to bear part of the load himself so the three could get out safely. Realizing how dangerous it was, the junior pulled the red control line. They had to start immediately. The first to get out was the boss. Go! The boss got out safely. Then it was Daisy's turn. But at that tense moment, her son froze in fear. He stood still, unable to Move! The senior under the car was already exhausted. Part of the car's weight was on his body. Seeing this, the boss rushed over and told the boy, if he got hurt, his mom, Daisy would never forgive herself. After those heartfelt words, the boy finally stepped out of the car. Everyone was saved at last. Only the senior remained struggling. Hundreds of pounds of pressure were on his body. If he let go, the car could explode any second. There was no time to wait for backup. His strength was completely gone. In the end, the senior let go with a massive explosion. He died in the underground garage.

One day, just as he was about to cut the string of a girl, she suddenly opened her eyes and sat up. But the man did not panic at all, instead smiled and said that she was in the mortuary and was dead. The girl did not believe it and asked that if I am dead, then how am I saying this? Man took out the death certificate from his pocket and showed that she had died in a car accident. The girl remembered the accident, but she did not remember what happened after that. She kept saying again and again that I am not dead and let me go. But the man, whom everyone called Lao Wang, said to accept death and started stitching the girl's wounds. The surprising thing was that the girl was not feeling any pain. Then Lao Wong injected a yellow medicine and made her unconscious. On the other hand, her mother came to bid farewell and told Lao Wong to make her daughter beautiful. Lao Wong quickly covered the girl with a white sheet so that her mother would not feel anything. When she regained consciousness in the evening, the girl, I e. felt that the heartbeat on her wrist had stopped and she hurt herself. But she did not feel any pain, which shocked her. That is she really Dead, she picked up the phone for help, but the wire was cut and the outside gate was also locked. Then her boyfriend came to see her for the last time, but Lao Wong refused to come inside. Anna heard his voice and started banging the door, but perhaps the morgue was soundproof, so the sound did not go out and the boyfriend left. In anger, she destroyed the room and asked Lao Wong whether he was a human or a ghost. He smiled and said that he has a third eye with which he can see the souls and gives them salvation. Anna now suspected that he is alive and this man is hiding something. One day when Lao Wang went out, Anna picked up Scissors and attacked him, but he survived. She tried to open the door but failed. Then she put Scissors on her neck and threatened to open the door or else she would kill herself. Lao Wang said that if you think you are alive, then kill me. But Anna's hands started trembling and she did not have the courage and he showed her the mirror and asked if she was the same as before. Anna decided to find out the truth and one day she stole her key and started opening the gate. But in the meantime Lao Wong came back. She hid in the nearby room and called her boyfriend from the landline, but could not talk due to poor network and Lao Wong followed her this time. Lao Wong just said that do not have any misconception about him and went away.

When homosexuals know the causes of their condition, they're more able to change their behavior. If they choose to do so. So what causes that condition? My research has shown that an overbearing mother combined with a distant father often influences psychosexual development. A boy longs for a relationship with the father.

She said she had seen the suffering caused by bombs and decided to help the mayor's team investigate. Meanwhile, the senior and junior were still working.

Dad, the door is still sticking. You gotta fix it. That is fixed. What are you doing here? I know I was coming. You gonna be here for Halloween? Would you rather be up at school? Mom knows I hate being at school for Halloween. Don't you guys ever talk? Mom knows I hate talking. Well, don't worry, my Halloween is gonna be great. I am going to a party with Axel and Lexi. I'm gonna be hanging with my brother and best friend. How cool is that? You know, I kind of thought it might be weird and all when they started dating. It's been great. We all go out for Thai food and prompt you board game nights. Plus, whenever Lexi's around, Axel never farts on my head. Well, looks like I'll be staying in on the night of mischief. Oh, there is a party, but I can't go cause Cindy will be there also. I was not invited. Seriously, Rick, why did you ever break up with her? I was in a rut. I want to be free to sow my wild oats to really cut loose. Mike, you gotta see this, do I? I was finally filing the last of the soggy papers from the flood and I found the old deed to our house. So I'm flipping through the disclosure. Statements. Listen, cracked foundation, which we knew. Dangerous wiring, which we knew. And then this disclosure. No. 3, death occurred on the premise.

But right after I left, two cops came running after me. They picked up the box on the ground and found it empty, so they thought the money was still on me, and immediately chased in the direction I ran. Just then, a street cleaner opened the trash can. He realized the money was probably stolen, and an idea popped into his head. Meanwhile, I was still trying to find a way not to get caught, when I saw a beggar by the roadside. I quickly jumped next to him, grabbed some trash nearby and dumped it on myself, then pulled the beggar's clothes over my head. By the time I finished disguising myself, the cops arrived, but they didn't recognize me. Instead, they even asked me for directions. I casually pointed somewhere and sent them away. After they left, I happily ran back to get the money. But when I opened the can, the money was gone. I kicked the trash can over in anger. Then I saw the street cleaner riding off with the box. I grabbed a kid's bike and chased after him. Soon, Tony got home with the box. He had a seriously ill daughter who needed a lot of money every day for medicine. Just then, there was a loud knock on the door. I pretended to be a downstairs neighbor and said his place was leaking Water. Tony rushed to the bathroom to check. I took the chance to search the room for the box. When Tony came out and saw me, he instantly realized what was going on. I told him I was just here to take back my box because that money belonged to me. But when he refused, I grabbed his daughter's medicine to threaten him. Left with no choice, Tony handed the box over. I thought I finally got my money back, but when I opened it, it was empty again. You said to play with me. Where is the money? The house is surrounded by the policemen. You betrayed me. If you leave the money, they will not incarcerate you. I was ready. No! Just then, two cops burst in. They arrested me on the spot. I tried to explain that Tony had stolen the money. The fact that I'm poor doesn't make me a thief. So why did you give the money to the police? Hmm? Because we actually already had the money. But Tony had already told the police when he found it and agreed to help them catch me. So he had lured me here on purpose. In the end, I could only face justice. But as the cops were leaving, they dropped the money on the floor. Tony quickly called out that they dropped their cash. The cop turned back and said the money wasn't theirs. I don't know what you're talking about. They've threw the money! Into the river. That's. That is probably yours

But I needed the cleaner's help. She agreed right away. Not long after, the two of them came out of the restroom. I took the bread from my brother, and then the performance began.

Soon, the cleaner stood up and told my wife something. I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do. He's gone. My condolences. What? I suggest you contact his lawyer to see if he left a will. My wife pretended to be heartbroken when she heard it, but the moment she turned her head, her expression changed. Before long, my lawyer arrived.

The owner thought that after he scolded the clerk, I would leave, but he did not expect me to demand that he fire her. To stop me from causing more trouble, the owner reluctantly fired the clerk. Only then was I satisfied and picked up the bag and left. I did not expect the owner to have already locked the Door. I froze on the spot. I did not expect that when I walked into the store, they recognized me as someone involved in multiple shop scams, so they secretly switched the QR codes. Then the owner took out his phone and transferred all the money I had scammed away. Seeing my plan exposed, I was furious. But I was still a fraudster at that moment, so I could only put on sunglasses and walk away with the items.

I looked down at the glass I'd just drunk from and instantly realized someone had poisoned it. Sure enough, my body started to react. Ignoring the ongoing game, I grabbed my water glass and ran to the restroom. I filled it to the brim with water and gulped it down in big swallows. I hoped to dilute the poison in my system, but it didn't work at all. The toxin was stronger than I expected. Stumbling out of the restroom, I barely dodged speeding cars and made it straight to my car's passenger seat. I opened the glove box and pulled out my device. One end connected to my phone, the other went into my vein. Within seconds, my vitals were transmitted to headquarters. The team there immediately panicked. My heart rate was dangerously close to flatlining. They ran a quick analysis and told me to grab the backup defibrillator. I placed the pads on my chest. The trick? You attack a Guardian digitalis bond. Don't push the red button yet. Do you hear me? Don't push it yet. His heart's gonna stop. Take the blue combipen bond mid neck into the vein. I will counteract the digitalis. Injected the serum, but my condition didn't improve. Seeing my stats drop Fast, HQ urged me to press the defibrillator button. No matter how hard I pressed, nothing happened. Bond, push the damn button! Do it now! That's when I realized the wire was disconnected. I tried to reattach it, but the next second, my heart stopped and I collapsed. Luckily, my girlfriend showed up just in time. She reconnected the wire and hit the button without hesitation. Her quick move pulled me back from the edge of death. She wanted to take me to the hospital for a full checkup. I agreed. But before that, there was one thing I had to do. Go back to the casino and finish the game I started. When my opponent saw me walk back in, his face froze in disbelief. He never expected me to still be alive.

The nanny originally came to take care of my sick mother, but she ended up becoming my stepmother. Ever since she entered our home, strange things started happening one after another. I was always healthy before, but recently I've been having frequent stomach pains. Our usually gentle dog barks non stop whenever it sees the Danny. All these unusual signs made me suspicious. What exactly is this woman hiding? What puzzled me even more was this. My sick mother loved having her room filled with sunlight. But whenever my family and I went out, the nanny would deliberately close all the curtains. My mother's condition had been stable, but after the nanny arrived, it rapidly deteriorated until she finally passed away. I knew the nanny was up to something, but I could never find any proof. My mother's funeral, though, I caught a glimpse of a strange smile flashing across the nanny's face. I was certain this woman was trouble. But my father didn't see it that way. Instead, he let this suspicious nanny become my stepmother. One day, while father was still at work, my stepmother made a delicious meal for my brother and me. During dinner, my brother complimented her cooking. He finally showed a satisfied smile. But suddenly, our dog started barking like crazy. Seeing we hadn't finished eating yet, my stepmother offered to take the dog for a walk. When father came Home and saw this scene. He felt really pleased. But a sudden scream made everyone's heart skip a beat. My brother and I rushed outside following the sound. We found our dog covered in blood. My stepmother cried, saying the dog broke free from its and got hit by a speeding truck. Seeing my stepmother's panicked state, father quickly went to comfort her. But rage filled my heart. I didn't believe a word. You did this! You killed them, right? That's enough! Like you killed my mom! Shut up! I finally voiced my suspicions. But before father could stop me, my stomach started hurting severely again. The pain brought me to my knees. They rushed me to the hospital for a complete examination, but the doctors couldn't find anything wrong. Still, I was convinced my stepmother was secretly poisoning me. Father dismissed it completely, thinking I was just paranoid all the time. He said I was acting just like my late uncle who had schizophrenia. That put a weight on my mind. The next day, I searched online for symptoms of schizophrenia. But I didn't feel like anything was wrong with me. I was even more convinced the problem was my stepmother. The next morning, my stepmother brought me a steaming bowl of oatmeal. I sniffed it suspiciously, detecting a strange smell. So I secretly poured the oatmeal into my pencil case and called my friend to meet up. I was planning something important. Then I pretended to finish the Oatmeal. Grabbed my backpack and got ready to leave. Where are you going? Uh, I'm just meeting a friend. That's when my stepmother noticed my backpack was wet on the outside. I quickly said my water bottle was leaking and hurried out the door. My stepmother stared at the white spots on the floor, her face oddly calm. Meanwhile, I met up with my friend, begging him to lend me $300 test if there was poison in the oatmeal. But my friend didn't understand either, thinking I was just paranoid because I'd lost my mother. In my frustration, I tried to show him the oatmeal, but accidentally spilled the evidence. Anger made me yell at my friend. He got scared and ran away. I went home, trying to stay calm. During dinner with the family, father kept praising my stepmother's cooking, but I was convinced my food was poisoned, so I asked to eat the steak from father's plate. My stepmother's expression changed immediately. He said medium rare steak wasn't good for kids, but I insisted on having it. My stepmother finally exploded, saying she couldn't stand me constantly picking fights. Father tried to calm everyone down, but I wasn't listening. I still believe the steak was poisoned. I put the steak in a bag to get it tested. Father tried to stop me. Stop! Look at me! Stop! No! I'm trying to help you! I grabbed a knife and warned him to stay back. My stepmother immediately called the Police, please! That's when I completely lost control. I said my stepmother was a murderer. First she killed my mother, then she killed our dog. And we three would be next. After saying that, I rushed into father and stepmother's bedroom, trying to find evidence of the poisoning. Father, afraid I do something stupid, quickly followed me in, patiently trying to calm me down. Five minutes later, I was already breaking down inside. But that's when my stepmother decided to walk in. My eyes immediately hardened with determination. The police arrived just in time to restrain me. That's what finally made me calm down completely. I realized I'd fallen into my stepmother's trap. But it was all too late. I was criminally detained for hurting my stepmother. Even though I was under 18, I still had to face legal consequences. Father had to hire a top lawyer to defend me. But there was no evidence my stepmother did anything wrong. The lawyer could only suggest I plead insanity. That was the only way to avoid punishment. But I stuck to what I believed and firmly rejected the lawyer's suggestion. That's when my brother walked in, tears streaming down his face, begging me to accept reality.

She generously praised me, but I humiliated her in return. I'm a businessman and I realized that everyone's time is worth something. So now we have enough money to buy a new dress. Lily was speechless for a moment, but my arrogant self thought I was doing her a favor. I told her to forget what happened last night and never contact me again. Soon, I arrived at the company. The boss asked me to meet with an important client and sign a contract. I confidently agreed, but the next second, I was completely shocked. And here's our client, Miss Hubbard. I'd like you to meet our best specialist, pit Lat. I froze on the spot because I never expected Lily to be the company's big client. To keep my job, I had to pretend not to know her, but I messed up from being too nervous. It's hot here, isn't it? Maybe we should turn on the AC. Lily handed me remote control, but the boss said the air conditioner was already on. To cover my embarrassment, I started eating snacks. But even so, Lily didn't let me off. So show is turned. Under Lily's sharp gaze, I had no choice but to painfully present my project, but I kept making mistakes from nerves. Just as the deal was about to fail, the clueless boss stopped Lily. He defended me, saying maybe I just wasn't fully awake. Yet, but Lily knew exactly what I was doing last night, so she refused to accept his excuse. What she didn't expect was that the boss decided to fire me to save the deal. Lily realized that wasn't what she wanted, so she came up with a better idea. I'll sign the contract. Then she handed a note to the boss, then walked toward me as I pretended to be on a call. Yeah, buddy, I'll be in five minutes. Ha, sure. When she saw I was holding the phone upside down, Lily gave a cold smirk and walked away. Then the boss called me into his office. He told me to pack up and go home. I thought I had been fired, but the boss said Lily had given me another chance. So to keep my job, I brought flowers to the place. Lily told me to meet her. I have to tell her something. I was wrong. But my apology didn't move her. She threw a pair of roller skates at me and told me to skate 2 laps with her. But she didn't know I couldn't skate at all. Do you need a hand? No, I'm fine. Why? Whoo, I'm riding. Give me your hand, Mister Izzy. Seeing how clumsy I was, Lily finally reached out her hand to help me and our relationship grew closer. That's when I finally realized my mistake. I sincerely apologized to Lily, but what I didn't expect was that just as I tried to get closer. Lily slipped $300 into my pocket.

When I arrived at the coffee shop, I didn't expect him to start laughing. He ordered a cup of coffee, but I went straight for a bottle of beer. What he didn't expect was that I just opened the beer and started drinking it. I did this hoping to scare him off, but to my surprise, he also picked up a whole bottle of beer and started drinking it. I was so embarrassed, so I quickly said that I'm a modern woman who doesn't do housework and doesn't plan on having kids. Just when I thought I was winning, Tony said we were actually very compatible because the things I don't like, he doesn't like either. I was stunned. I couldn't believe his thoughts were the same as mine. With no other choice, I decided to change my plan. I took him to a rough and dirty street food market. The utensils were dirty with leftover food, and there were cockroaches freely crawling on the table. The waiter even stuck his hand straight into the soup. Tony seemed a bit panicked by the filthy environment. I secretly felt pleased because I thought a rich guy like Tony would never be able to handle this. I thought my plan was finally working, so I happily started eating. But to my surprise, Tony smiled faintly and poured some Sauce into the soup and stirred it. Then he started eating just like me. I was completely shocked. I couldn't believe he was okay with this, so I decided to pull out my secret weapon. I then took him to a mall, thinking I could make him dislike me by wasting money. I ran into a luxury store and started shopping. I even asked the sales assistant to bring out the store's prized collection. But Tony told me not to worry about the price. As I casually picked up a handbag, I saw that it cost as much as three months of my salary. I was so scared that I quickly put it back. So I decided to check out other items, and to my surprise, he smiled at me warmly.

But what I didn't expect was David holding a pregnancy test and questioning me. Oh, it's a test. Are you trying to get pregnant to get a ring on your finger? That's what it is. Facing David's question, I was completely at a loss. Are you kidding me? At that moment, David said he didn't want kids at all, but he never even thought about whether the test was mine. Meanwhile, his sister came home. When she saw the pregnancy test on the table, she instantly got nervous. I had a feeling, you know, and then after 5 days, I'm sure it's right. When he found out the one who was pregnant was Lily, he finally realized his mistake. But when he tried to come explain to me, Lily stopped him. It's right. I don't know how to tell him. Just show him the test. I'm sure he's gonna be happy. You're you're sure it's gonna be okay? Yeah, you guys gonna be fine. Trust me, I gotta go upstairs. When David came to my place, he desperately wanted my forgiveness, but his attitude that morning had already broken my heart. No matter how much he explained, I felt nothing inside to try to fix our relationship. David even took out our token of love. But what he didn't expect was that I threw it away right in front of him. Why would you do this? Why It's called break it to save it. Sometimes you have to break things to keep them. And plus, coffee is a bad habit, Chris, just like you. Bye. But, but rejected and heartbroken, David went home. Before he could even think about what he'd done, he ran into an even bigger problem. I showed it this to Dave and he, he told me to deal with it or back my things and get out. When he found out Lily's boyfriend acted exactly like he did to protect his sister's feelings, David had no choice but to confront Dave. Chris, listen. Shut your mouth and sit your ass down. We gotta talk. What kind of stupid ultimatum are you giving to my sister? Dave, you're a grown ass, man. You gotta take responsibility for your actions. I completely agree with you. I love Lena. She's the best thing that ever happened to me. Okay. So what's the problem, man? It's just I'm not ready to be a father. What would you do in my place? What would you do? Dave's words left David speechless because his way of dealing with it was even harsher than Tony's. But after David's patient persuasion, Dave decided to do something meaningful. Can I borrow some money from you? What? Why? A ring for your sister. Seen Dave's sincerity, David didn't hesitate to help him. When it came to other people's problems, David could think clearly, but his own life was a complete mess. Later, he. Came to my place again, but I was still cold to him. When David showed me the cup he had carefully glued back together and sincerely apologized. Means so much to me and you're so important for me. And I'm not ready to lose you. I cannot lose you, right? So I wanna fight for us and I, I can fix that, okay? I poured water into the cup to show him exactly what our relationship had become. See, some things can't be fixed.

When she heard her son crying, she quickly adjusted her angle and forced the window up little by little. Seeing Anna rolling up the window, the dog tried to get in through the other door while she wasn't looking. To its surprise, Anna had already locked that door, too. She hurried to comfort her son, saying, it's okay now. The boy immediately told Anna, that dog ran out of my closet. But Anna didn't believe him at all. Instead, she reassured him, it's just. Just a dog. Nothing to fear. What she didn't know was that the dog had mutated. It kept slamming into the car window, trying to scratch through it. Anna huddled in the corner, terrified. The sound of the window being hit made the boy cry even harder. Luckily, the window was strong enough to hold. Just when Anna thought the dog was gone and got ready to start the car to go home, the engine wouldn't turn over. Looking at her upset son, Anna pulled him into her arms. She had no idea the dog hadn't left. It was lying on the stone steps not far Away, waiting for a chance to launch a fatal attack, the boy lay down in the back seat while Anna tried to figure out how to get out of that godforsaken place. Noticing her worry, the boy asked, mom, why aren't we leaving? So Anna decided to try starting the car again. Fortunately, the engine finally roared to life. This time, the boy quickly climbed into the front passenger seat. During the car start, the big dog rushed toward them. At that moment, Anna suddenly stopped the car. She was just muttering a complaint about the dog when the car stalled halfway through reversing. Its power system had died. Worse still, no matter how hard Anna tried, she couldn't restart the car. When she saw the dog was still outside, she completely broke down. The dog never left. By nightfall, it was even lying right in front of the car. Just then, the boy said he needed to use the bathroom urgently. The big dog was instantly drawn.

El cepillo que usaba llevaba un escáner oculto y mientras limpiaba, escaneó en secreto el número de chasis del vehículo. Los guardias, sin sospechar nada, le pagaron una buena propina para que se marchara. En cuanto se alejó, la mujer sacó su teléfono, conectó el cable de datos al escáner y envió el número de chasis a su cómplice. Cuando Paul recibió la información, hackeó rápidamente el sistema de control del vehículo y elevó la temperatura dentro del coche. Debido al calor, el capitán del convoy quiso encender el aire acondicionado, pero el sistema ya no respondía. Decidieron cambiar de vehículo, dejando que los compañeros aseguraran la zona. Primero, tras comprobar que todo estaba despejado, el capitán se preparó para salir con los diamantes, pero la puerta no se abría. De repente, el coche arrancó solo. Paul estaba controlándolo a distancia. El vehículo aceleró bruscamente y chocó contra el coche de atrás. El capitán cayó al suelo, se levantó enseguida y trató de tomar el control pisando el freno con fuerza, pero no sirvió de nada. El coche estaba completamente bajo el control de Paul. El vehículo embistió los coches que tenía cerca y siguió avanzando a toda velocidad. La policía federal envió dos coches para intentar bloquear el vehículo fuera de control, chocando repetidamente para detenerlo. Incluso se activaron los airbag, pero el coche no redujo la velocidad. Los tres coches siguieron Lado a lado, tratando de despistar al FBI. Al entrar en un túnel poco iluminado, Paul realizó un giro de 180 grados con un derrape perfect. Distanciándose de los perseguidores, el coche se detuvo frente a la entrada de un almacén. El capitán pensó que por fin había parado, pero en ese momento apareció un enorme camión empujando el coche hacia el interior. Las puertas del almacén se cerraron al instante. Paul encendió unas luces intensas para cegarlo. El capitán disparó hacia la fuente de luz, pero el parabrisas era antibalas y las balas rebotadas casi lo alcanzan. Después, Paul puso música a todo volumen, abrió el capó y reconectó el tubo de escape, inyectando dióxido de carbono dentro del coche. El gas salía por las rejillas de ventilación. El capitán intentó bloquearlas con las manos, pero fue inútil. El gas seguía entrando. Finalmente se rindió, concentrando todas sus fuerzas en proteger la caja. Poco después perdió el conocimiento. Horas más tarde, el FBI lo encontró inconsciente. Abrieron la caja para comprobar el contenido, pero dentro solo estaba el dinero que habían usado para pagarle a la falsa limpiadora. Los diamantes, valorados en cientos de millones, ya estaban en manos de Paul

","phillies,sportsnews,mlbtradedeadline,baseballupdates","The girl quietly slipped out of her house. Not far away, a motorcycle pulled up beside her. The bodyguard trailed behind, and the girl could only pretend to draw his gun, hoping to scare the rider off. But the man didn't flinch. He even snapped a photo of the girl before speeding away on his bike. As he passed the bodyguard, the bodyguard caught sight of a tattoo on his hand. That reaction was not something an ordinary person would show. The man's name was Jack. He had once served in the Special Forces. After retiring, he took a job as a bodyguard at the mansion. His main duty was to protect Amy. Because Amy was mischievous, he often tried to sneak out. Though nothing serious happened this time, the employer was furious, blaming Jack harshly. But the employer's wife defended him. After all, Amy was only 9 years old and it was natural for her to want to play outside. Later, the employer relented and allowed them to go out for a stroll. Jack drove, acting as both chauffeur and guard, taking the mother and daughter to the mall. Then Jack spotted that same motorcycle again and his instincts went on high alert. He rushed back to the car, ordered the mother and daughter to fasten their seatbelts and sped away from the mall. The two were pale with fear. They clearly recognized the men chasing them. Jack managed to shake off the pursuers once they were safely home. He sat Amy down and asked what had really happened. This time, Amy stopped hiding the truth. She finally told Jack the long buried secret of her family.

It's not working. We need the antivenom. What are you doing to my baby? Doctor Roman, can you please tell Mrs. Harrison what's going on here? Step back, please. Kelly's in really good hands. They're intubating her to help her breathe. Dr. Cooper is inserting a small tube into her trachea. She's not in any pain. Come on, baby. Stay with us, Kelly. Stay with us, honey. Hey, do you hear that? That's the sound of your baby breathing. She has an infection. What we call RSV. Kids get it in playgrounds and at schools and ER waiting rooms. I'm sorry, I don't understand. The ER is full of germs. It is no place for a healthy infant. This is my fault. Oh, listen, we've all been there. You want to be a good mom? I put my number in there. And the next time you're worried about Kelly's health, won't you text me? I'll let you know if it's an emergency. The love jungle? Yeah, some escapist crap. Do yourself a favor. Get out of your head. How'd it go? I may take up breathing again next year. Stay had relapse written all over it. You did great. Thank you for being here today with me, doing whatever this is. You wanna grab a bite, celebrate? Uh, I would love to, but a bunch of people are coming to my house tonight to play poker. Should I introduce you as my sponsor? Jesus! God, no. And they'll all just look at me funny. Why don't you lie and say I'm your friend? I don't know. I can do that.

Can you meet me before I do something crazy? Call me. I'm very happy for your dad and that was not your news to share. Cell phone, wallet. I got her. She does not have access to anything and she does not go anywhere without an adult present, school or home. I have to get back to work. You get a family discount on bail. I got you covered. Well, you know, who knows? Maybe this will be good for Grace. Maybe it'll give her someone new to hate or maybe we can hate her together. Jackie, this is a vulnerable time. Being sober can get really boring. Other people move on and they make healthy choices. You're gonna be prone to some very bad impulsive behavior. Just promise me you won't make any big decisions today. Can I tell you how badly I wanna use right now? Get fat, not high. Do you want me to take the dog out? Yes, yes. Do you want me to take the dog out? Yes. That was some. Yes. Who are you dreaming about? Oh, Brad Pitt. Sorry. You're dating other men in your head. I think I should move in here and stake my claim. You know, I'm here all the time. Anyway, it's kind of logical. I'm meeting Kevin's fiance tonight. One logical thing at a time. Okay, got it. You need to be convinced. I'll begin by taking the dog out for a shit. I'm so glad you're Here I would feel like such a lunatic otherwise. Oh, you're not a lunatic. We're just two nice ladies drinking really expensive coffee and spying on Kevin's fiance. Oh, nothing crazy here. Listen, you wanna stay clean. You gotta know what you're dealing with before you're dealing with it. Oh, my God. Is that her? Jesus Christ, she's pretty. Hi. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi. I'm sorry. I'm sure you're a very nice person, but, uh, we are supposed to be punishing Grace for shoplifting, not buying her affection. You're fucking crazy, Jackie. Did you just call me Jackie? You can't call me Jackie.

I'm not a baby expert, but I'm pretty sure they're not supposed to shrink. Well, there's this diet we put her on when she stopped breastfeeding. But it's healthy. Um, raw food. We're vegans. Almond milk, tofu, uh, vegetables. Raw food only. Our ancestors had mastered the secret of fire. Babies need fat, proteins, calories. Less important, sprouts and hemp. Starving babies is bad and illegal in many cultures. I'm having her admitted. Is she gonna be alright? Antibiotics for the pneumonia, IV feeding to get the weight up. Don't worry, it's a vegan IV. She's doing better. Oh, thank god. Technically, Alexander Fleming, he developed antibiotics. Pneumonia is under control. From now on, let's see you go with human food, okay? Absolutely. Swear to god this time. That's your guy. Rachel and Joel Kaplan? Yes. You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. What do we do? You're being charged with child endangerment. What? How? We're starving your kid. I'm from social services. We're taking responsibility for your baby. You guys bust out? We made bail. They won't let us in our baby's room. Weird. I think they'd let you take her home while they figured out if you tried to kill her. We're good parents. We fed her whenever she was hungry. Big meals. We had no idea that diet was so bad for her. The nutritionist said it had everything. She Needed. The kid who stacks the free range grapefruit in your health food store is not a nutritionist. But my uncle is. Went to college and everything.
