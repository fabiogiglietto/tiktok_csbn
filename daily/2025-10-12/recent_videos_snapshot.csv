I still took her to the rooftop, got down on one knee, then pulled out her texts with her gym buddy and said loudly, actually, I'm not proposing. I'm here to say goodbye in front of everyone you tried to impress. This happened 3 weeks ago and I'm still processing it. My girlfriend Danielle and I had been together for 3 years. I've been dropping engagement hints constantly, showing me rings, talking about weddings. I've been secretly saving for months, even picked out a ring. The plan was to propose at her company's rooftop holiday party. She kept mentioning how romantic it would be with the City Lights and all her co workers there. But last Tuesday changed everything. I came home early from my hospital shift. I heard Danielle on Facetime upstairs laughing. Melissa, he's definitely doing it at the party tomorrow. He's been acting all secretive. I stopped on the stairs. That's exciting. Are you ready? Her sister asked. Here's the thing, I'm saying no right in front of everyone. My blood went cold. Danielle, what? Why? He needs a reality check. Plus, you know Anthony from Crossfit. He just started his own business. Way more ambitious than a nurse. Anthony, the guy she'd been training with three nights a week. You're really going to humiliate him at your work party? Picture this, all my co workers watching. He gets Down on one knee and I just say sorry. But no, maybe he'll understand. He can't coast through life helping sick people all day. They both giggled. I quietly went to my car and sat there for an hour. That night, Danielle was all over me. Babe, I love you so much. All I could think about was her planning my destruction. Wednesday morning, her phone buzzed with a text from Anthony. Can't wait to celebrate tomorrow. She'd left it unlocked. I scrolled through their messages. So, so tomorrow's the big day, Anthony had written. Yep, poor guy has no idea what's coming. You sure you wanna do this at work? Seems harsh. He needs this wake up call. Besides, I'll need someone to comfort me after. Always here for you. Can't wait to see his face. Weeks of messages like this. I took screenshots. That afternoon, Danielle called me bouncing with excitement. Tom, I can't wait for tonight. Everyone's going to be there. My boss, the whole team. It's going to be perfect. Perfect for my public destruction. Can't wait, I said. The party was on the 40th floor with incredible downtown views. Danielle Network introduced me as my boyfriend, Tom. He's a nurse. Like she was embarrassed. Anthony showed up around eight PM, big guy, Crossfit shirt, giving me this smug look. Around 9:30, Danielle got antsy, checking her phone constantly. The view is incredible. So romantic with these lights. It really is beautiful. Perfect setting for something. Special to happen. You're absolutely right. Could you get everyone's attention? I have something to say. Her eyes lit up. She called out everyone. Tom has something to share. The room quieted. Her boss smiled. Anthony pulled out his phone. Probably to record my humiliation. I got down.

I woke up to my teenage daughter Kayla's piercing screams. I ran into her bedroom and couldn't believe what I saw. She was completely bald, her blonde hair scattered across her pillowcase. She was sobbing, telling me her little sister Reese must have shaved her head while she was sleeping. She stumbled to the bathroom mirror and started screaming even loud when she saw her reflection. Prom was in 8 hours and she was supposed to be a shoe in for Queen. Now it was ruined. Where's Reese, I demanded. And my husband found her sitting on her own bed in her unicorn pajamas with his electric razor on her nightstand. Reese, what did you do? I asked, trying not to scream while Kayla sobbed in the bathroom. I had to stop her from going to prom, Reese said in that small voice she uses when she knows she's in trouble but thinks she did the right thing. This was my baby, who still crawled into Kayla's bed during thunderstorms. The same little girl who Kayla taught to ride a bike last summer, the one who followed her big sister everywhere, asking endless questions about everything. I couldn't believe she would sabotage her sister's big night like this. Before I could respond, the doorbell rang. Kayla's boyfriend, Steven, let himself in like he always did on Saturday mornings. He came Upstairs calling about corsage colours and stopped dead when he saw Kayla's bald head. What the hell happened to your hair, he asked and quickly rearranged his face into concern. Baby, don't cry. We can fix this. Maybe get you a nice wig. You'll still be the prettiest girl there. Kayla was crying harder now. Steven pulled her against him while glaring at me like this was my fault. Did Reese do this? I always said that kid was weird. This is assault, Missus Adams. Reese appeared in the bathroom doorway still in her unicorn pajamas. I cut off all her hair so she couldn't go to prom with you because you're mean to her, Reese, I yelled. But she kept talking in that determined little kid voice. You hurt my sister all the time, Kevin. I see the purple marks on her arms where you grabbed her too hard. The bathroom went silent. Steven laughed, but it sounded forced. Kids make up crazy stories. Missus Adams, tell her, Kayla, tell your mom how good I am to you. Kayla wouldn't look at anyone. I felt ice spreading through my chest. I took pictures on Mommy's phone. When Kayla was sleeping, Reese said, her voice getting stronger. You push her into walls. You hit her tummy where nobody can see. Then you buy her presents after so she won't tell. I pulled out my phone with shaking hands and opened my photos. There they were, close UPS of Kayla's arms. With finger shaped bruises, her ribs with dark purple marks. I felt my stomach drop. Oh, my god, I whispered. Kayla, is this true? Steven's face was getting red. Those could be from anything she plays.

The call came through my commanding officer. Your son committed felony assault at his father's wedding. You need to get home now. I was on a base in Germany and hadn't seen my boys in 8 months. Now my teenage son who stopped wrestling because he hated hurting people was facing charges for brutalizing a woman at the altar. After an 18 hour emergency flight, I, I headed to my ex husband's house where my son was. The wife's dark blood was still stained by the driveway. I rang the doorbell. My ex husband Conrad answered. His face twisted with rage. We're pressing charges. I'm not taking anyone's side until I see both, I said. Pushing past him. The living room was a tribunal. Conrad's parents on the couch, his brother Potter by the fireplace, his sister Fenn in the corner, the bride's parents standing like guard dogs. And in the center the bride Lauren with a splinted nose, two black eyes, bandages across her face. She he was crying, dabbing her eyes carefully around the swelling. And there surrounded by this mob sat my son, my 14 year old who refused to kill insects because he could have been born an ant, who taught his little stepbrother origami. He sat perfectly straight, chin raised, looking me dead in the eyes with zero regret. He looked proud of what he Did your son destroyed our family, Conrad spat. Look what he did to her face. Lauren sobbed harder. He's an animal. They're trying him as an adult, right? Grandpa shook his head in disgust. I looked at my son. His knuckles were still bruised and swollen. There seemed to be no real excuse. But then I asked for his side of the story. He looked around the room slowly taking in every face. Then he spoke. Voice clear. You wanna know the truth? She's been molesting me for 6 months. That's why I did it. My world stopped, but the room exploded instantly. Liar. Disgusting. How dare you. Lauren's face shifted for just a sec and before she wailed louder. He's making it up. I've been nothing but loving. Her mother stepped forward pointing at my son. You evil little. But her father grabbed her arm, his face pale like he'd been expecting this. In the midst of all the chaos, my son pulled out his phone and swiped to his hidden photos, she said. Fourteen year old boys always want it said. I should be grateful. I saw the images over his shoulder and my stomach turned. Conrad's hands were shaking as he stared at the screen. Those could be anyone could have, but his voice was hollow like he was reading a script. He didn't believe Lauren tried to snatch the phone. Those are out of context. I, it was just she stopped realizing. She just admitted they Were real. My son stood up, voice shaking with rage. Dad, I told you three months ago, you said she's just being affectionate. Conrad started stuttering. I didn't. I thought, Grandpa, you laughed. Lucky boy. Wish I had that problem at 14. Grandpa's face went from red to white. He looked at Lauren, then at his grandson, and something crumbled in his expression. Aunt Fenn, you told me, don't be dramatic. Fenn was backing toward the door, tears streaming. Oh, god. Oh, god. I thought you were just Uncle Potter. You said I should be grateful Potter had his head in his hands. Jesus Christ. I was joking. I didn't know she was actually grandma. You said boys can't be great by women. Grandma collapsed into the couch, rosary beads in her hands, whispering prayers. Every single one of you told me to shut up about it. Lauren's parents were having a whispered argument. Her father hissed. Not again, Patricia. You said she was better. The word again hung in the air. But that's not why I hit her. My son cut through. Everyone immediately froze. What do you.

My boyfriend Eric had this problem. He couldn't put his phone down ever. Like the guy would literally text while I was talking to him at dinner. I'd catch him scrolling Instagram in the bathroom, dming random girls on Snapchat, always saying he was just networking for his music career. We've been together almost 4 years. We lived together, shared custody of our golden retriever, Benny, even had matching coffee mugs. I thought we were solid. Sure, Eric spent way too much time on his phone, but I figured all guys our age were like that. Then one Tuesday night, he came home from work acting weird, wouldn't look at me, kept checking his phone every 5 seconds, had this stupid grin on his face. I asked what was up and he said we needed to talk. I met someone, he said, still staring at his phone. Her name is Stacy. She just gets me, you know, like we talk for hours every night about deep stuff, things you never ask me about. I was confused. What do you mean you met someone where Snapchat, but it's not like that. We have this connection. She understands my music, my dreams. She actually listens to me. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. He was dumping me for some girl he'd never met? Some random person online? Eric, that's insane. You don't even know this person. But he was already packing his stuff. Said Stacy was helping him become a better version of himself, that she believed in his potential. That I was just holding him back from his true happiness. Whole thing was so bizarre. I didn't even fight it. I just watched him stuff his clothes into trash bags like our 4 years together meant nothing. But here's the thing about Eric. He was careless with his phone. I remembered seeing this girl Snapchat handle a few weeks earlier when he left it unlocked on the counter. So after he moved out, I got curious. I made a fake account and searched for her.

My cousin Rachel just buried her husband and two kids last week. Car accident took them all at once. She's left with just her five year old daughter, Emma. And honestly, watching them at the funeral was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So my brother Jake and his wife Kelly show up to our house that morning. Before we head to the church, first thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral, and she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her, but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. The cemetery. She literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would mention How hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I know. Now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce, pregnant lady coming through or, baby on board needs to pee. There were, like, 30 people there grieving, and she's treating it like her personal pregnancy announcement party. But then she crossed the line. Rachel was sitting

Did we hide in my ex's tattoo when everyone realised how horrible he was? I was cleaning my station at the tattoo shop ready to go home when out of nowhere I heard that voice, that nauseating, too familiar laugh that used to make my heart race for all the wrong reasons. Nate, my ex, who told me I was too clingy when I caught him texting three other girls. My anxiety was exhausting. When I asked why he kept hiding his phone, I tried my best to hide myself and thankfully he just walked by. But I heard everything. Babe, matching tattoos are so cringe. How will I even know I'll still like you? The girl's voice was small but hopeful. I just thought it would be romantic, he laughed. You're lucky I even came to look with you. It's always you with your dumb woman ideas. My coworker Jacqueline's eyes met mine. She knew my history. She'd held me through the breakdown six months ago when I found out Nate had been cheating our entire two year relationship. That's when Jaclyn walked over all professional smiles and I saw that look in her eyes. She was up to something. Jaclyn started showing them designs, but after a few minutes, I watched her go back to grab her phone. 30 seconds later, I got a notification from our group chat. Remember that one idea we had? It's go time. Within minutes, our entire crew was involved. Everybody Started getting excited, but I didn't know what this idea they were talking about was. Jaclyn pulled out her tablet, showing them some thing that made the girlfriend immediately gasped. Oh, my god, it's perfect. Nate barely glanced up from his phone. Yeah, whatever makes you happy, babe. Jacqueline's face was completely professional. I saw her jaw clench, fighting something. She excused herself for a moment and practically sprinted to the back room where I was hiding. The second the door closed, she collapsed against the wall, tears streaming down her face, trying not to laugh. I can't go back out there. You have to see this design. But before she could show me, Jade burst in, mascara running. I just told them it's eternal love, sacred geometry, he said. Whatever. I'm going to pee myself. We had to take turns going back out, each of us needing breaks to compose ourselves. The girlfriend was glowing, texting her entire family pictures of the design. We were all praying none of them would notice. And by some miracle, they didn't. They decided she'd go first. Jacqueline took her to the chair while Nate waited up front. And that's when things got almost impossible. Jacqueline was doing the stencil, explaining something about special angle calculations for maximum symbolic connection. And the girlfriend was eating it up. Jacqueline's hand was shaking, not from nerves, from suppressed laughter. She had to excuse herself twice. When it was Nate's turn, our senior artist, Nick, took Over while I watched from the back with the other girls, all of us hold behind the half wall like kids watching something they shouldn't. Nate spent the entire session on Facetime with somebody talking about a girl from the gym. Yeah, bro. She's been all over my DMs. Might hit that this weekend. You feel me? His girlfriend was in the bathroom. We kept poking our heads around the corner and every time we'd see Nick's shoulders shaking. All of us still in disbelief of what his tattoo said. When both tattoos were done, they stood together, wrists touching and the girlfriend squealed. It's perfect.

I used to fake sick at least once a month. Nothing dramatic, just your classic ugh, my stomach hurts routine. I'd shuffle into the kitchen, wrap myself in a blanket, throw in a little cough, and wait for my mom to sigh and say, fine, but no video games. She always fell for it. Or maybe she just didn't care enough to argue. This time felt no different. It was a Thursday. I had a math test I wasn't ready for, and zero energy to sit through Mr. Danner's forty five minute rant about fractions, so I pulled out the old stomachache move. My mom was already halfway out the door for work, so she just nodded and left. I grabbed a bowl of cereal, flopped on to the couch, and turned on some cartoons, already feeling like I'd won. Dad works nights, so he usually sleeps through most of the day and the house stays quiet, but around 10:00 I heard his door open. I muted the TV and listened. He walked past the living room without noticing me, phone in hand, and stepped out into the garage. Didn't think much of it at first, figured maybe he was calling in sick or trying to get a refund for something. But then I heard his voice through the wall. And it wasn't his normal voice. It was quiet, tired, flat. I can't do this anymore, he said. I paused. I Tried. I really tried. But I feel like I don't even know my family anymore. I come home and everything's just cold. I tiptoed down the hall, heart suddenly racing. The garage door was cracked open, just like always, and I crouched beside it. I know this isn't what we wanted, but it's where we are now, he said. Every day I feel like I'm just pretending. Pretending to be fine. Pretending to be a good husband, a good dad. My stomach twisted. This time for real. I mean, look at him, he said. He doesn't even like me. He doesn't talk to me unless he wants something. And when he does, it's just one word. Answers. I don't even know who he is anymore. My throat went dry. I look at him and all I can think is, what happened? What did I do wrong? When did he start looking at me like I was a stranger? There was silence then. I know it's awful, but sometimes I wonder if I'd be happier alone. Just starting over. Somewhere quiet. Somewhere nobody knows me. My chest felt like it caved in. I haven't said anything to her yet, he continued. I don't even know if I will. But I can't keep going like this. I'm exhausted. I backed away from the door before I could hear more. I stumbled into the bathroom and locked the door behind me, sat on the edge of the tub and stared at the floor. He didn't know I was home. He didn't know I was listening. And he definitely didn't know I had just realized something I could never unhear. My dad didn't just feel lost. He felt lost because of me. I stayed in the bathroom for over an hour, just trying to breathe. When I finally came out, he was back in his room. I crept into mine, got under the covers, and didn't move for the rest the day. Later that night, he knocked on my door. How's your stomach? He asked. Fine. I mumbled. Need anything? No. He stood there for a second longer, then said, okay, let me know. I said nothing.

I had to choose. I'm at work on a Tuesday morning when my wife texts having contractions. Think this is it. Meet you at Memorial Hospital. I'm grabbing my car keys when my phone rings. It's my twin sister and she's sobbing. My water just broke. I'm scared. I'm headed to Valencia Hospital. Please come. I freeze in the parking lot holding the phone up to my ear. My wife is 39 weeks pregnant with our first baby. My sister is only 34 weeks, making this a high risk pregnancy. And her boyfriend left her two months ago after they found out the baby has down syndrome. The hospitals are 45 minutes apart in opposite directions. I stand there like an idiot while the two most important women in my life need me in two different places. I drive toward my sister first because she's alone and high risk. I call my wife from the car. When I tell her, she's crying but says she understands. My sister texts, contractions getting stronger. Nurse says I'm 4 cm dilated. I think back to when my sister held my hand through our dad's death when we were 16. She's been there through my depression, my divorce from my first marriage, everything. She chose me as her birth partner months ago when her boyfriend bailed. My wife texts, contractions five minutes apart now. Then I'm scared, too. Then we promised We'd do this together. My wife has an anxiety disorder and she's been planning this birth for three years. The playlist wrote letters to the baby. We practice breathing exercises every night. I'm driving when my breathing starts coming in faster and my hands are shaking so bad, I swerve into the other lane. A truck horn blares and I yank the wheel back, nearly going off the road. I have to pull over on the highway shoulder just so I can gasp for air. Full panic attack, head and hands on the steering wheel trying to breathe. My phone explodes with calls. I answer them one by one. My mother in law is screaming, we just got to the hospital. Where are you? How dare you leave her right now? My father in law texts, get back here now. Man up and support your family. Then my mom calls, we're getting on a plane but that's five hours away. You need to step up as her big brother. Your sister has nobody. The baby might not survive. My dad texts, blood comes first. Your wife has family, your sister has no one. I sit there for a moment longer breathing. Then I call both hospitals. My sister's nurse says she's asking for you. She's terrified. My wife's nurse told me she's progressing fast. Where are you? My phone's at 5% battery from all the calls at this point. The last thing I hear is my mother in law saying If you're not here when that baby comes, don't bother coming home. My phone dies right there in my hands, still vibrating with another call coming in. I choose to go to my sister because she's alone and at higher risk. I speed toward her hospital, crying the whole way. I run into the emergency room, asking for her delivery room. The nurse looks confused.

I told a teenage girl she was gonna get assaulted working the night shift at a truck stop and she kicked me out for harassment. I've been driving trucks for 12 years now and I've seen people, men especially, at their darkest late at night on the road. I started driving trucks after my daughter was born because it paid better than warehouse work. My route takes me from Dallas up through Arkansas and into Tennessee. There's this one gas station that I try to avoid like a plague. It's one of those places where the parking lot lights are half broken and there's always sketchy stuff going down. Some nightmare on Elm Street shite last time I was there some tweaker tried to sell me a chainsaw at 3 in the morning. But sometimes you need gas and it's the only stop for 40 miles. This it happened about six months ago. I pulled in around 11 at night and noticed something was different right away. The old guy who usually work nights wasn't behind the counter. Instead there was this young girl who couldn't have been older than 19. She had bright purple hair and enough piercings to make her head explode in an MRI, full sleeve tattoos on both arms too. She was reading a textbook when I walked in so I figured she was a student. I grabbed an energy drink and beef jerky and Went up to pay. You new here, I asked while she rang me up. Yeah, started last week, she said, without looking up from scanning. They had a help wanted sign in the hours work with my class schedule. My stomach dropped a little. This girl had no idea what she'd signed up for. So I told her very respectfully, listen, I don't mean to pry, but you might want to find somewhere else to work. This place gets rough espe actually at night. She finally looked up at me and her face went hard. I can take care of myself, thanks. That annoyed me a little, but I needed her to understand. I'm sure you can, but the drivers that come through here aren't your average cost. Some of these guys have been on the road for days straight. They get weird ideas in their heads, especially when they see a young woman working alone. Is that supposed to be a threat? Her voice got sharp. No, I'm trying to warn you. I've been stopping here for years and I've seen some bad stuff go down. You need to at least keep some heat under the counter for Protection. Get out. She pointed at the door. I don't need some random trucker man explaining danger to me. I that I can handle myself. I don't even know what man'splaining is. I said, look, I have a daughter about your age and I'd want someone to tell her before I Could even say anything else. She screamed out, before I call the cops and report you for harassment, I held up my hands and backed away. Fine, I tried. Some people just won't listen when you're trying to help them. I paid for my stuff and left without another word. Back in my truck, I popped open the energy drink and did my usual safety check. Tires looked good. Load was cure. I was just about to pull out when I remembered I'd promised my wife I'd grab diapers on the way home. My wife just had another baby girl. She goes through them like crazy and we were almost out. I sat there for a minute debating whether to go back in. The girl clearly didn't want me there, but I really needed those diapers. I waited about five minutes to let things cool down, then headed back inside. The store was empty. That purple haired girl behind the counter, I hoped for the best and told myself maybe she was in the bathroom or on break. Then I heard.

The bride stopped mid pose, her photographer looked confused, and about 30 wedding guests turned to stare at my three year old daughter, Emma, standing by the playground swings. I was mortified. Emma had this habit of saying random things loudly at the worst possible moments, but this was next level embarrassing. Emma, honey, let's go play on the slides, I whispered, trying to drag her away from the wedding party, but she wasn't having it. She broke free from my grip and marched right up to the bride, tugging on her dress. Lady, don't marry the mean man, Emma said, pointing directly at the groom. He's gonna hurt you. Everyone went dead silent. The groom's face went red and he started walking toward us looking angry. Hey, what kind of kids says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just three and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve. My mommy had marks like that. When the bad man lived with us, she cried at night, too. Just like you smell like tears under your makeup. My heart stopped. This kid had been through way too much for her age, but she developed This weird ability to spot things adults tried to hide. When my ex was still around, Emma would always know when I'd been crying, even if I thought I'd covered it up perfectly.

Daddy locked me out, he said. I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was and carried her toward our front door. It was locked.

She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's Pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turn to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me, nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter. Nora was still clinging to me. Her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up Ching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever, but I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years, the man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me. He Picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear, from rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialed a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine. It's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we.

She still thinks she's learning how to flirt. Trish started working at my waitressing job five months ago, and from the moment she saw my boyfriend Kyo, she set her eyes on him like he was the last Infinity Stone. He was half Japanese like me, meaning we related on a deep level, and for some reason Trish hated this the most. The first time she saw us having lunch, she made herself comfortable in my seat next to his. When I got up to use the bathroom, she pressed her hips against his and flashed a flirty smile before saying konnichiwa. When he awkwardly set it back, she grabbed a pair of chopsticks and started eating noodles, unsuccessfully complaining about whitewashed girls appropriating his beautiful culture, very obviously referring to me. When I came back from the bathroom, she told me to grab a chair, telling me I was welcome to join in on their conversation. It definitely struck a nerve, but I was so secure in Kaido and I's relationship, I didn't even mind until Trish started trying to implode us. She'd corner him when I wasn't looking and tell him innuendo style phrases in Japanese that she got off Google Translate. Whenever we were talking, she'd always squeeze past us very slowly, sometimes making sure to rub her behind against Kaido, and other times facing him directly and giving him the Effy eyes. The thing that really made me mad was when she asked Kaido to come teach her Japanese at her house after work. I was going to confront her there and then, but we were in the middle of a very busy service. And I told myself I'd do it right after. Big mistake. You see, at some point during service, these important Japanese business men came in for food. They were at my section. But Trish practically shoved me aside to serve them. Please speak Japanese. I understand everything she told them. They looked pleasantly surprised and started rattling off their order with specific modifications and allergies. Trish just kept saying hi, hi! While scribbling nonsense. Forty five minutes later, it was chaos. One guy got served the wrong starter. Another received two sushi orders instead of his chicken chow Mein. And the third guy actually started having an allergic reaction to shellfish, which he asked to exclude. That's when Trish did it. While Kaido ran to get the Epipen, she pointed at me and told her cousin, who is the manager, that I changed the order to sabotage her. And without verifying anything, her cousin wrote me up on the spot in front of everyone. One more incident and you're terminated. I went home crushed and just cried to Kaido. I was wondering

You have no rights. She forgot the house was built on land with a 99 year lease that expires next month. Jennifer ended our marriage Thursday night with ice cold precision. I'm done, David. I want a divorce. I've already talked to my lawyer. Then she delivered what she thought was the killing blow. I'll be keeping the house and everything in it. You need to pack your stuff and be gone by Sunday. The house? Jen, we've lived here for eight years, built our whole life here. Don't be stupid, she sneered. The house is in my name. The deed, the mortgage, all of it. You have zero legal rights to this property. As she stood there looking so smug and victorious, I felt this strange calm wash over me. She was absolutely right. The house was 100% in her name. But Jennifer had always been careless about paperwork. She'd forgotten one tiny detail buried in the property documents. Three years ago, I was working as a city planning assistant. Part of my job was reviewing old property records and lease agreements. That's when I discovered something interesting about our neighborhood. Most people don't know this, but some residential areas in our city were built on land that the original developers leased, not bought outright. Our house sits on one of those plots. A 99 year ground lease that started in 1925. When we bought the house. Eight years ago, I noticed it in the fine print. The lease expires February 15th, 2025. That's exactly three weeks from today. I tried to explain it to Jennifer back then, but she was too excited about getting the house to listen. Whatever, David. Just handle the boring legal stuff. I don't care about ancient lease agreements. So I handled it. I contacted the original landowner's estate and negotiated renewal terms. They agreed to sell me the land outright for $180,000, but only if I exercised the option before the lease expired. I've been saving for three years, putting aside money for my promotion without telling Jennifer. She thought I was just being cheap when I suggested we skip expensive vacations. You're right, I told her, my voice completely hollow. It's your house. I'll be packed and gone by Saturday. The relief and triumph on her face was something I'll never forget. She actually looked happy that she was destroying our marriage. I spent Friday packing, acting completely defeated. She watched me with this peeing look, probably thinking about how she'd finally gotten rid of dead weight. Me. She had no clue what was about to hit her. Saturday morning, I called Morrison and Associates, the law firm handling the estate. This is David Walsh. I'd like to exercise my option to purchase the land at 47 Maple street before the lease expires. The lawyer was surprised. Mr. Walsh, that's cutting it close. The lease expires February 15th. If someone doesn't purchase by Then all structures on the property revert to the estate. I understand. I have you $180,000 ready to transfer today. Within two hours. I own the land underneath Jennifer's house. Monday, Jennifer got served papers from Morrison and Associates. The ground lease for her property had expired.

So I fucked his grandpa. Now, before you call me crazy, stay right there or I'll suck your balls one by one. A simple joke, a meme repeated 1,000 times by fucking kids on the internet. But when he threw it in my face, I felt a crack open inside me, as if behind that laughter there was icy contempt, a refusal to take me seriously. He thought I'd laugh with him, but hell, nah. So I chose to tear away from him what he thought was untouchable, his grandfather. The old man was guilty of nothing except existing in his lineage and having this little bastard with him. His wrinkled skin, his fragile breath, he embodied innocence. And that's precisely what made my act more cruel. I took it, I destroyed it, piece by piece, until only a suffocating silence remained. And then the unthinkable happened. Like a curse born of my actions, his body began to swell, to swell with an alien life. The grandfather, despite his age, now carried within him an impossible pregnancy, an abomination, a cursed child conceived in pain and despair. When his grandson discovered what was happening, his eyes filled with horror. I looked him straight in the eyes and whispered, did you wanna laugh? Look, now your grandfather carries within him the proof of my vengeance. And that laughter will haunt you until your death. That day, he understood that some jokes are worth more than a Smile. They breed monsters.

Everyone in class was losing their minds over this party. Kyle. Kyle made it sound like it was gonna be the event of the year. He handed me an invite, too.

My sister in law, Kelly, had her first miscarriage about six months ago. It was devastating. I get that. The whole family rallied around her and my brother Jake, bringing casseroles and giving them space to. But then she started acting like she was the only person who'd ever lost a baby. It started small. At family dinners, she'd make comments about how nobody understood what real loss felt like. When my cousin Amanda talked about her dog dying, Kelly rolled her eyes and said, that's not the same thing at all. When my mom mentioned missing my grandpa who died last year, Kelly literally scoffed and said, you got to say goodbye to him, though. The worst part was how she treated me. I've been married to my husband Chris for eight years, and we don't have kids yet. Kelly started making these passive aggressive comments about how lucky I was to not have to worry about these things, how I couldn't possibly understand what she was going through. Last weekend was my nephew's birthday party. Kelly seemed okay during most of it, playing with the kids and laughing at their jokes. But then my brother's friend brought up how his wife was pregnant, and Kelly's whole mood shifted. She got quiet and started picking out her food. Later, when we were in the kitchen cleaning up, Kelly started talking About how hard it was seeing pregnant women everywhere. I tried to be supportive, telling her I understood how triggering that must be. That's when she snapped. No, you don't understand, she said, her voice getting louder. You have no idea what it's like to lose a baby. You've never even been pregnant. You don't know what real loss feels like. Something inside me just broke. I've been holding this in for years, keeping it private, because Chris and I decided we didn't want the whole family knowing our business. But I was so tired of her acting like she had a monopoly on grief. Actually, Kelly, I said, my voice shaking, I've had four miscarriages. The kitchen went dead silent. My mom dropped the plate she was holding. Kelly's face went completely white. The first one was three years ago. I can continued. I was 12 weeks along. We thought we were safe to tell people, but then I started bleeding at work. Chris had to pick me up from the bathroom floor. Kelly tried to say something, but I kept going. The second one was a year later. Only eight weeks that time, but it didn't hurt any less. The third one was right before Christmas last year. I spent New Year's Eve in the hospital. The fourth one was two months ago.

So I'm dating Mitchell. He's 56, I'm 28. And yes, he's rich, like really rich. We met at the Starbucks where I was working on my laptop. He loved that I wasn't trying to get his attention and that I added to my coffee, in his words, more sugar than the Boston harbour needed in 1773. But here's what six months of dating him actually looks like. Waiters hand him the wine list. Never me. His friends, wives talk to me like I'm five, explaining what investment means really slowly. The valet gives Mitchell my car keys every single time. At his country club, someone always asks what I'm studying. I graduated four years ago. Last week, his lawyer asked if I needed help reading the dinner menu. It had seven items on it. Mitchell's company Christmas party is everything I expected and worse. I'm wearing this gorgeous Chanel dress that I bought myself because I liked it. And not even five minutes in, one of the wives pulls me into the bathroom. She puts her hand on my shoulder like she's about to deliver terrible news and tells me I need to save the money Mitchell gives me for when this ends. Did I mention having my own money? She laughs like I've told a joke and presses her friend's financial advisor card into my hand. He specializes in girls like me, apparently. Mitchell gets pulled into a work emergency Leaving me at the bar where his colleagues don't bother lowering their voices. How much do you think Mitchell spends on her monthly? One says. Worth every penny at that age? Another answers, cheaper than my boat maintenance. When I approach and mention my startup work, they find it hilarious. One actually asks if Mitchell taught me the word portfolio. Another suggests I'm confusing shopping with investing. And the boss himself walks over with his champagne and says the most insulting thing yet. When you and Mitchell are done, you should date my son. He's more age appropriate and needs a pretty girl. I say, I don't need anyone to take care of me, but he just pats my head like I'm a golden retriever. We all know what you need, sweetheart. I'm about to tell him exactly what I needed in that moment when I hear Mitchell's voice from the conference room. The door is cracked open and he's on speaker phone negotiating to buy a tech company. The seller is refusing his 10 million offer, insisting it's worth more, but won't explain why. Mitchell sounds increasingly desperate, repeatedly asking what he's missing. That's when my blood runs cold. I know this company. I know it intimately. I know exactly what Mitchell is missing. I push into the conference room. Before I can stop myself, Mitchell looks up, irritated at the interruption. He tells the seller on the phone, sorry, my girlfriend just wandered in. I'm already scanning the papers. Spread across the table, confirming what I suspected. The seller's voice crackles through the speaker, asking what's going on. I state simply that the company has three major clients not listed in the disclosure. Mitchell freezes. The seller's voice turns sharp, demanding to know how I could possibly know that. Mitchell starts apologizing for my intrusion while the CEO appears in the doorway. Mitchell, that's confidential information. You shouldn't be sharing these things. His wife laughs, suggesting, I overheard something. And I'm trying to sound smart, but I continue.

My school had this completely insane bathroom rule where you could only use the restroom twice per day. Two times. That was it. They gave each teacher a clipboard with our names on it and they had to check us off every single time we asked to go. The whole thing started because some kids were apparently vaping in the bathrooms. So instead of dealing with those specific kids, the administration decided to punish everyone. They hired Mrs. Wilson as the bathroom monitor and she took her job way too seriously. This woman would literally stand outside the bathrooms timing how long we were in there. By November, half the school was walking around looking like they were about to explode. My friend Connor actually wet himself during third period math because he, he already used his 2 bathroom passes for the day. The teacher just ignored him and kept teaching while this poor kid sat there humiliated. That's when Emma had enough. She was this quiet girl who never caused trouble, but she was also the smartest kid in our grade. During lunch, she pulled out the student handbook and started reading through all the bathroom policies. He found something interesting on page 47. The rules said students were limited to two bathroom visits per day, but it didn't say anything about how long each visit could be. Emma realized we could technically stay in there for hours. As long as we only went twice, Emma started spreading the word. She told us to bring books, snacks, whatever we needed. The plan was simple, make each bathroom visit count. So we did exactly that. The next Monday, I grabbed a sandwich and my history textbook before asking for my first bathroom pass. I stayed in there for 45 minutes, studying for my quiz next period.

We have been seeing each other for a year and everything looked and seemed like we are a couple. He said he loved me and I him. He spends every weekend with me and we have planned our first trip together, etc. Last weekend he was in bed and I made him pancakes because his birthday was on Tuesday. He was very happy about it and joked that I was spoiling him. I said that I wanted to spoil my man. I said I am not your man with the same energy. He didn't seem awkward or embarrassed, just as calm with a smile on his stupid face. I didn't take it seriously and said, yeah, I know you are not my man. He was more serious now and said, no, really, I am not your boyfriend. I felt sick, but I tried to be calm and I asked what we are. He said I don't know. Great FWB. I didn't say anything after that and he ate his pancakes in silence. Later he asked if we would do anything. I said that I was planning on cleaning and doing some paperwork. He left after an hour. I ran to the bathroom to be sick and I probably cried for a solid two hours. I couldn't keep anything in my stomach for the rest of the day. He texted that evening thanking me for the breakfast in Bed and that he thought I was amazing but I didn't answer. So he called a few times. I didn't answer. Around ten PM he rang my door. I just opened a jar and pretended I was sick with the flu and was going to bed. He offered to stay the night in case I needed help during the night and I said no. I didn't answer him on Sunday or Monday, and I didn't wish him a happy birthday on Tuesday either. And I have just been keeping it short text feigning sickness. He never brought up what he said once. Then yesterday he wrote that he missed me and that he hadn't gone this long without talking to me since we met and that he was going mad. He asked if we could at least have dinner. I said that I was very busy. He said don't you miss me? I said that I was very tired because I was out all night with a guy last night.

I've been keeping this notebook for six years and my girlfriend had no clue until last week. She always said I never opened up emotionally. But honestly, I just thought guys weren't supposed to talk about all the little things they notice. Growing up, my dad forgot everyone's birthday. My mom couldn't remember who liked what food. Their fights were brutal because nobody paid attention to anyone. I swore I'd never be that type of boyfriend. So in college, I started writing stuff down about whoever I was dating. Not weird stalker stuff, just normal things like how Ashley preferred hot chocolate when it rained but iced coffee when it was sunny. Or how Jessica's voice got higher when she was nervous about something. When I met Mia three years ago, the notebook got way more detailed. I wrote down everything, how she stirred her cereal exactly seven times before eating it, how she hummed the same tune when she was happy, how her left eyebrow twitched right before she'd start laughing at something. Every few weeks, I'd add new stuff, like how she only wore her lucky socks on job interview days or how she needed exactly eight minutes of silence when she got home from work before she could handle talking. I wrote down that she liked her apartment at exactly 72 degrees, not 71 or 73, that she always ordered extra pickles but never ate them, that she got cranky If she didn't eat something by 11:00am but never admitted she was hungry, the notebook helped me figure out when to give her space and when to push her to talk about stuff, when to play upbeat music and when she needed something sad. I knew she was stressed when she started reorganizing her bookshelf, so I'd order her favorite Thai food before she even realized she was hungry. When she was upset, she'd clean the bathroom obsessively so I'd run her a bath afterward. None of this felt calculated or weird to me. It just seemed like paying attention. But I never told her about it because it sounded super intense. When I thought about explaining it, like, hey, hey, babe, I've been documenting your behavior patterns for 3 years. Doesn't exactly sound romantic. Plus, guys don't really talk about this stuff with each other. I figured she'd think I was some kind of control freak or something. Last Tuesday, she was cleaning our home office while I was at work. She called me freaking out, asking why I had a notebook with her name on it hidden behind my desk. Panicked, thinking she'd found something embarrassing. But she said she hadn't opened it yet. She was waiting for me to get home to explain. The drive home felt like forever. I kept imagining her thinking I was documenting her flaws or planning to break up with her or something crazy. When I got there, she was sitting on The

My cousin Rachel just buried her husband and two kids last week. Car accident took them all at once. She's left with just her 5 year old daughter Emma. And honestly, watching them at the funeral was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So my brother Jake and his wife Kelly show up to our house that morning before we head to the church. First thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral. And she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. The cemetery, she literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would mention How hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I know. Now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce pregnant lady coming through or baby on board needs to pee. There were like 30 people there grieving. And she's treating it like her personal pregnancy announcement party. But then she crossed the line. Rachel was sitting.

The bride stopped mid pose. Her photographer looked confused and about 30 wedding guests turned to stare at my three year old daughter Emma standing by the playground swings. I was mortified. Emma had this habit of saying random things loudly at the worst possible moments, but this was next level embarrassing. Ma, honey, let's go play on the slides, I whispered, trying to drag her away from the wedding party, but she wasn't having it. She broke free from my grip and marched right up to the bride, tugging on her dress. Lady, don't marry the mean man, Emma said, pointing directly at the groom. He's gonna hurt you. Everyone went dead silent. The groom's face went red and he started walking toward us looking angry. Hey, what kind of kid says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just 3 and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve. My mommy had marks like that when the bad man lived with us. She cried at night, too, just like you smell like tears under your makeup. My heart stopped. This kid had been through way too much for her age, but she developed This weird ability to spot things adults tried to hide. When my ex was still around, Emma would always know when I'd been crying, even if I thought I'd covered it up perfectly.

So I cooked up something that made her want to die. My sister Meredith discovered the perfect scam when she was 12 years old. She Learned that faking allergies got her whatever she wanted. The first time it happened was at a birthday party. She didn't like the chocolate cake, so she told everyone she was allergic to cocoa. Boom, special vanilla cupcake just for her. By high school, she carried a list of 37 fake allergies, gluten, dairy, shellfish, nuts, red dye, MSG, you name it, she was dying from it. Parents change everything for Meredith's medical needs, special meals, special shopping trips, special everything. Meanwhile, I'd catch her sneaking pizza in her room at midnight, the same pizza that would kill her at dinner. When I got into culinary school, Meredith suddenly couldn't breathe around cooking oil. She'd walk by the kitchen and fall on the floor gasping. Mom made me practice cooking in the garage because Meredith's life was at risk. Opening my food truck should have been the best day of my life. Three years of saving every penny I had. Went into Nora's kitchen first day, lunch rush. There's Meredith. She ordered a salad, took one bite and threw herself on the ground. She was rolling around screaming that I poisoned her, clutching her throat, fake tears, full show. Someone called 9, 1 1. She told the paramedics I put gluten in her food on purpose. The hospital photos went everywhere. Online. My Yelp page got destroyed. People called me a murderer. I had to close for a week, lost thousands in sales. I finally saved enough to open a real restaurant. She did it again. Soft opening night. The place was packed with food critics and investors. Meredith touched a shrimp and went into fake shock. She was thashing on the floor. Her boyfriend, Caleb pretended to give her CPR. Everyone was filming. The health department shut me down the next day. My parents believed every lie. Dad said I should have been more careful. Mom banned me from Sunday dinners because my clothes might have bits of food on them. They spent thousands on fake EP pens while I was drowning in debt. Then came my biggest chance ever. Food Network called. They wanted me for their new show, Rising Star Chefs. Ten years of work LED to this moment. This was everything. Three hours before filming, Meredith called the producers, told them I sent her to the hospital at Thanksgiving by getting food on her plate. She sent fake medical records and to sue. They dropped me instantly. Too much risk, they said. That's when I snapped. Meredith was going to learn what real fear felt like. See, while Meredith faked being scared of food, she had one real fear, mice. Found one in her dollhouse at age 8 and never got over it. Just hearing a squeak made her panic. I started Recording her at her boyfriend's place got weeks of footage. Meredith eating pizza with extra cheese, shrimp with peanut sauce, everything that would supposedly kill her. She was having a feast while ruining my life. I bought 50 mice from a pet store, told them I had hungry snakes. Also bought jars of peanut butter, her deadliest allergy. I texted Meredith about making up over lunch, picked a restaurant across town that specialized in allergy free food. She loved the attention, posted photos about forgiving her sister while she was gone.

At my school, we created snitch lottery that spiraled into madness. My friend got accused of cheating by this girl who tattled on everyone. We were sick of it. I suggested putting fake confessions in the anonymous tip box. Nothing harmful, just ridiculous things like I'm replacing cafeteria salt with sugar or I'm hiding all the markers. Each Friday when the principal read concerns, we'd silently celebrate. Soon, our whole group was making confessions more outlandish. Each week, word spread and half the school will join. Kids bet on which confession would make assembly. Teams formed to create believable yet impossible scenarios. Things went nuclear when someone confessed to breeding raccoons in the ceiling. The principal called animal control who searched all day. While we tried not to lose it, teachers became paranoid looking for rule breakers who didn't exist. The counselor held meetings about the uptick and bizarre behaviour. The breaking point came when someone wrote about laxatives and faculty coffee. Though it never happened, five teachers called in sick. Next day they traced the handwriting and caught a senior. The principal was livid. They removed the tip box and threatened suspension for fabricating safety concerns. Snitch Lottery died that day, but for two months, we made our boring school believe it was losing its mind.

There's a boy across from her with an ice pack on his head and a teacher looking like she aged 10 years today. I go, Layla, what did you do? She goes, he tried to take my cookie. So I defended myself. Calm like She's in court. The principal sighs and says she hit him with a lunch tray. I blinked. I'm sorry. She what? Now the teacher jumps in. She told the boy, touch it and you lose a finger. We thought she was joking. Next thing we know, he grabs her cookie and boom, metal tray to the forehead. I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing because I know where she got that line, me. She got it from me. I said that last week about my fries at Chili's. But I clear my throat and say, Layla, you can't go around hitting people. He goes, he tried to rob me. What was I supposed to do care? Like it's a fairy tale. That cookie had my name on it in Sharpie. I wrote it. Possession is 9/10 of the law, y'all. She hit him with legal terms. The boy starts sniffling like he's the victim here. And Layla leans in and says, you should have asked. Now look at you. I stocked up like leftovers. I had to turn around and pretend to cough so I wouldn't laugh. I'm dying inside. The principal says, we don't condone violence. Layla goes, neither do I, but I condone consequences. I swear, this child is either gonna be a lawyer or in jail. So I take her home, try to give her a serious talk. I go, he can't be violent. Even if you're right, there's rules. She Goes exactly rule No. 1, don't touch my food. I said, Layla, I'm serious. She goes, okay, okay. Next time I'll use words. Maybe. Probably. And then y'all ready for the kicker? That night, I get a text from the mom of the boy. I'm bracing myself.

I live in a sketchy little neighborhood where everyone minds their business except for this one dude. Let's call him Rico. Rico is, well, he's like a local cryptid. No one knows where he lives but he appears at 3:00am yelling about government conspiracies, anime girls and how he once fought a raccoon with his bare hands. Classic Rico. Anyway, last night I'm walking back from the corner store with a bag of Hot Cheetos and chocolate milk living my best trashy life when out of nowhere Rico lunges at me like a feral possum in heat. He's screaming something about me stealing his aura. At this point my fight or flight kicked in and apparently my brain chose black magic. See, I've been dabbling in some alternative arts lately. Long story short, I had a transformation Hex saved on my notes app. Don't ask why, just accept it. So mid lunch I screamed the words, clap my hands together and suddenly poof, Rico is no longer Rico. Rico is now Rianna. Pink crop top, cat ears, thigh high socks, eyeliner sharper than my credit score, the full Femboy starter pack. He blinks, I blink. We both stand there for a solid five seconds like, did that just happen? Fast forward to today and uh, I may have listed him on Etsy under Handcrafted Chaos Beings. Someone from Portland bought him within 3 Minutes for 275 plus shipping. Now I'm sitting here sipping my chocolate milk, trying to process the fact that I may have invented a new side hustle. Before anyone asks, yes, Rico. Now Rianna is thriving. The buyer sent me pics. He's got a made outfit. Now I don't know how to feel.

I care about my teenage boy, but I'd be dishonest if I said I wasn't let down by the kind of person he's becoming. My son began getting into this different look back when he was in middle school. At first he just wore black clothes, but once he got to high school, he's gone way too far with his strange style and I really don't like it. My wife doesn't seem to mind, but she's a pretty passive woman and has never been a very strict parent like me. If I were to describe how my son dresses now, he wears big, baggy black clothing and lots of chains and rings. At one point, he was even dying coloured strips into his hair. I remember being so upset the first day I saw this. It was just so embarrassing to see my child walking around like that. Now, I don't have a problem with gay people or anything like that, but I never really wanted that type of thing to be a part of my own household. I've never confronted my son about his sexuality and I really just don't wanna know if he does happen to be. Our relationship is already sort of strained and I feel like if I found out he wasn't straight, it would make it very hard for me to treat him the same. Like I said, I don't have a problem with gay people. I just don't wanna be shoved in my face on top of everything. Ever since my son entered high school, he's made friends with mostly girls. At first I was glad to see this, and I was happy that my son still might have a chance of growing up into a real man's man. But as time went on, I realized that he wasn't in a relationship with any of these girls dead. They were all just his close friends. He constantly has his friends over the house and is part of a friend group with three other girls. To be fair, these girls have always been nothing but polite to me and my wife and are always respectful of our house. Still, it just rubs me the wrong way that my son doesn't seem to have any close guy friends. And I feel like it's not good for him to grow up that way. I tried my best to be non judgmental towards my son, even though to me he looked like more of a freak of nature. Every day the more he kept leaning into his alternative fashion. I didn't understand it, since all of his friends were normal girls. He was the only weirdo in his friend group who dressed like some 90s mall rat. When I look at him, he honestly reminds me of the kind of kids I would pick on in high school. Anyway, about a Year ago, I ran out of patience with him when he came home one day with his nails painted a shade of bright blue. My son had never done anything like this before, and I couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly disgusted. I. I told him that he had gone too far with his emo bullshit and that I couldn't continue letting him make a fool out of himself like this. I told him that at one point he needed to become a man, and painting his nails made him look like some sort of weak top. My son and I had never really been close. We didn't even speak that often, so he looked very hurt as I was telling him all this. But I couldn't help it. He had needed a reality check for so long and there was no avoiding this conversation. I told my son to go get nail polish remover and remove his nail polish right there in front of me. That's when he started to get angry and said that he didn't have to change himself just to appease my dumb homophobic self. My son has never spoken to either of his parents this way, and I knew that there was no way I was letting him get away with it. I yelled at him for cursing at me like that, and I told him that he would remove his nail polish immediately or there would be serious consequences. He said that there was nothing Worse I could do to him than continue being such a hateful father. And that's when I lost my shot. I told him that I would ground him for the entire year if he didn't remove his nail polish within the next 60 seconds. Looked at me and told me that I could try, but I would never be able to control him and that he hated me. He ran up to his room after this, and I followed through on my threat. I took his phone away and replaced it with a flip phone, and he wasn't allowed to go out or have his friends over anymore. All he did after that for the rest of the year was call his friends in his room and completely ignore me. One night, I overheard him crying to my wife about how much he hated his life since being grounded. But all she said was that I was his father and he needed to respect me. Proud of my wife for sticking up to me behind closed doors. And I still felt like I had made the right decision. I won't lie and say that it hasn't been a difficult year. My son stopped talking to me the day I grounded him, and I honestly do miss him. He graduates next year, and I just hope before then he'll realise that I was only ever trying to do what was best for him.

Where did you write down how to make Antonio's plate? Carlos is freaking out. I texted back, everything should be in the kitchen somewhere. There's nothing here. Just the regular menu recipes. Of course, there wasn't anything written down. All those special orders lived in my head, like Don Roberto's Saturday special with my secret salsa blend that took me three years to perfect. Or Maria's eggs with that specific combination of peppers she'd been ordering for 15 years. I knew exactly how much of each spice to use, which vendors sold the best chilies and how every regular like their tortillas toasted. At 8:30, Elena called me directly. Miguel, Don Roberto's whole family is here for their monthly gathering, 12 people, and they all want their usual orders. Roberto's asking for you specifically. I wish I could help, I said. And I really meant it because I like Don Roberto and his family. By 9:00am, owner Rosa Herrera called begging me to come back for triple pay. But I told her I'd already started at Lupita's Kitchen down the street. Elena texted that Don Roberto waited exactly 20 minutes before standing up with his entire 12 person family and announcing they were going to find wherever Miguel's cooking now. And within an hour, half the breakfast crowd had followed them to Lupita's. At noon, Carlos called accusing me of sabotage and theft. Those recipes are company property. What? Those were my creations from 12 years. Made with spices I bought myself and notes in my personal notebook. He threatened to sue, but I told him to check with Rosa about what belonged to the company and he hung up. That afternoon, Carlos posted on Facebook about exciting standardized menu improvements, but comments destroyed him, with customers asking where I went and saying they'd never come back. One lady wrote her mother had been coming for 30 years and Saturday was her first walk out. Monday, I was officially at Lupitas with a 45% raise plus a share of breakfast sales. Thursday, Elena texted that Carlos got fired after Rosa discovered he'd been stealing by lying about food costs and the community center switched their catering to Lupitas. Friday morning, Don Roberto sat at his new regular table while I served his Saturday special with extra jalapenos Miguel, he said with a big smile, this tastes just like it should.

Growing up, Haley never missed a chance to remind me I wasn't real family. Every sibling fight ended the same way. At least my parents actually wanted me from the start, instead of getting stuck with leftovers. It stung every single time. Our parents loved me. I knew that. But Haley's words planted seeds of doubt. Was I really chosen, or was I just convenient? When I was 15, something shifted. I overheard mom and dad talking about how they wish they could connect better with different cultures, especially after watching a Korean drama together. Mom sighed and said, I wish I could speak another language. It would open up so many conversations. That's when I got my idea. I started learning Korean in secret. Every night after homework, I'd use language apps with headphones. I found online tutor and told my parents the money was for school projects. I watched K dramas without subtitles, practice pronunciation until my jaw ached. Even started cooking Korean recipes I found online during weekends when everyone was out. Meanwhile, Haley was busy dating Daniel, this guy she met at community college. She'd constantly brag about how cultured and worldly he was because he'd spent a semester in Europe. She'd make snotty comments like, some people are naturally interesting, others are just basic, always looking right at me when she said it. What made it worse was That our parents seemed impressed by Daniel, too. They'd ask him about his travels, his experience, princes treating him like he was this sophisticated addition to our family dinners. Daniel was actually pretty nice to me, but Haley would always cut our conversation short. Don't bore him with your random interests, she say, rolling her eyes. The perfect opportunity came during Haley's graduation party from community college. She'd invited Daniel and insisted he bring his parents, who had immigrated from Korea when he was young. She wanted to show off her international boyfriend's family to all our relatives. But when Daniel's parents arrived, everything went sideways. They spoke very little English, and Daniel was really stressed trying to

I need extra hands. Yeah, I don't think so. I wasn't about to climb into a bathroom stall with a freak. No, please. I think I might bleed out. Her voice was shaking. And suddenly this wasn't funny anymore. It was summer from my English class, a pregnant senior who everyone whispered about but nobody really talked to. She was sitting on the toilet, gripping the handicap rail with white knuckles, and her face was covered in sweat. What's wrong? I asked, even though I was starting to guess. Please do something. I'm giving birth. She looked up at me with pure terror in her eyes. My whole body went cold. I was 17 and barely knew how tampons worked, let alone babies. But she was crying and alone, and I couldn't just leave her there. I hopped over the stall divider awkwardly and almost slipped on the wet floor. That's when I saw it. The baby was already crowning. There was blood on the toilet seat and the floor, and summer was making the low groaning sounds that scared me more than anything. This was actually happening in a gross school bathroom with fluorescent lights and graffiti on the walls. I'll be right back. I ran out of the bathroom. Still in shock. I sprinted down the hallway to Missus Bashar's classroom. She was my favourite teacher and The only adult I could think of who wouldn't freak out, I burst through her door, interrupting her lecture on photosynthesis. The whole class stared at me. I need your help urgently, please. I was out of breath and probably looked insane. Missus Bashar took one look at my face and followed me without asking questions. We ran back to the bathroom and I could hear summer sounds getting louder. Other kids were starting to peek out of classrooms wondering what was happening. Missus Bashar pushed open the stall door and immediately went into teacher mode. Okay, honey, I'm here. You're doing great. I'm going to support you while she gets the nurse. I didn't need to be told twice. I ran to the nurse's office faster than I'd ever run in PE. When I burst through the door, Nurse Patty was checking Casey's temperature. Casey, who everyone knew was Summer's boyfriend, the guy who'd been bragging about becoming a dad at prom. Summer's having her baby in the bathroom right now. I basically screamed it. Casey's face went from white to green. He threw up all over the floor before Nurse Patty could grab a trash can. But we didn't have time to deal with that. The three of us ran back to the bathroom with nurse Patty grabbing emergency supplies from her cabinet. By now, half the school had heard something was happening. Kids were crowding outside the bathroom door trying to figure out what all the screaming Was about teachers were trying to move them back to class, but nobody was listening. When we got back to the stall, it was chaos. Missus Bashar was holding Summer's hand while she pushed. The nurse immediately took over, checking how dilated she was and telling summer to breathe. Casey stood frozen in the doorway looking like he might pass out. That's when summer grabbed my hand and pulled me close. You have to get.

I care about my teenage boy, but I'd be dishonest if I said I wasn't let down by the kind of person he's becoming. My son began getting into this different look back when he was in middle school. At first, he just wore black clothes. But once he got to high school, he's gone way too far with his strange style and I really don't like it. My wife doesn't seem to mind, but she's a pretty passive woman and has never been a very strict parent like me. If I were to describe how my son dresses now, he wears big, baggy black clothing and lots of chains and rings. At one point, he was even dying coloured strips into his hair. I remember being so upset the first day I saw this. It was just so embarrassing to see my child walking around like that. Now, I don't have a problem with gay people or anything like that, but I never really wanted that type of thing to be a part of my own household. I've never confronted my son about his sexuality, and I really just don't wanna know. If he does happen to be gay, our relationship is already sort of strained. And I feel like if I found out he wasn't straight, it would make it very hard for me to treat him the same like I Said I don't have a problem with gay people. I just don't wanna be shoved in my face on top of everything. Ever since my son entered high school, he's made friends with mostly girls. At first I was glad to see this and I was happy that my son still might have a chance of growing up into a real man's man. But as time went on, I realised that he wasn't in a relationship with any of these girls dad. They were all just his close friends. He constantly has his friends over the house and is part of a friend group with 3 other girls. To be fair, these girls have always been nothing but polite to me and my wife and are always respectful of our house. Still, it just rubs me the wrong way that my son doesn't seem to have any close guy friends and I feel like it's not good for him to grow up that way. I tried my best to be non judgmental towards my son, even though to me he looked like more of a freak of nature every day the more he kept leaning into his alternative fashion. I didn't understand it since all of his friends were normal girls, he was the only weirdo in his friend group who dressed like some 90s mall rat. When I look at him, he honestly reminds me of the kind of kids I would pick on in high school anyway about A year ago, I ran out of patience with him when he came home one day with his nails painted a shade of bright blue. My son had never done anything like this before and I couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly disgusted. I told him that he had gone too far with his emo bullshit and that I couldn't continue letting him make a fool out of himself like this. I told him that at one point he needed to become a man and painting his nails made him look like some sort of weak top. My son and I had never really been close. We didn't even speak that often. So he looked very hurt as I was telling him all this. But I couldn't help it. He had needed a reality check for so long and there was no avoiding this conversation. I told my son to go get nail polish remover and remove his nail polish right there in front of me. That's when he started to get angry and said that he didn't have to change himself just to appease my dumb, a homophobic son. My son has never spoken to either of his parents this way and I knew that there was no way I was letting him get away with it. I yelled at him for cursing at me like that and I told him that he would remove his nail polish immediately or there would be serious consequences. He said that there was Nothing worse I could do to him than continue being such a hateful father. And that's when I lost my shot. I told him that I would ground him for the entire year if he didn't remove his nail polish. Within the next 60 seconds, looked at me and told me that I could try, but I would never be able to control him and that he hated me. He ran up to his room after this and I followed through on my threat. I took his phone away and replaced it with a flip phone and he wasn't allowed to go out or have his friends over anymore. All he did after that for the rest of the year was call his friends in his room and completely ignore me. One night I overheard him crying to my wife about how much he hated his life since being grounded. But all she said was that I was his father and he needed to respect me. Proud of my wife for sticking up to me behind closed doors. And I still felt like I had made the right decision. I won't lie and say that it hasn't been a difficult year. My son stopped talking to me the day I grounded him and I honestly do miss him. He graduates next year and I just hope before then he'll realise that I was only ever trying to do what was best for him.

We ran back to the bathroom and I could hear summer sounds getting louder. Other kids were starting to peek out of classrooms wondering what was happening. Missus Bashar pushed open the stall door and immediately went into teacher mode. Okay, honey, I'm here. You're doing great. I'm going to support you while she gets the nurse. I didn't need to be told twice. I ran to the nurse's office faster than I'd ever run in PE. When I burst through the door, Nurse Patty was checking Casey's temperature. Casey, who everyone knew was Summer's boyfriend, the guy who'd been bragging about becoming a dad at prom. Summer's having her baby in the bathroom right now. I basically screamed it. Casey's face went from white to green. He threw up all over the floor before Nurse Patty could grab a trash can. But we didn't have time to deal with that. The three of us ran back to the bathroom with nurse Patty grabbing emergency supplies from her cabinet. By now, half the school had heard something was happening. Kids were crowding outside the bathroom doors trying to figure out what all the screaming Was about out. Teachers were trying to move them back to class, but nobody was listening. When we got back to the stall, it was chaos. Missus Bashar was holding Summer's hand while she pushed. The nurse immediately took over, checking how dilated she was and telling summer to breathe. Casey stood frozen in the doorway looking like he might pass out. That's when summer grabbed my hand and pulled me close. You have to get.

So I decided to make them both pay for their betrayal. I found out on a Tuesday. Sophie called in tears, voice shaking so hard I thought someone had died. She sat in her car outside our house, gripping the steering wheel like she was about to crash it. I'm pregnant, she said. For three seconds, I smiled. We've been talking about kids for months. And she added, it might not be yours. Silence. The air around me turned thick. My throat burned. Who? I asked. But I already knew. Her eyes darted away. It wasn't supposed to. Tell me. It's not Alex. The sound she made wasn't even a word. That was all the answer I needed. I staggered out of the car, knees barely working. She chased me, babbling excuses. Late nights. One mistake. She never meant to hurt me. My ears roared. Three months. Four. She swallowed, nodded. I drove straight to the office. My. My brother was there, smug as ever, wearing new Cologne like a cheap disguise. When he saw my face, he knew. Listen, bro, I can explain. My fist landed before the sentence finished. Blood shot from his nose. The room filled with the metallic smell of it, sharp and sour. Dad and two employees pulled me off. Alex shrieked like a coward. She came on to me. We're in love. Those words echoed in the Walls like poison. Mom pressed her hands to her mouth. Janet, our receptionist for 15 years, grabbed her purse and walked out without a word. That silence said more than anything. Dad raised his hands like a judge calling order. His voice was heavy but calm in that fake way he always used when he thought he was the only adult in the room. We'll handle this like adults. Alex spat blood onto the floor, then grinned through it. Teeth red. She's having my baby. You can't ignore that. The room spun. I looked at dad, he looked at Alex, then at me. We'll figure this out. Family is family. I left a week later.

But Karma served him something he couldn't swallow. Carlos showed up at Rose's Cantina in February with his restaurant management certificate, and right away he started changing everything we've been doing for years. He walked around with a smug attitude, telling everyone the kitchen was disorganized and that we needed to follow modern systems instead of the old ways. After two months of his nonsense, he called me into the main dining room while the whole lunch crew was watching. Miguel, we need to make some changes around here, he announced loud enough for everyone to hear. You refused to follow corporate procedures, so I'm letting you go. You're done. Clear out your things. I've been the head cook at roses for 12 years, and I knew every single regular customer by name and exactly how they like their food. But I just nodded quietly and went to get my stuff. The waitresses all stood there frozen. And Elena, who'd been there almost as long as he, had tears running down her face. As I was walking out with my things, I stopped and said over my shoulder, hope the weekend breakfast rush goes smooth for you. Carlos just waved his hand like it didn't matter. Any trained cook can handle eggs and beans, smiled to myself, Mother's Day weekend is coming up. Should be interesting. His confident expression flickered for just a second. What about Mother's Day? Oh, Nothing special, I said, heading for the door. Just our busiest three days of the year. All the families come in with their special orders. You'll be fine. What Carlos didn't know was that Mother's Day weekend at roses was like the Super Bowl for us. Families would pack the place from Friday through Sunday and every single regular family had their own special way they wanted their breakfast. I've been preparing special seasoned meats for weeks that customers have been asking about, marinating them just right with my own blend of spices I perfected over the years. Carlos had never bothered to learn any of this stuff because he was too busy talking about portion control and standardized recipes. Our customers were families who'd been coming for generations and wanted their food exactly how they remembered it from when their parents brought them as kids. Saturday morning came and at 6:00am sharp, my phone started going off. I ignored it and made myself some coffee. By 6:45, Carlos had called eight times. At 7:15, Elena texted me.

She suddenly became a food critic. My girlfriend insisted I cook for her roommate's birthday dinner at our apartment. I been planning the menu all week, but she kept reminding me not to go overboard with the fancy stuff, because Lexi preferred simple food. The second I started prepping in the kitchen, setting up my knees on place and heating the cast iron, my girlfriend grabbed her phone and sprawled on the couch. I'm ordering sushi for myself, she announced without looking up. Your food's always too heavy. I watched her scroll through TikTok while I worked on the carbonara from scratch, making fresh pasta and whisking eggs with Eccarino Romano. Smells incredible in here, said a voice from the doorway. Lexi had come home early from work, dark hair pulled back, still in her office clothes, the type who actually appreciated effort when she saw it. Oh, my god, she said, moving closer to the stove. Are you making pasta from scratch? She actually watched me work, not the polite glance people usually give. I didn't know guys our age even knew how to cook like this. My ex could barely make cereal. We started talking about food while I finished the dish. She traveled through Italy last summer. Rome, Florence, Bologna. Real interest, asking about techniques and ingredients. Have you always cooked like this? Lexi asked, leaning against the counter. I'd love to learn Sometime. Your girlfriend is so lucky. My chest tightened. My girlfriend had never once asked to learn anything I made. Not once in two years of dating. I'd even catered her office party last month and she'd introduce the food as something we picked up. Does she eat my food? I asked. Lexi's expression shifted slightly. Well, she mentioned you cook a lot. She paused. Actually, now that I think about it, I've never seen her eat anything you've made. She's always getting take out when we hang out. That hit harder than expected. I cooked five nights a week and ate most meals alone. Lexi must have seen something in my face because she stepped closer. That's her loss. This looks restaurant quality. It's nothing special, I said, plating the carbonara from the living room. I caught my girlfriend glancing over while pretending to watch Netflix.

Before Grandpa was even buried, Maxwell left Amanda control of the true estate, $24 million, plus the intellectual property rights that should have made him a billionaire. But she must decide. Pursue criminal charges for the fraud or implement an alternative plan. Mom! Scream echoed across the lake. I chose option 2. No criminal charges, but the trust would fund environmental conservation with strict ethical oversight. My parents kept their properties, but faced conditions. Family counseling, community service with environmental organizations, and honesty. And if we refuse? Dad challenged. Your portion redirects to charity, Langford answered. Caroline surprised everyone. I accept all of it. I'm tired of the lies. Six months later, the Maxwell Riley Foundation thrives. We funded conservation projects and established scholarships. Caroline volunteers teaching financial literacy to teens. My parents struggled, but dad eventually called about the Watershed Project. It's actually interesting. Mom took longer. At a family session, she pulled out a photo of herself as a girl on Grandpa's shoulders. He taught me to be brave, she whispered.

The next day she went to the mall with her friends and came home with a twenty thousand dollar Rolex. She was showing it off on Instagram, posting photos, acting like she'd earned it herself. When my parents got home three days later, my dad was going through his credit card statements and saw the charge. She came storming into the living room and I'll never forget a look on his face. He called both of us downstairs. My mom was standing there with her arms crossed, looking angrier than I'd ever seen her. Which one of you spent $20,000 on my card? My dad yelled. My sister just stood there silent, staring at the floor. My dad turned to me. Why didn't you stop? You're the responsible one. You should have been watching her. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I told her not to do it. I warned her to call you first. My mom jumped in. Well, clearly you didn't try hard enough. Then my dad said the words that made me snap. Since you're the responsible one and this is partially your fault for not stopping her. You're going to use your college fund to pay this back. We need to keep this family together. I just stare. At him. Then I started laughing. Not a happy laugh. The kind of laugh you do when something is so ridiculous you can't believe it's real. No, I said. I'm not paying back anything. My dad's face turned red. Excuse me? I got accepted to three universities last month. All of them offered me full academic scholarships. I never needed your money anyway. The room went completely silent. My mom whispered, you applied to colleges? Yeah. You never asked. I walked upstairs, packed a bag and called my aunt.

I've arranged tasks that must be completed before the full estate terms are implemented. Amanda, the envelope contains the key to my lakehouse. Go there immediately. And remember, things aren't always as they appear. Sometimes a single dollar is worth more than millions. Mom's mask cracked. Amanda will naturally accompany. No, I interrupted. Grandpa said I go alone. At the lakehouse, I found his study unlocked. Inside, a notebook detailing his true holdings. Over $24 million. A letter to me to investigate Riley Innovations. Within hours, I uncovered everything. In the 1990s, Grandpa had founded a tech company with revolutionary patents. My father, handling legal work, advised him a competing patent would make it worthless. He recommended immediate sale. Grandpa sold for a fraction of its value. Six months later, the buyer made billions using his designs. No competing patent ever emerged. The most damning detail. Mom worked in acquisitions at the buying company. They orchestrated the theft together, pocketing nearly half a million in hidden fees. Grandpa discovered the truth five years ago. That's when he restructured everything.

I studied every night while my sister went out with her rich friends. Last month, everything blew up. My parents announced they were leaving town for a week for some business. This conference. They left us $150 for food and emergencies. That was it. The day after they left, my sister came home furious. Apparently, one of her friends had been showing off her designer watch collection at lunch. And my sister couldn't stand that someone had something she didn't. She spent the next two days asking all her friends about watches and researching brands online. Then She came into my room and said, I know where dad keeps his credit cards. Should I borrow one? I looked at her like she was insane. Are you serious? No. Absolutely not. If you want something that expensive, call dad and ask him. She rolled her eyes. What's the worst that can happen? I'll just say it was an emergency. I shook my head. Do whatever you want, but keep me completely out of it. I'm not covering for you this time.

It was unlocked and there was a family group chat open. My hands were shaking as I read through the messages. Matt had been planning this for weeks. Parents were selling their house. They'd be moving in at the end of the month. His mom even made a joke about selling my desk set up since she won't be needing an office anyway, she travels for work so much. They were laughing about it, making plans to convert my space into a bedroom. Matt said I'd get over it eventually and that I was too focused on work anyway. I felt sick. This was my home too.

There was Matt, his dad and his brother. Evan. My monitors were already disconnected. My desk was halfway disassembled. Everything was being loaded into boxes labeled storage.

He started yelling about how irresponsible I was being with money, how we could have used that for something practical, how I was being selfish. I just stared at him. Then I said, Matt, I make $180,000 a year here. Now this is 1% of my salary. His mouth dropped open. He had no idea. I guess I forgot to mention the exact number when I told him about the job. From that moment on, he gave me complete silence. Wouldn't talk to me at breakfast, wouldn't respond to my texts, would leave the room when I walked in. It was like living with a ghost. But then things got weirder. My stuff started disappearing. First, it was my favorite hoodie from college. I asked Matt about it, and he said he donated it because it was old and ratty. I was annoyed, but didn't think much of it. Then my running shoes vanished. He said he gave them to his brother. They were $150 shoes I'd bought two months ago. Next was my expensive noise cancelling headphones. I use them for work calls. When I asked where they were, Matt casually said his dad needed headphones, so he gave them to him. I told him he couldn't just take my stuff without asking. He shrugged and said, you make enough money to replace them. I was furious, but Didn't want to fight. I just bought new ones. One night last week, I woke up around 2:00am. Matt wasn't in bed. I could hear him talking on the phone in the living room. I stayed quiet and listened. He was talking to his sister, and what I heard made my blood run cold. Yeah? I'm moving mom and dad in next month. He said she doesn't know yet, but she'll deal with it. We've got three rooms. One is mine, one is hers.

At one point, his mom called up, honey, do you want me to wash your gym clothes? And his dad called back, that would be amazing. Thank you, babe. And I sat there staring at my biology textbook, trying to process that interaction. In my house, that would have become, I'm not your servant, and I work 60 hours a week. Is it too much to ask for clean clothes? When Eli's dad drove me home, I watched him text his wife, love you at a red light just because he felt like it. Standing outside my apartment building, I could already hear my parents through the open window three floors up, my dad was screaming, maybe if you weren't such a controlling psycho, I wouldn't have to hide things from you, while my mom shrieked back, I'm controlling because you're a pathological liar who can't be trusted with anything! Eli's dad pretended not to notice, but he turned the radio up slightly and asked if I needed anything else for the project. When I shook my head, he said, you're welcome over anytime. Eli really likes having study partners, and the way he emphasized anytime made me realize he understood exactly what he was offering me. The moment I walked through our apartment door, my mom grabbed my arm and demanded to know where I've been, because Dad said I wasn't at the library like I told her. My dad yelled from the kitchen that he never said that, and she was making things up again to start another fight. Within seconds, they were screaming at each other, and I was completely forgotten, standing there in the doorway, thinking about how Eli's mom had laughed at his dad's terrible puns. My mom turned to me and said, tell your father that if he wants to eat tonight, he can make his own damn food. And my dad shot back, tell your mother I'd rather starve than eat anything she touches. I looked at both of them, and for the first time in my life, I said, tell each other yourselves, because I'm done being your messenger.

Nobody screamed about being careless or brought up every other mistake from the past five years. Eli asked if his friend could stay for dinner, and his parents looked at each other for maybe half a second for saying yes together like they shared a brain. At my house, that question would have started World War 3. About money and whose turn it was to cook and why one parent always had to be the bad guy. During dinner, his parents asked about our days and actually listened to the answers instead of waiting for ammunition for their next fight. His dad mentioned forgetting to grab milk on the way home, and his mom just said, I'll grab some tomorrow when I'm out anyway. That was it. No lecture about responsibility or memory or how she has to do everything herself. They disagreed about something political they heard on the news, but they were actually discussing it like human beings instead of going for the jugular. His mom said, that's actually a good point. I hadn't thought about It that way. And I literally almost choked on my pasta because I never heard either of my parents admit they might be wrong about anything, ever.

I Learned to recognize the warning signs before I could even read properly. The way my dad's jaw would tighten when he walked through the door meant mom was about to bring up the credit card Bill. The way mom would slam cabinet doors meant dad had forgotten something important. And by the time I was 12, I could predict their fights down to the minute, and I'd already have my headphones ready with the volume cranked up until my ears hurt, just to drown out the sound of them screaming about who ruined whose life. First, Eli from my biology class asked if I wanted to come over after school to work on our project. I almost made up an excuse. Going to other people's houses meant eventually they'd want to come to mine, and there was no way I could explain why my mom was sleeping in the guest room permanently or why they were dense in the hallway walls from thrown objects that missed their targets. But we had a huge presentation due, and Eli lived walking distance from school, which meant I wouldn't need to ask either parent for a ride and deal with 20 minutes of them using me as a weapon against each other. My mom would say, tell your father he needs to put gas in the car if he's going to use it all weekend, while my dad would respond, Tell your mother I wouldn't need the car if she hadn't made me sleep in a motel last Tuesday. Walking into Eli's house felt like stepping through a portal into some alternate universe where families actually functioned. His parents were both in the kitchen when we arrived, instead of the tense silence that meant someone was about to explode, they were laughing about something that happened at his mom's work.

What? I said, looking up from my phone. What are you talking about? Is this a joke? My brother? Isaac asked, laughing a little. Erica slammed her butter knife down. I'm serious. Someone's been living in my attic. Food keeps disappearing from my kitchen. I hear footsteps at night. Things get moved around. One of you has been staying up there? My mother frowned. Erica, Honey, none of us have been to your house in weeks. Someone has, Erica insisted. I found blankets up there this morning, empty water bottles, granola bar wrappers. Someone's been living in my house. That's creepy, Isaac said, no longer laughing. You sure it's not Victor sleepwalking or something? Victor's been with me every night, Erica said. And Colby's been at basketball camp half the month. It's someone else. Someone with a key. My father pushed his plate away. Erica, if someone's really been in your house, you need to call the police. I'm not calling the police on my own family, Erica said. Just tell me. Maybe someone needed space. Maybe there's problems at home I don't know about. I won't be mad. Erica, this is ridiculous, I said. Why would any of us secretly live in your attic? She pulled out her phone. Look at this. She showed us a photo of her attic corner with blankets arranged like a bed, water bottles lined Up against the wall, a pile of what looked like clothes. Isaac leaned over to see. Okay, that's definitely weird, but it's not us. Then who is it? Erica's voice was getting higher. Who else has access to my house? My mother stood up. We're going over there right now. All of us. We all drove to Erica's place.

I didn't respond. Two days later, I contested the refinance. James called, they froze the money. And Jeremy got pulled over in your truck on a suspended license. Had stolen prescription pads from Becky's dental office. The bank investigator showed me transfer records. Multiple payments to Daniel Spencer, a real estate agent. She was selling our house. James ran a check. Spencer's done business with Jeremy before. Jeremy has a pattern. Gets involved with women with deployed spouses. Sells their homes below market, takes a cut. Moves on three cases so far. Other military families. I've contacted the FBI. Agent Patel wanted my statement. Your case establishes a pattern, shows intent. Organization makes it concern. The next day, Becky texted, asking to meet. I didn't go. James and I parked near our house. Becky left at 9:45. At 10:05, Daniel Spencer arrived. Jeremy met him. I pulled up my security feed. They were inside, Spencer taking photos, Jeremy pointing out features. Should list by end of week. Spencer said, I've got a buyer. Cash offer. What about the husband? Spencer waved dismissively. Military guys are all the same. They make noise, but they've got deployments. He'll take a settlement. I forwarded the feed to Agent Patel. Happening now. Thirty minutes later, FBI vehicles surrounded our house. Spencer and Jeremy let out in handcuffs. Becky arrived, hands over mouth, watching agents carry boxes from our house. Jeremy and Spencer took Plea deals in locating a three state operation targeting military families. 11 families total. Jeremy got eight years, Spencer got 12. Becky agreed to full restitution, forfeiture of claims to the house or pension. Signed confession in exchange. I didn't press charges. Divorce finalized six months after that email from Kandahar. Agent Patel called a year later. Those 11 families are getting their money back because of you. I got a letter from a Navy wife in Fort Worth. Jeremy and Spencer had tried the same scheme. You don't know me, she wrote, but you saved our home. Thank you for fighting back when it would have been easier to walk away. I heard Becky moved back to Oregon, working at another dental office. Starting over. I didn't hate her anymore. Didn't feel much of anything. She thought understood meant I'd given up. It just meant I was done talking

I needed to handle this the right way. If I confronted him, he'd deny it. If I waited too long, he'd act like it had always been his. I copied the footage onto a flash drive and went straight to the city's property department. When I got there, I explained what happened. The guy at the counter gave me a look, the kind people give when they think you're exaggerating. Then I pulled out the house plans. Then I showed him the footage. He watched in silence. Then he picked up the phone. Within hours, a city inspector was at my house. He measured everything, compared it to the official records, check the footage, took a ton of pictures. And then he made some calls. By the afternoon, I had official confirmation my neighbour was in serious violation of city codes. And the best part? His car was parked on my stolen property. The inspector made a call. Thirty minutes later, a tow truck pulled up. I was outside when my neighbour ran out, still in his slippers, watching his car get hooked up. What the hell are you doing? He Shouted at me. I crossed my arms, taking my driveway back. He looked around, saw the city inspector, saw the officials. His face went pale. You can't just tow my car, he yelled. It's on my property! I said. The inspector cut him off. You moved the property line. That's illegal. You need to remove everything you built onto his land immediately. My neighbor stammered, trying to argue, saying I didn't understand how property lines work, that I must have been confused. Then I pulled out my house plans in the footage. He shut up real fast.

Had I made a mistake? Was there some kind of property shift I didn't know about? Had I signed something and forgotten? No, that wasn't possible. I needed proof. The next day, I went out and bought a small security camera. Nothing fancy, just something I could stick inside my garage window facing the driveway. If anything happened, I'd have it on video. And then I waited. A week passed. Nothing happened. I started to wonder if I'd been wrong. Maybe I really was just bad at parking. Then one night, I checked the footage, and I saw something that made my blood boil. At 2:00am, my neighbor walked into my driveway. He Looked around, making sure no one was watching. Then a truck pulled. A crew of guys got out, and right there in the dead of night, they started working on his driveway. But they weren't fixing it. They were expanding it onto mine.

Nothing fancy, but it's mine. When I bought it, I made sure everything was documented properly. Property lines, ease it's boundaries, all the legal stuff. I didn't want problems down the road. My driveway was clearly mine, my neighbor's fence was his, and the space between was a clear boundary. Simple, no problems. Till one day I pulled into my driveway and something felt wrong. At first I thought maybe I was imagining things. My driveway felt narrower. I wasn't sure why, but I had to park closer to my garage door than usual. It wasn't a big deal. Maybe I just parked weird. That day. I let it go. Then it happened again and again. A few months passed and every time I came home it felt worse. I started second guessing myself. Was I losing my mind?

Until one morning when I was pulling out and my tire hit something. A hard edge that was completely new. I got out and looked. There was a fresh strip pavement along the edge of my Driveway blending into mine like it had always been there. But it hadn't. I squatted down, running my hand over it.

She emptied our joint account and moved her new boyfriend into our house. I responded calmly, understood. When she realized what I had done, it was already too late. The email came while I was in Kandahar. Subject? Let's be adults about this. Three sentences. She'd filed the paperwork, emptied our joint account, moved Jeremy into our house. 13 years of marriage ended in a PDF. I read it twice, closed my laptop, said nothing to anyone. That night. I replied, understood. Truth is, I wasn't surprised. 6 months before deployment, things had changed. New clothes, late nights, gym membership she never used. I didn't confront her. That's not who I am. But I made quiet moves. Secured documents in a storage unit. House deed with only my name thanks to the VA loan. Opened a separate account. Diverted part of my pay. Not enough she'd notice, but enough. I wouldn't start from zero. What she didn't know was that I'd prepare. And I never start fights. But I finish them. Two weeks later, $88,500 withdrawn. Everything gone. Balance twenty two dollars and sixty seven cents. I called the bank. Becky had been moving money for weeks. Big transfers started the day after I deployed. I logged into our home security system. Something Becky forgot I could access. Strange truck in my driveway. A man using my coffee mug, wearing my Seahawks sweatshirt. Walking my dog. And Becky laughing. In the kitchen I'd renovated, something cold settled in my chest. I made a list. Called James. Army buddy turned lawyer. Check VA loan terms, review refinance documents. This wasn't about emotion. This was strategy. At 0 500, I emailed James. Need legal help? Urgent. Two months later, I was stateside. Didn't tell Becky. Checked into a motel under a different name. James met me with a folder. Found something interesting. A refinance application with my signature. Except it wasn't mine. Middle initial, wrong stroke pattern off. Becky forged it three months ago. Used the equity to pull $165,000. Your signature is required for VA loans. So she faked it. And she listed her boyfriend as co applicant. He's got two DUIs and a fraud charge. I showed the bank my military ID, my real signature, the forged documents. His face went pale. I've already filed a police report.

She gave me the address. I have texts. The man yelled at me to stay where I was and called 9 1 1. I was crying at this point, trying to pull up Jen's messages on my phone to prove I wasn't some crazy burglar. The cops showed up in, like, five minutes. Two officers, one older guy and a younger woman. They asked for my ID and started going through my phone. I showed them everything. Jen's texts, the address, the pictures of the dog. The older cop squinted at the screen. This says 54B Oakridge Court. You're on Oakridge Lane. My stomach dropped. Court Lane. I'd gone to the wrong street. I looked at the couple. I'm so sorry. I swear I thought this was the right house. The woman was crying now, too. You've been here all weekend? You slept here? You fed our dog there? Dog? Not Daisy, their dog. Turns out they've been out of town visiting their daughter. They came home early because their flight got moved up. And I've been living in their house, eating their food, walking their dog, posting pictures online like some psycho. The younger cop asked if anything was missing. The couple checked and said no, but the man kept saying she was In our home, she slept in our bed even though I didn't. I slept in the guest room, but he wasn't listening because I'd use their key, eaten their food, stayed multiple nights, and posted online from inside their house. They said it counted as trespassing and unlawful occupancy. Officer told me I was being arrested. I started sobbing, still in my pajamas. They cuffed me right there in the living room. At the station, I called Jen, freaking out. She didn't answer at first because she was still at the wedding. When she finally called back, she was confused as hell. She confirmed the address was Oakridge Court, not Lane, and said her neighbor had been watching Daisy the whole time. She had to drive three hours to come explain everything in person. Even then, I still got charged. I had to go to court twice. Couple didn't press charges for theft, but I got fined for trespassing. Almost $800. Jen felt awful and gave me the hundred bucks anyway, but it didn't even cover a quarter of what I owed. I had to pick up extra shifts for two months just to pay it off. My mugshot's still online if you search my name.

I was 23, working at this diner called Bonnie's, making barely enough to cover rent. My coworker Jen asked if I could house sit for the weekend while she went to her cousin's wedding. She'd pay me a hundred bucks to watch her golden retriever, Daisy. I'd never house sat before, but a hundred bucks for watching T V. And hanging with a dog? Easy money. Jen texted me the address Friday morning. 54B Oakridge Lane. He said the key would be under the mat. Simple enough. I packed a bag with snacks, my laptop, and way too many clothes for two nights. I drove over around seven PM. The house was nice. Nothing fancy, but clean. I found the key right where she said, under this ugly brown mat with a pineapple on it. When I walked in, I noticed it smelled kind of weird. Not bad, just different. Like old lady perfume mixed with lemon cleaner. I figured maybe Jen's grandma lived there before or something. There were no pictures of Jen anywhere, which I thought was strange, but maybe she just moved in. People are weird about decorating. I opened the back door and this golden retriever came running up, tail wagging like crazy. I assumed it was Daisy. The dog was super friendly, jumping all over me, licking my hands. I fed her from the bag of dog food I found in The pantry filled up her water bowl and we chilled on the couch watching Netflix. Everything felt normal. I slept in the guest room that night. The bed was stiff and smelled like mothballs, but whatever. Saturday morning I woke up and took the dog for a walk around the neighborhood. She pulled on the leash the whole time, but she was sweet. I even stopped and took pictures of her sniffing flowers and posted them on Instagram with the caption Daisy's Weekend Adventures. A few people liked it. I felt proud, like I was nailing this house sitting thing. I made myself a sandwich for lunch using their bread and Turkey from the fridge. It tasted fine, but there was this expired yogurt in the back that made me gag when I opened it. I tossed it. Figured I was doing Jenna a favor. Monday afternoon I was on the couch in my pajamas watching some true crime show when I heard the front door unlock. I froze. This older couple, probably in their 60s, walked in carrying suitcases. They saw me and literally screamed. The man dropped his.

So I'm in my 50s, and I bought this house in the Bay Area, like, 30 years ago for $230,000. Back then, nobody wanted to live here. Now it's worth over a million because of all the tech people moving in. I got insanely lucky with the timing. My daughter Camilla is 23. She grew up in this house. Every room has a memory. Her height marks are still on the kitchen door frame. She moved out last year to live with her boyfriend, but, like, obviously the house was always going to be hers someday. We never sat down and had some formal conversation about it, but come on, she's my only kid. Who else would get it? Here's the thing about my neighborhood. Now there's only two houses left that aren't owned by people making six figures in tech. Mine and my neighbor Jim, who bought around the same time I did. Everyone else, software engineers, people who work at Google. Camilla works as a hair stylist. She loves her job, but let's be real, she can't afford to buy anything here. Without this house, she'd have to move, like, two hours away just to afford rent. Two years ago, I met Steven. He's great. He has two kids from his previous marriage, both in elementary school. And I actually love those kids. I was excited about becoming a stepmom to them. We started talking about getting Married and combining our lives completely. Steven brought up finances and I agreed we should merge everything. But I told him I wanted a prenup specifically for the house. The house goes to Camilla no matter what. Non negotiable. He got quiet. Then he said he thought a million dollars split three ways between all the kids would be fair. Give everyone like 300,000 each to start their lives. I said, no. I paid 80% of that mortgage by myself over 30 years. Camilla is my daughter. This is her inheritance. With this house, she can keep working as a hair stylist and actually live in the area she grew up in. Without it, she's priced out of her own home. Steven said I was being unfair to his kids. Camilla was getting a massive advantage and his children would get nothing from me. I reminded him that I've known his kids for two years. I've known Camilla for 23 years. I carried her, I raised her alone. The house is hers. He said, if we're really becoming a family, then all the kids should be treated equally. I said, they are being treated equally in every other way. But this house is Camilla's. It always has been. We fought about it for weeks. I kept saying, 300,000 each is still life changing money. I kept saying, Camilla loses her ability to live in her own hometown if we do that. She'd have to move somewhere cheaper and start over. I finally called Camilla and asked her directly what she thought. She said she'd always assumed the house was hers. She'd been planning her future around it. She wants to stay in the area, maybe open her own salon someday. And she can only do that if she has the house. Steven overheard that conversation. He got mad and said Camilla was being selfish. I told him to stop. This is between me and my daughter. He said, if I go through with the prenup, then maybe we shouldn't get married at all. I said, then maybe we shouldn't. I told Steven the prenup happens or the wedding doesn't. He moved out last week. He took his kids stuff from my house and said I made my choice.

I spent my teenage years watching Ulyssa destroy cars while I begged for rides to work. On her 16th birthday, our parents surprised her with a brand new white BMW wrapped in a giant red bow. I stood there in the driveway, 17 years old, holding my bus pass. So when's my turn? I asked. Mom didn't even look at me. Andrea, you know you're not ready for that kind of responsibility. You still haven't proven yourself since you broke that lamp when you were 12. Look how well you Lisa takes care of her things. You Lisa dangled the keys in front of me. Yeah, maybe when you stop being such a mess. I had to take a bus everywhere I went that summer. And it didn't help that you Lisa would drive by the bus stop just to yell, hey, Andrea! Still taking the bus like a middle schooler. Her friends would laugh. Once, during a thunderstorm, she literally drove through a puddle to soak me. I got written up for showing up late and dripping wet. My manager said I should have left earlier to account for weather. After three months, I had $2,000 saved. I showed my parents the bank statement. Could you maybe match this? Like a really old Toyota or something? Dad barely glanced at it. That's college money, not car money. You're being short sighted. Five days later, Ulyssa crashed The BMW into our own mailbox. Checking Instagram. Parents had it fixed by the weekend. Few months after that, she rear ended an old lady at a red light. Everyone makes mistakes, mom said. Writing another check. That's how we learn. Meanwhile, I was catching three buses to get to community college, up at 4:00am for an 8:00am class. Ulyssa would always text, sorry you're still stuck with public transportation. Maybe show them.

Ulyssa would always text, sorry, you're still stuck with public transportation. Maybe show them you can handle. Nice thing I finally bought a car for 18 dollars. It was held together with duct tape and prayers, but it was mine. The engine knocked, the AC didn't work, and it leaked oil everywhere. Ulyssa called it the homeless mobile. I started watching YouTube videos at night, learning how to fix engines. First I changed the oil myself, then the brake pads. Within 6 months, I rebuilt the entire engine in our driveway, while ulyssa complained my tools were ugly and lowering property values. But my car ran perfectly. And I loved working on cars so much that I started fixing my friends cars for cash. Twenty bucks for an oil change, fifty for brakes. My phone wouldn't stop buzzing with requests. Of course, Ulyssa hadn't changed one bit. She got her third car after totaling the BMW completely. A Mercedes this time. I'm just not good with maintenance, she'd say. While our parents paid for everything, I rented a garage space and opened a small shop. Words spread fast about the girl who could fix any. By 25, I owned three shops and had 12 employees. I collected classic cars as a hobby, restoring them in my free time. Yulisa still lived at home. At 28, her Mercedes repossessed after our parents finally cut her off. She bounced between retail jobs, getting fired for calling in sick to go shopping. Last month, yulisa showed up at my house. She never comes here. She stood at my door with this weird smile, looking at my drive.

She kept touching my arm, complimenting everything. My couch, my kitchen, even my doormat. I crossed my arms. What do you want, Ulyssa? Her fake smile got bigger. Can't I just visit my successful sister? She walked toward the garage, peeking through the window. Wow. And cars. That's amazing. You know, I was thinking, you have so many, and I have none. You should give me one. Like today. I actually laughed. Give you one? Exactly. The Tesla would be perfect. Or the Porsche. You have seven. You won't even miss it. Ulyssa, those cars cost more than you've made in your entire life. So? Oh, family helps family. Like how you helped me when I was taking three buses to school. Her face went red. She pulled out her phone and called mom, putting it on speaker. Mom, I'm at Andrea's. He has seven cars and won't give me even one. Mom's voice filled my garage. Andrea, is that true? I worked for them. Mom, she's your sister, and she needs help. Give one to her. The audacity! She's too irresponsible for my nice cars. Ulyssa grabbed the phone. She's being cruel. That's exactly what you all said to me, remember? I needed to learn responsibility first. The silence. Stretched, Ulyssa's mouth flung open. Mom finally spoke. It's different, Andrea. How? They couldn't answer. You know what? Actually, I'll help you. About time. Her eyes on the Porsche. I'll text you the bus schedule. Line 12 runs every hour. She stormed out and took a bus home.

When I was 13, my family moved from Texas to this tiny town in Ontario, Canada. I was super nervous about starting over at a new school, so I came up with what I thought was the most genius plan ever. On my first day, I walked into homeroom and introduced myself with the thickest, most ridiculous fake British accent you've ever heard. I told everyone I was from Birmingham, England, even though I had never even been on a plane before that moved to Canada. The accent was absolutely terrible, like a mix of Harry Potter and some random YouTube videos I'd watched the night before, but somehow it actually worked. At first all the kids thought I was so cool and worldly. They kept asking me to say random words just to hear my accent. I got invited to birthday parties, added to group chats, and even asked to sleepovers. Teachers loved having me share my global perspective in class. I had never gotten this much attention before in my entire life, and honestly, it was addictive. But keeping up the lie was exhausting. I had to remember to use the accent everywhere. In the hallways, talking to teachers, even when neighbors saw me outside. I would literally pretend to talk to my nan on the phone just to practice in public. Every night I'd stay up googling British slang and watching videos trying to Sound more natural. Then things got really bad. Halfway through the year, this new girl named Ella joined our class. She was sweet, funny, and had the most beautiful, natural British accent I'd ever heard. She was actually from Manchester. My heart.

He cut me off and pulled out this thick leather wallet waving around some gold business card. I'm the president of Harrington Development. I built half the condos in this city. I stayed professional, told him he was going 30 over, nearly hit a Honda when he merged without looking. Instead of cooperating, he leans back and starts talking into his Bluetooth.

I asked for his license, registration and insurance. He threw them at me through the window, rolled his eyes. It's a demo car. They let me take it. Do you know how many Bmws I've bought? I walked back to my cruiser and ran everything. That's when things got Interesting, the plates came back registered to Bavarian Motors, not to him. Insurance didn't match either. So I called.

My wife Haley, was 28 when they found a tumor wrapped around her brain stem like a parasite. Three surgeons said removing it would kill her, and I held her hand in waiting rooms while she planned what song she wanted at her funeral. Then Doctor Eric looked at her scans for an hour and said, I can save you. Haley cried in my arms that night for the first time since diagnosis. The surgery lasted 14 hours, and when Doctor Eric found me in the waiting room, his scrubs were soaked with sweat, but he was smiling. Haley could speak, can move, and remember my name. When they said she might never do any of those things again, we brought Doctor Eric Champagne on her discharge day, and he hugged us both like family. For three months, our life felt like a miracle, with Haley getting stronger every week. She painted again, and we took walks and made love like newlyweds discovering each other. Doctor Eric called these his victory check ins, and we tell him every small triumph while he beamed with pride. But then the weekly appointments became twice weekly because he said her case was teaching him so much about the brain, Haley was too grateful to mind, and I was too relieved to question it. By month six, I noticed Doctor Eric's eyes stayed on Haley too long during examinations, like she was a painting he'd created. He started calling her my masterpiece instead of using her name, and his hands would linger on her skull where the scar was. When I mentioned it to Haley, she said I was being ungrateful, but I saw how she flinched when he touched her now. Then came the night calls asking about her dreams and demanding detailed descriptions of her headaches. I found forms for research studies with my signature that I'd never signed. And when I confronted him, he laughed and said I must have forgotten in the stress of her recovery. The monthly MRIs he insisted on made Haley claustrophobic, but he said skipping even one could mean missing something fatal. I started going to appointments with her after finding him in her office at lunch, checking her pupils because the afternoon light was optimal. My jaw would clench when he'd show other doctors videos of her walking without our permission. But speaking up felt like spitting on a miracle. The breaking point was when he told Haley she couldn't switch to a local neurologist for follow UPS because no one else could understand what he'd done inside her skull that night. I told her we needed to get away from him, but she was terrified he might be right. Everything exploded the night I woke to find our bedroom door open.

I was doing my midnight security rounds three weeks before Christmas when I heard a child crying behind the supply closet door that should have been locked and empty. My key card opened it to reveal my coworker Katie and her seven year old daughter surrounded by sleeping bags and a camping stove hidden behind toner cartridges. The little girl was doing homework by the light of a battery powered lantern while tears streaked down her face. Katie's terror when she saw my security uniform made her explain frantically about her ex husband who kept finding them everywhere, including the shelter where he'd shown up with a crowbar and the office was the only place with key card access where he couldn't reach them. The daughter whispered, please don't make us go back to the car. It's so cold and people knock on the windows at night. I stood there knowing the cameras had recorded me discovering them, and my boss reviewed footage weekly, which meant I had two choices that would both destroy someone's life. If I reported this, Katie would be fired and arrested for trespassing, with her daughter going to foster care. But if I didn't report it, I'd lose my security license permanently and face charges for harboring trespassers. My wife wife was on bed rest with a high risk pregnancy and losing my job meant losing our insurance right when she could deliver early. Needing N I C U. Care. That cost more than we'd make in five years. But reporting Katie meant sending them back to the streets where her ex was hunting them. And I kept staring at this kid doing multiplication tables in a supply closet like it was normal. How long do I have? Katie asked quietly, already starting to pack. Something about how defeated she looked made me say, stop moving and let me think. I sat on their sleep.

My stepmom controlled everything in our house. When dad travelled for work, which was often, she turned the place into her own private kingdom. She'd scream over dirty dishes, slam doors if a bed wasn't perfectly made, and punish small mistakes with bruises placed carefully where clothes could hide them. But in public, especially around family or dad's clients, she transformed into this picture perfect mom from some lifestyle blog. Always smiling, always telling stories about our bond while digging her nails into my arm beneath the table. Her favorite performance was the monthly brunch. That was her stage. She'd invite Dad's wealthiest clients, serve these fancy little quiches and croissants, talk about how proud she was of our wonderful blended family. I knew the script by heart. Smile, nod, speak when spoken to, and don't flinch, no matter how much it hurt. But one Sunday, during her biggest brunch yet, I decided to test something. I didn't make a scene. I didn't yell or cry. I just started making small mistakes. Every time I poured coffee, I let the China rattle just a bit. When I passed pastries, I gently bumped chairs, just enough to make the room feel slightly uncomfortable. Subtle things thing big, but they added up, and after about an hour, it worked. I was reaching across the table when I accidentally tapped one of the crystal glasses. It clinked louder than I intended, and That was all it took, she snapped. This is why your mother abandoned you. You're nothing but a clumsy, worthless mistake. The entire room froze. You could have heard a pin drop. One of the clients, a woman I hadn't paid much attention to, slowly sat down her mimosa. She reached into her purse, pulled out a business card, and slid it across the table toward me. Family court judge, it read. Two other guests stood up almost instantly. One muttered something about reconsidering the listing. The other just walked out without saying a word. A week later, the real estate board suspended her license pending a character investigation. Dad came home early from his trip. She packed up and left for her sister's house, and I moved into the master bedroom. Turns out she wasn't so scary once. People

I checked my daughter Kate's bank account and saw zeros where $300 should have been. Kate was 16 and worked 20 hours a week at a burger place, but somehow her entire paycheck had vanished. When Kate got home from her shift, I confronted her with a statement. I've been buying stuff for Zoe at school. She has a baby and nobody helps her, she explained. My first thought was that someone was running a sob story scam on my naive daughter. But Kate insisted that Zoe desperately needed help and the baby was suffer without it. The next morning, I gave Kate extra cash and told her to give it to Zoe. Thanks, Mom. Zoe's going to cry when I give her this. That afternoon, I got a call from the school. We need to discuss something serious with you about Kate. Immediately. I rushed to the school expecting the worst. Your daughter was seen in the parking lot giving another student prescription bottles and cash and what appeared to be a substance deal. We have zero tolerance for substances on school property, and we've already contacted the school resource officer. He turned his computer screen toward me to show the security footage of Kate hand Zoey two orange prescription bottles and money by her car. I felt sick realizing I've been giving Kate money that might have been funding prescription substance stealing. Mister Hayes said Kate claimed the prescriptions were antibiotics and diaper cream for a baby, but that sounded like a ridiculous lie to cover up selling pills. No teenager carries around multiple prescriptions for a baby they don't have, he said while shaking his head. That's when the school nurse walked in carrying a baby who was coughing so hard his tiny body shook with each breath. This is Zoe's son, she said quietly while patting his back. She brought him to my office this morning because he ran out of his breathing medicine and she didn't know what else to do. The principal went completely silent. The nurse explained that Zoe was 16 and had been trying to finish school while raising a six month old baby alone. Her parents had kicked her out and she'd been living in her car for the past month. The prescriptions Kate gave her were antibiotics for the baby's lung infection and prescription diaper cream for an infected diaper rash that had gotten so bad.

Like my daughter's existence is something to over come. My sister asks if I need money for school clothes. My father won't even look at me directly. They picked this specific restaurant because it's affordable, which means they think I'm broke. My mother actually says, don't worry, sweetie, we ordered water for the table. We know being a single mom is hard. The server keeps glancing at me nervously, but I shake my head at her. My brother slides a 20 across the table for gas money home like I'm still 17, borrowing the family car. My mother asks if I ever finished high school. When I say I graduated college, she goes, online degrees count too, honey. And my brother stands up all proud. I have an announcement. I just got hired as restaurant manager at this very chain. Everyone's clapping, and my mother says, See? Your brother didn't ruin his life. And look where he is now. My brother's bragging. I'm one of only four managers in the whole district. I report directly to regional. I'm making 60,000 a year. My father finally speaks to me. Maybe your brother can get you a job here. They're always hiring servers. My mother asks where the father of my daughter is, and I say, he left. Of course he did. What did you expect from having a baby so young? My sister shows photos from her Paris vacation last summer and tells me, maybe someday you can take your daughter somewhere nice. At one point, I managed to get out that I work in the restaurant industry. However, they keep assuming I mean waitressing. My mother tells another table very loudly, my daughter had so much potential. Got pregnant at 17. We tried to help, but she wouldn't listen. My daughter asks why grandma seems angry, and I tell her, Grandma's just confused. My brother's still going on about his promotion. The owner's supposed to stop by today.

They investigated him instead. My ex husband, Joshua, had been building his case against me ever since the judge ordered him to pay child support. Joshua decided he wanted full custody so he wouldn't have to pay me a single cent. He bought a hidden camera to film our eight year old daughter, Tracy during his weekends, trying to catch her saying something bad about me so that he could use it as evidence. He even paid his cousin to break into my apartment and plant recording devices. I work as a nurse at the hospital and sometimes my shifts run late. So Joshua started documenting every single minute I was late picking her up. He'd also take photos during his custody weekends, but only the ones that looked terrible. A photo of Tracy making herself a sandwich became proof of child abandonment. Small bruise from playing soccer became proof of physical abuse. Kimberly is going down hard, he told his brother while showing him the folder of evidence. When I'm done with her, she will never see Tracy again. When the doorbell rang on a Tuesday morning, I knew something was wrong immediately. The night before, Joshua had sent me a text that said, enjoy your last day with her. He told me I should be grateful if the judge let me see Tracy at Christmas. Now Missus Hendricks from Child Protective Services stood at my door with Official paperwork. Joshua had actually gone through with his threat to destroy my life. Your ex husband filed an emergency report claiming that your daughter is in immediate danger, Missus Hendrick said, stepping inside. He claims you leave Tracy alone for entire nights while you party with men. The accusations got worse with every page she turned. He says you have been starving her and she has lost 15 pounds in two months. Another page flip showed photos Joshua had edited to make Tracy look skinnier. He claims Tracy told him she's terrified, terrified of you and begs not to go home. My hands were shaking because I knew Tracy would never say that. He even got three people to sign statements saying they've seen you driving drunk to school pickup. Missus Hendricks walked through my house checking everything while I scrambled to defend myself. I showed her the full refrigerator and freezer packed with Tracy's favorite foods. I pulled out medical records from Tracy's checkup two weeks ago,

When my wife was pregnant with our twin boys, the doctors somehow missed her pulmonary hypertension, a heart condition that kills 30% of mothers in labour. We didn't even know she had it till she gave birth 12 weeks early and ended up in a coma. Even worse, when our boys came out, they were blue in the face and needed the N I C U. Immediately for any chance of survival. But apparently the hospital couldn't put them in the N I C U. They needed insurance authorization from our providers before saving their lives. I told her that would take days, and my boys were literally purple. But the woman just sighed. I'm sorry, but rules are rules. Without authorization, we're talking about a 4 hundred thousand dollar Bill you'd be personally liable for, she said, not even looking at my twins. I could hear the heart monitors going crazy. Please, I begged, dropping to my knees. Look at them. Look at them! They're dying. She glanced over for half a second. Sir, getting emotional won't change protocol. I suggest you call your insurance company. I fumbled with my phone, hands shaking so bad I could barely dial. The insurance company put me on hold while my babies were turning darker blue. Twenty minutes of that cheerful hold music while I watched my son Lucas's heart rate drop from 180 to 140 to 110. The administrator, Mrs. Miles, was at Her desk, eating a sandwich. I ran over. Phone still on hold. Please, just start the treatment. I'll pay cash. I'll sell my house. I'll sign anything. Sir, even if you had $400,000 cash right now, we can't accept it without going through insurance first. It's fraud prevention protocol. She took another bite of her sandwich. A young nurse finally broke. Missus miles, those babies have maybe an hour. Jennifer, you're already on probation. One more word and you're fired. The nurse shut up, but she was sobbing. Other parents in the waiting room were recording on their phones. Horrified. One dad stood up and said, lady, what is wrong with you? Missus miles called security. I need these disruptive individuals removed from the admin area. I ran back to my boys. Ethan wasn't moving anymore.

Again? I stared in shock. Again? I don't want to compete. Oh, sweetie, mom said, reaching across the table to pat my hand. The monthly room assignment builds character. Winners get the master suite. Losers get the basement. My younger brother, Marvin, pushed his food around his plate. My sister Bianca, wouldn't even look up. We've been doing this for three months since we moved to this house. The basement had exposed pipes, no heat, and spiders that dropped from the ceiling at night. Bianca won last month with her debate trophy. Dad continued, pulling out his notebook. So she keeps the room unless one of you beats her achievements this month. The chicken tasted like cardboard in my mouth. This is insane. Other families don't do this. Mom's smile tightened. Other families raise weak children. We're raising winners. That night, Bianca came to my basement corner, where I'd hung sheets for privacy. I'm sorry, she whispered. I didn't want to win, but sleeping down here made me sick last time. It's not your fault, I said, but the words felt hollow. Marvin had already stopped talking to both of us. Next morning, dad posted the point chart on the refrigerator. 10 points for A's, 20 for sports victories, 15 for volunteer hours, even five points for who said good morning first. I watched Marvin set his alarm for four A M. Just to beat us to the kitchen. By week two, Bianca started hiding my homework. I found it crumpled in the trash after getting a zero. Marvin put a dead spider in my backpack during lunch, making me scream in front of everyone. We stopped eating together, stopped helping each other with assignments. Three kids living in the same house, acting like enemies. Look, get that competitive spirit! Dad beamed. One morning, after Marvin and Bianca physically fought over who got to take out the trash for points. Mom took photos like it was something to be proud of. My grades started slipping from the stress. I couldn't sleep in the freezing basement, constantly checking for spiders. Bianca developed anxiety.

I forced a laugh, thinking it was a joke. What are you talking about, Scarlet? But my wife Sylvia's face had gone completely white. Scarlet pulled out her phone, scrolling through photos with determination. No, I'm serious, Reid. Look at this picture from your best friend's Facebook. The nose, the eyes, even that little dimple. She held up. A photo of my best friend Shane from college. You're imagining things. I. Scarlet wouldn't let it go, pulling up photo after photo on her phone, each comparison more damning than the last. Look, here's Bennett at three. And here's that photo of Shane from your wedding. Same exact cowlick, same ear shape, even the way they smile with just the left side going up first. My hands started shaking as memories began clicking into place like bullets into a chamber. That business trip Sylvia took five years and nine months ago, when Shane had coincidentally been at the same conference. The way Shane always brought Bennett the most expensive gifts. Showed up to every soccer game and every school play. I looked at my wife, hoping for denial and assurance that this wasn't real. Instead, I found her crying tears of guilt and clutching my arm while shaking her head. Bennett ran between us and looked at me with those green eyes. Shane's green eyes, not my brown ones. Daddy, why Is Mommy crying? He asked, and I realized with crushing clarity that I might not even have the right to that title. Sylvia, did you know about this whole time? The words came out flat, emotionless. Sylvia's hands were shaking. Read. I can explain. Explain what? I stood up so fast the chair crashed backward. You've been lying to me every single day for five years that my best friend is actually my son's father. It was just a mistake, Sylvia whispered, tears streaming. One mistake. One mistake! I laughed, cold and bitter. No, Sylvia. One mistake would have been sleeping with Shane. And then

I paused the T V. And laughed. No. Why did you? But Janelle didn't laugh back. I knew you were a selfish pig, she said, before walking out and locking her door from the inside. I honestly thought she was on her period or something. But when I walked into the kitchen, the entire room went silent. We can't believe you, Rhea announced. And he wouldn't even look at me. Can someone please tell me what's going on? I grabbed a chair, but Rhea pulled it away from me. You know exactly what you did. I was asleep like a normal person. You know I hate staying up late. It blinked back the tears because it felt like our years of friendship meant nothing anymore. That's when I saw I had 16 missed calls, all from my mom. She picked up on the first ring, but before I could say anything, she started sobbing. I thought I raised you better. You told me you promised you'd never do anything to hurt your future. Mom, what are you talking about? But she'd already hung up. She'd blocked me. Lindsay finally looked up, and her eyes were red, like she'd been crying. Samuel saw you. The whole basketball team saw you. My eyebrows furrowed. Samuel was my boyfriend of eight months. I went into our chat, and his contact photo disappeared. He blocked Me, too. Even your sister called me. Rhea said quietly. She wanted to know if you were okay, if you were on drugs or having some kind of breakdown. I told her, no, you're just a pick. Me? I left, making excuses about being late for class, not wanting them to see me cry. But when I got to campus, Doctor Rose was waiting outside the lecture hall. The dean wants to see you. Now. Her voice was cold, professional. Nothing like the professor who told me she believed in me. In the hallway, other students were pointing and whispering. When I checked my phone, I had dozens of texts from numbers I didn't recognize. Hey. Remember me from Tuesday night? You said I could crash whenever. Can I come by tonight? You promised.

But for whatever reason, a few years ago, there was one lady who just did not like me at all. Her name is Barbara Johnson, and for whatever reason, on every post I would make, she would comment something mean. And it started simple. It started like this. I hate to tell you this, but you're not very funny. You need to get some better jokes or find another job. I'm just being honest. And that's fine. You're allowed to think that. Sure. But then every time after that, for the next four months, anytime someone commented and said, Jaron, this is hilarious, I would respond and say, thank you so much, but let's get the opinion that matters at Barbara Johnson. She kept commenting things, saying stuff over and over, and finally I had enough. I was like, you know what? I'm gonna win this battle. I went back, I found the original first comment she made, and then I printed it on a T-shirt. I wore the shirt around town. I made this my profile picture. I thought those was the funniest thing in the world. And this kept her quiet for a while. She stopped responding, she stopped commenting on stuff. I was like, great, I won. And then several months later, someone made a post and they said, hey, Jaron's doing a comedy show not too far from here. He doesn't wanna come with us. Barbara had some words. Cause on their post she commented he may think he is funny, but he is not funny. He was at our church last fall and all he could talk about is how much weight he lost. It's true, I did lose a lot of weight. I don't think he's funny at all. Shirt number two came in the mail just a few days later. I thought this is the peak of my comedy. Barbara however, hated it with a passion. Cause when I posted the picture of the shirt she commented this will be the last communication I have with you. You think it's funny to walk around my name on your shirt and insult me? We talked about people like you at church today. To give you Grace and forgive you even though you don't know if you're hurt ones. So let's get down to the bottom. And it says I'm praying for you. I pray that you get down on your knees and ask for forgiveness. To which I responded gonna be hard to fit this one on a shirt. I haha.

But you guys went. Kept saying we were spreading misinformation. That's how I got my account banned the first time. And then a report comes out a couple weeks ago that in fact, the hundred million dollars that they said that they supposedly gave them, nobody in East Tennessee or Western North Carolina saw any of that funding. You remember that? Remember that? Then Doge drops a report yesterday backing up what we've been saying yet again, that FEMA just sent a hotel in New York City $59 million for illegal migrants. And then it comes out that the people who own the hotel in New York City is Pakistan. And then it comes out even more that New York City has a contract with Pakistan for $200 million for these illegal migrants.

Then she almost killed a kid. I'm what teachers call a helper. You know that kid in every class who knows where everything is, who remembers the schedule? That's me. My regular teacher had a note at the top of her sub plans that said, Rosalinda is your go to student for any questions. I'd helped substitutes dozens of times before. It was never a big deal. Then our most recent substitute teacher strutted in. The second the bell rang, I walked up to her desk like I always did. Hi, I'm Rosalinda. Our teacher probably mentioned in her notes that if you need help with anything, I can show you where stuff is or explain the schedule. She looked at me like I just offered to perform brain surgery. Excuse me. She said, I have been teaching for 23 years. Do not need a child telling me how to run a classroom. I felt my face get hot. Oh, I just meant go sit down, she snapped. I'm perfectly capable of managing a group of 11 year olds. The whole class went silent. Nobody had ever talked to me like that, especially not a teacher. My best friend whispered, what's her problem? I just shrugged. But inside I'm thinking, okay, if she doesn't want help, she won't get help. I wasn't trying to be petty or anything, but she made it very clear she had everything under control, right? So I decided I was just going to be a regular student that day, watch and see how perfectly capable she actually was. First period was going fine until the new kid raised his hand. His English was still pretty rough. He was asking something in Spanish, getting frustrated because he couldn't find the words. And the sub just kept saying, English, please. This is America. I know Spanish. And I could see he was asking to go to the bathroom. But I just sat there. Not my problem anymore, right? He eventually gave up and just sat there looking miserable. Then clarity tried to lean over to help him and the sub yelled, no talking. She looked at me, do you have something to say? I looked away. That's when I started noticing things start to really fall apart. She didn't know that one kid gets his medication from the office at 11, so he missed it and spent the rest of the day feeling sick. We have a buddy system for the special needs kids during transitions, but nobody told her about it. So when we switched classes for science, Jamie got left behind and had a meltdown in the hallway. Every time something went wrong, I could feel her getting more flustered, but she just kept acting like she had everything under control. Then came lunch and this is where everything went from annoying to actually dangerous. We always ate lunch in our classroom on Fridays. That much She knew, but she failed to notice. My regular teacher had this huge laminated poster on the wall listing every kid's allergies. It was impossible to miss. But she decided to hand out peanut m m's as a treat for good behavior. I watched her walk right past Harold's desk and my heart literally stopped. He's deathly allergic to peanuts. Like Epipen in the classroom, can't even be near them. Level of allergic. He was in the bathroom so he didn't see what she was giving out. I saw her pull out the m m's and my hand shot up. Wait, Harold is allergic to. Did I ask for your input? She snapped, not even looking at me. Put your hand down. I tried one more time, but he can't eat. One more word and you're going to the principal's office. I've had enough of your undermining. She walked right past his desk. Just.

You see when he collapsed on the floor, the Germans thought he was dead and buried him a few hours later. But as the legend goes, the poison was only meant to slow his heartbeat and fool the prison doctors. So the next day, Soviet soldiers dug up his body, injected the antidote and took him back to safety. This is a glove pistol, a special weapon developed by KGB spies. To fire it, they first open the chamber and load a single bullet. Once the chamber is put back in, they can wear it like a regular glove. But in a moment of danger, they can deliver a powerful jab which releases a spring loaded striker and fires a deadly bullet. Shoots a tiny metal pellet that lodges under the skin, leaving only a small red dot. Each of these pellets is loaded with a deadly poison made of ricin. And once inside the body, the poison gradually shuts down the vital organs, leading to death within a few days. This umbrella gun was used by secret services to eliminate targets without leaving a trace.

He's a first round pick. He gets 18, almost $19 million fully guaranteed on his rookie contract. But the reason he's not signing cause the Bengals tried to sneak in a little clause in the contract. And this clause that they try to sneak in there was saying that if he gets in any trouble, this is a very blanket term, they can void all future guarantees on his contract. So his agent is telling him, no, you're not gonna sign that. And he hasn't practiced at all with the team and he's actually been practicing with Texas a m. And Shamar here could really mess things up for the NFL cause 1, he could go back to college football. That would probably involve a lawsuit because the NCAA doesn't allow people who were drafted to go play back at college football again. It's possible but not likely. No. 2, he could ask.

So if you don't know who this man is, his name is Jerry Jones and he owns the Dallas Cowboys. And if you wanna know his net worth, just take the biggest number that you can think of, multiply that by 2 divided by four and then multiply it by 7 again. The point is Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to Cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of him. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string, they got Trey Lance. Now if you remember a couple seconds ago, I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush and Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt. And although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract, there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand.

First time offenders convicted of criminal felony copyright violation face up to five years in prison, fines, restitution and forfeiture. And we all know that there is one, maybe two men behind this. This motherfucker right here, Dana White, has been after these guys for years. Even back in 2020, this dude was throwing out threats at press conferences. A reporter asked him about piracy and he was like, yeah, we fucking got one. You turn that shit on this Saturday, brother, we got you.

The point is, Jerry's got a shit ton of money, right? The guy shows up to cowboys practices in his private helicopter. They created a damn AI generated hologram of it. But what he did today takes the cake. So on Jerry's roster, he's got three quarterbacks, right? First you got the main man, Dak Prescott, who unfortunately is out for the season with a hamstring injury. You then got QB two, who's Cooper Rush, who's been playing all year since Dak got hurt. And then third string they got Trey Lance. If you remember a couple seconds ago I said that the second string quarterback was Cooper Rush. And Cooper's been leading the team since Dak got hurt, and although he hasn't been the best, he's got him a couple wins. But today is the last week of the regular season in the NFL, which means a lot of contract incentives are on the line. And in Cooper's contract there was a clause that said if he plays 45% of the snaps, he'll get 250 grand. Now thankfully Cooper has gotten that 250 k as he sets At 52.3% of the snaps played this year. But there's another incentive that says if he plays 55% of the snaps, he'll get another 200.

My stepmother said, pay us $26,000 and we'll let you in. Your sister needs a vacation. I just nodded and said, understood. Then I walked away. The next morning, she found a letter at the door and started screaming so loud, the neighbors came outside. There's a certain kind of tired that doesn't come from lack of sleep. It sits in your bones, behind your eyes, in that hollow space where energy used to live. That's the kind of tired I was when I pulled into the driveway at 2:00am. I've been on shift for 18 hours straight, not just filling charts. I'd done chest compressions on a 16 year old until my arms burned. I pronounced two people dead. I brought one back. I had dried stains on my sleeves and hospital antiseptic buried so deep in my skin that showers didn't help anymore. All I wanted was to laps, maybe eat something, sleep for four hours before my next shift at 7:00am. So when my key didn't fit, my brain couldn't process it. I turned it again, jiggled it, stared at the lock like it might apologize. Then the door opened. My stepmother stood there in yoga pants and a wine stain tank top holding her phone like a weapon. Oh, she said, you're back early. Behind her, my stepsister was sprawled on the couch wearing my hoodie, scrolling TikTok. Her boyfriend who hadn't Worked since moving in, was eating chips. I bought the key. Doesn't work, I said. Right. We changed the locks. Rents gone up. You want back in? $26,000 in back rent plus utilities. Your sister needs a vacation and you're a doctor. You can afford it. She said it like she was doing me a favor. I stood there holding my duffle bag, shoes sticking to the welcome mat. Did dad approve this? She smirked. Your father's overseas. This is my house. When he's gone, I make the rules. I looked past her. My textbook, we're still stacked on the floor. My name was still on the utility bills I paid two weeks ago. But sure, her house understood, I said. I nodded once, turned around and walked back to my car. I didn't slam the door, didn't yell, just drove off into the night. I slept in the hospital call room that night on a plastic mattress with a scratchy blanket that smelled like bleach. And while I slept, they celebrated. My stepsister posted about it on TikTok. Some petty caption about freeloaders learning their place got 12,000 likes. They didn't know was that I've been waiting for this moment for three years. Before my dad deployed overseas, he called me into his office, told me he knew what kind of person Lisa was, said he'd seen how she treated me when he wasn't around. Then he handed me a folder. Inside was a deed transfer, signed, notarized, legal. He put the house in my name before he left, told me not to tell Lisa, told me to keep paying the mortgage like normal, let her think she was in control and wait. I'll show you who she really is eventually, he said. And when she does, you'll know what to do. I've been paying the mortgage for three years every month on time, which meant Lisa had been paying me rent this entire time. She just didn't know it. The next morning I drove back and knocked once. Then I left an envelope on the doormat. Then I parked down the street and waited. 15 minutes later, the door opened. Lisa appeared in fuzzy slippers holding a mug that said, I want mom. She bent down, picked up the envelope, opened it and screamed. Not a gasp, a full throated soul shaking.

Nope. This is not just a boy, but many are terrified. We are watching the final seconds of him and his life is being taken right now. People were terrified after Tiktoker nurse Hannah and her family were allegedly ending the lives of their own young ones in front of us, with many claiming the boy has been calling us for help, but it might now be too late. A haunting viral video shows what allegedly appeared like the boy was cowering after being handed a box at a supermarket, with many parental experts saying it was not a flinch, but seemingly a brace for impact. Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing. With many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all, they may to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flicked, with even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be, but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house, and many allege the situation might be much worse now.

In court. She recalled the day three years ago when her stepfather cruelly killed her four year old brother James Andrew and threw him in the trash can outside their house. Stepfather often locks them in the bedroom to prevent them from entering the kitchen to eat. She often hears James crying. Once the girl sneaked into the kitchen and found four year old James lying motionless under a blue blanket. He immediately sent a message to her mother for help, but did not receive any response. Later she saw her stepfather put James in a black garbage bag and she never saw him again since then. Her 10 year old and seven year old brothers also testified in court telling the story of their stepfather not only brutally abusing James, also forcing them to live in fear, eating only once every three days and often being beaten by him. He also used children's toys such as airplane models and Spider Man dolls to beat James until he could no longer move. Whenever she and her brothers hear James crying, they feel extremely helpless and hopeless. The girl also mentioned that once James was caught stealing food by his stepfather because he was too hungry. Stepfather used the toys they usually played with as tools of violence and ultimately beat James to death. All of this has caused immense mental trauma to her and Her brothers. How many years do you think stepfather should be sentenced to for these terrible behaviors?

The total amount was only counted after Jeffrey dropped these coins off. So from then on, he simply began stealing a bit here and there from every single parking meter he emptied, since there were just so many meters in his area. Before long, he was pocketing between 200 to 600 dollars in three quarters every week. Jeffrey probably thought he'd hit the Jackpot. There was no way for him to ever be caught.

You see, every time Jeffrey was depositing his stolen coins, he would not only use the bank branch right near his parking meters, he would also still even be wearing his parking uniform. But somehow these bank workers never ask questions. And it was only five years later that they finally became suspicious about his uniform and reported him to the police. By then, Jeffrey had already stolen more than $90,000. After he was arrested, he was forced to pay everything back and also spent 17 days in jail.

I slept in two years. When the police searched the residence of singer David Burke, they found bloodstains. Evidence suggests that David got Celeste Rivas pregnant before she was killed. During the search of David's residence, the authorities focused on finding bloodstains and investigating the possibility that Celeste was killed there. The police conducted a search at the home rented by David's agent and ultimately took away a computer and several items. It was reported that a figure resembling Celeste appeared in one of David's music videos. Another image showed Celeste in the backstage area with David's brother wearing her signature Hello Kitty Crocs. A Twitch live stream featuring both David and Celest was also exposed, in which David repeatedly asked the moderator to delete all clips and live stream replays. Photo also circulated online and TMZ said it had investigated the photo and found that the location in the photo was only a six minute walk from where Celeste lived before she went missing a year ago. All the evidence points to David Burke. May Celeste rest in peace.

You see, since Jeffrey did, I was the one responsible for emptying all these parking meters in the first place, there was no way his boss would know if a stash was a few dollars short. The total amount was only counted after Jeffrey dropped these coins off. So from then on, he simply began stealing a bit here and there from every single parking meter he emptied, since there were just so many meters in his area. Before long, he was pocketing between 200 to 600 dollars in three quarters every week. Jeffrey probably thought he'd hit the Jackpot. There was no way for him to ever be caught. As it turns out, he was actually right. There really wasn't a way. But little did he know it wouldn't even matter since he would soon accidentally turn himself in. You see, every time Jeffrey was depositing his stolen coins, he would not only use the bank branch right near his parking meters, he would also still even be wearing his parking uniform. But somehow these bank workers never ask questions. And it was only five years later that they finally became suspicious about his uniform and reported him to the police. By then, Jeffrey had already stolen more than $90,000. After he was arrested, he was forced to pay everything back and also spent 17 days in jail. Jeffrey later said this ruined his life since he lost his job and his wife also left him.

After receiving the alarm, the police rushed to the scene only to find that the mother had already taken control of the suspect. Phyllis Pena said that when she returned home she saw a malicious man peering into her 15 year old daughter's bedroom. The suspect rushed towards her upon seeing the situation and Phyllis chased after him. This process was captured by the police's dash cam. He's coming this way. And my daughter's like, mom, no, don't. And I'm like, no, there's no way I'm letting him get away. After she pushed the suspect to the ground, her daughter also ran over and helped hold him down until the police arrived. And she did a good job. She was willing to step in and put herself in harm's way and held him until officers could, could take him into custody. The suspect has been identified as 19 year old Zane Hawkins and has been charged with illegal drug possession and resisting arrest. What do you think about this?

That's what happened to one couple down in Cape May last Sunday. Michael ordered his usual appetizer. A dozen clams on half shell. I was down to the 12th one, and when I picked it up with a fork, it looked kind of heavy, but I didn't think nothing of it. And then when I started to eat it, um, I noticed something was in my mouth. I actually thought one of my tooth broke. It was actually a pearl. He's eaten dozens and dozens of clams, and we've never found anything like that. So it was pretty exciting. Not only did something spectacular and rare happen on their impromptu trip, the couple was also celebrating something special. It was actually, um, our anniversary of 34 years. Of coming here for the very first time. So that even makes it more special to, say, Weekend 87. Yeah. The popular restaurant is celebrating its Centennial year. Not a bad gift for the spresslers to walk away with. I have worked here for around 10 years now, and I've never heard of somebody finding one in one of our oysters or clamshells. A whopping 8.8 millimeters. It could go for thousands of dollars. But money is no factor in this equation. I would like to have it set into a nice piece of jewelry, maybe with a mermaid or something nautical.

She recalled the day three years ago when her stepfather cruelly killed her four year old brother James Andrew and threw him in the trash can outside their house. Stepfather often locks them in the bedroom to prevent them from entering the kitchen to eat. She often hears James crying. Once, the girl sneaked into the kitchen and found four year old James lying motionless under a blue blanket. He immediately sent a message to her mother for help, but did not receive any response. Later, she saw her stepfather put James in a black garbage bag and she never saw him again since then. Her ten year old and seven year old brothers also testified in court, telling the story of their stepfather not only brutally abusing James, also forcing them to live in fear, eating only once every three days and often being beaten by him. He also used children's toys such as airplane models and Spider Man dolls to beat James until he could no longer move. Whenever she and her brothers hear James crying, they feel extremely helpless and hopeless. The girl also mentioned that once James was caught stealing food by his stepfather because he was too hungry. Stepfather used the toys they usually played with as tools of violence and ultimately beat James to death. All of this has caused immense mental trauma to her and her brothers.

I started waking her up for stuff early on because she missed a dentist appointment once and was super stressed about it. Became our thing, I guess. I didn't really mind at first. Like, yeah, sometimes I'd rather sleep in, but that's what you do in a relationship, right? You help each other out. She had summer classes online this year, which meant exams at home. The night before her big exam, I was in the kitchen grabbing water around midnight when I heard her on the phone with her friends in the living room. She didn't know I was there. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but our apartment isn't that big. That's when I heard her say it. She was laughing and telling her friends how I'm basically her little bitch. Like, those exact words she said. I do whatever she tells me to, and she's got me trained. Her friends were eating it up, too, saying stuff like, good for you and make sure he Knows his place. She laughed and agreed. Then she said something that really got me. She goes, I'm not even worried about my exam tomorrow because my bitch will wake me up and probably have breakfast ready too. I just stood there holding my water bottle, feeling like an idiot. I didn't say anything. I went back to the bedroom and she came in a few minutes later, acting totally normal, kissing me goodnight like everything was fine. I barely slept. I kept replaying it in my head. What? Was I really that pathetic? Did she actually see me that way, or was she just trying to sound cool in front of her friends? Morning came and her alarm went off at 7. Normally I'd shake her shoulder until she woke up. Sometimes took a couple minutes. This time I just rolled over. Her alarm buzzed for like 15 minutes. She turned it off in her sleep like always. Then it went quiet. I could have woken her up. Part of me wanted to, but another part of me was just done. If I'm her little bitch, then she can wake herself up like an adult. I ended up falling back asleep. When I woke up again, it was almost 10. She was standing at the end of the bed literally screaming at me. Her exam started at 8 and ended at 9:30. She completely missed it. Called me every name in the book. Asshole, piece of shit, selfish, immature, She said I ruined everything and she might fail the whole class now because this exam was worth 30% of her grade. I finally told her I heard what she said last night. She went quiet for a second, then tried to play it off like it was just a joke and I was being too sensitive. She said her friends were just messing around and I should have known she didn't mean it. I asked her if she thought it was funny. She didn't answer. She just grabbed her stuff and left to go stay at her friend's place. It's been three days. She's texted me a few times saying I'm being dramatic and that I should apologize for letting her miss her exam. Her friends have been messaging me, too, calling me petty.

Every night, he injected a mysterious liquid into her ear. This liquid could make his wife temporarily lose her memory, turning her into his personal servant. While she was cleaning the floor, she found a wedding photo at home. In it, she saw Mike, but she didn't remember the marriage. The photo made her suspicious, so she decided to uncover the truth. She hid the photo and at night went to the church to search for clues. The patriarch recognized her immediately, calling her a benefactor, an important figure in the church. But she remembered nothing. She noticed newspapers on the wall, but couldn't recall anything. Then she followed the address in the paper and arrived at a company. The place felt unfamiliar, yet oddly familiar. An employee came out to hold an umbrella for her, meeting her into the office. Inside, she saw a photo on the desk. She was shocked to discover that the company president was actually the same person. Slowly, her memory returned. She realized she had been under her husband's control. She immediately went home to confront him. Her husband claimed she had a mental illness and begged her to continue taking her medication. After comforting him, she was confused, so she decided to follow him. She discovered an underground warehouse filled with tons of amnesia drugs. Her husband had planned it all, injecting her repeatedly at. At that moment, he reminded her she wasn't allowed to Go outside without permission. He had run out of money. So that day he woke her with drugs and she transferred her money to him. That was how he used her money to throw parties, making her his servant while parading two beautiful women in front of her. But this time, the wife wouldn't let him go. She took the injectable drug, tied her husband to the bed and gave him the same medicine he had made. After that, her husband became her servant.

Then a stranger sat down next to me and said, act like you're with me. I've had an attention vampire for a sister since the day she Learned to talk. Annika. If I want a spelling bee, she'd fake a seizure during my trophy presentation. If I got asked to prom, she'd announce her pregnancy scare at dinner that night. If I graduated with honors, she'd choose that exact moment to reveal she was dropping out to pursue acting. Signs were there by my seventh birthday. Almost predictably, when I blew out the candles, Annika screamed that she saw our dead hamster's ghost and wouldn't stop sobbing until everyone comforted her instead of singing to me. I didn't care, since I just wanted cake anyway. But by the time we hit our 20s, it got malicious. I got into nursing school after years of studying. Annika showed up to my acceptance dinner claiming she'd been secretly battling an eating disorder and needed immediate family support. Since when? I asked, rolling my eyes, you were literally posting food pics yesterday. Annika burst into tears. Wail, I'm crying for help, and you're attacking me, mom! Do you see how cruel she is? She ran to the bathroom in hysterics. After that disaster, mom pulled me aside. You need to stop competing with Annika for attention. She's sensitive and artistic. This jealousy you harbor is making her act out. Maybe if you included Her more, she wouldn't need to make these scenes. I had never competed for anything. A year later, Annika got engaged to her boyfriend, Damon. She planned the most extravagant wedding possible, sending daily updates to the family, group chat about her dress fittings and venue tours. But two weeks before the wedding, she sent me my seating assignment. Table 12, the singles table by the kitchen door. She'd separated me from our parents, cousins, even our grandmother. The message said, I figured you'd be more comfortable with people in similar life situation. Question since you're perpetually alone. With a stupid smile emoticon. The wedding day came, and I sat at my assigned reject table between our dad's weird co worker and someone's plus one who'd been ditched. During the reception, Annika made sure to highlight my singleness in her speech. I'm so blessed to have found Damon. Not everyone finds their person. My sister, for example, has been at so many weddings alone that venues should start charging her rent. The crowd laughed politely while I stared at my plate. She continued with more jokes about my terminal singleness and how she tried to set me up. But some people are meant to be alone. She even had the DJ dedicate all by myself to me, announcing it loudly so everyone would look. That's when the stranger appeared. Was tall, with dark hair and sharp features. During Annika's second costume change, he approached my table with a fresh drink. That was brutal to watch. I'm Kane. Want to give her something else to talk about? I looked at him confused. He leaned closer and explained. Pretend I'm with you. Trust me, I've seen her type before. She can't stand when someone else gets attention. I had nothing to lose.

My dad started gaming at 73. Not casual phone games, hardcore world of Warcraft rating 12 hour sessions, yelling at his built through a headset he bought with his Social Security check. It started after mom died. Dad was sitting alone in their house watching game shows and waiting to die himself. I bought him a basic computer so we could video chat. Within a month he discovered Twitch, then steam, then descended into what he called real gaming. His transformation was remarkable. This man who'd called the t V remote too complicated was suddenly building his own gaming piece, arguing about graphics cards on Reddit and explaining frame rates to confused Best Buy employees. You're too old for this, my brother kept saying. It's embarrassing. Too old for what? Dad would respond and having fun making friends using my brain. His guild didn't know his age. At first he went by tank grandpa and everyone assumed it was ironic. He was good, really good. Studied boss mechanics like he used to study tax code when he was an accountant, LED raids with military precision from his time in Korea. Then came the incident that made him famous. During a crucial raid, Dad's mic glitched and his video feed turned on. 23 raiders suddenly saw a 75 year old man in reading glasses and cardigan cat on his lap, absolutely destroying the hardest content in the game. Holy shit. Tank Grandpa Is an actual grandpa, someone typed in chat. Dad leaned into the camera. Watch your language, young man, and focus on the boss mechanics. Your DPS is embarrassing. The clip went viral. Literal grandfather schools millennials at their own game. Dad became a minor twitch celebrity. Kids less than a quarter his age subscribe to watch him play. But here's what those viral videos didn't show. Dad's arthritis was so bad he had to ice his hands between raids. His reflexes had slowed. So he compensated by memorizing every possible pattern and timing. He took naps between gaming sessions because it exhausted him in ways his old job never had. My brother was mortified. At family dinners, he begged dad to act his age. Dad would respond by explaining the lore of whatever game he was playing in excruciating detail until my brother left a table. Last year, dad had a mild stroke. The doctor said he recovered. Remark.

He crashed out the second we walked into the bar and my boyfriend saw his buddies playing darts at the back. He abandoned me at a tall table near the entrance. I was sipping on a drink I didn't really want when some drunk guy sat on the stool next to mine. Hey, gorgeous, why are you sitting here all alone? He slow third putting his hand on my thigh. I jerked away, looking desperately toward the dartboard where my boyfriend was laughing with his friends. But he hadn't noticed what was happening. Why don't you and me go somewhere quieter? I've got a really nice car. I scooted away and told him I wasn't interested. But he leaned even closer, playing hard to get. I like that. His fingers traced up my arm and I felt my stomach turn. Need another drink or are you good? Said a voice from behind the bar. I looked up to see the bartender watching me with concern in his eyes. I'm Daniel. He glanced at the drunk guy who was still sitting way too close. Sir, there's plenty of other seats available if you want to spread out a bit. The drunk guy muttered something about just having a conversation, but Daniel kept staring at him until he finally grabbed his beer and went away. I Felt my shoulders relax for the first time since we got here. Daniel grabbed a glass of ice water and set it in front of me without asking if that guy comes back over here, you just let me know. This complete anger had done more to make me feel safe in 5 minutes than my boyfriend had done all night. Thank you. My boyfriend's supposed to be here with me, but he's busy playing darts with his friends. Daniel looked toward the dartboard in the back corner where my boyfriend was cheering after hitting a bull's eye. Yeah, I've seen him here before. Actually, he paused like he was deciding if he should say more. Last weekend he was here until last call. I remember thinking his girlfriend must be super understanding because most people don't love being ditched for darts. All night I felt something twist in my chest. He told me he was homesick last weekend. Daniel stopped wiping and looked at me with something between pity and anger. Listen, it's not my place to get involved, but I've been doing this job long enough to know what it looks like when someone doesn't feel safe. He nodded toward where the drunk guy was now bothering someone else. A good boyfriend wouldn't let that happen to you. I thought about all the times my boyfriend told me I was overreacting when guys made me uncomfortable and how he said I should take it as a compliment when Men hit on me. My boyfriend still hadn't even glanced in my direction to see if I was okay or still sitting where he left me an hour ago. The drunk guy must have seen me sitting alone again because he started making his way back toward my end of the bar with this creepy smile on his face. Hey, beautiful, your friend leave you all alone again, he slurred, reaching for my arm. Daniel appeared between us so fast I didn't even see him move. Buddy, I already asked you once to give the lady some space. The drunk guy tried to push past him, but Daniel stood firm with his hand up. If you can't respect my other customers, you're going to have to leave. That's when my boyfriend finally looked up from his.

The breaking point came during an important work call when Lily burst into my office screaming that Tommy had walked past her bedroom door without asking permission first. and three clients heard the entire down through my unmuted microphone.

Only real emergencies were free, like if someone was actually hurt, breaking something valuable or doing something genuinely dangerous that required intervention. I spent an entire evening explaining the system carefully to both kids, creating specific examples of what counted as tattling versus legitimate concerns that needed my attention. Lily seemed to understand the rules perfectly and even nodded enthusiastically when I said this would help her think before complaining. Tommy just looked absolutely relieved that his sister might finally leave him alone. Battling stopped immediately and completely. For two absolutely blissful weeks, our house was perfectly quiet. No constant complaints echoing through every room, no sibling drama interrupting my work calls or peaceful evenings. I could actually focus On important tasks without being summoned every few minutes to referee microscopic disputes. Tommy seemed genuinely happier during this peaceful period, playing freely in common areas without his sister monitoring his every single move like a tiny surveillance officer. He started laughing more often, running around the house without constantly looking over his shoulder, and even began voluntarily leaving his room instead of hiding from Lily's watchful eyes. I bragged extensively to my mom, my sister and my co workers about my brilliant parenting breakthrough. My sister asked for detailed instructions to try with her own constantly bickering kids. My mom laughed and said I should seriously consider writing a parenting book about creative discipline techniques. I was feeling incredibly proud of solving our biggest household problems so elegantly. But after those perfect weeks ended, Tommy gradually started acting increasingly strange and withdrawn. He'd visibly flinch when I walked into rooms and kept asking completely random anxious questions, just like, are you mad at me about something or did I do something wrong today? When I asked what was specifically bothering him, he just mumble nothing, never mind, and quickly run to his room. At first, I assumed he was just adjusting to having less daily conflict with his sister. Kids can.

Everyone knew Nick was the reason people actually liked coming to school. Nick could just walk into any room and people would start smiling because they knew something funny was about to happen. Teachers would try so hard to be mad at him, but they'd end up laughing instead. He won class clown every single year and hosted all the school events. I remember when our whole grade had to retake standardized tests because of a computer glitch and everyone was super mad about it. Nick showed up wearing an inflatable Dinosaur costume under his regular clothes and slowly started inflating it during the test until the teacher noticed this giant T Rex taking a math test and completely lost it laughing. Nick knew exactly what would make people laugh without being mean about it. When this shy girl dropped her entire lunch tray in front of everyone, Nick immediately dropped his own tray and yelled twins to made everyone laugh with them instead of at her. He made this kid who always ate alone feel included by creating a whole bit about how sitting alone was actually the VIP section of the cafeteria. During junior year, when everyone was stressed about college stuff, Nick started a daily joke segment during morning announcements called Bad Joke Wednesday. Even though he did it every day of the week, the principal tried to shut it down, but the whole school complained so much they had To bring it back, Alan Show was supposed to be Nick's big night because everyone knew he'd been working on something epic for months. The auditorium was so packed that people were standing in the back just to watch watch. Nick grabbed the mic and started his bit about how our school Spirit Week themes were getting so weird that next year we probably have dressed like your parents biggest disappointment day, and then paused and said, wait, that's just every day for me. Everyone was losing it and filming everything when Nick suddenly just went completely quiet. He stood there holding the mic and staring at something in the crowd.

Portland, Oregon became my destination. Clean slate where nobody knew my story. Meanwhile, she discovered reality. Landlords don't accept I'm going to be a doctor payment. When the electricity shut off three days later, she finally understood that I hadn't been dead weight. I've been the foundation. Her texts started week one, calls began week two. 27. In one day, I deleted every message, unread every call, go to voicemail. By month three, she'd hired a private investigator. I landed a construction management job, bought a house with a yard, joined a hiking group, started dating a graphic designer who had her own career and actually seemed interested in my thoughts. After a year, I proposed. Three years after that parking lot, she tracked me down through medical database records, showed up at my work, my house, even got police called for trespassing. She cornered me at Home Depot on a Saturday afternoon. Please just give me five minutes. For what? To apologize, to ask for another chance. You had eight years of chances. You use them all up in a parking lot. I was stressed. I said things I didn't mean. I've regretted it every single day. Which part do you regret? Calling me? Dead weight. Discovering that dead weight was keeping your life afloat. She tried explaining how hard residency had been, but she realized she'd given up the best thing in Her life. So when you thought you'd be wealthy and successful, you threw me away. Now that reality hit and you're struggling, suddenly I'm the best thing that ever happened to you. I love you. I've all always loved you. I'm engaged. We're getting married in September. The words hit her like a physical blow. Two weeks later, she showed up at my workplace claiming a medical emergency. I handed her two things, a restraining order and a wedding invitation. I want you to understand that I'm not just moving on from you. I've already moved on completely. Six months later, I married my fiance. My ex wife wanted a fresh start with no dead weight. I gave her exactly that.

I signed them without argument and disappeared so completely that three years later, she was still searching. Eight years of working double shifts to pay her medical school tuition, eight years of frozen dinners, canceled vacations and being told once I graduate, everything will be different. The graduation ceremony was on a Thursday in may. I took the day off work, bought a new shirt. This was supposed to be our moment, our achievement, our future finally beginning. When they called her name, I stood up and clapped harder than anyone else. The ceremony ended around noon. I waited by the car while she posed with classmates. That diploma clutched like a golden ticket. When she finally walked over, I expected a hug. Instead, she handed me a vanilla envelope. Divorce papers, she said, like she was discussing the weather. I already signed my part. This wasn't a spur of the moment decision. This was planned. Look, I don't need you anymore. I have my degree, job offers, future. You were helpful during school, but that chapter is over. No dead weight. Eight years of marriage reduced to two words, helpful and dead weight. Her colleagues were gathering around us watching. I open the envelope. Everything already filled out. Assets divided, apartment claimed. Then I did something that surprised everyone. I pulled out a pen and signed every page right there in the Parking lot. I ended our marriage with the same casualness she'd started this conversation there. Congratulations on your graduation and your divorce. Her mouth drop popped open. She'd expected drama, begging anger. You're not going to fight this. Why would I fight for someone who just called me dead weight? I walked away from the car, leaving her standing there with her diploma in one hand and our signed divorce papers in the other. Three days later, I was gone from the state. The beauty of being married to someone who never paid attention to finances. She had no idea what I controlled. The apartment she thought she was getting. Lease in my name only paid for my personal account for two years. I closed our joint.

Weeks later, she bragged about it and mom overheard everything. I was 15 when my sister Becca destroyed my life. She was 14, the golden child who could set the kitchen on fire and dad would call it a learning experience. I forgot to mow the lawn once and I was heading nowhere past eleven PM, my door slammed open. Both parents stormed in. Dad's veins visible behind them. Becca fake cried. He stole it. I saw him take it from Dad's wallet. Dad grabbed my pillow, crumpled bills, maybe $300 fell out. I told you, Becca said, tears streaming. That's not mine. She planted it enough, dad barked. A liar and a thief. Mom didn't look at me. Becca stood behind them smirking. Dad tore up my room, tossing belongings into a trash bag. I'm scared to share a house with him, Becca sniffled out. Now they shoved the bag into my arms. Dad jerk the door open. Night air hit like ice. I was barefoot in sweatpants. Dad pushed me onto the porch. I grabbed my sneakers before he slammed the door. You don't come back until you apologize. I was 15, standing outside with nowhere to go. She'd won the first night. Lindsay let me stay. After three nights, her mom said she couldn't afford another mouth. I couch surfed for a week, then started sleeping behind the gas station near The dumpsters. $40 vanished on burgers. After that, I skipped meals at school. Kids pulled backpacks closer. A basketball player shoulder checked me. Watch your hands, thief. By week two, I was a ghost. One night behind the gas station, Becca appeared with a Pepsi. Didn't think you'd last this long. Why are you doing this? By being me. Every grade compared to you. Don't be like your brother now. I don't have to be perfect. I'm not giving that up. Her grin widened. What's sick is how easy it was. Everyone already thought you were the screw up. By week three, I'd hit bottom. Money gone, phone dead. Hadn't eaten in two days. Lindsay found me under a laundromat awning. She handed me $60, her allowance saved up. Becca bragged at a party. She told people she planted the money. She admitted it? Yeah. But nobody believed her that night.

So I printed out an eviction notice because that was my food and my house. I moved to this expensive city with my parents two years ago, fresh out of college with a software engineering degree and I landed a six figure remote job within weeks. My parents are both high school teachers. Combined they make about half what I do. We got a three bedroom condo together. My name went on the mortgage because my credit score was 780 and theirs was not. I cover 75% of everything, mortgage, utilities, internet, groceries, you name it. They contribute what they can and we made it work. The third bedroom became my home office. I'm remote full time so I need the space. A desk, dual monitors, the whole setup. We kept an air mattress in there for guests. And last month my older brother James calls his wife Mary is pregnant. Surprise, they're still living in our home state, barely making ends meet. My mom without asking me invites them to move in with us, says family helps family. They show up three days later with a U Haul. First thing James says when he walks in, which one's our room? He's looking at my bedroom, the master with the walk in closet and private, the bathroom. I laugh and say the office. There's an air Mattress and plenty of space. Once we move my desk, my mom immediately jumps in. Don't be selfish. They're having a baby. They need the bigger room. I look at my dad, he won't make eye contact. I remind everyone that I pay most of the bills here, that my name is on the mortgage, that I need my office for work. My mom calls me a selfish jerk. My brother says I've always had it easy and this is the least I can do. I tell them if they want my room, I'll move out completely and they can figure out how to cover my 75% on their own. That shuts everyone up. They take the office for a few days. It's tense, but man, manageable. I forget my laptop one morning and come home during lunch to grab it. I walk in and find Mary in my bedroom packing my clothes into boxes. My bathroom products are already in a trash bag. She's humming to herself like this is totally normal. What the hell are you doing? She jumps but recovers quickly. Your mom said I can start moving our stuff in. You're at work anyway, so I figured, get out now. Excuse me. I start grabbing my stuff from the boxes and throwing her things into the hallway. You have until 5.

So I turned his dream house into a living nightmare. The day Mr. Carlson moved in next door, he walked over to introduce himself while I was washing my car. Designer polo shirt, expensive watch. Handshake like he was closing a business deal. Beautiful neighborhood, he said, though I'll be making some upgrades. Going to turn this place into a proper showpiece. I just nodded. 12 years I'd lived there. Nothing fancy, just a modest house with a big yard where my golden retriever, Bailey, could run. She was already 9, more gray than gold, but still wagged her whole body when excited. Carlson spent the next month importing Italian marble, installing fountains, and constructing a towering fence around his property. Bailey barked sometimes, confused by the noise. Can't you control that mutt? He yelled one afternoon over the fence. Some of us are trying to create civilization here. I apologize, even though the jackhammers were louder than my dog ever could be. Then came the night everything changed. I was working late when I heard tires screeching, then a yelp that stopped too suddenly. By the time I ran outside, Carlson was standing over Bailey in the street. Your dog was in the road, he said, not looking up. Bailey was still breathing, but barely. Blood matted her fur. One leg twisted at an impossible angle. I need to get her to the vet, I said, my voice breaking. That's when I heard it. A short, dry laugh. I looked up and caught the smirk before he could hide it. It's just a dog, he said. I kept it on a leash. I carried Bailey to my car, my hands shaking. The vet did everything possible, but by morning she was gone. Massive internal bleeding. When I got home, Carlson was hosting a garden party. Champagne glasses clinked as people admired his new koi pond. He saw me walking up my driveway empty handed, eyes red. He turned away and laughed at someone's joke. Something inside me hardened. I didn't yell. I just started planning. I started small. One night I scattered bird seed all over his perfect lawn. Hundreds of birds showed up the next morning. Digging little holes everywhere, I poured liquid fertile

So I'm in this group project meeting for my marketing class. We're presenting to fake investors about our energy drink concept. Basically Red Bull, but for people who've given up on life. Very niche market. I spent three days creating this Powerpoint color coordinated slide, custom graphics, market research I definitely didn't steal from Wikipedia. Pure academic excellence disguised as last minute panic. We're presenting in front of the class. I'm clicking through my slide, explaining my research, when this girl, Madison, raises her hand. Can I just say something? She interrupts mid sentence. The professor nods. Madison stands up like she's about to deliver a civil rights speech. I think it's really problematic how he's dominating the presentation and not letting his female teammates contribute. I blink. I made the entire Powerpoint. They're literally reading off my slides. That's exactly the issue. She says, getting louder. You're mansplaining your own work instead of creating space for women's voices. Ma'am, how do I mansplain something I created? That's just called explaining. But she's not done. You clearly took over the project and sidelined your female group members. Classic patriarchal behavior. I look at my group members. Sarah, who showed up to one meeting and contributed the phrase sounds good. Jessica, who volunteered to handle social media and never mentioned it again. They had equal opportunity to contribute. I say carefully. Equal opportunity isn't equal outcome. Madison fires back like she's Quoting her gender studies textbook. Should have actively elevated their voices instead of steam rolling over them. The professor looks uncomfortable. The class is watching like this is better than reality TV. I literally asked for input every step of the way. I explained asking isn't enough. You should have insisted they take leadership roles. I stare at her. So you want me to force people to do work they don't want to do? I want you to recognize how your male privilege allows you to dominate academic spaces. Sarah, bless her soul, finally speaks up. Actually, he did all the work. I was supposed to help, but I had sororities.

I pulled out my phone and took a photo of the hair next to his head. Perfect color match. By now, other diners are watching the show. The woman's face was turning red. Are you accusing us of lying? Not at all, said. I'm just documenting everything for our manager. He'll want to review our security cameras to see exactly when this hair entered your food. Both of them went pale. Security cameras? Oh, yes. We have them throughout the dining room. Very clear HD footage. I'm sure they'll show exactly when this hair appeared in your dish. The boyfriend started backing down.

Marco, could you remove your cap as well? I took off my server cap, showing my equally bald head. Ma'am, Tony said politely, could you to explain how either of us managed to get an 8 inch brown hair into your food? The entire restaurant was watching.

The place has cloth napkins, multiple forks per person, and prices that make my student loan debt cry. Very. We charge $30 for pasta and energy. I sit down, look at the drink menu, and see they want $8 for a Coke, $8 for carbonated sugar water that cost them maybe 30 cents. So I do what any financially responsible human does. I order water. The waiter, let's call him Chad, because he looks like he exclusively drinks protein shakes and thinks his serving job is beneath his acting dreams, gives me this look. Just water? Yeah, water is fine. He pauses like I just asked him to solve calculus. Are you sure you don't want anything else to drink? Water is perfect. Thanks. Chad walks away, but I. I can tell he's not happy. He brings back my water like he's delivering bad news. Throughout the meal, he keeps asking. Still just water. Nothing else to drink? Maybe a soda? Bro, I said water. My answer hasn't changed in the last 10 minutes. But here's where it gets weird. I finish my meal, and when Chad brings the check, there's a five dollar service adjustment fee listed. What's this fee? Chad crosses his arm. That's for customers who don't order beverages. I blink. You're charging me for not buying drinks. You're taking up a table that could go to a customer who actually orders proper drinks. Proper drinks? Like there's an incorrect way to hydrate? I ordered food. I paid for food. I tipped on the food. But you didn't contribute to our beverage sales. Because I wanted water. Exactly. That's the problem. I stare at him. So you're penalizing me for being thirsty for free liquids? We're adjusting for lost revenue opportunity. Lost revenue opportunity for not buying overpriced Coca Cola. Sir, this is insane. You can't charge people for drinks they didn't order. Actually, we can. It's restaurant policy. He pulls out a laminated card like he's been waiting for this moment his entire shift. Restaurant policy. Customers who order only water will be subject to a beverage deficit fee to compensate for reduced profit.

She had her 11 day old baby, her 18 month old and her five year old in the back seat as well as her boyfriend in the passenger seat. Rachel ends up crashing into another vehicle and both burst into flames. Rachel was able to get out of the vehicle herself and good Samaritans who witnessed this crash at 1:00am came to try to help. At this point only her 11 day old baby and her five year old were in the backseat. Good Samaritans were able to get the boyfriend out but not the two children. They desperately tried but it was just too hot with all the flames and both of them passed away. Her 18 month old was ejected from the vehicle and taken to the hospital. The staff who took care of that baby described their condition and the injuries haunting. And just a few days later they passed away too. In the other vehicle was 70 year old Michael Sales. He was coming home from his second job, just trying to make it back home to his family. They couldn't get him out the vehicle and so he passed away too. Rachel and her boyfriend were the only survivors. As soon as she was released from the hospital, she was taken into custody. And just this week she's finally Been sentenced. She was given over 100 years. However, with the state laws, she can Parole out in 70 years, which means she's never getting out. What makes all of this more upsetting, if that's even possible, is just a few years prior she had a du. They gave her a slap on the wrist and she just went back to drinking 11 days after having a baby. Rachel also has at least three or four other children that were taken out of her custody. One of those children she shares with the boyfriend. Her and that boyfriend also share the three children who passed away. One of the children was taken away because they had leukemia and she was not seeking out the proper care for that child allegedly. And the fact they even left that 11 day old or the other kids in her custody is beyond me. I truly hope that Michael Sales family finally feels some justice and some peace as well as the children's family. Drinking and driving is 100% avoidable. If you can't afford an Uber, you can't afford to go out drinking, please stop drinking and driving. If not for other people, for yourself.

So back in 2015, Hard Rock Stadium underwent a 500 million dollar renovation so they could host events like the Super Bowl. However, they designed it in a way for the Miami Dolphins to win more football games. The worst problem with the old stadium was how hot it would get. The Dolphins have by far the warmest stadium in football. The average home game is about 75 degrees and early in the season it could be over 100. The old stadium had no shade, so to solve that they added an open air canopy to make it cooler. But what many people don't know is that it's not shady for everyone. The stadium was made so that the opposing team sideline would be directly in the sun during day games, and the Dolphins are perfectly in the shade. This makes a massive difference. Last season the Vikings sideline when they came to Miami was 30 degrees hotter than the Dolphins. There's was 120 degrees compared to the Dolphins 90. On top of all that, the Dolphins, unlike most teams, force the opposing team to wear darker uniforms while they wear white. They do that?

So from Super Bowl 1 in 1967 all the way until the 90s, the NFL never spent more than $1,000 a year getting the field ready for the big game. And the whole process would only take about a week. But now the Super Bowl is a billion dollar event and over 100 million people are going to watch it. So that's why the NFL now spends nearly two years preparing the grass for each Super Bowl. And what's interesting is the grass being used this year may be an advantage for the Forty Niners. So for Super Bowl 57 last year in Scottsdale, Arizona, the grass was grown at a local farm for 18 months. Then a few weeks before the game, it was brought to the stadium where it would sit outside in the sun during the day and then rolled into the stadium at night to avoid the cold. The cost last year was $800,000. But if you remember, the field was actually terrible. Players on both teams were slipping everywhere. It was a disaster. They had to replace their cleats.

Do you hear me? And you're wrong. They tried to give me a better life, and that's what I'm trying to do. What better life? We don't even own a car. We ain't got money. We ain't got nothing. Don't take it out of me cause you're a bus driver. The working man is a sucker. Father tried everything to pull me back from the edge, but I couldn't understand his ways. Blaming all problems on poverty. I discovered the club had been attacked. Friends happened to drive by. They were going for revenge. That's when sunny arrived with his men. He suspected I wanted to harm him. If you drop that car off, it didn't start. We lifted up the hood. There was something on the engine. Where did you go with my car? Sonny? I didn't do anything, I swear. Sonny, please don't fucking lie to me. I didn't do anything. I swear. I just went right to school and that was it. I swear to God. Why would I wanna hurt you? You've been like a father to me. Only then did I understand Father's words. Sunny trusted no one. My friends were waiting around the corner. My mind was filled with scenes of sunny questioning me. When I came to my senses, I discovered the car was loaded with two boxes of Molotov cocktails. I didn't want to be involved, but getting out now would make me look like a Coward to my friends. If I went along with them, my life would probably be ruined. How I wished someone would save me, right? Then suddenly appeared. See out of the car. Move. Fuck. For the last time. Stay away from this kid. I couldn't help asking the question. Deep in my heart, I can't believe it. After all this time, you don't even trust me. Listen, it's not that I don't trust you. No, I'm not gonna listen. You don't even believe me. That even was a Jane, don't you think it could have been in the car when I picked it up that me and Jane could have got killed? Never thought that, did you? Don't you trust anybody? No. For him, these were his rules for survival, but not for me. When we arrived at Sunny's Bar, someone told me a girl was looking for me. Turns out she knew everything my brother told me the truth. You did try to help him. Told you. I know, I know. But it took it out on you. I had saved her brother's life and her brother had lied to her. Then I suddenly remembered my friends driving off for revenge. My friends would hurt her brother. After she got in the car, you walk around the back of the car and you look through the rear window. If she doesn't reach over, lift up that button for you so you can get in. Yes. By the time we Arrived, it was too late. Burnt car fragments everywhere, along with my friend's bodies. If sunny hadn't shown up when he did, I would certainly be lying there, too. I said goodbye to the girl, wanting to hurry back to thanks on the in person. Sunny was attending a party. Suddenly, I noticed a hitman in the crowd slowly approaching him. The killer was the son of someone sunny had hurt years ago. Perhaps he knew this day would eventually come. At Sonny's funeral, everyone had left. I stayed behind alone to say farewell. I told him the girl had passed the test, thanked him for years of guidance and for saving my life. But he would never hear it.

Now we're doing drinks. And of course, I'm the chameleon again. My one word hint is sweet. Perfect. That takes out the alcohol. Water and milk.

No, I just, he, he took my hint. How could you forget? You were second idiot. And the only thing I have to go off is sweet. Be vague, but not too vague. Refreshing, solid. That worked. Okay. Now cross off all the drinks you wouldn't want on a warm, sunny day. Hot chocolate. Is that it, Eric? Hopefully your answer wasn't stolen. Nah. Energy. Energy. Is he talking? Caffeine, sugar, vitamins. Make up your mind. Final hint, please be good. Youth. Not bad. What here would I drink as a kid? God damn it, I would drink all of them. So who do you think I.

The proper response, I seen a video online. We just gonna put a foot on the brake, the clutch, put it in neutral, drop that e brake and we ready to go hey, and now we moving in first gear wait, wait, wait, hold up my guy we can't just go on the streets in first gear. Did you learn how to break yet? Don't seem that hard. Obviously it's the same as an automatic. Why? The car just died. Oh, so you're not ready for the streets. Well, that's okay cause your boy got you when it comes to breaking in an automatic car, all you gotta do is step on the brakes and you're fine and dandy, right? Well, it doesn't always work like that in a manual car, don't get me wrong. For the most part, you can still use your brakes normally, but when you come to a full stop, car will literally shut off if you don't implement this tip. So let's say we're cruising around in third gear and then we see a stop sign, but all I'm gonna decide to do is step on the brakes and come to a full stop oh no, the car shut off. So instead, while you're coming to a full stop, you're gonna clutch in, take that Thing out of gear. And since it isn't neutral, you can remove your foot from the clutch and just step.
