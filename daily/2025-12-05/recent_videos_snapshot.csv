As a seasoned killer, Lena knew those bodyguards posed no real threat. Took down two of them with lethal precision before stepping into the elevator. But the moment she entered, facial recognition cameras locked onto her. The elevator shot upward at high speed and abruptly halted on the 50th floor. Lena raised her gun, fully alert. Just as she expected, five armed guards were waiting outside. She moved toward the designated location and discovered several more hitmen who had been anticipating her arrival. At the center of the room lay the target of her mission, already executed by someone else. San Antonio, the mastermind behind the trap, stepped out to confront her. The entire operation had been orchestrated for one purpose to capture Lena. He offered her triple her usual fee if she agreed to join his organization. But Lena had never bowed to anyone. She detonated a fire extinguisher to create a smoke screen and sprinted away in the chaos. Enraged, Antonio immediately alerted the assassin stationed on the ground floor. As she reached the first level, Lena quickly eliminated several of them. But Antonio and his men were already closing in. Without hesitation, she slipped toward the parking area, jumped into a car, and sped away, vanishing before they could catch her.

I asked if anyone considered that I might be suffering, too. He called me a homophobe and hung up. My brother Daniel's the only one who gets it. He texted me at midnight. You're allowed to grieve. Your marriage dying. That's not bigotry. That's being human. Everyone else is performing. My sister in law posted on Facebook that I'm the exact reason LGBTQ people stay closeted, because of unsupportive spouses who make everything about themselves. 43 people liked it. My own mother commented, disappointed in how you're handling this. My phone's been exploding with articles. How to be an ally when your spouse comes out, processing divorce with Grace and support. Why? Your pain doesn't invalidate their truth. I'm not mad she's gay. I'm destroyed. That for 20 years, while I was falling asleep thinking about how lucky I was to have her, she was counting down the days until the kids turned 18 and she could finally leave. Tuesday afternoon, I come home early from work because I forgot my laptop. There's a silver Subaru in my driveway I don't recognize. I walk in, and Stephanie's introducing this woman named Savannah to our daughter via Facetime. Haley's crying happy tears, saying she's so glad mom finally found someone who makes her happy. Savannah's moving into our guest room. Not our house, the house I'm still paying the mortgage on. Just typically into one of our four bedrooms. Like I'm supposed to be fine. With this new roommate situation, I asked Stephanie if she was serious. She said Savannah doesn't have anywhere else to go right now, and it's not like we're using that room anyway. I'm staying at a La Quinta Inn near the airport. It smells like cigarettes and the Wi-Fi barely works. Haley texted me this morning asking when I'm coming home because this is ridiculous and embarrassing. She has friends asking why her dad moved out the second her mom came out. Connor sent me a Bill split request on Venmo for his textbooks with the note, since you're not contributing to the household anymore. I paid for his entire college tuition, all four years, up front. My wife moved her girlfriend into my house six days after ending our marriage at Olive Garden.

My girlfriend was so insane that she told everyone that we broke up because I cheated on her in her dream. She was a spoiled, rich girl who came from a terrible snobby family. They were the kind of people who would wipe their butts with hundred dollar bills if they ran out of toilet paper. If she and I ever got into an argument, she would run back to her daddy who would send her on a week long vacation to Cancun just so she could recover from our arguments. During one of these week long vacations to Cancun, she ended up getting pregnant from one of the six hotel staff she cheated on me with. But when she came back, instead of telling me, she told me that she was breaking up with me because she had a dream in Mexico that I would cheat on her. At this point, I was so over the relationship that I didn't care if it ended. After I moved out and moved back to my parents house, I got a call from an anonymous number. When I, I picked up the phone, it was my ex girlfriend's father. He called to say, you broke my baby girl's heart, now I'm going to break your head. I'd sleep with one eye open if I were you. I told him whatever and for him and his crazy family to leave me alone. Truthfully, I was scared. Of him. I knew he had enough money to hire whoever he wanted to do whatever he wanted. When I applied for a new job, I noticed someone was watching me at the office. They weren't just watching me, they were staring. When I left the building, I saw them following behind. I started to look around and that's when I saw a black van with two men inside it also watching me. I've seen enough movies to know what that meant. I didn't waste any time. I started running as fast as I could. I ended up running into a park where I found a police officer. I alerted him and told him that I was being followed by three men. I thought that he would help me, but instead he told me to put my hands behind my back and that I was being arrested. I demanded that he tell me why I was being arrested, but he told me to shut my broke ass up. The second he called me broke, I realized that this was all my ex's father I was doing. He paid the cop off to arrest me. At this point, I didn't even fight back. The cop put me in his cop car and just as I thought, he brought me to my ex girlfriend's estate. When he threw me out of the car, my girlfriend's father was waiting for me sipping tea like a James Bond villain. I asked him if he Was going to take my life away. And all he said was, we need to talk. I followed him inside and passed by my girlfriend who was getting her feet done. Her father sat me down and there was trembling in his voice. My babe.

Back in high school, this guy named Brandon made my life absolute hell. For two years straight, he would knock my books out of my hands, trip me in the hallway, and steal my lunch money while laughing with his buddies. The worst part was, we used to be actual friends in middle school before he decided being popular was more important. He started hanging with the jocks, and suddenly I was his favorite target. Every single day, he found new ways to embarrass me. Once he poured chocolate milk on my white shirt right before my presentation in English class. Another time, he took my gym clothes and threw them in the toilet. Teachers never did anything because his dad donated money to the school. I spent those two years just trying to survive and stay invisible. After graduation, I moved three hours away for college and never looked back at all. Contact with everyone from that town started fresh. Made real friends. Got my degree in accounting. Life was actually good for once. Then last month, I was visiting my parents for Thanksgiving weekend. My mom wanted to order pizza for dinner because she was too tired to cook. She pulled up this app and ordered from the local pizza place. When the doorbell rang 30 minutes later, I opened it without thinking. Standing there in a greasy pizza delivery uniform holding our pepperoni and cheese was Brandon His face went pale when he recognized me. I just stood there frozen. He looked rough. His hair was thinning, he had bags under his eyes, and that confident smirk he always wore was completely gone. Hey, man, he said quietly, handing me the pizza boxes, that'll be 23 50. I could tell he was praying I wouldn't say anything. His hands were actually shaking a little as he held out the card reader. For a second I almost felt bad, but then I remembered the chocolate milk, the toilet, gym clothes, the two years of constant humiliation. So I pulled out my wallet and handed him a hundred dollar Bill. Keep the change, I said, loudly enough for my mom to hear from the kitchen. His eye

I forwarded it to Catherine immediately. Catherine's response was swift. She filed a motion citing the judge's order about medical appointments requiring both parents consent. Within hours, my ex backtracked, claiming she'd made an error with the dates. Friday arrived with my usual pickup time. I sat in my car outside my ex's house watching the clock. Four PM came and went, no sign of the kids. I texted through the app, keeping everything documented. No response. At 4:30, I knocked on the door. My ex answered with a fake surprised expression. She claimed the kids were at a friend's birthday party and she'd forgotten to tell me. I asked for the address. She said she'd have to check and get back to me. I waited in my car documenting everything Catherine had warned me about these games. Stay calm, follow the process. Don't give them ammunition. An hour later, my ex emerged with the kids. They walked slowly, heads down, my daughter gripping her brother's hand. The drive to my house was silent. Jake stared out the window while my daughter clutched her backpack like a shield. At home, they went straight to their room without the usual excitement about weekend activities, made their favorite dinner, hoping to ease the tension. They picked at their food, exchanging worried glances when I asked about school. They gave one word answers. When I suggested a movie, they shook their heads. That night, I heard crying from their room. I found Jake curled up in his sister's bed, both of them trembling. I sat on the floor beside them, not wanting to crowd their space. Eventually, my daughter was.

My twin sister Emma always got the compliments. Same face, same hair, same everything. But somehow I was the backup copy. Teachers would say things like, oh, you're Emma's sister when they met me. Boys would ask me to introduce them to Emma. Even our own grandma would mix up our names, then correct herself and say, oh, wait, you're the other one. The worst part was picture day in 7th grade. Mom made us wear matching blue dresses because she thought it would be adorable. We stood next to each other for the twin photo. And when the photographer looked through his camera, he actually moved me behind Emma. This way the lighting hits better, he said. I knew what he meant. Emma never noticed how differently people treated us. He'd bounce into rooms and everyone would light up. I'd follow behind and get polite smiles. When we turned 16, Dad took us car shopping. The salesman spent the whole time talking to Emma about features and colors. He asked me if I was getting a car, too, like I was just there for the ride. That summer, everything changed when Emma left for cheerleading camp. For two weeks, I was just me. I started wearing my hair differently, bought clothes Emma would never pick. Actually talk to people instead of letting her do all the talking. When Marcus from my chemistry class asked Me to hang out. I couldn't believe he was talking to me and not waiting for Emma to show up. We went to the movies and got burgers after he kept staring at me and I thought maybe something was wrong with my makeup. Finally he said, you know, you're way more interesting than your sister. I nearly choked on my drink. Emma's pretty.

I live in a sketchy little neighborhood where everyone minds their business except for this one dude. Let's call him Rico. Rico is, well, he's like a local cryptid. No one knows where he lives, but he appears at 3:00am yelling about government conspiracies, anime girls and how he once fought a raccoon with his bare hands. Classic Rico. Anyway, last night I'm walking back from the corner store with a bag of Hot Cheetos and chocolate milk living my best trashy life when out of nowhere Rico lunges at me like a feral possum in heat. He's screaming something about me stealing his aura. At this point my fight or flight kicked in and apparently my brain chose black magic. See, I've been dabbling in some alternative arts lately. Long story short, I had a transformation Hex saved on my notes app. Don't ask why, just accept it. So mid lunch I screamed the words, clap my hands together and suddenly, poof, Rico is no longer Rico. Rico is now Rianna pink crop top, cat ears, thigh high socks, eyeliner sharper than my credit score, the full Femboy starter pack. He blinks, I blink. We both stand there for a solid five seconds like, did that just happen? Fast forward to today and uh, I may have listed him on Etsy under Handcrafted Chaos Beings. Someone from Portland bought him within 3 Minutes for 275 plus shipping. Now I'm sitting here sipping my chocolate milk, trying to process the fact that I may have invented a new side hustle. Before anyone asks, yes, Rico. Now Rihanna is thriving. The buyer sent me pics. He's got a made outfit. Now I don't know how to feel.

When did you realise you were living in a bubble and not like everyone else? I thought every kid had their birthdays planned by event coordinators. Until I was 13, every April, my parents would rent out country clubs or these fancy rooftop venues downtown. They'd hire magicians, ice cream trucks, face painters, and once even this guy who brought parrots that could talk. I'm talking like 60 kids from school showing up, tables covered in those fancy cloth things, waiters walking around with little appetizers on trays. But here's the weird part. None of the kids ever stayed long. Like they'd show up, eat some cake, watch the magic show for maybe an hour, then their parents would collect them and they'd leave. And nobody ever brought me actual presents, just these white envelopes that my mom would grab and stuff into her purse before I could even see what was inside. I didn't think it was strange back then. Figured that's just how birthdays worked. The envelopes probably had money or gift cards or something, right? And maybe other kids just had smaller parties because their parents weren't as organised as mine. Then in 7th grade, this kid, Jake, from my math class, invited me to his birthday party. I was actually pretty excited because Jake was cool and I wanted to be friends with him. My mom dropped me off at this public park and I was confused because there was no Ballet or anything, just regular parking spots. When I found Jake's party, my brain basically short circuited. There was one folding table with a plastic tablecloth, hot dogs cooking on this little portable grill and a cooler full of sodas. No servers, no fancy decorations, just balloons tied to the table legs. Get this, there was one soccer ball. That was it for entertainment. But all the kids were laughing their heads off. They were playing tag, kicking the soccer ball around and having these intense conversations about video games and t V shows. Everyone had wrapped presents, actual gifts and colourful paper with ribbons and stuff. Jake opened each one and got genuinely excited about things like Pokemon cards and a new skateboard. The party lasted four hours. Four hours. And nobody wanted to leave. Parents had to literally drag their kids away because it was.

Like, bro, real friends don't need to be in the same classroom or even the same postcode to stay tight. You could be across the city in a different uniform, learning completely different subjects, but somehow the bond never fades. Everyone else is like, oh, if you don't go to the same school, you'll drift apart. Nah, bro, not us. I could be sitting in math class stressed out over equations I'll never use in life, and you're across town doing science experiments, and we're still texting dumb memes like we saw each other five minutes ago. And when we do link up on the weekend, it's like we never left. No awkward vibes, no weird energy, just straight vibes. Bro, we might not be in the same school, but we've got the same mindset, same humor, same jokes, same energy. And the best part? When you meet their school friends and suddenly you feel famous, like, oh, you're that friend they always talk about. Yeah, that's me. I don't even go here, but I run this friendship. So if you've got a friend that's in another school but still feels closer than anyone in your class, appreciate that. That's real friendship. Forget proximity. It's about loyalty.

We're all very excited. Honey, put some ice in your mouth. You'll numb the taste buds. Are you ready to eat? Isn't anyone gonna eat? I'll do it. It's been a good 7 years. Remember me? Wow, this is good. You're not just trying to sucker us in, are you? Tongue out, up, down. She's clean. Wow, this is amazing. This time I just follow the recipe exactly instead of riffing on it like a jazz artist. So this is how dinner will always be. I can finally start to grow. It's on. So, Mike, are you ready for this? What's wrong? It's not good. Maybe the guy standing in the corner likes it. You're feeding it to the dog again? Why was tonight different? Maybe last night was a fluke. I'm gonna try again tomorrow and you'll see. I'm gonna go to the diet just to tell Linda about how great tomorrow night's dinner is gonna be. I finally got so bored following the recipes, I had to go back to my jazz cooking ways. We should tell Linda about it. Yeah. That's so funny. I didn't mean to do that. This is pretty more of a two person bench. I need to talk to you in the kitchen. What were you doing in there? I think I like Tyler. But Tyler's been chasing after you forever, and you were never interested. Now That he's with Emily and he's not trying so hard with me. I see how great he is. I don't want you hanging out with Nikki anymore. What? If you want me to be your girlfriend, she can't be your friend. What do you mean we can't hang out anymore? You're a good friend, but it makes Emily uncomfortable. You could break up with Emily. But then I won't have a girlfriend. Yes, you will. Wait, whoa! I choose you. For what? Nikki wants to be my girlfriend, so I've been wrestling with it, asking everyone for advice. I choose you! You're such a jerk! I choose you! I can't believe you were thinking about dumping me, but I choose you! I choose you! Excited? I'm so happy! Why is my rose bent? That's because Emily kept throwing it at me. Why did Emily have my rose? I gave it to Emily first. She made me realize I should go after my dream girl. You picked Emily 1st? Did you hear the part about you're my dream girl? You're such a jerk. Are you dating? Pizza and chocolate fondue? You are way smarter than anyone knows. Yep. I got me a warm bucket of chocolate. How'd you get this? I caught mom and dad snooping through my text with Nikki, so we've been sending each other fake texts about how sad I am so mom and dad will buy me stuff. He says he wishes he could be with Nikki. And L. Salvador. The only thing that will take his mind off it is if he gets a new BMX bike. I want a piece of this scam. This is my scam. Not if I tell mom and dad. He says he can't be happy unless his sister gets a Stacy's start off A lot doll. He never cares if anyone else is happy. He's playing us. We need to give him a taste of his own medicine. We've been reading our texts with Nikki. I am outraged. We're going to make it up to you. A bike? Yes. Ticket to El Salvador to see Nicki. Nicki? There's no way they'll actually let me get on the plane. There's no way you'll actually get on the plane. There's no way they're gonna let me get in that taxi. But the taxi's here. Get in the taxi. Yes, you are. Yes, I am. I'll go to El Salvador. I did not think you would go this far. I did not think you would go this far. Nicki.

Remember when we told her the family trip to Disney got canceled so we could go without her? My sister snorts. She believed us. For three years she thought Disney shut down. They're both cackling, and I'm sitting right here. My mom half smiles like, this is a horrible and not evidence my family convinced me a theme park ceased to exist. Oops! My sister giggles, finally glancing at me. Sorry, I forgot you were still here. She doesn't look sorry. Then my brother nudges my sister. Remember when she got grounded for a month for breaking Mom's face? My sister's eyes go wide. Oh my god. Wasn't that you, though? My brother shrugs. Yeah. Oops. They laugh harder. My mom looks at me and sighs. Don't look so upset. You were always the easy one. Never needed anything from us in the first place. She says it like a compliment. It lands like a grenade. I stopped asking for things years ago. I stopped expecting birthday calls or Christmas presents with my my name spelled right. I built walls so thick, I forgot people were supposed to be on the other side. My mom starts sobbing again about how dad won't let her say goodbye, and then suddenly the hospice nurse appears in the doorway. And says five words that make everyone freeze. He wants to see her. She's pointing at me. My brother says her out loud, like I'm a stranger who wandered in off the street. My sister's mouth drops open.

We scrambled to push all the desks to the back of the room. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely grip the metal legs. Jazlyn was crying.

The worst dancer gets shot. The Rasputin song started loading on YouTube. The animated figures appeared ready to dance. Wait, Eric said through tears. How do we know who scores lowest?

He was watching everyone with this sick smile. The gun was in his right hand because it was 3D printed and semi transparent. I could see inside it there was only one bullet. The idiot had printed a gun that could only hold one bullet, probably all he could figure out how to make. The song ended. Everyone was panting and crying. Pathetic, Kane said, especially you, missus Copeland. You didn't even try. He pointed the gun at her. She closed her eyes. The sound was louder than I expected.

Kane turned to point the gun at Cassie, but nothing happened when he pulled the trigger because there was only one bullet and he just used it. I tackled him from behind. His head hit the floor hard.

And somehow the truth was worse than anything I'd imagined. I'm not saying I was neglected. Neglect implies someone noticed you enough to actively decide not to care. I was more like furniture that occasionally needed feeding. The middle child sandwiched between my older brother, who could do no wrong, and my younger sister, who was the baby everyone adored. I exist in exactly zero family photos, not because I'm ugly. I mean, I am, but that's not the point. My dad would send me to grab something right before the camera clicked every single time. At my high school graduation, my parents left early because my sister had a dance recital. They saw her do a cartwheel and missed me get my diploma. So when my dad gets diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, the last thing anyone expected was for him to tell mom he wants to see me. Specific. I assume the morphine finally kicked in. Here's the thing, though. He won't let anyone into his room. Not my mom, not my brother, not my sister, nobody. They're all losing their minds about it, huddled in the living room crying and telling stories about him like he's already gone. My mom keeps dabbing her eyes saying he was such a wonderful father. And I'm sitting on the arm of the couch like a gargoyle wondering if I walked into the Wrong house. Then my family starts sharing memories, and somehow I become the punchline. My brother starts laughing about the time dad taught him to drive, and my sister jumps in with memory.

Nobody noticed I wasn't on the call. The wedding day arrived. I wore a 39 dollar suit I bought online. My mom made a comment about how I could have made more of an effort. My sister didn't look at me during photos. I stood in the back row, half cropped out of most of the shots. My dad gave a speech about how proud he was of his little girl. He didn't mention me once. My brother gave the best man toast. Nobody questioned it. He had the whole room laughing and crying within 5 minutes. When he finished, everyone stood and applauded. The MC grabbed the microphone and said any final words from family before we move to dinner? My dad shot me a look from across the table, a warning, don't you dare. I stood up, tapped my champagne glass with a fork until the room quieted down. 300 people staring at me, most of them wondering who I was, pulled out my phone and smiled. I just need one minute. Behind me, the projector flickered on. I'd paid the AV guy $500 to connect my laptop without telling anyone.

I honked, changed lanes, promised the universe I'd never complain about anything again if it just let me get there in time. My dress slid back and forth in the seat with each turn, a physical reminder of what I stood to lose. My sister spoke again, voice shaking. The coordinator said they're giving you 30 minutes before they shut the gate, 30 minutes. I was 27 minutes away. If I broke a few traffic laws, I'm going. I said, I'll make it. But then she added, there's something else. They said the cancellation request came from a woman claiming to be your wedding consultant to use your mother in law's number as the callback. This wasn't a misunderstanding. It wasn't bad paperwork. Someone tried to cancel my wedding. I screeched into the venue driveway with four minutes to spare. The coordinator, clipboard in hand, stood outside with two staff members and a security guard. And standing next to them was my mother in law. She rushed toward me. I told them, you're wearing the wrong dress. Let's go. We're changing the venue. My friend's club can fit us in. What did you do? I interrupted. Breathless, she blinked, offended. Excuse me.

I grabbed my bag, nearly tripped over the hem of the dress and sprinted out of the fitting room while the seamstress yelled after me to be careful. My mother in law followed, still ranting, but her voice blurred into background noise. I pushed call on my phone. My sister answered in a rush. The venue coordinator says there's a problem with the paperwork. They said if you don't get here in person to sign something, they can't host the wedding. They're threatening to shut it down. What paperwork? I gasped, already pushing through the shop doors and running toward my car. No idea, but they said it has to be you, not me, not mom, not your fiance. If the venue shut down now, hours before hundreds of guests arrive, our entire wedding would collapse. I threw the dress into the passenger seat, ignored the pins still attached and sped out of the parking lot. Adrenaline rushing through me. I stayed on the phone as I drove. Did they say why I never signed whatever it is? That's the crazy part. My sister said they claim someone told them you cancelled. Cancelled. I yelled, why would I? But then it hit me. My future mother in law had been pushing gently at first and then aggressively for us to move the wedding to her friend's country club.

There was rice stuck to my shirt. My back hurt from standing. I wanted to give up and just order take out. But then I remembered his voice last night, that sad whatever, like he'd accept that he'd never have it again. So I got up and I started batch No. 3. This time I set timers for everything, phone timer, oven timer, even the microwave timer as backup. I watched that pot like my life depended on it. I checked the rice every 90 seconds with a fork. I followed his mom's instructions exactly, measuring everything twice using actual measuring cups instead of eyeballing it. At 6:15, the rice was perfect. The chicken was tender and falling off the bone. The saffron had turned everything this we're just golden color. And the whole house smelled exactly like his childhood home, like his mom's kitchen on the wallie. I plated everything in our nicest serving dish and covered it with oil to keep it warm. Griffin just texted me, they're 20 minutes away. I'm standing in our kitchen right now surrounded by every dirty pot and pan we own. There's spices all over the counter. I have turmeric under my fingernails that won't come out. I used $40 worth of saffron in one dish and I'm still not sure I used enough. But the biryani looks incredible. It smells perfect. And in 20 minutes, my husband is going To walk through that door and smell his mom's cooking for the first time in over a year. I'm terrified this won't taste right. I'm terrified he'll take one bite and know it's wrong. But I'm also hoping that even if it's not perfect, he'll understand that I woke up before sunrise and drove four hours and spent seven hours cooking because I love him. The garage door just opened. He's home.

I loaded everything into the trunk and drove home, checking my phone every five minutes, terrified he'd wake up early and text me asking where I was. I got back at 10:30. I sat in the driveway for three minutes just reading. Then I checked through the bedroom door and he was still asleep. So I hauled six grocery bags into the kitchen as quietly as humanly possible. Every plastic bag sounded like a firecracker. I hid everything in the cabinet we never use, the one above the fridge. Then I called his best friend, Griffin, and begged him to take my husband out of the day. I need at least six hours, I said. Griffin asked why, and I just said, trust me, I'll explain later. He showed up at noon and they left to go to some car show two towns over. The second the door closed, I pulled out every pot we own. His mom stayed on Facetime with me for the first hour, walking me through the marination process. More yogurt, she kept saying. No more. You need at least two cups. Trust me. I've been making this for 35 years. I started cooking at one PM the recipe said medium heat, but our stove runs hot and I didn't adjust. The first batch burned because I had the heat too high and I panicked when I smelled it. I dumped the entire pot. In the sink and watch $60 worth of chicken and spices go down the drain. The second batch looked promising until I realized the rice was mushy, completely overcooked. I left it on for three minutes too long while I was answering his mom's call and the whole thing was ruined. Another $40 wasted. I sat on the kitchen floor at four PM and just stared at the ceiling for 10 minutes. I've been cooking for three hours straight and I had nothing to show for it except two pots of wasted food and turmeric stains on literal.

I overheard him last night on the phone with his friend saying, I just really miss my mom's biryani, you know? Then he went quiet and said, but we can't get the ingredients here, so whatever. That whatever broke something in me. We're both first gen Indian Americans, and since we got married last year, we've been living off chicken and rice because the nearest Indian grocery store is two hours away. I didn't realize how much he missed home until I heard his voice crack talking to his friend. So I made a plan. I set my alarm for 4:30 this morning while he was still asleep. I grabbed the grocery list. His mom texted me at midnight after I called her crying, and I just drove. The GPS said two hours and 12 minutes one way. The store opened at 7. I got there at six 45 and sat in the parking lot watching the sun come up, trying not to think about how I've never made biryani in my entire life. My hands were shaking when I grabbed my coffee. When the doors finally opened, I walked in and immediately felt lost. The store was huge and everything was labeled in three different languages. I called his mom from aisle 3, standing there with my list, and she walked me through finding every single ingredient. Basmati, rice, chat, saffron. $40 for a Container smaller than my thumb. He got it. Cardamom pods that I had to count out myself. The spices alone cost me $87. I stood at checkout watching the total climb. $120, $150, $180. The cashier asked if I was

She replied immediately, paragraphs how she could do both trips, how Chelsea was going through a really hard time with her parents divorce, how she needed this more than anything, how I was being selfish and unreasonable for not supporting her, how childhood friendships are different and I wouldn't understand because I'd never had one. That last part stung. I just left her on read. The next morning she texted again. Can we please talk about this like adults? I replied, there's nothing to talk about. You made your choice. I'm making mine. You're being so dramatic. It's just one trip. It's the trip we planned for 18 months. But sure, just one trip. She stopped responding after that.

I wasn't going to let my money sit in an account or a trip that wasn't happening. I bought a plane ticket to visit my cousin in Seattle instead. Same dates, same amount of money, but at least I'd be with someone who actually valued my time. Maya found out through our mutual friend Jenna. She called me eight times in a row. I declined. Every single one. Finally, she texted, withdrawing the money is so petty. You're punishing me for having other friends. I didn't respond. Two days later, Maya's texting the group chat.

He introduced us, said they've been working together for five years. Five years? And I'd never heard her name. Not once. On the drive home, I asked why he never mentioned her. He said, we rarely talk about work since I don't understand his field. That stuck with me, the way he said it. That night, I started paying attention. He was on his phone constantly, smiling at texts, typing quick responses. During dinner, during movies, even when we were in bed. A week later, I asked him directly, who are you texting so much? He didn't hesitate. He unlocked his phone and handed it to me. See for yourself. I scrolled through their messages. It was pages and pages of daily conversations, cute nicknames, inside jokes. Her complaining about her husband, asking intimate questions about our relationship, about me. Then I found the one that made my stomach drop. My husband's birthday is June 14. I threw him a party. Friends, family, everything. At nine forty seven PM that night, she texted, you must be Bored at your own party, or you wouldn't be texting me instead of being with her.

Summer ended, school started, and something weird happened. My kids actually started getting along. Maybe it was being back in routine. Maybe they just needed to mature a little. Maybe it was losing those tablets that did it. But they started sharing again, playing board games together after dinner, building Lego sets without fighting over pieces. September turned into October, then November. By the time Thanksgiving rolled around, my kids were like different people. They set the table together without being asked. My son helped my daughter with her spelling homework. I caught them laughing at some inside joke in the hallway one morning and it hit me that I hadn't heard them laugh together in months before the ipads got taken. Then December came and reality set in. Money was tight this year, like really tight. My hours got cut at work. Car needed new brakes. The water heater broke and had to be replaced. Every time I thought about Christmas, my stomach hurt. I sat down one.

I left it on for three minutes too long while I was answering his mom's call and the whole thing was ruined. Another $40 wasted. I sat on the kitchen floor at four PM and just stared at the ceiling for 10 minutes. I've been cooking for three hours straight and I had nothing to show for it except two pots of wasted food and turmeric stains on literally every dish towel we own. My hands smelled like garam masala. There was rice stuck to my shirt. My back hurt from standing. I wanted to give up and just order take out. But then I remembered his voice last night, that sad whatever, like he'd accepted he'd never have it again. So I got up and I started batch No. 3. This time I set timers for everything, phone timer, oven timer, even the microwave timer as backup. I watched that pot like my life depended on it. I checked the rice every 90 seconds with a fork. I followed his mom's instructions exactly, measuring everything twice using actual measuring cups instead of eyeballing it. At 6:15, the rice was perfect. The chicken was tender and falling off the bone. The saffron had turned everything this or just golden color. And the whole house smelled exactly like his childhood home, like his mom's kitchen on the wallie. I plated everything in our nicest serving dish and covered it with oil to keep it warm. Griffin just texted me. They're 20 minutes away. I'm standing in our kitchen right now surrounded by every dirty pot and pan we own. There's spices all over the counter. I have turmeric under my fingernails that won't come out. I used $40 worth of saffron in one dish and I'm still not sure I used enough. But the biryani looks incredible. It smells perfect. And in 20 minutes, my husband is going to walk through that door and smell his mom's cooking for the first time in over a year. I'm terrified this won't taste right. I'm terrified he'll take one bite and know it's wrong. But I'm also hoping that even if it's not perfect, he'll understand that I woke up before sunrise and drove four hours and spent seven hours cooking because I love him. The garage door just opened. He's home.

The gifts I could actually afford would fit in a shoebox, maybe two. I wanted to cry. My kids have been so good. They'd earned something special this year, but I just didn't have it. Then I remembered the closet, the boxes, the ipads. I dug them out that night, dusted off the cardboard box they've been sitting in, opened up each iPad box and checked that everything was still there. Chargers, cable screen, still perfect. They looked brand new. I wrapped them the next day while the kids were at school. Use the nicest wrapping paper we had, the shiny red kind with little gold stars, a big bows out of curling ribbon, put their names on fancy gift tags. On Christmas morning, there were only four presents under the tree, two for each kid. One was a pair of pajamas for each of them. The other was the wrapped iPad boxes. My daughter opened hers first. She ripped through the paper and then just stopped, stared at the box. She looked up at me with this confused expression. Wait, she said, is this my iPad? I nodded, but you said you sold them. My son said he was holding his box now, not even opening it yet. I told them the truth. I said I couldn't do it. I put them away instead and I told them The reason they were getting them back is because they showed me they earned them all those months of being good to each other, helping around the house, no fighting. That's what got them back. My daughter tackled me in a hug so hard I almost fell off the couch. My son just sat there for a second then said, so we were basically on a six month test.

I overheard him last night on the phone with his friend saying, I just really miss my mom's biryani, you know, then he went quiet and said, but we can't get the ingredients here. So whatever, that, whatever broke something in me. We're both first gen Indian Americans and since we got married last year, we've been living off chicken and rice because the nearest Indian grocery store is two hours away. I didn't realize how much he missed home until I heard his voice crack talking to his friend. So I made a plan. I set my alarm for 4:30 this morning while he was still asleep. I grabbed the grocery list. His mom texted me at midnight after I called her crying and I just drove. The GPS said two hours and 12 minutes one way. The store opened at 7. I got there at six, 45 and sat in the parking lot watching the sun come up, trying not to think about how I've never made biryani in my entire life. My hands were shaking when I grabbed my coffee. When the doors finally opened, I walked in and immediately felt lost. Just store was huge and everything was labeled in three different languages. I called his mom from aisle three, standing there with my list and she walked me through finding every single ingredient. Dasmati, rice, saffron, $40 for a container. Smaller than my thumb. He got it. Cardamom pods that I had to count out myself. The spices alone cost me 80.

By midnight, most people had left and there were only like four of us still hanging out in our living room. I was walking past the couch carrying a glass of red wine when I tripped over the edge of our carpet, like a full stumble and the wine went flying right onto Mary's jeans. I immediately started apologizing. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Let me get you some paper towels. I'll pay for the dry cleaning. I'm so sorry. Mary just stared at her jeans. Then she looked up at me. You did that on purpose? I was like, what? No, I literally tripped. You saw me trip? She stood up and her face was getting red. You're a witch. You've always been a witch. This is part of some ritual, isn't it? I thought she was joking at first, so I kind of nervous laughed bad Move. Don't laugh at me, she said. I know what you're doing. You're trying to ruin my life.

I couldn't stop laughing. So my wife, Mina, she's the kind of woman who turns heads wherever she goes, always glowing, always put together like she's walking out of a magazine, even if she's just running to grab milk. She loves fashion. She loves herself and she owns it. My sister, Betty, the complete opposite. She's the women belong in the kitchen type. Think floral apron, husband's dinner on the table by 6. I die for anyone who doesn't fit her idea of a lady. We don't talk much, and honestly, that's by design. Every time we do, she finds a way to throw shade at Mina. Like if Mina wears a sundress, Betty will go, well, at least she's dressed like a woman today. But if Mina wears something fitted or modern, it's, wow, that's a little revealing for family, don't you think? Mina just laughs. She's got that kind of laugh that makes you think she's unbothered, the kind that kills with Grace. But me, I'm counting to 10 in my head every time. Anyway, Eddie got pregnant and when she invited us to her formal dinner to celebrate, I thought maybe, just maybe, we could be civil. Mina wore this dark green tailored suit, sleek and powerful. It wasn't revealing, wasn't flashy, just elegant. She looked like money, like power, like everything Betty could never be. We get to the door, Betty opens it and her face drops like She just saw a ghost. She forces a smile and says, are you really wearing that? Mina? Cool as ever goes. Yes, you said formal, right? Inside, it's obvious Betty's been rehearsing her judgment all week. She's whispering behind her wine glass, smirking to my aunts, giving me those fake smiles that mean I'm about to talk shit. Every time Mina walks by, Betty's eyes roll like clockwork. At one point, she cracks this joke loud enough for everyone to hear. Guess, Mina, where's the pants in your marriage, huh? Poor you, stuck wearing all the pink frilly dresses. Everyone laughs awkwardly. Mina squeezes my hand under the table and whispers, don't, not tonight. I nod. I try to breathe. I try to focus on anything else, the candles, the baby photos, the sound of my jaw clenching. And Betty stands up, glass in hand, like to make a toast, she says. She starts soft, thanking everyone, talking about motherhood, family, all that sentimental crap. Then her tone shifts. Her smile fades. Her voice gets that sharp, sugary edge. She looks straight at Mina and says, it's hard raising a daughter in a world where women want to act and dress like men. She pauses, eyes locked on my wife like a sniper sight. The devil often hides in those closest to us. If you can spot him, don't let him into your home. The table goes dead silent. You could hear a pin drop. Everyone's eyes flick between them. Mina's calm face and Betty's smug little grin. Mina doesn't say a word. She just pushes her chair back, hands up, and walks out. No scene, no words, just this quiet dignity that somehow felt louder than Betty's entire speech. And me, I follow her. I don't even look back. Later that night, my phone blows up. My.

I froze mid scoop. What are you talking about? She didn't even look up from her phone. Your dad and I are getting divorced. We're selling the house. You have until Friday to decide who you want to live with. I was 17. They've been fighting for months, but I didn't think it was this bad. That night, I tried talking to my dad. He was in the garage packing boxes. Dad, what's going on? He finally stopped and looked at me. Your mom and I agreed. You're old enough to choose. No pressure. But there was pressure. My mom kept making comments about how Dad's new apartment was smaller. My dad mentioned Mom's boyfriend was moving in next month. Wait, boyfriend? Yeah, dad said, not meeting my eyes. Marcus. They met at her office. I felt sick. How long does it matter? He went back to packing. Next day, I confronted my mom. She was in her bedroom sorting through old photos and I noticed she was only keeping the ones without my dad in them. Marcus and I have been together for 4 months, she admitted. But your father knew we were already separated emotionally. Four months. The house went up for sale six months ago. Her face changed. Your father told you that? That's when I found the real estate listing on her laptop. She listed The house eight months ago, before the fights even started. I went back to my dad that night. When did you actually find out about Marcus? He was silent for a long time. Then he pulled out his phone and showed me a text. Red. My mom had been planning to leave for over a year. The messages went back to when I was 16. But it got worse. There was a message from my mom to Marcus that said, just need to wait until the life insurance policy matures in November. Then we can be together. My blood went cold. Dad, what life insurance policy? His face went pale. I took one out three years ago. Your mom's the beneficiary. It matures next week. Friday, I whispered. The same day they wanted me to choose. The same day they were finalizing everything. That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about how eager my mom had been for me to choose. How she kept.

Not just any reveal, either. This girl had 400,000 followers, and the video already had 2 million views. There was Kalani, my boyfriend of three years, kissing her in front of the Eiffel Tower with the caption, finally showing you guys my man. Together six months. My hands went numb. Kalani was supposed to be in Phoenix for a medical conference. I checked his Instagram. He posted a photo of a conference room 12 hours ago. But the meta data on her TikTok showed it was filmed yesterday in Paris. I screenshotted everything before my brain could talk me out of it. Then I went to her profile. Hundreds of videos of them together. Date nights, cooking videos, morning routines. The cooking videos were filmed in an apartment I didn't recognize. But I saw Kalani's watch on the counter, the one I'd bought him for his birthday. My stomach churned as I kept scrolling. Three months ago, she posted about meeting his parents. Same weekend he told me he was visiting his sick college roommate. There was a photo of her with his mom and dad at their anniversary dinner. The dinner I wasn't invited to because it was family only. I called him immediately. He answered on the second ring, casual as ever. Hey, Babe. Conference is pretty boring. Missing you. My voice came out steady somehow. How's Phoenix? Hot and full of old doctors. Can't Wait to come home tomorrow. I pulled up her TikTok of them at a French cafe. Posted an hour ago. That's funny, because Phoenix looks a lot like Paris on TikTok. Silence. Then what are you talking about? Adele Moreau. Ring a bell? Your girlfriend with 400 K followers who's been posting videos of you two for six months. He hung up. I called back. Straight to voicemail. I was typing a text when my phone rang. Unknown number with a French country code. I answered. You're the other woman. Her accent was slight but noticeable. Adele. Excuse me? Kalani told me about you months ago. His ex, who could. Didn't let go. He said you were stalking him. That's why he had to be careful about posting our relationship. The audacity of this man. I'm not his ex. We live together. We have a lease together. I just helped him pay for his mom's surgery. She laughed, bitter and sharp. His mom's surgery? His mother hasn't been sick a day in her life. I had dinner with her last night. She keeps asking when we're getting married. My head spun. Send me proof. Within minutes, my phone flooded with photos. Then with his parents, who I've been told didn't approve of me.

I stared at that text until 2 a m. Yesterday morning. My phone buzzed at 7:15. Him. Breakfast before school. Just us. When I got to the diner, rain wasn't there. Just him, sitting in our usual booth, looking weird, nervous. He was playing with the sugar packets, stacking them, unstacking them. Can I ask you something weird? He said without looking up. I nodded, suddenly very aware of my own heartbeat. Do you ever feel like you're supposed to want something, but you just don't? My mouth went dry. I asked what he meant.

By week 2, he stopped sleeping in our bed, started camping out on the couch, saying he needed space to think. Our daughter asked why daddy was sleeping in the living room. I told her he was having trouble with his back. When I asked him what he was thinking about, he couldn't believe I didn't even care enough to look at his phone, that my calm reaction proved I didn't love him. I trusted you. I said, why is that a problem? Because it means you wouldn't care if I actually did cheat. He snapped back, I just stared at him. That's not how trust works. Benjamin, Week 3, I found him crying in the garage at 2:00am. He said watching me stay calm proved I didn't love him anymore, that if I really cared, I would have been devastated, would have checked his phone, would have confronted this Jade person. I asked him if he wanted me to take a breakdown to make him feel better. He didn't answer. His mom called last week. Apparently he told her I had zero emotional reaction when he tested our marriage. She said maybe I was depressed and I needed professional help. I told her maybe her son shouldn't play stupid games if he can't handle the results. She hung up on me. Now he's refusing couples therapy, says there's no point if I'm this cold and unfeeling, that he needs a wife who actually shows emotions. I reminded him I show plenty of emotions. I cried watching our son's school play last month. I laughed at his jokes just last week. I get excited about things but not about losing me. He said, I'm not losing you. I said you're still here. You're just mad. I didn't panic. Yesterday morning, our 5 year old asked why daddy doesn't kiss mommy goodbye anymore. I didn't know what to say.

Sometimes I zoom in on the love you part like a complete psycho. It started in September. We were at his house playing video games and he just casually said, love you, man. When I left, I thought about it the entire drive home. My hands were shaking on the steering wheel. After that, the text start every single night. Even when he was on vacation with his family. Even when I knew he was at parties. 11:47 p m. Like clockwork. I tried dating girls to prove I was normal. Went out with Samantha from my English class twice. She was nice, pretty, into me. When she tried to kiss me in her car, I panicked and said I had to go because my mom was calling. My mom was literally asleep. Last Tuesday. We were studying for finals in his basement. He was lying on the couch reading his history notes out loud, and I was on the floor pretending to take notes, but really just watching him. The way he bites his lip when he's concentrating. The way he runs his hand through his hair when he's frustrated. Then he just passed out. Head tilted back, mouth slightly open, notes scattered across his Chest. I should have woken him up. Instead, I sat there frozen. As he shifted, his head landed on my shoulder. I didn't move for two hours. My entire left side went numb. My leg fell asleep so bad I had pins and needles. But I just sat there watching

He tried arguing, saying they could work it out, saying his parents didn't mean it like that. He hung up on him. Next day, his parents started calling me.

I'm sitting there confused because my daughter's been planning her career since she was in high school. She's got a whole thing mapped out. Told me about it 100 times.

Met them maybe three times for dinner and every single time they'd say weird stuff to my wife, like, why are you working? Shouldn't you be home with the kids? That's what mothers do. We'd just brush it off because whatever, they're old school. Then they got engaged, small party, nothing crazy. My daughter was glowing, talking about the wedding, showing everyone the ring.

I told her she had two choices, sleep in the tent tonight or lose her phone until Christmas break was over. She picked the tent. She kept trying to negotiate. Can I at least come in to use the bathroom? Yes. Can I get water? Yes. Can I come in if it rains? I told her the tent was waterproof and she'd be fine. I slept in the room right next to the back door so I could hear if anything went wrong, set three alarms to check on her throughout the night. Around 11, I heard her unzip the tent and run inside to pee. She was shivering, even though it wasn't that cold yet. Around 2 in the morning, I checked through the window and saw her curled up in the sleeping bag. 5:30, the bird started going crazy and I heard her groan. When I opened the back door at 7, she was already awake. Her hair was a mess and her eyes were red. Mom, can I please come inside now? Her voice cracked. I told her to come in and she practically ran. To the bathroom. When she came to the kitchen, I made her hot chocolate. She wrapped both hands around the mug and stared at it. It was horrible, she said quietly. The mat was so cold, even with all those blankets. The birds woke me up like five times and I kept hearing noises and didn't know what they were. I sat down across from her. Would you want to do that every single night? She shook her head and started crying for real this time, not fake tears, real ones.

Jessica told a homeless man he was lazy and that camping in December was basically a vacation. I'm a single mom who clawed my way up from nothing after my husband died when I was pregnant with my youngest. I worked three jobs while getting my degree. I know what it's like to wonder if you'll make rent. So when my older daughter Jasmine, showed me that video of Jessica yelling at a homeless guy, I lost it. The video was on Jessica's phone. Some guy outside the grocery store asked her for change, and she went off, stop asking me for money. You'd earn it yourself if you weren't so lazy and spending what you got on substances. Man said something about how cold it was getting at night, and Jessica actually laughed. Yeah, people camp for fun, even in December. You can't complain. You're living someone's holiday. I made her find that man. The next day, she had to apologize and use £20 from her birthday money to help pay for a hotel room for one night. She rolled her eyes through the whole apology. The man was nice about it, but I could tell Jessica didn't mean any of it. Then I signed her up to volunteer at the food bank starting next week. But I wasn't done. You said camping in December is fun, right? Like a holiday? I asked her when we got home. She got quiet. Real fast. I went to the garage and dragged out our old tent.

Completely locked up. Couldn't breathe. He slid his phone across the table. It was open to our text thread, but not just the messages folder. A screenshots folder. All 34 of my screenshots were there. Every single. Good night, bro. Love you. I'd saved. I noticed you screenshotting them, he said quietly, around message 6. So I started screenshotting yours, too. He scrolled down. There were dozens more screenshots of random texts I'd sent him. Good morning texts, memes I'd shared, a photo I sent him of a sunset. All saved, all dated. I have 127, he said. I counted last night. My hands were shaking so bad I had to put them under the table. So. He said, I'm either about to make the best decision of my life or completely destroy destroy our friendship. But I really need to know if you feel the same way I do. I couldn't form words. I just nodded. He smiled. Actually smiled this huge, relieved smile I'd never seen before. Prom's next month, he said. Wanna go with me? Like, actually with me? I'm still trying to process the fact that He's been screenshotting my texts for six months. We're going to prom together, and he just texted me good night 10 minutes early tonight. It said, good night, I love you. No, bro. This time.

After that, I bought one of those cheap $30 spy cameras off Amazon and hit it on my bookshelf. I've been saving for 14 months to buy my girlfriend an engagement ring. Every extra shift, every bit of overtime, went into that fund. Ford Alley. $200 for a white gold band with a center diamond and smaller stones on the sides. It was perfect. I kept it hidden in a small box tucked under the bottom drawer of my dresser, wrapped in an old T-shirt. Nobody knew it was there except me. Last Tuesday, I came home from work around six five PM. Something felt off in my room, but I couldn't place it. Wednesday morning I went to check on the ring before work. Just wanted to look at it, you know? The box was sitting on top of the drawer instead of under it. I opened it empty. My hands were shaking. I immediately check a camera footage. There he was. Three forty seven PM on Tuesday, while everyone else was out. He walked straight into my room, pulled open my dresser, moved things around until he found the box. He opened it, stared at the ring for a solid ten seconds, then put it in his pocket and left. The whole thing took less than two minutes. I showed my brother the video. He went pale. Called his wife in, called his son in. The kids stood there like nothing was wrong. My brother asked Him where the ring was. The kid shrugged and said, I left it by the TV in the guest room. Same exact use he used when he stole my 300 dollar watch last year. We found that watch two weeks later. Stuffed in his backpack behind the lining. They tore the guest room apart. Nothing. Checked his backpack, his clothes, under the bed in the closet.

So I kicked them out, and now he can use his talents on the streets instead. The kid's 9 years old and has been stealing since he was 5. It started small candy bars from gas stations, toys from other kids at daycare. My brother would always brush it off. He's just a kid. He doesn't understand property yet. By the time he was 7, target security had caught him twice. Both times they let him go because he's a minor. My brother actually laughed about it once at a family dinner like it was some cute quirk. I didn't think it was funny then, and I definitely don't now. Last year, his school called my brother in because the kid had stolen three different phones from other students. Backpacks not borrowed. Stole and hid them in his locker and denied everything until they check the cameras. My brother paid the family's back and promised to get him help. Never happened. No therapy, no consequences, nothing. A month ago, my brother showed up at my door with his wife and the kid. He'd lost his job at the warehouse, and they were three weeks from eviction. He begged me to let them stay while he got back on his feet. He's doing Uber Eats now while applying to play. This is trying to save enough for A deposit on a new apartment. I said no at first, specifically because of his son. But my mom got involved, called me heartless and said, he's your brother. So I caved. Told my brother straight up, your kid touches my stuff, you're all gone. He promised it wouldn't be an issue. Two weeks in, I caught the kid in my bedroom going through my closet. I told my brother to control his damn kid, or I'd handle it myself. My brother got defensive, said I was being paranoid that his son was just

Said I was trying to isolate her from her friends. Said I'd never understood her relationship with Jen. Then she grabbed a pillow and locked herself in our bedroom. I slept in the guest room that night, stared at the ceiling until 3:00am the next morning. I checked our phone Bill online. Jen had called Naomi 47 times in the past three weeks. Naomi called her back 52. Two times. They were talking for hours, sometimes past midnight. I felt sick. Yesterday, Naomi's mom called me. She was crying. She said Naomi told her we're having problems and she doesn't understand why. Her mom said Naomi seems like a completely different person lately. She won't even come to Sunday dinners anymore. I told her everything about Jen's visits, the overheard conversation, the sudden personality shift, the separation talk. Her mom went quiet for a long moment. Then she said something that made my blood run cold. Jen got divorced two years ago. Messy one. I wondered if she was jealous that Naomi's marriage was working. That's when it clicked. Jen doesn't want Naomi to be happy. She wants Naomi to be miserable. Like her. Misery loves company. Confronted Naomi last night, told her what her mom said. She defended Jen again. She's been through a lot. She's just looking out for me. She's poisoning you against me. I said you're being paranoid. I'm still sleeping in the guest room. It's been five days now. Naomi won't go to Couples therapy because, and I quote, Jen says therapy is just for people who've already given up on each other. This morning, Naomi left for work without saying goodbye. I found a text on her phone she left on the counter from Jen. It said, you deserve better. You know what you need to do. I realized I'm not married to Naomi anymore. I'm married to her. And Jen and I never agreed to that. I called a divorce lawyer this afternoon.

Then he started laughing this nervous, high pitched thing, and said it was just a prank. Showed me the text he'd set up with his buddy Marco using a fake contact name.

My first husband's affair actually destroyed me. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn't function for months. I know what real betrayal tastes like. It doesn't come with a gacha reveal and nervous laughter. It comes in silence and lies and deleted texts and late night work meetings that don't exist. When I saw that text from Jade and felt nothing, it wasn't because I don't care about Benjamin. It's because somewhere deep down, I knew. Real cheaters don't leave their own face up on the counter like 8. They don't shower with the bathroom door open. They don't watch you from the hallway waiting for a reaction. He wanted me to fall apart. He wanted tears and accusations and begging. He wanted proof that I'd die without him. Instead, he got a woman who's already survived worse than anything he could do to me. A woman who knows. Knows the difference between a real crisis and theater. And now he absolutely cannot let it go. He keeps saying our marriage feels different now, that he can't look at me the same way, that something between us is broken. I finally told him the truth last night while he was packing a bag to stay at his brother's place. You're right. It is different now. Because I know you were willing to hurt me just to see if I'd break. And when I didn't, when I just trusted you instead, you couldn't handle it. You Can't forgive me for not falling apart. He's been at his brother's for two days now. Our kids keep asking when daddy's coming home. I keep saying soon, but honestly, I don't know anymore.

The next morning, I checked our phone Bill online. Jen had called Naomi 47 times in the past three weeks. Naomi called her back 52 times. They were talking for hours, sometimes past midnight. I felt sick. Yesterday, Naomi's mom called me. She was crying. She said Naomi told Her we're having problems, and she doesn't understand why. Her mom said, Naomi seems like a complete, completely different person lately. She won't even come to Sunday dinners anymore. I told her everything about Jen's visits, the overheard conversation, the sudden personality shift, the separation talk. Her mom went quiet for a long moment. Then she said something that made my blood run cold. Jen got divorced two years ago. Messy one. I wondered if she was jealous that Naomi's marriage was working. That's when it clicked. And doesn't want Naomi to be happy. She wants Naomi to be miserable like her. Misery loves company. I confronted Naomi last night, told her what her mom said. She defended Jen again. She's been through a lot. She's just looking out for me. She's poisoning you against me. I said, you're being paranoid. I'm still sleeping in the guest room. It's been five days now. Naomi won't go to couples therapy because, as, and I quote, Jen says, therapy is just for people who've already given up on each other. This morning, Naomi left for work without saying goodbye. I found a text on her phone she left on the counter. From Jen. It said, you deserve better. You know what you need to do. I realized I'm not married to Naomi anymore. I'm married to her. And Jen and I never agreed to that. I called a divorce lawyer this afternoon.

My wife, Naomi, and her best friend Jen have been inseparable since college, 20 years of friendship. I've always dealt with it because Naomi's happy. But three months ago, something shifted. Naomi started saying things that didn't sound like her. Maybe we should wait on kids until we're more financially stable. We have $85,000 saved. I think you work too much. I work 9 to 5. My parents mentioned you're not very ambitious. Her parents love me. Every single new opinion came within 24 hours of Jen visiting our house. I noticed Jen started coming over three times a week instead of her usual once a month. She'd stay for hours and every time she left, Naomi would bring up something new to criticize about our life together. Two weeks ago, Naomi suddenly wanted to move to a bigger house. We bought our place two years ago. When I asked why, she said Jen's house has four bedrooms and a pool. We don't even have kids yet. Last Tuesday, I came home early from a canceled meeting. I heard voices in the kitchen. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop, but I heard my name. Jen's voice carried through the hallway. You know he's never going to make partner at that firm, right? My husband made partner at 32. Yours is 35 and still an associate. Naomi laughed awkwardly. He's doing fine. We're comfortable. Jen wasn't done. Comfortable isn't The same as successful. I'm just saying if you want the life you actually deserve, maybe this isn't it. Look at my cousin Josie. She divorced her husband last year and now she's engaged to a surgeon. She's so much happier.

By the end of the day, I understood why no one else would. Every school has its own set of unwritten rules. One of these at Goldbrook Middle School was about a 7th grader named Wesley. He sat alone at lunch every single day. Same table in the same corner, same untouched food. Students avoided him. Teachers avoided him. Even the other weird kids wouldn't sit near him. It was my first year teaching, so I didn't understand why everyone avoided him. Like the play egg. Sure, the kid rocked a bowl cut and had dirt under his fingernails, but there were kids still Naruto running in hallways making friends. When I asked around about Wesley, people turned away from me like I just coughed and we were back in 2020. Nobody told me anything about him. They just shook their heads like they were royal monarchs looking down on a peasant. So one day I took it upon myself to grab my tray and walk over to Wesley. Mind if I join you? He didn't look up. You shouldn't be here. He said it like shufu when taowung returned. But I sat down anyway. I'm Mr Davis. I teach eighth grade English. Nothing. He just stared at his sandwich like it had personally wronged him. I tried again. What's your favorite subject, dude? Doesn't matter. I kept trying. Okay, what do you do for fun? Nothing, bro. What do you mean? Nothing. How can one do nothing either way? A group of kids walked past our table. One of them muttered freak, loud enough for Wesley to hear. He didn't react like he was used to it, but I kept trying. I asked about movies, video games, music, yet I got nothing but one word answers in silence. Then Mr Crane walked into the cafeteria. Wesley's whole body went rigid. Mr Crane?

At the hospital, doctors and nurses rushed in and out every time his vitals crashed while I sat in the waiting room giving my statement to the officials and attending doctor.

But what he showed me was something no one could have ever expected. There wasn't internal bleeding, no swelling, not even a broken bone, just a few fractures and abrasions and a massive aggressive tumor wrapped around his kidney that had absolutely nothing to do with getting Hit by a car.

Little girls deserve to feel pretty. You're her father, not her mother. Some things you just can't do. I couldn't even respond. I just got in the car and drove home with my hands shaking on the wheel while Nova asked me what was wrong. And I lied and said nothing. That night, I watched Nova sleep and made a decision. I was done failing her. I'd find a salon and pay someone to do her hair every week, whatever it cost. I'd pick up extra shifts to cover it. She deserved better than my clumsy hands and lopsided parts and twist that fell apart by Wednesday. On Sunday, I was about to tell her that we weren't going to do our ritual anymore, that I'd found a better solution for her when she walked into the living room and told me to sit down because she had something for me. She handed me an envelope with my name written on it and her careful handwriting. And my stomach dropped because I was sure she was about to ask me for the same thing. I figured she'd finally worked up the courage to tell me she wanted a real salon instead of me. I opened it and found a printed confirmation from a salon across town called Natural Beauty. It was a registration for an eight week class on braiding and protective styles, covering technique and products and different styles for different occasions. The total cost was $400 and it was marked paid and full. I looked at my nine year old daughter sitting there with her hands folded in her lap and I didn't understand. I asked if she wanted to take the class herself, if she was tired of me doing her hair.

I ring up Susie's regular meal under the school plan. Then we swap identical brown bags real quick. Hers goes home with enough food to feed three kids for dinner. She brings back the empty containers every morning because she insists on keeping them clean for me. The first time I watch that girl actually eat her whole lunch, I cry right there by the milk cooler. She's never looked happier. Then one morning, the principal catches me on the way into work. There's a meeting I need you to attend. Five minutes. I can feel my pulse pounding in my throat. I walk toward the conference room and see the principal standing there with his arms crossed. The staff is already seated. My union rep is in the corner. This is it. I'm getting publicly fired. I step inside and brace myself. Then a bunch of people jump up yelling. Surprise. I'm standing there frozen, completely confused. The principal clears his throat and says another parent complained about the lunch bags. I feel sick. Then he says he pulled Susie aside to ask her directly and she told him everything. My chest tightens. That poor little girl. The principal looks at me and apologizes in front of everyone. I was wrong about you. The school is setting up a donation fund and connecting the family with real resources. Suzie graduated last spring. Then this little boy came through my line and asks me real soft if we have anything that might expire soon. I look at him and smile. Yeah, buddy, I think I got something for you.

My daughter Nova lost her mom when she was 3. And nobody warns you when you're a white guy raising a black daughter by yourself that the hair is going to be the thing that breaks you. I had no idea what I was doing those first few years and my wife wasn't there to teach me. I bought products that dried Nova's hair out until it was brittle, brushed it dry and watched chunks break off in my hands. Sent her to preschool with styles that fell apart by snack time. YouTube became my own teacher, but those women made it look so easy and my results never matched. Every Sunday night became our ritual where I'd sit her on the living room floor and attempt to get her hair ready for the school week. She's 9 now and I've gotten better. But better isn't good enough. I can do puffs that stay and I'm working on two strand twists, but they unravel by Wednesday and she comes home with her hair looking rough. The other moms at pickup used to give me sad little smiles, kind that said they could see how hard I was trying and how short I was falling. But lately the smiles have stopped. Now I catch them whispering to each other when they see Nova climb out of the car, their eyes going straight to her hair. Last month, One of them walked right up to me while Nova was getting in the car and said she had a niece who did hair and could give me a good price. I started to thank her for the recommendation when she leaned in closer. It's just not fair to her, she said.

Mom beside him, holding his hand. Sixty years of marriage, still looking at him like he hung the moon. Grayson walked to the front of the crowd, laptop in hand. I grabbed my sister's arm. Should we stop him? Too late. The screen lit up. Music started playing. Pop's face appeared. The No. 80 beside it. Then it started counting backwards. 77. Everyone watched in silence. The numbers kept falling. 21 all the way down to ten. Then the slideshow began. A black and white photo appeared. Little pops at 10 years old, standing next to his sister. Both of them gap toothed and grinning. The A I. Made the photo move. Suddenly, pops and his sister were chasing each other, laughing, pushing, being kids. Pops let out a sound I've never heard before. Half laugh, half sob. That's me and Rosie. Rosie died 15 years ago. Now she was alive on the screen, playing with her brother. At 18, pops was graduating high school, cap and gown, holding his diploma up to the camera. The photo Came alive. Made him wave it in the air, pump his fist, grin like the whole world was ahead of him. At 22, their wedding day, pops and mom, black and white. First dance. The AI made them sway together. Her head on his chest, his hand on her back. Young and in love, mom squeezed pops, his hand so tight, her knuckles went white. That's us, she whispered. That's really us. She was tearing up. At 25, he was shipping off to war. Standing at a bus station, duffel bag over his shoulder. Mom crying as she held him. The photo moved. Showed him kissing her forehead, wiping her tears, walking away, looking back.

I looked up from my plate. What settlement money? Uncle Frank's smile faded instantly. From the car accident five years ago when that delivery truck ran the red light and you spent three weeks in the hospital, my sister Heather made a strange choking sound. I watched her face drain of all color, turning almost gray under the dining room lighting. I never got any settlement money, I said slowly, a cold feeling spreading through my chest. Still paying off those hospital bills and installments. Uncle Frank put down his wine glass very carefully. Brianna, the insurance company settled for $127,000. I know because I helped your mom with the paperwork when you were still recovering. You were only 17. So it went into a custodial account until you turned eighteen. I turned to my mother, waiting for her to clear up this obvious misunderstanding, but she wouldn't look at me, very interested in cutting her Turkey into impossibly tiny pieces. Mom, my voice came out barely above a whisper. My mind was racing, trying to make the pieces fit together. I turned 18 five years ago. Where did the money go? The silence stretched out forever. I could hear the kitchen faucet dripping in the other room, each drop echoing like a countdown. Gave it to Heather, mom finally whispered, her voice cracking, for her education and getting Started with her life. The words didn't make sense at first. They literally didn't compute in my brain. You gave my money to Heather. I repeated each word coming out separately and distinctly. The money from my accident, from my broken bones and my three weeks in the hospital and my six months of physical therapy. You were getting financial aid for community college, Heather said defensively, her voice shrill and desperate. You didn't need it as much as I did. I had private university tuition and living expenses. I stared at her, actually stared, seeing my sister clearly for maybe the first time in my entire life. Is that where you got your car? The question came out flat and dead. That Audi you bought junior year that you said was from your internship. She didn't answer, but her face answered for her. The apartment downtown you lived in. My voice was getting louder, stronger. The study abroad semester in Paris. The designer clothes you kept posting online. We were going to tell you, mom started weakly when I shouted. Standing up so fast, my chair backward and hit the wall. When exactly were you planning to mention that you stole $127,000 from your daughter who got hit by a truck? The math was simple and devastating. Well, I've been working 40 hours a week at target and going to community college at night, sleeping four hours and living on energy drinks and stress. Heather had been spending my Blood money on her dream life. I called you crying, I said, my voice breaking completely. I called you crying because I couldn't afford my textbooks and you told me to budget better. I was eating Dollar Menu food for dinner while making monthly payments on bills from my own accident. You were always so resilient, Heather said, tears starting to stream down her face. Now you are handling everything fine. Handling it, I repeated the word, tasting like poison in my mouth. I had to drop two classes last semester because I couldn't afford them and work enough hours to pay rent. I've been living in a basement apartment with black mold because it's all I can afford. I haven't been to a dentist in three years. Uncle Frank was doing calculations on his phone, face getting redder by the second. $127,000 plus five years of interest. At even a conservative rate, we're talking about 145,000 to $150,000 in total value you were owed. Mom was sobbing now, but I felt absolutely nothing looking at her tears. She'd had five years to feel guilty, five years to tell the truth. That money was supposed to compensate me for permanent nerve damage in my left leg, I said. My voice deadly calm now. For the nightmares I still have about that truck coming at me, for the fact that I can't run anymore without pain and you gave it away like it was nothing. She's still your sister, mom pleaded. Desperately, no, I said. Clearly, she's a thief who watched me suffer for five years while spending money that belonged to me. That's not a sister. That's a stranger who stole my future. I grabbed my coat from the hallway, my hands surprisingly steady. Now where are you going, mom? Asked her voice small and afraid. To a lawyer, I said simply looking at Uncle Frank, I'm assuming you kept all that paperwork. He nodded grimly. Every document, I'll have it ready tomorrow morning.

I was halfway through a raid in my game when Eli wandered into my room, one hand pressed flat against his chest. He was 8 years old and always interrupting me for stupid reasons, so I didn't even pause. Nana, feel this. He grabbed my hand and put it on his chest before I could stop him. His heart was hammering so fast I couldn't count the beats. It felt like a hummingbird trapped inside his ribs. Dude, what were you doing running laps around the house? He shook his head. I was just watching TV. I pulled my hand back and shrugged. You probably just got excited about something. Go drink some water. He stood there for another second looking at me with those big brown eyes, then shuffled back downstairs. I went back to my game. Mom was working a double at the hospital and wouldn't be home until morning. Dad was on a business trip in Seattle. I was 16 and in charge, which mostly meant making sure Eli ate dinner and went to bed on time. Twenty minutes later, he was back. It's still doing it, he said. This time his voice was smaller. I sighed and paused my game for real. Still doing what? The fast thing? It won't slow down. I tried taking deep breaths. Like you said that one time. I hadn't said anything about deep breaths, but I got up anyway. I put my hand on his chest again. Still racing. Feel that fluttering hummingbird feeling. I looked at him more closely. His face was flushed, but his lips looked kind of pale. Does it hurt? He shook his head, then stopped. Kinda like it's squeezing weird. I pulled out my phone and Googled fast heartbeat in kids. The results said anxiety, dehydration, too much sugar, caffeine, normal stuff. I asked Eli if he had any soda. He said no. Any candy? No. Was he nervous about something? He just stared at me. I'm nervous now because my heart won't stop. Fair point. Got him a glass of water and made him sit on the couch. I figured it would pass in a few minutes. Hearts don't just race forever for no reason. Fifteen minutes later, his heart was still pounding. I could see his shirt moving with each beat. That wasn't normal, right? I counted silently, watching the fabric jump. I got to 60 beats and maybe 20 seconds. That math didn't seem right, but I wasn't exactly a doctor. I texted Mom, Eli's heart is beating really fast. Normal. Three dots appeared, then disappear. She was probably with a patient. I looked at my brother. He was sitting very still on the couch. His hand pressed to his chest like he could hold his heart in place. Jenna, I feel weird. Weird how like floaty, like when you stand up too fast. But I'm sitting down. I grabbed my Phone again and searched, fast heartbeat, dizzy child. The first result mentioned something called s V t, super ventricular tachycardia, heart rate over 150 beats per minute. I scrolled faster. It said to call a doctor if symptoms persisted more than a few minutes. We were past that, way past that. My phone buzzed, mom, how fast is he? Pale, dizzy. I typed back, yes to both. It's been like 45 minutes. Her response was immediate. Call 9, 1 1 now. Don't wait. I'm coming. My.

So my hair is awful, like genuinely awful. It's super thin and curly and every morning I wake up looking like I stuck my finger in an outlet. Giant knots everywhere, hair sticking straight up, frizz for days. My best friend Tori is black and she's seen my morning hair plenty of times. She thinks it's hilarious. Last summer I was complaining about it again and she just shook her head at me. For my birthday two months ago, she gave me a bonnet, the same kind she wears every night. I honestly didn't think it would work for my hair, but I tried it anyway. Dude, game changer. I wake up and my hair is actually manageable now. Way less frizz, barely any knots. I've been wearing it every single night since my dad showed up at my apartment last weekend with his new girlfriend. I say new because my dad has a different girlfriend every few months. This one's name is Brenda and I'd literally never met her before. She walked in with her overnight bag like she owned the place. My dad gave me a hug and introduced us. Brenda barely looked at me. Cool start that night, I got ready for bed around 11. I brushed my teeth and put on my bonnet like I always do. I walked back into the living Room to grab my phone charger. And Brenda just froze. She stared at me like I'd walked out in a full clown costume. Then she goes, what is that on your head? I touched my bonnet. Oh, it's just a bonnet. I wear it to sleep so my hair doesn't go crazy. Her face.

I screenshotted it, smiled, and said, you're right. Then I airdropped it to everyone at the table. Thanksgiving at my parents house. 20 people crammed around the dining table. My sister Lisa and her husband Brett sitting right across from me. Everything seems normal until my phone buzzed. A text from Brett. You look incredible today. That dress is doing things to me. I looked up. He was staring at me, smiling. Lisa was talking to our mom, completely oblivious. Another text. We should grab drink sometime, just us. Then another. Your sister doesn't have to know. What happens between us? Days between us. I felt sick. This man had been married to my sister for three years. I took screenshots of everything. Then I noticed everyone at the table had iPhones. I opened airdrop, selected everyone, sent all three screenshots. Phone started buzzing around the table. My mom checked hers first. Her face went from confused to horrified. My dad's jaw clenched. My brother stood up. What the hell, Brett? Brett's face went completely white. What? What's happening? Lisa grabbed my mom's phone, read the messages, looked at Brett, then at me. Is this real? Check the number. I said quietly, it's his. She pulled out her phone, compared the number. Her hands started shaking. I texted my sister at Thanksgiving dinner while sitting next to me. Brett stammered, I was joking. It was just a joke. Which part was the joke? My dad asked, standing up. The part where you hit on her daughter, or the part where you said your wife doesn't need to know? I didn't mean. I was drunk. You've had one beer, my mom said coldly. Lisa stood up, took off her ring, and dropped it in Brett's mashed potatoes. Get out of my parents house, Lisa. Come on, get out! I screamed it so loud, the neighbors probably heard. Brett tried to grab her arm. My brother stepped between them. She said, leave now. Brett left. The door slammed. Lisa sat back down, shaking. My mom hugged her. We finished Thanksgiving dinner without him. Ask the stuffing. Discuss divorce lawyers. My aunt even made a toast. To family. Who protects family. Last week, Lisa filed for divorce. Cited the screenshots as evidence of emotional infidelity. Brett tried calling me to apologize. I blocked him. Then he tried to claim I manipulated the situation. The screenshots don't lie. Yesterday, my mom asked, do you regret how you handled it? Not for a second, I said. He thought I keep a secret. Instead, I made it everyone's business.

You can't live with us anymore. When I packed up and told them I'd stop paying the bills, my dad, at first I thought I misheard. My mom gave this nervous laugh like maybe he was joking. But he just sat there staring at me, waiting for my reaction. The room went silent. My sister Lily froze, her fork halfway to her mouth. She looked at me with wide eyes like she couldn't believe what she just heard. I swallowed the piece of ham I was chewing and put my fork down. What? You heard me? He said, you're no longer welcome here. You need to move out. I just sat there trying to process. I'm 23, have a steady job, could have moved out years ago, but I stayed because they needed me. I, I paid the electric Bill, the internet, groceries most weeks, things they couldn't afford because my dad had been unemployed for years and my mom only worked part time. I wasn't a burden. I was the reason the lights were still on in that house. And now, out of nowhere, I was being kicked out like some useless freeloader. Mom finally spoke up. Maybe we should talk about this later. But dad interrupted. No, Ed, this is my house. I make the rules. And I say, he's done here. Lily put down her fork. She was only 16, and I could tell she was scared. She stared. At our parents like she didn't even recognize them. If they could throw me out so easily, what did that mean for her? I took a deep breath. I wasn't going to argue or beg. If they wanted me out, fine. But they weren't ready for what that really meant. I leaned back in my chair. All right, I said. My dad sat up straighter like he'd won some imaginary battle. My mom still looked uncomfortable, but she didn't say anything. Maybe she was in shock or maybe she, I just didn't care as much as I thought. I stood up, grabbed my plate and carried it to the sink. I didn't want to give them the reaction they wanted. Instead, I looked at Lily, who was still sitting there, tense and confused. I gave her a small nod. She was the only one at that table I still cared about. Dad took a sip of his drink like nothing had happened. Mom went back to picking at her mashed potato. Lilly kept looking at me like she wanted to say something, but she didn't. I didn't stay to finish dinner, just walked out. I went straight to my room, closed the door and started packing. I wasn't going to waste time trying to understand why they were doing this. If they wanted me gone, I was gone. But that also meant they'd lose everything I've been paying for, and I wasn't going to warn them. I packed in silence. But I could hear them talking downstairs. My mom's voice was low and scared. My dad's was firm, like he was trying to convince her of something. I caught bits and pieces. He's old enough. We can handle it. He should have moved out years ago. An hour later, there was a knock on my door. I opened it and Lily slipped inside, quickly shutting the door behind her. Her eyes were red and puffy. She'd been crying. Are you really leaving? She whispered. Yeah. I said, I don't have much choice. Can I come with you? That broke my heart. You're 16, they'd call the cops. But the second you turn 18, my door's open. She hugged me tight. I hate them for that. Don't, I said. Just remember who was here for you. I left that night. Didn't say goodbye to them, just grabbed my stuff and drove to a friend's place. Three days later, my phone exploded. Mom. I stared at the screen.

I'm in love with Haley, his step sister. Everyone just sat there frozen. They walked out together while I stood there in my dress feeling like I couldn't breathe. But that wasn't even the worst part. I had to call 70 guests myself, explaining why the wedding was off. The next day, they posted photos together online like it was some great love story. Our friends actually took their side. I found out they've been sneaking around for months behind my back while I was picking wedding flowers. They were meeting in secret. I felt so stupid I packed up everything and left her law school where I basically lived in the library. No friends, no dating, just textbooks and this burning anger that kept me going. I specialized in family law. I wanted to understand exactly what makes someone an unfit parent and how to prove it in court. First year, I was sleeping four hours a night. Second year, I was top of my class. Third year, three different firms were fighting to hire me. Meanwhile, Ryan and Haley had a baby and their lives were falling apart. Their parents completely cut them off. They went from posting fancy dinner photos to selling their furniture on Facebook, lost their apartment and had to move in with roommates. Both working minimum wage at the best firm and became their star researcher. 1, 17 custody cases. My first Year never thought I'd see them again until my boss called me in one morning about a new client. He told me the client specifically asked for our firm. I walked into the conference room ready to meet this new client. There was this exhausted looking man in a wrinkled shirt facing away from me. When he turned around, my whole body went cold. It was Ryan, but he didn't recognize me at all. I'd lost 30 pounds, wore expensive suits, now had completely different hair. He just started rambling about his case. My ex is trying to take my daughter. She left me for someone else and now says I'm unfit. He kept talking while I took notes, trying to keep my hands steady. He explained how Haley met some rich dentist at her gym and wanted full custody of their daughter. She was claiming Ryan had manipulated her into their relationship. The dentist was funding her lawyers while Ryan could barely afford our consultation. Then he looked up from his hands and really saw me for the first time. His whole face went white. He said, oh, my god, no, this can't be happening. He started to leave but stopped at the door. My daughter needs the best. That's you, isn't it? I nodded. He sat back down. I spent two weeks building Ryan's case like my entire career depended on it. I found daycare records proving he did every pickup, doctor visits he attended alone while Haley Was posting gym selfies. Court day came and Haley walked in wearing a designer dress and heels. Holding the dentist's hand and actually laughing about something. Then she saw me sitting at Ryan's table organizing evidence. Her smile completely vanished. She grabbed her lawyer frantically, but there was nothing she could do. The judge had already started. For the first hour, Haley's lawyer painted Ryan as controlling and manipulative. He claimed Ryan forced her into an inappropriate relationship. Then we presented our evidence, 60 pages of proof. The daycare teacher testified that Ryan knew everything about his daughter, including her favorite toy, her allergies, her exact bedtime routine. Haley didn't even know her dog.

When my daughter was 16, she got rear ended by a drunk driver while stopped at a red light. The guy was clearly wasted, failed three sobriety tests. But somehow his expensive lawyer was trying to blame my daughter for the accident. The crash left her with a concussion and whiplash. She missed two weeks of school and had to quit her job at the local coffee shop because she couldn't handle the physical demands anymore. But this lawyer was determined to prove she was somehow at fault. During the deposition, he kept asking the same questions over and over, trying to confuse her or get her to contradict herself. My daughter has always been sharp, but head injuries can affect your memory. So I was worried about how she'd handle his aggressive tactics. The lawyer starts with this condescending tone. Now, Miss Johnson, you claim you were completely stopped at the intersection, correct? Yes, sir. The light was red. But how can you be absolutely certain you were stopped? Isn't it possible you were still slowing down? Because my car has something called brakes, and I use them. The stenographer smiled, but the lawyer wasn't amused. He kept pushing. You were on your phone at the time of the accident, weren't you? No, I wasn't. Come now, you're a teenager. All teenagers are on their phones constantly. Surely you were texting someone. I wasn't on my phone. I find that very Hard to believe. What teenager isn't on their phone while driving? That's when my daughter looked him dead in the eye and said, the kind whose parents actually taught her how to drive responsibly. Maybe if more adults acted like adults instead of getting drunk and driving into teenager, we wouldn't need to have these conversations. The room went completely silent. The lawyer's face turned red, but he kept going. Let's talk about your alleged injuries. Concussions are very convenient because they're impossible to prove, aren't they? Actually, they showed up on my CT scan. But I'm not a doctor. Are you? I'm asking the questions here, young lady. Right, but you just asked me if concussions are impossible to prove. And I'm telling you mine was proven by medical imaging. So either you don't understand how CT scans work, or you're asking questions you already know the answers to just to waste everyone's time. Our lawyer was trying not to smile. The other guy was getting flustered. Miss John, isn't it true that you've been milking these so called injuries for attention and to get out of school? Yes, because nothing says fun teenage experience like massive headaches, memory problems, and having to quit the job I loved. I definitely gave myself a concussion just to miss my AP chemistry test. The sarcasm was thick, and even the court reporter was stifling a laugh. But the lawyer wasn't done. He pulled out a photo on his phone and showed This is a picture from your Instagram account posted three days after the accident. You're smiling. If you were really injured, would you be posting happy photos? My daughter looked at the photo, then back at him with this completely deadpan expression.

I'm 32. And last Sunday at her 80th birthday party, she said it in front of everyone, 40 relatives watching while she cut her cake and announced, I love all my grandchildren, but Nathan here, I could never trust him with anything important. My cousins laughed. My aunt whispered something to my uncle. My mom just stared at her plate. Grandma pointed her cake knife at me. He's always been different, secretive, won't tell us what he really does for work. I'm a software engineer, I said quietly. That's what you say, she replied, but you work from home in your pajamas. That's not a real job. My cousin Brandon jumped in. Grandma's right. Real men go to an office. Nathan just plays on his computer all day. The whole room nodded. My sister tried to defend me, but grandma cut her off. And he never visits, never calls, just shows up when there's free food. She looked around for agreement. I'm changing my will next week. People who care about family should be rewarded, not people like Nathan. My uncle stood up. Mom's right, Nathan. You've been coasting your whole life. The rest of us work hard, my aunt added. My son's a doctor. Brandon's in finance. What do you even contribute? I felt everyone staring, waiting for me to defend myself. I didn't say anything. Grandma kept going, when I die, I'm splitting. Everything between people who showed up. Brandon visits every week. He'll get the house, she pointed at me. You'll get nothing. Brandon smirked. Thanks, grandma. My mom finally spoke up. Mom, that's not fair. Nathan's busy with work. Busy. Grandma interrupted. Doing what? Sitting at home. She turned back to the party. Everyone here works real jobs. Brandon's closing million dollar deals. My other grandson saving lives. And Nathan. He laughed. Nathan sits in his apartment doing who knows what. My aunt nodded. It's embarrassing, honestly, when people ask what my nephew does, what am I supposed to say? Say he's unemployed? My uncle said, just it. That's basically what it is. Brandon raised his wine glass to grandma for finally telling it like it is. Half the room clinked glasses. The other half just stared at me with pity. Grandma sat back down, satisfied. I've said my piece. Now let's enjoy the party. The doorbell rang. My sister went to answer it. She came back looking confused. Nathan, there's someone here for you.

I'm driving now. Good luck. I'm so sorry. I ran out of the conference room and drove home going 90 miles per hour. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold the steering wheel. I pulled up our ring camera app at a red light. What I saw made me scream. The footage showed my seven year old Molly and five year old Carl being dragged out of the house by their hair. They were screaming and crying as some, someone threw them into a silver sedan. I couldn't see the person's face but they were wearing all black. I called 9 1 1 immediately.

I stopped at the doorway. This isn't one conversation, Maya. This is you revealing your actual plan for our marriage. You want a free nanny and a night shift worker, not a husband. That's not fair. What's not fair is expecting me to give up everything while you give up nothing. What's not fair is calling it a partnership when it's anything but. She started crying. I thought you loved my boys. I do. But love doesn't mean financial suicide. I packed that night. She kept texting saying I was overreacting, that we could compromise for compromise. I could keep my job, work from home and handle all pick up, drop off, homework, dinner and bedtime, basically still being the full time parent just with a laptop nearby. Then her mom called. You're being incredibly selfish, she said, and without even saying hello. Maya has been through so much with her divorce. She deserves a man who will support her. I agreed to support her, not replace her. Those boys need a father figure. They need a father figure who can actually afford to feed them. Money isn't everything. Tell that to the mortgage company. She huffed and hung up. Then came her sister with a novel length text about how real men sacrifice for their families, how her husband gave up his dreams, how that's what love is. I didn't respond. Three days later, Maya showed up at my new apartment with boys. They were holding a Poster that said we miss you with stick figures. See, she said triumphantly, they need you. Using her kids as emotional blackmail. That was low even for her. Maya, take them home. Not until you come back and apologize. I have nothing to apologize for. You're the one who wanted me to tank my career and our financial future. You're so focused on money. What about love? What about family? Family doesn't mean one person does everything while the other does whatever they want. She left crying. The boys looked confused. I felt terrible, but I knew I'd made the right choice. Last I heard from a mutual friend, Maya's on dating apps now. Now her profile apparently specifies, must love kids, have flexible schedule and understand that family comes first. Translation, must be willing to quit your job and raise my children while I maintain my lifestyle. Her friend said she'd been on six dates. Five guys stopped responding after the second date. The sixth one made it to date four before Maya mentioned her expectations. He apparently said, so you want to stay at home, dad, who also works nights, she said. Exactly. He paid his half of the check and left.

Slipping into the shadows, I pulled out the tools I had brought with me and started working on getting his fingerprints. But as soon as I entered the code, the alarm went off. My heart skipped a beat, but luckily, it didn't wake him up. Refusing to give up, I tried again, and somehow I nailed the code this time. Opening the safe, I grabbed all the cash inside. Then I slipped all the fake bills I had taken from the tire into the safe, replacing the real money. With everything in place, I was about to put the tire, now filled with real cash, back on the car. But at that exact moment, the rich guy suddenly woke up. He spotted me and said his safe had been robbed. I froze, stunned. I had clearly put all the fake cash inside, so why was the safe empty? I followed him to the safe, and sure enough, the money was gone. Then he told me that money was crucial. It was supposed to pay for his daughter's medical treatment. I didn't believe him. For a guy like him, that amount was pocket change. But then he dropped a bombshell. He was bankrupt. The house wasn't even his anymore, and he couldn't afford his daughter's bills. Seeing how desperate he was, I couldn't go through with stealing from him anymore. So I went back to the garage, retrieved the cash hidden in the Tire and came clean to him. But to my surprise, he already knew everything I know. He said. By the way, the thief has already been caught. Caught, huh? Caught? What do you mean caught? How? Don't you recognize your partner

So I left her there without a word. Now her upgrade calls her a fling. She's blowing up my phone, and I couldn't care less. Sarah started making me wait in the car whenever we met. Her friend, just give me five minutes to say hi first, he'd say. Five minutes became 20 after two years together. I'd never actually met most of her friends. The breaking point came at Romano's. I reached across the table to hold her hand while we waited for food. She jerked it back like I'd burned her. Jake, seriously? She glanced around nervously. People might see us. I'm trying to hold my girlfriend's hand. Look, I'm embarrassed to be seen with you in public, okay? You don't exactly fit my aesthetic. The words hit me like a slap. Your aesthetic, my image, my brand. You wouldn't understand. It's a career thing. I watched her angle her phone for a selfie, cropping out any evidence I existed. So what am I, then? You're my boyfriend. Just not publicly. That night, I started paying attention. Sarah posted constantly. Hundreds of posts documenting every aspect of her life. I appeared in exactly zero of them. Her relationship status? Everywhere. Single. Her dating profiles were still active. When friends asked about her love life, she'd sigh dramatically. Still searching for the right guy. It's so hard to find someone on my level. I'd be standing right there. The final straw came at her company party. Just tell people you're my friend from college, she said. Actually, don't talk to anyone unless they talk to you first. At the party, Sarah immediately abandoned me to work the room. Around 10 p m, she was deep in conversation with Marcus from her marketing team. I watched her touch his arm, lean in close, doing all the things she never did with me in public. I walked over to exist in the same space as my supposed girlfriend. Oh, Marcus, this is Jake, Sarah said when she couldn't ignore me anymore. We went to college together. Marcus barely glanced at me. So you're really single? That's crazy. Sarah giggled. I know, right? I'm just so pick. I can't seem to find a guy on my level. I was standing three feet away. What about your friend here? Marcus nodded in my direction. Sarah looked at me like she'd forgotten I existed. Jake? Oh, no. He's, like, not my type at all. Total friend zone material. She laughed. Marcus laughed. I walked away, got my coat, and left without saying goodbye. Two weeks later, I confronted her about everything. Look, you're not exactly boyfriend material for someone like me, she said. I have a reputation to maintain. You don't fit the life I'm building. I need someone who enhances my brand, not someone I have to hide because I'm tired of being your secret. The next day, while she was at Work. I packed everything and left her key on the counter with a note. You're right. We were never really together anyway. Then I blocked her on everything and disappeared from her life as completely as she'd made me disappear from her public image. Sarah got her Instagram worthy relationship. Two weeks later, she and Marcus became official with a professionally lit photo caption. When you know, you know. Hashtag blessed, hashtag couple goals, hashtag authentic. For three months, she lived her best social media life. Then everything imploded. A comment appeared on one of her couple photo. Thanks for helping me realize my boyfriend was cheating. He told me you knew about me the whole time. Glad you were okay being the other woman. Turns out Marcus had been telling Sarah that Lisa was his crazy ex while telling Lisa that Sarah was just a work friend with a crush. Sarah had been the side piece the entire time. She'd left me because I wasn't good enough for her image, only to discover she wasn't good enough for Marcus's. The desperate call started immediately. You were the only guy who actually cared about me, not just how I looked on your

So I crushed her ego by saying she's too dependent to be this demanding. Her parents were visiting for two weeks. Two weeks? We'd always had our system. I work 50 to 60 hours a week, pulling in $140,000 as a software engineer. She works part time from home 15 hours a week doing freelance graphic design, bringing in maybe $18,000 annually. I handle breakfast and pack the kids lunches. She handles dinner since she's home by three PM. It worked. Our kids were happy, fed, and thriving. But the moment her dad walked through our door with his vintage leather duffel, I knew I was cooked. Day one, he criticized my car. That's it? I thought you'd be driving something more impressive by now. Day two, he watched me load the dishwasher after breakfast and actually laughed. My son does that himself. You have a wife for that? Day three, he started commenting in front of the kids, daddy does a lot of woman's work, doesn't he? That's not what a strong man looks like. My wife said nothing. Just gave me these weak smiles. Like that somehow made it okay. By day five, I was mentally exhausted. Her mom joined in, cooing at my wife. You're so lucky he helps out. Most men wouldn't. Like I was the babysitter, not the father. I bit My tongue smiled through it. Kept the P. Then came day 8. The day I stopped caring about peace. I got home at 7:30 p m. Brutal day. Production server crashed, emergency meetings, skipped lunch. My head was pounding. I walked into an empty kitchen. No dinner, no ingredients out. Nothing. My wife was on the couch with her mom, watching some reality show. Both had wine glasses. Both looked comfortable. Hey, I said, loosening my tie, what's dinner? She didn't even pause the show. Figure it out. I stood there, certain I'd misheard. What? You heard me. Figure it out. She turned to face me, her mother smirking beside her. Dad's right. You need to start acting like a real man. Real men provide and don't complain. Stop acting like doing basic chores is some huge favor. The room went silent except for the TV. Her dad appeared from the hallway, arms crossed. You worked all day, her mom said, voice dripping with sarcasm. Welcome to adulthood. Your wife works, too, and she still has to manage everything here. You're failing as a father. Our daughter deserves better. I looked at my wife, really looked at her. She had the satisfied expression, like she'd been waiting for this moment, like her parents validation gave her permission. Something shifted in me. I pulled out my phone, opened our joint banking app, the one that shows all our accounts and contributions. You want to talk about provision? I said, voice eerily. Calm. I turned my phone toward her. See that? That's our monthly expenses. Thousand, two hundred dollars. Mortgage, cars, insurance, groceries, kids, activities, everything. Her mom started to interrupt, but I kept going. My monthly take home after taxes, $8,750. Your daughter's monthly finance income? $1,500 on average. Some months less. I looked directly at my wife. I cover 85% of our life. You cover 15%. And you work 15 hours a week while I work 55. Her dad's arms uncrossed. Now let's talk about chores. I can continued. I make breakfast every single day. I pack lunches, I do dishes. I handle bedtime three nights a week. Because you're exhausted from your four hour work day. The only thing I asked one thing was that you handle dinner since you're home five hours before me. Her face went pale. So here's the reality check you apparently need. I said you're too dependent to be this demanding. If you wanna criticize how I show up as a man, you actually need to be pulling your weight as a partner. You're not. Not even close. I turned to her parents. You raised her to think she deserves a CEO salary. Lifestyle on a hobby. Job, income. I'm not her father. I'm not her ATM. I'm her partner.

Everyone nodded. I said okay and left. Three days later, the bank called them. I was carving the Turkey when my sister Melissa clinked her fork against her wine glass. The room went quiet. We need to discuss something as a family, she said, looking directly at me. We took a vote last week. You're not part of this family anymore. I sat down, the carving knife slowly around the table. My parents nodded. My brother Josh avoided eye contact. My other sister, Emma, was recording on her phone. Even my grandmother folded her napkin and muttered, it's for the best. You voted me out of the family, I asked. It was unanimous, my father said. You never fit in anyway. Different values, different priorities. You're always working, never here for family events. I missed three dinners in five years. You didn't come to Emma's gender reveal party, Melissa added, I was performing emergency surgery. Exactly, my mother said. You think you're better than us with your doctor job and your fancy hospital. We're simple people. You don't belong here. Josh finally spoke. Plus, you never help with family expenses. Melissa needs money for her kids. Emma's starting her business, but you just hoard your money. I paid for dad's bypass surgery, I said quietly. I've been paying the mortgage on this house for eight years. That's different, my father said quickly. That was Your choice. Melissa stood up again. Look, we already decided. Pack your things from your old room. Don't contact us anymore. We'll tell people you moved away for work. My grandmother nodded. The family name stays with real family. I looked at each of them. These people I'd loved and supported my entire life. Okay, I said. I put down the carving fork, grabbed my coat and walked out. My mother called after me. You can't just leave. Finish carving the Turkey. I didn't look back. That night, I made three phone calls. First to the bank. I need to remove myself from the mortgage I've been paying. The woman on the phone was confused. Sir, you're the sole name on this.

I have this terrible habit of doing everything last minute, and I mean everything. Homework done during lunch, project night before, studying for tests. What's studying? I just walk in, pray, and somehow scrape by with a C plus. My parents hated it. Teachers would literally beg me to just try for once. But honestly, it kept working. So why change? Then 8th grade hits and they announce the big one. This massive final exam that decides if you even move on to high school. Like fail this, you're repeating the entire year. Hello. Everyone in my grade was panicking. Kids were making study schedules three weeks out, forming study groups, buying practice book. My friend Terrell dude made flashcards, physical flashcard in 2024. I'm talking color coded, laminated, organized by subject like he was preparing for the SATs. Meanwhile, I'm over here telling myself, yeah, I'll study. I got time. Week before the exam, I discovered this new show, binge the entire thing in three days. Two days before, my cousin wanted to play basketball all afternoon. Did I say no? Absolutely not. We were out there for hours. I came home sweaty, exhausted, and still haven't cracked open a single notebook. The night before, I'm sitting at my desk, stacked up, textbooks open, highlighters ready. I'm ready to lock in. Then I remembered I was stuck on this one level in my game. Just one level, I told myself. One level turned into 12. Suddenly it's 2 a. M. I'm half asleep and I've looked at exactly zero pages of notes. Went to bed thinking, well, it's been a good run. Next morning, I drag myself to school running on four hours of sleep and vibe, literally just vibes. No breakfast, no confidence, no clue. I walk into that classroom and everyone's doing last minute cramming. Terrell's flipping through his flashcards like his life depends on it. Another kids rocking back and forth, mumbling formulas. One girl looked like she was about to cry. Test start. I open the booklet. First question, no idea. Second question, also no idea. I'm reading these questions like I've never seen the English language before. Math section, straight guessing. Science, picking answers that sounded right. Reading comprehension. I'm out here choosing based on what I would have done in that situation. If the character seemed chill, I picked C. If they seemed stressed, I went with B. That was my system. 30 minutes in, I'm done. Not because I finished carefully. There's no point staring at questions I don't know. I turned it in and my teacher just looked at me that disappointed headshake that says I'm not even surprised. I went home fully prepared to tell my parents I'm staying in middle school another year, already planning my excuse, my apology speech to continue.

The reading started exactly how my siblings wanted it to. To my eldest son, Steven, I leave $4 million and the Manhattan penthouse. Steven fist bumped like he'd won the lottery, which I guess he had. To my daughter Diana, I leave $4 million in the entire art collection. She was already googling yacht prices. To my son Paul, I leave $4 million in my investment portfolio. Paul whispered yes and high fived Steven. My youngest son, Marcus, I leave the contents of storage unit 47B, which contains nothing of monetary value. The room exploded in laughter. Diana actually snorted champagne. Nothing of monetary value. Oh, my god. Dad had jokes. Paul slapped my shoulder. Hey, maybe it's full of his old golf clubs. Those might be worth 20 bucks. But I noticed something they didn't. The lawyer's hands were trembling as he folded the will. And there was one more envelope with my name on it. I see the key, I asked. More laughter. Steven pulled out his phone to record. This is too good. Marcus opening his inheritance of nothing. The lawyer handed me a small key and the envelope. Your father insisted you read this privately, probably an apology letter, Diana shrieked. Sorry you were born last. I pocketed both and stood up. Three years of being Dad's sole caregiver during cancer, three years of running the family construction empire while they partied. In Europe and I got nothing of value. Wait, Paul called out, suddenly serious. We need you to keep running the company. We'll pay you a salary, 65 k, Steven added. That's generous for someone with no ownership. Very generous. Diana agreed, considering you just inherited nothing. I walked out without a word. That night, I opened envelope first. Dad's handwriting shakier than I remembered. Son, they think value only means money. Check the unit, then wait for them to call. Dash Dad Storage unit 47B was stuffed with filing cabinets, old ones from the 1970s. I opened the first drawer and my heart stopped. Every original contract, every patent, every client relationship agreement, every single document that proved ownership of anything in our company. But that wasn't the kicker.

I now know the disgusting reason why. When I was seven years old, my older sister Emma, started sneaking into my room every night. She'd wait until I was asleep, then she'd press her hands over my ears and hold them there for hours. I'd wake up sometimes and ask what she was doing. She'd always say the same thing. I'm protecting you. Go back to sleep. I never understood what she meant, but every morning, she'd be gone and my ears would ache. This went on for three years. Every single night from age 7 to 10. Then suddenly it stopped. Emma moved away to college, and I never saw her do it again. I'm 32 now. Emma died last week in a car accident. A funeral. My aunt pulled me aside and said, your sister asked me to give you this if anything happened to her. She handed me a sealed envelope. Inside was a letter in Emma's handwriting. If you're reading this, I'm gone. And now you need to know the truth about why I covered your ears all those years. I wasn't protecting you from something outside. I was protecting you from something inside our house. Something that only came out at night. My hands started shaking. I kept reading. When you were seven, I started hearing voices at night. Not from outside. From the walls, from the floor, from the ceiling. They were whispering. Hundreds of Voices, all talking at once. I couldn't understand what they were saying, but I knew they were talking about you. I felt sick. Emma had never mentioned hearing voices. I went to mom and dad, but they said I was dreaming. They said I was making it up for attention. But I knew what I heard. And the voices got louder every night. They were saying your name over and over, like they were calling you. The letter continued. One night, I followed the voices. They LED me to the basement, to the door that's always locked. The door dad told us never to open. I found the key in his desk, and I opened it. I remembered that door. It was in the corner of the basement behind some old boxes. I asked my parents about it when I was a kid, but they said it was just storage. Behind the door was a staircase going down, way down. I counted 47 steps before I reached the bottom. And what I found there made me understand why the voices wanted you. I stopped reading. I didn't want to know. But I forced myself to continue. There was a room. A big room with symbols painted on the walls. And in the center was a circle drawn in something dark. Something that looked like dried blood. Inside the circle were photos. Dozens of them. All of you. From the day you were born until that week. Someone had been taking Photos of you your entire life. My stomach turned. I kept reading. I looked closer and saw writing under the photos. Dates. And next to each date was a number. I didn't understand what they meant until I saw the last photo. It was from that morning. And next to it was written, day 2 5:57. Final phase begins tonight. 2,557 days. I did the math. That would have been right around the time I turned 7. I ran upstairs, and that's when I realized what the voices were doing.

After 3 exes who destroyed that word, I was terrified. I hate surprises. Hate them. My first boyfriend's surprise was forgetting our anniversary and pretending the gas station flowers he grabbed on the way over were planned. He handed them to me still wrapped in plastic with the price tag on. My second boyfriend surprise was a trip to Vegas. I, I was so excited until I found out it was for his buddy's bachelor party. I spent three days holding purses while they got drunk at clubs. My third boyfriend's surprise was the worst. He broke up with me at my own birthday dinner right after the waiter brought out the cake. He said he didn't want to ruin my birthday by doing it before, so he waited until dessert, like that was better. So when Jordan left a blindfold on my pillow and told me to clear my Saturday, every alarm in my body went off. We've been dating two years. Good years, really good years. But I had good years before. Good years don't mean anything when the bad day finally comes. Just trust me, he said. Guiding me into his car. I wanted to. I really did, but my hands wouldn't stop shaking. The drive took 40 minutes. I tried guessing where we were by the turns and the sounds outside a highway for a while, then smaller roads, then gravel. Nothing made sense. When the car finally Stopped and he helped me out. I heard birds, lots of them, chirping, squawking, whistling. It sounded like we were in a jungle. He pulled off the blindfold. We were standing in front of the city aviary. I blinked at the sign, not understanding at first. Then I remembered I'd mentioned this place once be six months ago. I saw a flyer at a coffee shop and said it looked cool, just a passing comment while we waited for our lattes. I didn't think he was even listening. He was on his phone. You remembered, I whispered. Jordan grinned, but there was something nervous in his eyes. Two years with you, I pay attention. None of my exes ever paid attention, not once. I wanted to cry right there in the parking lot. Inside was magical. Families filled the seats. Kids pointed at bird cages along the walls. Parakeets chirped, a macaw squawked somewhere. A cockatoo whistled a little tune. We found seats in the middle and I couldn't stop smiling. But Jordan kept fidgeting, checking his phone, adjusting his collar, bouncing his leg. The old fear crept back. What if this was the setup for Bad News? What if he brought me somewhere beautiful so I couldn't make a scene when he dumped me? My third boyfriend did that, picked a nice restaurant so I'd be too embarrassed to cry. What if Jordan was doing the same thing? I started picking at my nails, a nervous habit I'd had. Since I was a kid. A woman in khaki pants stepped onto the stage with a grey pigeon on her arm. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Percy. He's a messenger pigeon. Hold up a Bill and Percy takes it. Then he brings back a special note. Think of it as the world's most expensive fortune cookie. The crowd laughed. A little girl went first. Percy swooped down, gentle as a feather, took her dollar and flew back. Her note said, adventure awaits. She beamed at her mom. An older man tried next. His said, wisdom grows with age. He chuckled and showed his wife. Jordan nudged my arm. You should try. I don't know. Come on for me. He was still fidgeting, still nervous. But something in his voice made me reach into my purse. I found a five dollar Bill and held it up. Percy's head turned toward me. He launched from his perch and landed on my armrest, talked his head like he was studying me. Then he took the Bill so gently it felt like a kiss. He flew back to his cage. The woman retrieved a scroll tied with white ribbon and walked it over to me. That seemed odd. The others have been read out loud from the state. This one's special, she said with a wink. My hands trembled as I untied the ribbon. The scroll was longer than the others, real Parchment. I unrolled it slowly. The handwriting was Jordan's, my dearest love. From the moment you stole my heart, like Percy stole that Bill, I knew you were the one. I know surprises scare you. I know people have let you down, but I'm not them. I see you, I hear you. I remember the little things because to me, nothing about you is little. Will you marry me? I read it three times. Ears blurred the words. I turned to Jordan. He wasn't in his seat anymore. He was on one knee in the aisle holding a small velvet box. I know you've been hurt, he said. His voice cracked, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm just asking you to let me love you forever. A little kid in the front row whispered loud enough for everyone to hear. Is she gonna say yes? I laughed through my tears a thousand times. Yes. The ring caught the light as we walked out hand in hand. Percy had delivered a lot of messages, but I like to think ours was his favourite.

Caleb was the sweetest kid I'd ever known. 11 years old, autistic, heart of absolute gold. He had a pet goldfish named bubbles that he talked to every morning. Would stand there in his pajamas telling her about his dreams before school. He was obsessed with anime. Could name every character from My Hero Academia. Talk your ear off about it if you let him. But the thing that got me most was how he treated people at family gatherings. He'd run around giving everyone hugs. Not the obligatory kind. Real ones, tight ones. Like he meant it. If someone was sitting alone, he noticed, walk right over and sit next to them. Wouldn't even say anything sometimes. Just be there for them. I adored that kid more than anything. Then last Thanksgiving happened. Caleb pulled me into the hallway careful so his parents wouldn't notice tears streaming down his face. Uncle, I need to tell you something. His chest was heaving. That rapid rise and fall when someone is crying and hyperventilating at once. I'm getting bullied in school. He told me about these two kids, a boy and a girl. They wouldn't leave him alone. They knocking his anime books out of his hands, calling him names, stealing his peanut butter jelly sandwiches. Sometimes they even shoved him into lockers. I held him while he cried. Have you told your mom and Dad? I asked gently. He nodded. They told me big boys deal with bullying themselves. They told me to figure out how to stop it alone. I watched anime with him until he calmed down. Then I found his parents in the kitchen. Did you. You know Caleb's being bullied? His mom. My sister barely looked up from her mashed potatoes. Kids are mean. He needs to toughen up. His dad shrugged at me. He's exaggerating. You know how Caleb gets. I was stunned. He was sobbing. This seems serious. My sister swatted at the air like I was being ridiculous. We'll handle it, she said. Don't worry about it. Then they changed the subject. Weeks went by. I kept checking in on Caleb, texting and calling him every day. Each time, he seemed a little dimmer, quiet. By the time Christmas came, Caleb walked into the family gathering and didn't hug anyone. All the light had been bullied out of him. While the other kids played and even discussed anime, he sat in the corner alone, staring at nothing. I pulled my sister aside. Something is seriously wrong. Why aren't you doing anything? She snapped. I said, drop it! This is none of your business. I didn't understand. Why were they being like this? Their son was falling apart. Caleb had even stopped taking care of bubbles. The light behind his eyes was gone. I couldn't just watch anymore. I called my sister next week, said I wanted to Pick Caleb up from school, take him for ice cream. She hesitated, then agreed. My real plan was to see and confront these bullies myself. I got to the school on the Friday a few minutes after the bell. Saw Caleb walking out alone, the only kid not picked up yet. I started walking towards him. Then suddenly, two kids stepped in front of him. A boy and a girl. His bullies. The boy shoved his shoulder hard. I picked up speed, marching right at them, ready to end this. Then the girl said something super loud. Loud enough for me to hear, aimed at Caleb. You think we forgot about Sophie? You think anyone's gonna forget about her? I froze. Caleb had never told me about a Sophie. Caleb saw me and ran over. Can we go, please? He started dragging me away, but the girl caught up before we could go. I noticed her eyes were red and puffy, not the eyes of a bully. She was yelling. Sophie never got the chance to run. I looked at her. I dared myself to ask, who's Sophie? The girl stared at me like I was stupid. You seriously don't know? I shook my head. She pulled out her phone, brought it closer to me. I felt Caleb trying to drag me away, but something in me told me I should look at the phone. So I did. A photo of a small girl with down syndrome, smiling, holding a Stuffed rabbit. The girl started talking again. Sophie's my best friend. But she can't come to school anymore because of Caleb. That's when the boy stepped forward. Your nephew's messed up, dude. He used to harass Sophie all the time. Pinch her and take her stuff. And make fun of how she walks. The girl's voice cracked. She can't even talk. She couldn't tell anyone. I felt sick. I looked down at Caleb. He'd stop trying to drag me away. The girl's voice broke. Then he followed Sophie into the bathroom with his iPad. Recorded her and showed everyone. Silence. Try to hang herself with her jumping rope. After that, the boy. The school didn't do anything because he's autistic. His parents know, but won't do anything. The girl wiped her face. So, yeah, we push him because nobody else will do anything. I turned around. Caleb was staring at the ground. The car ride home was silent. I pulled into the driveway. Is it true? I asked Caleb. Nothing. What you did to that girl, is it true? Silence. Look at me. He turned. But his face wasn't sad, wasn't sorry. It was blank. Empty. That's when I realised. The nice kid act was all fake. I stared at him for a long time. You deserve it. He blinked. Everything they're doing to you. You deserve all of it. I unlocked the doors. Get out!

I worked at the same insurance office for almost 10 years. Every single morning I'd stop at Jerry's Coffee on Fifth Street, order my usual black coffee and add what I thought was cream from the self serve station. My co workers always made fun of how strong and bitter my coffee was. They'd take one sip and make faces like I was drinking motor oil. How do you drink that garbage? My, my desk mate Ashley would say, watching me gulp down my morning cup, I just laugh and tell her I liked my coffee with character, strong and bold, just like me. The whole office knew about my weird coffee preference. Even during meetings, people would joke about how I could probably strip paint with whatever I was drinking. For almost a decade, this was my routine. Same coffee shop, same order, same weird looks from everyone who tried it. I thought I just had different taste buds or something. Maybe I was just tougher than everyone else when it came to bitter drinks. Then one Tuesday morning, Jerry's Coffee was closed for kitchen repairs. A handwritten sign on the door said they'd be back in a week. I panicked a little because I'm not great with change. But I spotted another coffee place just two blocks down called bean. There I walked in and ordered my usual black coffee. Please, the young Barista with purple hair smiled and handed me the cup. Then I asked for cream on the side, just like I always did at Jerry's. She pointed to a small metal pitcher next to the sugar packet. I poured in my usual amount and took that first sip. My mouth almost dropped open. The coffee was smooth, creamy, actually enjoyable to drink. Instead of feeling like punishment, maybe this place just had really good coffee beans or something. When Jerry's reopened the next week, I went back to my normal routine. But something was bugging me. Now, why did that other place taste so different? Was their coffee really that much better? I decided to pay closer attention to what I was doing. I walked up to the self serve.

And my best friend tried to kick me out of her wedding because of it. When Riley asked me to be her maid of honor, I cried. We've been best friends since sophomore year of college. The kind of friends who knew each other's coffee orders and Netflix passwords. She'd always been the gorgeous one, the one guys noticed first when we walked into bars. I was the funny sidekick who made everyone laugh when conversations got awkward. I was fine with it. That was just our thing. She got engaged, Connor, in February, and the wedding was set for October, eight months away. When she handed me the bridesmaid dress options at her apartment, she hesitated before saying, so these run pretty small. The designer only goes up to a size 16. And you're like an 18 or 20, right? She said it so casually, like she was commenting on the weather. Maybe we could get you a personal trainer as an early birthday gift. I know this amazing guy named Dominic who works at APEX Fitness downtown. Got my cousin Rachel into crazy good shape. I felt my face get hot, but I smiled and said, sure. She venmoed me $800 that night with a note for Dominic. You're gonna look so good. I met Dominic the next Monday. He was brutal. Six days a week, 5:00am. Full body torture sessions that left me barely able to walk to my car. He put Me on 1,400 calories a day. Mostly grilled protein and vegetables. No alcohol, no. No sugar. No excuses. I started tracking everything in this app called My Plate. I canceled plans so I could meal prep. I stopped going to happy hours. My co workers asked if I was okay because I turned down birthday cake three times. But something clicked. For the first time in my life, I felt in control. By June, I'd lost 40 pounds. By September, I'd lost 70. My face had cheekbone. My collarbone showed. I bought jeans in a size 6, a size I'd never even touched in a store before. I felt like I'd unlocked a secret level of life I didn't know existed two weeks before.

Have you lost your mind? You can't give her to them! As I said, sold for four marks. Terrified, I begged my mother to save me. But my father held me down so hard, couldn't even move. Just like that, I was treated like freight. And hand it over to a stranger, a woman who turned out to be the witch to SEIA. She brought me to eritusa, a place they called a sanctuary of magic. That night, I saw myself in a mirror for the very first time. Ugly, twisted, almost not human. Shame and despair surged inside me. I smashed the mirror with my fist, grabbed a sharp shard with shaking hands, and tried to end a life that felt pointless. But I couldn't. Couldn't even die. The next day, I woke up in Eritrea's Grand Hall with Toseia standing beside me. Shaking with hatred, I clenched my teeth and asked her, do I not even have the right to die? That's adorable, piglet.

And Riley started coughing, not normal coughing. These e violent spasms that sounded like she was choking on her own lungs. Her whole body convulsed with each cough. She coughed so hard she threw up this in stream of bile that flattered on the concrete floor between her hands. Bega didn't even flinch. He just stepped back slightly to avoid getting anything on his shoes. My mom lost it completely. If you don't call an ambulance right now, I will sue this school for every single dollar it has. Go ahead and try, Vegas said calmly. He grabbed Riley under her arms and held her upright like she was a prop. He needed to move. She's going on stage. Riley's legs barely held her. Her face had gone from flush to this grayish color that terrified me. She was still wheezing with every breath. That high pitched whistle that meant her airways were closing. The stage manager's voice came through the headset system 30 seconds to Riley's entrance. Missus Chen was crying. Now, please, please don't do this. Vega ignored her. He positioned Riley at the wing entrance, holding her upright with one hand on her shoulder. Through the gap in the curtain, I could see the stage, the bright lights, the actor finishing his monologue, the audience of 300 people waiting for their lead actress. 20 seconds, the stage manager called. Riley tried to pull away but didn't have The strength, she was using every ounce of energy just to breathe. My mom lunged forward, but Vega blocked her with his body. Touch me and I'll have you removed for disrupting a school function. 10 seconds. Riley's wheezing suddenly got quieter, not better, worse. When an asthma attack, it's quiet. It means almost no air is moving. I knew that from the last time we'd rushed her to the E R. 5 seconds. Vega tightened his grip on Riley's shoulder, positioning her for her entrance. The actor on stage delivered his final line. The music swelled. Riley's cue. And that's when my mom did something that made Principal Vega's face go white.

While 300 students watched my sister Riley collapsed backstage during the spring musical. Not a graceful stage fall. She went down hard, gasping like she couldn't pull air into her lungs. I was helping with tech crew when I heard the thud. Riley was on her knees, one hand clutching her inhaler, the other braced against the wall. Her lips had that bluish tint I'd seen before during bad asthma attacks. Missus Chen, the drama teacher, rushed over. Riley, honey, can you breathe? Riley shook her head, tears streaming. She managed to use her inhaler, but nothing changed. She was wheezing so loud, I could hear it over the opening number playing on stage. Call 9 1 1, I said already, pulling out my phone. Principal Vega appeared out of nowhere and grabbed my wrist. Absolutely not. We have 300 people out there who paid for tickets. Missus Chen looked up from where she was crouched next to Riley. She's having a severe asthma attack. She needs medical attention. She's anxious. Vega cut her off. Opening night jitters. I've seen it 100 times. Crouch next to Riley with his fake concerned expression. You're the lead, sweetheart. Everyone's counting on you. Just take some deep breaths and get back out there. Riley tried to seek, but could only wheeze. The sound was getting worse. Higher pitch, more strained. My mom pushed Through the backstage curtain. She'd been sitting in the third row and somehow knew something was wrong. She took one look at Riley and went pale. She needs a hospital now. Vegas stood up, physically blocking her path to Riley. Missus Hoffman, I understand your concern, but this is a school event and I'm in charge. Your daughter signed a commitment contract. We've sold out three nights. The show must go on. Are you insane? Look at her. Riley was leaning forward now, propped on her hands, using her arms to help her breathe. It's called tripod positioning. A classic sign. And asthma attack is getting danger. I'd Learned that after her last er visit. Missus Chen tried again, her voice shaking. Principal Vega, I really think we should. She goes on in 90 seconds, he said flatly. The curtain call for Act 1 is already running. Her entrance is huge. Get her on her feet. I could see the stage manager through the wings, headset on, counting down with her fingers. 60 seconds.

Nick slipped Ella a small scrap of paper, his home address scribbled in his familiar handwriting. That tiny note instantly became a lifeline between them. As she watched Nick prepare to head straight into the battlefield, her eyes shimmered with longing. His buddies hoisted her up on their shoulders so she could reach him. And right there under everyone's gaze, they shared a kiss soaked in fear, hope and desperate love. Ella felt her chest hollow out as he pulled away. A wave of loneliness swept through her before she even realized it. After they were married, Ella finally gained the high quality medical benefits she'd been hoping for and their bond kept growing stronger through constant messages. Even in the middle of war zones, Nick always carved out a moment to text her little pieces of his life. Between missions, Ella sent back her own world in return. Every morning she snapped a picture of the first sunrise she saw, sending that calm, golden beauty across thousands of miles to him. Eventually, they upgraded to video calls and every time their eyes met through the screen, it felt like their hearts were side by side. Until one day Nick called again. But this time his face was pale and his voice carried a weight she'd never heard before. We almost lost a man today, he told her quietly. The whole team was crushed. Ella Felt panic coiled tight inside her. Meanwhile, the cocktails she crafted at the bar were gaining serious popularity. For the first time, she could fully support herself. But peace didn't. Last phone call from the military shattered it in seconds. Nick had been injured during a mission. Ella's heart clenched so hard it hurt. She grabbed the address Nick once gave her and rushed to tell his father what had happened. The entire family headed straight to the hospital. To her shock, the first thing Nick said when he saw her was a scolding. You shouldn't have told them. Now they're worried sick. And before she could respond, the man pulled from the flames was still hanging on.

She scales tens of thousands of meters with nothing but grit and heartbreak driving her forward. At the summit, she releases his ashes into the open sky, letting them swirl in the winds far above the world. But the moment they turn to head back, latter snaps clean off without warning. Her friend lunges just in time, catching the safety rope before the girl plunges into the void. It's a razor thin escape from certain death, but her friend's strength alone isn't nearly enough to haul her back. So he wraps the rope around a metal post and begins inching her upward muscles trembling with every pull. Just when she thinks she's about to be saved, her friend reacts fast, yanking with everything he's got. His relentless effort pays off as the girl finally grips the last remaining piece of ladder above. She climbs shaking back onto the platform. Both of them are left breathless, shaken to the core. But the nightmare isn't over. Aside from a tiny piece at the top, the entire ladder has crashed down. They're now stranded at a mind numbing, impossible height. In panic, they try their phones. Nothing. No signal this high up. Then luck kicks in. They discover an emergency kit inside binoculars and a flare gun. For a moment, hope flickers back to life. But reality hits hard. The desert below is Empty, endless, lifeless. Still, her friend keeps scanning the horizon, refusing to quit. Finally, she spots an old, half dead RV in the distance. Sadly, it looks completely abandoned by now. They've been trapped for over five brutal hours. Desert Sun is scorching them alive. Suddenly, her friend gets an idea. She types out a desperate SOS message, ties the phone to the rope, and lowers it carefully, hoping it'll catch a signal below. But when they haul it back up, the message still hasn't gone through. Even so, her friend refuses to quit. She decides to throw the phone all the way down. They wrap it in layers of clothing, tuck it inside a shoe, and send it plummeting. When the shoe hits the ground intact, they finally breathe again. And that's when they see him.

After pushing Jack away, he laid down next to gray. When he heard Bill entering the room, quickly closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep. Bill didn't want another guy lying next to gray either, so he tried to shove Luca away. Luca pretended to be asleep, but resisted Bill's efforts. And despite all Bill's strength, he couldn't budge Luca, who nearly sent Bill crashing into Jack. Reluctantly, Bill lay on Gray's other side, and gray, without missing a beat, turned toward him, too. Bill smiled, feeling satisfied, but Luca was far from pleased. Before long, gray woke up. She looked at Bill with a disgusted expression before turning toward Luca behind her, still feeling awkward about it. But honestly, it was better than looking at Bill. Once gray fell back to sleep, Luca caught sight of the defeated Bill and couldn't help but flash a smug smile, even raising his hand in victory. Bill was furious, but he had no choice but to accept the reality. The next day, Emma schemed again and Bill took everyone out to hang out. But Emma intentionally took Gray's seat, telling her to ride in Luca's car, claiming there was no room in the van. Luca couldn't hide his excitement, but Bill was anything but happy. Not only did Emma's plan succeed, but she also mocked Bill loudly, saying grey needed to meet a good Man, this time, Bill spent the whole ride anxiously, while thanks to Emma's help, Luca got to spend the entire time with grey. Meanwhile, Bill dove into studying, Hawking theories, hoping to figure out a way to travel back in time. Luca, on the other hand, worked hard to strengthen his bond with grey, feeling a sense of triumph as he caught grey looking at him.

She never understood why until the day Charlie noticed her sister's face full of swollen blemishes, raised a finger to press 1 and watched the imperfections sink into her skin, sliding down the braid and landing straight on her own face. Terror washed over her completely. Meanwhile, Charlie pulled back the blanket and found her sister's thighs coated in grease and her feet riddled with fungal rot. Mortified beyond belief, her sister pushed both palms against her thighs and shoved hard, forcing the oily mass upward to her stomach. Then she yanked her belt tight and the excess fat traveled through the braid, pouring directly into the girl's abdomen and legs. She witnessed every horrifying second. Then her sister pressed each of her five fungus infected nails onto her fingers and every disease nail regrow on her own hand. She finally screamed, realizing the braid was the true source of all this. She grabbed Scissors to cut it, but the blade snap instantly. Without panicking, he lit the braid on fire. Flames shot several meters high, triggering the smoke alarm. The downpour from the sprinklers was useless. Taking advantage of the chaos, she sprinted out, trying to wedge the braid into the door frame. Ears spilling at last. Then she spotted the fire extinguisher. A brilliant idea flashed. She rushed back inside and saw her sister's face twisted with rage. Without hesitation, she froze her with the Extinguisher then blasted their intertwined hair, turning the braid into icy spikes.

Every time I started dating someone, she quietly sabotaged it, stealthily stealing my boyfriend's watch or jewelry. And more awkwardly, my boyfriend couldn't hold it when nature called. And she always seemed to succeed at the most inconvenient moment. What made things worse was the fatal flaw in our bond. We shared everything we ate. One time my boyfriend tried to feed me steak, but I refused since I was dieting. So he turned and fed it to my sister under the table. She swallowed it in one bite, then tossed the braid and a steak traveled right into my body. I let out an awkward burp, not wanting to waste food. Then my boyfriend handed all the leftovers to my sister, and she happily gobbled it all up for me, the dieter. All that food ended up in my stomach. My boyfriend stared in shock while my sister smirked mischievously. Then when he wasn't looking, he quietly stole the jewelry he was wearing, transferring it straight into my mouth through our connected braid. I was horrified, but she never seemed to tire of her game. While shopping with my boyfriend, my sister took a liking to some jewelry in a store. I had to drag her away, pulling her with our braids. What hurt the most was the growing suspicion that my sister and my boyfriend were Secretly involved, especially after what happened in the fitting room, which confirmed all my worst fears. In a fit of rage, I grabbed my boyfriend's clothes, yanked hard and severed the braid that connected me to my sister, quietly slipping away from all the drama. As for my ex, he laughed as he was wrapped in a curtain. After all, my sister and I could always rebraid our hair later. Now it was time to start looking for the next one.

When he washed with the soap, his skin became pale and smooth. Oh my god! It was like a miracle! But what he didn't notice was a pig's tail growing on his backside. Oh no! Could it be because I ate pork that my husband started showing pig like trait? He then sold this magical soap to a mysterious rich man, who happily paid him $10,000 and placed an order for 10 more boxes. My husband agreed, overjoyed, but I was already skin and bone. I begged him to let me eat the delicious food in the fridge, but he outright refused and instead gave me rotten fruit. Good grief! The smell alone nearly made me throw up last night's dinner. Worse, the soap made from my fat turned black and stank terribly when he used it. His hands immediately broke out in pimple. Terrified, he tossed the soap away. Just then, the wealthy client called.

The paper absorbed the liquid almost instantly. He lifted the note out and unfolded it with care. What had been a crisp, freshly printed Bill now looked naturally aged and weather worn. They repeated the same routine with bundle after bundle. Note dip hung along a string to dry, then blasted with a hair dryer until it looked convincingly used. They went through all this trouble for one reason, every single Bill was fake and worn out. Cash, unlike flawless bills, didn't attract suspicion. To see whether their creations could fool anyone, the pair headed into a tiny corner shop. Riley handed one of the notes to the shopkeeper to buy a small item. The moment the shopkeeper glanced at the Bill, his expression tightened. Something felt wrong. Riley froze, panic rising in his chest. Sensing danger, Jack acted fast. He grabbed Riley's arm and pulled him away. Before the shopkeeper could react, they disappeared into the crowd, escaping by pure luck. They had assumed counterfeiting money was simple, but their very first attempt had collapsed in seconds. Staring at the rejected bills, Jack began to reconsider everything they had been wrong from the very beginning. Real Indian currency used a unique cotton based substrate, a texture completely unlike regular paper. It also produced a sharp, distinct snap when handled. Then there was the color shifting ink changing shades at different angles and the embedded security strip woven into the Note, if they truly wanted believable imitation, they would have to overcome all of those challenges. Even the intricate designs surrounding the portraits would have to be recreated manually, because scanning real bills only made the microscopic text work and expose itself as fake, no matter how expensive the printer might be.

The girl's eyes, once vacant and fragile, now glinted with a strange, unsettling awareness far beyond what a child should possess. Lisa, oblivious to the subtle shift, hugged her daughter tightly, tears of relief streaming down her face. Daughter's gaze lingered on Lucy, sharp and calculating. She whispered a single word, almost too quiet to hear why. Lucy felt a shiver as the room seemed to tighten around her. The experiments, the serum, the countless nights spent meddling with life and death. It all felt suddenly fragile and perilously close to being exposed. Lisa, still holding her daughter, turned to Lucy. Thank you for saving her, she said earnestly, unaware of the darker truth behind her words. But the girl's eyes never left Lucy. It was as if in those brief moments of death and revival she had glimpsed something beyond life, something that made her understand more than anyone should. Lucy's lips parted, wanting to speak, but no words came. The house felt different that night, quiet yet charged, as if the air itself was aware of what had transpired. And somewhere deep inside, Lucy realized that she had awakened something far more unpredictable than she could ever control.

It was Lumen, the woman he had accidentally rescued a few days earlier. Calling in a frantic panic, she claimed she'd shot the man who attacked her and had no idea what to do with the body. To keep her from ending up in handcuffs, he shoved his own target into the trunk and sped toward the address she gave. But when he arrived, all he found was a small pool of fresh blood. Turns out the man wasn't dead at all. So he pulled out the blood, revealing spray he carried for situations like this, and followed the faint trail the wounded man left behind. The path LED them to another abandoned warehouse, and sure enough, the man was barely alive, hiding deep inside a drainage pipe. He dragged him out, but the stranger insisted he'd never seen Lumen in his life. A quick search of his pockets turned up nothing but a driver's license. Guy was merely a children's dentist. His stubborn denial made him question Lumian's story as well. Especially since she'd been blindfolded during the assault. She couldn't be certain this was the man who attacked her. But that only pushed lumian over the edge. She snapped, ramming her high heel into his mouth, desperate to force a confession.

He didn't ask a single question. He simply lunged at Ian and beat him down. Mickey tried to defend him, but his father took him out as well. Then the man dragged in a woman, ordering her right in front of Ian, fix his son and make him normal. Ian froze, completely forced to watch the person he loved being humiliated. Later, he went to see Mickey, but Mickey shoved him away. He said it was to keep him safe and ended their relationship right there. Soon after, Mandy told Ian that Mickey was getting married. Ian was furious, marched straight over to confront him. Mickey offered no explanation, just threw a punch at Ian's face, closing the door on them once and for all. On the wedding day, Ian showed up again. Their eyes met and the feelings were still painfully real. But Mickey held to his choice, saying it was better for both of them. The ceremony went on. Ian watched Mickey hold someone else's hand, knew the story had truly ended. So he walked into a military recruitment office, signed his name and chose to leave everything behind.

Decades of blade mastery flowed through the chieftain's vein. Countless rivals had knelt before his steel, yet the boy stood firm. He met every lethal strike head on. Though youth graced his features, his skill surpassed time earned prowess until the chieftain gathered the boy's weapon, leaving him disarmed. Still, the youth advanced, bare hands seizing the humming blade. He slid forward, delivering a jaw shattering strike, then launched into the air, striking pressure points at stunned neural pathways. Wrenched the sword and hurled It into the void. The chieftain survived, saved by a girl's sudden intervention.

The students, initially just wanting to see him throw up, found themselves working together for the first time.

Though parents begged for him to stay, the principal insisted. Left with no choice, Clark moved to New York to find a new teaching job. Reality hit hard. Schools in the big city weren't keen on hiring a teacher from the countryside. Determined to stay close to his passion, he worked part time while searching for a full time opening.

Every time the boss walked across the glass floor upstairs, it creaked loudly under his feet, and even the metal framework beneath seemed to bend and strain. All these signs clearly suggested that his boss's weight was far beyond normal. What was even stranger was that whenever the boss went upstairs to his office, two employees had to support him as he climbed. But the moment he stepped onto level ground, he could move with surprising agility. The boss also had an unusually sharp sense of smell. So sharp that he could tell from hundreds of feet away exactly which employee had eaten garlic. He'd immediately order that person to go wash thoroughly from head to toe. All of these bizarre, almost inhuman behaviours didn't escape the attention of Jack. When Jack noticed that the second floor floorboards were made entirely of glass, a bold idea crossed his mind. If the glass under the boss's feet were to shatter, the boss would fall through, and Jack could finally confirm whether his boss was truly human or not. To test how much weight it would take to break the glass, Jack quickly built a small computer program. But while he was running his experiments, his boss suddenly appeared behind him. Thinking fast, Jack explained that he was just developing a gravity game. Surprisingly, the boss seemed intrigued and even told Jack To finish the game overnight. The next day, after testing the game, the boss decided it would become the company's next big project. Just like that, Jack, who was supposed to be laid off, suddenly found himself favored by the boss.

The lumps on my wife's shoulders were not a disease at all, but coffee beans glued on with adhesive. The whole plan was to get me out of the way. What followed was something no one wanted to witness. And at that moment, I was completely unaware. Then a cleaner walked by to empty the trash. She found a tube of glue inside the bin. At first I didn't think much of it, but then she took out half a bag of coffee beans. Looks a lot like what was in my wife's can. It doesn't make any sense. And yeah, she's in that room right now. And she doesn't look as good as she does in this photo. But when she saw my wife's photo, she said that my wife came to this hospital every week. I didn't believe her at first because it was my first time bringing my wife here. But the cleaner insisted that she had worked here. For five years and couldn't possibly be mistaken. Seeing her certainty, I suddenly understood everything. I grabbed the glue and coffee beans and formed a plan for it

Her husband feels ashamed and gets angry at her and even pushes on her belly telling her to suck it in. A flight attendant also tries to help, but the belt is just not long enough. The plane couldn't take off for 40 minutes because of her, so the woman is forced to leave the plane and her husband even pushes her out. Make things worse, her husband even asks the flight attendant to go on the trip with him instead. After this embarrassing situation, the woman attempts a strict diet, but she cannot control her appetite and eats even more food. Eventually she goes to a doctor and the kind doctor promises to fix her. A year later, she becomes thin and she can easily buckle her seatbelt on a plane. She then sees someone in front of her getting kicked off the plane for being too fat. She knows exactly how it feels, so she goes to offer support, but she's shocked to see it's her ex husband who has gotten fat. He wants to get back with her, but she refuses because now she has a new loving husband because previously

What would you tell to the university students who is trying to advocate for that, um, in their university to make a change? Yeah, I mean, boy, it's a tough question. I would, I would try to graduate as quickly as possible, get the degree, stand for your own beliefs and your own conviction. These institutions, if they keep on doing d I and CRT, their money is going to dry up. President Trump is gonna defund schools like this if they keep on doing affirmative action. Yeah, he signed the executive order not gonna put up with it. And there's a lot of federal money that, that comes into these institutions. So try to graduate as quickly as possible. Thank you so much. Under Trump's administration, uh, how is energy production gonna benefit us the most? Well, we're gonna drill, baby, drill. Um, and we are going to fix the strategic problem patrolling reserve. One part of this that we're gonna, we're gonna lower gas prices. But think about what's actually raising gas prices. In addition, it's actually not as bad as it was cause Biden has opened up the strategic patrolling reserve to, to lower gas prices for the election. Um, and the Russian Ukrainian war, that war is artificially boosting gas prices. And also make sure we don't go to war against Iran, which would be a profound mistake for Our country. So that that's a really, really important thing. Drill, baby, drill domestically, peace in the Middle East, peace with Russia, Ukraine. You'll see gas prices go down to 30 bucks a barrel. Charlie, what does that mean? Dollar seventy five a gallon. That's what it means. Okay. Because, wait, can you be racist against white people? No, bro. I'm a cracker, bro. What the fuck? No, you can't be racist towards my bro. There's so many crackers here, bro. Haha. What is racism? Oh, it's discrimination based on the color of the skin. Based on the color of the skin. Got it. Thank you. So isn't it racist then to then penalize white people to come into college or to get jobs based on the color of their skin? Wouldn't that be racist? Your world view is indistinguishable from the KKK that you want that you want to organize the world based on skin color. We want to organize the world based on merit and character. I think that all communities will do even better when we stop living under the soft bigotry of low expectations. Inherent in your argument is that we have to pander to certain communities based on the color of their skin because they can't do as well as white people. I want to thank you for something. Oh, yeah. You, you are a perfect reminder why we won a November. So thank you for that. I really appreciate it. Thank you.
