Yeah. For a child you still don't know whether it's yours or not? Exactly. I got served with paper saying I missed my court date and I was a father by default. I work 85, 90 hours every two weeks. I bring home on a good check, I might hit 300. You're working triple shifts. I'm killing myself trying to make sure you're paying the child support. Trying to find a second job right now. I asked her Point Blank, am I the father of the child? She looked at me and said, you're not the father. Real cow. Can't make it up. That's what she said. You are not the father. So she gets more money than my son's mother, which my son is. My own birth certificate signed. That's my blood. When it comes to 5 year old Kenya, Mr Matlock, you are not. I knew it. I knew it.

So a little background. We are full blood siblings. Same mom and same dad. We still all live at home together, just while I'm waiting for my house to be built. I'm 26 and honestly I would say looks wise I'm an eight. Without being too cocky, my body is my best feature. My little sister is 22 and on the plump side. She has a very pretty face, but no curves or cheeks for someone her size. Anyway, this all started about eight months ago when I finished up at the gym earlier than usual because I hurt my ankle. I train Muay Thai for context. Mom and dad were out of town on a camping trip, so it was just me and my sister. On the way home from the gym, I decided to pick up a few items for dinner and surprise my sister, as she had been doing most of the cooking since our parents left. What I didn't know is that she had invited a guy over, which I realized almost immediately after walking in the door because of the sounds that were coming from her room. I ignored it at first and started cooking, hoping they would be finished soon. After about 20 minutes they were still going at it, so without thinking about it, I shouted dinner is almost ready! Hurry up! The poor guy she had overlooked almost right away without saying Anything. The awkward silence we had while eating dinner was too much for me to bear, so just being a smart nerd, I looked at my sister and said, sounds like you had fun. She just smirked and told me to go away before running to the shower. We didn't speak for the rest of the night. I had to be up early for work in the morning, so when I woke up, I went and had a shower. Seeing as my sister never gets out of bed before 8, I figured I was safe to do the naked run back to my room. But when I opened the door, she was right there. I saw her glance down and she let out the faintest oh! Embarrassed with what just happened, I covered myself with my hands and made my way to my room without saying

I was in college at the time and frequently rode the bus to and from school. Yes, there was a college bus. We usually have a uniform at our university, but there was an event that allowed us to dress casually. I was riding home from school when I realized there were no more seats on the bus. I was really tired at this point and just wanted to sit down. At the far end of the bus I saw a familiar face, my classmate from one of my classes during my first year. I walked up to him and said hello. He was kind of a nerdy guy who I found pretty cute. I started a conversation and eventually explained to him why I was tired and tried my best to not sound mean or demanding when asking him for a seat. He didn't hesitate, agreeing and standing up, but before he could do it I managed to sit on his lap first. I'm not entirely sure why I did it as I didn't intend to do so at first. I think my brain just worked too slow lol. I kind of panicked and asked if he minded, but he answered no real quick and that was that. My skirt was so short that when I was sitting down I was sure my panty was exposed. And I take it he felt this as I Felt him immediately get hard. I thought that was pretty hot. So when the bus went through a bumpy road or a hump, I grinded my ass a bit more. I could feel myself getting wetter. I think part of the appeal is that he seemed like a sweet, shy, like, innocent kind of boy. Since the road was bumpy, he held onto the handle on the chair at the front of us with both

A couple days ago, my husband would not let me go out to girls night. He told me I have to stay home because he wanted to go out with the boys. That made me really mad. When he left around 8, I called my boy best friend named Eric to come over and hang with me. My husband does not like Eric at all. He thinks that Eric is trying to get with me, but I don't see it. Eric came over. He bought my favorite red wine and some food. We ate and drink and watched this old Marvel movie. Anyways, I was low key kind of feeling Eric. We started cuddling and he was super muscular and I could feel his veins popping out of his arm. I couldn't resist myself. I whispered in his ear, you know what to do. He understood the message right away. He carried on and it was the best thing ever. That man knew how to eat. He knew exactly what to do. It was my turn to show him that I knew how to eat. I guess I was super good because he couldn't control it. He finished a little early. Honestly, I wasn't even mad because he was cute about it. We just finished the movie and he left because my husband was on his way home. When my husband got home, he apologized. And gave me a little peck. He asked me what I ate because he told me I tasted a little salty. I told him I ate some Alfredo pasta. He asked if I have any leftover because it tastes super good. I told him no and gave him another peck. He was annoyed that I didn't save him any, but told him he could clean the rest off of my cheek. And he did. Revenge is so sweet and salty, isn't it

After this experience, I have started believing in a higher power, specifically my sister's tongue. She and I are both very active in the bedroom. The only problem we both have is that sometimes one of us takes an incredibly long time to finish, sometimes resulting in an hour of straight pounding, which leaves us both with friction burns on our pelvis. We throw toys into the equation, and while they definitely work, we are always searching for something better and better. One of the things we recently stumbled across was aphrodisiac chocolate, made to enhance pleasure. Both intrigued, we decided to buy some online from tabs, and the results were not what I expected, to say the least. When we ordered it, we made a pact not engage in any intimate activity until it arrived. To see how good these things really were. They came four days later, and that same day, I came over to my sister's house. Just my luck, as our parents were there. But was I really going to let that stop me? Hell no. If mom catches us, she could join in for all I cared. She's hot, too. Anyway, after exchanging some formal pleasantries with our parents, we headed upstairs. The look dad gave me showed he very much knew that his daughter was about to get pounded with him. There. But once again. Oh well. So when we got to my sister's room, we ate the tabs of chocolates that had arrived and took a little more than the recommended amount each. We waited for it to kick in, and it did almost instantly. The next 20 minutes were spent teasing each other and making out. Then I got the urge to get some brain. I asked my sister if she could tie me up and blindfold me, then go to town. And being atrium herself, she agreed before I even finished my suggestion. The next 20 minutes could only be

Price is $250,000. Great. Is there any damage on the vehicle? Maybe a small rip on the passenger seat. Uh, yeah. How did you know?

Go to that underground garage and park it up. Hide the keys in the wheel well, and then run away as fast as you can. Okay, I'm going now. Please don't tell the Mafia. I won't. Okay, I did it. Good. Girl. Babe, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have tried to sell your car. Why the sudden change of heart? It had money hidden inside it. Stolen from the Mafia.

Wait, that was you? You're so blonde. How could anyone own it before me? I bought it from the dealership. Babe, please forgive me. It was just a silly mistake. Now we're getting a divorce. And after the judge hears this, you won't get a penny from me. You'll be homeless. You for the streets anyway. No, baby, you can't make me homeless. Boohoo! Woman up!

For whatever reason. My f roomie was out with her friends so they took it out on me. My three housemates were wildly lusty. You undoubtedly know from reading my posts the three of them can fund me whenever they want. One arrived last night when I was watching reels in my room. He said he would be quick and to keep doing what I was doing since he was harkey. He entered me and caressed my back while I scrolled Instagram and read it for gloom. It felt great, like maximum stimulation lol. He promised and arrived in my cat shortly after. Give me before leaving. The next person entered after five minutes. Can't remember if I put my shorts back on. After saying my cat was clean, he slipped into me and fun me without asking. Though he didn't massage me, it was pleasant to focus on my phone. My cat was messy and full of milk and he quickly joined in. My cat felt and sounded like I was full of milk and not done. He probably waited outside for my last roommate to finish funding me before he came in. That sloppy cats I was hilarious. I was so excited I heard our other roommate come home while hammering me. My door was open when she came over to watch me being funded and wait before leaving to fetch her belongings. In her room, the third guy pie me and say, did you sprinkle yet? When I informed him I didn't, he promised to fix it and return quickly. After leaving, he reappeared with my female roommate who had just got home. I spread my legs and he grabbed her hair, adding cat needs you. She didn't sprinkle yet. I made her suck and eat me from behind while shoving her face into my triple pie cat. He kept smashing her face into me till I come out. As she left, I saw her face was soaked in her cheek head sealant. After the kiss, I tasted milk from the man and her. The place was a mess.

One. I was over at the apartment of a woman I liked and asked to borrow a shirt because mine was dirty. She said, here, use this one and took off the shirt she was wearing. She wasn't wearing a bra. She threw it at me and then kept talking to me for a few minutes with glass cutters out before going to the bathroom to have a shower. Two. I used to go skinny dipping in the river and at the local hot springs with a bunch of friends in high school. Some of them were pretty spicy. That's how I Learned to look without staring. Three. Back in college, of course, I had a roommate senior year. He had a pretty serious GF that slept over regularly. Apparently she slept in the UAE. There were a few times she would come out of the bedroom to grab a snack. Completed. Eight. The first few times I stumbled over my words, but she didn't care. Four. A friend and her husband have a cabin in the woods and nudity is becoming more and more regular when me and my Bf are there. Usually in the hot tub and sauna. Five. At a house party in uni, a friend of mine comes into the bedroom I'm staying in and gets down to just boulder holder and drawers and says we're sharing tonight and gets into bed as the little spoon. We went on to have a friends with benefits situation a few months later, and I asked if she was trying to fun time that night too. Apparently she was just tired and wanted to cuddle. Six. I was like 10 and getting my haircut by the hot barber with huge lady lumps. She happened to get a tattoo on her chest. I asked about it and she decided to show me. Big old lady lump, flop right out.

That's not how that works. And you are from Louisiana. I mean, that might as well be another country, but you are still from the U S. So shave it. You wanna get in it, don't you? Yes, actually I wanna eat it all up. But I do not want my face to get pricked. What makes you think I would let you eat some of it? I am 6 foot 2 and have about nine inches. Yeah, you can have it. But I really don't want to shave it. I've worked so hard on it. I'll be giving it fades and plucking the outline hairs. How smooth is the surrounding areas? Really smooth. I get them waxed like once a month. So you promise it's not no jungle? I promise. Wait, you clean shave, right? No, I like having a forest. Well, what if I want it smooth? Well, you are gonna have to find me a barber for my Johnson. Cause there is no way I can get through all the hair I have with just a razor. Dude, that is disgusting. And I can't Have a landing strip, but you can have a full blown forest. I mean. Yeah. Well, how about this? If I shave mine, you have to shave yours. Then we can get with each other. But I like my bush. It makes me feel like a real man. Dude, shut up. You want cat or not

Two days ago. Well, would you at least clean it up for me if I got with you? Why would I clean it up? Other guys don't have a problem with it. So you either want it or you don't. Yes, ma'am. Now, I have availability on Tuesday of next week at either 10:00am to 11:00am or six thirty PM to seven thirty PM. The longer sessions are for more experienced workers. You have appointments for this stuff? Yeah. Yes. Will you be using cash or card? Or we could even finance. How much does it cost? For 30 minutes it is $800 and an hour is $1,500. But it is more expensive earlier in the day cause I have less loads in me, whereas at the end of the day I'm stuffed like a Twinkie. You are expensive. Am I limited to one load? Nope. You can have as many as you can produce in your time frame. Awesome. Am I allowed to ask You to put on a strap and do it to me? No, I'm not into all that weird stuff. Just want Johnson really bad, though. I might as well get paid for it. That's fair. I'll give you 5 racks if you shave it for me and shower in between me and the guy before me. Say less. I'll even get a Brazilian if you throw in another rack. Yeah, go for it. My wife has been cheating on me. I just need some right now. Well, there is one rule I have. What? No emotions. Just scream my name and move on with it. Okay. So are you using cash or card? Cash. Is there any way I can get a monthly subscription? Subscription. That would be like 10 K a month. And you can get it twice a week. Deal. You are down bad.

Earlier today I was running some errands, and one of them was doing the week's laundry. The place was packed, so I decided to wait for my clothes to be done outside. A guy approached me and we started chatting. He was handsome and charming, and I was feeling quite flirty. He asked me what I was doing, and I explained that I was waiting for my laundry. He said he was in the same situation and offered me a cigarette. We smoked and chatted some more, and I could feel myself getting wetter by the minute. I've been feeling quite lonely, so any male attention drives me to the edge. We're laughing and joking, and suddenly he grabbed me and pushed me against the alley's wall. He started kissing me and I was so turned on I couldn't resist. I unzipped his pants and got on my knees, sucking his D like a mad woman. I was playing with his tip, using my tongue, massaging his ball bag while he held my head with two hands and smiling at him like a sloop from the movies. We were both out of breath, but I didn't want to stop. I unzipped my pants and bent over and he f'd me from behind. It was wild and rough, and I loved every second of it. He was holding me by my hair, effing me like an animal. I wanted to Moan and scream and ignore the other people. But I didn't think anyone in the laundromat could ignore what was going on. So he kept me shut while going at me. His hands were strong and significant, leaving a few marks around my body. He was going so hard that I could swear I was in heaven from his strength. I could hear him boding quietly behind me, and it sent shivers all over my body. He would rub my bean while effing me, and it was driving me insane. He turned me around and sat me on an old bench, and he continued to eff me, this time slower and more passionate. He would kiss me while entering me, and he would look me in the eyes while thrusting. He picked up the pace again and we were both close to finishing. This time we were both sweating and breathing heavily, and I felt like I would bust at any second. When he finally came inside me, I felt so satisfied and happy that I came too. He helped me up and we got our clothes and left. Things were so good that I didn't even realize how dumb I was for letting a stranger f me without a condom and bust inside. But I must admit that I loved everything I'm now.

He held my head and moved it back and forth slowly. I felt a rush of liquid into my mouth. I stuck out my tongue to show it to him and asked, is this yours? It was as if his sanity was broken because he yanked badly on my waist and slowly entered his soldier. It was my first time and it felt like something was tearing inside me. Do you don't do it raw. Use condom. It was not okay to suddenly enter me because his cucumbers was huge. After all, just the tip that came and made me feel like I was going crazy. W e can't. I told you. Don't regret your decision. Unbeknownst to me, tears were dripping down the side of my eye. I hugged his neck to relieve the pain I was feeling. The discomfort did not go away. I sobbed because the ache was excruciating. S s h okay. Don't worry. I won't move unless you permit me. He brushed my head down on my back to calm me down. A few minutes past and the pain I was feeling gradually disappeared. I removed the hand wrapped around his neck and looked him in the eye. I kissed him on the lips and he put his tongue inside my mouth. I could feel the heat of his breath and saliva reaching my mouth. You can move Now! I told him impatiently, but he didn't speak and just laid me down on the mattress again. Ah, hmggg! I growled, as he opened my legs as if they were about to tear. He pounced me rashly, so I cleaned to the sheets. I lifted my body as he moved even faster. Sweat was already forming on his forehead as he closed his eyes. I looked at him with my breathless face, while there were a few tears in my eyes. But I didn't know the reason why his cucumbers had gotten more

My name is Anita and I'm 18 years old. So I'm going to put my family situation aside for now and share my story. So when I was 16, I had to spend a night at my uncle's house. He was a tall and very muscular man and I always liked him tbh, but nothing structurally to this point. Anyway, I didn't want to sleep alone and he told me I can come and sleep with him. He said to go and shower and come to his room and not to feel embarrassed. I was embarrassed. I put my little Nike Pro dress on and went to his room. To my surprise, he was just laying there and watching corn on the tea. He didn't try and hide it or anything. We just both pretended that is nothing. But honestly, my heart was beating so fast and I wasn't sure about sleeping there. I laid next to him, turned my back to him and tried to sleep. But then he started shaking the bed and turn the volume of the corn really up. All I could hear was women screaming their stuff like yes, daddy pound! And much more crazy things. After about 10 minutes, I tried to sleep, but I just couldn't. So I just pretended to be asleep and turned around because I was curious. I opened my eyes a little bit and saw his huge magic wand. Pulled out his Pocket. As he was rubbing it, he was looking on my cherries. And then he put it, this magic wand into my cat very fast. And then I just woke up in the morning with salty cream on my face. Do you know what it could be? Maybe it was just my sweat. What do you think about this whole situation? Follow for more.

I was at the grocery store when I saw her. She was pushing an empty stroller after leaving her kid at daycare. We started casually chatting and she was extremely flirty. Since it was my day off, I invited her for coffee to my place, which is in the same building as the grocery store. Coffee was not even ready when she came onto me, pulled down my shorts. Since my legs hurt a lot and I couldn't do it myself. She started savagely eating my pickle. Her level of desperation for fun was remarkable. She was hungry for pickle. She stopped eating, took off her pants, bent over the table, and offered me her wonderful cat. She got loudly as I went in, and once I was deep down, she surprised me with an instant oh! And it was so extreme, her whole body shook as if she was cold. 10 months, she said. Ten months since my piece of trash husband last had fun with me, she said. I felt bad for her, but before I could think anything else, she continued undressing. I really could not understand how a man could not want to have fun with her. I'm sure she gained a few pounds from pregnancy, but her deep blue eyes, her soft skin, her large melons, her wide hips and big behind made her a dream. She ended up staying for most of the day to explore And do everything. She let me give her a cream pie that I had baked earlier. And she ate my pickle. She swallowed and even had an intense O moment while swallowing. I played with her cat. I slapped her behind and left a handprint. Later we showered together and that was the end of it. Maybe she just used me. But I hope she calls again.

I'm only filming with you. And other women you wanna get with. So no other men? Nope. I think you made me jizz. Huh. I have to be the luckiest man alive. There's one thing my fans want, though. Sure. Anything. They want me to put a strap on and peg you. Wow. I'm not the luckiest man in the world anymore. You at least kiss it after? Yes, baby. I'll nurture it after. We can do it then. You are the best. But I get to get with your mom whenever I want after this, right? Yeah. She wants our house to be free use whenever my dad is not there. At least this is the life I've always dreamed of.

My husband asked two of his friends to come over. As the friends of my husband stood in front of me with their corns, I couldn't help but feel a little creepy. There I was about to put both of these hard corns in my mouth at the same time. Knowing that my husband was watching. It was something I had never done before. But before they could say anything, I. I reached out and wrapped my hands around both of their corns they had at the same time. Following that, I slowly put my lips on one of them and took as much of it as I could before quickly moving to the other one. I didn't even think about it. The couch next to us had my husband sitting down and I could see his eyes on me. I didn't care, though. Giving both of these guys the best work I think they had ever had was the only thing that mattered right now. I kept moving my lips up and down along their corns while rubbing them with my hands at the same time. Soon I could feel each of them getting thicker. Eventually, they both got so excited that they jumped up and kissed my face. As the last few drops fell on my tongue, I couldn't help but smile at them. It had been an amazing event for all of us. I knew that this was the start. Of more fun to come between the three of us as we stood there after it was over

My professor's hot. Insanely hot. I never miss any of his lectures. Because missing it means I miss seeing his gorgeous face. He's a young professor, only a few years older than me. I think about him whenever I do the deed. And have tried avoiding dating. Because I want him to know I'm available for him. I've gone to all of his office hours and tried to make as much physical contact as possible. Then the dry spell happened. My professor went on vacation for a week. A whole week without the hottest human being alive. I could have cried. I was infatuated with him. Obsessed, even. I just wanted him. He came back and I scheduled a private meeting with him. I told him it was super important, and he agreed. I decided to wear the sltiest outfit I could find. I was on a mission, and that mission was to bang him. I got there and got to seducing. I could tell. He tried his best not to look at my breasts. But my top left nothing to the imagination. And he just couldn't look away. I was straightforward with him and told him I wanted to sleep with him. He chuckled and said he could tell. And if I could just lose it right then and there. I practically jumped across the table and sat on his lap. He kissed me and F me everywhere in his office. It was The hottest night of my life. My attraction to him only grew deeper. And I f him whenever I could. I could tell he was sore in class. It made my ego inflate to see him struggle to teach because of it. He kept looking at me and got flustered. I never had the fantasy of sleeping with one of my teachers. But now that it happened, I couldn't stop. I was addicted to him. This dragged on for months. I didn't know if I wanted to keep this relationship purely physical. Or if I wanted to date him. The idea of him with another woman made my stomach turn. But dating is a big commitment. And the teacher student relationship makes this much more difficult. Should I date my professor or keep things casual? You would want to date this man if you saw how he looked.

My eyes widened and I didn't know what I was expecting, but just the moment the man pushed himself into me. I'm disillusioned with my first time. I thought it would be romantic and full of tenderness, but at that moment reality hit me. When the real pain struck, I screamed out loud. It felt like trying to escape hell, but he was like an immovable mountain crushing me. I scratched his shoulders, trying to ease the pain, but Alex's eyes showed impatience. Be a good girl, he ordered coldly, making my body stiffen as I trembled with fear. Couldn't he have said something gentle in that moment? But no, he commanded me as if I were his pet. I opened my mouth to curse at him, but he swiftly captured my lips as if to devour them and shut me up. I tried to push him away again. He grabbed my hands and pinned them above my head, leading me to struggle beneath him like a helpless fish. I never expected this man to be so rough in bed. His other hand wrapped around my waist, moving slowly across my body, inside and out, until I started to forget the pain. I don't know when exactly the pain faded away, but at some point I am brace him, allowing him to explore the deepest parts of me, not just my body, but my soul. As well. This man had turned me from a girl into a woman, showing me a whole new world, even a new version of myself. Alex didn't seem to realize what he had just done.

I mean, kinda. But we all make mistakes. Plus, he says that you are really good in bed. Really? Yeah. If you want, you can keep dating him, but we get to have three ways, and he can sleep with me when he wants. Really? Yeah. That sounds awesome. His Johnson is so big that there is no way I can take it as many times as he wants in a day. Trust me, I know. That thing is like a horse. I have something that will be awesome for us, though. What is it? When it is just us three at our house, we can just have a free use house and I'll just stay unclothed so we can all just get it when we please. That sounds awesome. Wait, are we basically just having a Three Way relationship? Yep. But I mean, as soon as you get a boyfriend, he can join in. So you can still sleep with My boyfriend and I can sleep with yours. Oh, my gosh, that sounds amazing. There's one rule. What is it? He can't be ugly. And he has to have the same size stick as my boyfriend. So, 13 inches long and two inches wide? Yep. So hung like a horse. Yeah. We gotta have an even playing field.

I lost a bet with my hubby. I lost a bet with my hubby where I agreed that I would have love with him anytime he wanted for a whole week. It was a wild week. It started on a Saturday morning and he took full advantage. The first time I woke up before him and was in the kitchen making us breakfast, came into the kitchen wearing just his boxers and lifted my robe and pulled my panties down, forcing me to remove them and throwing them to the side and saying that I would not need them this week. He wouldn't let me stop cooking as he banged me from behind and played with my. He ended up busting his loads in me and told me to keep the robe on for today since he liked the easier access. A few hours later, I was doing chores when he came into the room and whipped it out in front of my face. Knowing what he wanted, I started slurping him until he eventually bent me over and went to Pound Town. I never did something like this before, but it made me feel like a woman doing her feminine duties and I loved it. I loved pleasing him this way. He ended up freaking me eight times that first day. During the week he ended up freaking me in all kinds of wild places, like on a video. Call with my boss in my office, at work, in the woods, on a hike, in a park, and even on a bus. He would also use a remote control vibrator when we're in public. It ended up being really hot and helped our love life a ton. Even though the bet was over. I say yes to make love way more and always try to be ready even when I'm not in the mood, because with a few strokes in, I'm going to want it.

Things haven't been great between us for a few months and we haven't had intimacy at that time. I work from home and I was in my office when my wife came in. She had been laying out by the pool and was wearing a bikini with her skin glistening from sweat and oil. Do you have any cndms? She asked. I don't think so. Why? My heart immediately began beating faster. I'm off my birth control and I've been incredibly achy all day. I've tried using toys and nothing is working. Just now, outside the window, my skin was driving me crazy. I need you to have intimacy with me, but you have to use a CNDM. Let me check, I said, and ran to look. She flopped down on the couch and waited. Unable to find any, I returned. Listen, there's a pharmacy right down the street. I'll run out and get some and be right back. She seemed a little annoyed, or maybe disappointed, but agreed. I rushed out of the house to the store and back, thinking she was still in my office. I went there first, but it was empty. I then crossed the house to our room. The door was open and she was on her knees on the floor, leaning back with her bikini bottoms pulled down and a toy between her legs. She didn't start masturbating until several years into our relationship, and Was too embarrassed to ever let me see. So this was literally one of my fantasies come true. I helped her up onto the bed, and we started removing her swimsuit. I then knelt down and began to eat her out.

Lately he's been walking around in just his boxers while being extremely hard, and he's stroked it while looking at me on numerous occasions. Along with that he's gotten a lot more physical. Yesterday morning he came into the kitchen with a hard on and hugged me from behind very tightly. He began to move a little and I could feel his dingle, stiff as a rock, nestled in my butt cheeks. After a bit of a struggle I got him off me, but he just went and sat down in the living room and wiggled while looking me, specifically my lower half. He also got a little frisky when I was tanning a week ago. I was on laying on my stomach when he comes up to me and asks if I need more tanning oil slash sunscreen. I told him not really, but he grabbed it anyway, straddled my butt and started rubbing lotion anywhere he could. I could feel his heart growing in his pants as he did this. And before I knew it he had his dingle out while he was on top of me and he then pressed it against my butt and began to do a humping motion. And as I was telling him to stop, he shot his load all over me. He walked and didn't say a word after that. Are all boys like this?

I didn't think twice about and as soon as I saw them, I pounced on my brother and started beating him. My girlfriend left the room as quickly as she could and went downstairs to ask for help. When my father and uncles came up, I was still beating the poop out of my brother. His face was full of blood, as was my knuckles. My father was the one who had to separate us, but I kept insulting him and hitting him. In the end he was able to separate us and then he took me out of the room while my uncles checked how bad my brother was. Outside the room, my father asked me what the hell had happened to make me act like that. It took me a while to be able to formulate words, but finally I told him. But I had just seen that my brother had tried to abuse my girlfriend. My dad. I know I was in shock for a while. He sat on the floor and put his hand on his forehead and was completely silent for about 10 minutes until my uncles called him because they were going to take my brother to the hospital. After they took my brother, I went to look for my girlfriend and found her talking to my Sister. About what just had happened. I said goodbye to my sister and we left. All the way to our house, she couldn't stop crying. She was confused, angry. And by the time we got home, she kept crying until she fell asleep. And that was her routine for a couple of days, until little by little, she could talk again. In those days, my family kept me informed of my condition. Brother. I had broken his nose and dislocated his jaw. My mother was the one in denial. Incredible that her son was capable of something like that. But I didn't think much about it, because in the end, each person reacts different. And also, to a certain point, I understood why my mom was trying to explain my brother's actions. Last thing I heard from him was that after he left the hospital, everyone turned their backs on him for what he did. They fired him from his work and left town. When I consulted a lawyer friend of mine, she told me that if I press charges against my brother, he could also drag me with him. I was going to be in jail for some time. And also that my then girlfriend needed to testify. And she wasn't in the best moments for something like that. Also, my priority in that moment was her. I couldn't help her if I was in jail. The best we had at that time was a restriction order for her. We decided to got therapy because my girlfriend said that she feels threatened. After several sessions, things finally start looking better. We both improve our mental state. Four years passed and I proposed to her. When I told my family, everyone congratulated me. But my mother remained a little quiet and when no one was looking, she asked me if we could talk alone later.

I lost a bet with my hubby where I agreed that I would have with him anytime he wanted for a whole week. It was a wild week. It started on a Saturday morning and he took full advantage. The first time I woke up before him and was in the kitchen making us breakfast, he came into the kitchen wearing just his boxers and lifted my robe and pulled my panties down, forcing me to remove them and throwing them to the side and saying that I would not need them this week. He wouldn't let me stop cooking as he banged me from behind and played with my. He ended up busting his loads in me and told me to keep the robe on for today since he liked the easier access. A few hours later, I was doing chores when he came into the room and whipped it out in front of my face. Knowing what he wanted, I started slurping him until he eventually bent me over and went to Pound Town. I never did something like this before, but it made me feel like a woman doing her feminine duties and I loved it. I loved pleasing him this way. He ended up fucking me eight times that first day. During the week, he ended up fucking me in all kinds of wild places, like on a video call with my boss in my office. At work, in the woods, on a hike, in a park, and even on a bus. He would also use a remote control vibrator when we're in public. It ended up being really hot and helped our sex life a ton. Even though the bet was over. I say yes to say way more and always try to be ready, even when I'm not in the mood, because with a few strokes in, I'm going to want it.

It's official. You're the only guy on our street. Congrats. You're king of the estrogen kingdom. Oh, no. What happened now? Another text from Karen. Wants you to fix her toilet again. Tell her to call a plumber. I did. She said, why would I call a stranger when I have you? I'm starting to regret being nice when we moved here. Oh, it gets worse. Jessica sent me a picture. A picture of what? Let's just say her shirt was not in the frame. You're kidding. Nope. Want me to forward it? Delete it now? Too late. I'm printing it out and sticking it to the fridge. Don't even joke. Okay, but what about the single mom who asked you to discipline her kid? You're not dad for hire. OMG, stop it. I'm moving out. No, you're not. You're staying here and suffering with me. They're your problem now. You're the neighborhood president or whatever. Oh, I tried. I held a zoom meeting, remember? Yeah. How'd that go? They basically told me to share you. Said I was selfish for keeping you all to myself. I'm not a community toolbox. According to them, you are. Also, it's apparently my fault for not giving you kids. What? Yep. They think you'd stop being interesting if we had a couple of toddlers. I don't even know what to say. Don't worry. I shut it down, but they're not gonna stop. So what now? Do I start charging a handyman? Fee. Great idea. $50 per light bulb. Hundred dollars per toilet. $500 for discipline advice. Cash only. You're evil. Evil or genius? Both. Love you, Mr. Popular. Good luck with Karen's toilet. I'm blocking her number. I already did. You owe me a snack.

I'm three hours away. That's too far. I'm selling it now. I bought that car when my dad passed away. You can't sell it. Boohoo! Man up, bet. Do you still have the yellow Ferrari? Yes. Price is $250,000. Great. Is there any damage on the vehicle? Maybe a small rip on the passenger seat. Uh, yeah. How did you know? That was my Ferrari five years ago, before I got kidnapped by the Mafia. I'm sorry to hear that. Are you here to buy it, or are you just reminiscing? The Mafia was trying to find the money I stole from them, but they couldn't. Do you want the car or not? I don't have time for stories. Okay, I'll cut to the good part. The money I stole is hidden in that Ferrari. Is the Mafia gonna find me? If you don't do exactly what I say? I will tell them you have the car. What do I need to do? Go to that underground garage and park it up. Hide the keys in the wheel well, and then run away as fast as you can. Okay, I'm going now. Please don't tell the Mafia. I won't. Okay, I did it. Good. Girl. Babe, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have tried to sell your car. Why the sudden change of heart? It had money hidden inside it. Stolen from the Mafia. This guy messaged me and told me to hide it in a garage, so I did. Now I'm just running home. I don't know what to do. Are you almost home? Yes. Thanks for keeping it safe. Stupid ass. Wait, that was you? You're so blonde. How could anyone own it before me? I bought it from the dealership. Babe, please forgive me. It was just a silly mistake. Now we're getting a divorce. And after the judge hears this, you won't get a penny from me. You'll be homeless. You for the streets anyway. No, baby, you can't make me homeless. Boohoo! Woman up!

Let's go. Nah, I'm good. I'd rather stay here than become a human high chair for your niece again. Oh, my god. You're still upset about holding her? She's a baby. It's not a big deal. Not a big deal? I've been holding her more than her own parents. I'm practically her second mom at this point. That's because she loves you. She puts her arms out for you all the time. She loves me because they've made me her default babysitter. Let's not confuse love with forced bonding. Babe, you just need to say no. You're making this harder than it needs to be. Say no. Half the time they don't even ask. She's literally thrown at me like, here's a baby. Good luck. Okay, but you're overreacting. It's a vacation. Just relax and enjoy yourself. Relax? Let's recap. 23 hour drive with screaming baby dog poop aroma, and being sardined with a 75 lb dog and her puppies. Total spa vibes. It wasn't that bad. Oh, it gets better. The second we get here, I become the family nanny. Showers, baby, oh, baby meals, baby. Even when they're doing nothing. Guess who gets the baby? Me. You should have said something sooner. I tried, but apparently she only wants me. Convenient, right? Maybe because you're good with kids. I'm good with kids because I don't get tossed at them like a football every five minutes. Babe, you can't just stay locked in The room. Watch me. If I step out, I'll be holding the baby before I hit the hallway. It's like she has a radar for me. Come on, don't ruin the trip. Let's just go to dinner. Dinner? You mean where I'll hold the baby while her parents eat peacefully and she spills juice on me again? Pass. Babe, you're being dramatic. Dramatic? I've had enough of being an unpaid nanny. I'm one baby toss away from faking food poisoning. Don't test me. You're seriously going to waste the whole trip over this? Waste the trip? I'm already trapped in babysitter hell. This is self preservation at this point. Fine, stay here, but you're missing out. Missing out? Unless dinner involves someone else holding the baby, I'm good. Enjoy.

Once they steal the cash from your mom's bedroom, they will then give her a super strong sleeping pill. This will knock her out cold for around 30 hours and will also wipe her memories so she forgets anything ever happened. I will pay you $2,000 for your role in the robbery. Three thousand will go to the robbers that helped and I get the rest and we all live happily ever after. What the? I'm down.

Who is this? It's Ethan from school. You gave your number out in class. Oh, yeah. Hello, Ethan. Why are you texting me on a Sunday? Is something wrong? No, I was just wondering if you're friends with my neighbours. Why would you think that? I saw you going into my neighbour's house a minutes ago. Wait, is your neighbour Billy Madison? Yeah, that's him. He sold his house to me. So who was that guy with you? That's my husband. Oh, okay. Hey, missus star. I'm sort of struggling with the stuff you taught in class today. Anything specific you want me to go over? I'm not sure. I don't understand any of it. Well, it looks like you might benefit from us being neighbours. What do you mean? Why don't I come over tonight and give you a private lesson? Wow, slow down, missus star. Don't you think we're moving too fast? That's not what I mean, Ethan. And besides, I see the way you stare at me in class. If I was really coming over to do that, you'd never turn me down. Okay, so when are you coming over? Tonight at seven. I'll bring the textbooks. Hey, Ethan. What's up, Mrs. Star? Did our private lesson help at all? A little. Well, it would have helped a whole lot more if you stopped staring at my melons. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, really? So you don't like my melons? No, No, that's not it. I think they're great. How would you know if you've never looked at them? Okay, fine, I was staring at them, but it's not my fault they were basically in my face the whole time. Can't argue with that logic. Remember, we have a test coming up this Friday. I expect you to pass, since I gave you a private lesson. I don't think I will, missus star. Why not? Ethan, I don't have any motivation to study. You're going out with Layla, right? Why don't you get her to help you? She broke up with me yesterday. Really? You guys seem so perfect for each other. Yeah. She left me for Tyler, and honestly, it's making me too sad to study. Tyler? The football captain? Yeah, that's him. I can see why. He's a total hunk. Thanks for making me feel worse. Sorry. If you felt better, would you be more motivated to study? Obviously. Okay, then. What about a prize for getting an A on the test? What kind of prize? A hot picture of me. Just for you, Ethan. Really? Yep. So not even your husband would see it? Nope. Deal. Hey, Mrs. Starr, have you marked the test yet? I have, and you got an A. Congratulations, Ethan. Thanks. So, uh, did you forget? Forget what? The picture. Oh, right. When my husband leaves for work, I'll take the pic and send it. Okay. I just saw him leave for work. Mrs. Starr, he just left. Wait a minute, Ethan. Okay. Glad you like it. Yeah, but I wish it showed the melons. Maybe next time. One more thing. Would you mind coming over for a private lesson tonight? My husband's going away for the whole weekend. Why don't you come over to my place in an hour instead? I don't wanna be alone all weekend. I'll be there. Comment for part three.

I finally saved enough. I just transferred the last bit into my savings account. I'm getting the robotic arm! You don't know how long I've been waiting for this. I'm literally shaking. I can't believe I'll finally be able to feel what it's like to have an arm. Oh, sweetheart. Yeah, about that. What? I had to use the money. What do you mean? I took it. All of it. I went shopping yesterday, bought a whole new wardrobe. Even got a VIP salon package. Don't I deserve to look good? Mom, no. No, you didn't. Oh, I did. And let me tell you, it was the best money I ever spent. You should have seen the sales girl's face when I handed over that stack of cash. Today's the day, Alex. Finally time for your new arm. Since the accident. About that. My mom stole all my money. I can't get the arm anymore. Rizz app help me rizz her up. Rizz app tells me to say, I might not have the bionic arm, but at least I have a beautiful girl like you. I might not have the bionic arm, but at least I have a beautiful girl like you. That's so sweet, Alex. Thank you. Mom, that money was for my arm. You knew that. I've been saving for 5 years. I skipped meals. I sold my old games. I've been dreaming of this every day. Yeah, well, dreams are for suckers. Welcome! To the real world, kid. Money is meant to be spent on things that make you happy. And nothing makes me happier than looking better than everyone else at the country club. You stole it. You've ruined everything. I don't even know what to say. You're so dramatic. Ruined? Please act like you're hurt. It's just an arm. You've survived this long without it, haven't you? What's a few more decades? It wasn't just an arm. It was hope. It was me finally being able to do things I can't do now. It was my future. Your future? Ha ha ha ha ha! Honey, you were never going anywhere anyway. I mean, look at you. You're pathetic. Limping through life thinking some metal arm would magically fix everything. Grow up. How could you? I'm your son. Exactly. My son. Which means what's yours is mine. That money was never really yours. I trusted you. Well, that's your first mistake. Trust gets you nowhere. Look, I'm busy. I've got a date tonight with a guy who actually matters. Don't text me whining about your little pity party. I'm blocking you until you stop being a burden. And I expect another 400 for this month's rent. Mom, please. Please don't do this. I don't know how I'm going to get that money back. I can't start over. Not my problem. Maybe try begging in the streets. Comment part 2 to see the sun get revenge.

I'm half Korean but look completely white. Nobody ever expects me to speak Korean, which has given me some interesting advantages over the years. Last month, I was at this trendy ramen place downtown with my friend Stella. We got seated near the window and two minutes later, three Korean guys sat down right behind us. College students with designer clothes and expensive watches. Total trust fund kid vibes. Stella launched into her dating drama about her ex texting her at 3:00am. I was nodding along when I heard one guy behind us say in Korean, check out that blonde girl in front of us. She, he's actually really pretty. I kept eating my ramen acting clueless. My mom made sure I was lewent growing up, but I've Learned it's better to let people think I don't understand. You learn a lot when they think you can't hear them. His friend responded, yeah, she's hot but probably has zero personality. Look how she's dressed. Probably spends her whole paycheck on clothes. I was wearing a target dress and drugstore mascara. But okay. The third guy laugh. White girls like that are all the same. No substance, just Instagram and shopping. But she's never read a book. I have a master's degree in literature. But sure, Stella was still talking about her ex, completely oblivious to the commentary happening behind us. These guys were getting more obnoxious by the Minute. Look at her trying to use chopsticks, the first guy said, giggling. She's holding them like a kindergartner. This is painful to watch. His friends burst out laughing. Should we go help? We could play the hell of Korean guys teaching the clueless white girl how to eat properly. She'd probably be so grateful for our cultural expertise. Another added, they started planning this elaborate scheme to come over and rescue me from my terrible chopstick technique, then use it to hit on me. The condescension was unreal. Stella finished her story and asked what I thought. I told her to block her ex while these guys kept potting behind us. I bet she doesn't even know what miso is, one said. White girls love that exotic Asian guy thing. This will be easy. We could totally impress her with our food knowledge. Another added, I was getting more annoyed by the second but decided to wait and see how far they'd take this ridiculous plan. They kept going on about how grateful I'd be for their help. She'll probably ask for our numbers after one last. We'll be like her Asian food heroes. The whole thing was so cringe, I almost wanted to turn around and end it right there. But I knew waiting would make the payoff even better. About 10 minutes later, they finished their ramen and got up. I could feel them approaching behind me, probably pumping themselves up for their big rescue mission. The First guy tapped my shoulder and said in English with this exaggerated hell tone, excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, but I noticed you might be having trouble with your chopsticks. Would you like me to show you an easier way? His friends stood behind him, trying not to smirk. They probably thought they were so smooth. I looked up with my best confused expression.

Hi. Is this Ben? This is, who is this? Ben? What's up, dude? How are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Are you serious? I am serious. Am I on the radio right now? Maybe. I don't know. Hi, Ben. Hi. Why are you guys calling me? Good question. Well, I'm calling you because somebody emailed us to do a second date update on you. Uh, I, I don't know what a second date update is. I guess you don't. No, no. You miss it. I, you sound like you listen to the show, but you, we do that a lot. You never heard it? I'm a fan of like the prank phone calls. Those are hilarious. Okay. But I don't think I've heard of the date thing. Well, the date thing is called a second date update. So you went on a date with somebody and now you're not calling them back, basically. Oh, yeah. I think I may have heard of this before or heard one of these. Okay. Well, now you're the star of one Ben. Yay, Ben. It's your time to shine. Oh, man, I can't. Haha. So do you know who might want to get in touch with you? Um, no, I don't have any idea really. What about with a coworker of yours named Dana? Oh, man. Do you know who we're talking about? Oh, yes, I do know. Yes, I now know what you're talking about. Okay. Yeah, that was an interesting night. So wait, you knew that it was a date? Did you know it was a date? I thought that it was a really awkward time, to be honest with you. What were you thinking when you were, I mean, you got there and nobody else was showing up. It was just you and her? Yeah, I got there and no one else was there. And she said that everybody cancelled. And I could just tell the way that she said that, that not everybody cancelled and that she had just kind of lied to get me there. Oh, so you knew, you knew it was a setup by her at that moment? Yeah, I, it was kind of obvious. Like there was a table for two waiting for us. And just the way that she, I didn't think about that. Yeah. Yeah. The way that she said that the people canceled, I could tell that it wasn't real. Like not, not everybody's gonna cancel. And so I, it kind of was just painfully obvious that we were now sort of on like a first date. Yeah. But you, I mean, you would exchange numbers with this girl. You said that she was nice and that maybe kind of attractive. The thing is, if she would have just text me and asked me out, I would have gone out. But I felt so weird that I was tricked. And then all I'm thinking about is Like she lied to get me here. What else is she capable of? It's kind of crazy, you know, I just felt it just totally threw me off. I mean, at one moment she said that she thought you ditched her at the restaurant because you left like you got up to go to the bathroom and then you went outside. Yeah, one point it was really awkward so I didn't know what to say and I was kind of angry that I got duped. So I ate my sushi just really fast cause we weren't talking and she still had a whole plate of it. And I so I said, hold on, I'm just gonna go to the bathroom and just excuse myself and then went in the bathroom and like put cold water on my face and thought about like what is going on? And then I kind of walked out of the restaurant and I didn't even say goodbye to her. I just was like I said I was a little mad and I got outside, I was gonna take a cab home and I realized I forgot my wallet and I was like, oh my gosh. And I don't know what else to do. I didn't want to walk home. So I just walked back into the restaurant and I told her that I had had an emergency and I had to take a call and it it was fine and but now I'm back but I forgot my wallet. I don't know. It was just, I was trying to put the whole thing out of its misery. It just felt so awkward. And I thought that she would want that, too. But. So you came back to the restaurant just because you needed a ride home. You didn't have a change of heart? Really? Kind of embarrassingly, yes. That's the only. Oh, my God. So the emergency phone call and all of that was a lie. You just couldn't escape like you wanted to. Your escape route was ruined. It was excruciating. I had to escape, but. Right. And then I failed at escaping and had to call back. Pathetically, man, that's a lot of lies built into this one outing for you. Since we're getting all of our lies out in the open, I have to let you know that I lied. And she's actually on the other line listening and wants to talk to you. Are you serious? Yes, I am. Hi, Ben. Oh, my gosh. Um.

My Uncle Rusty was always the fun uncle who'd entertain all the kids. He was this larger than life guy who could do magic tricks and always had candy in his pockets. All the neighborhood kids loved him. He wasn't married and didn't have kids of his own, so he'd basically adopt all of us for the day. One particular barbecue stands out because of what happened with my little cousin Aria. She was maybe four at the time and super shy around everyone except me. She followed me everywhere that day, which was kind of annoying because I was trying to hang out with the older kids. So Uncle Rusty announces he's gonna do this new magic trick and all the kids gather around. I remember being super excited because his tricks were always amazing. He asks for a volunteer and picks Arya. Surprised me because she was so shy, but she went up all excited. The trick was supposed to be him making a quarter disappear and then pulling it out of her ear. Pretty standard stuff. But what happened next is the funny story my family cannot stop telling. When Uncle Rusty reached toward Aria's ear, she freaked out, like, full on screaming, crying, trying to run away. My aunt had to come grab her while everyone was laughing because they thought she was just being dramatic. Uncle Rusty played it up, acting All offended, which made all the adults laugh even harder. The next part is what my family thinks is hilarious. Uncle Rusty decided to get revenge on Arya for ruining his trick. Every time she'd calm down, he'd slowly approach her with a quarter, and she'd start screaming again. This went on all day. By the end of the barbecue, he just had to pull a quarter from his pocket and hold it up, and she burst into tears. My parents, aunts, uncles, they were literally crying from laughing so hard. They kept saying how funny it was that she was so scared of something so harmless. This became Uncle Rusty's bit with Aria. At every family gathering after that, he'd pull out a quarter and wave it at her, and everyone would crack up when she'd get upset. I remember one Thanksgiving when I was about 12, Aria was hiding under the dining room table before dinner. I crawled under there to see what was up, and she whispered that she was hiding from Uncle Rusty because she knew he'd do the quarter thing again. She was literally shaking, and I remember thinking it was kind of weird how scared she still was. I told her she was being a baby, which makes me feel terrible now. At Christmas that same year, Uncle Rusty took it to another level. He wrapped a small box for Aria, and when she opened it, there were, like, 50 quarters inside. She dropped The box! And ran crying from the room while all the adults howled with laughter. My mom still brings this up as the funniest Christmas moment ever. When Aria turned 10, her parents threw her this big birthday party with a magician. As soon as the magician started pulling coins out for tricks, Aria had a complete meltdown. Everyone thought it was so funny that she was still doing this bit. The magician was confused, but Uncle Rusty filled him in, and even he started incorporating quarters into all his tricks specifically to scare Aria. A grown adult professional deliberately terrifying a child on her birthday. And everyone thought it was comedy gold. I was too young to really process it then, but looking back now, I'm like, we were literally traumatizing this little girl for years and treating it like a hilarious joke, and the adults were encouraging it. The story got darker when I was home last month helping my mom clean out some old photo albums. We found pictures from those barbecues, and there was one of Aria crying while Uncle Rusty held a quarter near her. My mom was like, Omg, remember how funny that was? And I just couldn't laugh. I asked mom if she ever wondered why Aria was so terrified that first time, and mom just shrugged and said, kids are weird. But I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I called Aria. We're not super close, but we follow each other on Social media. I asked her if she remembered the quarter trick and if she knew why she was so scared. There was this long pause on the phone. Then she told me something that made my stomach

Mine are all messed up. Sure. They're in my closet. Riley, why is there a huge coffee stain on those leggings I let you borrow two days ago? Oh, my god, that's horrible. I don't know how that could have happened. Sucks for you, though. Just don't make this longer than it has to be, okay? I'm sorry. It was an accident. I'm so sick of you borrowing my things and messing them up. Kylie, you're my big sister. This is part of the job description, honey. Kylie, can I use your laptop to play this game that all my friends are playing together? Go ahead. I love you. Um, Kylie, I kind of messed up. You'll see when you get home. What now? Riley? Why is my laptop not turning on? I was drinking water, and then I swear to god, I felt something push me in my back. It spilt all over the laptop. I'm so sorry, Kylie. I tried wiping it down and everything. Well, there's $900 down the drain. It's okay, Riley. You're the golden girl who can do no wrong. That's what mom would say, right? Are you mad? No, I'm just ecstatic. What do you think? Riley? Riley, what have you done to my makeup? Oh, yeah, I was going to tell you about that. I had a little accident. A little accident? You ruined everything! I'm sorry, Kylie. I didn't mean to. One thing just Broke. And then everything else followed. You need to be taught a lesson, Riley. I've had enough. Mom, Riley just destroyed $500 worth of my makeup and ruined the bathroom sink in the process. How bad is it? What is wrong with you? Kylie, I'm genuinely interested to see how you're going to flip this onto me. She might be 15, but I wasn't doing things like this at her age. Why on earth would you spend that much money on makeup? That mess is fixable. But you wouldn't have been this angry if it wasn't so expensive. And for what? To paint your face? You know what? I'm not even going to engage in this. Kylie, why is your door locked? Because I'm out. And I don't want you to go in there and cause World War 3. That makeup thing was the last straw. Riley, you know I love you, but this is unacceptable. We're family. We have to share with each other. You're my big sister. I tried to do the right thing. From now on, if you want to use my things, you're going to have to pay me. Pay you with what money? I don't have a job. Figure it out. I'm telling Mommy. Of course you are. Kylie, why are you acting like this toward your little sister? I tried doing it the nice way, mom. It didn't work. Well, when you come back, your things are going to be packed in a suitcase. What? If you two can't live with each other, then it's way easier for you to move out rather than her. You're 19 now anyway. It's about time. I'm sorry, honey. This is the only way. No, it's not. You better lock your sweet Riley in a room or something, because it won't be pretty when I see that little brat.

I'm Facetiming Logan, and I can't even hear him over you gaming. Okay, I'll be more quiet, but on one condition. If you stop making all those freaky sounds with him over Facetime. I can hear them, you know, it's just weird, Kyle. I mean, I'm willing to, like, turn a blind eye and not tell mom, but you have to promise that you won't bring Logan over when I'm here. That little chode pisses me the hell off. That's not fair. You're always home. Well, too bad. Guess Mom's finding out about your mysterious sounds at three in the morning. Wait. Okay, fine. But why don't you like him? He just gives off a bad vibe. I can just feel that he's hiding something. And he's constantly on my tip bro. Always hating, thinking he's better than me. Can you stop dissing my boyfriend? I will come over there and beat you right now if you keep pissing me off. Rizz AP says the only beating that's going on is you beating your bean. The only beating that's going on is you beating your bean, Kyle. I'll be quiet. Just stop whimpering, please. Good night. Haley, I have to tell you something really important. No, you don't. You never do. No, I'm being serious right now. I saw Logan with another girl at this party last night. Well, then it's not Logan. Logan's a senior, and you're a freshman. What? Would a senior be doing at a freshman party? Yeah, I know. That's the weird part. The girl he was talking to was a freshman. But it was 100% Logan. I'm sure of it. Like my personal beef with him aside, I don't think you should trust him anymore, Haley. And why would I choose to listen to you? I still trust Logan and he still loves me. What ever. Just know when he cheats on you. Or worse, don't come back apologizing for not believing me. Not happening, because he would never cheat on me. Haley, you have to break up with Logan right now. I already told you, I'm not listening to you. I don't care who you saw doing what. Haley, just listen for once. Remember the party that I saw Logan and the freshman at? You mean fake Logan? Yeah, I wanted to believe that too, but after today I'm 100% sure it's Logan. And why is that? I just saw the both of them at a cafe on like a date. Then when I made eye contact with Logan, he immediately got up and pretended he didn't know the freshman that he was talking to. If it wasn't the real Logan, why would he be scared of some random guy looking at him quickly? Maybe the guy just didn't wanna be seen talking to a freshman. I know Logan. He wouldn't do that. Oh yeah? Text him right now and ask him where he is. Alright, I will. Did you just text him? Five seconds ago? Yeah. How'd you know? I just saw him pull out his phone in the cafe. It's him. Haley, I'm sorry, but I did warn you earlier. It's probably just a coincidence. He just texted me that he was still at his house. Do you have his location? No. God, you're so naive, Haley. Kyle, what the hell did you do? I'm protecting you, that's what I'm doing. Logan just texted me that he's in the hospital and that a bunch of freshman boys jumped him so he couldn't hold off a few. Freshman? What? A baby O'mao. He said it was your friends. Kyle, this is too far. No, it isn't. I'm just trying to keep you safe from that absolute dirt bag. Don't talk to me again, Kyle. Why are you always trying to ruin my life? You'll see soon enough. Kyle, did the freshman that Logan was with have green eyes and wavy black hair? Yeah, her name is Rebecca. She also always wears this hoodie, I think. I can't remember how it looks like. Was it red? Yeah, that was it. It was a blank red hoodie. I'm sorry, Kyle.

You're out drinking with the boys, right? Staying at a buddy's place if it gets late. You're so smart. Babe, we've got a work dinner thing tonight. I know. Don't wait up for me, okay?

You always used to plan ahead. Why nothing for my birthday this year? You never liked the gifts I got before, right? Figured cash would be better. Money is what matters anyway. Better to focus on making more dollar than stressing over gifts. You've grown up. I knew you were the best. I'll be home early tonight, babe. Heading home now. I had a bit too much feeling dizzy. I'm home. Babe. You're not here. Where'd you go? Still at work. Overtime, tons to do. Deadline tomorrow. Go to bed. I'll be back when I'm done. Babe, my head's killing me. Okay, noted. Did you hear me? My head hurts. Can't talk. Busy. We'll discuss when I'm back. Changed? You don't care about me at all anymore. So cold and distant. Nothing like when we first met. I go out now. No calls, no texts. Let me ask you. Isn't this what you wanted? Not prying, giving you space. This is what you told me before. I'm doing it now. Isn't that enough? What more do you want? Why are you unhappy now? You've got it all wrong, babe. This isn't what I wanted. I want you to be your old self again. The girl who only had eyes for me.

So beautiful that I was too scared to even go near her. That's the issue. She's perfect in every way. But I have fallen for someone else. Someone who I do speak to. Someone who understands me. Someone without a name or a face, but someone who loves me. The day you find out who I am, I Hope we will be together. Me too. Mystery girl. Can I confess something to you? Sure. What's up? I think it's time to tell you who I am. You can now check part two by pressing share. Then more.

Yesterday, my phone rang at 2:00am. It was the police. Ma'am, we have your six year old son, Tommy at the station. He walked here by himself, saying his mommy heard his baby sister. I shot out of bed. What? Tommy's in his room sleeping. And I don't have a baby sister. Ma'am, please come down to the station immediately. I ran to Tommy's room. Empty bed, front door wide open. At the police station, Tommy was wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The moment he saw me, he screamed, don't let her take me! She killed my sister. My heart stopped. The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room, while Tommy saw bobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. I spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. His little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. The psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy Story never changed. Hours passed. The detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She showed me the room. She made All pink and pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us? But before I could answer,

Your mom called me asking if I knew where you were. I told her you were in my house, in the bathroom, just to cover for you. But seriously, where are you? It's been a day now. Elio. Your mom's freaking out, and honestly, so am I. She called the police. I haven't told them that I lied for you. I keep telling her you're here, but I have no idea where you are. Please come home. I'm getting really worried. I asked my favorite astrology app, Astro App, for advice and it said that I'm a cancer, so I can get really emotional when I feel abandoned. It told me to take deep breaths and focus on grounding myself so I can stay calm and clear minded while waiting to hear from you. Elio, it's been a week. Everyone saying you're missing. Like actually missing. Your mom's been crying non stop and they filed a police report. Where are you? What's going on, Ello? It's been a month now. They still can't find you. I don't even know what to tell people anymore. I got a cat to help with the loneliness, I guess. I named him Charlie. Figured you'd like that. Wish you could see him. She's really sweet. Sleeps with me every night. She and was born on Valentine's Day too. Hahaha. It's been two months since you disappeared. I stopped writing to you because it felt like screaming into the void. Your mom's pregnant. Can You believe that? Guess there'll be another Elio around soon. I miss you so much, Elio. 10 months now. Your sister's almost here. Her name is going to be Julia. I keep hoping you'll walk through the door before she's born. Ello, it's been two years. I know that sounds insane, but part of me still thinks you're coming back. I can't move on from this. Everyone tells me to, but I can't. It's like a piece of me went missing with you. Hey. I need to tell you this. I'm getting married. I found someone who loves me. I think you'd like him. He's the love of my life. And I'm finally getting married. I asked for star rings so you'd be here with me in some way. I miss you more than ever right now. Ilio. It's been five years. I don't know what to say anymore. But I'm still here. They closed your case, the police. No one's looking for you anymore. But I'll never stop. I'm thinking of searching for you on my own. But in secret. Oh, and I'm pregnant. It's a boy. I'm naming him Ilio, after you. Hey. Wow. I didn't even realise we're still having this conversation. It's been seven years. My son's been born. Look. I think he looks a bit like you. He's as cute as you were. Or maybe that's just me imagining things. Wish you could see him. Hey, Ellio. It's been 11 years. He's turning four today. Time flies, doesn't it? Feels like yesterday when I last saw you. He really admires you, you know. I always tell him how great you were as a boyfriend. He says you're still alive, that we're so connected. That's why I feel like you're still around. But I don't know. Sometimes I lose faith in you coming back. I wonder if he's right. I still feel you somehow. Ello. It's been 14 years. My new boyfriend tells me I need to move on. Says I'm holding on too tight. But my son, he still believes you're coming back. He's only a kid, but he has more faith than I do by now. It's been 20 years, Elio. Wow. My boy's nine now. He's getting so big. And guess what? I'm pregnant again. With a girl. She's due in four months, and I'm naming her Jula. Like your sister. Speaking of, your sister moved back in with your parents. She's not doing well. She barely speaks to anyone. It's like everything fell apart when you left. Elio, it's been 25 years. I built the house we dreamed of. Remember that? I also got divorced, though. He cheated on me. Now it's just me, Elio, Julia and the cat. Still waiting for you, I guess. I miss you more than I can put into words, Elio. You have no idea. Every single day. Bria. The fuck you mean? I

And he's just short by a tiny bit. How much is he short? Only 48 thousand dollars. I already told him we'd help. We have plenty of money anyway. A 50 thousand dollar car and he's short forty eight thousand dollars? Is this some kind of joke? Why don't I just buy him the whole car then? Yes, yes. You're the best husband ever. Quick, give me the money! Hold on, he makes $200 a month. How's he going to maintain it? Gas, insurance, repairs. Besides, our own car only cost $20,000. He absolutely must have a car. He's getting married soon. 50,000 dollar car gives him so much face. I think when buying cars, you should go straight to the top. Mom, my brother and I already went car shopping and we all agree it's perfect. Hmm. A 50 thousand dollar car. I'm sure it's nice even without seeing it. Hurry up, babe. Give me the money. They need the deposit today. Why am I the one paying? Do you know why I don't let you handle our money anymore? It's precisely to prevent this. When you managed our finances, we were always in the red because you kept funneling money to your family. Now we finally saved a bit and you're pulling this again? You're his brother in law. He's buying a car for his wedding. Such an important event. Just help him out when he has Money later. He'll definitely take care of you. Ha! I'm going to call your brother right now. Call? What for? Hey, brother, your sister's husband here. Got something to discuss with you. What's up, bro? What's going on? So I spotted this great apartment, but I'm short $5,000 on the down payment. Wondering if I could borrow from you. Huh? Don't you already have two apartments? Why buy another one? Look, don't buy it right now. I'm trying to get a car and was planning to borrow $48,000 from you. What? You wanna borrow from me too? And $48,000? I've already paid the deposit on this place. I really don't have extra cash. Are you doing this on purpose? You knew I wanted to buy a car, and now you pull this stunt? Brother, don't get upset. I'm not targeting you. Just trying to understand something. From what you're saying, I should lend you $48,000 without question. But you can't lend me $5,000? Is at the logic here? You've known about my car plans forever. How could I possibly have money to lend you? You won't even lend me $5,000, so why should I lend you $48,000? Isn't that a blatant double standard? Because you're my sister's husband. Oh, so just because I'm your sister's husband, I'm obligated to support you unconditionally? I have zero responsibility toward you. I spent a fortune on our wedding when I married your sister. This isn't even a life or death situation. I'm done. Talking to you. I'll ask my sister directly. All our money is with me. Going to her won't help. Listen to me. You will give this money to my brother. Give me the money now! Amy, listen to yourself. This isn't healthy. You know what's not healthy? Watching my brother struggle while we sit in our comfortable house with money in the bank. I guess I finally see where your priorities lie.

You never do. No, I'm being serious right now. I saw Logan with another girl at this party last night. Well, then it's not Logan. Logan's a senior, and you're a freshman. What? Would a senior be doing at a freshman party? Yeah, I know. That's the weird part. The girl he was talking to was a freshman. But it was 100% Logan. I'm sure of it. Like my personal beef with him aside, I don't think you should trust him anymore, Haley. And why would I choose to listen to you? I still trust Logan and he still loves me. What ever. Just know when he cheats on you. Or worse, don't come back apologizing for not believing me. Not happening, because he would never cheat on me. Haley, you have to break up with Logan right now. I already told you, I'm not listening to you. I don't care who you saw doing what. Haley, just listen for once. Remember the party that I saw Logan and the freshman at? You mean fake Logan? Yeah, I wanted to believe that too, but after today I'm 100% sure it's Logan. And why is that? I just saw the both of them at a cafe on like a date. Then when I made eye contact with Logan, he immediately got up and pretended he didn't know the freshman that he was talking to. If it wasn't the real Logan, why would he be scared of some random guy looking at him quickly? Maybe the guy just didn't wanna be seen talking to a freshman. I know Logan. He wouldn't do that. Oh yeah? Text him right now and ask him where he is. Alright, I will. Did you just text him? Five seconds ago? Yeah. How'd you know? I just saw him pull out his phone in the cafe. It's him. Haley, I'm sorry, but I did warn you earlier. It's probably just a coincidence. He just texted me that he was still at his house. Do you have his location? No. God, you're so naive, Haley. Kyle, what the hell did you do? I'm protecting you, that's what I'm doing. Logan just texted me that he's in the hospital. And then a bunch of freshman boys jumped him so he couldn't hold off a few freshman. What? A baby O'mao. He said it was your friends. Kyle, this is too far. No, it isn't. I'm just trying to keep you safe from that absolute dirt bag. Don't talk to me again, Kyle. Why are you always trying to ruin my life? You'll see soon enough. Kyle, did the freshman that Logan was with have green eyes and wavy black hair? Yeah, her name is Rebecca. She also always wears this hoodie, I think. I can't remember how it looks like. Was it red? Yeah, that was it. It was a blank red hoodie. I'm sorry, Kyle.

When I needed new shoes for cross country, dad said the old ones had plenty of life left. They were held together with duct tape. Rebecca tried to stick up for me sometimes, but dad would just say I needed to learn the value of hard work. Senior year came and I was actually doing pretty well. I'd gotten into three colleges and even landed a small academic scholarship. I was excited to tell him, thinking maybe this would be the thing that made him proud. I found him in the garage working on Tyler's car and told him about the acceptance letters. He nodded and said, that's nice, buddy. Then asked if I could hand him a wrench. That night at dinner, Tyler announced he'd been named team captain for state's freshman squad. Dad literally stood up and clapped. He pulled out his wallet and handed Tyler $200 for Celebration dinner with his girlfriend. I looked at Jess and she rolled her eyes. Even she thought it was too much. The breaking point came three weeks before graduation.

Jess was daddy's little princess who could do no wrong. Meanwhile, I was just a kid who reminded him of his first marriage failure. Every family dinner was Tyler talking about his latest achievements while dad beamed like he'd won the lottery. Jess would show him her art projects, and he'd hang them on the fridge with little heart magnets. When I brought home my honor roll certificate sophomore year, he glanced at it for two seconds and said, good job, sport, without even looking up from his phone. The worst part was how he'd introduce us to people. This is my son, Tyler. He's going to state on a football scholarship. And my daughter, Jess, she's so artistic. Then he'd pause and add, oh, and this is Jake. Just Jake. Like I was some random kid who happened to live there. Money was always tight, but somehow.

Yesterday, my phone rang at 2:00am. It was the police. Ma'am, we have your six year old son, Tommy at the station. He walked here by himself, saying his mommy heard his baby sister. I shot out of bed. What? Tommy's in his room sleeping. And I don't have a baby sister. Ma'am, please come down to the station immediately. I ran to Tommy's room. Empty bed, front door wide open. At the police station, Tommy was wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The moment he saw me, he screamed, don't let her take me. She killed my sister. My heart stopped. The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away, too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room while Tommy sobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My Stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. I spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. His little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. This psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy's story never changed. Hours passed. The detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She showed me the room. She made all Pink and pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us? But before I could answer,

Your message notification can wake up my whole house, let alone just me. Haha yeah, it is a pretty loud one. So can I go on the notes app yet? Not just yet. Have some patience. You can do it when I'm an hour away from home. And how long is that gonna be? Well, for starters, I'm 6 hours out. Oh my god. So long. For what? This better be good. Hopefully you like it. Me? Why would I like it? Oh, I don't know. I mean, just like after the wait. I hope you like it. I see. Well, I never thought I would be texting myself, but I will say this has been pretty fun. Same to you, Adam. Yeah, I was going to complain to the school about getting our phones mixed up, but I guess I'll cut them a break this time. Haha. This time. Hopefully it doesn't happen again.

Okay, is this, like, he has a pretty crazy search history that includes a kinky fetish type thing, or is it worse? No, it's worse. Um, so I was looking at his iPad because it's connected to his phone, and I had to reset our home, like, security system, and he keeps the code on there in his note section. So I was getting the code, and I noticed one of the sections in his note that was called Gift Ideas. So I was like, hmm, maybe I'll take a quick peek, see if he picked up on the many hints that I've been leaving. Um, so wait. So, wait, so you snoop? So you're a Christmas gift snooper, then? For shame. Yeah, I know. I'm a bad person, but, uh, anyway, I was looking, and I see some. Some of the stuff he was thinking about getting the family and friends, and then I see a name, staff.

I mean, it kind of depends, so. Right. I mean, if it's somebody, maybe they're retiring after many years of working with him. Or are the diamonds, like, teeny, tiny cheapos? Listen, but even if they are, I don't know if a married man has any business buying diamond earrings for another woman for any reason. Has he ever bought you diamond earrings? Yeah, but many, many years ago. Okay, but see, he took care of his wife first. Then I don't know. I don't think there's any reason why a married man should be buying diamond earrings for another woman. See, that's exactly how I feel as well. So. Okay, what do you want us to do then, Casey? I like to know who this staff person is and why he's buying her diamond earring. Okay, well, I'm not sure if we can answer the second question, but we can definitely find out the more important one, which. Who is this staff person? And. And I'm assuming we can call your husband? Yes, absolutely. Okay. And what is his name? I don't think you ever told us. It's John. John. Okay, so hang on a sec, and then we'll get John's number from you, and then we will call him when we come back next. Hello? Hi, can I speak To John, please. Can I ask who's calling? Sure. This is the Z Morning Zoo radio show on Z1O4. Nick, Natalie and Shaggy. Is this John? It sure is. What's up, everybody? Not much. How are you this morning? I'm doing well. I'm doing real well, actually. I feel a lot better if you're about to tell me I won something, though. Oh, yeah? Well, I wish that was why you were calling. Actually, we've been doing something really special on our show this week called Sexy Secret Santa, and that's why we called you. Okay, so the way it works is if somebody's got, like, a special person in their lives and they're kind of, like, a secret, they call us and tell us to wish them a very sexy Christmas.

So you remember hanging out with Sean? Yeah, I remember him. It doesn't sound like you fondly remember him. You could say that. Oh. Oh, okay. Okay. He has great memories of you. Really? Yeah. That's why he emailed us. Sean wants to know why you're not calling him back. I think he's a sketchball. Is that a good enough reason? Really? What? No. I mean, we talked to him. I thought he was like dorky at worst, but a nice guy. So he called you? What did he say? Well, I don't wanna tell you cause you sound mad. It wasn't anything bad. I wanna know. I wanna know. What did he say? Well, he said that he met you at some show and you guys were bonding over the great banjo player that they had, and then you went to. Yeah, Then you went to a bar after. Whoa. And he spilled a drink on himself and asked if he could go back to your place to kind of clean his shirt up or something, which we all said had to be an excuse to just get over to your place, but he swore up and down it wasn't. So I guess he didn't mention to you that he's a thief. What? Whoa. A thief? No. Yeah, he's a kleptomaniac. He didn't drop that. What did he drop? Yeah, he didn't tell us that he likes to steal things. Yeah. So, uh, the next morning, I was in my room. He was on the couch. I heard some rustling in the hallway, and it was like, I don't know, like 5:00am or something. And then I heard a door close. So I called out. I was like, Sean? Sean? Hello? No answer. So I got up, walked out of the hallway, I looked around, I checked the couch. He wasn't there. He was gone. But I saw that the closet door in my hallway was open, where I keep my coats and stuff. Okay. And he had put his coat there. Uh huh. So I went over to close it, and his coat was gone. That makes sense, I guess, if he was gone. But then all of my hangers were gone, too. What, all of your. all of my empty hangers that were just hanging in my closet were Gone. What? They were there. They were there before he came. So, yeah, he's a thief. Wait, you're accusing him of stealing coat hangers from your house? I'm not assuming that that happened. I know that happened. He did it. You sound very angry about these hangers being taken. Would you be angry if you invited someone back to your house after a really nice date and then found out that they stole things from you? Yeah. Yeah, I think you'd be. Yeah, but I. I guess. But I don't know why. Hangers just doesn't hit me that hard. Me neither. It's so weird. They're my things. I only just met. We have hung out for, like, a couple hours, and I invited him back to my place. Like, why do you take my hangers? Yeah, it's a really valid question. It makes no sense. It's weird and sketchy and dumb, that is. You didn't notice anything else missing from your house? It was just the hangers. You keep saying my hangers, like it's like it's not a big deal. But he just took them. He didn't leave a note. He didn't say anything about it. He just took my hangers. That is weird, man. Yeah, I guess it is weird. I don't know why you would take hangers. Don't you wanna know why he would take hangers? Don't you know why he would wanna steal your hangers? It's just. No, I don't care why he did it. I don't Care how he tries to excuse himself. He's lucky I didn't call the police. Oh, that would be a call. Yeah, I'd love to see him get arrested for that. Yeah, that's true though, right? I probably. Yeah, you probably could get him arrested. I'm kind of wondering why he would steal your hangers. So I think we should ask him, Juliana, cause he's on the phone listening right now and wants to talk to you.

So put a jar of leeches in there. And when he takes his computer out to show his boss the work, his boss sees the jar of leeches and fires him.

Get to know him and send him frequent selfies of some Instagram model. Now that you got his trust, ask him to send you money to fly you out. He's a SIMP so he'll fall for it. Once he sends it. Block him. Donate this money to a racist charity under his name. Take a screenshot of this and upload it to TikTok so that companies see that he's racist. He can't get a job in business anymore. He's got to work in fast food now and he's probably gonna be a cook since he loves to cook. It's 100% gonna be McDonald's since that's his favourite fast food. So go to his joint and order a 10 piece Mcnugget through the driveway. Once you get the 10 piece, eat three of them and complain to the manager that you didn't get 10. He'll get a warning with this. Do this a few more times across two days, but on Doordash with different names. He gets fired and has a bad reference since he can't even work properly in fast food now. We can't even get a job, so he's homeless. Go up to him with a challenge. Tell him that if he can swallow a spoon of cinnamon in under one minute without water, add on that if he does this, gets $10,000. He's gonna take this offer up since he's homeless. Take your phone out and start recording to make it seem like it's a real YouTube video. Once he puts the cinnamon in his mouth, run for your dear life. Avenge me.

I mean, I'm scared like you. What do you mean? The creeper man. How do you know about that? Because I've seen him too. How do you know I've seen him? Cause I read your blog. I use an alias. I know. I tracked you down using the URL. Are you a hacker or something? Not much to do at night when you're not sleeping. How do I know you're actually seen him? I can describe him. You read my blog. You would already know what he looks like. Tell me the only thing that can make him go away. Light. You turn the light on and what happens? He vanishes. And when you turn it off, he's there again. Watching. Okay. Maybe you've seen him. I see him every night. Me too. When do you sleep? A few hours between the sun comes up and school starts. You? I wear a face mask and keep all the lights on. But lately I haven't slept much. Me either. Do you think there are others like us? You're the only other person I know of. What does he want? Have you ever turned the lights off and pretend to be asleep? Yes. What does he do? I can hear him creeping toward me. Me too. He gets close and I can feel his breath. It's cold. Yes, but then I freak out and turn on the light. What if he wants to tell us something? What if he wants to kill us? I think we should work together. Maybe we can help each other. I've tried recording with my laptop. I can see him on the live feed, but he never shows up on the recording. How does that help us? I can hack into your laptop and watch you while you're sleeping. Who's creepier, you or him? Hear me out. I'll watch him while you sleep and see what he does. You can plug your lamp into a remote that I can access from the web. If he does anything dangerous, I'll turn on the light and he'll disappear. I don't know. You can do the same for me. Watch you? Yes. I can walk a through. That way we'll be like each other's guardian angels. We just have to sleep different times. I'm scared. I am too. But maybe we can figure out what he wants. Okay, I'm in. Hey. What's your name? Kit.

A friend of mine had his buddy house sit for his family and the buddy set up all the Christmas decorations in summer. 2, ash their cigarette on the floor, then got really, really mad when we asked them not to do it again. 3. My aunt, uncle and cousins took a vacation out to my area once and we invited them over for dinner. I hadn't seen them in years, so I didn't know my cousins very well. One of my cousins, upon entering our home, immediately started quietly walking into every room in the house and opening up closets, dresser drawers and cabinets. There wasn't anything he could stumble upon that was embarrassing or valuable and we didn't want to make a scene, so we just kind of let him have the run of the house. My aunt and uncle acted like this was just a normal thing. Later on, I called my mom and asked about that and she said, oh yeah, that kid is super weird. We have to lock all our bedroom doors when he comes over. He tends to just rifle through people's personal lives. He doesn't take anything. He just likes to snoop. 4, a family friend was staying at my house for the week. At the end of the week, my desktop was working really slowly. After a brief look through the history, I noticed Two things. The amount of inappropriate things both viewed and downloaded was ridiculous. I didn't know how to react in the moment. But on the drive to his home, I had to let him know that he was definitely banned from using my desktop after that. 5, I had an extra ticket for a chef hosted pop up dinner with cocktails and wine included. I called a buddy who's a chef knowing he'd appreciate it. We started hitting the drinks hard but he was lapping me and he got very drunk. We went to two bars after. Neither would serve him. So I said let's walk to my house and sleep it off. We had a few at the house and I went to bed. I woke up in the morning and he was gone but had left a kind note on the counter. I found another note in the coffee maker and another in the cups. We kept finding notes of love and gratitude hidden all over the house for weeks after. It was really sweet. 6, I had a friend take an hour long dump in my bathroom once. When he finally came out, I asked if he was okay. He sheepishly said, yeah, sorry, I had some cleaning up to do. When I asked what that meant, he said, well, I went in to just pee but then decided to try to squeeze out a fart but it backfired and went all over your wall. I've spent The last hour cleaning the poop off the stucco. Seven let their child get red sauce all over my furniture, then turned and told me that 1, I shouldn't have had red sauce pasta as an option for dinner at my home. And 2, they saved me because my child was going to ruin my furniture at some point anyway. I was pregnant at the time. 8, brought their dog without notice and expected us to get rid of our cats out of courtesy for their dog who hates cats and wants to attack them. They also went through our house to sneak a peek at the rooms and rummage through our drawers and closet, too. I have quite the in laws.

I was 16 when my brother Jeremiah burst through our door at 2:00am. Blood on his Lakers Jersey and terror in his eyes. Those same eyes that used to light up when I'd sneak him extra cookies from Mom's jar. Same brother who taught me to ride a bike in the cracked parking lot behind our building. He joined a gang in our neighborhood three months earlier, not because he wanted to, but because when you're 15 in our neighborhood and they decide you're useful, saying no isn't really an option. Dad made sure of that, using Jeremiah to pay off his own debts to the gang. Mom was in the kitchen making tamales for her dog shelter fundraiser when they kicked in the door behind Jeremiah. Three men with tattoos crawling up their necks, the leader holding a gun that looked too big for his hand. You thought you could just walk away, little homie? He said to Jeremiah, who was shaking so hard I could hear his teeth chattering. Mom dropped her bowl flower exploding across her favorite apron. Everyone was terrified. One of the gang members grabbed mom by her hair, dragging her to the living room, where I was frozen on the couch. I remember almost peeing myself, looking to my brother to stop whatever this was. Here's how this works, Nico said, pressing the firearm into Jeremiah's back. You tried to ghost us, thinking you could Just go back to being a regular kid. But blood in, blood out, remember? Jeremiah could barely talk. He knew he'd made a huge mistake coming home. Please, I just wanted to finish school. I didn't mean no disrespect. He just laughed, telling him it was too late. Pick one. Your sister or your mama. You got 60 seconds. The entire room was silent as we all processed what he meant. Then mom immediately started pleading. Take me, baby. Take me. Daniela has her whole life ahead of her. She's going to college. She's going to be a doctor. They pointed it at me, but I started screaming over her. No, Jeremiah, pick me. Mom has the shelter. All those dogs need her. The neighborhood needs her. I'm nobody. Just pick me. Jeremiah was sobbing now, looking back and forth with tears and snot on his face. I can't. I can't do this. Please don't make me do this. They pressed it harder into his side. 50 seconds. Mom was on her knees, still in her flower covered apron, reaching for Jeremiah. Baby, look at me. It's okay. I've lived my life. I've loved you both more than air. Let me go. Knowing Daniela will live. But I couldn't let my sweet mama do this. People needed her. I wanted it to be me. She's lying, Jeremiah. Think about all the dogs at the shelter. Think about the kids she's kept off the streets. The other gang members were laughing. Making bets on who he choose, Jeremiah kept saying, I'm sorry over and over. They counted down 30 seconds, 20. Mom and I were both crying, both begging him to choose the other. And I could see something breaking in Jeremiah's eyes, something that would never be whole again. At 10 seconds, Jeremiah finally turned toward me, his hands studying as tears streamed down his face. I'm sorry, Danny, he whispered. Mom's right. You're going to be something special. I closed my eyes, hearing mom scream, no! He choked.

I was given a built in boyfriend thief when my younger sister, Ashley was born. And I'm not talking about borrowed hoodies or flirty glances. I mean it. Like, if I brought home a boyfriend, she'd have him in her bed within a month. If I introduce someone at dinner, she'd already be texting him under the table. If I posted an anniversary photo, she'd somehow end up accidentally running into him at his gym. People said she got mom's looks and I got Dad's personality. It started very small, almost innocent, even. when my high school boyfriend suddenly wanted to study at our house all the time, Ashley would walk by in towels, asking him for homework help. I didn't see it then, since I trusted them both, but by the time we hit our 20s, it got calculated. I dated Shane for six months before introducing him to my family. One week after that dinner, Ashley had a crisis and needed his shoulder to cry on at 2:00am. They slept together that night. Next came Julio from my accounting firm. The pattern repeated. Family dinner, sudden emergency, midnight comfort. When I confronted her after finding their texts, she tilted her head and smiled. I'm just making sure they're good enough for you. Julio failed the test. And honestly, I agreed. If they would leave me for my sister, they Weren't the right one for me. Then came Seth, who I dated for two years. We talked about getting married after I finished my teaching degree. Ashley got too drunk at the birthday party I'd thrown him and kissed him in front of everyone. When he chose her, she posted, sometimes you can't help who you fall for. Sorry. Not sorry. Mom pulled me aside at Thanksgiving, voice sharp. You need to stop bringing these men around. Ashley can't control herself when you parade them in front of her. Why do you keep tempting her? In my head, I hadn't tempted anyone. Three months later, I met Adam at a friend's wedding down in Portland. He was everything kind, successful, and apparently loyal. For eight months, I kept him completely secret. We dated in different towns, avoided social media, and told absolutely no one. I thought I'd finally won because this was the best relationship I had ever been in. Till my cousin accidentally mentioned him to mom, who mentioned him to Ashley. She found him within days through his company website. I walked into his apartment with the key he'd given me and found them together in our bed. But the worst part came when Ashley sat up, still naked, and said, I did you a favor. He barely lasted 10 minutes. You deserve better, sis. Adam just shrugged. Your sister is way too hot for me not to try. I stood there shaking while she gathered her clothes. Kissing him goodbye like I wasn't even there. That's when I decided to give Ashley exactly what she craved. A man she couldn't resist, but definitely should. I spent weeks searching through court records and police databases. That's how I found Wayne, a gorgeous, charming man who claimed to be a venture capitalist from Boston, recently divorced after his ex wife documented years of financial and physical abuse. Two restraining orders from other exes. Under investigation for fraud. Court documents showed he'd hidden assets, forged signatures, and manipulated multiple women into debt. Perfect. I created a fake LinkedIn profile as a potential investor and reached out to him. We met for Business Coffee, where I mentioned my beautiful sister who always stole my boyfriend's and showed him her Instagram. Said that I could never find love. His eyes lit up at the ability to control me because no one gave me a chance. Very quickly, things progressed, and I told him I was trying to keep my new relationship secret from her and invited him as my date to Mom's birthday dinner, knowing exactly what would happen. He thought he was playing me, and I would be his next new victim. And at first, he played it.

My husband and I adopted our daughter, Zoe, when she was six years old. She'd been in the foster system for three years after being removed from a severely neglectful home. Zoe had been placed with three different families before us, but each time, the adoptive parents sent her back to foster care when her behavioural issues became too difficult to handle. Zoe's first day with us seemed to go well. She was quiet but polite, said thank you for everything, and didn't cause any trouble. That night, we showed her to her new bedroom. We'd spent weeks decorating it. Pink walls, stuffed animals, and a comfortable bed with soft blankets. This is your room, Zoe. Everything here is yours. She nodded and whispered thank you. We tucked her in, read her a bedtime story, and said good night. But around 2:00am, I woke up and decided to check on her. Her bedroom was empty. I found her in the kitchen, pulled up on the floor behind the refrigerator, wide awake. Zoe, sweetie, what are you doing down here? She looked terrified. I'm sorry. I'll go back upstairs. Why are you sleeping on the floor? This is where I'm supposed to sleep. My heart broke. Honey, you have a beautiful bed upstairs. That's your bed. But I was bad today. Bad? You weren't bad at all. I spilled water at dinner, and I forgot to say Thank you. When you gave me the towel. Zoe, those aren't bad things. Those are just normal things that happen. In my old house, when I was bad, I had to sleep on the kitchen floor. I started crying. This little girl thought she was being punished and had put herself in time out on our kitchen floor. This went on for two weeks. Every night she would sneak downstairs to sleep on the kitchen floor. The breakthrough came when our social worker suggested we ask Zoe what would make her feel safe in her bed. I don't know, Zoe said quietly. I've never had a bed that was really mine. What do you mean? In my old house, I slept on the couch, but if Mommy's boyfriend was mad, I had to sleep on the floor. In foster homes, they said the bed was mine, but then I'd have to leave. That's when I understood. She was afraid of getting attached to something that might be taken away. Zoe, would it help if we wrote your name on something so you know it's really yours? Her eyes lit up, like with a marker. I handed her a permanent marker. Write your name anywhere you want. Zoe carefully wrote. Zoe on the headboard of her bed, then on her dresser, then on the wall next to her bed. That night, for the first time, Zoe slept in her bed all night. But we weren't done with challenges. A few days, Later, I made spaghetti and meatballs. She ate everything, asked for seconds, then thirds. Zoe, you don't have to eat everything right now. There will be more food tomorrow. She looked panicked. But what if there isn't? Zoe was hoarding food because she'd Learned that meals weren't guaranteed. But the biggest shock came in late October. When I mentioned Halloween was coming up. She looked terrified. Halloween? Yes, sweetie, we're going to get you a costume and go trick or treating. She started crying. No, I have to hide. I have to go in the closet.

When I was in 8th grade, we had a science class where we were supposed to be describing the properties of chemicals. We were shown how to waft the hand over a vessel to get a smell, not to taste it, etcetera, and then were given a beaker of liquid to write observations about. We were constantly warned to follow the protocols we were taught. One kid grabbed his beaker, drank it down, and said, it's water. He was immediately kicked out of class. Later that day, I heard the teacher talking about how at the last minute, he decided to use water as the first chemical instead of an acid because of how stupid this one kid would be. He wasn't wrong. 2. I work tech support for copper phone lines. I had an old German sounding lady on the phone saying her phone was electrocuting her while she was holding it, the phone she was talking to me on. I told her to please stop using the phone and that we'd send someone out to see what was going on. This lady just kept screaming about how bad it hurt to hold the phone, how much pain she was in. I was like, just hang up. I don't know what to tell you. But she stayed on the phone in agony until I ended the call. 3. It was me. I Saw a red hot burner and asked my mom what red feels like. She told me not to touch it saying it was very hot and would hurt me badly. I then decided I wanted to see what red felt like. 4. Climbed into a cardboard baler because he threw his phone in and wanted to check after he had already crushed it. I yanked the key out and he was fired immediately. 5. I was chaperoning a field trip where the seventh graders got to shoot compound bows. They were expressly told multiple times to not dry fire the bow, pulling back and letting go without an arrow. One kid literally did that as soon as he was handed a bow and broke it. Luckily these were small and low strength pull back bows so he didn't get hurt, but he sure as heck got benched for the rest of class. 6. Safety video do not stick your hand in liquid molten plastic. Five minutes on the plant floor, my supervisor says to me, hey, take Johnny to the hospital because he stuck his hand in molten plastic and his third degree burns. That was the end of Johnny. I never saw him again. 7. The tech next to me was using canned air to clean a dusty computer. I noticed he was tilting the can to the side really far to get into the fans, so I told him to be careful because if you tilt it too Far it'll spray sub zero temperature liquid that can freeze burn your skin. He said, really? And then immediately turned the can upside down and sprayed directly into his palm. I was just speechless while he clutched his hand and cursed. 8 when I was five years old, my dad poured some sort of strong and relatively toxic deep cleaning liquid on our wooden dinner table to remove a stain. He jokingly told me not to taste it and left the dining room for a moment while the deliciously green liquid was dissolving the stain, I stared at it for a while and proceeded to lick it. 9. I worked in an aquatic store and told a new hire to be careful when working in the coral baths because the halogen lights got stupid hot. This was before LEDs and they were out of the way of customers. I told him not to touch them. As soon as the words left my mouth, he stuck his fingertips on the light. I had to get him to the ER and almost 20 years later I can still hear the sizzle of skin. 10. Picking up a box jellyfish and continuing to hold it the entire time it was stinging him.

I was 15 and applying to Dairy Queen. 3, if someone tried robbing us, how would you protect the cash register? They didn't like my reply of I wouldn't protect it. I thought this was some kind of test, but it wasn't. They actually wanted their employees to put their lives on the line for whatever money was in the cash register at the time. This was a minimum wage job. 4, I was asked to name my favorite color and then defend that choice. I was applying to be the controller of the accounting department. 5, if you needed to eat an elephant, how would you go about it? I guess this question could assess problem solving skills or your approach to seemingly insurmountable tasks. But I could think of better questions for that. I ended up quoting that one Shell Silverstein poem about the girl who wanted to eat a whale and how she ate it one bite at a time. They seem to like that answer. Six, why do you want to work here? It's such a common question and I know they ask it because they want their employees to be enthusiastic about where they work. But in all honesty, I Want to work here because I need a freaking job. 7. If you were a Star Wars character, would you be Luke, Leia Han, R2 or c three Po? I didn't get the job probably because I said Wedge Antilles and went on for quite some time about the strength of being a competent background character who didn't feel the need to be the main character of every story. The interviewers had no idea who wedge was. 8. Not a specific question, but I'm a teacher and I live in New Zealand. We have a law here that if there is a teaching job available, a school has to advertise it and let people apply even if they already have an employee they want to give it to. That includes if someone is working in a fixed term role, usually covering while someone is on extended leave and that role becomes permanent. They can't just give the job to the person who has been doing it. I was fixed term for the first three years of my current job. I've been permanent for the last 4. Each of the three years was a different contract. My school takes the application law very seriously. They made me reapply an interview for the job I was already doing four times. Each time they interviewed me and pretended not to know me and I had to answer the questions like I was a brand new person. Nine if I asked your friend what you Were like in high school, what would they say? I ended the interview right after that 10. Interviewer, give me one good reason why I should give you this job. I replied, give me one good reason why I should accept it. I got the job.

Marry him anyway, my grandmother told me when I showed her the prenup my fiance's lawyer had drawn up. But first become exactly what they think you are. Everyone else said to run. My friends were horrified. My sister called me pathetic. The prenup basically said if we divorced, I'd get nothing. No alimony, no assets, no claim to anything acquired during marriage. Brian came from old money. His family was convinced I was a gold digger, a nurse marrying a tech CEO for his bank account. The prenup was their idea, protecting their precious son from the calculating poor girl. Sign it, grandma said, then go back to school. With what money? His. She was right. The prenup said nothing about education expenses during marriage, thing about him paying for my life while married. It only protected assets and divorce. So I signed it. His family celebrated. His mother actually said, so glad you understand your place. The day after our wedding, I enrolled in law school. Ryan thought it was cute. My little wife wants to be a lawyer. His friends laughed about how I'd never finish. I finished top of my class, law review, passed the bar, first try. His mother sneered at graduation. Such a waste. You'll be having babies soon. Anyway, I started my MBA next. Ryan paid for everything. We were married, shared finances. The prenup couldn't touch that. His family rolled their eyes at family dinners. While I discussed international business law, seven years in, I had a law degree, an MBA and had started a consulting firm with the money Ryan gave me for shopping. Built it from nothing to six figures while being the perfect trophy wife at his events. His family still treated me like trash, still made jokes about the prenup protecting them from me. Ryan started believing them, getting cocky, cheating because what was I going to do, leave with nothing? Year 10, I filed for divorce. Ryan laughed. You get nothing. Remember that prenup you signed? Actually, I said I get everything I built. See, while the prenup protected his pre marriage assets and his income, it said nothing about businesses started during marriage with marital funds. My law degree taught me that. My MBA helped me build it. My consulting firm was worth $2 million. Started with his money? Yes, but legally mine. That's fraud, his mother screamed at mediation. That's marriage. My lawyer, my study partner from law school replied she used marital assets to build her own career. Completely legal. They tried to fight it at $300,000 on lawyers trying to break my business claim. But I documented everything perfectly, every dollar traced, every paper filed correctly. My grandmother's advice that everyone thought was stupid, become exactly what they think you are, then become something they never imagined. I thought I was a gold digger. Fine.

My dad was the cheapest person alive and I proved it on my 16th birthday in the most embarrassing way possible. Growing up, my dad had this golden rule about birthdays. He'd spend exactly fifty dollars per kid, not a penny more. He'd literally set a timer at the store and leave when it hit the fifty dollar Mark, even if he was mid sentence talking to a cashier. My older brother got a calculator and a pack of batteries for his 16th. My sister got a hairbrush set from the dollar store and some lip gloss. When my turn came around, I was expecting the same treatment. But something weird happened the week before my birthday. Dad kept whispering to mom in the kitchen and they'd stop talking whenever I walked in. He even asked me what my favourite colour was, which he'd never done before. I started thinking maybe, just maybe, he was finally going to do something special for my sweet 16. Morning of my birthday, dad woke me up early with this huge grin on his face. Happy birthday, kiddo. I've got something really special for you this year. My heart actually started racing. Maybe he'd gotten me a car or at least a decent phone to replace my cracked hand me down. He LED me to the living room where mom was sitting with the biggest wrapped box I'd ever seen. It was Easily 3 feet tall and covered in shiny paper. Go ahead, dad said tically, bouncing on his feet. Open it. I tore into that wrapping paper like my life depended on it. Underneath was a plain cardboard box, but it was still huge. I opened the flaps, looked inside, and my stomach dropped to the floor. It was filled with exactly 50 one dollar bills, not folded neatly, not in an envelope, just 50 crumpled loose dollar bills scattered around like confetti in a giant box. Surprise, dad yelled, throwing his hands up like he just revealed a new car. I figured this year instead of spending $50 on something you might not want, I'd give you the $50 directly. That way you can buy exactly what you want. I stared at the box of crumpled money while my parents beamed at me like they just solved world hunger. My friends are going to be here in two hours for my party. How was I supposed to explain that my dad's big sweet 16 surprise was loose dollar bills in a cardboard box? Isn't it perfect, mom chimed in. Dad spent hours making sure he had exactly 50 singles from the bank. That's when it hit me. Dad was so proud of this idea that he'd probably tell everyone at my party about his genius gift giving strategy. I could already picture him explaining to my friend's parents how he'd optimized birthday presents. So I decided to optimize right back. I scooped up all 50 bills, walked to my room and came back with my piggy bank. I dumped out every coin I've been saving since I was little, pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, everything. Dad, I announced your gift inspired me. I want to give you something, too. I started counting out coins on the coffee table. One dollar in pennies for being the most creative gift giver. I stacked 100 pennies, $2 and nickels for always teaching me the value of money. I counted out 40 nickels. Dad's smile started fading as I continued. $3 and dimes for showing me that it's the thought that counts. Thirty dimes joined the pile. And finally I said, grabbing my remaining quarters, four dollars and quarters for proving that the best gifts come from the heart. I pushed the pile of coins toward him. There's your ten dollar gift, Dad. 50 cents for every dollar you gave me. I figured you'd appreciate getting your money's worth. Mom's mouth was literally hanging open. Dad stared at the mountain of coins on his coffee table, then at me, then back at the coins.

Oh, no. Alright, so we met online. She's super cute. So I figure, okay, let's go to a bar, let's. Let's talk. So we go to this Irish pub. And you know those dates where it's just like, not right? You know, where, like, you're trying to have conversation, but there's always this awkward silence or long pauses, and you can kind of, like, never get any momentum. Yeah, sounds fun. It was just painful. Uh huh. Alright, so this is happening. I've had this situation before. It's like, there's not chemistry or whatever. So after like 45 minutes, you know, I gave it a good old college try or whatever. We weren't clicking, so I just say like, hey, we can just leave, we can just end the date, and that's okay. And what did she say to that? She seems super relieved. Okay, so there were no hard feelings? You know, we're both adults. Like, it all feels very copacetic or whatever. And then she asks me to walk her to her apartment, which, you know, it's relatively early in the evening, but the sun's down. And so she says she just wants that somebody take her back to her apartment. And that. That makes sense to me. You know, just to be a nice guy, I say, sure, okay. Okay. And we're walking to apartment, and I guess, like, thinking back, like, the conversation started getting a little bit better. You know, like There was a little less tension in the air or whatever as we were walking. So now you're getting along? Yeah. Well, that's the thing. We get to her place and I have no idea why she did this, but she invites me up. What? What? I guess things got a lot better then, right? So you went from let's end the date, this is horribly awkward, to come on up to my place? Yeah, I didn't know what was going on either. In my head I was thinking really? Like, I didn't say that out loud, but I was totally thinking, yeah. So did the date continue up there? Surprisingly, it did. Really? I had like no expectations. Yeah, I. I wasn't planning on anything happening. I was just like, alright, well, let's see what happens, you know? Like. Or maybe she was just even inviting you to be polite cause she thought it was a polite thing to do after you walked her home. I don't know. I guess my mom's friends would say like, you want a glass of water or something? It wasn't like that polite, but. Right, right, right. How did things go up there? We're hanging out and we're watching TV. We start watching some game shows and we're laughing about how cheesy that is. And I guess like, cause all the tension was gone cause we were laughing with each other and just being ourselves. You know, one thing leads to another and We. We end up hooking up. Oh, my god. Did she. I mean, did she initiate this? I'm sure dudes say this all the time. It felt like it was mutual. It didn't feel like one of us made the initiative. yeah, yeah. That's a big switch from not wanting to talk to you to now they can't keep their hands off each other. Yeah, I mean, and that's why, as I remember it, I did not initiate, cause, you know, it felt like it was so not gonna happen. So. Anyway, that happens. It's really nice. She's great. Whatever. Um. And she's great. Whatever. I mean, I don't wanna give details. You know, I wanna. it's fine. It's fine. Did you stay the night? Well, here's the thing. Um, she gets up to use the bathroom, and then I hear the apartment door close. Okay. And I wait for

The one that got me grounded for a month. My dad had this iron clad rule in our house. Whoever complained about dinner had to cook the next night's meal for the entire family. It was his brilliant strategy to shut us up about my stepmom Raylan's absolutely catastrophic cooking. For two solid years, nobody dared say a word. Her meatloaf could legitimately break windows. Her chicken was dryer than the Sahara Desert. And her famous casseroles tasted like she mixed random leftovers with sadness and baked it at 450 degrees until it surrendered. But we all just sat there choking down every bite like good little soldiers because nobody wanted to face the humiliation of trying to cover six people. Then came that unforgettable Tuesday night when Raylan decided to get creative with deconstructed tacos. I'm using air quotes here because what she actually served was literally just wilted iceberg lettuce, stone cold ground beef right from the pan and stale hard shell tortillas that crumbled if you looked at them wrong. Everything was on separate plates like some kind of sad, depressing buffet. My ten year old sister Opal took one look at her plate, tried to eat everything and was still visibly hungry. Afterward. She's started tearing up because her stomach was growling. And that's when something inside me just completely snapped. Raylan, this isn't dinner. This is what happens when a grocery store display gives up on life. The Entire dining room went dead silent. Dad's fork froze halfway to his mouth and I could practically see the gears turning in his head. Raylan's face turned bright red and my older brother Paxton was staring at me like I just signed my own death warrant. Dad slowly put down his fork, cleared his throat and said with this smug little smile, well, congratulations, kiddo. Looks like you're cooking tomorrow night's dinner for all of us. But here's the thing dad had absolutely no clue about. For the past six months, I've been working weekend shifts at my Uncle Joseph's Italian restaurant downtown, not just busting tables or washing dishes, but actually learning everything from knife skills to sauce preparation to proper seasoning techniques. Josway had been teaching me real cooking because he said I had natural instincts and could potentially work in professional kitchens someday. Every Saturday and Sunday, I'd spend eight hours learning how to make fresh pasta, proper marinara from scratch and authentic Italian techniques passed down through three generations. The next evening, I walked into our kitchen with a game plan. I'd stopped at the grocery store after school and bought actual fresh ingredients with my restaurant money. Real ground beef, fresh tomatoes, white onions, authentic Mexican spices, masa harina for tortillas and everything needed for proper street tacos. I spent 3 hours hand pressing corn tortillas, slow cooking carnitas until they were fall apart tender, making fresh PICO de Gallo with perfectly diced ingredients, crafting Homemade salsa Verde.

I can't believe you're still saying it's not your fault. All you had to do was say I'm sorry and man up and say, you know, it's my fault. Shouldn't have done these things. I'm sorry I did those things. But, Anthony, take a deep breath because you're being, you sound crazy. So, let's start there. This is not, well, I lost a family member, so what am I supposed to do? Yes, you did. You're supposed to be angry that you lost your family member and you are not supposed to be blaming me something I didn't do. I thank you for helping me find him, but you were just fixing a situation that you caught. What? And then you didn't even text me later and say, I'm so sorry he's gone. You just said, oh, did they find him yet? Yeah. And that was my tone. Thank you for putting my tone onto what I said. Cause surely I wasn't texting, call me and talk about it. Surely I was texting you with an attitude. That's why I texted you. Oh, my God, if your friend's grandma dies, you just text them and say, hey, she fine. And you called him and console it. Haha. Anthony, you are not comparing a missing hamster to a dead grandma. He loves it. It's not the same. I, Had hamsters. They both died. You get over it. I mean, I don't mean to be sorry for your loss. I'm sorry for your loss. I had no idea that happened to you. At some point, you have to be like life. It has an end for everyone. And your hamster live long, well past. But we don't even know that Einstein is dead. It just got loose in a hibachi restaurant. You might be living the best life ever. Totally. What have you done to actually find him? Did you go back to the restaurant? Have you talked. Yes, to the staff? I've gone to that restaurant every single day for lunch and I've called them and tried to explain it anonymously. There's a bit of a language barrier. But every time they tell them, they think I let loose a rat in there. And I keep trying to tell them like, no, it's a pet. It's mine. Like now you just sound like racist. So like that, how am I racist? Um, the people are talking about we're working at the front of the restaurant, spoke perfect English. You're just trying to put the blame on everyone else. They don't understand you. I'm making a mess. You made just as many crumbs. We were eating at a table together. Melanie, you know what, I hear you saying a lot of stuff right now, but the one thing I don't hear you saying is, I'm sorry. It's my fault. Oh my gosh. Wow. Anthony, I feel like you're really missing out on a girl who has been understanding, who's been compassionate, who didn't think you were a total freak for bringing the hamster in the first place on the first date. Why would I be a freak for bringing a sick family member? Dude, you brought a sick rodent in your pocket on a date? That's weird, man. So what? People bring dogs to places all the time. How is that any different? Cancers are way cleaner than dog. I don't know if that's true. I will argue with you on that one. But I'm with you on the dog thing. I guess if that's your pet and you want to take it out. But still, I think you shouldn't blame Melanie for the entire thing. Oh, really? Okay, so you're on her side too. That's fine. That's fine. I guess everybody's against you, Anthony. Yeah, everybody's against me. You and my therapist should team up and say I'm wrong all the time. Weird. You're, you're in therapy too, huh? Couldn't not have guessed that. Maybe you Learned a lesson. Maybe you Learned a lesson that you shouldn't be bringing a hamster into a restaurant. Maybe next time I'll just be with a clean eater and we'll be fine. No. Alright. Well, eater Anthony. Well, you'll be eating alone a lot. Wait, wait, wait, wait. We gotta get an official answer. Anthony, would you like to go out with Melanie, again, on a second date, we will pay for it. Hard path. I don't have any more hamsters I can afford to lose. Haha. And Melanie, I'm guessing you're not heartbroken about that now. Oh my God. Oh, no, we're. I'm good. I'm glad we cleared this up because. Wow. All right. Well, you'll never forget this. So, Melanie. No, not for a very long time. Well, thank you both for your time. And if anybody knows the hamsters whereabouts, please send them our way. Please. I'm serious. If you see Einstein, he's mostly white, a little bit of brown Auburn patches towards his head. And he's very sassy. It's a sassy little hamster running around town. Make sure you snatch him up and send him to the radio station.

Alright, we're gonna, we're gonna stop for a second and try to sort this out. I, I think we need to figure out if this is really true or not. Okay, so we got an update a few minutes ago during the second date update. We were calling Pete to find out why he wasn't calling Hannah back. He hung up on us when we first got him on the phone. So producer Boyd went to his Facebook page to try to get like, like another contact form, a phone number or something, and found out through Pete's Facebook that he was actually engaged. And apparently, Percy Boyd then messaged his fiance, and he's telling me that she's on the phone right now. Is she really on the phone right now? She's online too. Is, uh, is this Jessica? Yeah? Do you have a, uh, fiance named Pete? Do I have a fiance named P? Yeah. I don't wanna do this. Uh, this is Jubal from Rick and Jubal in the morning. I'm moving 92.5. Um, can you describe Pete for me? Yeah, he's my fiance. We've been together for a while. We're getting married in the summer. He's okay. Is there. Really? Great. Um, just to, like. Why are you asking me this? How long have you been together? Well, we've been engaged for about a year. A little over a year. A year? Hang on, slow down. Hang on. Hannah, let's make sure this is the right dude, all right? Who is this? This is Brooke and Jubal in the morning. I'm moving 92.5. Hannah's on the phone with us. Hannah emailed us about a guy that she went out with and hooked up with who wouldn't call her back after they, you know, had a night of fun. That guy is your fiance? Is this a joke? No. Are you kidding me? That's not possible. Um, is there any way you've been out of town over the weekends? Yeah. When did this happen, Hannah? On Friday night. Okay. Were you with Pete on Friday night? No. And he. Oh, my god. I know, honey. And he didn't answer my phone calls or my texts on Friday. And are you. Are you got. Is this. It's not a joke. Okay, Jessica, so you. Where did Pete Tell you he was on Friday night. He said he had to work late, okay? And he didn't answer, and he wouldn't answer any of my texts or anything, and. Oh, my god, are you kidding me? Hannah, tell Jessica about what you did Friday night. I'm really sorry. I honestly had no idea this guy was engaged. I thought he was just a great guy, and we went on a date. We went back. You went on a date? Like a pre arranged date? What, you. I'm trying very hard to give him the benefit of the doubt and not freak out right now. What's Pete's last name? Jessica, what's Pete's last name? We'll beep it out. I'm a. Anna, what's the guy's last name that you went out with? Oh, are you kidding me? Have you guys had any problems with cheating before in your. No, not that I'm aware of.

Are you saying you were at a party or you, I, I don't understand what you're saying to me. Jessica, I would tell you to not get mad. At Hannah? Cause it sounds like Hannah legitimately didn't know that he had a fiance. So it's, um. It's. Well, I'm sorry. I don't know who I'm mad at right now. I'm just in shock. Okay, so cut me some black hair because.

Okay. Did you hop over a fence and start running away now? Um, is what happened, I mean, I hate to be the one to say it is what, is what happened a one night stand? I mean, isn't that what you think it is? No, because before we did anything, we were, we were like dating for almost a month. And even the night that he came over, he said to me, so where you wanna go for breakfast tomorrow? So. Oh, so you guys were sort of serious then? Yeah, I felt very serious. I mean, for me it was like the best boyfriend potential that I've had in a long time. But I feel like something happened when he spent the night and the next morning he just like took off. Okay. Why do you think he left? Okay, so this is kind of personal and gross and I'm not really sure how much I'm allowed to say on the radio. Well, I'll tell you what, why don't you just say it and then I'll bleep out anything that might be too bad. Okay, so like I said, he came over and he spent the night. It was our first night together and we made the decision that we weren't gonna have sex, but then we were pretty much doing everything else. So. Okay, so Okay, so you, you were, you were holding the runners at third base then. Yeah, pretty much. Um, so this is what I think happened. So we were messing around and I, you know, took care of business down there for him. And when I was done, he was like, okay, it's my turn. And I started freaking out because I never had a guy do that before. And so I was super nervous. Um, and anyway, he, he was, you know, doing the thing and like I said, I was really nervous the whole time. So I basically faked it so he'd stop. And then after it was over, we just fell asleep. And then the next morning, I'm in the shower and I'm thinking about where I wanted to take me for breakfast. And when I come out of the bathroom, he's gone. Ah, the old disappearing act. Yeah. And then I like run to the front window and his car is gone. So did he leave you a note or anything? Like call me later or. No. No, he just took off. So I sent him a text that said, like, so I guess that's a no on breakfast. And he never even wrote me back. So now I'm thinking there was maybe an emergency. So I text him and I asked, everything's okay? And I say, you kind of left in a hurry. And he finally writes me back and he just says, I'm cool. So I'm like, okay, well, do you wanna hang out again later? And he says, sorry, I can't. I'll hit you up later and then he never did. Wow. Okay. You said this was last weekend? No, it was two weekends ago. Oh, okay. So, so we could officially after two weeks and declare this relationship did yes, but why is the question exactly? So, um, um, Sarah, I almost said your real name there for a second. Um, you said you think you know what happened. I have a theory. Okay. What is your theory? So I'm on the keto diet right now and I, I don't know if you guys are familiar with it or not. The keto diet. Yeah, I, I mean, I've heard of it, but I don't know much about it. Yeah, I have a friend who's gonna try it or something. So yeah, it's okay. It's pretty great. But, um, one of the side effects is, uh, I'm trying to figure out how to say this. It, um, sort of changes the way a part of like a woman's anatomy can smell. Oh, oh, oh, okay. Oh, oh my God. Okay. I can't believe we're having this conversation. Um, so, okay, so it changes the way something smells and I'm assuming it changes it in a bad way. Yeah, for the most part, yeah, it just because your body's pH level changes and it changes like really drastically. So, okay. Okay. So that's The smell let let me just jump ahead to the finish line here you think that this guy visited the downtown area and was not happy with the aroma and that's why he took the a train out of town is that what you're so delicately trying to say? Yes okay and I mean I just don't want him thinking that that's how I normally am cause it's not it's just a guy I mean have we have we officially covered everything now with dirty work at this point like is there anything left? Well I mean apparently she's not lying I mean someone just texted it's true Google keto crush haha keto crotch yeah, I'm I just googled it and there's like 10 stories about it okay, how okay so what you want to know Sarah is if this Austin guy is done because of keto crotch and if he is you wanted to know that what he experienced is not the normal yes okay okay alright, how are we supposed to do this exactly are we supposed to call this guy up and be like hey have you ever heard of keto crotch? No I think I think we should call him up ask him why he ghosted her but we say we have a theory and then we ask if there was a specific reason okay but if she's right like he's definitely not gonna say that well we can just sort of hint at it and Say was that the reason? Okay, we will figure this out for you, Sarah, and we will call him when we come back.

Hi, is rose there? Yeah, speaking. Hey, rose, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Oh, okay. What's going on? Uh, is there a reason why you're calling me? There is. We actually got an email about you from one of our listeners. Okay. An email about me? Mm hmm. It's a guy you went out on a date with. Really? Yeah. His name is Ryan, and I'm sure you remember Ryan. He says you guys met at a friend's wedding. Yeah. Okay, well, he emailed us and told us a little bit about your date, but he also told us that you're not calling him back, so he asked if we could find out why you don't want to see him. Oh, wow. Okay. He sounded really excited about you. Yeah. Um, I. Yeah. Okay. Do you. Did you not like going out with him? I mean, I don't know if this is gonna go anywhere. And why is that? Can you tell us? Oh, my god. This is kind of awkward. Um, I can tell you what he told us. Okay, so he said that you guys met at the wedding and had fun and then went to go get sushi. Yeah. He said there was one awkward moment during your date, and he thinks that might be the reason you're not calling him back. Did he tell you what that was? Yeah, he said that he went into a little Thing about how he doesn't believe in underwear and how he doesn't like underwear and it's constricting and all that. And. Yep, he says he thought that might have weirded you out. Yep. Yeah, that happened. Um. I mean, it was. That was a lot of information on a first date. Was that. Was that the pivot point that turned you off from him? Well, he didn't even really need to tell me that part. What about the underwear? Yeah, you know, he was wearing shorts and I noticed at one point when I got up to go to the bathroom that he may have been revealing a little too much in the short. Wait, what do you mean? Be specific. I need specific. I think I know. Yeah, I think I do too. I think you guys know, like he was kind of hanging out for the world to see. Little. Yeah, I mean, I wasn't sure, but then he starts talking about how he doesn't believe in underwear and I thought, no, I was 100% right. I guess I can tell. Yeah, but. Alright, so maybe he should have been wearing underwear. Oh my god. Yeah. So wait, do you think it was an accident or was he like putting it on display for you? Oh god, I don't. I don't know. I mean, I hope it was an accident. I hope it was an accident too. It was just a lot of information at once. A lot. Of information. You should have reached across the table and tucked it back in for him. Oh, god. Did. I mean, is that if. If you guys were wearing shorts, would that be an easy mistake to make if you sit down? You never know. I mean, yeah, like, I feel like the shorts must have been pretty small. She must have gone adjusted. Yeah. I don't. I don't know if I need to hear that. Do you think it was an accident? I don't know, but, you know, to be honest, I don't really care. I don't know if I. If I wanna know. I don't. I don't feel like that's fair. I mean, if you had a nip slip and nobody told you about it, like, it's not something that you should get blamed for. But it's different. I mean, what if I was doing it on purpose and I didn't care and it was just out there? Yeah, I know how we can find out if he knew that? He was sort of dangling about. You know, like I said before, I really don't care at this point. Well, I think Ryan cares, and he's actually on the other line and wants to talk to you.

Please put me in your do not call list. You might be interested. I'm not, like, trying to sell you anything. This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. It's a radio show. A radio show? Yes. I don't want you to buy anything. Can I talk to you for a second, please? Um, I'll make it quick. I'll get to the point. Okay. You recently went on a date to the zoo and puked. What? That was quick into the point. How did you know that? I know that because the guy you went out with, Brad, he wanted us to call you because you haven't been answering any of his phone calls or text messages. So he thought maybe we could find out what happened and why you don't want to go out with him again. Why do you think I wouldn't call him back? That was probably the worst date. No, that was definitely the worst date I've ever had. Oh, my god. Ever had? It sounds horrific. Like, not only just, like, the allergic reaction or whatever happened to you and the puking, but the monkeys freaking out and children crying. Wow. He told you everything? Awesome. Yeah, that's, um. That's okay. Great. He also told us That he really liked you and isn't like, weirded out by the fact that you threw up all over the monkeys. Not all the monkeys. No, I'm, I. That's. He's just being nice. I mean, I projectile vomited everywhere. It was disgusting. Like, kids were crying. It was. It was the worst. And like, I even had like, an issue downstairs too. Just. Just to round it all out. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh, girl. But here's the thing. If this guy still wants to get a hold of you, he obviously really likes you. Like, if you can do all of that on a first date and he still thinks you're awesome. Honestly, I think he's probably just being nice because I can't imagine anyone, anyone wanting to go back out with me. Well, I mean, he went to a radio show to call you because he wanted to go out with you again. And I don't think he knows about your downstairs issue, whatever that was, cause he didn't bring that up. Poor thing. Well, I think I blamed it on the monkeys. Oh, my god. Oh, man. What did you feel like when your mom finally came? Oh, my god. I kind of. I mean, I. Who wants to, like, cry in front of a guy to their mom? But I kind of did cause I was mortified. It's just embarrassing. You're okay now, though, right? Yeah, I mean, I'm fine. It's just my ego. But You know, I've had a lot of allergies my whole life, and it's just weird allergies like strawberries, orchids, shark. I'm just embarrassed by the whole thing. I don't even know what to say to him, so I'd rather just stay away. So that is why you're not calling him back? You're not calling him back because you're embarrassed about vomiting and all the other bodily functions that happened? Yes. I mean, how could we ever come back from an experience like that? Well, I think that just means that you guys have moved to the next stage in your relationship. You know, a lot of people put pride in that. They're like, we're so close, we go to the bathroom with the door open. You're like, I don't even wait for a bathroom. I did in the zoo. You know, you guys are close now. I don't know. Well, I'd be interested to see how he feels, and we can ask him, because he's actually on the other line listening right now. Wants to talk to you. Hey, Janine.

Oh, wow. Okay. So, alright, well, let's start off with your husband. What is his name? Eric. Okay. And how long have you guys been married? Oh, gosh. Uh, it's six years next April. Okay. So you think, you said you think he's cheating and you know who it's with? I think I know, yes. Uh, the girl's name is Crystal. Okay. And who exactly is she? I don't know. I think she's like a friend of his. They've like, they knew each other before we met and like he's talked about her before. But I'm, I don't know. I'm just, I'm pretty sure this is more than just a friendship. Okay. So why do you think your husband is cheating with her? Like, what, what? Let me ask this. What evidence has LED you to believe this? Ah, okay. So I have a friend who, who works at the, and she saw them eating dinner together one night and then she texted me, you know, it's like, hey, I know it's none of my business, but are you aware your husband is having dinner with this other woman right now? And of course, I was like, uh, nope, my husband is supposed to be at a friend's house watching a football game. And she said, well, I'm looking at him right now and he's definitely having pic or having a, having dinner. With someone and then she sent me a picture oh okay so you you actually have the evidence then kind of she she only sent me a picture of the woman but she couldn't like get a picture of them together she said she like tried to get close to the table but was afraid my husband would fear so she's trying to be kind of sneaky about it um, but she did get a picture like a full front face photo of this woman coming out of the bathroom oh okay okay so you so you have a photo but you don't have a photo of them together did you ask your husband about it? Like you should have sent him a copy of that photo of of the other woman and be like hey do you know this person? I I did text him after we talked and I you know just asked how the game was going and he said you know it's fine I'll bring some chicken wing home you know he said he said he's gonna bring you some chicken wings up did he bring you chicken wings home? He he did but like you know he could have just stopped and gotten some there's so many options. That's true yeah, that's true he could have done that I have a question so if he was supposed to be on a date with this other girl wouldn't he been like all dressed up like did He look like he was overdressed for a football game at a friend's house. I mean, I don't know, not really like the place they were eating wasn't like a fancy restaurant or anything. Okay. So even if he was on a date, it was a casual date. Yeah, you wouldn't dress up at this place. Okay. So, but you know the place where they were eating that that can actually help us. How about we call him and be like, hey, the lady you were with, uh, accidentally left some jewelry here. Did you happen to have her phone number for us or something like that? Uh, no, I, I don't I think I don't want you to call him. I want you to call her. Oh, you want us to call her? Yeah, I, I really wanna know if like, was she really out with my husband? And if she was, I want to hear it from her. Okay. So question. How are we supposed to do that exactly if we don't have her phone number? I do have her phone number though. Oh, you do? I do. Okay. Okay. Well, that changes everything. Okay. So, um, alright, so about this, what you can do is we can still pretend to be like the restaurant. We could call her. We'd be like, hey, we wanted to make sure our service lived up to your expectations on your evening out the other night or something like that. But anyways. We can see if she acknowledges that she was on a date or something. We can do that if you want. I mean, whatever. I just, I just want to know if she was on the date with my husband. Gotcha. And what's her name again? This other woman? It's Crystal. Okay. Well, get the number for us. Cause when we get back, we will call Crystal and we will find out exactly what was going on next. The idea here is that hopefully, there we go, we can get her to admit that she was on a date. That's what we're trying to go for here.

Please don't hang up. All I want to do is let you know that Russell likes you a lot. That's it. He said really kind things. He said that you saw him. He said she was a person who saw me for who I was. And he gets so nervous. I mean, you could tell the guy is like. He never asks anyone out. Are you there? No, I'm here. I'm just so embarrassed. I really hate to talk about this. I, I understand that. Tanya, we did hear about your first date with Russell. Oh, my god. Understand that it's an embarrassing thing, but you. It's happened to a lot of people in this time. Fart. And. Look, Russell didn't have a problem with it at all. He just really wanted to continue your date and is. I cannot. I can't believe. I can't believe he told you. I don't even tell, like, my friends. Like, nobody. Oh, my god. Nobody knows. But, Tanya, once you get a little distance from it, it'll be a funny story. You're just too Close to it. Right now you're just remembering how you felt in that moment. Like, come on. If you could look at it as an outsider, you could see it's pretty comical. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It's like I'm getting hives. This is horrible. Don't get hives. I know. Hey, Tanya, don't get hives. We understand it's an embarrassing thing. We won't focus on that part of the date if you don't want to. But we would like to talk to you about Russell a little bit, if that's cool. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, thank you, I. I do really appreciate it. And Russell appreciates it. Russell said that he really liked you and he was having a good time until you left, and he just wants to be able to talk to you again. So maybe you guys can go out. I can never face him again. What? Come on. But what if he doesn't care, though? It's just one fart. Tanya, don't let that. Oh, my god, you said it. Oh, my god. I know, I know, but everybody does it. That's the thing. Like, yeah, it sucks that it happened to you on a first date. That totally sucks. I totally get that. Just really embarrassing because, like, I am on a new diet, and I. I, like, I'm still adjusting, and, like, you know things about what's going on with your body, but you can't, like, control it. Yeah, like, I could feel it. Rumbling, like, of course. Like, as soon as I got there. And I was just, like, waiting for the moment. As soon as I could excuse myself. And I had no control. Yeah, it's understandable. It happens. And Russell wasn't really bothered by it at all. I think he understands that, man. And I know that you want to get off the phone. You're embarrassed, so I'm just gonna tell you right now, Russell is actually on the other line listening and wants to talk to you. No, no, no. Yes, yes, yes. It's a good thing, Tanya. It's all good. It's fine. Oh, my god. Yes, Tanya, I'm. I'm here. Please don't hang up. Can I talk to you for a minute

Sleeping is not illegal. Okay? Breaking and entering is. Yeah, for sure. I didn't break in, okay? Dad doesn't know, right? Yeah. So you're not supposed to be in there. It's coming. That's why I was saying that's. The reason you're probably not getting a call back is because you broke into his place. No, I feel like you guys are twisting my words or something. I think you're not hearing your own words is the problem. Wait, what happened? Did he, like. Did you stay till the morning? I did. And then, um. I love to cook, so I went in his kitchen, and I thought the right thing was to make him something to eat, so I made him crepes. That and did. He is crazy. That's crazy. Yeah. Did he wake up and freak out that there was some woman in his house making him breakfast? Dude, seriously, this is like the plot of a freaking horror film at this point. I don't get what you guys are reacting to. Because Nick invited me over. Uh huh. Yeah. But while he was awake, before he fell asleep, how did he react when he found you in his house making breakfast? He was really surprised. Yeah? Yeah. And we talked for like, 10 minutes while I started to make him coffee, and he insisted that I didn't need to do that. Yeah. Which I thought was really thoughtful of him. Like, he wanted To take care of me. Like, don't do that. That's not what he was doing. Yeah, no, he was telling you probably to get out of his house, because that was really a huge breach of security. Trust. All of it. I don't know. Everything. Yeah, breach of everything. Agree to disagree, guys. But I did leave, okay? He said he had to get going. He said he had plans for the day. I mean, I didn't have work, so I offered for us to spend time together, but, you know, I get it. He was tired. He worked really late, but, um. Yeah, so I thought we hit it off when we talked. What? Okay. But now he's not returning my calls, and I just wanna know that he's okay, and he's really cute. I don't think we should do this. I don't think we should call this man on your behalf. He's probably still scared. No, he works really hard, guys. Does he have a restraining order? Yeah, I got that. What? Nothing. We'll, uh, we'll play a song and then come back and call him and get your second date update. Okay. Oh, my god. Thanks, guys. Yep. Hold on. Oh, my god. Moving 92.5, Brooke and Jubal in the mornings. Second date update. You know, the more that I think about it, the more I think there was nothing wrong with what Cece did for her first date with Nick. If you're just joining us for Today's second date update. Cece is on the phone, and she made plans to meet up with this dude Nick through Tinder, but then when it was actually time for the date, he kept having to postpone cause he was at work. Anyway, fast forward to about 10:30 at night. He said, you can come over to my place for drinks. She did that, but then he wasn't answering the door, so she spent about 20 minutes trying to get him to text her back or answer the door or something. Nothing happened. So she talked to a neighbor and then told the neighbor that she was his sister. And it turns out the neighbor had a key and actually let her into Nick's apartment. Oh, scary. But don't worry, she didn't wake him up. She just slept in his bed until the next day. Okay, that's good. He was on the couch and then woke him up with breakfast. And now she's confused why she's not getting a call back. Cece, are you ready to call him and figure out the problem? Yeah, more than ever. You cannot be this clueless. Like, you have to know why he's not calling you back. What you did is wrong on lots of levels. Yeah, multiple reasons. Okay, I appreciate the feedback, Brooke, and that's why I called you. I just know that I don't believe I was anything more than assertive. Nick never acted scared. I didn't harm him. He was Just surprised. Okay, this is surprise. Okay. well I'm gonna dial his phone number right now and surprise him again. Okay, thank you. And I hope when you guys get him on the phone, you'll realize and did not do anything that cross the line. Okay? Got you. Alright, well, I'm gonna dial his phone number right now. Okay, thank you. You're welcome.

Oh my god, no! I'm so freaking out for you right now. Oh my god. How the did he get this number? I have a different number. I changed my number. Yeah, he told us that. Actually, he got your number now because apparently he hit up one of your friends on Facebook and they gave him your new number. I'm sorry, what? Yeah, I don't know which friend it is. We need to find that out. You need to block them. I cannot believe someone would give my number out without even asking me. So I'm gonna take a shot in the dark here and just guess that you don't like Craig very much. That's a good guess, yes. Is there a reason why? I don't know what you know already, but I met him at an antique store and he was there cause he, I guess, also likes antiques. Uh huh. But the entire conversation, I wish that I can remember word for word what exactly he said, but it was so, so strange. He would ask me about like, previous relationships were like. And I'd be like, well, this is kind of what has happened in my life. And he's like, well, when I'm your boyfriend, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Not like if I was your boyfriend, but when I'm your boyfriend. And I was like, okay, that's a little too intense for me. Especially within the first half hour of meeting Someone. Jennifer, that's the power of positive thinking. No, just say you're already doing it and you'll do it. It'll happen. Why did. Yeah, why didn't you run just then? I mean, just. Even those words alone are enough to be a trigger point for me. It was a trigger for me. And he reached out to me over 70 times through text and Facebook. And then I disconnected my number so that he couldn't get to me through my phone number anymore. Over 70 times? Oh my god. Oh my god. How long? What time span are we talking about? Just like a couple days. This was. This was over the entire year. It doesn't matter. That's 70 messages? Yeah. Over the course of a year. All ignored that. That you never replied to? Nope. Not a single reply. What did you do when you saw him in the bar? I would have pissed myself. Well, I heard his voice first and I instantly knew who it was. He was behind me and he said, hey, Jennifer. And I was like, literally pit of my stomach dropped out cause I knew it was him. And I turned around and I didn't know what to do. I'm sure my face was pure shock. Oh my god. And terror. Oh my god. Cause I didn't know what to do, so I just said hi. And then he sat down next to me and he sat there for almost an hour talking. To me. Yeah, right. And. And luckily I was meeting someone and they showed up and we left and went to a different place. Yeah, cause it's not like you can just leave the bar. He's gonna follow you. And then that's even creepier cause you're in a back alley somewhere with him. Exactly. Here's my question, though, Jennifer. Why did you give him your number again? That's a good one. Oh, yeah, Jennifer. Well, I didn't know what to do because I felt like those sorts of situations, I'm very uncomfortable because I hate to say no to people. So I was like, I'm gonna see him again. Is it gonna be more awkward if I don't give him my number and, like, in I turn him down at this bar in front of everyone? Or should I just, like, give him my number and then avoid him like I did last time and just ignore the situation? Which is probably not the healthiest approach, but I wasn't sure what to do. Hey, I don't blame you. Whatever you needed to do to get out of it, I am fully supportive of you. So basically, he's a weirdo who loves himself some Jennifer, and Jennifer does not love herself some crack. No, I do not love myself. From Craig. Jennifer, I need to let you know he is on the other line listening to this conversation. Sorry, what? And he wants to talk to you, but. Oh, my god.

He said that he liked you a lot, but he can't figure out why. It's been two and a half weeks, and you haven't returned any of his phone calls. Oh, my god. Okay, um, I don't know what to say. Well, you can start off by maybe telling us if you liked him. Um, yeah. I mean, he was really, really nice. He was a nice guy. So you did like him? Let me ask you a more important question. What did you think of his mom? Oh, my god. Uh. Oh, my god. How did you know that? Well, because Ben talked to us about your date. He told us how you guys went out for drinks and then went to go see a play, and his mom showed up before the play and then joined you guys on the date, and not only that, but drops you off, apparently, at the end of the evening, too. Yeah, that is romance. Oh, wow. What did you think when his mom walked into the lobby of the theater? It was really weird. Okay, I can't even imagine you're on the same page as we are, then. Yeah, because we tried to explain to him that's a strange move to do on a first date, and he was like, no, I swear, my mom and her hit it off. She thought it was great. She had a wonderful time. Actually, that part was totally true. She. It was weird at first. Really? What? It was. It was weird at first. It was totally weird at first. But she was actually really, really cool. I'm really into theater, and she knows so much about theater and theater history, and she was, like, telling me all these stories and. So you actually enjoyed your time with his mother? I really did. Wow. All right, well, if you. If you enjoyed his mom so much, why aren't you calling him back for another date? I mean, that could be your mother in law if you play your cards right. I don't think that I should say, did I? I mean, we have to know. If it wasn't the mom, what could it be? Oh, god. They just. I don't wanna hurt his feelings. I think. I think he's actually pretty resilient. We poked fun at him pretty hard when we talked to him, and he seemed to take it pretty well. Yeah, I. I really. I don't know. It sounds pretty bad to me. Well, here's the thing, right? Whenever somebody signs up to do one of these second date updates, we let them know that they might hear something they don't want to, right? So Ben is willing to hear whatever news it is that you have to say. We'll clean it up a little bit when we talk to him, you know, sugarcoat it if we need to, but if You can just tell us what it is. At least he will know. Yeah. Okay. Um. Okay. During the play, I was sitting in between them. Um. Oh, my god, that's so awkward. Yeah, I didn't realize that piece. I'm sorry. No, no, honestly, it was good. It was. It. It. She was really great to talk to. And I like talking to him, too, so it really was okay. But, uh, about halfway through the play, she was whispering to me about the play and stuff, and then she said there was an actor in the play, the one that I guess got them the tickets. Uh huh. And, um, he was

Vic told us that, you know, He showed up and it was awkward or whatever, he says that he felt like you were flirting with him the whole time while you were out with his coworker. Is that true? Sounds like it's true. Well, I don't think it was the whole time. Okay, dude, if you were flirting with any man that was dressed as a clown for any amount of time, I feel like that means that you must like him a lot because clowns are not easy to be attracted to unless you have a clown fetish. Susan, do you have a clown fetish? No. No. He was really cute. He wasn't wearing the nose or anything. Oh, my God. You sound excited. Um, I don't know. I just, I had a really good time. Um, and if you talk to him, could you tell him my mashed potatoes were running? Your mashed potatoes were running. Yes. What does that mean? I don't know. What do I mean? Hold up. It was just like an inside joke between us. Could you tell him that? Sure. Susan, shouldn't you tell him like you'd like to see him again or something, not your mashed potatoes were running. Yeah, I just, I just want him to know because we were talking about it for a while. So he'll get it. He'll get it. It's funny. Okay. Well, hey, Susan, hang on. Hang on. Let's see if he gets it. Hey, Vic, her mashed potatoes are ready.

Is this Britney? Yes. Hi, Britney. How are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Are you serious? I am serious. Oh, my God. Okay. Hi. Hi. What's going on? Hi, Britney. Not, not much. What are you all doing? Oh, just hanging out, you know, figured we'd give you a call and check in and see how your day is going. Okay. Why are you calling me? It's a great question. Well, I want to talk to you about something for a second, something you might not even remember. Okay. It happened back when you were in high school. Oh, gosh. Is this for real or like, is this a prank? No, this is not a prank. This is for real. Okay. This is a little different. Like. Okay. So there was a dude named Trevor that you went to high school with. Do you remember a guy named Trevor? Trevor in my class, yeah. Let me see if I can jog your memory a little bit. Okay. So you guys went to high school together. I guess he was in one of your classes. And one day you guys studied together. Okay. That still could be a lot of people. I'm thinking you might remember studying with this guy. He was a freshman and you were a sophomore. Okay. And I guess you guys had geometry together. Okay. And one day after school, you went over to his house to study. Okay. Okay. Nothing yet. Remember Trevor? No, not really. Okay. Um, well, the only other way that I think I could get you to remember him is he tried to impress you with a veggie tray. Oh my gosh. So you remember, you remember the veggie tray? I do. I do remember that. Oh, that was the karate guy. The karate veggie tray guy. Yeah. So, and Trevor actually emailed us because he wanted us to get a hold of you because he had a huge crush on you in high school and I guess still kind of has a crush on you and saw you on Facebook the other day and wanted to see if you'd go out with him. Yeah. Oh my god. Are you for real? Yeah, I am 100% serious. Yeah. He told us the whole story about how you asked him to study and it was like seriously the most memorable moment of all of his high school career. Oh god. Oh my god. That's so weird. Were you interested, were you interested in Trevor in high school or was that just a study session for you? I just needed to pass geometry and he, he was the smart guy. No doubt he was the smart kid. Was it obvious that he liked you though? I don't know. I mean, he was younger. So you know how it is like the younger guys, you know, look up to the older girls, right? And as a sophomore, you Don't want to date a freshman? I mean, come on. This whole thing was so long ago. I kind of remember that afternoon. It would be hard to forget with the veggie tray is, but, um, you know, it, it didn't get like totally weird until the next day when his mom called me. Wait, his mom called you? Yeah. Oh, my God. I've never told anybody about this. Yes. His mom called me and she told me that Trevor had been really, really upset and crying in his room. Oh, man. Oh, my gosh. And it was just all devastated. And she wanted me to make sure that I knew that, like, he was a really good kid and that, and they said that the veggie tray was her idea. Oh, my God. She said she actually calls you to let you know the veggie tray thing was hers. Yes. She said she was just trying to help her son on his first date. Oh, my God. I am mortified for him. Oh, my God. I was like dying because I'm like, this was not a date. I'm trying to explain to her, it's like I need to help with geometry. That's, it seems like we were actually just studying. That's all I wanted to go over there and do is study. Yeah. It, oh, gosh, it was crazy. And she went on and on about how all he wanted to do was kiss me and she was trying To help him. Oh, man. He didn't know what happened, like how it work these days. And so she was all so apologetic about the vegetables and like, it wasn't about the vegetable. Were you just stunned on the other end of the phone? I wouldn't even know what to say. I'm embarrassed. As a kid, it's so nerve wracking like when an adult call you in the first place. Right. But the end of the conversation, she was trying so hard. I mean, I guess it's kind of sweet that she offered to drive us to the movies if we wanted that, to have a date. And I was just like, um, no, thank you. Goodbye. Oh, my gosh. You could have destroyed him in high school sharing that story. No, I, but I didn't have the heart to do that because it's so tough anyway. And I remember that's why I didn't talk about it. I didn't tell him about it. That is nice of you. That's very, that's really nice of you not to put him on blast for his whole high school. You are. I wonder if he knows cause he didn't mention to us about his mom calling you. When we talk to him, I hope for his sake he doesn't know. He doesn't need to know. Well, whatever his mom told him, if he didn't know before, he knows now cause he's on the other line listening to this conversation. No. Yes. Trevor, what's Up

Oh, okay, so you got the whole awkward seeing each other naked part out of the way on the first night, then. That's a good strategy. What is the girl's name? Uh, her name is Lisa. Okay, so you and Lisa hooked up, but that turned into dating? Yeah, but, like, here's the. Here's the thing. Every time we went out, she gets dropped off by an Uber. So I just kind of finally started offering to take her home if she wanted. And both times she was like, can you just drop me off at a friend's apartment? I'm supposed to hang out with her tonight, type of thing. And I'm like, so she. Okay, so she Uber's to you, and she gets dropped off at the end of the day at a friend's place? Yeah. So she's married? Yes. How did you know that? Well, she doesn't want you to see where she lives. And she slept with you the first night you met her. It sounds like a cheating wife to me. Like, that's not all. So one night, I asked if we could go back to her place, and she's like, there's something I need to tell you. Please don't freak out. I'm technically married. Technically. Technically. I like how she put that. I'm technically married. That's like usher saying I technically just gave you herpes. Yeah, so I asked her. I said, um, if you're married, what are you doing out with me? And she's like, well, my husband and I have an open marriage. He doesn't have a problem with it. That's probably a lie, too. Yeah, well, I mean, that's why I called you guys. You guys think she's lying? Well, have you ever met her husband? No, definitely not. Okay, but she says no, it's cool if. Because we have an open marriage. Correct. Ask to meet her husband so that you can hear him say it. Well, that's what I was kind of hoping you guys could, uh. Could do. Oh, so you. Okay, so you want us to find out if her marriage is really open or if it's the other kind of marriage, you know, like normal people do? Exactly. Okay, but I have a question. So say their marriage is an open marriage. Are you okay with being in that type of situation? Not really. But it's like, with this girl. I don't know. I just, I. I can't even describe the things she does without getting in trouble. Like, if I told you, I would get kicked off the radio. Oh. Oh, okay. Okay, so this girl completely blows your mind? Among other things. So for you, it wouldn't matter that she was still married? I mean, it wouldn't matter if. If. If what she said was true. Okay, but you're Not sure it is, no. Okay, I'm betting you, like, a hundred bucks that she's lying to you and we're gonna get this husband on the phone and he's just gonna be like, um, open marriage? Yeah. What? Well, hold on. I have an idea. Why don't we try to get them both on the phone at the same time, so you'll have them both on, and then you can come in and be like, so your wife says you have an open marriage. What's that? Like, you wanna do that? Uh, that's. That's fine with me if you. If you think you can do it. God, I hope so, because that would be the most awkward thing in the world to hear when she's on the line and then he's on the line and we're like, so about that open marriage. So. Okay, I have a plan forming, so let's talk during this break, and then we come back, we're gonna make it happen. What we're attempting to do is we're trying to get her on the phone. Her name is Lisa. We're gonna try to get Lisa on the phone, but we're also trying to get her husband on the phone at the same time. And then we're gonna ask, so you're in an open marriage, right? And your husband's cool with it? And if the husband is on the phone, do you think she'll tell the truth, or do you think she'll be like, um, I think She'll tell the truth. I think she's gonna get caught with her pants down and I think this is. I think she's gonna like it. I think. Yeah, she will. Obviously. I think this is about to be the most awkward thing we've done. I guess I should say I hope she tells the truth. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So, alright, so now here's the other problem. We don't have her husband's phone number. Right. So we gotta figure out a way to get that. Let's call up Lisa first.

And that's where if a listener of ours goes out on a date with somebody and ends up getting blown off, we get an email from them asking if we can call that person and ask why. So somebody sent us an email about Isabella that doesn't even make sense. How long have you someone? Yeah, somebody recently met Isabella and has been texting with her and thought that everything was going well and then Isabella kind of stopped responding to him and told them not to text anymore and they were hoping to get a second date. Um, are you in Are you in a person? We've been, we're together like, so there's no way she's going out on a date with someone else. Yeah, right. No, especially not recently. Hey, Aaron, I don't want to try to blow up her spot like this not might not be a bad thing. How long have you guys been together? Cause she could, it could be that you just recently met a guy or whatever. No, you know, it's not even possible. You we've been together for a long time on and off. So maybe during one of those off periods something could have happened. But even that seems unlikely. I know, I know this is probably a hard phone call to take and to hear. Not hard to hear, but it's doesn't make sense. Not even possible. Aaron, a guy emailed us and he's been texting with Isabella. They met at a party a few weeks ago, hung out, had a good time. He thought that she was into him and then she said, don't text me anymore and stop texting him. That's why he wanted us to call. Right? But I'm on her phone now. I've checked her phone. There's no text messages from any guy. Okay. I can assure you that. You check her phone all the time enough. We trust each other. Whatever, you know, I like trust.

I'm just trying to help you get to the bottom of it because this is the phone number that we got from another dude who said that he met Isabella look, if you have some guy that's calling you then why don't you tell him he's mistaken and he's got the wrong person and she's got a boyfriend and to just like back off and stop harassing her okay, I'll do that for you. Hey, Jake, back off. Isabella has a boyfriend. His name is Aaron. This is so uncomfortable Aaron Jake the guy who says he met Isabella is actually on the phone with us right now Jake, say hi to Aaron. Hey, so how long have you guys been dating?

I don't know who the fuck you are. I don't have a problem with you, but you keep pushing down this road, we're gonna have a fucking problem. You need to back off. I don't know. What are we going on? You've made a mistake. All right, Jake, why don't we, why don't we just ask Isabella who she wants? Yeah, why don't we ask Isabella? Yeah, why don't we ask Isabella? Oh God, this is so uncomfortable, Aaron. I mean, I know you have her phone right now, but how can we get a hold of her? I'm not gonna give you any of your info. Where is she? She must be coming back soon. This is ridiculous. I am with Isabella. We are together. No, you can't talk to her. No, we're not gonna go through.

And I tell him all the time to just talk to her, but he won't do it. It's almost like he's catfishing her, but without making up a fake person. Okay, so how long has this been going on? It's been going since Christmas. I mean, it started Christmas. He got her this little Monet calendar for her desk, cause I guess she likes Monet or something. So this has been going on for six months, then? Wow. Okay, so what do you need us to do? So what I wanna do, I wanna talk to him and once again, try to tell him to just tell Katrina how he feels. But I thought you could have her listening, you know, on the other line, so when we talk about it, she can hear what's going on. Then finally she'll know the truth, and you won't have to keep, like. Yeah, I don't know, man. This sounds like a bad idea. I mean, is there. Is there a reason he hasn't told her already? I mean, like I said, he gets, like, zero self confidence. He works in IT, so he's like, kind of nerdy, but not like dorky nerdy. He's just. He's just smart. Just a smart guy, you know? He's a little overweight. Not like gross overweight or anything. Okay, Well, I mean, what happens, like, if we get her on the phone and then she hears it's Brian and she rejects him? I mean, have you thought about that? Yeah, I have, but we gotta do this now. It's now or never. Okay, why after six months does it have to happen now? Cause there's the guy. Can I swear? Yeah, go ahead. There's a total head in our building named Decker, and he asked her out on Monday. Now, this guy is a complete D bag, and all he's gonna do is date her, try to get in her pants, and brag to his D bag friends here at work about it, and then just dump her. Okay, so we gotta do this now, or else she ends up with Decker, the D bag. Exactly. Eric, how hot is this Katrina girl? Like, on a scale from 1 to 10? I mean, she's pretty hot. Everyone here at work dresses up. Still at work, she's like a 9. I don't know what she's like at home. And sweatpants. Okay, so you would be willing to risk your entire friendship with Brian to put him on the spot like this, expose this secret love he has, and then pray to Jesus that she thinks he's dateable? Yeah, I would. Okay, and just so you know, if she rejects him, it's all out on the air, like, making it 10 times worse for him. Like I said, I got no Choice. Okay, well, this is. This is either going to be amazing radio or what I imagine the Hindenburg sounded like when it exploded. But either way, it's coming up next.

Do you know Ross? Um, not really. Can I be honest with you? I'm having a hard time believing that this is not a guy named Ross or somebody that told someone else their name is Ross and gave them this number. I'll tell you why. Okay, because one of our listeners recently met you online. This is the number they have. They said your name was Ross. You had a profile set up and everything else. They drove two hours to meet you and then you ditched them at a pizza place. What did you laugh about? What's so funny? I know what's going on. Trust me, I don't. Can you tell me? I was just getting her back. Okay. What? That's all that was going on. You're getting her back? Yeah, it was pretty ingenious in my part, actually. Haha, I'm so confused. Alright, you sound really proud of yourself. Explain to me what you're talking about. Well, Sheena broke up with me about 6 months ago. We dated for off and on for almost a year. I caught her cheating with another guy. So, you know, I thought I'd have a little fun. No way. Wait. So what did you do? I used a picture of some Other guy, I messaged her. We messaged back and forth. So I figured I'd send her a little wild goose chase two hours away. Oh my god. So you catfish your ex girlfriend basically pretty much all that work to just make her drive two hours away and sit at a pizza place by herself. Oh, yeah, it made me happy. Very happy. Ross, you've never heard of like the high road taken that she missed out on the high road about six months ago. So, you know, you sound really proud of yourself. Well, I didn't know she was gonna emphasize it by calling your radio station. This is great. I cannot believe you. So that voice right there is Sheena.

First, Maggie, who's on the phone to do a second date update today, just admitted to us that she has been with 30 guys in the last week. Impressive statistics, Maggie. Good job, girl. Yeah, thank you. If you missed the first part of the second date update, Maggie met this guy named Ray at a bar. They went out for a coffee date. After meeting up, she said everything was going well, but she made a joke to him. When he said, like, something along the lines of, I bet you go on a lot of dates, her response was, yeah, I've been on 30 dates in the past week. The only thing is, he didn't get the joke, and he just kind of sat there like, oh, my god. And that's why she thinks she's not getting a call back, because he still doesn't think that it's a joke. It's pretty hard to go out with that many people in one week. So hopefully, maybe, Maggie, we can get him to realize that and go out with you again. Are you ready to give him a call? Yes, for sure. This one's so weird to me because he asked you to go out to dinner at the end of the day. I mean, he was obviously complimenting your looks when he said, you must get asked out a lot. I don't get that one little joke would make him not call you. I know, I know. So I'm excited to see what the problem is. One little joke you didn't get? The fact that he was. If, like, he was thinking that you really went out with 30 guys in a week, that's bigger than a little joke. All right, you're right. I'm gonna dial his phone number right now and see if we can get him on the phone. Okay? Okay. Hello? Hi, can I speak to Ray, please? Yeah, this is Ray. Hey, Ray, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Who? Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. It's a radio show. Okay. How's it going? Fine. Any idea why I'm calling you? Uh, no. We recently got an email about you from one of our listeners. Okay. Her name is Maggie, and you recently went out on a date with Maggie. Okay. Okay. Do you remember that happening? Yeah. Okay, well, Maggie emailed us because she's wondering why you haven't given her a call back, especially at the end of the date when you were, like, talking about maybe meeting up for dinner or something. She hasn't heard from you, so she asked if maybe we could get you on the phone to find out why. Oh. Is there a reason you're not calling Maggie back? Uh, I mean, it's just. It's probably not gonna work out. Oh, Man, Ray, why is that? Uh, I don't know. I just. I don't Think we're. I don't think we're a good match. Is there a specific reason why you think that? Um. Ray, you're a hard guy to read. I agree. So what if. What? Why don't you. Why don't you think you guys would be a good match? I don't know. I mean, Maggie, she's a really nice girl. Probably one of the nicest girls I've met in a little while.

But I'll talk later, piano boy. She had a neighbor. Hey, neighbor. I have something to tell you. What is it? It's about your boyfriend. You're not jealous of him, are you? What? No. The thing is, I saw him with a few other girls at the skate park. Oh, really? Probably just his friends. They look more than friends to me. What do you mean by that? I don't know. He was just very touchy. Okay, well, you stop it. Huh? You are obviously jealous and trying to give him a bad image. Um, I'm really not. I couldn't Care less. Just thought I would tell you since we are neighbors after all. Whatever. I don't believe you. Fine. Go down to the skate park and see for yourself then. Ugh. Know what? Fine, I will.

My ex wife's family never liked me from day one. Her parents thought I was too rough around the edges, just a blue collar construction worker who dropped out of college. While their daughter Katie had her master's degree in education and came from old money, they made it crystal clear I wasn't good enough for their precious daughter. Her mom would make comments like, I hope you're planning to go back to school. And her dad would ask when I was going to get a real career instead of manual labor. When Katie and I divorced five years ago after eight years of marriage, her whole family practically threw a Celebration. Her mom actually said good riddance to that monster right in front of me. At the custody hearing, her dad told the judge I was a deadbeat who would never amount to anything and shouldn't have unsupervised visits with my daughter. They fought tooth and nail to keep me away from seven year old Emma, said I was too aggressive, too unpredictable, not the kind of role model a little girl needed in her life. The judge gave me every other weekend only. And even then, Katie's parents would show up to supervise my time with my own daughter. Her mom would sit in my living room during visits watching me like I might snap at any moment. She'd criticize everything from the food I served Emma to the movies we watched together made me feel like a criminal in my own home. After the divorce, I threw myself completely into work, started my own contracting business with a beat up truck and $5,000 in savings. I was determined to prove every single one of them wrong. To show Emma that her dad wasn't the failure they all said I was. I work 18 hour days, seven days a week, saved every penny, reinvested everything back into the business. I hired good guys, treated them fair, and we built a solid reputation for quality work, no corners cut, no shoddy materials, everything done right the first time. My little construction company grew faster than I ever imagined. Within 3 years, I was running the biggest residential contractor in our entire county. Emma was so proud when she'd visit and see the signs with my company name all over town on new developments and renovations. Meanwhile, Katie remarried some hot shot finance guy named Brad. They bought this massive house in the most expensive neighborhood, drove matching luxury cars, joined the country club where her parents were members. Her family absolutely loved him. Finally, a son in law worthy of their social status, posted constant photos on social media of their perfect new blended family. Brad taking Emma to fancy restaurants, vacations to Europe, all the things they said I could never provide. Her parents would comment on every post about how blessed Katie was to find Real stability. Then last month, my phone rang at midnight on a Tuesday. It was Katie crying so hard I could barely understand her. There'd been a terrible accident. I had been drinking at some business dinner and decided to drive home with Emma in the passenger seat. They hit a massive oak tree going 60 miles per hour on a back country road. Brad walked away with bruises, but Emma was rushed to the children's hospital in critical condition with internal bleeding, a collapsed lung and severe head trauma. The medical bills were absolutely astronomical. Brad's insurance had apparently lapsed because he forgot to make payments and Katie's teacher salary couldn't cover even a time.

My first week at the coffee shop, I kept having to tell customers we couldn't make lattes or cappuccinos, so I did what nobody else would. Their faces would drop every single time, especially the regulars who just wanted their morning flat white or afternoon cortado. We could only make Americanos, drip coffee and cold brew anything that didn't require steamed milk. Steam wand had been broken for three weeks, according to my co workers, who just shrugged and said corporate was working on scheduling a technician. I used to fix equipment at my uncle's cafe all the time. Espresso machines and grinders, and even some commercial steamers. So when it was slow on a Wednesday afternoon, I decided to take a look at the LA Marzocco steam assembly. The manager, Derek, was off that day, and the shift supervisor told me to go for it if I thought I could help. The espresso machine itself worked fine. We could pull shots all day, but the steam wand was completely dead. Once I got the panels off, I found the issue. The steam valve had a blown gasket, and the pressure sensor was covered in old milk residue. Weeks of trying to force it had made things worse. I spent three hours taking apart just the steam assembly, replacing the gasket with one from our maintenance kit, and descaling everything with the approved cleaning solution. My Co workers started gathering around as I worked. Madison, who had been there three years, said she'd never seen anyone even try to fix it. Tyler started taking bets on whether I'd get it working. Even some customers at the counter were watching and cheering me on like I was performing surgery. One guy actually moved his laptop to a closer table just to watch the whole process unfold. When I finally got everything back together and. And the steam valve, the wand hissed to life with that familiar, powerful sound. I steamed a perfect pitcher of milk. Silky microphone with no big bubbles. Then I poured a Rosetta just to show off a little. The whole crew erupted in cheers and applause. Words spread fast through the neighborhood. They have lattes again. Customers who had been going to Starbucks came back for their usual drinks. We sold more cappuccinos and flat whites in two hours than the store had sold any coffee drinks all week. The line went out the door at one point. Everyone was so happy. Regulars were getting their proper drinks, and employees didn't have to explain anymore why a coffee shop couldn't make a latte. I felt like a hero, honestly. My co workers kept patting me on the back and saying I should get a raise. One older gentleman bought an extra cappuccino just to thank me for fixing it. The shift supervisor even let me take an extra break as a reward. Madison Started calling me the steam Wand Whisperer, which actually caught on with the rest of the crew. I went home that night feeling proud of taking initiative and solving a problem that had been plaguing the store. I even told my roommate about it, bragging about how I'd saved the day. The next morning, I walked in to find Derek waiting for me in the back office. He had this look on his face, like I'd burned down the building. Before I could even clock in, he handed me a termination notice dated two weeks out. I stood there confused, trying to understand what I was reading. You tampered with the lamarzocco, he said in this cold voice. I tried explaining that I only fixed the steam wand and customers were happy and we were selling lattes again. He cut me off and pulled out this thick contract. Turns out the coffee shop doesn't actually own those Lamarzocco machines. They lease them from the distributor with a

I was on my first tinder date ever. So excited to meet Julie. I didn't even know if she was real. But as I sat there, she finally walked in. I'm so sorry I was late. My mom was supposed to watch my daughter Liz. She's six. She sat down, and I could tell she was nervous. I had no idea she had a daughter. She asked if I was still okay with dating her, and I told her I was actually excited she had a kid because I'd always wanted to be a dad. She showed me a picture. She's been through a lot with a divorce and immediately changed the subject, like she revealed too much. We talked for two hours about everything except her family. And I noticed how she flinched every time her phone buzzed, glancing at it like it might explode. When I walked her to her car, she turned to me with this desperate look and said, if this goes somewhere, if we keep seeing each other, would you really be okay meeting Lizzie? I said, yes, of course. And she kissed me like she was drowning and I was air. I should have recognized that desperation. I should have known. Three weeks later, I got to meet her. I went over to their house, and as soon as she opened the door, I saw the sweetest girl ever. I could tell She was excited to meet me, too. We had dinner together. But I could tell she was more than nervous. I couldn't figure out what was wrong at the time. Then I started looking around. No kids artwork on the fridge. No toys anywhere. Just one school photo on the mantle. Like a museum piece. Julie was different, too. Talking too fast, drinking too much wine. Her phone lighting up every few minutes with mom on the screen. She kept rejecting the calls, each time, her hand shaking worse. When she went to the bathroom, I saw a text. If you answer your phone now, or I'm coming over. Julie came back with fresh lipstick, mascara slightly smudged. And when I asked if everything was okay, she kissed me so hard I tasted blood. Everything's perfect, she said. But her eyes were screaming. My phone rang at eleven PM on a Thursday. Unknown number. I almost didn't answer, but something made me pick up. David. The tiniest voice, barely a whisper. It's Lizzie. From. From Julie's house. My blood went cold. Lizzie, where are you? Where's your mom? There was a long pause, then. I'm at the hospital. The nurse let me use her phone. Mommy doesn't know I'm here. I was already grabbing my keys. Happened. Sweetheart. Another pause, and when she spoke again, I could hear her trying not to cry. She pushed me down the stairs. I drove like a maniac. This six year old girl calling Me, practically a stranger because she had nobody else. I found her sitting there at the hospital, and the nurse came and got me before I could say anything. She had suspected something was off. She insisted on calling you, she said quietly. Wouldn't let us call her mother. I sat with Lizzie while she told me everything. Years of hidden abuse. Julie's perfect mother act for the outside world. The threats, the careful injuries where bruises wouldn't show. How she'd Learned to hide the pain, to lie to teachers, to protect the mother who hurt her. She tells everyone I'm clumsy, Lizzie whispered. That I'm difficult. But I'm not difficult, am I? I held this brave little girl while she. I made her a promise. I'm going to make sure she never hurts you again. The police arrived within an hour, but Julie got there first. She burst in, playing the worried mother perfectly. Tears, trembling hands gathering Liz into a hug that made the girl go rigid with fear. My baby. I was so worried. I went to check on you when you were gone. The performance was flawless. When I tried to tell the officers what Liz had told me, Julie's face transformed. This man has been dating me for barely a month, she said, voice dripping concern. I think he's trying to come between me and my daughter. He's been asking strange questions about her. The officers exchanged looks. She called me. I insisted. Children say Things, Julie interrupted smoothly.

I was in science class when I grabbed what I thought was my granola bar from my bag. One bite and I knew something was wrong. The taste. Peanut butter. My friend's protein bar must have gotten mixed up with mine when we studied together. I need the emergency Epipen. I gasped, already feeling my throat tighten. I just ate peanuts. The substitute teacher looked up from her desk, where she was eating from her own bag of peanuts. Don't be dramatic. Allergies are all in your head. you don't understand. My tongue was already swelling. I left my Epipen at home, thinking I'd be fine since every classroom had emergency ones. Please, the med cabinet. Sit down. She stood up and walked to the cabinet, but instead of opening it, she leaned against it. You know what my parents did when I claimed I was allergic? The cats. They locked me in a room with three of them. By morning, I was cured. Katie jumped up and ran toward the cabinet. She's not faking. She needs help now. The sub blocked her. The only thing killing her is her own mind. Then she did something I'll never forget. She walked to the door, turned the dead bolt, and pocketed the key. No one leaves until she admits she's faking it. This victim mentality is destroying your generation. Call 9 1 1! Someone yelled, reaching for their Phone! Phones in the box. Now! The sub grabs the collection box, or you're all suspended. My throat felt like someone was tightening a belt around it. Six minutes. That's all I had before the swelling became irreversible. The number my doctor made me memorize. That's when my ex, Daniel, decided to chime in. She pulled the same drama last year. The sub smiled at him. See? Even he knows you're faking. She walked back to my desk with her bag of peanuts. My parents proved allergies are psychological. When I was five, she grabbed a handful and slowly, deliberately crushed them over my desk. Exposure therapy. This is for your own good. The dust fell everywhere. Blood started dripping from my nose. My lips were swelling. Katie screamed, look at her! The sub shoved Katie back down. Psychosomatic reaction. She believes she's dying, so her body mimics it. That's when Tommy touched his neck. And I guess he was allergic, too, because his eyes started swelling shut. I can't see! I can't see! Everyone lost it. Kids were dumping entire backpacks on the floor, throwing contents everywhere. Does anyone have an Epipen? Sarah was sobbing, using her shirt to wipe blood from my nose. Please don't die. Please don't die. Jack ran to the door and started pulling on it. Open this right now, please! The sub laughed. Sit down or you're expelled. Jack kept yanking on the door handle, the whole frame rattling. Help! Somebody! Other kids joined. Him pounding on the door with their fists. Through the door window, Mister Peterson from next door looked in. The sub stepped in front of the window, blocking his view, and gave a thumbs up before closing the blind. He walked away. This is kidnapping! Katie screamed. Three minutes left. Blood dripped from my nose onto my desk. Tommy was clawing at his throat. Lisa was in the corner, vomiting from pure panic. Two girls were huddled together, crying. Some kids just sat frozen at their desks, unable to move. The sub actually laughed. Oscar worthy performance, though a bit over the top with the fake blood. My situation ship. Jack tried to give me mouth to mouth while I was still conscious and choking. My ex, Daniel tackled him to the ground. I know her better. Yeah, that's why you called her dramatic. Jack shot back. Look at this. Fighting over the attention seeker. The sub ate another peanut. This is exactly what she wanted. I could feel myself turning blue. Foam bubbled at the corners of my mouth. Katie smashed the med cabinet with a chair. The sub grabbed her wrist. Destruction of property. That's expulsion. She's dying. Mike tackled the sub from behind. You wanna go to jail for assault? I'll press charges on all of you. I got out of my chair and couldn't even stand anymore. The fire extinguisher on the wall was my only thought. I literally had to crawl over on all fours. Just to get there. Look at her performance. The sub cackled, crawling for sympathy. My body didn't feel like it was mine anymore. One second I was getting ready to throw the fire extinguisher.

All of the men were given a blue balaclava on entering so it could all be masked, which kind of makes sense, but also at the same time makes knowing how many men that actually were very questionable. He for example said he did not sleep with her. He said he was LED to believe it was a one on one. It very much wasn't that. He was shy and just didn't feel comfortable. All this. Apparently there were people checking IDS on the door, but were they also checking STD test? And like, how could you be 100% sure the men would come In take off their clothes, stand in their box shorts in a big line and then whip them off.

So, like, um, fucking preventing the mail was punishable by death. And they had basically, like, special forces cops that were enforcing the safety of the US Postal Service. And it's just kind of trickled down. And now it's like, um, the big thing they do now is obviously making sure nobody's, like, mailing bombs or drugs through the mail. So, like, really important, but also, um, to preserve the US Postal Service. The US Postal Service has a legal monopoly on letters like normal mail. So this is why UPS and FedEx can't stick anything in your mailbox. They have to take it to your door. It's illegal for any entity other than the US Postal Service to put anything in your fucking mailbox.

And she was like, sure, but just don't look up. And I agree. But sure enough, while we were taking the bath, I looked up and I said, whoa, what are those? And she was like, those are just headlights. And then I looked down and I said, whoa, what is that? And she was like, already that's just a bush. Then the next day, my mom, I wasn't home, but I was scared to be alone. So I asked my dad if I could take a shower with him instead. My dad was like, okay, already, but just don't look up. And sure enough, when we got in there, I looked up and I said, whoa, what is that? Then he was like, already I told you not to look up, but that's just a snake. Then later on that night, I was trying to fall asleep but I got scared. So I walked out to my parents room and I knocked on the door and then I asked my parents, I was like, can I please sleep with you guys? I'm scared. And they were like, yeah, you can just make sure you don't look under the covers. That was so scared. I was like, okay, okay, I promise I won't. And then I jumped in the bed with them. But sure enough, like 10 To 15 minutes past and I'm starting to get really bored. So I look under the covers. I'm in complete shock. I start screaming. I'm like, ma, ma, turn on the headlights. The snake is in the bush. I repeat, the snake is in the bush.

Now, when the mom and the baby came back from the hospital, my family was invited over to see the baby. Problem is, I know that my little brother has no filter on him. So I pulled them over to the side to talk to him. I explained that the baby had no ears, and I told him, if you so much as mention the baby's ears, or matter of fact, if you even say the word ears, you'll be in a lot of trouble. That's what my brother was like. I understand. I promise I won't mention the baby's ears. We walk over to my neighbor's house, and we knock on the door. When she opens it up, she has the baby in this little stroller. Little brother goes to the stroller, he looks into it, and then he looks back up. He was like, wow, what a beautiful baby. And the mom was like, wow, thank you. And my little brother continued, he was like, wow, he has such cute little feet, cute little hands, a beautiful little nose, and some beautiful eyes. And he looked over at the mom, and he was like, is he able to see all right? And the mom so proud, she was like, yes. The doctor said that the baby will have perfect vision. For a brief little moment, I thought in my head, wow, I have such an Amazing little brother. But then he looked back at the mom and he was like, good, cause if he needed glasses he'd be fucked.

Turns out I got her pregnant. I was so scared to ruin my marriage. I told her to go back to Italy to have the baby. Told if you have it in Italy, I'll give you 25,000 up front and I'll pay child support every month until the kid is 18. She was skeptical at first, but eventually she agreed. But then she was like, but how would you know when the baby is born? And honestly, that was a good question. So I thought about it for a second. I was like, well, when a baby is born, send me a postcard and on the back of it write spaghetti. And I told, I said, once I received that postcard, I'll start sending the child support money. And one day, about nine months later, I come home to my confused wife. Soon as I walked in, she was like, already there's this weird postcard made out to you. And I was like, just give me it. I'll explain it later. And obviously she agreed. But when I read the card, I literally passed out. And I woke up three hours later in the hospital. When I woke up, I asked my wife if she, so I had the postcard with her. And she said yes. So I said, please give me that. I thought I was seeing things. But when I read the card again, now it Was serious. The card read, spaghetti, spaghetti, spaghetti, 2 with meatballs, 1 without send extra sauce.

Here's another list of things I find worthy of revolution number one the pink tax. One of the most highly requested ones in my comments. If you don't know what the pink tax is, it's essentially when corporations unnecessarily up charge on things like feminine hygiene products because they know that women have to have them. So they can charge them whatever they want, and women are gonna have to pay it because they have to have them. In other words, corporations extorting women on products they have to have in their life. Revolution No. 2 dental insurance not covering dental work. That's literally the whole point. Revolution number three paying taxes the entire year, but then somehow still owing taxes at the end of the year. But again, billionaires pay nothing. Revolution No. 4 insurance companies not covering hearing aids because it's not medically necessary. Um, how about you go six months without hearing and then we'll see if you feel like it's medically necessary? Revolution No. 5 politicians committing what the rest of the world considers war crimes against the American people and facing no consequences for that. Revolution No. 6 finding out that the Vietnam War was actually started over a lie which cost the lives of over 3 million people. And the government admitted that they lied about it, and literally no one faced consequences for that. Revolution No. 7 it's somehow being possible to fly to another country that has socialized healthcare to receive healthcare And it be cheaper than getting it here in America. That's insane. Revolution! Hi, my boy, my heat demand! What are you doing? What are you doing? As always, thank you guys so much for watching. Continue to put your reasons for revolution in the comments. I also want to thank you all for subscribing to my YouTube and my Twitch channel. I really appreciate that.

The company decided to put his theory to the test and they hired an 11 month old carrier pigeon named Winston to race their internet connection. Winston the pigeon had a 4 gigabyte USB stick tied to his back and was released from the Unlimited it office in Howick and told to fly to the unlimited it head office in Durban about 60 miles away. At the same time Winston the pigeon was released from the Hoick office, an employee began transferring the same files via their internet connection to the head office in Durban. It took Winston the pigeon one hour and eight minutes to fly to the Durban head office and another hour to.

The term first gained popularity with Gen Alpha when viewers of Twitch streamer your rage started using it in his chat to mock him, but then spread from there. It used to just be a general exclamation, but it was used so much in the context of explaining when you saw an attractive woman that in gen alpha slang it's come to mean just butt. A Rizzler is someone who has a lot of rizz, which means the ability to pick up women confidently or having a lot of game. It's believed to be a phonetic shortening of charisma. This term was also popularized by Twitch streamer Kai Cenat. And if you're wondering by the way, why it's Rizzler and not Rizzar, it's said to be by analogy with wiggler. Compare Wizard by analogy with Wizard. Skibidi is actually a nonsense word. Like it doesn't mean anything. Google Skibidi toilet if you really want to know, but trust me, it's not worth it. It was made by this guy as a total joke and it blew up randomly. Phantom Tax is named after Phantom, a content creator who's friends with Kai Cenat. When kaizen at streams, sometimes phantom will come into the room and take some of his food, and thus that was dubbed the Phantom tax. Finally, there's the idea of a Sigma, which is short for Sigma male. You know, the idea of an alpha male and a beta male. Well, people on the internet invented the idea of a Sigma male who was a lone wolf and went his own way and was above alpha males. It's kind of dumb. So what kind of lessons can we take away from this? Well

Compare that with the Latin alphabet, which is not a feudal writing system. There's nothing about the shape of L or t or n that indicates it should be pronounced as le or te or na. But that's not the case for Hangul. Take, for example, the letter N. In order to produce this sound, you have to lay your tongue flat and then curl the tip of it so it hits the ridge behind the back of your teeth. No? Well, in Hangul, the shape of the letter N is meant to imitate the position the tongue takes when producing the sound. The same goes for the letters K and G, by the way. You can see here the back of the tongue is raised to hit the back of the roof of the mouth, aka the velum, and that's exactly how you make the kuh and guh sounds. Just like in English, H is just a circle meant to represent open airflow through the throat, and this rectangular shape is supposed to emulate the shape your lips make when pressed together. This can be seen in consonants like muh, but, and but, coupled with some pretty simple strategies, such as an overline to Mark aspiration or constant doubling to Mark tenseness, as well as a relatively intuitive vowel System, you get yourself one of the easiest writing systems to learn and one of the coolest.

When Mike would harvest his carrot crops, up to 70% of the carrots he pulled out of the ground would go to waste because they were bent, broken or ugly. Mike hated his carrots going to waste. Mike's wife Terry hated cutting and peeling carrots when making dinner. And one night she told him, why can't you do something about this so I don't have to spend three hours every night chopping and peeling carrots? So Mike repurposed a bean cutting machine to chop the ugly carrots into 2 inch pieces. But customers told them they didn't want to cook with the carrots, they wanted to eat them as a snack. So Mike built a whole new factory where the ugly carrots were cut into 2 inch pieces, then peeled with a rough stone roller, then polished with a smooth stone roller and then put into bags. In 1986, bags of Bunny Love baby carrots hit grocery store shelves and were an instant hit in nine.

They're constantly told that their wife's happiness dictates the future of their marriage. On top of that, we have fun phrases like it's cheaper to keep her.

Alex Bowen snapped these selfies as he whipped up a late night snack at a Waffle House when no one was there to take his order. As soon as I walked around the bar to go to the back, I noticed one employee sleeping there on that bar. Um, you know, I looked at her for a few seconds, and I thought about waking her up, but then I said, you know, this employee is probably tired. I got you, fam. I'll take care of it. So he walked to the kitchen and cooked himself a giant Texas bacon cheese steak melt. It was 3:00am. He gobbled the meal down and then left the Waffle House in West Columbia, South Carolina. Waffle House only became aware of what happened when he posted these photos on social media. Waffle House management was not happy suspending the sleeping employee, but adding, obviously, Alex has some cooking skills, and we'd like to talk to him about a job since we may have something for him. They haven't formally offered me a job yet. Um, the district manager reached out to me after this occurred, and he said he would like maybe for me to be a secret shopper. By the way, Alex tells us he did go back the next day, and he paid for his meal.

He's putting a hose in it. That's gonna be ours. We picked up the trail of this alleged grease thief operating outside Chicago in broad daylight. He's prying up the edge. He's putting the hose in it. We told him as he made stop after stop to suck up grease. Have you been stealing grease all day long? No, no, no. We've been following you in your truck as you've gone behind restaurant after restaurant and are pumping out grease. He didn't have much to say. Sir, are you just a grease pirate going around stealing grease from people? No, sir. They stopped his truck and put him in cuffs.

Alex Bowen snapped these selfies as he whipped up a late night snack at a Waffle House when no one was there to take his order. As soon as I walked around the bar to go to the back, I noticed one employee sleeping there on that bar. Um, you know, I looked at her for a few seconds, and I thought about waking her up, but then I said, you know, this employee is probably tired. I got you, fam. I'll take care of it. So he walked to the kitchen and cooked himself a giant Texas bacon cheese steak melt. It was 3:00am. He gobbled the meal down and then left the Waffle House in West Columbia, South Carolina. Waffle House only became aware of what happened when he posted these photos on social media. Waffle House management was not happy suspending the sleeping employee, but adding, obviously, Alex has some cooking skills, and we'd like to talk to him about a job since we may have something for him. They haven't formally offered me a job yet. Um, the district manager reached out to me after this occurred, and he said he would like maybe for me to be a secret shopper. By the way, Alex tells us he did go back the next day, and he paid for his meal.

And one of those side hustles was teaching high school kids Spanish. And at first I'm thinking, you say Colombiano, you are Espanol. This is gonna be so easy. But as it turns out, I'm a terrible Spanish tutor. I had no idea what I was doing. I never actually had to learn Spanish. I'm a native speaker. So the kids would be like, I need to learn about grammar. And I'd be like, what the fuck is a comma? But because these soccer moms would offer me so much money, I couldn't just say no. So instead, I just got creative with my lesson plans. Two times a week, these soccer moms would drop off their sweet gringo babies at Panera Bread to learn Spanish from me. And two times a week, for an hour and a half, I would play one piece in Spanish the whole time. And before you're like, I can't believe you would rip off those sweet soccer moms. One of the best ways to learn a language is to watch a show in the language that you wanna learn. Honestly, it was such a great setup. I would get paid, I would get to watch one piece. The kids would learn. Kinda. Don't get me wrong, the kids were learning some Spanish. But my plan kind of backfired around test time, when the kids were, like, tested on certain topics. I Actually had to put an end to my tutoring sessions when one of the kids said in class that their favorite traditional Spanish dish was paella with devil fruits.

It's when you walk away from the one who stayed, the one who held space for you when you had no language for your pain, the one who poured into you while running on empty. Leaving loyalty isn't just a decision. It's a disconnection from the mirror that once reflected your worth back to you. It's like torching the bridge that carried you through your storm. You don't just lose them, you lose the version of you they help keep alive. We often confuse comfort with connection and sabotage safety because instability feels familiar.

No, no, no, Jesse. It's actually $40,000. And after taxes, they're taking home $33,135. So the take home pay is $2,761. The average one bedroom apartment in this country is 1713, plus $200 for utilities. The average American spending about $100 a week on groceries, so another $400 just to eat. So someone making $20 an hour in 2024 in the United States of America is left with $448 that they have to stretch for health insurance, car payment, car insurance, car maintenance, gas, cell phone, personal care, maybe child care, 4 O 1 k savings, miscellaneous, the list goes on. But we're talking about $20 for a fast food worker. While as of May 1st, 2024, Zip recruiter said the entry level college grads United States are making $23 an hour. So let's run the numbers for them there. Take home pay would be 31, 35 - 17, 13 for rent, 200 for utilities, 400 for groceries. And because they went to college, the average loan payment for a bachelor's degree is about $512. So a college graduate making $23 an hour in 2024 in this country is left with $310 to you for health insurance, car and everything else that I listed. So for people like Jesse, for the politicians, for the celebrities, for the elites, for the top one percent who are out of touch with everyday Americans and especially our youth, $20 an hour is not a hundred grand. In fact, $20 an hour, people can barely survive in 2024.

In the past. It used to be that a loss would drop you a lot of spots and it would be tough to come back from. This year, it doesn't seem like the case so much. Good example of that is Oregon. I think if Oregon was undefeated right now, they would be the No. 2 team in the country, maybe the No. 1, but they'd probably be No. 2 just behind Georgia in these rankings. So if an undefeated Oregon team is No. 2 and an Oregon team in real life that lost to Stanford is No. 4, then losing to that unranked Stanford team only dropped them two spots. Now, that's not me hating on Oregon. If they went out, they deserve to be in. But you can't tell me that losing to an unranked team only dropping you two spots is normal. Or look at Alabama and Michigan State. Michigan State is an undefeated Power 5 team with the top 10 win and they're still not ranked over a one loss, Alabama. Now, the reason why I think they're doing this is because the two teams that they don't wanna let in are Wake Forest if they go undefeated and Cincinnati if they go undefeated. The committee doesn't really want either of those teams to be in the.

Yeah. What is that? The Genesis came from Jordan playing Madden when we were doing our pilot. Um, we were working and out of his apartment and he was really obsessed with Madden at the time.

And then I go, and then I go to BRIC Shawn Ferguson. That guy, that guy is the tip of the iceberg. I said, wait till you see some of these college guys names. Yes. And it was his idea. So then I had said to him, when I said, I don't know if you know, but in professional games when they introduce the lineups for the players. They'll, you know, they'll do that, like the little shot of the bust of the guy and the guy will say is name. He'll say, you know, what position he plays and what school he went to.

Cause I thought Kadarius Tony was gonna be a superstar. Especially when he had that one game in his rookie season where he put up 200 yards against the Cowboys. And even looking back at it now, his movement skills playing receiver were just different. Cause who in their right mind even attempts a juke move like this? And unfortunately for Tony, his main concerns were always off the field issues. Not being able to stay healthy and catching the damn football. Cause if you look back at his most recent season in Kansas City, it was a mess. And it felt like every single interception that Patrick Mahomes threw was his fault. And you have to think any confidence he might have had left at this point is already in the gutter. Cause now Kadarius is a free agent and who knows if any team is willing to take a chance on him. Cause while I do think he has a lot of talent in which he's already displayed in the NFL, I think he also has way too much baggage to go along with that. To whoever made this graphic, by the way, you're a complete savage. Three years $9 per hour? Damn.

And this guy really fucking put DeMar Hamlin. And for context as to what AB is referring to, obviously, we all know that DeMar Hamlin almost died on the field against the Bengals. So of course, there's a insane conspiracy theory that went around that I obviously do not believe that DeMar Hamlin actually died that day and the guy representing him now is like a clone or something. So DeMar answered Antonio Brown back by saying, I pray god don't ever let me turn into a burnt old head like you. I used to look up to you damn near shit sad. For real, talk about a clone, bring back the real AB. Hamlin even exposed brown by showing how he never answers his DMS, calling him a weirdo and putting the hashtag pray for AB with a clown emoji. And I'm sure we could all agree that if you guys have kept up with Antonio Brown's Twitter account, sure, it could be for entertainment, but the guy is still off the rails. And Antonio answered back by basically saying that his therapist told him that NFL players have low self esteem and that they're weak. And I get that Antonio Brown is probably doing This for clicks and views. But I think we can again all agree that this shit is pretty low.

He doesn't allow you to disrespect him or allow her to lean on the habits that others have overlooked simply because they were too afraid to challenge her. She might be used to getting her way, confident that someone will eventually let it pass, but not him. He's been down this road before and he's felt the sting of compromising his standards and vowed to never, ever feel this way ever again. In today's world, boundaries and standards are buzzwords often spoken about but rarely respected, especially when it comes to men. It's almost as if we aren't allowed to have them. As if I.

So apparently asking for extra napkins makes me a sexual predator. Let me explain. I'm at this burger joint downtown, the kind of place where the grease has its own grease and the floor makes sounds when you walk. I order my usual double cheeseburger, fries and a Coke that's 90% ice. Standard Tuesday depression meal. The cashier's this girl, maybe early 20s, blonde highlights, name tag says Brittany. I pay, get my number and sit down to wait. Normal human interaction, zero flirting detected. My food comes out and immediately I know there's a problem. This burger is a crime scene. Sauce is leaking everywhere like it's trying to escape. The fries are drowning in grease. I need napkin. Lots of napkins. So I walk back to the counter. Britney's there looking bored, scrolling through her phone like she's searching for the meaning of life and TikTok comments. Hey, I say politely, could I get some extra napkins? This burger's a little messy. She looks up and I swear something shifts in her eyes like a switch flipped from customer service mode to full alert. Extra napkins, she repeats, like I just asked for her Social Security number. Yeah, just a few more. Thanks. She hands me exactly three napkins. Britney, I need more than three napkins. This burger could lubricate a semi truck. Could I maybe get a few more? That's when it happened. She leans Back crosses her arms and says loud enough for the entire restaurant to hear, I have a boyfriend. I blink, okay, I just need napkins. She rolls her eyes. Right, napkin? Sure. Now I'm confused. I'm sorry. What's happening right now? Britney sighs dramatically like I'm the dumbest person she's ever encountered. Look, you're cute and all, but I'm not interest.

My college roommate thought he could cheat his way through our final creative writing assignment by stealing a story from some obscure author. But he picked the worst possible person to plagiarize from. had been coasting through Professor Williams's creative writing class all semester while I actually worked on my stories. He'd submit these half hearted pieces at the last minute and somehow still pass with C is. The final assignment was worth 50% of our grade. Write a 10 page original short story. We had six weeks to complete it. I spent countless hours crafting mine, going through multiple drafts and getting feedback from the writing center. Matt, predictably, I waited until the night before it was due. I found him frantically searching online for something to copy. There's gotta be some story I can steal that the professor won't recognize, he muttered, scrolling through random websites. Matt, just write something. Anything original is better than plagiarizing. Dude, I don't have time. Besides, Williams is like 60 years old. She probably doesn't even know how to use Google. Around 2:00am, I found what he was looking for. Perfect. This story called The Last Train Home by some author named E. M. Williams. It's exactly 10 pages and it's beautiful. No way our professor has read this. I glanced at his screen. The story was indeed well written, published on what looked like a small literary magazine website. Matt That seems risky. Relax. It's from 1987. Professor Williams would never find this random story from 30 years ago. He copied the entire story, changed the font and printed it out.

I was swiping through tinder on my friend's phone as a joke when I saw my dad shirtless holding our dog with the caption, just a suburban dad looking for something real. I started laughing at until I realized it was really him. Same backyard, same stupid grill in the background, same I'm dog I walked every day after school. I froze, hoping it was an old profile. Then I scrolled once more and my blood ran cold. My mom was on there too. Different profile, same app, different bio. Still got it. Just looking for someone who knows how to keep up. I stared at the screen like it was glitching. There's no way both my parents were cheating on each other using the same app. I couldn't even speak. I made an excuse at my friend's house and by tone like my life depended on it. At dinner that night, they were laughing together like nothing was wrong, joking about some Netflix show, pouring wine, sharing food. I watched them like a stranger. Were they both cheating and didn't know the other was too? Or were they, god no, doing it together that night? I barely slept. Next morning, I asked if I could talk to them. It's important, I said. My mom sat down first. My dad followed, looking like he already knew what this was. I pulled out my phone. Why are you both on tinder? Silence. Then My mom sighed. We were going to tell you after graduation.

So I showed up with his ex and a microphone. He asked me to prom in front of the whole cafeteria with a glittery sign and the entire soccer team cheering. And I said yes, not knowing it was all a dare. Jason was everyone's dream guy. Captain of the team, perfect smile, and apparently a great actor. We were lab partners. He laughed at my jokes, complimented my drawings, even brought me coffee. So when he popped the question with a rose in his hand, I thought I was finally seen. I told my mom I bought a dress. I let myself be happy. Then two days later, I got a DM from his ex, live. You seem cool. You deserve to know. She sent a screen recording. Jason in a group chat saying, bet I can take goth girl to prom. One dance, one pick. Fifty bucks. I felt my stomach drop. Every moment suddenly felt rotten. But instead of crying, I called live. Want to help me ruin his night? She didn't hesitate. Prom night, I wore black velvet and fury. Live wore red and revenge. We walked in together and Jason's face twisted. Before he could speak, I the mic. Thanks for the sweet proposal, Jason. Too bad it was a dare. Gasps silence. Here's the chat where he made the bet, I said, holding up my phone. Live took the mic. Next. And I'm the ex. He cheated on twice. Phones were out. Jason stuttered, then stormed out. We danced all night while the crowd cheered us on. By Monday, the video had gone viral. Jason deleted everything. I didn't get prom queen, but I got the final word.

Design a complete marketing campaign for real local business, including market research, strategy, budget, and a presentation to actual executives. Tyler immediately started making excuses. I'm pledging a fraternity so I'll be pretty busy. You guys got this right. Our group of 5 quickly became a group of four. Tyler would skip every meeting, ignore our group texts and show up to class acting like everything was fine. When we confronted him, he'd say, relax, I'll help with the presentation. That's the most important part anyway. Meanwhile, we spent three months doing actual work. Market surveys, competitor analysis, budget spreadsheets, graphic design for mockups. Sarah stayed up until 2:00am creating the Powerpoint. Mike interviewed 20 potential customers. I spent my weekends researching industry trends. Tyler contributed exactly nothing but kept saying, this is going to be so easy. Professor Martinez loves me. Two weeks before the presentation, Tyler finally asked to see what we've done. Wow, you guys went all out, he said, scrolling through our 47 slide presentation. This is definitely an a. Can't wait to present this. That's Sarah had a brilliant idea. Tyler, since you're so confident about the presentation part, why don't you Handle the whole thing. You said it's the most important part. Tyler's eyes lit up. Really? Yeah, I can totally do that. I'm great at presentations. Perfect. Sarah said we'll email.

Some had been waiting since they saw the email. At 6 a. M. Blake called everyone begging them to come in. Four agreed even though it was their day off. At 11 Greece, we opened the doors.

When my son was 8, he begged me for a dog every single day. I was exhausted, single mom, two jobs, just trying to stay afloat. I didn't have the time, energy or money to entertain the idea. One night, half joking and fully fed up, I snapped and said, fine, if you can save up $500 to cover the first year of expenses, I'll get you a dog. I figured he'd forget about it in a week. He didn't. This kid got to work immediately, started collecting soda cans from neighbor's recycling bins. So hold his Pokemon cards, did every odd chore he could find for $1 here, $2 there. Every few weeks he dump his piggy bank on my bed and count his money out loud. 47, $52, 63. At first I thought it was cute. He'd wake up early on weekends to search the park for bottles, made flyers asking if neighbors had any small jobs. I started to feel a little guilty. Their kids were spending their allowances on candy and video games. My son was saving every single penny. Honey, I said once, you sure you don't want to spend a little? Maybe buy yourself a cool toy. He shook his head, I want a dog more than anything, mom. His dedication was next level. At the school book fair, while other kids were excitedly buying new books, he just walked around with his hands. In his pockets when Halloween came instead of use.

My boyfriend Marcus started acting shady three months ago. Every Tuesday night, he'd disappear from 7 to 10 p m. When I asked where he went, he'd get weird about it. Just meeting some people, he'd mumble, avoiding eye contact. His phone started buzzing with reminders. Don't forget tonight and see you at 7:30. I checked his browser history. He been googling things like how to get better fast and practice makes perfect. My mind went to the worst places. Then I started noticing other weird things. He'd come home on Tuesdays smelling like cheap coffee and erasers. His hands would have ink stain. When I asked about it, he'd quickly wash them and change the subject. One night, I found a pencil behind his ear that he'd forgotten about. When I pointed it out, he looked panicked. Oh, that's from work. He lied badly. But Marcus worked construction. He used pens for paperwork, pencils. I also noticed he'd been buying notebooks. Lots of them. I found three brand new composition books hidden in his truck's glove compartment. When I confronted him about them, he said they were for keeping track of work stuff, but the pages were blank. His behavior was getting more suspicious by the day. He'd practice writing his signature over and over on random scraps of paper, then quickly throw them away when he thought I wasn't looking.

This woman brought her untrained golden retriever into a restaurant claiming it was a service dog. But she made the mistake of sitting next to someone who actually trained service animals for a living. I was having lunch at Olive Garden when this woman walked in with a beautiful golden retriever wearing a bright red service dog vest she clearly bought online. The hostess looked uncertain but seated them anyway. Right away, I could tell something was off. The dog was pulling on its leash, sniffing other customers food and whining loudly. Real service dogs are trained to be practically invisible in public. The woman who will call Karen was making a huge show of her disability. She kept talking loudly about how her medical condition required her service dog's constant presence. He alerts me to my episode, she announced to nearby tables. I could literally die without him. Meanwhile, the dog was begging for food from strangers, barking at the bus boy and trying to jump on other customers. Karen did nothing to control him. A woman sitting at the table next to them watched this circus with growing concern. She was quietly eating with her own dog, perfectly behaved German Shepherd wearing a legitimate service dog harness who hadn't moved an inch since they sat down. When Karen's dog started pawing at the German Shepherd trying to get him to play, the woman finally spoke up. Excuse Me. But your dog seems very distracted. Is he having an off day? Karen got defensive immediately. Rex is perfectly trained. He's a certified service dog. I.

Twelve years into my marriage with Emma, I was helping her clean out our basement when I found an old college notebook stuffed in a cardboard box. The pages were yellowed and filled with her messy handwriting from economics classes. I was about to toss it when a folded letter fell out. The date made my stomach drop. Two months before our wedding. It was addressed to someone named Jake. I should have put it back immediately, but seeing my wife's handwriting talking about our upcoming wedding made me curious. What I read next changed everything. Jake. I keep thinking about that night. We talked until 4 a m. About moving to Portland together. Tomorrow. I'm supposed to finalize the wedding menu. But all I can think about is what you said about following dreams instead of safe choices. I love him. I really do. He's kind and stable and everything my mom wants for me. When I imagine our life together, it feels like I'm watching someone else's movie. With you, I felt like the main character in my own story. I know you're seeing someone new now, and maybe that's for the best. But if I ever read this letter again years from now, I'll know I settled. I'm scared I'm making the biggest mistake of my life.

I work the 5:00am shift at a gas station in the middle of nowhere, Montana. It's one of those places where truckers stop for coffee and locals grab energy drinks on their way to work. Most mornings it's dead quiet until around 7. This one Tuesday morning in March, this guy walks in wearing this massive winter coat, hood pulled up, hands shaking from the cold. He looked exhausted, like he'd been driving all night. Go straight to the coffee machine and just stands there staring at it. Excuse me. Is this fresh? He asks, pointing at the pot. I had to break it to him that it was from last night and probably tasted like burned rubber. The new pot wouldn't be ready for another 10 minutes. He looked so disappointed. I felt bad for the guy. He seemed really stressed about something. So I grabbed a Styrofoam cup, filled it with hot water from the dispenser and handed him one of those fancy tea bags we keep behind the counter. It's chamomile, I said. My mom always said it helps when you're having a rough day. He just stared at the cup for a second, then smiled. First real smile I'd seen from him while I was prepping the breakfast sandwiches for the morning rush. He sat at one of our little tables and we started chatting. He asked about living in a small town, if I Liked it here. I told him honestly that it was tough since my husband got sick last year. Medical bills were crush.

Everyone at school thought Leo was the funniest kid alive. He'd walk into first period doing this perfect impression of Mister Watson trying to reach the top shelf in the supply closet, complete with the little grunting sounds. The whole class would lose it. During lunch, Leo would tell these crazy stories about his weekend adventures, like the time he supposedly convinced a McDonald's worker he was conducting a French fry quality inspection and got free food for an hour. Even the quiet kids would crack up. Teachers couldn't stay mad at him when he got caught putting googly eyes on every calculator in math class. Missus Chang just sighed and handed him a detention slip while trying not to smile. But here's the thing, nobody noticed. Leo never talked about home, ever. One Tuesday, we got this substitute teacher who clearly didn't know our class. She gave us this writing assignment. What do you wish people knew about you? Everyone groaned and wrote generic stuff about wanting to be famous or whatever. But Leo actually seemed focused. He was writing for like 20 minutes straight, which was weird because he usually just drew little cartoons in the margins. Then the sub did something that still makes my stomach drop. She started reading papers out loud, thinking they were all anonymous.

I noticed bruises on Sarah's arms, partially covered by her dress sleeves. She slipped a folded paper into my dress pocket while hugging me, saying, Mommy wrote you a letter. I signaled my character attendant using our emergency code word. Within minutes, security was quietly monitoring the situation. I kept Sarah talking about her favorite Disney movies while reading the note hidden behind my autograph book. That was from her mother, explaining that her ex husband had violated their custody agreement and taken Sarah from school without permission. There was a restraining order against him.

If you were under 16, your door stayed unlocked. Even the bathroom had this weird sliding thing my dad could open with a quarter. I thought it was the dumbest rule ever. My sister Emma got her lock the day she turned 16 and literally rubbed it in my face. Every chance she got, he'd slam her door and yell through it, guess what? I'm locked in! Like it was some huge victory. My dad always said the same thing when I complained. Locks are for people who can handle responsibility. You'll understand when you're older. Which just made me matter, because that's what adults say when they can't give you a real answer. Everyone at school thought my parents were control freaks. When I told my friend Jake about it, he was like, dude, that's insane. What if you're changing? I just shrug and say, I change really fast. But the truth is, I was embarrassed.

I order a simple cappuccino. Nothing crazy, no oat milk, no extra shots, no interpretive dance on top, just caffeine in a cup so I can pretend to be a functioning adult. The barista, let's call her Luna because of course that's her name, makes my drink with the intensity of someone performing surgery. She's got this little metal pitcher steaming milk like she's summoning spirits. Takes her a solid five minutes to create what I can only describe as the Mona Lisa of foam art. She slides across the counter with this proud smile and goes, I made you a swan. I look down, it's beautiful. Beautiful, like genuinely impressive. This foam swan is sitting there looking more elegant than I've ever looked in my entire life. I'm genuinely appreciative. So I say, oh, wow, that's really cool. Thanks. And Luna's face just drops like I told her my dog died. She blinks twice and goes, cool. I pause mid Sip. Yeah, it's, it's really well done. She crosses her arms. I spent six years perfecting latte art. This isn't cool. This is craft, ma'am. I said it was cool because I think it's impressive. That's, that's a compliment. But Luna's not having it. She turns to her coworker.

I called my mom, my sister and three neighbors. Nobody could babysit. Daycare wouldn't take him with a fever. With trembling fingers, I dialed Mr Grayson's direct line. Sir, I'm so sorry, but my son is really sick and I, the Keller presentation is in three hours. Andrea, his voice was cold. They're bringing five potential investors. Do you understand what's at stake? Yes, but we've been preparing for weeks. Your section is critical. I know, but he has no one else. There's always a solution that doesn't involve missing work.

In my family, it was the yearly Penance Day. It started with my great grandfather, a deeply religious man who believed in public confession of sins. Every December 29th, the entire extended family would gather in my grandparents living room for what can only be described as emotional torture. I was 12, the first time I was deemed old enough to participate. Before then, I'd been sent upstairs with the other kids, hearing only muffled crying and occasional shouts from below. James, it's your turn this year, my father said that morning, his eyes not quite meeting mine. It's part of becoming a man in this family. I remember the pit in my stomach as we drove to Grandpa's house. What exactly do I have to do, I asked. Dad's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. Let's be honest, that's all they want. They, the elders, your grandfather, your uncles and me. When we arrived, the house already felt heavy. The adults sat in a circle of chairs in the living room while the younger kids were herded upstairs by my aunt. The Christmas decorations still hung, making the somber atmosphere even more unsettling. Grandpa stood at the center, Bible in hand. We gather to cleanse ourselves.

I'm not a fitness guy. I'm the guy who gets winded walking upstairs and considers opening a pickle jar cardio. But my doctor said I need exercise, so I joined Planet Fitness because they have pizza Fridays and purple equipment that looks less intimidating. My first week, I'm on the elliptical, dying slowly when this older guy next to me starts struggling. He's probably 70, sweating, looking like he might need medical attention. You got this, man. Tell him just keep moving. He smiles, keeps going, finishes his workout. Feels good to help. Next day, same time, same elliptical. The older guy, let's call him Bob, waves me over my motivation buddy says yesterday was my best workout in months. Motivation buddy? Sir, I was just trying not to watch you have a heart attack. Bob introduces me to his friend Margaret. This is the young man I told you about. Real inspiring. Margaret, who's maybe 65 and could probably bench press me, nods approvingly. We need more positive energy in this place. By day three, Bob and Margaret are bringing friends. There's now a small group of seniors gathering around my elliptical like I'm about to deliver a TED talk. What's today's motivation? Asks a woman named Doris. I panic. Uh, keep your heart rate up. They all nod like I just shared Ancient Wisdom. Week 2, the group has doubled. They're calling themselves the Elliptical Eagles. Someone made T shirts. Bob appointed himself my workout coordinator. Should we do the chant? Bob asks. There's a chant now? We are strong. We are fear.

I was having lunch at Olive Garden when this woman walked in with a beautiful golden retriever wearing a bright red service dog vest she clearly bought online. The hostess looked uncertain, but seated them anyway. Right away, I could tell something was off. The dog was pulling on its leash, sniffing other customers food, and whining loudly. Real service dogs are trained to be practically invisible in public. The woman who will call Karen was making a huge show of her disability. She kept talking loudly about how her medical condition required her service dog's constant presence. He alerts me to my episode, she announced to nearby tables. I could literally die without him. Meanwhile, the dog was begging for food from strangers, barking at the bus boy, and trying to jump on other customers. Karen did nothing to control him. A woman sitting at the table next to them watched this circus with growing concern. She was quietly eating with her own dog.

She names her car, talks to plants, stuffed animals like sentient beings. I think it's just quirky girlfriend behavior. Everyone has their thing, right? Some collect vinyl. Others have relationships with objects. But then it escalates. Emma starts getting upset when I don't acknowledge her possession. You didn't say hi to Mr Whiskers. You'll say when I walk into her room, Mr Whiskers is a teddy bear. A teddy bear that apparently requires social interaction. Hey, Mr Whiskers, I'd say feeling ridiculous but trying to be supportive. You're not making eye contact with a stuffed animal that has button eyes. Then she starts critiquing how I interact with my stuff. You're really rough with your laptop, she says, watching me close it. Normally I closed it, but you didn't thank it for its service today. It's a computer, Emma. It doesn't have feelings. She gasps. Like I just said something deeply offensive. Everything has energy. You're being dismissive of your laptop's contribution to your day. My laptop's contribution, which is existing and occasionally working during zoom calls. But the breaking point comes during a dinner I cooked for her. I'm making pasta, nothing fancy, just trying not to poison us both. The smoke alarm goes Off apparently incapable of cooking without creating minor disasters. I reach up and press the button to turn it off. Emma looks horrified. You didn't apologize to who? The smoke alarm. You just silenced it without acknowledging.

That's exactly the issue, she says, getting louder. You're mansplaining your own work instead of creating space for women's voices. how do I mansplain something I created that's just called explaining? But she's not done. You clearly took over the project and sidelined your female group members. Classic patriarchal behavior. I look at my group members. Sarah, who showed up to one meeting and contributed the phrase sounds good. Jessica, who volunteered to handle social media and never mentioned it again. They had equal opportunity to contribute. I say carefully, equal opportunity isn't equal outcome. Madison fires back like she's Quoting her gender studies text.

Don't worry, kiddo, you're coming home with me, he said at the funeral. Your parents would want that. Moving in with Jake felt like the one good thing in the worst time of my life. He had this big house with a pool table in the basement. He let me eat cereal for dinner and didn't care if I stayed up late. My friends thought I was lucky. Your mom and dad were smart, Jake told me one night while we watch TV. They set up a college fund for you. Real good chunk of money. They wanted to make sure you could go anywhere you wanted. That made me feel better. Even though they were gone, they'd still taken care of me. Three years passed, Jake kept mentioning the college fund whenever I worried about paying for school. Don't stress about applications. Em money is not gonna be an issue. The week I turned 18, I asked to see the account. Just wanted to know how much was there, maybe start planning. Jake's whole face changed. Got this Weird look. And started cleaning his already clean coffee mug. Well, the thing is that money isn't really available anymore. What do you mean not available? I had to use it. House repairs, your food, clothes, all that stuff. Raising a kid is expensive. Emily. My stomach dropped. You used my college money. It went toward taking care of you.

I caught this teenager shoplifting a pack of insulin pens from the pharmacy. Kid couldn't have been older than 16, stuffing them in his backpack when he thought nobody was looking. Store manager called us immediately demanding we arrest him for. When I found the kid hiding behind the dumpster in the parking lot, he was crying and begging me not to call his parents. His hands were shaking as he pulled out this crumpled prescription bottle with his name on it. He kept saying, please, officer, I just needed my medicine. I can't afford it and I'm supposed to take it every day. I noticed the prescription date was from 3 months ago. This kid had been without insulin for weeks. When I asked why he didn't just ask his parents for help, his face went pale. He whispers that his dad lost his job two months ago and they lost their health insurance. His parents don't even know he's been skipping doses. The store manager comes storming out, yelling about teenage thieves and wanting to press full charges. He's in his expensive suit telling me this kid needs to learn consequences. This isn't the first time. Store cameras caught him. Last week, putting the pens back because a customer walked by. My supervisor shows up for the juvenile arrest protocol. He recognizes the kid's last name from the address. We've been getting domestic Disturbance calls from this neighborhood. The supervisor.

Every morning before school, Zara had to stand in front of a mirror and say I'm worthless 10 times. Her mom said it would keep her humble and motivated to work harder. I thought she was joking when she first told me. Then I slept over and heard it myself through the bathroom door. 10 times, perfectly clear, I'm worthless. I'm worthless, I'm worthless. Zara was the smartest kid in our class but never raised her hand. She'd get perfect test scores, then throw them away because she said she didn't deserve good grades. When teachers praised her work, she'd actually flinch like someone hit her. She won the science fair three years straight but told everyone it was just luck. Boys asked her to dances, but she always said no. She'd say, why would they wanna be around someone worthless? Kai Brennan, the most popular guy in school, asked her to prom. She literally ran away crying. Her mom started adding new rules. If Zara smiled too much, she had to say it 15 times. If she laughed loudly, 20 times. If she got an a on a test 25 times. Because pride comes. Before the fall, she stopped eating lunch with us, said worthless people didn't deserve friend time. She quit the debate team even though she was captain, dropped out of student council, rejected the valedictorian nomination. I watched her grades tank on purpose. She Deliberately get questions wrong on tests. Failed her.

Growing up, Sunday mornings were sacred, just me and dad fishing it on, watching light break over Crystal Lake. He'd always say the same thing while baiting our hooks, the smallest fish make the biggest splash, kiddo. I thought it was just another dad saying. I was 12 when I first found the photo hidden in his wallet, crumpled at the edges, a young woman cradling twin babies in a hospital bed. When I asked mom about it, she went hail, said she'd never seen it. The next day, Dad's wallet mysteriously here. But the strange things kept stacking up. Dad refusing to let me get blood work done when I got sick. Him practically running out of hospitals whenever we visited relatives. The way his hands would shake when he saw identical twin in public. Mom started noticing, too. The weirdest part, even after we moved three hours away, he still insisted on driving to that same lake every Sunday. Not any other lake, that one. When I asked why, he'd just say it was our spot and change the subject. Last month, a woman showed up at our door clutching that exact photo. Dad's face turned ghost white. She looked just like the woman in the picture, only 25 years older. Mom was at work 25 years, she whispered, tears streaming down her face. 20, five years of visiting two tiny babes, the truth spilled out. Like blood and water. Dad was an obsessed medical intern who stole a twin, faked our death and disappeared. That lake where we bished, that's where he first saw my real mother, seven months pregnant with the twins he would tear apart. Yesterday, I met my sister. She has my laugh. Dad's in jail.

When I was 8, my dad sat me down and told me that my mom had abandoned us. That she didn't love me enough to stay. He spent the next 10 years drilling into my head that she was a selfish woman who chose partying over her own son. I believed him completely. Every birthday, every Christmas, every school event where other kids mom showed up, I feel this burning anger thinking about how she chose a wild lifestyle over being there for me. Dad would always say things like, at least you have me, buddy. I'll never leave you like she did. Looking back, I should have noticed the red flags. Like how he'd get weirdly tense whenever I asked about her. Or how he'd throw away any mail that came from her side of the family. But I was just a kid who trusted his father completely. Then came my high school graduation. I was valedictorian. And as I stood at the podium giving my speech, I noticed this woman in the back of the auditorium. She was crying, but trying to hide it behind her hand. Something about her seemed familiar, but I couldn't place it. After the ceremony, while everyone was taking pictures, she approached me. Before she could say anything, my dad appeared out of nowhere and stepped between us. Nancy, you need to leave, he said in a voice. I'd never heard him use before. That's when it hit me.

This was my first real call involving a gun. The pharmacy was one of those old corner stores that's been there forever. Missus Park behind the counter looked terrified but unharmed. She pointed toward the back aisle where this tiny kid was standing with what looked like a pistol. The suspect was maybe 13 years old, skinny as a rail, wearing a hoodie three sizes too big. His hands were trembling worse than mine. I drew my weapon and called out standard commands. The kid immediately dropped what he was holding and put his hands up. That's when I saw the gun was fake, wooden block painted black with a marker. Looked real from a distance, but up close, it was obviously homemade. The craftsmanship was actually pretty good for a kid. This is. Park told me the weirdest part, he didn't take money or snacks or anything valuable, just grabbed one thing from behind the pharmacy counter, a box of insulin pens that.

My music teacher, Mr. Reynolds, absolutely hated me for playing piano the wrong way. I taught myself to play by ear when I was eight. My mom couldn't afford lessons, so I just listened to songs and figured them out. I'd watch YouTube too. Memories and practice for hours. By high school, I could hear a song once and play it back almost perfectly. Not from sheet music, just by listening. First day of music class, Mister Reynolds asked if anyone could play. I raised my hand, sat at the piano, and played a cold play song I'd Learned that week. When I finished, instead of being impressed, he frowned. Where's your sheet music? I don't use any. I play by ear. His face turned sour. That's. It's not how music works. Anyone can bang keys randomly. Real musicians read notes. I tried explaining I wasn't random. I knew chord progressions and music theory from YouTube. Cut me off. In my class, we follow proper technique. If you can't read music, you can't play. For weeks he'd force me to struggle through beginner sheet music while ignoring that I could already play advanced songs by ear. He'd Mark me down for improper fingering, even though the music sounded perfect. The worst part was during practice sessions.

My buddy Dave thought he could rig our 500 dollar fantasy football league by secretly managing his girlfriend's team. But he forgot one crucial detail that completely exposed his scheme. Our fantasy league had been running for 8 years with the same group of guys. Everyone puts in 50 dollars. Winner takes 400 dollars, second place gets 100 dollars. It's serious business. We have a draft party weekly, trash talk, the whole nine yards. This year, Dave shows up to the draft with his new girlfriend, Emma. She wants to join the league, he announces. She's really into football. Emma seemed nice enough, but during the draft, something felt off. Every time it was her turn to pick, she'd look at Dave, who'd whisper something in her ear. Then she'd make her selection. I'm still learning all the player names, she'd say apologetically after Dave told her to draft someone. We figured Dave was just helping her get started. No big deal. But as the season progressed, Emma's team was dominant, like suspiciously dominant. She was making perfect waiver wire pickups, starting the right players every week, and somehow always knew when to bench someone before they had a bad game. Her team name was Emma's Angels, her lineup decisions were more strategic than most of us could manage. After years of experience, the real red flag came in Week 6. Emma's team needed a kicker and There were several decent options available during our group chat, where we usually discuss moves. Emma posted, thinking about picking up Harrison Butler. Dave thinks he has a good match this week. Five minutes later, Dave posted in the same chat.

My coworker Derek kept microwaving fish in the break room every single day, despite multiple people asking him to stop. The smell was so bad that clients would comment on it when they visited our office. Eric worked in accounting, two cubicles over from me. Every day at exactly 12:15, he'd walk to the break room with his Tupperware container of leftover salmon, cod, or whatever fish he'd made the night before. The microwave was ancient and had no ventilation, so the smell would linger for hours. Our office manager, Linda, had sent multiple emails about appropriate breakroom etiquette and being considerate of shared spaces. Derek would just reply with sarcastic responses about food shaming and how he was eating healthy while everyone else lived on junk food. The breaking point came during our biggest client presentation of the year. Mr. Peterson from Peterson industries was touring our office before signing a two million dollar contract. We spent weeks parenting, cleaned everything, bought fresh flowers for the reception area. Right as we were walking Mister Peterson through the office, Derek heated up his daily fish lunch. The smell hit us like a wall of rotting ocean. Mister Peterson actually stopped mid sentence and wrinkled his nose. Is there a plumbing issue? He asked politely. I watched our CEO's face turn red with embarrassment as he tried to explain that it was just someone's lunch. Mr. Peterson cut the meeting short, saying, He'd think about the contract. We lost the deal. Derek didn't care. Not my problem. People can't handle the smell of actual food, he said when confronted. That's when I decided Derek needed to learn about con

I'm at this upscale steakhouse celebrating my promotion when this well dressed guy at the next table starts making a scene. He's loudly complaining to the waitress about his 80 dollar ribeye being completely inedible. This is the worst steak I've ever had, he announces, making sure the whole restaurant can hear. It's overcooked, under seasoned, and frankly disgusting. I demand to speak to the manager immediately. The waitress looks confused because the guy had already eaten three quarters of his steak before complaining, but she gets the manager anyway. Sir, I'm terribly sorry. The manager says, what can we do to make this right? The guy, who I'll call Ken, launches into this dramatic performance about food poisoning risks and how his refined palette can detect poor quality meat. I've eaten at the finest restaurants in Europe. Ken declares this wouldn't be acceptable at a roadside diner. I'm not paying for this garbage. Ken demands his entire meal be comped, plus compensation for his ruined evening. He's threatening bad reviews and claims he's a food critic for a major publication. Manager is clearly uncomfortable, but offers to remove the steak from his Bill. Ken rejects this and insists the entire table's meals should be free. Here's the thing. I'm a chef. I own three restaurants in the city, and I know exactly what a perfectly cooked ribeye looks like. Ken's steak was flawless. Medium rare with perfect grill marks and Proper seasoning. More importantly, I recognized Ken's technique. This is a classic dining scam where people eat most of their meal, then complain dramatically to get everything comped.

My daughter somehow convinced her entire school I was sabotaging her grades. Let me explain. Emma's always been brilliant but lazy. When report cards came, she'd have mysterious missing assignments. Despite me asking daily about homework. Her response, I roll. Yes, mom, I'm not 5. Last semester, her English grade dropped to a D. The teacher emailed about 12 missing assignments. Emma shrugged. I turned them in. Teacher lost them. Then came parent teacher night. I walked in expecting a quick chat. Instead, I found Emma's teacher, principal and counselor waiting. The counselor spoke first. Emma tells us you've been disposing of her assignments. Excuse me. She says you throw away her work because you're jealous of her writing talent and afraid she'll outshine you. My jaw dropped. I'm an accountant. Emma's quite convincing. She cried, describing how you told her some people aren't meant for success. My daughter had created a villain origin story for me. At home, I found Emma texting, why tell school I'm destroying your homework without looking up? More interesting than admitting I didn't do it, I confiscated her phone, laptop and bedroom door, then set up a shared drive where she uploaded every assignment with me. C seed. Her English grade now an a. Turns out she's brilliant when she can't blame mom for fictional sabotage.

I live next to this guy, Dave. Dave's the kind of person who times his morning jog and post about it on Facebook like he just qualified for Boston. Everything's a competition with Dave. It starts innocently. We're both leaving for the store at the same time Saturday morning. Dave sees my reusable bags and goes smart, thinking I've got 17 of those. 17, sir. It's not a collection. We end up at the same grocery store. I grab a cart, head inside. Dave's right behind me, but he's got this weird energy like we're about to race. First aisle, produce. I'm picking out bananas when Dave rolls up with his cart. Going for the organic, he asks, eyeing my regular bananas. Just bananas, Dave. He grabs organic bananas, organic apples, organic everything. His cart looks like it's training for a health food Marathon. Gotta fuel the machine. He s flexing slightly while holding a cucumber. Next aisle, cereal. I grab my usual generic brand. Dave immediately goes for the most expensive granola they sell, imported from Switzerland. He announces 23 grams of protein per serving. It's breakfast, not bodybuilding. But then I noticed something. Every aisle I go to, Dave follows every item I pick up. He finds something better. I get pasta sauce, gets artisanal marinara. I get bread. He gets heritage grain sourdough. This isn't shopping. This is some weird grocery superiority contest. I never agreed. To enter the breaking point comes in the frozen food section.

This happened during my senior year. I was in AP Physics with this teacher who had zero tolerance for bullies. There was this kid, Chandler, who thought he was hot stuff because his dad owned car dealerships. Chandler like to brag about his dating life, especially in front of this quiet genius, Rachel, who never spoke up. One day we're doing presentations on momentum and energy. Rachel's explaining collision physics. She's nervous but clearly knows her stuff. Chandler starts yawning loudly and age whispering, someone put me out of my misery. And when does the smart girl stop talking? Rachel stumbles, turns red, her confidence cracking, but she keeps going. The whole class gets uncomfortable waiting to see what happens next. The teacher stands up, walks over and says, Chandler, I have a question about your understanding. Chandler gets this smug look and goes, sure, shoot. The teacher says, if your brain was a car from your dad's lot, would it be certified pre owned or still under warranty for original defects? The entire class went dead silent, then exploded with laughter. Even Chandler's buddies were trying not to laugh because Rachel just explained that clearly has more length and depth than anything you've ever shown a girl. Chandler tried complaining about teacher insults, but the teacher smiled. I wasn't insulting you, Chandler, just using an analogy I thought you'd understand. Rachel, continue your excellent presentation. Rachel crushed it. Chandler stayed. Quiet the rest of the semester and that teacher became legendary. Best classroom roast I've ever witnessed.

I was at Thanksgiving dinner and my uncle, a high powered corporate lawyer, he caught me by the pie table still playing with crayons. He smirked, nodding at my graphic design work. He then announced to my nearby parents, my bonus this year will be more than he'll make in the next decade. He put on that fake concerned face look. I'm just saying, he said loud enough for everyone to hear. Passions cute, but it doesn't pay bills. When's the grown up job coming? I took a bite of my pie, paused for a moment and looked him right in the eye. Thanks for the advice, Uncle Diddy, I said, my voice perfectly calm. You know, I was talking to dad the other day about that big corporate merger you closed last year, the one that got you that huge bonus. Puffed out his chest, beaming. That's right, a lot of hard work. I nodded slowly. Yeah. He told me about the 300 people who were laid off a week before Christmas because of it. The air in the room went still. My aunt froze with her wine glass halfway to her lips. The smug look on my uncle's face began to twitch. He was doing the math in his head, desperately searching for an escape route but found none. He glanced at my dad, a flicker of real panic in his eyes. He had spent a lifetime holding court. But now the jury was staring right at him. The entire family was watching us, waiting. I took one last slow bite of pie, looked him dead in the eye and gave him a small, polite smile. You're right, my passion doesn't pay like yours, but at least no one loses their home because of it.

We're not a store. We're an amusement park. We have set hours, and honestly, no one even goes out to shop for Black Friday anymore. It's all online, so. No, you are wrong. I am staying right here. I am not moving. Okay, that's fine. I'll just Go get security. It makes my life easier.

Just yesterday in Kansas City, huge vote on a possible sales tax, which would then raise money for a brand new Royal Stadium and renovations to the Chief Stadium. But you gotta take a look at some of these proposed renovations and upgrades that would be using public money for the chief stadium. New parking orientation, new parking deck, VIP access road, VIP entry, VIP entry in canopy, new end zone suites. These renovations were expected to cost about 800 million. And the team owner, Clark Hunt, and his family only wanted to pay 300 million. So, Clark Hunt, I ask you, why should the average person be paying so that you can reorient your parking deck, build some VIP suites and a VIP entry? Sort of the resounding feeling online from Royals and Chiefs fans is this whole plan was like half baked with very little communication from these guys. And I don't wanna say that two examples makes a trend, but something sort of similar happened in DC and Northern Virginia.

Because a US city, Salt Lake City, was just announced as the host city for the 2034 Olympics and I haven't heard anyone talk about it. And, you know, people typically think of the Olympics as a big deal, but Salt Lake City, Utah was the only city in the entire world to even put in a bid to host the 2034 Winter Olympics. And that's because cities and governments are starting to realize that hosting the Olympics, hosting these big sporting events, don't actually add anything to that city. Most of the time, the host city ends up losing money. And the only Olympics to make money for the host city was the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, Los Angeles already had a lot of the existing infrastructure needed. Whereas cities like Athens, Greece to build a bunch of very specific, very one use stadiums that you know, wouldn't have a ton of use after the Olympics were over. So that two week stretch where you host these games can actually help to cripple your economy for decades, like what happened in Greece. And to host the Winter Olympics, you have to build like such.

But a lot of people don't know this, right? When you take a whip, it. Right, it only lasts for about one minute. And guess what happens after that one minute? The nitrous gas literally starts eating your brain, bro. Bro, I'm talking about literally eating your brain like it's cereal, bro. You get a little euphoric for, like, all 10 seconds a minute, and then you start feeling constant pain. That's why the dude in this picture, like, yo, this dude is worse than me. Look how much shit he got, man. Yo, bro, you gotta chill out, man. I honestly, can your homie string two words together? he might be mentally ill at this point. I'm not even joking. Like, bro, look how many weapons he has. Like, can he walk? Can he speak? Like, does he know his name? Yo, you gotta call somebody for this shit, man. Like, brother, he got it on the ground. What the. Like, fuck having a sunlight come in, bro. The first thing you see

You have increased. I told this to a girl today. She told me, I'm afraid of people seeing my vulnerability and my weakness because often people would use it against me.

A lot of people don't have strength in those positions. They don't have strength in those emotions. A lot of people have never even questioned their own mortality and they come into a date like, I'm unkillable. Same thing goes for a lot of other people that don't express the truth about themselves as they become less magnetic. Cause you have not a relationship with all of you.

If that patient keeps saying disgusting things to my nurses, I might just forget where we keep the lubricant for his rectal exam. Now, I wanna say that he was kidding when he said this because urologists have very crude humor. But he also didn't laugh when he said this. So who knows? Now, quick context for number two. This was said by an anesthesiologist working in labor and delivery. And I kid you not, the nurses on that floor could not sing his praises more. Like they kept telling me how much they adored working with that man. And for an older male doctor to be praised by these nurses, he must be phenomenal at his job.

No. 1, being charged to hold your stillborn child. Revolution No. 2, being taxed on literally everything and receiving nothing in return while the rest of the developed world pays less in taxes and gets things like universal healthcare, college and other programs meant to help its population. Revolution No. 3, Flint still doesn't have clean water. Revolution No. 4, making a livable wage still isn't enough to afford a home or live. Revolution No. 5, a two mile hospital ride costing over $2,000. Gas is expensive, but it's not that expensive. Revolution No. 6, being the land of the free as long as the government is okay with it, that's not Freedom. Revolution No. 7, banning TikTok for national security reasons, but ignoring every actual problem that is facing the American people. Speaking of which, thank you for continuing to follow my YouTube and Twitch. Revolution No. 8, politicians voting against term limits despite the fact that the majority of Americans, regardless of political view, think that there should be. You know why? Cause they don't work for us. Revolution. As always, thank you so much for watching. Continue to put your reasons for revolution in the comments. As you can see, i have my first mock up of what the potential merchandise will look like. I hope you like this. I plan to have mockups on t shirts within the next few days. I also love y'all's Idea about having different colors for different charities. This one I thought could be for children and this one could be for breast cancer and this one for the black community. That way we could have different merchandise for different charities so you could pick what's important to you. I cannot tell you how grateful I am to all of you for all your kindness and support. And I hope that I can continue to be worthy of that kindness. I appreciate your Faces Revolution.

Here's another list of things I find worthy of revolution No. 1 in 1960, the minimum wage was enough for you to go to the most expensive college in the entire country and come out of college debt free. But now it's not even enough to barely scrape by. Revolution No. 2 using our tax dollars to build highways and then charging us to use said highway so that other people can make profit. Revolution No. 3 US paying $2,000 in rent but then a bank not approving us for a loan on a thousand dollar mortgage because we don't make enough. Revolution No.. 4 military families qualifying for food stamps because they don't make enough. Revolution No. 5 legalizing bribery of government officials in the form of lobbying. Revolution No.. 6 Pew Pews having more rights than women. Revolution No. 7 receiving a hospital Bill after your spouse passes away. Revolution No. 8 receiving a hospital Bill in the name of the child you just gave birth to. Look that one up. Revolution No. 9 being expected to pay the debt of a relative that just passed away. Revolution! Believe it or not, I am literally just getting started on this list. I've made eight videos so far and I'm not even close to done. So continue to put your reasons in the comments that I missed and I'll add it to the next video. Thank you! Have a good day! Revolution!

That's called Hypocritical. Revolution No. 2 working for a company with the name union in it. But then that company union busts its own employees. The irony writes itself. Revolution No. 3 not providing housing to help get the homeless off the street, instead just making homelessness illegal cause that fixes the problem. Revolution No. 4 baby powder companies selling baby powder knowing it had carcinogens in it so that they could make more money. Let me say that again. Baby powder companies sold baby powder meant for babies with carcinogens in it, and the only consequence was a small fine. That shouldn't be a true thing I can say out loud. Revolution No.. 5 insurance being more expensive than your mortgage. But it literally covers nothing. I'm ready for people to stop putting up with that. Revolution!

All right, let's see. Here are two of the states that were either all blue or all red. And as you can see, Oklahoma, my home state, 44th in education, 49th in healthcare, 44th in quality of life, 50th in test scores and top 10 worst poverty rates. If my state could read, they'd be furious about this. Massachusetts, on the other hand, is first in education, second in healthcare, first in quality of life, first in test scores and top 10 least poverty rates. So when you say that conservative policies are the best, I don't know what you're talking about because where's the proof? I believe the way I do because facts don't lie. If the facts showed that conservative states on average did better than every other blue state, I would have no choice but to capitulate. I would have to change my view that conservative policies are better because that's the proof. But that's not the case. Red states over and over and over again are the highest in poverty rates, have the highest infant mortality rates. But y'all say you care about kids, right? Well, the facts say otherwise. They have the highest maternal mortality rates, the lowest outcomes in healthcare. They also claim to have moral superiority, like they're the ones of family values. Well, family values aren't 16 year olds having kids because y'all have the highest teenager pregnancy rate, too. And this isn't To say that if you had a kid young that you're bad in any way, it's just to throw it back in the face of conservatives who say over and over again that they wanna protect kids and they're the ones of moral superiority, yet they're the ones that have the highest teenage pregnancy rate. Yet that's the thing they complain about other states having. So please, I mean, if I, if I'm missing something, show me, show me the evidence of how conservative states are better and where they perform better. Because every time I do research to try to see if a conservative state does better, the evidence isn't there. What are y'all better at? Genuinely, please show me what you're better at. Anyway, thank you guys so much for watching and have the day you deserve.

So I open up with, hi guys, we close in just a few minutes. Did you wanna get something to go? This one's like, we have 15 people here. Do you think we brought them all just to get a to go order? I'm literally just staring at her as they hysterically laugh at me. But I'm just like, well, we close in just a few minutes so we would probably have to be to go. The same woman is like, but we got here before closing, like summons my manager who's like, you guys can totally sit. It's not a problem with us. This woman's like, that's why you're the manager. And he's not, they're like pointing at me laughing. So of course my manager won't take the order. I go up for a drink order, they don't respond to me. So I start walking away. This woman's like, hello? Are you not gonna get a drink order from us? So I go back, I'm like, alright, what did you guys want to drink? She's like, could you list off what you have? Makes me list off the entire drink menu. Coke, Diet Coke, ginger ale, all the way down to chocolate milk. When the kids like, mom, can I get chocolate milk? She's like, how much is it? I'm like, three, 95. She's like, that is highway robbery. No, you cannot. The kid literally starts Crying. So I try to deflect by being like, alright, so what did you guys want to order? She's like, we'll just take 15 waters, all of that for water. So I drop off the water. She's like, why didn't you put six of those in the kitty cups? I'm like, because you didn't ask. Meanwhile, her kids are like 12 years old. She's like, every other restaurant would have just done it for us. So I just go and do it. Twenty minutes later, they're finally ready to place a food order. It's 30 minutes past close. I drop off the food. 20 minutes later, this woman's like, there's a hair in my guacamole. I look, it doesn't look like a hair, but I'm like, alright, I'll take it back to the kitchen. I'm like, guys, she found a hair in her guacamole. She's like, Dean, that is the pulp from the green avocado bag that we use for the guacamole chicken sandwich. I go and I'm like, I'm sorry, ma'am, the chef just said that it's pulp from the avocado. She's like, I have made 1,000 guacamole entrees in my life and I've never seen stringiness like that. I'm like, well, ma'am, the chefs are bald so it's not a hair. This literally gags her. She's like, well then it's from you cause you were mad that we came in when you were about to close. I'm like, no, ma'am, that's not true. She makes me get my Manager, my manager comps their entire meal and she's like, I'm so sorry there was a hair in your food. This will never happen again. This woman's like, we are coming back the same time next week just for you, Janet. No.

I'm like, well, ma'am, I'm sure she does, but she passed away just a few weeks ago, so I'm just trying to get through the day by working. Everyone, of course, is gasping and tipping me 40% until it's the end of the day. We're sweeping and mopping the floor. This woman comes trailing through the door with seven people, and she's ripping around some sheet of paper, being like, hello, where's my table? It's Mother's Day. I had a reservation. We check, and the reservation was for four hours prior. So I'm like, I'm sorry, ma'am, but your reservation was for four hours ago. She gestures to her family. She's like, don't you think if I could have been here sooner, I would have? So we get them sat instantly. The grandma sending back her soup for being too hot. Like, leave it out a little, then, Granny. The kids are throwing food back and forth. The mom and dad are bickering back and forth. Him saying, I wish we didn't come here this late. They're waiting to close on us. At the end, I drop off the check. This woman's like, you know, you should be really grateful to have a mom. Who cares about you? Because look what I'm going through here. I stare this woman dead in her eyes. I'm like, well, ma'am, today is actually my mom's birthday, and she passed away, and I would do anything to spend the day with her. The kids stop throwing their food. They're giving me all their attention. The grandma's hearing aids, like, kicked in or something. The dad is hysterically laughing as the wife stares at me with her mouth open.

What percent of women, how many women in America are between 18 to 24? I find out roughly 10 million women. So just on only fans alone, 10% of women in that age group are on only fans.

Lesbian relationships have the highest rate of domestic violence. Lesbian relationships have the highest rate of divorce. One thing I can't stand is how women try to paint men as these dangerous predators that do nothing but harm women. Do you guys remember when women said they would pick a bear instead of a man in the woods? Who remembers that? It's no wonder that men are just fed up with modern women. Misandry is everywhere in modern society. With the result of recent studies, the creation of social media and women's never ending need to post everything online, we are starting to see how dangerous women are, especially to other women. 70% of one way violence is perpetrated from women to men. 75% of abuse towards children and the elderly is perpetrated by women.

If you only want to work 4 hours, it's gonna be harder for you to get a house. We busted our behinds. We had the bus stop. Hi, whoopee, I'm Freddy. I run numbers on the internet. And I gotta show you something. The minimum wage in 1980 was three dollars and ten cents. It is now seven dollars and twenty five cents. The average salary was 12,500. It's now 59,000. And the median household income was 22,000. And now it's only 77,000 for a 3.5 times increase. However, rent was two hundred and forty three dollars on average. Now it is 19 for a 7.8 times increase. The median house price was 47,000. It is now four hundred and nineteen thousand dollars. For an 8.9 times increase. And the big one, college was 23 dollars. It is now third $30,000. 13 times more expensive. Our median household income, to feel like they did back then for rent should be $171,000 for the family. And for college, it'd be equivalent to our family making 286 thousand dollars. And to remind everyone, the median household income is $77,000. So Whoopi, with all due respect, I think millennials and Gen z's have it at least eight to ten times hard.

But we go to people like my kids in their 20s when they're coming into the system, and we say, the rules have changed. We change retirement age to reflect life expectancy. What's the right age there then, Ambassador? We've got to figure out what it is. But what we do know is 65 is way too low. You are not going to get millennials, especially Gen Zers, to work till they're 70 years old. There's no incentive anymore. At least 30 years ago, the incentive was you could work 40 hours for 40 years, afford a home, afford a living, have retirement, and have hope. You took those incentives away from the younger generations there. You want them to work 40 hours a week for 50 years without being able to buy a home with living paycheck to paycheck working 40 hours. You want them to work 40 hours in corporate America, plus commute and then drive Uber on the weekends just to afford groceries? Corporate America needs to change their incentive.

We saw Pickford make a brilliant penalty save against James Madison last night. And we saw that on his bottle he had the percentages of where each of the main penalty takers for Leicester tend to put. And this morning, and look, it is only Jamie O'hara, but he's come out and said it gives an unfair advan distance to the goalkeeper. I don't know if I like it having the instructions on the bottle. So in this case, Pickford knows that 20% of the time Madison goes left, 20% he goes right, 60% he goes down the middle. Madison should also know that. Pickford knows those stats. And it's a very ballsy decision for Pickford to stay down the middle because if he goes either side of you, you look like a mug. So he makes the save. And I just feel like keepers are at a massive disadvantage on a penalty as it is. They've also just removed the keeper's ability to do any sort of mind games. Instead of making themselves big, waving their arm, I'm saying anything to the attacker, like where does this go? Do we start saying, well, it's a bit of an advantage to the keeper if they're allowed to dive, so let's stop them diving. Well, it's a bit of an advantage to have a goalkeeper in the goal, so let's Get rid of them.

But trust me, you do not wanna open up that can of worms. There's like canon and legends and everyone's fighting about it. No, that's a cop out. It's their primary weapon.

Sorry. Yeah, you're right. We can't. I just, I thought it was cool. Uh, you might want to get the burns checked out in your roof now. Okay. Insurance claim aside, what does the blue mean in Cannon or legends? I don't know what that means. Both, I guess. Well, in legends, the color of the crystal was like naturally occurring. So if you went to a certain planet, there were a lot of blue crystals. If you went to another certain planet, there were a lot of green crystals. But kind of was like a show of rank or just personal preference was like a white belt, a yellow belt. Well, no, it was more like if you're really good at fighting people, you had a blue lightsaber, you were called a Jedi guardian. Even then sometimes that's fought on. If you had a green lightsaber, you were a Jedi counselor. You were more like in tune with the force. So what does it mean in canon? Well, in canon, all kyber crystals Start as colorless, and then when you attune to them and they gain their color. And so you can kind of take it as like a personality test. But even then it doesn't really matter that much. The only ones that really have meaning, meaning are blood crystals and purified crystals.

I want you dating me. So even though will has to go to jail for at least 18 months, you still want to date him? I've waited this long, and I really have not had a connection this strong with anyone. I can look past this. Hello? Hey, I was looking for will. Yeah, this is will. Will, how you doing, man? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Who's this? Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. It's a radio show. Oh, okay. What's going on? Not much. I'm calling you today because we actually had one of our listeners email us about you. Okay. Her name is Miranda. Oh, alright. And Miranda emailed us saying that she'd really like to go out with you again, but you haven't answered any of her phone calls or texts, and she was trying to figure out why. Yeah, that was, um, kind of tough experience, so. Yeah, that's. I just haven't called her back. Bye. She told us about your date, but I kind of want to hear from your perspective. Did you like your time with Miranda? Yeah, I mean, absolutely. But, I mean, did she tell you about the whole date? She told us about the movies, and then she told us about how you guys were, you know, parked in the car, making out. And then she told us about how the police showed up. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you really want me to talk about this on the radio? This is. I mean, it was kind of rough. Yeah, but you're on the phone with us now, so you're not locked up. It can't be that bad. Well, I don't know how comfortable I feel like sharing everything. I mean, I thought Miranda was a really cool girl, and I really. I thought we had a great time. Yeah, and she said she had a great time as well, but she's just. Obviously, if you get arrested on a first date, somebody's gonna have questions. Yeah, and can you. I mean, can you even imagine that she would even wanna go out with you again? Like, if you went out with a girl and she got arrested, you probably wouldn't call her back. Like, she's obviously a forgiving person. I'm kind of surprised that she called you guys or emailed you guys, cause they literally took me away and cops. So, yeah, I'm kind of shocked. But I think we really, like, got along and there was chemistry for sure. if you're answering the phone now and she's tried to reach out to you, why not just call her back if you liked her so much? Because there's more to it. Like, I made a bad mistake a while ago and I'm still paying for it. And regardless of how much I like Miranda and how good of our date went, Like, it's not gonna go well, because I'm gonna have to pay for the mistakes I've made, and it's all coming back on me now. So, just so she knows, I don't know if you're gonna get back to her or anything, but, like, it's not like I did anything horrible. Like, there's no, like, nobody got hurt. Nobody got, you know, hit or anything like that. Hit? Do you mean hit, like, physically, or, like, you're a mobster and you talking about, like, you know, put a hit on somebody? No, meaning, like, punched her, and he's like, there's no violence. It was a stupid thing that I did that, like, nobody got hurt. At, like, victimless. That's the word. But why don't. I mean, why don't you just tell her? Like, she's obviously a forgiving person. Like, if no one got hurt, right, then shouldn't be a big deal. Obviously, I'm not a serial killer. I'm. You know, I'm out right now, but I'm gonna have to go away for a while, so, like, the idea of dating someone or, you know, the. That's just not gonna happen for me, like, next year or so, too, maybe. What? It's not gonna be a thing? Like, it's not even a possibility, okay? And there's no way you can tell us what you did? Come on. Can we guess? You guys, this is not a game. This is serious. Like, I don't. I don't want to share what I did. It. It was stupid. I was. I was an idiot. If you won't share it with us, will you share it with Miranda? Because she's actually on the other line listening and wants to talk to you. Are you serious? Yes, I am. Miranda, are you still there? Hi, will. Oh my god. How are you? I can't believe this. Hi, um, I. I'm Miranda. I'm so sorry, cause I thought you and I had like an amazing time together and I thought we had chemistry, and I was just. It's just horrible luck and stupidity on my part. Well, people mess up. They make mistakes all the time. And it seems like. It's not like you murdered somebody. No, I didn't. I didn't do anything. No one got hurt. Like, I just feel like I've waited so long to meet somebody and we had such a great connection. So if you messed up, I mean, that happens. I just feel like if you just tell us what. What happened, what you did, you know, I can look beyond that. I just took it. I was trying to take advantage of a monetary situation that I thought was gonna go the right way, and it didn't. It went bad. And did you always know that you were making an illegal decision when you were doing it? You know, when it started off, it seemed like, no one's gonna know and no one's gonna get caught. It was like an innocent Thing that, like, no one's gonna miss this and that I was wrong. I was. I was an idiot. But, I mean, Miranda, like, just so you know, I gotta go away for at least 18 months. I'm not gonna be able to date anyone. That's why I didn't call you, because I'm so embarrassed that there's just nothing I can do about this. When you say you can't date anyone else, I mean. No, I don't want you dating anyone else. I want you dating me. Well, what? Are you serious? You can tell from a first date? Wait, so even though will has to go to jail for at least 18 months, you still want to date him? I've waited this long, and I really have not had a connection this strong with anyone. I can look past this. But you don't even really know fully what will did. Well, nobody was heard. There weren't bodies lying anywhere, so I

Hey, I was looking for Danny. Yeah, this is Danny. Danny, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Uh, good. I'm calling you today because you recently went out on a date with one of our listeners, and they gave us your phone number and asked us to call you. Really? Mm hmm. Her name is Amanda. She emailed us and told us about how you picked her up at a target. She thought that was a really cute move, by the way, and told us a little bit about your date, said that she really liked you, but I guess it's been like 2 weeks now and you're not returning her phone calls. Uh huh. Would you mind maybe giving us some insight into why it's been 2 weeks and you haven't called Amanda back? Uh, I guess I just can't see myself being in a relationship with her. And that's kind of what I'm looking for. Is it because of something she did on the date, something she said? I mean, I didn't get to know her really well, but she was kind of gross on our date. What? How was she, how was she gross? Just her manners. I'm not sure really, like how she was raised. And it was kind of shocking to me. Wow. I want, I'm very curious now, Danny. Yeah. Because according to her, your date was perfectly normal. She didn't do anything weird. The thing That she did say was strange about your date was how you shook her hand at the end. Is that why you shook her hand? Because you thought she was gross? Yeah, that's. I needed an exit. Can you give me one specific thing? Yeah. Was she sloppy when she was eating her food? She not put her napkin on her lap? What specifically made you think that she's nasty? Well, it was going fine and like halfway through the meal, she grabbed my hand and she leaned over into my ear and whispered, I'll be back in a few minutes. Okay. I have to honk out a dirt snake. No, she did not say that on the first day. Are you kidding me? You're lying. You're lying about that, Danny. That cannot be real. I swear to God. And she, what was that term again? What was that term again? Oh, man. She said, I have to honk out a dirt snake. Was she being funny or was like, this is legit? That's what I thought. I thought she was making a joke. And I just said, are you serious? She just said, no, really, I have to go download a brown load. I'll be back. No, stop it. She had to have been joking then. Yeah. I mean, come on. Come on, man. Like, I don't know one girl that would do that. No way. Seriously. She had to have been, she had to have been joking with You, Danny, she was not, she left. She was gone for a few minutes. I mean, at the time, I couldn't eat. I lost my appetite. That's how serious she was being. What did she say when she got back to the table? Like she had to have had a smile or been laughing. Yeah, she had a smile and she patted her belly and she said, she said, it looks like someone dropped the kids off at the pool. Cool. She's so good. Was your face red? I didn't know what to say. And she just jumped right back into her meal. And after a few minutes, she noticed and she thought I didn't like it. She asked me if I didn't like the food. And I said I just pretended I was feeling sick.

Hurricane Milton hits and I was just talking shit on the US government cause we're still sending 9 billion dollars to Israel and nothing over like Hurricane refugees. And all I'm saying is if out of all of the 333 million Americans that we have, if my ass is making the news about our money habits, clearly something needs to change. If I am making global news lines talking about how fucked up if I am, out of all the Americans, you're telling me I'm the one? Something's gone. Something's wrong, man. Something. Something needs to change. Something needs to change really fucking fast because I. Me. What the fuck? I don't even like thinking. Genuinely, this is the most shocked I've been.

And like my account I haven't gotten like, not like. You know what I'm saying? Like some accounts, you know, they grow up, they get like fucking 300,000 followers, couple hundred thousand followers or whatever places. Like other people start to mention them.

Now I don't think there's a single thing on planet earth this could be referring to besides Bill Cosby himself so we're we're just gonna skip past that one to No. 3 which is free ditty I don't know what the fuck could be said on this song for him to decide to name it Free Diddy this is gotta be one of the most heinous songs in human history but at No. 4 we have dirty magazines No.5 Bianca too kind of like somewhat normal ones to squeeze in there until immediately at No. 6 we have Virgil let me down this is an insane statement to just say in general but naming a whole ass song after this like I can't imagine the public's reaction to this fucking that's just crazy in itself and then at No. 7 we have hail the German painter so we're making goddamn Nazi propaganda music on this album I guess I don't know what the fuck that's gonna be but then at No. 8 we have Hitler Yi and Jesus those three names should never even be together Hitler, Yi and Jesus sounds like a fucking sign, like live, love, laugh type thing. What the fuck type of song is this? What is even gonna be on that? this whole album just sounds like it shouldn't even be fucking real. And then at No. 9, we have all caps.

I'm running to the nearest exit. You really expect me to go knocking on doors to sit with the other targets? Fuck no. They try to tell you it's wrong for you to run off of school property. Is this a fucking horror game? Are we restricted to a map? No, I'm getting the fuck up out of here. The second that I hear any gunshots firing off, the school expects me to huddle behind my desk like the shit is Captain America's shield. What the fuck is a desk going to do? Cause these motherfuckers, it doesn't matter if it's a goddamn school shooting drill. Tornado, category 5 Hurricane, nuclear fallout, Jesus resurrection. They will tell you to get underneath the desk as if it changes. They're not bolted to the ground that they aren't gonna do fucking anything. I don't give a fuck what is happening in the school. The second shots are pop popping off, I'm finding a window to pry open. I'm getting the fuck up off the school. Y'all motherfuckers really think that sitting in the area where the shooter is gonna change shit they act like fucking running out of the school is a bad option motherfucker, it's A school scooter you want me to be in the area he's at or should I be booking it across like what the fuck are we talking about?

But then the look at 3,000 year old narratives which have guided all of western civilization and say they're just silly fairy tales that stupid old people believed. But not me. No, it's not that I lack all of the conceptual categories to understand. I'm actually very smart simply because of the year I live in. Those people back then were trapped in a cave of prejudice and superstition. Not not me. I will rest reassured and contented with the vague idea that science has figured out and debunked everything and all of the greatest minds of all time who debated things like theology and metaphysics were actually just like, goofing around. My consciousness is actually just electrons and morality isn't real even though I'm a good person. I'm very calculated and reasonable even though my worldview can't explain intelligence.

And that is saying something. But no, we got stuck with the subway slinging State Farm selling Kermit the frog sound alike. Versus the other team, which I'm going to be referring to from here on out as Saquon Barkley in the rest of them because he's the only one on that team that anyone outside of Philadelphia even cares about. I can also tell you exactly how this game is going to go. The Eagles will be the first team to put any points on the board and all of these morons are gonna be like well see, I told you they had a chance. Then someone's going to breathe wrong within 15 yards of Mahomes and the refs will have them arrested for terrorism. The game is going to be pretty even going into the second half, but Then the blind make a wish children that we call refs are gonna make 2 to 3 incredibly stupid calls that allow KC to run away with the game and win by 10 to 14 eagles.

Not an overreaction at all, sir. He's 2 yards shy of the most rush yards in a single postseason prior to reaching the Super Bowl. He is the first NFL player ever with three or more rushing touchdowns of 60 or more yards in their entire playoff career. And he's done it this postseason. The book is not closed on those in the Giants front office. It's not. It keeps being reopened and it keeps being reopened like a festering wound. And this is not an overreaction that he's a Super Bowl win away from the greatest running back season in NFL history. And if he does lose and has a good game again and rips off more, you could still make the case it's the best running back season in NFL history, even though he doesn't win like, say, Riggins did or Terrell Davis did, their terrific seasons. You could make cases. But that would open and shut it. I think so, too.

And you know it wasn't Mark Cuban pulling this trigger because he said if he had to choose between his wife and keeping Luca on the maps, you could catch him at his lawyer's office the next morning. The more that this dude, Nico Harrison talks, the worst it gets for maps fans. He said Jason Kid had no idea this was coming. He said the owner laughed when Nico proposed this trade. He said he had conversations with Rob Polinka over a month ago and even Polinka was like, you're joking, right? He said the way he see is the future is in three to four years. He said, I don't know what'll happen in like 10 years. Maybe me and Jason Kidd will be buried by then. The Lakers were the only team the Mavericks talked to. So you mean to tell me that you've seen teams get these type of trade packages for Maciel Bridges or Rudy Gobert or Paul George and you decide that this is the best trade package you can get for a 25 year old superstar who didn't even ask out?

Over the years, the NBA has made it really hard to add some style to your game. I mean, I've talked about it before, but these ninja headbands were amazing. Players made sure there were the team colors, no logos were showing. Yet still, they were eventually banned for safety reasons. That's the same reason do rags were banned. Sam Perkins tried to start that trend. Tim Thomas wore two headbands at the same time. He did it for about three games before that got banned. And then coincidentally, shortly after, they made tri color headbands for AI. Wayne Wade wore personalized Band Aids during games. He had Wade the American flag and even the flash. Lil Wayne even came to a game with a d. Wade bandaid on before they banned it. Chris Paul tried the upside down headband. Y'all know how the coolest mask ever got banned. J. R. Smith and Kelly Ubre tried to add Supreme to their on court look, but just as everything I mentioned, they got banned. Every time someone tries something new, they take it out of the game immediately. But Trey found a unique way to set himself apart. Back in July, he posted this on Instagram and said, bring swag back. And it seems like he's pretty committed to that. On top of that, he got this new Spider Man tattoo to go along with his new 3 point Celebration.

If you're more into cartoons, he's got a cartoon for you, Shaq's Garage. He was also in an episode of Static Shock. If you're more into reality TV, he's got a show called Shack versus where he challenges other athletes to their sports. If you're more into reading, you could read his life story or you could read a children's book that he wrote. If you're into fashion, obviously you can wear his shoes. He also sells slippers and sandals. If you have to go to a formal event or work, you can get one of his suits, compliment it with some of his jewelry, make sure you smell good with his soap. To make sure you're well rested before the event, get the Shack sleep apnea machine. I don't know if.

First, you're gonna go to the busiest restaurant in your city. You will walk into the door without a reservation and ask to be seated. The person at the host stand will probably tell you, sorry, there's a 30 minute wait. I can take your name down. To which you will reply, um, I actually see a couple of tables right over there. Why can't I be seated? They will tell you that those tables are reserved, and in reply to that, you will visibly look upset. After about 30 minutes of standing around the host stand and making the staff uncomfortable, you will finally be seated. When your server gets to your table, she will try to explain to you all of the specials for the evening. However, you're only going to let her say two words, and then you will say, yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't care. Let me just order. The server will feel uncomfortable and take down your order of just two appetizers. And when those appetizers finally arrive at your table, you will reach into your pocket and grab a DNA sampling kit. Since you were super rude to the staff, they most likely spit in your food, and you will sample your food for any traces of human DNA. Once that DNA is found, you're going to call your lawyer and have him meet you at the restaurant as soon.

And No. 5 is, I'm not even that drunk. This is peak level denial. This is usually said after tripping over nothing, misplacing your own drink with your hand, and slurring your words so badly that your brain forgets what language it's speaking. You are clearly hammered. Everyone knows it. You know it, too. But it's your final stand against an undeniable blackout. No. 4 is the you know what, bro? I love you. If your friend hits you with the I love you, bro, just know he's about three more drinks away from an early bedtime. Once those words start getting uttered, it's not just to you. It's probably to the bartender, it's probably to a stray dog, it's to everyone in the room. Almost is like a final goodbye. Number three is, who wants some shots? This is a drunk declaration of war. If you say this, you're already deep in the trenches, but now you've decided you want everyone else to get deep in the blackout trenches with you. You're like that one guy in every war movie. While everyone is wounded, you're screaming, let's get back out there. It's dangerously inspirational, but I kind of love it. At number two is I could fight god right now.

But what if I told you this wouldn't be the case if the Ballon d'or was actually fair. And I'm not talking about Ronaldo here. You know, the Ballon d'or started all the way back in 1956, but for the first 39 years up until 1995, only European players could win it. This is the reason Pele and Maradona never won a single Ballon d'or. They were simply not eligible. So on 2016, France Football, the host of the Ballon d'or made an official re evaluation to confirm what would have happened if the Ballon d'or had always been open to every player in the world. And the result in 12 of these first 39 Ballon d'or years, there would have actually been a different winner from South America. The Brazilians Pele Garincha and Romario would have won it and the Argentine's Mario Kempes. And of course, Diego Maradona, he would have been a two time Ballon d'or winner in 1986 and in 1990. And now the crazy stuff, Pele would have actually won the Ballon d'or in 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1963, 1964 and 1977 times putting him on the same level as Lionel Messi. So if the Ballon d'or was fair, then Messi and Pele would both have seven awards officially confirmed by France Football.

We fucking know that the World Cup is bigger than the Super Bowl. I have been seeing this graphic on Twitter for the last 8 years of my life. Y'all just got so much insecurity in y'all that y'all gotta compare everything to us. Ain't nobody sitting at home today worried about the World Cup. I can tell you that shit right now. No American sitting in a house right now is talking about, oh my God, the Super Bowl smaller than the World Cup. We know this shit already. I just wanted the Baltimore Ravens to win, bro. Been a Ravens fan my whole life. 2007, you know it. But every year this shit seems to happen. Like, bro, we understand it, bro. Like god damn, damn, man. Like I, not all of us wanna watch soccer, alright? To all my people that live in other countries and do this shit every year, guys, we know. We do not care. I'm just trying to watch the Super Bowl and eat nachos, alright? Like God damn.

You remember when you collapsed the housing market? Now none of us under the age of like 35 are ever gonna own a home. It's almost as funny as how like when you were my age, you could work at Circuit City part time and support a family of six. So funny. It's hilarious. Ripped jeans, people wearing ripped jeans. That's almost as funny as how your generation tanks the value of the dollar globally. So funny. The buying power of the dollar is literally worse right now than it was during the Great Depression. And instead of doing anything to help anyone, you just tell people to work harder, despite the fact that many people are working multiple jobs just to make ends.

What percent of women, how many women in America are between 18 to 24? I find out roughly 10 million women. So just on only fans alone, 10% of women in that age group are on only fans.

We busted our behinds. We had Buster whoopee. Here is the problem millennials are facing today. If you look from 1980 all the way to 2019, the average home prices, this column is what's important. This was the income needed to qualify for the average home every year. Even before the 80s. For the past 50 years, the median household income was more than what you needed to qualify until 2023 where the income needed to qualify is more than the median household income. And another thing you have to look at is this column over here, which is rent. You could rent for just 14% of your income, 17% of your income, 16% of your income. But look when millennials entered the chat, 25%, 25%, 30%, this is when rent prices started to go up. Now millennials could have bought here, but what people forget, in 2010, the youngest millennial was 14 years old. So we're being forced to spend 30% of our money on rent as a family where most people renting.

Otherwise it's unfair, it's discrimination, it's not. Okay, let's calm down and get to the facts. Funny thing is that the people who say that are either not into football or don't have any clue how business and money works. The money has to come from somewhere. Where does it come from? TV rights, merchandising, get sales. All the money a league or a club earns is based on the fan interest. The more fan interest, the more money they pay. The more money the clubs earn, the more money the players earn. We can't make up money. It doesn't grow on trees. This year's Women's Champions League final between Yo and Barcelona, the two best women's teams in the world, brought in 3.6 million total viewers in the whole world. Compared to the men's Champions League final of 2021, Manchester City against Chelsea with over 700 million viewers. And that's not even the two most popular teams in men's football. The 2019 women's World Cup generated a total of $131 million. Respectable. But the men's World Cup 2018 generated almost $6 billion. So what do you wanna do? Take the money the men generated and give it to the women? That would be the opposite of fair. I have the biggest respect for women's football and love to see it growing. But please understand that it's not a gender thing. It's just a popularity thing.

It's important to keep in mind most European borders are invisible and residents enjoy freedom of movement throughout the block. So people rarely know when they're crossing a border. But as countries begin to close their borders to stop the spread of the coronavirus, some Polish border guards accidentally set up a blockade inside the Czech Republic. And it was a pretty easy mistake to make when you look at a map. The border blockade should have been here. But since the border guards had never enforced this crossing before, they accidentally set up their blockade here. When Czech residents tried to visit the church in the middle of the road, they were turned away by the Polish border guards since the Polish border was closed. But the church was in the Czech Republic. It's unclear how long the Polish border blockade was set up for a few days, under a week. But once news reached Prague that Polish border guards had annexed a piece of their country, a message was sent to Warsaw and the blockade was immediately moved to its correct location down the road. The Polish Defense Ministry said the placement of the border post was a result of a misunderstanding, not a deliberate act. It was corrected immediately and the case was resolved.

The event was started by three friends in 2002 who felt they severely lacked creativity in their lives. Their solution was to get a bunch of friends together, build complex suits of armor out of cardboard and get into epic medieval style battles. The first battle was a huge hit and the event series blew up. All the battles have a theme and the Box Wars team builds massive elaborate pieces for each one, like building an aircraft carrier, a monster truck. Participants are encouraged to make the most complex suits of armor possible, but are only allowed to use recycled cardboard and materials that could be found in packaging like tape or hot glue. There are four rules. During a battle, there are no winners, only losers. Use common sense during a battle, only recycled cardboard allowed. And after the battle, kids plunder the battlefield. And if a kid asks you for your armor after the battle, you must give it to them. The Box Wars team sets up kids workshops at each event to teach kids about creating with cardboard and help them build their own pieces.

In may of 2012, Susan Warren, who also owns a cleaning company was bored and wanted something to do. So she picked a house at random while driving down a street, broke into it, wash the morning coffee cups and dishes, took out the trash, vacuumed and clean the playroom. She then wrote a note on a napkin, $75, I was here to clean, along with her name and phone number and left it on the counter. The homeowner's 18 year old daughter was upstairs sleeping while Susan was cleaning. And when the daughter called her mother, Sherry Bush to ask about the cleaning service she had hired, Sherry said she hadn't hired a cleaning service. Sherry later called Susan to tell her she'd cleaned the wrong house to which Susan said, no, I didn't clean the wrong house. I just stopped in and cleaned your house. I do this all the time. Susan had been charged with criminal trespassing a month earlier. And even though Susan hadn't stolen anything, she pled guilty to attempted burglary and trespassing and was sentenced to one year probation. Susan was arrested again in February of 2013 when police found her shoveling snow from a driveway without the owner's consent.

Activision released data on the call of duty game franchise dating from the original call of duty released in 2003 through to Modern warfare's released in 2008 with the data collection ending in 2009. Since the franchise's first release, gamers had collectively played 475,000 years worth of gameplay every year working out to about 25 billion hours played over the data's six year period. At the time in the data release, over 100 million people have played a game of call of duty, a population greater than some countries. Thirty two point three quadrillion rounds have been fired. Thirty one billion care packages have been dropped which is enough to build 15,000 great pyramids of Giza or 100 Great Walls of China. And 5 billion cars have been destroyed, five times more than the amount of cars registered in the world.

Today we're talking about the E4 Mafia. Hypothetically speaking, all branches of the military have this organization. They go by a different name but the concept is the same. For example, the Marine Corps calls theirs the Lance Corporal Underground. Easiest way I can explain this to you is it is always the highest rank that you can achieve without having to become an NCO in the United States Army. That rank is the E4 Specialist, aka the full bird private rank insignia that has become so notorious it is known as the sham shield. If you don't know, NCO stands for non commissioned officer. It is a leadership type role. You are responsible for both yourself and those below you. Point I'm trying to get across is that in theory the E4 specialist is the highest skilled, most experienced soldier you can be in the United States Army while also not having any responsibility at all is because of that, E Four's partake in what is known as shaming. You're a lower enlisted person in the military. Your only responsibility is to do what you're told. Shaming is the sweet, sweet, beautiful art of avoiding being told to do anything that you may do nothing instead. I once knew an E4 that was so good at this everybody called him the shamerai. Another guy that was so good at going unnoticed, his code name was Waldo?

Trump voters are either highly, highly uneducated or fundamentally bad people. Either they don't understand the issues and they're voting on something they don't understand, or they do understand the issues and they understand that by voting for Trump they will harm people, and they do it anyway, making them a bad person. Or the third category, which is that you are willfully ignoring every piece of data that contradicts your viewpoint, making you a fucking idiot. Right. And I had hoped that during the first Trump presidency that when people's lives got worse, they would become educated by the fact that their lives had become worse under Trump. The problem is, he didn't actually get that much done in his first presidency. Right? A lot of it was struck down by the courts. A lot of it was at very targeted groups who weren't voting for him anyway. Right. A lot of it got turned over. Turned the second Biden took office. So what I'm fearful for and what gives me a bit of hope, is I'm fearful that Trump's second term will be much more effective, that he will have the courts on his side.

Like, I'm serious. I think when we first watch Undercover Boss as a society, we should have started burning buildings down. Okay, because if you don't know, Undercover Boss is a show where they take the CEO of usually a relatively major brand, they put them in a disguise, and they have them work a week at one of the minimum wage positions at their company. And they can never do the fucking job. the subway guy could not make a fucking sandwich for the life of him, all right? They. They are incapable of doing minimum wage positions. Every CEO I've ever seen on that show is incapable, even after a week of. Of performing adequately at a minimum wage position. Um, and not only is that enough to incite revolution, in my view, but they always do this bit at the end where they try to make the CEO seem really generous. Cause it is propaganda, right? For CEOs. That's what the show is. But they do this shit at the end where usually throughout the episode,

Like was it really just horrific trial and error? Because if so, that's more like denial and terror. Like you can just pass that information on to later generations through cave paintings and like caveman didn't meet caveman from like 3 miles plus away. So was that just a situation that every family had to figure out? Or how about umbilical cords? How did they disconnect those things? Did they bite it? Was that like a teeth situation or maybe like a sharp rock? Or do they just leave it until it rotted away? Cause like, bro, that's not very hygienic. That's like the opposite of hygienic. Like I know monkeys will just leave the placenta connected, but we're not monkeys. We're cavemen or we were cavemen. Okay, last thing, I swear and I'll just leave you alone. Up until like 1940, every family member slept in the same bed. And also until 1940, every family had like 11 children. Like how do you have time to make the 10 previous children when there's already 10 of them in your bed? Was that just like not a weird thing? Did they not think about it? They like saw farm animals doing things and just assumed moms and dads do that too.

Turns out the dad or the mom aren't actually the parents of the child. They had raised a kid for five years and found out that it wasn't their baby. If neither the man or the wife are the parents, there's only one answer. The hospital switched the babies at birth. So the parents immediately contacted a lawyer and decided to sue the hospital. And they won. They won $2 million. But the story doesn't end there. If the kid that they've been raising for the last five years wasn't their child, where was their biological kid? Well, the biological kid got sent home with two different parents. And after two years of those parents having the kid, they lost custody due to neglect. And so the baby from two to five has been in foster care this whole time. The parents go, great, you know, we can just. We can go get our child. It's in foster care. You know, this is kind of working out good. But here's where the other twist is at. The state of North Carolina told them they have to file for adoption, like if it wasn't their own kid. Which means they had to wait eight months in order to be able to adopt the kid. And had to pay $40,000 to adopt.

What do you mean? How many cases did I order? 35, like you said. That is not what I said. I said three to five. I, I thought you said 35. Why would I need 35 cases? How many pies and cobblers and waffles do you think I'm making? In my mind, I thought 35 cases of blueberries was a lot. But you know what? I am a smart man. I also know when the wife speaks, don't question her. You have a much happier wife. 18,000 dollar worth of blueberries just landed on Tickle's head. He was only supposed to order 3 to 5 cases. Because he misheard, he ended up with 35. Under the blazing sun, the Berry started heating up and rotting and it felt like money was being thrown straight into the trash. When his wife, Carol, saw this, she blew up on the spot, demanding to know how many pies and cobblers he thought he could possibly make. The restaurant was already strapped for cash and this mistake was like pouring gas on the fire. Tickle stood there without saying a word, fully aware that he had really messed up this time. Carol's face only grew colder, even hinting that if he couldn't fix this, there might not be a place for him at home anymore. Pickle knew the restaurant couldn't possibly handle this mountain of blueberries, and if he didn't come up with a plan, they'd all rot. Away. So he came up with a wild idea, to turn all 35 cases into Moonshine, hoping this risky gamble could cover the financial hole and maybe save his marriage. But nobody had ever made blueberry liquor before, and whether the market would accept it was a total mystery. Was Tickle's choice going to be a desperate turnaround or the final straw that completely blew up his already shaky home life?

If their mission now is to get rid of Hamas, then what they are doing is consistent with that, isn't it? No. You said Israel has a right to defend itself. Absolutely zero people think that. This is a ridiculous statement. However, how Israel is defending itself is collective punishment. Collective punishment in the form of depriving 2.2 million people of electricity, of water, of food, 51 people dying in the West Bank where you know there is no Hamas in the West Bank, killing 3,000 thousand, four hundred and eighty Palestinians so far in Gaza, 1000+ children, 22 hospitals being bombed.

You might have been against the Iraq war, but you're using that for evil in my opinion at this point if you are not sitting here and condemning those war crimes, those acts of violence, those acts of collective punishment.

Your mother didn't want me around in your life. And I've wanted to be here for you, but your mother gave me strict mandates. I'm gonna suggest guess that you guys all get together with a family counselor and discuss this. This isn't about a Lamborghini. This is about something deeper than that, something deeper that This court cannot resolve. This case is dismissed.

Thank you so much for joining me for your yearly review and to see if you're gonna be receiving an increase. So I just wanted to go over really quickly some of the feedback that we've gotten from some of your managers. Uh, essentially you've been doing great. Um, you know the scoring system is between a 1 to a five and you basically got 3.5 to 4 across the board, which is great. We don't give anyone a 5 because I feel like there's always room for improvement so we never give anyone a 5. Okay, so why is the score of 5 there? If it's unattainable, why is it even on there as an option? The score of 5 is there so that you can always have something that you wanna achieve like you always wanna reach for the 5. Um, so it, it's the maximum increase that you're gonna receive is gonna be a 5% if you get a 5 anything under a 5 it's just gonna be a little less so for yours it's gonna be yeah, you're gonna receive a 3% increase. Okay, just because it is under that score of 5. So I brought with me a couple of my um projects that I've worked on this year and let me just read you this feedback that I got on this one. Um, Veronica did an excellent job. She was very thorough and delivered her project before the due date. Okay, this One says, Veronica is very proactive. She always anticipates my needs and was able to deliver an exceptional project. And this one says, another slam dunk. Great job. I cannot wait for our next project together. So I guess my question is, throughout the year when I'm doing these projects and receiving feedback stating that I'm doing excellent, um, how does that not translate to an excellent score of 5 when it comes time to give me my increase? Somehow, some way at the end of the year when I'm getting my review, I'm less than excellent. I'm average versus the above average comments that I've gotten throughout the year. It's almost like the comments that I get throughout the year while I'm working do not match with what the comments are when it comes down to me getting my increase. So I'm not accepting 3%. I need my increase to reflect the work that I've done throughout the rest of the year. So, you know, if you can work on that, that'd be wonderful. Um, well, I can't authorize any additional increase. So I guess what I could do is take it back to leadership and see what their thoughts on everything r because I, I just can't approve it right now. I can't approve more than 3%. Well, I appreciate that. I'll be waiting for your response.

So I know it's a lot for right when you come back and there's a lot of moving parts, but let's circle back and make sure you come talk to me, okay?

Um, we just need to let you guys know that we are short staffed right now. Um, it's not in the budget to hire anyone else. So we're gonna have to ask you to step up a little bit more. We need some people to stay a little later in the evenings and we're just gonna need everyone to pick up some extra shifts. Okay, I have a question. Yeah, Veronica, go ahead. The requisition has been listed on our website for 3 months. Why haven't we hired anyone? So as I mentioned team, we just don't have it in the budget right now to hire anyone. So I, I'm, I wish we could. Go ahead. Didn't I just see on the news that our CEO gave himself an end of year bonus of like $4 million? What our CEO does, I can't tell you. I can't tell him not to take a bonus. Yeah. So since this is a team effort, are the managers gonna be stepping up as well? Are you guys gonna be taking some extra shifts and staying late or no? Managers are not gonna be participating in this. This is more of a frontline ask. Go ahead. Well, in that case, one of the managers are gonna be picking up my daughter after school and taking her to ballet since I'm not gonna be getting out on time? And who's gonna be making Dinner for my family and doing my laundry any ideas? You know that I can't do that you know that I can't go pick up your kid you know I can't go cook for your husband you know that I I can't clean your house I mean yeah, so it's okay for the managers and the company to ask us to step up and do all these things but then we're supposed to take care of all our responsibilities like who's gonna take care of all our responsibilities? Okay, all right. Okay, you know what what we'll just pick up this meeting we'll pick it up tomorrow I I just have to go make some phone calls we'll just pick this up another day.

Come on in, have a seat. Okay, thank you. So as you can see, your manager's here and they're basically just here so she can provide an account of what she believes happened. Um, it looks like you filed some paperwork incorrectly. There was a list and you went from the bottom up instead of from the top down and that is the incorrect way to do it. So we are gonna have to write you up. Is there anything that you wanna say about that? Oh, yeah. Uh, she told me to do it from the bottom up. What? No, I did not say that, Veronica. Don't say that. I said that because I did not say that. Are you sure you wanna stick to that story? It's not a story. I'm sticking to it because it's the truth. I did not tell you to start from the bottom up. Why would I do that? Okay, so there's just, there's no way to prove that she told you. As a matter of fact, Maria, there is a way to prove it. I have a recording of her telling me to do it because I had a feeling that she was gonna pull something like this. No, that's illegal. You can't, you can't play a recording. I didn't consent to that. We're not on law and order and I'm not presenting this to a judge as exhibit A. I'm presenting this to Maria to show her that you're A liar because you have a tendency to tell people one thing and then say that you didn't say that and cover your ass. So sorry. I recorded you because I knew you were gonna do something like this Veronica. So I know that Maria prefers for you to work that list from the top down, but I think I think we're just gonna do it from the bottom up. Um, there's just I don't see the reason I don't see the point of doing it from the top down. Um, and there's a couple more people you know that we wanna look out for starting at the bottom cause of their last name. So just go ahead and do it from the bottom. Okay, Veronica, you're excused. Um, I need to speak with Janet. Thank you Maria. I'm going home. You can't leave for the day. You have work to finish with the shit you just pulled. You better be lucky that all I'm doing is going home for the day and not reporting you to HR for a hostile work environment.

How can I help you? Hi, Veronica. I was just on the phone with one of your agents and I'm so sorry. I, I didn't mean to get emotional, but I had the worst experience. She was so condescending and so rude. And no, I just, I'm so sorry. It's not your fault. I think her name was Cynthia. I just, you were speaking with Cynthia? Yes. And I just, she was, she threatened to hang up on me. She threatened to disconnect the call and I, you know, I'm a loyal member. Okay. Yeah, that's definitely not the experience I wanted you to have. Can you hold on just one moment while I pull up the call? What, what do, what do you mean what? Pull up the call for? You're gonna, you're gonna listen to the call now? Yes, I, I'd like to pull up the call and listen to it quickly. Um, if you don't mind, just so that I can see where the service failure was. That's not necessary. I don't think we need to do that. I just wanted to speak to a manager and let them know what was going on. That's all it was. Well, if she didn't treat you with respect, then I wanna make sure that I make up for it immediately. I don't wanna have to call you back and, uh, possibly miss you if I call back. So let's just go ahead. And listen to, you know, I just, you know, it's no, it's okay. No, let's go ahead and listen to the call together. Yeah, I just wanna see and make sure that she did what she was supposed to do. You must be a special kind of stupid. I am an American Express Platinum card holder. I don't care what you have to do to get this fee waved, but I need you to waive this, ma'am. No, no, no, no. Don't interrupt me. Do not interrupt me. You work for me. You're a service worker. Okay, you work for me. Ma'am, you will have to let me speak. Otherwise, I'll have to disconnect the call that we're not getting to. I dare you to disconnect the call. I don't care how I'm speaking to you. The customer is always right. Or have you never heard of that working in customer service and you don't know that I as the customer have the right, all the, and you have no right. Your company's not gonna back you up. Are you kidding me? As a matter of fact, get me over to your manager immediately. Immediately. Let me place you on hold one moment. No, I don't wanna be placed on hold. I wanna speak to someone. Now just to confirm that was your voice on the recording. I don't need you to use my recording against me. I thought you recorded calls for training quality purposes. You're absolutely right. Our Calls are recorded for training and quality purposes. More times than not, the training is for the customer because they need to be taught how to have respect for people who are trying to help them. Clearly something you missed out on. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and suspend your account. Had she been in the wrong, she would have been coached and we probably would have been able to give you a credit on your account. But you were actually the aggressor in this situation, so we no longer wish to do business with you. I'll just go to someone higher than you. I'll go, I'll speak to someone higher than you. There's no one higher you're gonna be able to speak to that's gonna give you a different answer. We back our employees here.

We don't have a lot of Spanish or French speaking customers, but if we do, I'm hoping that we can count on you for those translation services. Yeah, I'm happy to offer translation services. Does that come with an additional payment? Is it separately invoiced whenever you have to use my services or how does that work? No, your pay doesn't include bilingual services. Your, um, the salary that we're currently offering, it's, it's just, it's just in general. But, um, we do ask, uh, that you participate actively in the improvement of our company and sometimes we have to communicate with, you know, people who don't speak our language and you would be a great asset if you could just do that for us sort of like a favor out of sheer curiosity. If I were to not be available to translate or I wasn't fluent in multiple languages, um, how would you communicate or how have you been communicating with your non English speaking clients? Um, we would contact the translator line that we've been using. So, so your company is willing to pay a translator line to translate, but you're gonna have someone in house that can provide these services on demand whenever needed and you're not willing to pay extra for that. And the reason I'm asking is because, um, I paid a lot of money to learn French and to Become fluent in Spanish and it wasn't a favor that someone did for me. I had to put in the time and I had to put in the effort to learn these languages. Um, even English like I I'm fluent in English and that's something that not a lot of people can say these days. So, um, it's just funny to me that you use the word favor, but you're willing to pay a translator line. So, um, as far as my bilingual efforts, uh, again, you can either add pay to my salary to use those or I can invoice you separately whenever they're needed or we can just remove them as an optional together and I can just completely speak English all the time.

My name is Veronica. Who am I speaking with? Yeah, my name is Carmen. Did you say pre customer service? Yes, I did. What is that? What does that even mean? What? I need to speak to the customer service. the department that filters calls before they reach our customer service agents. That just sounds like a waste of my time. What are you even there for? We're here to make sure that our customers are in the right state of mind, that they're mentally stable and that they're not calling in with too much aggression. Listen, I just need to speak to someone in customer service. So how do I get there? So you have different levels. Right now I would put you at a level 2 because you seem a little agitated. Essentially, if you get to a level 3, the call disconnects automatically so that it doesn't count against our agents. Look, I don't know if this is some kind of game, but I need to be transferred now. Now. Yes. So in order to be transferred to the customer service agent that you need to speak with, you gotta bring it down a notch. Otherwise we hang up and you can call back another day. I've literally never heard of something like this before. Yes, I understand you've never heard of this before. It's because it's a new concept. There were too many customers calling in yelling Being disrespectful cursing out our agents and we're just not standing for that anymore so we're basically like the funnel that gets rid of the customers that are acting up and then we let through the customers that call in with respect those are the customers that you know we help and they get what they need and they go on their merry way but the customers who call in you know treating our customer service agents as if they're beneath them those are not the kind of customers we want so basically we just we don't even get you over to that department if you're if you're being a little too extra if that makes sense am I being transferred or not? It's up to you if you're gonna get transferred or not you've been a little you've been a little much right? You caught that I guess. Yeah. No, you let me know because if I transfer you and you get loud over there the system automatically registers that and it drops the call mm hmm yeah, we're not playing these games with you guys anymore. Nope. Listen, I don't wanna get hung up on so I'll just call back I'll just call back okay. Yeah, you call us back when you feel like you're ready to talk like an adult okay?

That's impossible. Why would I have to choose? Just answer me. I don't know. I love you both. Your sister needs that surgery. The doctors say it costs $300,000. We were saving that money for our wedding. Jessica, what are you saying? Use the money for her surgery. Only 1% of people can comment money with their eyes closed. That's too easy. What? It's impossible. But our wedding, our future. Your sister's life is more important. Are you sure? I'm sure. Save her. Adam. I love you so much. I love you, too. More than you know. Surgery is scheduled for next month. That's wonderful. But what about us? Our plans? We'll figure it out. It'll take years to save that money again. Then we'll wait years. You'd really wait that long for me? I'd wait forever if I had to. You're incredible. I don't deserve you. Yes, you do. We all deserve love. The surgery was successful. Emma is going to be okay. That's amazing. I'm so happy. She wants to meet you to thank the girl who saved her life. I didn't save her. You did. No, you did. Jessica, you gave up your dream wedding for a stranger. She's not a stranger. She's your sister. That makes her my family. 2 Adam, we need to talk. What's wrong? You sound serious. I got a job offer in Japan. That's great. You've always wanted To work internationally. It's a five year contract. Contina app. Help me. I need to speak to roast Bot. Roast bot? Roast her. Five years, Jessica. That's so long. Five years, Jessica. That's so long. Excuse me. Where do I get roast bot? Just click here. The salary is incredible. We could save enough for 10 weddings. But I'd have to wait five more years to marry you. I know it's asking a lot. You sacrificed for my family. Now I'll sacrifice for our future. Take the job, baby. Are you sure? I'm sure. I'll wait for you. You. I miss you every day. I miss you, too. How's work? Amazing. But lonely. I wish you were here to see Mount Fuji with me. Send me photos of everything. I wanna see your world. How's Emma doing? She's perfect. She asks about you every day. She calls you her guardian angel. It's two years. Three more to go. The hardest part is already behind us. Sometimes I wonder if this was a mistake. Don't say that. You're building our future. But what if you find someone else? Impossible. My heart belongs to you. Promise me something. Anything. If you ever wanna move on, just tell me. That will never happen. You're my forever. Jessica. Adam, something happened. What's wrong? I got diagnosed with a rare illness. The doctors here say I need treatment immediately. I'm flying to Japan right now. No, you can't afford it. And Emma still needs checkups. I don't care about money. The treatment cost $500,000. Even my salary can't cover it. We'll find a way. There is no way. Adam, I think this is goodbye. Don't you dare give up on me. I have an idea, but you won't like it. What idea? I'm selling our house. Everything we own. Emma's starting a fundraiser at school. The whole town is helping. Adam, no, that's too much. You saved my sister's life. Now it's my turn to save yours. We're family. That's what family does. I'm cancer free! I'm crying tears of joy. The whole town really came together. Everyone loves you, Jessica. Emma raised $50,000 just from her school. I can't believe it. Believe it. You're worth saving. I'm coming home early. My contract ends next month. Really? I realized something during my treatment. Money doesn't matter. Only love does. I'll be waiting at the airport with a ring. With the most beautiful ring I could afford. It's not expensive, but it's filled with all my love. That makes it priceless. Welcome home, my heart. Let's get married. Bro, I spent over 7 K hours on TikTok. What? How do I check? Bro, just click share more calculator. I spent 50 K

Hi, can I speak to Jessica, please? This is she. Hey, Jessica, how are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Jubal? Uh huh. From Brooke and Jubal in the morning. It's a radio show. Yeah, I. I know it. I just. Oh, cool. Don't know why you're calling me. I'm calling you because somebody emailed us about you. Was it my friend Karen? I don't think so. No, I haven't seen her from Karen. I'll check though, later to see if she emailed, but no, this is from Sean. Oh, my god, you remember Sean? You went out with Sean? Yes. Well, if you know the show, you probably heard A second date update before. Yeah, I know my friend Karen does. She's, like, obsessed with you guys. Okay, so that's why I asked if. If it was her that emailed. Oh, gotcha. Well, second date update is where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up not calling them back after, they can email us to get you on the phone and find out what happened. So Sean emailed us and told us about the night you guys hung out and is very confused why you ditched him in your own apartment and also why you won't call him back. Wow, he told you that? Yeah. It was not great. I honestly wish that this had never even happened. And I can't believe I'm reliving this on our Radio show right now. It has to be worse than not great. I mean, to leave a stranger in your apartment. Yeah. Wait, so can you tell us what happened on your date? Okay, so me and John went out and I had a very weird feeling from the moment that we got together. Like something was just off. Is that why things were awkward at First? Cause he told us about your date. He said things were obviously awkward between you two at the beginning of it. Yeah, I just had a weird feeling and I. I guess that, like, carried into how the date went. Um, so, wait, like, weird feeling? Like you felt like he was a serial killer? Cause that's how whenever I say weird feeling, I feel like someone is bad. Not that I thought he was gonna kill me, cause I would have, like, left, okay, at the restaurant if that was the case. But when he said, hey, this isn't going well, I was relieved, you know? Like, I was relieved when he suggested that we leave. And I asked him to walk me home. And things got, you know, a little bit better. We were talking and. And enjoying ourselves a little bit and, um, enjoying the conversation. And so, um. Wait, what did he tell you? He just said that you guys ended up going up to your place, and then things were better, and then after you guys were done, Hanging out. Then you left and didn't hear from you? Yeah, well, um, there was a moment where we were sitting down, and he dropped his phone, and when he reached for it, he said, oh, corn nuts. Okay, this is after you guys have hooked up or before he told you that? God, this is after. Okay, considering you know the details, um, this is after. So he drops the phone, he says, oh, corn nuts. And I realized that's something that one of my uncles used to say all the time. Okay, so it reminds you of your uncle or something? Oh, no. Well, that uncle has a son named Sean. Wait, what? Whoa. So are you thinking that. What? What? Sean is your cousin? Yeah. Oh, my god. Shut up. Um, I'm still not 100% sure, but I hadn't seen him in a while. If it was him, so I just panicked. I panicked and I left. But you know what your cousin looks like, right? I mean, I haven't seen him since we were children. Oh, people evolved and all. Shawns kind of look the same. That too. So you think that he's your cousin and you went out with him? That sounds so much worse when you say it. Have you done any research into this? Like, I would be on the phone immediately with my parents, like, hey, where's cousin Sean at? What's the likelihood? Please tell me he disappeared. Yeah, it's living in Another country. Give me some hope. I honestly have just wanted to pretend that this never happened. And that's kind of been my approach. I can understand that. Because you think you slept with your cousin. Stop. Please stop saying that. Oh my god. It's mortifying. Oh, my god. Yeah, that'd be embarrassing. Why don't we. I'm gonna be sick. A good idea is to check with him and see if he actually is your cousin. Cause he's on the other line listening to this and wants to talk to you. What? Yeah, maybe he's still there. I don't know. Sean, are you still there? Jessica? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh my god. Did you hear all that? Yeah. Did you just hear all that? I did. Are you Hank and Lily's daughter?

Just hear me out. Dad bought you a car, but he's returning it as a way to punish you. Right? Right. But if you Say you don't want the car. Then returning the car won't be a punishment. I guess. But why would he believe me? Because you still have one advantage. Dad doesn't know that you know his plan. Dad doesn't know I know he found the alcohol. Exactly. And since we're using Snapchat, there will never be any proof that you told me. Tell dad to give me the car, and I will let you drive it whenever you want. You got it. Sis, you coming home? Come take her for a spin. Hey, dad. I really wanna come home, but I can't be around my sister. We just got in a big fight. What happened? I probably shouldn't tell you this, but I caught her and her friend drinking alcohol. I told her to stop, but she wouldn't listen. So I took the alcohol and hid it in my room. She yelled at me.

It's Annabelle from your math class. The one who always has their headphones on? Yeah. How did you get my number? I just asked your friend Jason. And he gave it to you, huh. The audacity of this dude, just handing out my number to anyone without letting me know. Do you not want my number? No offense, but not really. Well, um, I was wondering if you wanted to get to know each other a little. I have a girlfriend already. Sorry. I mean, we don't have to be dating. It wouldn't hurt to just be friends, right? Uh, no disrespect, but I'm not really interested. I think you're a little lost right now. Yeah, you're probably right. Ha, ha. But don't think I'm going to give up that easily. Whatever floats your boat. Hey, it's me again. Hey. Can I ask you something? Of course. Were you the one that put that love letter in my locker with the heart chocolates? Maybe. Did you like the chocolates? No, I just threw them away. Oh. Uh, they were homemade. Also, just for the future, can you avoid putting stuff in my lockers? My friends were making fun of me because of it. Yeah, sure. Sorry about that. Hey, Annabelle, you need to learn how to take a hint. You've been texting me more than my girl, and I've been turning you down straight up each time. Does it bother you? A little, but I don't Really? Mind? I guess. So you like it when I text you? Haha, no chance. Oh, also, I was wondering what you were doing tomorrow. Nothing as of right now. Why? Well, I don't know if you knew or not, but there's a blue moon tomorrow and I know this really nice spot near the lake and I was wondering if you maybe wanted to come. Lol, why would I wanna go with you? We aren't even friends. But thanks for the great date idea. I'mma ask my girl if she wants to see it with me. Oh, ha ha, no problem. I'll just watch it on my own. I like being alone anyways. Yeah, I can tell. Hey, did you see that Mr. Matthews put us together for the presentation? Unfortunately, yeah. Isn't that great? No. My friends are making fun of me again because of you. I understand. Sorry again about that. But you don't understand. You don't have any friends, do you? Not really. Yeah, I expected as much considering how lame and antisocial you are. Lol. Anyways, what are we supposed to do about the presentation? Um, if you're free tomorrow, you could come over to my place and we could work on it together. If that's okay with you. Sure, I guess. What time? It's seven PM. Okay, yeah, that works. Awesome. See you tomorrow. Alright, I'm outside. I'll be there in a minute. I'm playing with the cat right now. The cat? Yeah, she's Not mine. She's a stray cat that always comes over and I feed and play with. Here, play with it. So you're like, touching it? Yeah. Why? What if the cat's like carrying a disease or something and it's all filthy and stuff? I don't really mind. She's super cute and she needs some love. Yeah, yeah, whatever. Can you hurry up though? I'm freezing out here. Oh, sorry. Coming right now. Hey, the presentation went pretty good, right? Yeah, I think we got a good grade. We worked better together than I had expected. I know, right? Do you think it's okay to call you a friend now? Ha ha, no. Say what you want. I believe that we will become friends eventually. And I believe that you are being extremely delusional. Hello? You didn't come to school today. Yeah, I woke up pretty sick today. It's because of that cat. I told you so. Maybe I'll send you over the notes from today. Is there anything else that you need? Well, I do kind of want some chocolates. Alright, I'll be over in an hour or two. Thank you. I appreciate it a lot. Yeah, no problem. Also, uh, maybe try not to get sick again. What's that? Are you worried about me? You wish. Haha. I'm just bored and I have nothing to do right now. Thanks for yesterday, by the way. The chocolates really cheered me up. Yeah, no problem. Also, did you see our grade? For the presentation. We got a 98. Yeah, I saw. Couldn't have done it without you. That means a lot. Thanks. Anyways, what are you doing today? I'm playing with the stray cat again. I named her, too. Didn't she just get you sick because of her? What did you name her, though? Sakura. Like the Japanese cherry blossoms. It seemed to fit. That's a nice name. I know, right? Hey, your outfit was cute today. Really? Yeah. Thank you so much. That's the first compliment I've had in a long time. Relax, I just said it was cute. No need to overreact or anything. Anyways, I was wondering. Apparently the stars are gonna be really nice out tonight, and I wanted to ask if you wanted to go see them with me. Are you asking me on a date right now? No, it's not like that. Just to, like, you know, hang out and stuff. You know what? Whatever, I guess. So. Wanna meet at the lake? We can go to that spot that you mentioned the other day. Sounds good. See you then. Yeah, see you. Hello? Hey, what's up? Well, I heard about you and your girlfriend. I'm sorry. No, don't worry. It was bound to happen. Really? Why? I don't know. We just weren't, like, clicking anymore, you know? That's sad to hear. Anyways, I bought two tickets to the Olivia Rodrigo concert, and the second ticket doesn't really have an owner anymore. And I don't Know if you listen to her or not? But if you do, I was wondering if you wanted to go with me. Are you kidding me? I love her. I'm so down to go. Awesome! But do you want me going with you? Yeah, why not? I don't know. What if your friends find out and make fun of you again? Who cares about my friends? They're a bunch of losers anyways. So I guess this means we're officially friends. Sure, I guess. You're my first friend. Hey, what do you want? Why did you ignore me at school today? Why? Cause you're a freak loner. What happened to us? I thought we were friends. Friends with you? Lol. Yeah, that's never happening. Why are you like this? You toy with my emotions and get close to me. Then you are cold all of a sudden again. I should have known it was too good to be real to begin with. I was never close to you. The only thing we did together was a project. Don't think I had any feelings for you. So that entire time you didn't consider me as a friend even once? No. I thought so. I don't know why I'm even surprised. I should be used to stuff like this by now. Hey, why weren't you at school today? I'm sorry for what I said yesterday. I didn't mean it. Can you forgive me? Hey, you weren't at school today again. I'm sorry again. Is there any way I can make it up to you? It's been a year since you made your way up to heaven. I just wanted to let you know that I never threw away the chocolates. I ate them. They were really good, by the way.

Dad bought it for you, but he's going to return it, teach you a lesson. What lesson does that teach? I don't know. I told him to keep the car, but he's just so mad. How did he find the alcohol? He found it under your bed. Why was he looking under my bed? I don't know. Why are you helping me? Because we're family. Is mom making tacos? No, she's in your room looking for more stuff. Crap. Mom's involved, too. What do I do? Don't come home. I have to come home at some point. The moment you come home, you're getting grounded for a long, long time. AD keeps texting me. What should I say? I do have one idea. What is it? It won't get you out of trouble, but it might save the car. What's the idea? Say you don't want the car. Say you want me to have it. Just hear me out. Dad bought you a car, but he's returning it as a way to punish you. Right? Right. But if you Say you don't want the car. Then returning the car won't be a punishment. I guess.

Just a hobby of mine. What the hell is the hobby? Is it to piss people off? No. Ha ha. How did you even get my number? I asked the landlord. He said he's asked you many times, but you keep doing it.

But that just means she wasn't the right one for you anyways. Can we talk about something else? Yeah, sure. How much longer will you be making this noise for? I might invest in some earplugs. It's not that bad. Stop it! But tomorrow should be the last day. Well, let me just say I'm excited to finally get some peace. Well, I'm glad. Anyways, I'm gonna get back to work. Talk tomorrow maybe? Uh. Oh my god, it's getting louder by the minute. Sorry, I'll tone it down a bit. Oh my god! What is it that you are doing that is so important, but yet you can't tell me? Why do you need to know so bad? I don't need to know. I just wanna know. Because you are the only person making this type of noise in the complex. I'm surprised everyone isn't complaining about you. And I told you I'm almost done. After that, you won't need to hear from me again. Oh my. Alright, just finish up. It's 8:00. You have an hour. Okay. And gosh, turn off that music. Sounds like a screeching cat. What? No way you can listen to that! I have to. You don't understand. You're so annoying. Okay, Today is the day you told me you would be finished. I will in a couple of hours. Are you at least going to show me what the hell it is that you've been doing all this time? I could, but you have to promise not to make fun of it. Sure. I mean, I think I've already made fun of you enough. True. Alright, let me get back to work. I'll text you when I'm done. Sure. Alright, I'm done. Oh my god. Finally!

Major news. The FBI raided the home of former National Security Advisor John Bolton this morning in Maryland. The raid is part of a broader investigation into the handling of classified materials and the possibility that sensitive documents were leaked to the media. Bolton's time in the Trump administration was filled with drama. He's been a sharp critic of Trump since leaving office, even writing a memoir that sparked a heated legal battle over whether it contained classified information. Now the FBI is revisiting those issues, looking into whether Bolton mishandled top secret materials or shared them with journalists. Why is this important for you? This case could change the way former officials are held accountable for handling sensitive information. If the FBI uncovers wrongdoing, it could mean that top government officials will face more scrutiny once they leave office. With the political backdrop of Bolton's strained relationship with Trump, this investigation is bound to create waves. What do you think? Is this an important step in holding former officials accountable or is it politically motivated? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.

My sister's book club was meeting at my place and I specifically told everyone my cat, Salem was shy around strangers. He's a rescue who had a rough start in life and loud voices or sudden movement send him into hiding for hours. I put him in my bedroom with his favorite blanket, get some treats and his water bowl, making sure he'd be comfortable while the ladies discussed their latest romance novel. The meeting was going well from what I could hear, lots of laughter and animated discussion about the book's complicated love triangle. I was in the kitchen preparing their snack refills when I decided to check on Salem after about an hour. Sometimes he gets curious about voices and wants to peek out from under the bed. I walked down the hallway and immediately froze. The bedroom door was wide open and I distinctly remembered closing it firmly. My stomach dropped as I called Salem's name. But there, there's no response. No rustling from under the bed where he usually hides, no gentle purring from his favorite corner by the window. I rushed back to the living room trying to keep my voice calm. Has anyone seen my cat? He was in the bedroom, but now he's missing. Most of the women looked genuine we concerned and started offering to help search. But this one woman, Karen, who my sister had mentioned was new To the group just shrugged at this completely dismissive look on her face. Oh, I let him outside about 20 minutes ago, she said casually, like she was discussing the weather. I saw him in that stuffy little room and felt bad for him. Cats belong outdoors anyway. They're not meant to be prisoners and houses. My heart completely dropped. Salem is really indoor declauded by his previous owners and absolutely terrified of everything, car sounds, other animals, even rustling leaves. Never been outside in the three years I'd had him and we live on a street with constant traffic. It was already getting dark outside. You did what? I couldn't hide the panic in my voice. He's declawed. He can't defend himself and he's never been outside. Karen rolled her eyes dramatically. You're being way too dramatic. He's a cat. He'll figure it out. This is probably the best thing that's ever happened to him, finally getting to experience real life instead of being like some kind of stuffed animal. I didn't waste time arguing with her. I grabbed a flashlight from the kitchen drawer and ran outside calling Salem's name frantically. The other book club members were right behind me also calling for him and looking genuinely worried. But Karen stayed mounted on my couch, sipping her wine and shaking her head like we were all completely overreacting. He'll come back when he's hungry, she called after us smugly. You'll see tomorrow morning he'll be sitting at the Door and you'll thank me for giving him some real independence. Twenty minutes of searching felt like absolute hours. I was checking under every car, behind every bush, calling his name until my voice was getting hoarse. The other women had spread out across the neighborhood, knocking on doors and asking if anyone had seen a small great tabby cat. Finally, I heard it, the faintest meowing coming from our neighbor's backyard. It was barely audible, almost like a whisper, and it sounded absolutely terrified. I followed the sound to their wooden deck and realized it was coming from underneath there, huddled in the far corner under the deck with Salem, he was shaking violently, covered in dirt and spider webs, his normally pristine fur completely matted. His eyes were wide with sheer terror. And he was making these tiny, desperate meowing sounds that absolutely broke my heart. When I crawled under the deck to reach him, I found something that made my blood boil with rage. Someone had tied a old piece of paper to his collar with kitchen twine, a note that definitely wasn't there.

Now they wanna meet in person. I'm 22 and have basically zero experience talking to girls. Gaming is where I feel comfortable. Just bros on discord, grinding ranked, talking about KD ratios, and complaining about teammates. Last month I misclicked a discord invite my friend sent me. Instead of elite gamers, I joined Gamer Girls only. No toxic bros allowed. Uh. My first instinct was to leave immediately, but before I could exit, they started discussing advanced valorant Strats I'd never heard of. I muted my mic and listened, completely stunned. When Megan asked why I was quiet, I panicked and said my mic was broken. Then Maya asked about my rank and I accidentally squeaked out Diamond in the highest voice possible. Dead silence for what felt like forever. Then Jessica burst out laughing. Girl, you sound like you've been chain smoking since you were 12. What happened to your voice? They assumed I was a girl with an unusually deep voice. In my panic, I just went with it instead of correcting them. That was three weeks ago. Now I'm Alex, they think it's short for Alexandra, and we play together every single night from around 8 p. M. To midnight. Here's where it gets weird. I'm actually good at being a girl online. I listen more instead of immediately offering solutions. I'm way less toxic when we lose rounds and I ask questions instead of pretending I already know everything. Maya taught me movement techniques and crosshair positioning that boosted my KD from a pathetic 0.8 to 2.1. Megan got me into cozy indie games like Stardew Valley that I'd never admit to my guy friends that I actually love. Jessica and I stay up until 3:00am talking about everything. Relationship problems, career stress, only drama, fears about the future. These conversations were deeper than anything I'd ever had with my guy friends. No posturing, no competition, just genuine support. Maya was struggling with her programming boot camp, and I actually helped her debug code for hours. Megan was dealing with workplace harassment, and we all brainstorm solutions together. When Jessica's mom was in the hospital, we organized a gaming Marathon to keep her distracted. But yesterday, Jessica dropped a bomb. There's a gaming convention next weekend. We should totally meet up. All three of them were instantly excited about meeting up. They started planning matching outfits, booking hotel rooms at the same place, making dinner reservations at this Korean BBQ place they've been wanting to try. I spent that entire night researching voice training tutorials on YouTube and wondering if I could somehow pull off showing up in a wig and makeup. I watched videos about feminine body language, practiced walking differently in my room, and even looked up makeup tutorials for beginners. The complete absurdity of the situation hit me around 2 a m. I was seriously planning To dress in full drag just to maintain a lie with my three best friends. So I made a decision the next night, during our usual Minecraft session. I

It was a different friend. And I can't help but overhear their conversation. And oh boy, you know what this stupid motherfucker says? If you go underwater, like why do you hold your breath? can't you just breathe like fish and you can stay there for a while? I want you guys to let that sink in now I'm genuinely concerned for him cause this motherfucker is actually stupid. What makes it worse is his friend is actually agreeing with him. And they're both thinking they're so smart about thinking this. Then they both turned to me, they ask me the same question. And I just stare at them, hoping that my stare is strong enough to shoot their stupidity out of the both of them. But no, they're still staring at me thinking they are genuinely smart. So I try to explain to them why it wouldn't work as nice as possible. I know these dumb bitches were still saying just breathe, so I snapped you guys are so stupid, how are you gonna breathe in water, you spastic cunts? Suddenly they went quiet. The whole class quiet. Everyone staring at me like I just bombed A bitch. Then I hear someone snickering. I look over to who it is, and it's green. I'd olive.

Having a mother who got pregnant at 18 meant I grew up with a best friend who happened to look like a supermodel and had the relationship ethics of a praying mantis. When I started dating my first boyfriend, Ezra, I was super excited to introduce him my mother. But when I brought him home, mom opened the door wearing her tightest red dress and introduced herself as my sister. Then she laughed when I corrected it to mother and spent the entire dinner flirting with Ezra. I thought whatever and decide to talk it out to her being weird. But then two days later, Ezra texted me saying, sorry, I slept with your mother. It felt like all the energy from my body had disappeared. When I confronted my mom, she said it was just a one time mistake and would never happen again. So I believed her. Two years later, I started dating Stefan from my office. When I brought him to my cousin's wedding, mom monopolized him all night with her hand on his knee. She laughed when I told her to stop and said she was just having fun. So once again, I let it go and once again, she stole him. On our firstly, I came home early with champagne in my hands but found my mother in our bed sitting on top of Stefan. Oh, honey, I was just Testing him for you. Wouldn't you rather know now than after marriage, she said, and I ran away. I moved two hours away and became scared of dating. But that's when I met Danny. He drew hearts in my latte foam and left poetry on my pillow every Sunday morning. We built a quiet life in our tiny apartment where my mother had never set foot. I posted no couple photos and made Danny. I promised to keep our relationship off social media. But at our anniversary dinner, everything collapsed. My mother walked through the door and took Danny's hand before I could warn him. Hello, son, I'm the mom, the premium version of my daughter. That night, I shook in bed while Danny promised nothing would happen. Then two months later, I came home early from work and my heart dropped. My mother's car was in our driveway. I walked inside with heavy footsteps and heard them both through our bedroom door. She'll never love you like I can, Danny. The bed creaked rhythmically while he moaned her name. I slammed against the door until wood splintered and barged in. They didn't even scramble apart. They froze mid act, tangled in our sheets. She pulled his Yankees Jersey down to cover herself while Danny scrambled for a pillow. This isn't what it looks like, Danny said. My mother just smiled, honey, you should thank me. Better you find out now than after marriage. Something inside me shattered completely. I Turned and walked out as Danny called my name, my mother's laughter following me down the stairs. I couldn't eat for days and lived on my bathroom floor until my best friend found me and dragged me to her therapy group, where a woman passed around photos of a guy named Callahan, someone who had destroyed her elderly mother through romance fraud that night.

He's the love of my life. You're just a pathetic substitute keeping his bed warm. When I didn't react, she laughed and said, you're so pathetic, you won't even fight for me. I didn't say anything because, honestly, I was relieved. See, I've been trying to figure out how to break up with Cassandra for months. She was gorgeous, sure, but completely exhausting. Everything was drama. Her job, her family, her friends. Even ordering coffee became this elaborate. I felt like I was dating a tornado. That looked really good in Instagram photos. The wedding planning had been a nightmare. Cassandra wanted everything perfect, which meant nothing was ever good enough. She'd fired three different vendors for not understanding her vision. She made our photographer reshoot our engagement photos four times because her smile didn't look authentic enough in the originals. She spent two hours at cake tape things, complaining that vanilla was too basic, but chocolate was too predictable. But we'd already sent 200 wedding invitations, already put $15,000 in deposits down on the venue, catering, flowers. My parents had flown in from Ohio twice for planning meetings and absolutely adored her. My mom kept talking about what beautiful grandchildren we'd have and had already started shopping for grandmother of the groom dresses. Breaking up would have been this whole nightmare of explanations, returned gifts, awkward conversations with vendors, disappointed family members asking What went wrong? I was basically trapped by logistics and other people's expectations. So when Cassandra drunkenly confessed at her sister's birthday party that she was using me as a placeholder boyfriend, I just nodded and said, okay. She expected me to yell to beg to make some dramatic scene. Instead, I calmly asked, when's he getting out? March, she slurred, looking completely confused by my reaction. Perfect. That gives us three months to play.

I thought it was just a phase until I came home from work one Thursday to find her sitting at our dining room table with a stack of printed papers spread out everywhere.

What they don't know is that I own 17 coffee shops across the state and enough investments to retire tomorrow. Then my parents got the foreclosure notice. Dad called me sobbing, Mia, we're losing the house. Mom's medical bills from her surgery wiped out our savings. We have 30 days or we're homeless. Mom got on the phone, voice breaking, we know you don't have money to help, sweetie. We just wanted you to know what was happening. My heart shattered. For three years, I've been anonymously paying their mortgage and utilities through a property management company. Their assistance program was actually their broke daughter. How much do you need? I asked quietly. 87,000, Dad whispered. We already asked everyone. Your uncle said he'd help with 2,000. But I hung up and drove to their house. When I arrived, the whole family was there. Uncle Robert was explaining why he couldn't help much. Cousin Jennifer was suggesting a go fund. Me, my brother Was on the phone with loan sharks, getting turned down left and right. We'll figure something out, my mom said. But I could see the defeat in her eyes. Dad was holding foreclosure papers with shaking hands. I pulled out my.

Like, no, Emily, you do not have four different mental disorders just because you saw a TikTok that said if you breathe sometimes and also blink, you might have ADHD. Congratulations, that's called being a human. Look, I get it. Mental health awareness is hella important. It's amazing that people are talking about it more openly now. But here's the problem scrolling through hashtags at 2:00am is not the same thing as a professional evaluation. Google is not your therapist. ID Labs tests are not your psychiatrist. And that one influencer who talks about their symptoms in a story time? Definitely not a doctor. When everyone just casually slaps a label on themselves, it waters down the real struggles people actually face. Like someone living with legit OCD is out here battling life every day and then some dude is like oh my god I'm so OCD I color code my closet. No, you're not OCD. You're just organized my guy. And even with depression, just because you're feeling a little sad one week does not mean you have depression. Unless you're diagnosed, I don't wanna hear it. You're free to self pity in private, but self diagnosing is probably one of the most selfish and attention seeking things you can do. Faith out.

My eight year old nephew Cole has always been one of those kids who says weird stuff. Like he'll randomly ask if trees feel pain when you cut them or why adults pretend to like coffee when it tastes like dirt. Normal weird kid things, you know. But last summer at our family barbecue, he said something that made everyone's blood run cold. Uncle Ben was hosting at his house like he always does and's been single forever, lives alone in this old house with a basement he converted into a home office. Super normal guy, coaches little league, brings donuts to work, the whole deal. We never had any reason to think anything was off about him. Cole had been running around with his cousins all afternoon, hot dogs, pool games, typical family stuff. Around 4:00 he disappeared inside to use the bathroom. We figured he was just cooling off from the heat, was gone for maybe 15 minutes. When he came back outside, he walked straight up to where all the adults were sitting and said it. Why does Uncle Ben keep his wife in the basement? Everyone just froze like complete silence. Uncle Ben's face went white as a sheet. My sister Emma laughed first, that nervous kind of laugh you do when something's uncomfortable. Cole, Uncle Ben doesn't have a wife, remember? But Cole just shook his head real serious like, yes, he does. I saw Her through the window. She has long black hair and she waved at me. Uncle Ben tried to play it off. You probably saw a reflection or something, buddy. Maybe the TV was on downstairs. But Cole kept insisting, no, it was a real lady. She looked sad. She pressed her hand against the glass like this. He demonstrated pressing his little palm flat against the patio door. All the adults exchanged those looks, you know, the ones like when you're trying to figure out if a kid is making stuff up or if something's actually wrong. My sister Emma pulled Cole aside and asked him to show her exactly where he saw this woman. He walked her around to the side of the house where there's this tiny basement window that's barely above ground level. It's got bars on it because it's so low right there. Cole pointed. She was sitting on a bed. When she saw me, she got really excited and started waving. Emma looked through the window but couldn't see anything. It was too dark inside. That night, Cole drew a picture, a stick figure woman with long black hair behind bars. The bottom he wrote in his messy eight year old handwriting. She told me not to tell, but I think she needs help. Emma showed me the drawing and my stomach just dropped. Cole had never been in Ben's basement ever. We'd asked him to describe what he saw inside and he mentioned details That were too specific, a purple blanket, a small table with books on it, a bucket in the corner. Emma called the police the next morning. She felt crazy doing it, but something about Cole's story just wouldn't.

So my dad has this mouth like a sailor. Every other word out of his mouth is some form of curse word. He drops F bombs at breakfast, calls drivers idiots when we're in the car, and basically swears more than anyone I know. It's been like this my whole life. Last week I'm in the kitchen making a sandwich and I dropped the Mayo jar. It smashes everywhere and I go, oh, shit, not again. Pretty normal reaction. Action, right? Wrong. My dad comes storming in like I just committed murder. Watch your language, young lady. I don't want to hear that garbage coming out of your mouth again. I just stared at him. This is the same guy who stubbed his toe yesterday and yelled son of a bitch, bastard, piece of shit table loud enough for the neighbors to hear. But somehow me saying shit once is crossing the line. Are you serious right now, dad? Dead serious. You're better than that. That's when I got the idea. If you wanted to please my language, fine. But fair is fair. Okay, dad, you're right. Swearing is bad. So let's all stop starting now. Anyone who swears in this house pays $5 into a jar. Family swear tax. He laughed like it was a joke. Sure, honey, whatever makes you happy. I grabbed an empty pickle jar from the recycling and Wrote swear jar on it with a Sharpie, put it right on the kitchen counter where everyone could see it. Day one was amazing. Dad walks into the kitchen that morning, sees the coffee pot is empty.

Don't get me wrong, I do love a cheeky snack now and then, but how am I supposed to even have a snack when this calorie collector has stored every ounce of happiness in my pantry into his large pocket? God forbid I want to enjoy some Oreos once in a while and not a granola bar. Dead ass. The minute my mom comes home from the store, the whole house starts shaking. This buffet bandit fee fi foe fums his way down the stairs to snatch the full box of gushers, leaving me to nibble up the crumbs left on the shelves. I've resulted to hiding all my snacks under my bed so I can genuinely enjoy a nice bag of chips. It aren't just the crumbs left behind by my veggie virgin of a brother.

If you can use a plastic bottle cap, make a hole in the middle with a tool, put a screw through it, place the cap on the lid and secure it with a nut. Tighten it with a screwdriver and it is fixed. This is the wrong way to connect an alligator clip. You should first pass the wire through the clip, then loop it back, pull it tight, fix it with pliers, then slide the plastic cover onto the handle and it is done. When a wrench is too big to turn a screw, you can use a few small screws to fill the gap and then you can turn the screw easily. First put a zip tie into the hole, place some wooden sticks inside and tap them gently. Then put a hose of the hole and secure it with a zip tie. Cut off the extra part and now the hose is firmly fixed to the ground. If the drill bit is missing, just attach a key to the drill and you can tighten screws in seconds, saving time and effort. When a key just won't go into a key ring, take a pen refill, cut off the end, slide it into the key ring, then pass the key through the refill and into the ring and the key goes uneasily.

So my whole family had been using my Amazon Prime account for like three years. My mom, my sister Ashley, my Uncle Rick, even my grandma somehow figured out how to order stuff. I was paying for it because I actually use Amazon all the time for work stuff and groceries. But they were just leeching off it. The breaking point happened two weeks ago. I check my account and see 17 packages coming to different addresses, 17. Sister ordered a whole workout set she'll never use. My mom got some fancy face cream that cost 60 bucks. And my Uncle Rick ordered a drone he definitely doesn't need. But the worst part was my cousin Blake ordered a gaming chair that cost $400. I called Blake and asked him what the hell he was thinking. He just laughed and said it's not his problem. I gave everyone access. He said if I didn't want people using it, I shouldn't have shared the password. This kid just graduated high school and acts like he runs the world. So I called my mom and told her everyone needed to chip in for prime or get their own accounts. She got all dramatic and said family should help each other out. She reminded me how she used to buy me clothes when I was younger. I told her that was literally her job as a parent and not the same thing at all then Ashley calls me crying, saying she can't afford her own prime account because she's saving for a wedding. I reminded her that her wedding is in two years and she just spent $300 on workout clothes she returned last month. She said I was being petty and that it's only like $10 a month split between everyone. I did the math. If everyone chipped in 10 bucks, that would actually cover prime and give me extra money. But when I suggested this in our family group chat, suddenly everyone had excuses. My mom said she's on a fixed income. Ashley said she's saving for the wedding. Rick said he barely uses it anyway, which is a lie because he ordered protein powder just yesterday. The final straw was when my grandma called me confused about why her soap order got cancelled. Turns out my account got flagged for suspicion, just activity. Because there were so many different addresses, Amazon temporarily locked my account and I couldn't order my medication refills. That's when I snapped. I changed the password and removed everyone's.

Your little girl is asking for you. She's saying she misses daddy. Can't get her to sleep. Hi, Sarah here. Tom's wife. He's sleeping soundly. Need me to wake him? Forget it. Tom, you there? Lily's sick. She's burning up. I'm freaking out and it's pouring. Can't get a ride. Can you take us to the emergency room? Tried to wake him. He's out cold. Work party. He's wasted. Want me to drive you guys? Thanks, I'm good. Fever's no joke. You should get her checked out as soon as possible. I'll figure it out. If you're sure. Jen, Lily had a fever last night. She doing better? Did you hit the emergency room? Now? We stayed home. Shit, I was trashed. Didn't hear my phone. It's cool. Fever's gone now. Just. Just what? She was calling for you all night. Damn glad she's okay. I'll swing by to check on her. You guys eat? Want me to grab something? You still remember what she likes? Of course I do. I'm on my way. I'll bring food. Cool. No cilantro for me. Okay? Got it. Lily's birthday tomorrow. You free? She's been bugging me about you being there. Wouldn't ask, but she won't drop it. He's asleep. Want me to get him? Huh? What do you mean? Why you always on his phone? Don't trust us or something? Nah, just heard it buzz. Didn't want him to miss anything important? Urgent. Should I wake him? Sure. Wake Him up. Tell him Lily needs him now. Babe, what's up? I messed up. Why'd you say that? What's going on? I'm done with your ex texting you 24 seven. Seriously? That's it? You see all our texts? It's just Lily's stuff. If it wasn't for her, we'd never talk. Don't make it a thing. Babe, it's just for Lily. Maybe that's how you see it. I get it. But I feel like she's doing this on purpose, using Lily as an excuse. You've seen everything. It's all about Lily. I trust my gut. When she says Lily misses you, it's really her missing you. Babe, you're overthinking this. Lily's been with us since day one, never been apart. After the split, she's probably struggling without her dad around. That's why she keeps asking for me. But the way Jen texts you, it's off. Like that night Lily was sick. If it was so bad, why'd she blow me off? They didn't even go to the hospital. I thought that since your marriage was already over and the kid wasn't living with you, there wouldn't be any issues between us, you know? Guess I was naive. As long as Lily's around, you and Jen are stuck together. So what do you want me to do? Nothing's happened yet. But who knows down the road? Honestly, I'm at my limit. What do you need? For me to chill? Cut Lily off completely. Never see her again. That make you happy? Stop The crazy thoughts? Lily's just a kid. You want me to be that cold? What are you saying? You're the one who can't handle this. Now I'm feeling insecure, and you're making me sound crazy. I've been super patient this whole time. Then tell me how to fix this. What do you want? Whatever. Let's just take a breather.

Yes. What did he say? He asked how many times we have slept together. Did you respond? Not yet. Omg that's amazing! This is not amazing. Yes it is. Just don't respond to any texts.

I thought it was you. Babe, are you serious? Can I ask you a dirty question? Why would I ever text you that? Rizz app tells me to respond with because you're always leaking.

He knows you were here last week. How? Back door camera. He saw you come at night and leave in the morning. Since when do you have a back door camera? I didn't know. My dad put them in last week. Ah. He keeps texting me. I need to respond. Okay, you need to lie. Say we've never slept together. You sure he will believe that? That's what I always told him. But he knows I spent the night. What should I say we were doing? Just say we watched a movie and slept in different bedrooms. Come on, Rosie, he is never going to believe that. He can't know we've slept together. If he finds out I've slept with anyone, he will send me to a different school. Where would he send you? To that all girls school. He can't do that. Then think of something to say. Okay, I've got this. I see you typing, babe. It's a simple question. Why are you not responding? You know why. Rosie, you're being mean. I am? You ask me how many times we've slept together after our big fight last week. I can't believe you. Rosie, it was just a question. Why won't you just answer it? Because I thought last week was going to be our first time sleeping together. But then I came over to your house and you told me you're secretly dating a girl that goes to that all girls school. And we got in a big fight that lasted all night, and then I left crying in the morning. Oh, now I'm crying again. My dad wants To talk to me. Tell me what you said so I can repeat the same story I told him. We talked all night. Okay, what did we talk about? Your secret girlfriend. My what? She goes to the all girls school. Isn't that genius? How? If he doesn't want you to sleep with anyone, he can't transfer you there.

It's not a prank. Um, we got a call from a girl who had a lot more than dinner with your husband, but all under the impression that he was in open marriage, which he lied about. Oh, when did this happen? This is ridiculous. Um, this happened at his company retreat in Williamsburg. Oh. Oh, great. So that's why he said spouses can't fucking come. Listen, I'm gonna kill him. We just got off the phone with him a minute ago. We can call him back right now if you want to confront him with all this. But you said this is on the radio. Yeah. Oh, I don't think you want to hear what I'm about to say on the radio. What? I mean, listen, we can bleep it all out. We. We have a thing called the bleep button. Um, hang on one second. Let.

In a shocking turn of events, authorities are currently investigating the recent death of 61 year old Joseph Leon. He allegedly died after being caught up in an MRI device like Final Destination movie at an imaging center on Long Island, which could be a case of murder. Leone, who accompanied his wife to NASA Open MRI on July 16th, was violently yanked into the active MRI scanner while wearing a 20 pound metal chain, an object known to be dangerously incompatible with MRI environments. He succumbed to his injuries less than 24 hours later. This wasn't just negligence. We're exploring whether someone intentionally sent Mister Leone into that room knowing full well it could be deadly. According to News 12, the man's wife had just completed a medical scan and needed assistance getting up, so she called her husband in to help her. However, there are many suspicious aspects to this incident. Why did his wife call him into an MRI room even though she knew he was wearing a 20 pound metal necklace? Why did the staff allow him to enter the magnetic room without checking for metal objects on him?

He listened to people's stories, offered encouragement and often forgave fines when life had clearly dealt someone a tough hand. Clips from his courtroom spread across TikTok, YouTube and Facebook, making him an unlikely social media star in his later years. Caprio announced his cancer diagnosis in 2023 and continued to share his journey openly thanking supporters around the world. In his final message from the hospital, he asked for prayers and express gratitude for the love he had received. He leaves behind his wife, Joyce, five children, seven grandchildren and two great grandchildren. Rhode Island governor Dan McKean called him a state treasure and ordered flags to be lowered in his honor. Judge Caprio's legacy is more than viral fame. It is a reminder that justice when tempered with compassion can touch lives far beyond the courtroom. Drop you comments.

So you have zero complaints about the warden burger. Me personally, no. I, I would eat this. Hell, I'm eating it now. The sheriff tells us he's been serving it to inmates in isolation for all three meals for the last several years. This is jail. You don't get to choose. The sheriff tells us that he's not the only one that does this and that detention centers all over the country do this. And it is important to note that the burger is not made to be bad. We do have the recipe for it. It's basically a Turkey burger. The sheriff says that what's punishment about it is that the inmate and isolation get, it's that for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day until they leave isolation. And like you said, he has caught a lot of flack on social media about this. One person even calling him a disgusting human.

The homeowner tell me, tells me it was pretty expensive to build and they're not even sure if it's going to work. But they say after all they've been through, they had to try something. This was Pam and Mark Teters home after Hurricane Milton. The couple had only just moved from North Carolina three months before. And while the flooding from Milton is long gone, the Teters still have standing water on parts of their property from rain storms that happened after. It's tearing up their lives. Pam approached the county several times for help, even offering a few suggestions like building a berm around the retention pond next door or digging their ditches. And that we were the lowest point in this area and that all the water would, would flow to us. That's when they decided to take tens of thousands of dollars out of their savings to build their own burn. It was our last option. We talked to several contractors and they suggested that we do that.

Nothing tops a diamond. Will grew up out there. His uncle was an Arkansas state park employee. So the road trip made sense. And the park superintendent let us know that it was a 2.03 karat Arkansas diamond, second largest found in the park that year. Will showed it to us and the proof it's real.

Subsequently, the Marine show management called in veterinarians to check on the orca. Upon examination, they announced that the orca was severely unwell. The orca, which is a type of dolphin, is known to think like humans and possesses a highly advanced brain. It felt ashamed of its mistake. After that, the orca suddenly went underwater and did not resurface. When two hours passed without it coming up for air, the Marine show management called in veterinarians again. The team checked on the orca and found that its breathing had ceased. It had passed away. The Marine show management incurred a loss of $200 million in a week because they paid $50 million in compensation to Jessica's family, while the orca itself was valued at $150 million.

So you have zero complaints about the warden burger. Me personally, no. I, I would eat this. Hell, I'm eating it now. The sheriff tells us he's been serving it to inmates in isolation for all three meals for the last several years. This is jail. You don't get to choose. The sheriff tells us that he's not the only one that does this and that detention centers all over the country do this. And it is important to note that the burger is not made to be bad. We do have the recipe for it. It's basically a Turkey burger. The sheriff says that what's punishment about it is that the inmate and isolation get, it's that for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day until they leave isolation. And like you said, he has caught a lot of flack on social media about this. One person even calling him a disgusting human.

Pam approached the county several times for help, even offering a few suggestions, like building A berm around the retention pond next door, or digging their ditches. And that we were the lowest point in this area, and that all the water would. Would flow to us. That's when they decided to take tens of thousands of dollars out of their savings to build their own burn. It was our last option.

Thirty two year old Kenneth White was driving his van on the interstate when suddenly a seven pound rock flew down from an overpass striking white in the head and chest. Father of four died instantly. The perpetrators were four teenagers aged between 15 and seventeen. In court they yelled and danced around thinking they'd soon be released because of their young age. When their defense lawyer tried to convince the judge to prosecute them as juveniles, the judge firmly denied the request saying the proposal for juvenile sentencing is rejected. Claws erupted from the victim's family. Now these teenagers will be tried as adults facing potential life sentences. Do you support the judge's decision? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

As she slurs her words, are you an Uber driver? He put his hands around her waist. What company? Oh, lift, lift it. Lift, lift. Yes. Yeah. I just wanna make sure you get home safely. Lauren Christensen says she was heading home after a night out with friends in Dallas. Just had the most amazing night. There's a lot of drinks involved. So her friend ordered a lift to take her home. She never imagined she would get groped. The lift driver didn't park his car outside of Lauren's house. He actually parked it down the street. One of Lauren's neighbors went outside to check out the suspicious car and heard the commotion on Lauren's front porch and went to see if everything was okay. Steve, I love you so much. You're welcome. I just want to make sure everything's alright. I told him, listen, I said, that's my neighbor and I'm watching over her. And he took off. Do you feel your neighbor saved you? Absolutely.

The homeowner tell me, tells me it was pretty expensive to build and they're not even sure if it's going to work. But they say after all they've been through, they had to try something. This was Pam and Mark Teters home after Hurricane Milton. The couple had only just moved from North Carolina three months before. And while the flooding from Milton is long gone, the Teters still have standing water on parts of their property from thunderstorms that happened after. It's tearing up their lives. Pam approached the county several times for help, even offering a few suggestions like building a berm around the retention pond next door or digging their ditches. And that we were the lowest point in this area and that all the water would, would flow to us. That's when they decided to take tens of thousands of dollars out of their savings to build their own burn. It was our last option. We talked to several contractors and they suggested that we do that.

Known around the world as America's Nicest Judge, Caprio turned a local courtroom in Providence, Rhode Island into a stage for compassion, kindness, and humanity. Through his reality show, caught in Providence, Caprio became a global sensation. Millions watched as he handled parking tickets and minor violations not just with the law in mind, but with heart. He listened to people's stories, offered encouragement, and often forgave fines when life had clearly dealt someone a tough hand. Clips from his courtroom spread across TikTok, YouTube, and Facebook, making him an unlikely social media star. In his later years, Caprio announced his cancer diagnosis in 2023 and continued to share his journey openly, thanking supporters around the world. In his final message from the hospital, he asked for prayers and express gratitude for the love he had received. He leaves behind his wife Joyce, five children, seven grandchildren, and two great grandchildren. Rhode Island Governor Dan Mckee called him a state treasure and ordered flags to be lowered in his honor. Judge Caprio's legacy is more than viral fame. It is a reminder that justice, when tempered with compassion, can touch lives far beyond the courtroom. Drop you comments.

He allegedly died after being caught up in an MRI device like Final Destination movie at an imaging center on Long Island, which could be a case of murder. Leone who accompanied his wife to NASA open MRI on July 16th was violently yanked into the active MRI scanner while wearing a 20 pound metal chain, an object known to be dangerously incompatible with MRI environments. He succumbed to his injuries less than 24 hours later. This wasn't just negligence. We're exploring whether someone intentionally sent Mister Leone into that room knowing full well it could be deadly. According to News 12, the man's wife had just completed a medical scan and needed assistance getting up. So she called her husband in to help her. However, there are many suspicious aspects to this incident. Why did his wife call him into an MRI room even though she knew he was wearing a 20 pound metal necklace? Why did the staff allow him to enter the magnetic room?

But when people found out what the two of them were doing inside that house, it was so disturbing that the police were called immediately. Jonas, a 30 year old man, lived with his mother in an isolated house in Texas. The house was dark, filthy, and filled with an unbearable stench. Neighbors avoided even walking past it. For years, no one had stepped inside. They had no friends, no relatives. Just the two of them, living together since forever. But in recent months, something started drawing attention. Strange noises, muffled screams, and shadowy figures spotted through the cracks in the windows. Until one day, a city inspector was sent to the property. When he opened the door, what he saw made him run out in panic. What Jonas and his mother were doing inside that house was so vile, so absurd, that even the police officers on the scene were left in shock. Wanna know what they discovered? Comment? Family for part two.

They got to their terminal and had about 15 minutes before the next leg of their journey, but the wife insisted she wanted coffee and the husband offered to get it from the market right next to their gate. He insisted, however, on going to Starbucks, which was nowhere near their gate. He told her they did not have enough time but she went anyway without him. As the plane was boarding, this husband called his wife four times to ask where she was. She finally answered on the fourth call and said that she was on her way back to the terminal and that the line at Starbucks was exceptionally long. The husband went ahead and boarded the plane after the gate agent said they couldn't hold up the flight. He full on left his wife behind.

He allegedly died after being caught up in an MRI device like Final Destination movie at an imaging center on Long Island, which could be a case of murder. Leone who accompanied his wife to NASA open MRI on July 16th was violently yanked into the active MRI scanner while wearing a 20 pound metal chain, an object known to be dangerously incompatible with MRI environments. He succumbed to his injuries less than 24 hours later. This wasn't just negligence.

Why did the staff allow him to enter the magnetic room without checking for metal objects on him?

All these remarks leading up to Saturday. She left Saturday ostensibly to meet her co workers, but in reality to the guy. I asked her to text me when she was leaving for the bar. And when she did, I asked her if she was really going to go through with this. After her response, quote, I'm not answering any more questions tonight. I will see you tomorrow, I blocked my wife. Then I did something either stupid or brilliant. I went to the bar where the get together was happening. Well, not the bar, but a transit bench across the street. I waited for a long time. It was running through my mind the leading up to this event that I need to know who this guy was, maybe to compare myself against him to see what he had that I do not. It was driving me crazy not knowing who he was and what was so special about him that she would ruin our marriage for. After what seemed like an eternity, a woman that I recognized from my wife's office left the bar and got in a cab. Soon other people started filing out and a whole group came out and people were hugging a man and shaking his hand. I assumed that I had my guy. I didn't see my wife and had a brief thought that maybe she called it off. I unblocked her and there were No messages. Everyone said their goodbyes and left. Dude was standing outside for a few minutes and then my wife came out. She looked around, took his hand and started walking away together. Of all the emotions I went through, trepidation, sadness, anger, it was disgust that really encapsulated the event for me. This guy was short, fat and bald. All the things I cannot compete with. Ultimately, I felt like a pervert for watching from a distance. I followed until they got to the hotel and then turned around and went home. I woke up Sunday morning and put a lock on the master bedroom door. I moved her things to the spare room and left a note asking her to find other accommodations as quickly as possible. I visited another friend who was a lawyer and he gave me some sage advice and a couple of recommendations for divorce attorneys and made the introductions. My wife has been calling me numerous times since around 11 or so. Once blocked the calls go to voicemail. I listened to the first couple but felt nothing but some satisfaction when she couldn't get through to me. And she was obviously becoming concerned. So proud of him. I didn't want to go home, but I left in such a hurry that I didn't plan an overnight properly. I got home around 9 and as per my buddy's advice, I record recorded the interaction. I was halfway up the stairs when she came. Up from the family room asking what was going on, could we talk? I thought we talked about this. I just answered with, I'm not interested in discussing this tonight and went to bed. After not getting a response from me through the door, she left me alone. I kind of feel like a child for not talking with her and shutting the door on her. But I just couldn't look at her. Monday, I got up and got ready for work. She was waiting for me and asked if we could discuss getting back to normal. I said you have been doing all of the talking for the both of us for the last week. Why don't you continue? And left for work. I have an appointment with the attorneys my friend recommended for this week. I love this. She fucked around and she's finding out. Yep.

My wife and I have been married since 2001 and together since 1999. She's the most intelligent, thoughtful, caring, loyal person I know. And I've always thought of myself as fortunate to have met and married her. She is even today aesthetically beautiful. And men have told her this throughout our marriage. She has always shot them down. Earlier this year, she was diagnosed with uterine cancer stage 1 and had a full hysterectomy. I was never concerned about the cancer. It was diagnosed early, dealt with quickly and she made a full, full recovery. I took time off work to look after her after the surgery and all seemed well. There were some to be expected emotional instances on her part and although I am not an emotional person, we dealt with them together. After her recovery, she was insistent that we start living life to the fullest and took a 10 day trip to Europe followed by a trip to Belize. We also have a trip to the UK and Spain slash Portugal later this year. I'm fine with these things, building memories and crossing bucket list adventures off her slash our list. I also understand that these are a result of feeling fragile on her part. She also took up yoga, swimming and healthy cooking classes. I was fully on board until last week. Last week she came home from Work and told me she wanted a hall pass, a one time opportunity for her to have with someone else besides me. She said that since her cancer diagnosis, her outlook on life has changed and she doesn't wanna be handcuffed from doing things she wants to do. She explained that there is this guy at her work and she has always had some attraction to him. He is leaving the company and she will never see him again. So this is the perfect opportunity to sleep with someone else. She said that I could say no, of course, but that she would, quote, be mad slash disappointed at me for an undetermined amount of time and that it would be confirmation of my male toxicity and insecurity. I don't consider myself to be toxic and if not wanting your wife of 20+ years to have with someone else is insecure, then I guess I'm insecure. I told her that I appreciated her talking to me about this, but approval via coercion is not approval. I also said that I do not appreciate her language in describing.

We decided that we wanted a nice but simple ceremony and reception with our friends and relatives. Lucas convinced me to invite my parents and brother, but they never responded to the invite. And whenever I went to visit and began to talk about my wedding without mentioning it was a wedding, my mom would always speak over me about my brother's accomplishments and wild adventures. At one point, I got fed up with it and interrupted my mom to tell her that there was an event I was planning whose date was unmovable. She told me that they couldn't attend because my brother was playing the last game of the season that very same day. Hmm. And they wanted to be there for that, of course. Of course. This favoritism doesn't surprise me. They missed my ballets shows and both my high school and university graduation for things about him. At this point, I wanted to be petty. I told both my parents that it wasn't a problem to miss this event, purposely omitted the fact that this event was my wedding, and didn't insist further. Flash forward to a few weeks ago. I got married. It was perfect. My family, Lucas's family, and our friends were all there, and we had a blast. My Grandpa was happy to give me away, and it was just perfect. My relatives asked me multiple times why my parents weren't There with us. I was honest and simply said they had my brother's game to attend and couldn't come. They gave me a few looks and my grandpa was visibly angry for a while, but otherwise nothing strange happened. After the reception, Lucas and I left for our honeymoon, and we were phone free for the whole duration of the trip. But once we got back, we discovered that a shitstorm was welcoming us home. Yes, I turned my phone on and was unable to even unlock it before a storm of notifications popped up. Most of them were from my mother and brother. Mike called me all sorts of nasty names and insulted me because apparently one of my paternal aunts posted the photos of the wedding on Facebook and caption it with a very obvious dig at my parents. Nice. Especially my mom for missing the wedding. The post apparently went viral and

Buckle up guys, this will be kind of long. So I, 27 female, have a younger brother, Mike, 21 male. He is the definition of a man child and a mama's boy. Always complaining, always expecting others to bow to him. Just overall an asshole. Ever since he was born, my parents fussed over him for everything. He's not special needs or had a traumatic birth or anything of the sort. He was just born and my parents completely discarded me. My mom, 50 female, especially. She went from being a loving mother to one of those boy moms that people make fun of on the internet. My father, 50 male, still showed me love and support, but he's always been too much of a coward to stand up to my mother and let me win at least once. The only one who stood up for me was my grandpa, 76 male, who always called my parents out on their bullshit and never liked my brother. I reminded him of his late wife. My grandma and we have a very special bond, but he lives on the other side of the country and I could never see him that often. Mike knows our mom prefers him and loves to shove it in my face. Because of this and his behavior, we've always been at odds. He's spoiled, a brat, and an awful Human. I can't remember how many times I ended up in trouble for things I did better than him. Or for things he framed me with. His only talents are his football skills. He won a scholarship to a nice college out of state. My parents didn't spend a dime on my education because apparently my fund had been used to cover expenses after a fire. Just for me to discover years later that said money was given to Mike to buy a car and a house. It's at public university that I met Lucas. He was the first person I was really drawn to. There, of course, I met new people who are now my dearest friends. And thanks to them and Lucas, who was my best friend for years before we got together, I managed to move out of my parents house. Now both Lucas and I are well known in our fields and have very good salaries. Now to the main issue. Lucas proposed to me a year ago. We're very private people so we didn't post it on social media or anything. And when I told my parents, they dismissed it with a quote, that's nice.

My 27 female husband, Tim, 36 male, has a serious dairy allergy. I'm talking about an actual immune system reaction, not intolerance. I work full time and also have some seasonal work this holiday season because Tim has been without work and money has been very tight. As a result, I barely get to rest. The holidays are especially hard, and I found myself getting just one day off every two weeks for almost two months straight. Damn. As you can imagine, that day off means the universe to me now. Tim loves dairy and will sometimes intentionally eat things which trigger his allergy. Lately it's gotten out of hand. In fact, it always seemed to coincidentally line up with my time off and I found myself spending my one day taking care of him. Hmm. Last week I finally asked him if he was intentionally timing it to line up with my day off. I fully expected him to say no, he admitted that he was doing it to make sure that he'd have a nurse and so he'd have someone close by in case he had an especially adverse reaction and needed a hospital. I was livid. I said that if he made himself sick again, I wouldn't take care of him. He didn't say much, so I thought he'd heard me. Fast forward to Friday night. I get Home from work and a few minutes in, Tim gets a pizza delivered. I asked him why when I'm making dinner and he shrugs. I ask if a large garlic Alfredo pizza is worth the pain and remind him that I won't be giving up my rest day again. He smirks and eats an entire

He was always very competent living alone and I don't appreciate him forgetting how to do chores. I said that when I asked him to do dishes and he refused and refused until he finally did them wrong, that I was not stupid. He said that he was trying his best and I was wrong for saying he was trying to manipulate me, and that from his perspective, I asked him to do something and he did it the best he could and I kept at him because it wasn't up to my impossibly high standards so he couldn't win and he wanted me to believe him when he says he is trying anyways. This might be petty, but I decided to give believe in him a try. So he had bleach stained my favorite little black dress. Instead of getting mad next time he had a family event, I put it on. He asked me if I was really going to wear that. It looked messy. I said that I loved that dress and understand accidents happen, so I wasn't mad or upset. It had bleach spots. Actually, I thought it looked kind of cool. He said he really thought it looked bad, and I said if he wants, he could sharpie on the white spots real quick. In the Uber. It ended up looking even worse. He did it. Wow.

Our oldest rode the bus for the first time. My wife was waiting at the stop with our daughter and had her hand the bus driver a bag of homemade cookies. Then when she picked her up from the stop in the afternoon, she gave a bag to the afternoon driver. I asked why she did that when she could easily just have said thank you and left it at that. She said the bus drivers work so hard having to comfort all the nervous kids and handling the unruly ones while driving. They deserve more than a thanks. I reminded her that this has embarrassed me in the past and I think her behaviors are too extreme. I wouldn't want gifts from someone I don't know. She ignored how I felt. I contacted some people in my life to see if I was just crazy and most of my friends and my mom agree. My wife's way of showing thanks just makes everyone uncomfortable. Am I the asshole? Yeah, you are. You Mousy, unforgettable man. Of course, your friends and your family are going to like validate what you're feeling. What do you mean? That's the nicest thing ever.

Oh, man. Hello. I'm a 29 year old, happily married. My husband and I are college educated, have respectable, stable jobs, own a home in a nice neighborhood. We're basically as prepared as anyone can be to start a family. I'm almost nine months pregnant with our first child. The problem is that 11 years ago when my husband was a freshman in college, he was arrested for possession of marijuana. He pled guilty and did his time in probation without a problem, passing every drug test along the way. He has not touched any other illegal substance since and we rarely even drink and haven't at all in over a year. I have no criminal record. It was a stupid mistake he made as a foolish 18 year old and he's worked hard to put it behind him. Someone has apparently contacted child services in our area. This accusation is being taken very seriously because of my husband's record. We have been as cooperative as could be with our case worker. We've been interviewed. Our home has been examined and she found nothing remotely serious or incriminating. We have both taken tests and passed. Our case worker says everything looks just fine so far. Unfortunately, she also says that there's still the possibility that our child could be taken from us in the labor and delivery ward. I was devastated and horrified to hear that when I asked Why she said it was, quote, not up to her and we'll have to wait and see.

People like to do it because it's satisfying, it gives an improved look. Very temporarily, though, because within 24 hours, all this oil is going to start returning. Does it hurt? So just a little bit of tenderness the patient is mentioning. So hopefully good skin prep makes these come out easier. Steaming the face or using a chemical peel of some kind to kind of soften up the top of them. Beta hydroxy acid, like salicylic acid, would be very good to help soften up the top. It does penetrate through that oil a little bit. Getting a lot of stuff out. Again, just not critical to remove these. The skin's a little bit congested. That's where good skincare is going to come in handy. Salicylic acid and retinol. I keep harping on these, but they are some of the best for these non inflammatory blackheads, whiteheads, and sebaceous filaments. And they just keep going, getting a lot of stuff out of there.

They have a ton of great videos on their page. These are all coming from TikTok. And then follow that up with good skincare. Try to prevent these from coming back.

Looks like we're dealing with a ton of blackheads. This right here is another pimple poppers paradise. And we see that little inscription on the gloves. We know this is gonna be a good one. This person is absolutely clinical with those gloves. I have some bad news for all of you. You may be wondering how on earth somebody gets so many blackheads like this in patches. This is actually a condition called favus rosacea syndrome and it happens due to excessive sun exposure. So when you're not wearing your sunscreen or you spend your lifetime in the sun, you end up with these patches of blackheads on the face. So using sunscreen, retinol and salicylic acid is really the best way to prevent these patches of blackheads. This one just keeps going. Oh, another patch. This is one of the best ones I've seen in a long time, 10 out of ten.

And then they just let go of it for absolutely no reason, and now it's sliding back through the tongue. First of all, this technique makes absolutely no sense. Whatever this is is clearly longer on the bottom than it is on the top. So why not just pull it through the bottom? The tongue is not that thick. Now they're irrigating it or cleaning it with some type of fluid. Second attempt here. Okay, this is clearly fake.

Before she took on the iconic role, there was another young actress named Carol Richard, an enigmatic talent with a unique charm and a devoted fan base. But just as Carol's star was rising, she mysteriously vanished without a trace. No scandals, no goodbyes, only silence. Rumors whispered about broken contracts and pressure from powerful industry figures who wanted to reshape the narrative. Soon after, Jenna appeared, a polished, poised presence perfectly suited for the role and seemingly stepping right into Carol's shoes. Fans began noticing eerie similarities. Jenna's style choices and even subtle mannerisms echoed Carol's signature traits. Some claim Jenna's performance carries echoes of Carol's artistry, as if she was molded to fill a space left by someone erased. Theories suggest that Carol was quietly removed from the spotlight, replaced by Jenna in a calculated move by industry powers to craft the perfect Gen Z icon. This hidden story raises questions about the cost of fame.

In the 2, Britney Spears was followed by dozens of paparazzi every single day. It didn't matter if she was with her kids in the car or heading to the bathroom. She wasn't allowed to make mistakes because every slip became a headline. Every tear was a new opportunity to sell newspapers. The covers read, Britney lost control, but no one asked why. No one saw that she was a young mother, tired, watched, judged, living in a prison made of flash bulbs. After losing custody of her children, Britney walked into a salon in Los Angeles. She sat down, looked in the mirror, and shaved her head alone, clippers in hand, while security begged her to stop. The next night, she was surrounded by photographers at a gas station. She stepped out of the car holding an umbrella and struck the window of one of their vehicles. The image went global, and everyone said, she went crazy. She needs help. It's the end. But no one asked what she was feeling. She screamed, but not with her voice. She screamed with her eyes, with her shaved head, with that umbrella. And the world took pictures. Months later, Britney was forcibly institutionalized. She lost the right to control her own life, her assets, her career, her decisions. All taken from her. She became the legal prisoner of her own name. And the world only understood Over a decade too late.

Her name was Amy Winehouse, the woman who brought soul back to the charts. The raspy voice, the iconic eyeliner, and the lyrics that screamed for help disguised as music. From a young age, she battled addiction. But while she begged for help, the industry begged for more shows, more tours, more money. Instead of treatment, she got flash bulbs and contracts. Her breakdowns became memes. Her relapses headlines. Her Pain. Entertainment. In 2,011, at just 27, Amy stepped onto the stage in Belgrade. She was disoriented, stumbling over her own words. The crowd booed, but no one stopped the show. She was taken offstage, but it was already too late. Her final performance became global humiliation, and no one really looked at her. Weeks later, she was found lifeless at home with four times the fatal limit of alcohol in her blood. Alone in the same house where she had recorded so many songs about loneliness. They say she died from excess, but maybe she died from abandonment. And even now, years after her last chord, on every corner of London and every scratched vinyl, Amy's voice still echoes, begging for someone to finally listen.

Before the hooks, before fame, he was just Nathan Hale, a pastor's son at church chorister, who sang about heaven, but lived in the hell of the streets of Long Beach, served in the army, and returned to the neighborhood without medals, without a job. So he, Snoop and Warren G formed a group, 2:13, recorded a tape in the basement. And someone took that tape to Doctor Dre. That's when everything changed. Nate didn't rhyme, but when he opened his mouth, everyone listened. He became the sound of the West Coast, the soul of G funk. He didn't need verses. Just one line, a melody, and the world stop, regulate, Lay Low. The next episode. Area codes. All the hits with the same label behind them, featuring Nate Dogg. But as his voice soared, his body fell. Heart attack. Then another. And more. Another. In 2011, he left silent, without applause, without a farewell chorus. But every time you hear that hold up or smoke weed, every day, he's the one there. Nate Dog didn't need a stage because he was the foundation of everyone's music. He wasn't the star, he was the foundation. The bridge between gangster rap and melody. Between the ghetto and eternity.

Small holes in the zip ties and you've got yourself an automatic watering system. When something valuable falls into dirty water, don't reach in with your hands. Fill a clear plastic bag with water. Do it like this. It's a simple trick. You can easily spot the item inside and pick it up straight from the bag. No dirty hands. Super quick to find really. Tear off a strip of tape and stick it on the heel and sole of your shoe. This way you won't slip while walking. Take two hangers and hook them on both sides of the skirt. Step your feet in and you can slip the skirt on directly. Lay some foil over the drain opening, add glue and place a chain on top. Once the glue hardens, peel off the foil and you've made a drain stopper. Twist off the cap of a plastic bottle, cut the bottle in half, use a drill bit to carefully make small holes along the bottle. Thread straws and colourful thread through the holes and place them inside. Screw the cap back on and your little sewing kit is ready. Cut a piece of foam pipe, secure it to the wall with screws and you've got yourself a screwdriver holder. Fix a blade onto the wall, place zip ties on both ends of the blade and form a circle. Slide the pipe through the circle and the pipe will stay In place, step on a stool with your slippers. Screw in some screws, put the slippers back on, and you can reach up to clean the high wall.

But let me tell you about the 9 1 1 call for somebody's 400 pound mama on top of a refrigerator. So grab your popcorn, put down the liquids and hold on to your ass. It is day shift and I'm on duty cause two people that don't even like each other no more or robbed around in the 90s and now I got bills I did not ask for the 3 digit Houston, we have a problem. Line starts going off and I answer, thank you for calling Crackhead County 9 1 1. You're on the air. What is your emergency today? And the man on the other end says, I think I need an ambulance over here cause my mama done lost her whole damn head today. So I, I asked him what the hell might his mama be doing on this fine afternoon that would require the activation of my sweet little trauma llamas. His response, this fucking 400 pound half done took some of them pills from the summer 69 and now she is tripping and she has climbed on top of my fridge today and will not come down. And in the background I hear woman holler there's a little man up here with me. To which my caller replies, ain't a damn thing little up there. I collect as much information as I can from the caller And I go ahead and EMS along with a couple officers started that direction just to cover my trauma llama 6. And as soon as my fucking tone dropped, I hear a boom, bang, crash on the other end. So I asked my caller if everything is okay over there. And he tells me that Mama is now off of the refrigerator but now through the floor. My brother in Christ, I need you to speak fucking further cause what the hell do you mean she is through the floor? Apparently Mama was trying to remove articles of clothing, rolled off, took the whole damn frigidaire down with her and fell clean through the kitchen floor onto the ground under the house. So my higher than alien balls call has now just turned into an entrapment by frigidare and in need of an extraction. So I go ahead and tone out the fire department.

Got out of another ticket but was pulled over by one of the finest deputies I have ever had the pleasure of being pulled over by. And I have proof. So let me tell you all about it. Let me just show you all the hot stuff I was working with real quick. So there I am making a right hand turn from the highway onto a road. And I get down there a little up in my little rearview and I see blueberries and cherries behind me. And I don't think I have fucked up this right hand turn. I don't think I have done anything at all. So my next conclusion was that there is an emergency and I need to get the fuck out of the way. And this is a two lane road so I really can't pull over anywhere. But the Walgreens driveway was right there, so that's where I pull over. But it wasn't until the blueberries and cherries pulled in behind me that I started thinking we might have miscalculated some somewhere between the stoplight and here. Cause the math ain't mathing right now as to why I'm being pulled over. I throw the car in park and I see old boy get out the unit and I see the stone cold steel look on his face and I'm like well shit, I'm about to owe this county some money today. Cause 9 times out of 10 when they get out The car with that stone cold look on their face. You better have to take a defensive driving class. Oh, boy. Gives up to my window, gives me his name, the agency he's with, and the reason I'm being pulled over today. And I immediately noticed that this man is insanely attractive. And my brain suddenly goes to all the ways that I could get this man to throw me in cuffs today. He asked for my ID, I hand it to him, and he goes back to the unit to run it, which is when I got the video for y'all. And I guess I wouldn't want to, cause he brought me my ID back, but when he did, he goes, hey, aren't you a CEO? And I said, I used to be, yeah. And he goes, that's pretty cool. Stop driving like one. And hands me my ID back. So, uh, Officer Evans with the Hayes County Sheriff's Office. Number one, sir, I wanna say thank you for not giving me a ticket. Number two, you are finer than a hooker's paycheck after a holiday weekend. And number three, I'm trying to find out your status. So, uh, I hope you see this.

It's not happening. Oh please. Iran's defense budget is like 15 billion to the Pentagon. That's just another Tuesday. Our defense budget is so big that we once spent $84 million on a gas station in Afghanistan and we forgot about it. The Pentagon's probably got a secret program just to buy pens and those probably cost more than Iran submarines. By the end of the first week we would have already opened up a Waffle House and probably at least three dollar generals fully staffed Irans like we have ballistic missiles. Cool story bro. We have space lasers in a guy in Florida building drones from shit he bought at Bass Pro Shop. By the time I ran launches their first missile, we would have already deployed two carriers, launched 3,000 drones, Hack Iran's Wi-Fi and drop leaflets with Doordash coupons saying if you surrender now you'll get free curly fries.

It is a full moon at dispatch. I think Mercury's back in reverse cowgirl and it's a Friday night. My dispatchers are gonna understand what kind of fresh hell that is. I have already taken several bullshit calls and my 9 1 1 line starts going off. I answer and the woman on the other end is just absolutely frantic. She's screaming, she's crying so I have to get her to calm down so she can tell me what's going on. I finally get her to calm down enough, ask her what's going on and she tells me her husband is laying in the bed not conscious, not breathing. So I go through a whole slew of medical questions with her and then I ask her what he was doing beforehand so I can relay very accurate information to EMS and her response kind of confuses the fuck out of me a little bit because she said he was just sitting here having a good time. My sister in Christ, i'mma need you to elaborate so much fucking further. And she tells me that at the time of expiration she was giving the hubby a little golf ball through a garden hose maneuver And at one point she noticed that his eyes were closed and that he wasn't moving, but she didn't think anything of it. So she kept going. And after 45 minutes, she realized that he wasn't finishing because he himself was in fact finished. I mean, I understand the dedication, but after 45 minutes, my ass is telling old boy to tag in Rosie, Palm, her five sisters and some lotion. So I get EMS dispatched and I walk old girl through CPR so she can perform life saving efforts until EMS can get on scene. EMS lets me know that they're on scene and they are gonna be taking over CPR. I get off the phone with her and 30 minutes later, EMS comes on the radio, let me know to call for a justice of the peace and whatever funeral home we have on call. And after all was said and done, one member of the EMS crew came back to dispatch and told me that the soldier was still in fact at attention when they got there and that she didn't know how the hell the wife was still walking cause apparently old boy was in possession of a deadly weapon. It wasn't funny at the time, but it's been almost a decade so I can laugh about it now. Gentlemen, y'all be careful when y'all ask us what that mouth do, cause some of them really do take souls.

Con Artist County 9 1 1, what is your emergency? And the person on the other end is screaming and crying and tell me I need somebody. This building. I look on my little map to see where the call is originating from, and it is coming from a mechanic shop. Okay, calm down, my little Cadillac convertible culprit. Why can you not get out of the building? And through snotsaves old boy tells me. I crawled in through the window of this building to see if there was anything good in here to take home. And now I'm trapped by an alligator. I beg your finest. Pardon? Did you just say an alligator? Yeah. It's got me trapped in the corner and I don't know how to get it away from me. Do I just hit it? What do I do? My brother in Christ, do not bear knuckle box Godzilla's third cousin. Cause I do not foresee that as a match you will win. However, I do foresee you losing parts that you are very attached to. But don't worry, I'm sending Crocodile Dundee and the Goon Squad your way.

And sure as shit it was a very large lizard. Cause Crocodile Dundee comes back over my radio to tell me that we are gonna need the cast to swamp people to get Rango's older brother out. Listen my little park ranger, there are only two groups I know to call for this and that is the Cajun Navy and people from Florida. But I'll do what I can. I wound up calling game boards from other jurisdictions. But they came and they got the 12 foot swamp monster out and oh boy. Well let's just say he wound up going to jail for breaking and entering.

Who would have thought that after getting Luca that they would soon move to the second best team in the west, which automatically makes them a top 5 team in the league. I'm just saying. With the Nuggets losing to the Celtics earlier today, the Lakers have a chance to move to the second seed in the west if they win tonight. They play the Los Angeles Clippers. They already beat them once, they should beat them again. But hey, it's hard to beat a team twice. And definitely back to back, the rockets were ahead of them and the Grizzlies were ahead of them, got past the rockets and the Grizzlies have been four out of six out of the last 10 games and are on a two game losing streak, which automatically moves Lakers to right behind the Nuggets. But the Nuggets have two more wins in them, but also have one more loss and are only point five games ahead of the Lakers. So again, if the Lakers win the night, which they should, they will now be the second team in the west, sorry, second seeded team in the west. And the scariest thing about this, I've already said it before, Luca has not shot a game over 50% with the Los Angeles Lakers yet. So the Lakers aren't even at full force. We haven't even really seen Luca yet. Yes, Luca had 32, 10 and 7. He's been having really Good games.

It's like, there's nothing wrong with the girl being short, you know, they be looking good and shit. But it's just from a business standpoint, like, I want my sons in the fucking NBA. We gotta start making business decisions and moving smart like y'all mean. And look, I'm not saying you can't have fun with whoever you wanna have fun with. I'm just saying when it comes time to put a ring on it and to start having kids.

Is the greatest of all time, but LeBron James is the best of all time. There is a difference. Michael Jordan is the greatest because of what he accomplished, 6 for 6 in the finals, never letting a series go to a Game 7, collecting tens scoring titles, a Defensive Player of the year award and turning basketball into a global phenomenon. Greatness is about legacy and nobody's resume touches MJ's. He dominated the nineties in a way nobody else ever has dominated an era by elevating the Bulls into a dynasty and making himself the face of the sport worldwide. That resume, that cultural impact is what makes Jordan the greatest. But best is different. Best is about the actual basketball player. LeBron James is the most complete player the game has ever seen. At 6 9, 250 pounds, he's basically what you build in 2K if you were designing the perfect player. He can score inside and out. He's one of the greatest players of all time. He rebounds at an elite level and he can defend every position on the court. And he's still doing it in year 22, putting up all NBA numbers against players half his age. If you have a hot take you want me to defend, message me on Instagram.

But hey, I played against the next Michael Jordan in high school and I realized this world isn't fair. So we were a very small school, right? We never really played like big time names like Anthony Edwards. So of course, we knew that we were gonna play him since the beginning of the year for about two weeks before we ended up playing him. We were just game planning for him in every single practice. It comes game day, all my teammates are watching film on him, you know, getting hyped to play him, everything thinking that they're gonna have a legacy game. I'm over here. I don't care. I'm a freshman on varsity that gets zero playing time. So I go out of the locker room to analyze the situation to see if it has showed up, bro. Guess what? No one is there. We had overtime, ball is life, but no Anthony Edwards. Matter of fact, the entire team didn't show up until about 10 minutes before the game. Everyone shows up, right? Everyone is there except one person, Anthony Edwards. We have light up lines, like four more minutes until the game starts Anthony Edwards comes walking through the door with a hoodie on, listening to music, recording himself, not even warming up or anything. Two more minutes until tip off. My team is getting on.

Marion set his career high with that 60 ball, but he also set a franchise record with that 60 ball. He is now scored the most points in a single game in franchise history for the Kings.

Imagine if he never came back. That is who Maya Moore is. You might be wondering why didn't she come back? Read the caption, that man robbed us. Let's do a quick history lesson of who the real goat of the W is. Maya Moore has 4 rings, four NBA championships, along with a 2,013 Finals MVP, regular season MVP in 2,014, seven time All NBA selection and has been selected to the all star team six times. And she was the MVP of that game three times. And did I mention she won back to back titles at Yukon also in high school. She won three straight championships. But after eight years in the WNBA, she chose to step away and stick to prison reform to work on her now husband who was wrongfully convicted and he was in prison. She got him out. So, yes, she did what she had to do. However, in eight seasons, like I said, she's did all that. She averaged 18, 6 and 3 her entire career, which was 271 games. And this is the rest of her accolades. I'm, I'm not reading all that, but I just want y'all to understand.

Donovan Mitchell. No, it's not Donovan Mitchell. That's good though. Good guess. Carmelo Anthony. It's Carmelo Anthony. And who do you lose to? LeBron. LeBron James. Let's pull up the stats because I actually think Mello statistically had a better rookie season. Really? Okay, let's look at him. Carmelo Anthony's rookie season average 21 points per game, 6.1 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 1.2 steals. He shot 42.6% from the floor and 32% from three. LeBron average 20.9 points per game, 5.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists. He shot 41.7, 29% from three and then 75% from the line. Okay, mellow is 77.7% for the line. And the Nuggets had more team success. They did. So should Mello have won that rookie of the year? This debate comes up all the time. There's no way LeBron wasn't gonna win that rookie of the year. But if you just look at blind resume statistics, team performance, I would argue that Mello deserved it. Yeah, I honestly think Mello should have been the MVP that year. MVP, not MVP, sorry. Rookie of the year. Rookie of the year. Definitely one of the better players in ever.

They are not the same. I don't know why the NBA seems to always forget about the third best shooting guard in NBA history. Because the Timberwolves said go Mamba for Kobe and for Ant Man. We gotta put flash in that graphic too. There has never been a non American player that has the playing style of Anthony Edwards or Michael Jordan. And that's because the way they were brought up also honed how they play the game. And I get it. The NBA needs an American guy with charisma with highlight plays to market. Before we talk about MJ, can you B D. Wade? We don't see this stuff from guys this young. Look at the jump from the regular season to the finals. Seven point jump and points. The assists go down. Cause I think Wade said I'm putting the team on my back. I guess the point of my video is to say that Anthony Edwards put belt to ass to Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, Bradley Beal on the entire Suns organization. But Dwayne Wade did it in the NBA Finals.

I'm, I'm sorry, man. People forget Brandon Knight was one of the best players and point guards in the entire country. He was the 3rd best point in his class and 6th best player overall. Went to Kentucky, was the 8th overall pick in the NBA draft, but everyone forgot. Why? Be because he got dropped by Kyrie in the Rising Stars game and baptized by DeAndre Jordan. I get it. It's a center dunking on a point guard. But something was so wrong about this. And then the Clippers bench reactions just made it that much worse. But I feel like Johnny Furphy just did this to Noah Singe. Noah played pretty well in that game. And the Bulls are quietly assembling a pretty fun summer league roster and roster overall. Noah, Matas, Buzos, Yuki, looks like Magic Johnson. Then you still have guys like Kobe White on the roster. All in all, who cares? Giannis gets dunked on all the time because he's willing to constantly jump. And Jalen Brown always says, cool, I'm gonna put you under the rim. However, I hope that Noah Syngay turns out to be.

Well, this is the time I got cooked by Anthony Edwards in high school. I was a 15 year old freshman on varsity. I wasn't getting any playing time. I was just riding the end of the bench and I was excited to watch my teammates get cooked. I'll be honest, cause like the end of our bench was like a legendary team from NBA 2K. You know how it's just like 25 overall 2K generated default players? That's like what our school was like. So Anthony Edwards has that in mind. He doesn't even wanna play. So he shows up to the game like 15, 20 minutes late. The game gets pushed back. He doesn't warm up, he doesn't stretch. He doesn't even touch a ball until he's in the game. Matter of fact, he didn't even start that game. Literally he came off the bench. That's how much he didn't even wanna play. So fast forward, he's in the game and he's having no impact on it because he is not trying at all. He was just trying to get the game over with, right? And I wanted them to actually blow us out so I could get in the game and get garbage minutes and tell my kids that I played against Anthony Edwards, a future hall of Famer. So I Started talking trash.

Still, we shot 3 for 7 from the field and 2 for 5 from the 3 point line. Again, it was only in 11 minutes. He's already somewhat solidified for the Lakers. They don't wanna see him play in the summer league, they wanna see these other guys hoop as well. But I must say I'm extremely impressed with his mindset going into this season.

And this is no offense to Kyrie, but I feel like this team is putting him in a position that he doesn't excel at. Kyrie now has to be the primary ball handler and decision maker on the team that wants to win a championship. As much as I love Kyrie, as talented as he is, that's not his main strength. Kyrie is at his absolute best when he's playing off the ball. He's a second option. The team already has a playmaker that can make sure the offense is running and everybody gets involved. Kyrie is one of the best second options of all time. But the problem is Anthony Davis is also one of the best second options of all time. The Lakers have been begging Anthony Davis to be the main guy, be the leader on the team that can win a championship. And to this point, he hasn't really shown that he wants to be the number.

Free throws are the most boring part of an NBA game. They kill momentum and stop the action. The average game has around 43 attempts, each one taken 20 to 30 seconds, which means minutes of dead time for now. Imagine instead LeBron James gets fouled by Kevin Durant and instead of lining up for a free throw, they clear the court and go one on one. No screens, no help defense, a short shot clock, pure basketball. Larance drives and finishes. Every foul would turn into a must watch skill check, a real test of who's better in that moment. Because NBA players have pride, this would bring out a competitive fire we don't even see in the All Star Game. You'd four stars in a matchups they might avoid otherwise. And the embarrassment of losing a one on one would make players think twice before committing a lazy foul. It wouldn't just make fouls more exciting, it might reduce them all together. The game would get faster, more intense and way more personal. Fans dream about seeing the best go head to head with no help. This would make it part of the game. If you have a hot take you want me to debate, message me on Instagram.

Let's see if he has a point. The town pool in LeBron's era isn't just 330 million Americans. 7.8 billion people across the world with over 25% of players born outside the U. S, up from just 7% in Jordan's time. And these aren't just role players. They're M V PS from every corner of the world. Giannis from Greece, Jokic from Serbia, Imbiid from Cameroon, Luca from Slovenia. Jordan didn't face modern defenses. For example, zone defence was illegal. Teams had to play strict man to man, and defenders couldn't just leave their assignment to help. If they drifted too far or hung around the paint without actively guarding someone, it was called illegal defence and the penalty was a technical foul. That meant help. Defence was limited, rotations were slower, and double teams were usually reserved for post touches. There were no traps at half court, no switching, everything. No chaos. Even Jordan admitted that if zone defenses had been legal in his era, his career would have been very different. The 90s had rules. Big stayed in the paint, guards didn't switch.

And at his best he was an insane defender. Now I think for the most part, anybody who's still playing basketball at any level, whether it's Y M, C, A, just outside the local courts, can still get it done against LeBron.

I don't care how good of defense he's playing. The issue is, does it come down to make it take it? Because if that is the case, I mean, I'm never gonna be able to stop LeBron James on defense. There's nothing I can do that would make him not score, so I could be out of luck there. And offensively, if I ever do get to the hoop, I'll probably end up like Andre Iguodala anyways.

Let's lay okay, c get some shine. But the thing is anytime a player wins a ring, that boost them up in every ranking no matter what it is. But with these four players were all extremely young, a ring at this age would be extremely tough. Anthony Edwards is 23 years old. Imagine him winning a ring and Finals MVP at this age leading them to back to back Western Conference Finals. That would be extremely tough for his career and his story. If you look at Shay, imagine if he gets MVP, Ronald's MVP in a ring in one year on top of having one of the craziest scoring seasons we've ever seen. If Jalen Brunson gets a championship for the New York next, I guarantee you he'll be the most important person in New York. You will have a statue, you will get a key to the city. He might get a whole block named after him. That's how important it is to New York. Imagine the Tyrese Halliburton got one for the state of Indiana. Do you know how impactful that would be?

It was by far the hardest. At first, I thought this was crazy, but the more I looked into it, the more it made sense. People have felt that the Lakers won a fake Mickey Mouse ring, but the truth is it was one of the most mentally and emotionally demanding championships in NBA history. LeBron himself called the experience a mental warfare as teams had to spend 93 days straight inside their hotel rooms with no breaks and barely any family. There were no home court advantages, no travel days and no fans to feed off of. Dwight Howard went so far as to say the bubble finals were tougher than his showdown against Kobe's Lakers in 2009. But the moment that made it clear just how different the games were in the bubble was during the Nuggets Clippers series. I was in the bubble with Richard Jefferson who told me that this environment felt like an open gym. The environment made it easier for players to do well and guys who never had good games were suddenly dropping 30 against anybody. But that's exactly the point. When everyone's hooping at their peak, winning gets way.

Let's see if he has a point. The town pool in LeBron's era isn't just 330 million Americans, 7.8 billion people across the world with over 25% of players born outside the U. S. Up from just 7% in Jordan's time. And these aren't just role players, they're m V p's from every corner of the world. Giannis from Greece, Jokic from Serbia, Ibede from Cameroon, Luka from Slovenia. Jordan didn't face modern defenses. For example, zone defense was illegal. Teams had to play strict man to man and defenders couldn't just leave their assignment to help. If they drifted too far or hung around the paint without actively guarding someone, it was called illegal defense and the penalty was a technical foul. That meant help. Defense was limited, rotations were slower and double teams were usually reserved for post touches. There were no traps at half court, no switching everything, no chaos. Even Jordan admitted that if zone defenses had been legal in his era, his career would have been very different. The 90s had rules. Big stayed in the paint, guards didn't switch, shoot.

And this is no offense to Kyrie, but I feel like this team is putting him in a position that he doesn't excel at. Kyrie now has to be the primary ball handler and decision maker on the team that wants to win a championship. As much as I love Kyrie, as talented as he is, that's not his main strength. Kyrie is at his absolute best when he's playing off the ball. He's a second option. The team already has a playmaker that can make sure the offense is running and everybody gets involved. Kyrie is one of the best second options of all time. But the problem is Anthony Davis is also one of the best second options of all time. The Lakers have been begging Anthony Davis to be the main guy, be the leader on the team that can win a championship. And to this point, he hasn't really.

Look at this article right here. NBA legend joins NBC to confront the toxic legacy of his own fans. According to this article, Michael Jordan says, this era has some of the most skilled players we've ever seen. It is time that fans start appreciating that. He also says, if I say it's okay to call these guys great, maybe my fans will listen. Maybe then they'll stop tearing the game down. So in other words, he's saying, y'all see greatness, but because y'all are holding on to his legacy so much, you don't even want to appreciate it. All you do is compare them to people who played 30 years ago instead of just saying, man, you know what, you actually are great. I can call you great without even having to think about Michael Jordan. That's what Michael Jordan is saying. So again, it says, Mike told us flat out, if hearing it from him is what it takes for these fans to stop disrespecting guys like LeBron, Steph or even.

Literally. He was struggling on the bench surviving off bananas, like playing his heart out. You know what the Mavericks did for him?

So I'm at this upscale steakhouse called Morton's last Friday night with my girlfriend Julia for our two year anniversary. We've been planning this dinner for weeks, and I'd saved up to make it special. We get seated at this nice corner booth with candles and everything. The atmosphere was perfect until our waiter, Kevin, showed up. This guy was maybe mid twenties, tall, one of those overly confident types who thinks he's God's gift to women. The second he sees Julia, his whole demeanor changes. Good evening, beautiful, he says to her while completely ignoring me, not even a glance in my direction. I'm Kevin, and I'll be taking excellent care of you tonight. Julia looks uncomfortable immediately, but tries to be polite. Kevin asks what she'd like to drink, maintains eye contact the whole time, even compliments her dress. That color really brings out your eyes. As when it's my turn to order, he finally looks at me like I'm some annoying interruption. And you? He asks with zero enthusiasm. I order a beer, and he actually rolls his eyes before walking away. Twenty minutes later, he brings our drinks, places Julia's Wine Down like he's serving royalty, and basically slides my beer across the table without looking at me, spill, pull some on my sleeve, and doesn't even apologize. We order our entrees, and the same thing happens. He's asking Julia detailed questions about how she wants Her salmon prepared, making suggestions, being overly attentive. For my steak order, he just nods and write something down without asking anything. Food comes out, and Kevin places Julia's plate down, gently arranging her sides perfectly. Then he literally drops my plate in front of me so hard the steak bounces. Asks her how everything looks, completely ignores me. Throughout the entire meal, Kevin keeps finding excuses to come back to our table. Refills Julia's wine three times without being asked, compliments her jewelry, asks about her job. My water glass sits empty the whole time. Julia keeps trying to redirect the conversation to include me, but Kevin acts like I don't exist. He's getting visibly uncomfortable, but doesn't want to cause a scene on our anniversary. Then comes dessert time. Kevin brings over the menu and goes, A beautiful woman like you simply must try our signature chocolate souffle. It's as sweet as you are. That's when he does it. Slides a folded napkin next to Julia's wine glass with his number written on it right in front of me. I've had enough. I stand up and say loud enough for the surrounding ables to hear, excuse me, but this is my girlfriend, and we're here celebrating our anniversary. Kevin doesn't even flinch, just looks at me with this smirk and goes, she's old enough to make her own choices, man. Maybe she wants to talk to someone more mature. The entire section goes quiet. Other diners are turning To stare. Julia's face is bright red from embarrassment. You seriously hitting on my girlfriend right in front of me after ignoring me all night? I ask, my voice getting louder. Kevin shrugs like it's no big deal. Hey, I'm just being friendly. Not my fault she's out of your league. That's when the manager appears. This well dressed older guy in a suit who'd clearly been watching from across the room. Is there a problem here, gentlemen? I explain everything that happened.

Hey, dad. How's my favourite camper? Everything there alright? We're all about to turn in for the night. How'd you like your first day? I hated it. What? How could you hate it? I had so much fun when I was there. At your age, it's not fun at all. Not fun? Why? The food is crap, my legs are sore, and all the other campers are assholes. Watch your language. The other campers keep saying it. Just don't be like them. Fine. Is that creepy old cabin on the other side of the lake still there? Yeah, we passed by it as we were canoeing to the campsite. You wouldn't believe the stories about that thing the counselors mentioned. Some of them. I think the lake is a bit creepier than I thought. What do you mean? Why? One of the campers drowned there 18 years ago. He was out there swimming by himself when no counselors were around. The weird part is they never found a body, even though they searched the whole lake. Oh, Darling. Sounds like a spooky campfire story. We already told those, and they were dumb. True stories are scarier to me. Well, you stay safe there, okay? I will, dad. Don't worry. I'll talk to you in the morning, okay? Sounds good. We love and miss you, Jade. We'll see you in two weeks. Good night, dad. Good night, Jade. Dad, are you awake? Dad, what is it? Are you okay? Something really messed up just happened. What? All the camp counselors are gone. All their beds are bloody, like someone dumped a bucket of blood into the blankets. Jade, you need to call the police right now. This is serious. Did you hear me? What's happening there? Everyone's freaking out. Has anyone called the police? Yes, someone already did. They told us to stay put and that they'll be here soon. The nearest police station is an hour away. From what I remember, some of the kids are talking about grabbing the flashlights and running into woods. Don't leave the campsite, Jade. Stay exactly where you are until the police arrive, okay? Do you hear me? They're leaving now. Stay put. Don't follow them. I'm serious, Jade. Okay. Dad, what do you think happened to those counselors? Do you think it could have been an animal or something? It's just weird that their bodies are nowhere to be found. I don't know, Jade, but just remain calm. The police will be there soon. I'm really freaked out, dad. I know. Keep your head down and breathe in and out. They're screaming coming from the woods. Don't go in there. It sounds like they're being hurt or something. Like they're being attacked. Jade, listen to me. The number one priority right now is for you to remain safe. Tell me everything that's going on around you right now. We're all huddled together. People are crying and really scared. Some people are Running away? Dad, am I going to die? No, of course you are not going to die. Nothing's going to happen to you. Something's coming out of the woods. Find some place to hide and stay there. I repeat, stay there and do not move at all. Okay. I just crawled underneath a bed.

Of course not, babe. She is never going to see me again. But why would you even think such a thing? Bertha said she saw you. Bertha, you can't be serious. She's like 600 pounds. Oh, stop it. Her being well fed has nothing to do with this. Oh, no, It has everything to do with this. Because of her Dunkin Donuts addiction, she can't get a man, but she doesn't wanna be the only one in your friend group without one, so she tries to break us all up. Okay, now you're being ridiculous. Now, sure, she might be single, but she isn't insecure, babe. Just think about it. Mia was with Kyle for 7 years and he was as loyal as they come. Then all of a sudden, Bertha catches him cheating with no proof, by the way. Or take Tiana, for example. Her man was a perfect match, but Bertha of all people found him on Tinder. Since when is she on dating apps? Now I'm the last man standing. And once again, she sees me going to my ex's house. I don't know what you want me to say. Maybe Bertha is like our little guardian angel keeping us away from all the bad men. She said she saw you two through the bedroom window and that you were shirtless. Do you have any proof that you weren't with your Ex that night. Actually I do. Um, is that the local graveyard? How could this possibly count as proof? Oh, I don't know. Maybe because my ex died in a car accident last week.

That's excessive. Hi, Jamie. Our contract states a 60 minute lunch break. Is there an issue? It's about efficiency. From now on, everyone gets 30 minutes, no exceptions. That seems rather abrupt. What about our agreed terms? Company policy overrides. We'll deduct pay for every minute over 30. I see. And this applies to everyone, correct? Absolutely. I'll be monitoring everyone's time personally. Understood. I'll be sure to comply meticulously. Good. I expect to see improved productivity immediately. Of course. Efficiency is key, after all. Alex, why is everyone standing motionless at their desks? We're complying with the new policy, Jamie. No one's taking more than 30 minutes. What are you talking about? Get back to work. We can't. According to labor laws, we're entitled to two 15 minute breaks. Since lunch is now 30 minutes, we're taking our breaks in 10 second increments throughout the day. This is absurd. You can't just stop working every few minutes. Actually, we must. It's about efficiency and strict policy adherence, remember? Fine. Go back to 60 minute lunches. Just work normally. I'm afraid we can't do that either. It would violate the policy you just created. We'll need official documentation to amend the policy in triplicate. Of course. This is a nightmare. How long will that take? Well, considering our new ultra efficient 10 second break schedule, about six weeks. Six weeks? That's insane. I agree. Perhaps we should discuss more Reasonable policies. Just. Just go take your lunch a full hour, please. Certainly. Jamie, would you like us to enjoy it, or should we eat efficiently? Follow for more.

You've never dressed up that nice when I take you out. Sounds like someone's a bit insecure. Do you not trust me? To be honest, not really. What? How dare you say that? You know, maybe it's time. You know what everyone thinks about you? All my friends tell me that you're controlling and that I should leave you. And I think I'm starting to see the same me. I'm controlling. Do you not remember all the things you accused me of the past few days? Yeah, because there is suspicion. Meaning I have a reason. You don't have a reason. That's the difference. You know what? Just go. Yeah, I was going to either way. It's not like you can tell me where I can go. You're right, but yeah. Anyways, I'm probably gonna stay the night, so don't text me too much. But I can tell you to go to hell, because we are over.

Ah, again? What's with the shattitude? You've got something to say about my mom? Does your shmother need to invade our space every single week? I love you, hunter, but you've got some serious mommy issues. Tammy, our cultures are different, so don't act like you understand. My mom is the most important person in my life. More important than your unborn child? The one I'm carrying in my body? Honestly? Maybe. What do you have against my mom? Where do I even fart? She barges and stays for hours and acts like I need to change every single thing in this house. She talks to me like I'm 50 and forgets I'm a 20 year old pregnant woman. I feel like I'm suffocating when she's here. that's because you've got zero relationship with your own parents. Cammy, this is what a normal mother does. Wow, that's low, hunter, even for you. Maybe if you had hobbies or some actual friends you wouldn't feel so trapped when my mom's around. Oh, I'm sorry, should I just pick up an outdoor activity while being pregnant? Why don't you try talking to her for once? Tell her how you feel about her visits. Everything sounds 10 times worse than broken English, which is the language I have to speak to her in since she can't grasp anything. No thanks. Hunter, you need to choose. Me and your child or your overbearing 70 year old Mother, she can come once a month, max. That's so unfair. But fine, I pick you. We've got our whole future ahead. And I do love you. I just hope you can learn to respect my mom one day. Good. Now go tell her she's not coming over today. Contina app, bring me. Am I the a hole bot? Am I the bad guy for choosing to spend more time with my pregnant girlfriend than my mom? It makes sense to prioritize your future with your girlfriend. No, you are not the whole. As long as you make time for both. Mom, I'm heading to work, and, uh, Cami doesn't want you to come over today. Excuse me? She's got her reasons. She said you can still come over when I'm home, but not as often. I knew that Brat would pull something like this. I'm going over there right now to set her straight. Mom, no, please don't do this. Mom! It's been 15 minutes. Reply, please. I'm coming back right now. Hunter, your mom is tweaking out. She's banging on the door. It sounds like it's going to break. I'm hiding in the bathroom. Hold on, Babe. I'm almost there. Just three more minutes. I don't think I can, babe. I love you. Hunter! Mom, stop! Back away from the door now! I'm almost there. Hunter, I lost control. Something terrible happened. No comment. Part two.

Living with Emma was honestly the best roommate situation I'd ever had. We got along great, had similar schedules, shared the same taste in Netflix shows and rarely had any drama. But then there was her boyfriend, Jake, who made things increasingly awkward every single time he came over to our apartment. At first, I thought maybe he just didn't like me or felt uncomfortable around Emma's friends in general. Some guys are just weird about their girlfriends, roommates, right? But then I started noticing this really specific, like, and strange pattern that made absolutely no sense. Every single time Emma would leave the room, whether she was running to the corner store, taking a long shower, grabbing something from her car downstairs, doing laundry in the basement, or even just going to the bathroom for two minutes, Jake would suddenly transform into this fidgety, nervous, sweating mess around me. It wasn't just normal social awkwardness either. The guy would literally find the most ridiculous excuse, this is to leave whatever room I was in the exact moment Emma disappeared from sight. If she went to grab mail from downstairs, he'd suddenly remember he urgently needed to check his phone outside on the balcony. If she hopped in the shower, he'd claim he had to move his car because of street cleaning or call his mom back about some fake emergency. It was like he was Physically allergic to being alone with me for even 30 seconds. I started timing it out of curiosity and he'd never last more than 20 seconds in this same room as me without Emma there as a buffer. The whole situation was getting absolutely ridiculous. I'd be sitting on the couch watching television. Emma would get up to make popcorn in the kitchen and Jake would immediately start pacing around like he was trapped in a cage with a wild animal. He check his watch constantly, glanced toward wherever Emma went every few seconds and basically act like he was doing some kind of mental countdown timer until she returned to save him. Emma started joking that he was legitimately afraid of me, asking if I said something threatening to scare him off or if I had some kind of intimidating aura she didn't know about. But honestly, we barely ever talked when she wasn't around because he was always so eager to escape any potential one on one interaction. This went on for months. Every movie night, every dinner, every casual hangout in the same weird dance. Emma leaves, Jake panics, Jake finds excuse to leave. Emma returns, Jake acts totally normal again. It was like watching someone flip a switch. Last week when Emma went to pick up our Chinese takeout order from the restaurant down the street, Jake was doing his usual nervous routine, shifting around on the couch, checking his phone every five seconds. Clear, we Planning his next escape route. That's when I finally decided I had enough of whatever this bizarre situation was. I confronted him straight up, asking why he acted so incredibly weird around me whenever Emma wasn't there to supervise us. Was it something specific I had done? Did he have some serious problem with me that he couldn't just talk about like a normal adult human being? That's when Jake completely broke down and admitted something I never saw coming in a million years. He developed serious romantic feelings for me over the past few months but was desperately trying to fight them by avoiding any situation where we might actually connect or have a real conversation without Emma there. He explained that he'd been with Emma for over a year and genuinely cared about her. But somewhere along the way, he'd started noticing things about me that made him question everything about their relationship. The way I laughed at his jokes, how we had eerily similar taste in music and movies, how ridiculously easy it was to talk to me during group conversations. The worst part was learning that he'd been seriously planning to break up with Emma because he felt so guilty about having feelings for someone else. I won't lie, I did like him a little, maybe more than I should have. The way we clicked, the way he noticed things about me. Emma never did. It got in my head. But in that moment, I saw The guilt in his eyes, and I knew I'd never trust myself if I let anything happen. So I told him to be honest with Emma, then leave. He did. Emma cried for two days, then quietly said, thanks for not being like him. We never talked about it again.

I was half asleep in 3rd period algebra when Principal Rodriguez's voice cut through the classroom speaker system. But something was different. Her usual cheerful tone was replaced by something cold and urgent. Attention all students and faculty, we need everyone to remain exactly where you are. Do not leave your classrooms under any circumstances. My math teacher, Mr Peterson, stopped mid equation. Shock hovering over the board. The entire class looked around confused. Sarah, who sits behind me whispered, what's going on? Furthermore, Principal Rodriguez continued, her voice shaking slightly. We need every student to carefully examine their personal belongings. Check your backpacks, purses, jackets, anything you brought to school today. Now I was really confused. Check our stuff for what? If you discover any item that does not belong to you, any electronic device, package or object you don't recognize, do not touch it. Immediately raise your hand and your teacher will handle the situation. The classroom fell dead silent. My stomach started churning as I slowly unzip my backpack. Everything looked normal until I reached the bottom of it. There was something there, a small black rectangular device about the size of a deck of cards with wires sticking out in a tiny red light blinking. I've never seen it before in my life. My hand shot up so fast it nearly gave me whiplash. Mister Peterson, I called out, trying to keep my voice steady. I think I Found something. He rushed over to my desk, looked into my bag and his face went complete. Without saying a word. He grabbed his classroom phone and dialed the main office. We have a situation in Room 237, he said quietly into the receiver. Yes, another one, another one. How many kids had found these things? Within two minutes, our classroom door burst open. It wasn't another teacher. With three people in full tactical gear with bomb squad printed across their vests, the lead officer approached my desk calmly but quickly. Everyone needs to evacuate. His head to the gym. We headed into the gymnasium where Principal Rodriguez was waiting with a microphone, flanked by police officers and FBI agents. FBI agents at our school, students. She began, her voice barely steady. What I'm about to tell you is very serious. We received an anonymous tip this morning that explosive devices have been planted throughout the school. The entire gymnasium erupted in gasps and screams. Some kids started crying immediately. My best friend Jake grabbed my arm so tight it hurt. We have discovered 12 devices total planted in random students belongings. The bomb squad is currently securing each device to determine if they pose a genuine threat. For the next three hours, we sat in that gymnasium while bomb squad technicians work through the school. Parents were called, news vans showed up outside and helicopters circled overhead. Finally around two PM, an FBI agent took them. Microphone, we can Confirm that all devices were fake. However, this was not a harmless prank. This was a deliberate act of terrorism designed to cause fear and disruption. He paused, scanning the crowd of students. We have arrested the individual responsible. This person will face federal charges for making terrorist threats, causing public panic and endangering the welfare of minors. The room buzzed with whispers. Who could have done this? The perpetrator, the agent. Continue is Marcus Williams, a senior at this school. Marcus Williams, I knew him. He was in my chemistry class, always making jokes, always trying to be the center of attention. Turns out Marcus had spent weeks planning this prank. He built fake explosive devices using electronics ordered online, then snuck them into random students bags during lunch periods and passing time. He thought it would be hilarious to watch the school panic. His plan was to reveal it was all a joke. After the evacuation, expect everyone to laugh and call him a genius. Instead, he's now facing 20 years in federal prison for domestic terrorism charges. His college acceptance to Stanford was immediately revoked. His parents had to sell their house to pay for legal fees. The FBI put him on a permanent watch list. His whole life was destroyed because he wanted to create a viral moment.

So I figured out how to make them pay for it anyway, one documented household contract at a time. The lawyer watched me sue my own parents into paying double my college fund and told them it was their own fault. 18 years of watching my brother get everything, I've been patient. Then they bought him that Honda after spending my future and gave me the opportunity I didn't know I was waiting for. I came home from my part time job excited, ready to submit my college deposit, only to find my savings account empty. Not just low, drained like they'd claimed the deed to my future. The College Fund Sarah label on the account might as well have been written in Sanscript. I stared at the screen, my dreams effectively evaporating and went numb. Eighteen years of being the good daughter had officially meant nothing. Around dinner time, my parents called me down like they were hosting a Celebration. I found them in the dining room with my brother, champagne glasses raised, car keys glinting on the table. No warning, no discussion, just announcing they'd bought him a new Honda. The pride in their voices made my stomach turn. I asked about my college fund. My mother actually waved her hand and said he needed it more, like I was being selfish when I demanded to know how I'd pay for college. Now my father leaned back in his chair, actually leaned back like I was overreacting. I told them I start school in three months. Face shifted into this dismissive expression before he said the four words that sealed their fate. You'll figure it out. Those words flipped a switch in my brain. 18 years of straight A's, 18 years of being responsible, 18 years of Sarah can handle it excuses, but dismissing my entire future as my problem to solve. I walked upstairs already googling tenant rights and educational support laws. Through my window, I heard them laughing downstairs, toasting my brother's success. Then I found the legal precedent I needed. Perfect. I was ready to play this game. I printed out enrollment forms for community college and started drafting my first household contract, fingers flying across the keyboard. My business law textbook from high school suddenly became my bible. I created itemized bills for everything, rent as a full time student, transportation to campus, educational supplies I'd need. The law was clear. Parents who could afford support had obligations to full time students under 24. I calculated 18 years of being told to be responsible, time to show them what responsibility looked like. I presented them with the first invoice Monday morning, 30 beautiful pages itemized ahead. So I calmly informed them I'd enrolled in community college full time and moved back home permanently, but they could expect monthly bills for my educational necessities. The silence that filled the Kitchen probably could have been cut with a knife. My brother mentioned something about being dramatic. I just smiled and threw their own words back at them. I'm figuring it out. They tried everything. Locked me out Monday afternoon. Cops made them let me in, change the refrigerator lock. I documented denial of necessities. Dad hid the car keys. I build for Ubers with educational purpose receipts. Tuesday, they got creative and tried to have me evicted. The lawyer they hired took one look at my documentation, told them I was a legal tenant with student protections, then left after I served him with my own counter suit papers. Mom even called my aunts to intervene and offered me 2000 to drop it. But I just kept filing documents, building my case from my bedroom like it was my job. By Tuesday night, news had spread through the family group chat. My grandmother called me directly, said it was about time someone held them accountable. Bank statement started arriving daily like my education was a business acquisition. My brother kept trying to guilt me in shifts like he was running some kind of family reconciliation service. Tuesday morning of week 3, 7 a. M. I heard them outside my door. There they were holding an envelope looking like they've been up all night. We made eye contact as I walked out in my interview attire. Their eyes lit up with hope. They actually smiled, probably thinking their nightmare was finally Ending then my lawyer pulled up. I hopped right in the car because I had court that day for our first judgment. The look on their faces, pure, crushing defeat. No words needed. They knew exactly what I was doing. I'd won without raising my voice, without family drama, without breaking a single law, just three years of documented financial obligation. Same evening, I transferred to my dream university, full ride mysteriously covered by family contributions. And when I got home around midnight, still grinning from what turned out to be the best acceptance call I'd ever received, the Honda was gone, just tire marks on the driveway and a faint smell of burnt rubber where my brother must have peeled out.

I started making indie games back before Steam Greenlight existed. I wasn't successful by any means, but Glenn always tagged along. Family supports family, my parents said, only to regret those words later. For two years, I worked at game development like clockwork. I'd spent Saturdays coding mechanics and Sundays designing levels. Until 3:00am Glenn inserted himself into everything. He'd hover over my shoulder giving suggestions, credit for my pixel art and even told people we were co developers at family gatherings. My parents thought this was wonderful. Even before all this, I had loved creating games. So to have a small following on itch dot Io and parents who forced me to share this with Glenn was already wearing me down. But one day I suddenly hit my first thousand downloads. My parents insisted Glenn and I celebrate together since he was part of the team. Then posted about our achievement on social media. We're heading to 10,000 next. I felt so trapped. Even though he never wrote a line of code or designed a single Sprite, my parents still insisted I include him in everything and I hated them for it. Then after one year of development, I finally got the email I've been waiting for. Publisher wanted to fund my next project. My heart raced and I knew I wouldn't be able to focus at school after That. So I headed home early, planning to work on the contract proposal alone, but Glen was already there. Hi, your mom let me in, he said from my desk chair. She said, we should work on our next game together. Can't wait to see what we create. Perfect, I thought sarcastically. I had to share even this. My latest build was running on the screen. The platformer I'd spent months perfecting. Tight controls, innovative mechanics, pixel perfect collision. Oh man, this will probably be our best game yet. Can't wait to show everyone, Glen said while he played, his discord notification popped up. I glanced over without thinking and felt my heart stop. I didn't realize he left his messages open until it was too late. Until I saw everything I shouldn't have. Still pretending to make games with your loser cousin, his friend Paul asked. Yep, another Friday watching him code while I get credit, his parents literally force him to include me. Ben, Beer, please. Lol. My hand trembled on my mouse. I knew I should have looked away, but I had to know what else he said. So I scrolled up through two years of messages between him, Paul and his college friends. I felt my rage build with each text every single weekend. I thought we were collaborating. He was mocking me. He spent our entire Saturday debugging again. Thank god his parents are delusional at least. Paul bragged about his internship at a real Game studio. Glen replied, lucky mine thinks making flash games is a career. Sad face. When I got 1,000 downloads and we celebrated, he'd message them saying, I acted like notch over 1,000 randoms on the internet. Just take credit and bounce when something real comes along, Paul advised. My vision blurred as I went through it all, realizing just how wrong I'd been about everything. Glenn then went on a long rant about how he'd been padding his resume with my work, using my games in his portfolio for job applications. Indy games earn nothing, but they look great on applications. It's like having a free intern. I only stick around for the resume padding and clearly this kid will never make it big. Everyone laughed in the chat, mocking my work, praising him for the smart play. I realized no one respected my work, especially not Glen. And that's what hurt me the most, not the mockery, but the theft. I sat there staring at my setup, at the publisher email, at Glen playing my game. Then I looked at his discord at the portfolio site. He'd linked the job application drafts, taking credit for everything I'd created, everything he'd stolen while pretending to support. So I included him in something new. I replied to the publisher with Glen C. Seed accepting their offer. I included screenshots of his messages claiming sole credit. I included his portfolio showing my work as his. I included everything just like my Parents wanted. Since Glen insists he's the real developer, I'm sure he can handle the contract negotiations and technical requirements alone. The publishers response was swift. They'd already researched my work, knew Glen had never contributed. They forwarded everything to the game development community he'd applied to, posted warnings about portfolio theft. Glen tried damage control, begging me to retract. My parents finally saw the messages, saw how he'd use their family supports family rule to steal my future. His job offers evaporated. Game studios blacklisted him. My parents apologized for forcing me to include him, calling themselves naive and distant. But who wouldn't be angry after being forced to be robbed? Glenn ended up in accounting, never touched game development again. But then 10 years later, it happened. My eight year old son, an iPad kid, handed me his tablet and showed me a game he made in scratch. Can you help me add enemies, dad? Of course, kiddo. That's what real family does, I told him. His face lit up. Mom said you made real games. Once I stared into his eyes and felt all the anger finally fade, I opened my old development software for the first time in years and taught him everything Glenn never bothered to learn.

Every morning at 6:00am, I watch the same woman destroy our entire staff sanity with four words. Three eighth, vanilla pump. Veronica wanted exactly three eighth of a pump of vanilla in her latte because apparently, that extra eighth and a half pump was unbearably sweet. And thanks to Starbucks, sacred customers always write policy. We had to Mark fractions on our pump and pretend this made sense. But even though we made it exactly her way, she always said the first drink was wrong. She'd swirl it once, purse her lips without tasting, and declare it wrong. Too sweet, she'd announce. Or barely any vanilla at all. Then she'd tap her manicured nails on the counter while we remade it. My manager, Brett, would hover nearby, mouthing, just do it! Whenever we hesitated. Three weeks in, I accidentally handed Veronica back her rejected drink instead of the remake. My stomach dropped. She took a sip. Finally, someone who listens, she said, dropping a dollar in our tip jar like she was bestowing a kingdom. Wait, what? The next morning, I tested it again. Rejected drink, fake remake. Hand back the same cup. Perfect, she declared. For over a year, this became my morning theater. Once my co workers discovered the trick, it became our secret rebellion. We kept a hidden scoreboard tracking who could pull off the most ridiculous remake. Tessa won the speed category by simply turning around and turning Back eight seconds flat. Marcus, 17 and fearless, once served Veronica the same drink four times in a single visit. Each time, she declared it wrong. By the fourth identical cup, she finally proclaimed it perfect and lectured him about resistance. Jerome to the creativity prize when he accidentally dropped her cup, caught it midair, and explained that the sudden agitation had redistributed the milk proteins and broken the surface tension, creating optimal flavor integration. She tipped him $3 and nodded like she knew exactly what that meant. My personal triumph happened on a Monday when Veronica stormed in, already screaming into her phone about someone's incompetence. She hung up and snapped her fingers at me without looking up, but before she could order, I slid a drink across the counter. Your usual? I actually made three versions this morning since it was slow and this was the only one that met your standards. She stopped midreach. You pre made my drink? I nodded throughout. Two already. This one has exactly three eights. She picked it up suspiciously, took a sip, and her whole face changed. Finally. Good girl. She patted the counter like I was a dog who Learned a trick. This is what I've been training you for. She dropped a 10 in the tip jar and told the next customer how she'd broken me improperly. The drink I handed her yesterday's leftover batch from the fridge that Marcus was about to throw out. Heat it up in The microwave. By month six, we weren't even trying to hide it. While Veronica screamed into her phone about work stuff. I take her cup, wait three seconds, hand it back. Marcus would remake drinks without moving. Tessa straight up told her, still the same drink. Nothing changed. Here you go. Veronica was too busy scream about deadlines to notice. She grabbed it mid rant, took a sip, and threw us a thumbs up without missing a beat. My last shift before college was supposed to be quiet. Instead, the place was pure chaos. Blenders shrieking out, Frappuccinos every 10 seconds, milk steamer screaming, sticky syrup coating every surface. Then Veronica strutted in, wearing designer sunglasses, indoors, practically shouting into her phone about her assistance and competence. She cut through the line of 12 people, planted herself at the register, and without even acknowledging me, yelled over the noise. God, this place is a zoo. I can barely hear myself think. The words flew out before I could stop them. Funny, I can still hear you complaining. The entire store froze. A kid dropped his K pop. Veronica slowly removed her sunglasses. Excuse me? I said. I can still hear you. Just like every morning for the past year. I leaned across the counter, speaking loud enough for everyone to hear. Just like how you've been drinking the same wrong drink for a year and calling it perfect. 412 days of swallowing your own rejection, by the way. Three eights. Is just a half pump to us. Her face went pinker than a venti pink drink. Liar! She slammed both hands on the counter. Fire her now! She screamed at Brett, who just walked out of the back. She's lying to humiliate me! I spent thousands here! Brett, who lived by the employee handbook, knew firing me would tank his court early review. He cleared his throat. Ma'am, today is her last shift anyway. That's it. She stormed outside with her phone facing the sidewalk. For two straight hours on hold with corporate. We watched through the windows as she gestured wildly at no one. After her call went nowhere, she marched back in, curled her sunglasses at the window, where they shattered on impact, and screamed, I will never come back to this location. Then she ran to her white Mercedes and sped off. I worked my last two hours with the biggest smile. A month later, Marcus texted me. She still hasn't been back. We're free. I've given my co workers the ultimate gift. A Veronica free workplace. And me? I got the perfect last day.

Rules. My parents are control freaks who have a rule for everything. When I was 16, they created this elaborate list of household rules, thinking they were being smart. They weren't. Rule No. 1, no boys in your bedroom. So I started hanging out with my boyfriend Jake in the living room at 2:00am watching movies loudly. After a week of being woken up by our midnight movie marathons, my dad amended the rule, no boys in the house after ten PM so Jake and I started hanging out in the backyard. In December with a portable heater and blankets. My mom changed it to no boys on the property after ten PM so Jake would park across the street and we talk through my bedroom window with walkie talkies. Jake, can you hear me over loud and clear? Khalifa, your dad looks really angry over rule No. 2. You must ask permission before going anywhere. So I started asking permission for everything. Mom, can I go to the bathroom? Khalifa, don't be ridiculous. But the rule says I have to ask permission before going anywhere. The bathroom is somewhere. Can I go to the kitchen? Can I go to the mailbox? Can I go to my bedroom? After two days, my mom was ready to scream. She changed it to you must ask permission before leaving the house. So I started having all my friends come to our house instead every Day, all day. My living room became Grand Central Station. There were teenagers everywhere eating all our food and taking over the house. Khalifa, this is too many people. But mom, I'm not leaving the house. I'm following the rules. Rule No. 3, no phone during family dinner. So I started bringing a tablet instead. Khalifa, put that away. It's not a phone, dad. The rule specifically says no phone. He changed it to no electronic devices during dinner. So I brought a book and read it at the table out loud. Chapter 12, the Vampire's Passionate Embrace left Bella breathless as his cold lips. Khalifa, he updated it to no distractions during family dinner. So I started asking really personal questions instead. Dad, when did you lose your virginity? Khalifa, mom, what's the most embarrassing thing you did in high school? I'm not distracted. I'm fully engaged in family conversation. Rule No. 4, curfew is eleven PM on weekends. So I started coming home at ten fifty nine PM every single weekend on the dot. I'd sit in Jake's car until 10:58, then sprint to the door and burst in. At 10:59, I'm home. My parents would be waiting by the door like worried prison guards. After a month, my dad said, Khalifa, the spirit of the rule is that you should be home at a reasonable time. But dad, 10:00 fifty nine is a reasonable time. It's before 11. Rule No. 5, you must clean your room once A week. So I cleaned it every Sunday at eleven fifty nine PM loudly. I'd vacuum, move furniture and blast music. My parents bedroom shared a wall with mine. Khalifa, it's midnight. Sorry. Just following the rules. Today's Sunday. My mom changed it to clean your room once a week during reasonable hours. So I started cleaning it at 6:00am on Sunday mornings. Still loudly. Khalifa, people are sleeping. 6:00am is reasonable. It's daytime. The final straw came when they made rule No. 6, no loopholes. Follow the spirit of the rules, not just the letter. So I printed out the definition of loopholes and highlighted the part that said an ambiguity or inadequacy in the law or a set of rules. Mom, dad, according to Miriam Webster, loopholes exist because rules are poorly written. If you don't want me to find loopholes, write better rules. I presented them with a 10 page analysis of why their rules were legally insufficient, complete with citations and footnotes. My dad stared at the document for five minutes, then looked at my mom. Honey, I think we created a monster. She's going to be a lawyer, my mom sighed. A really annoying lawyer, my dad added. They called a family meeting the next day. Khalifa, we're scrapping all the rules. Really? Yes. But in exchange, you have to use common sense and good judgment. Define common sense. Khalifa, just kidding. I'll be good probably.

But I remember the car even had a nickname. What nickname he called the car? Shelby. Shelby, yes. By any chance, was the logo a snake? Yeah, that's it. But the worst part was the noise it made.

I was in science class when I grabbed what I thought was my granola bar from my bag. One bite and I knew something was wrong. The taste. Peanut butter. My friend's protein bar must have gotten mixed up with mine when we studied together. I need the emergency Epipen. I gasped, already feeling my throat tighten. I just ate peanuts. The substitute teacher looked up from her desk, where she was eating from her own bag of peanuts. Don't be dramatic. Allergies are all in your head. you don't understand. My tongue was already swelling. I left my Epipen at home, thinking I'd be fine since every classroom had emergency ones. Please, the med cabinet. Sit down. She stood up and walked to the cabinet, but instead of opening it, she leaned against it. You know what my parents did when I claimed I was allergic? The cats. They locked me in a room with three of them. By morning, I was cured. Katie jumped up and ran toward the cabinet. She's not faking. She needs help now. The sub blocked her. The only thing killing her is her own mind. Then she did something I'll never forget. She walked to the door, turned the dead bolt, and pocketed the key. No one leaves until she admits she's faking it. This victim mentality is destroying your generation. Call 9 1 1! Someone yelled, reaching for their phone. Phones in the box. Now! The sub grabs the collection box, or you're all suspended. My throat felt like someone was tightening a belt around it. Six minutes. That's all I had before the swelling became irreversible. The number my doctor made me memorize. That's when my ex, Daniel, decided to chime in. She pulled the same drama last year. The sub smiled at him. See? Even he knows you're faking. She walked back to my desk with her bag of peanuts. My parents proved allergies are psychological. When I was five, she grabbed a handful and slowly, deliberately crushed them over my desk. Exposure therapy. This is for your own good. The dust fell everywhere. Blood started dripping from my nose. My lips were swelling. Katie screamed, look at her! The sub shoved Katie back down. Psychosomatic reaction. She believes she's dying, so her body mimics it. That's when Tommy touched his neck. And I guess he was allergic, too, because his eyes started swelling shut. I can't see! I can't see! Everyone lost it. Kids were dumping entire backpacks on the floor, throwing contents everywhere. Does anyone have an Epipen? Sarah was sobbing, using her shirt to wipe blood from my nose. Please don't die. Please don't die. Jack ran to the door and started pulling on it. Open this right now, please! The sub laughed. Sit down or you're expelled. Jack kept yanking on the door handle, the whole frame rattling. Help! Somebody! Other kids joined him. Pounding on the door with their fists. Through the door window, Mister Peterson from next door looked in. The sub stepped in front of the window, blocking his view, and gave a thumbs up before closing the blind. He walked away. This is kidnapping! Katie screamed. Three minutes left. Blood dripped from my nose onto my desk. Tommy was clawing at his throat. Lisa was in the corner, vomiting from pure panic. Two girls were huddled together, crying. Some kids just sat frozen at their desks, unable to move. The sub actually laughed.

 #MLBTradeDeadline#Phillies#BaseballUpdates#SportsNews","phillies,sportsnews,mlbtradedeadline,jhoanduran,baseballupdates","Woman doing my bikini wax saw my C section scar and said, but this is from twins. I've never been pregnant, and my husband had a vasectomy. I was getting my regular bikini wax when my esthetician, Rosa, suddenly stopped and examined my lower abdomen closely. She traced a finger along a scar I'd had for three years and said, this is definitely from twins. See how the incision extends further? Single births don't require this length. My blood went cold. I'd never been pregnant. Husband Tom had a vasectomy before we met, and the scar was from an emergency appendectomy I'd had while visiting his parents. Rosa had worked as a surgical nurse for 15 years before becoming an aesthetician. She insisted this was a C section scar, specifically from a multiple birth. She showed me photos on her phone comparing appendectomy scars to C section scars. Mine was textbook cesarean. The placement, the curve, the way it had healed. She said whoever did this had delivered babies from my body. I felt sick trying to remember that week three years ago. Tom's parents lived in rural Montana. I'd gotten severely ill during our visit. Intense abdominal pain, fever, confusion. Tom and his mother rushed me to a small clinic where his childhood friend Derek was the surgeon. I'd woken up three days later groggy and in pain. They said my appendix had burst, and I was lucky to be alive. Rosa convinced me to get medical records from that Clinic. When I called, they had no record of my surgery, no admission, no procedure, nothing. The receptionist said Doctor Derek Morrison had lost his license two years ago for performing illegal adoptions and hadn't worked there in four years. So who had operated on me? I confronted Tom that night and his face went white. He tried to deny it, but I'd already gotten an ultrasound that afternoon. The technician confirmed evidence of a previous pregnancy. Stretched uterine tissue, specific scarring patterns that only occur after carrying multiples. My body had carried twins to near full term. Tom broke down and confessed everything. Three years ago, I'd been drugged at his parents house. While unconscious, they discovered I was pregnant with twins Tom had somehow fathered. Despite his supposed vasectomy, he'd never actually had one. The pregnancy was from when he'd been drugging me monthly, trying to get me pregnant without my consent. When I did get pregnant, they decided to take the babies without telling me. His mother was infertile and desperate for grandchildren. When I got pregnant, they saw an opportunity. Derek performed the C section in a veterinary clinic Tom's father owned. They kept me sedated for a week while I recovered, telling me I'd had appendic surgery. The twins were given to Tom's sister, Rachel, who'd been faking a pregnancy. She'd raised them as her own for three years. I called the police immediately. They arrested Tom, his parents, Derek and Rachel. That night at Rachel's house

 #MLBTradeDeadline#Phillies#BaseballUpdates#SportsNews","phillies,sportsnews,mlbtradedeadline,jhoanduran,baseballupdates","What law did you break to do the right thing? I was at my grandparents house when my autistic little brother started riding on the floor. Ow! Ow, ow. His hand was clutching his appendix. Grandma, we need to go hospital. I told your grandfather this would happen. She interrupted. My granddad scoffed. First he has autism. Now a little stomachache is suddenly appendicitis. Our parents were at a work conference, so I tried to prove to my grandparents it was serious by asking Jamie to point to where it hurts. When he jabbed his lower right side. I explained my science teacher taught us this. Stop showing off. Grandma's voice dripped with disgust. Little miss know it all. Jamie whimpered, clutching harder. He stood up to leave the table and suddenly Grandma's hands clamped down on his shoulders. You can call it what you want, but in my day, this was called being a brat. I was just about to help Jamie do his reading exercises when he started violently erupting and vomit. Jamie must have puked for almost a minute straight. Yellow, green and red blood all over Grandma's good tablecloth. See, look what he's done to my precious tablecloth. This is what happens when you cuddle them. An unbearable wave of terror shot through me. Jamie never pukes during meltdowns, ever. Grandpa, please stop looking at your freaking newspaper. He's really sick. He finally looked up enough down or I'll give you something to really cry about. My parents would have already been halfway to the hospital before I could respond. They hauled Jamie to his feet. Grandma held him vertical while Jamie's little hands clawed at his side and tears rolled down his cheeks. Walk. Prove you're faking. Every muscle in his tiny body was shaking. Stop the dramatics. These are literally all the appendicitis symptoms. What do you know? You're 12. Grandma examined her nails, teaching him to be weak just like your parents. I rushed to Jamie while they bickered about discipline. My hand touched his forehead and I jerked back. His skin was hot. His eyes rolled back. We were losing him. I lunged for the phone, but Grandpa was faster beat. We're the adults here, he said before unplugging it from the wall. Jamie crawled toward the bathroom like a worm on a hot pavement, one hand clutching his side, the other pulling his body forward. I sat frozen in place, too scared to move. Grandpa stepped over him to lock the bathroom door. Corner. Now until you learn to behave. I tried to convince myself that maybe he really was faking, that everything would be okay. But that's when I saw it. Silent tears. Jamie only cries silently when he's in physical pain. I couldn't take it anymore. For goodness sake, he's dying right in front of you and you don't even care. Grandma rolled her eyes. Drama runs in your family. Granddad cranked up the TV volume, anything to drown Out the sound of his helpless grandson losing his life enough. I spotted Grandpa's car keys on the counter. They were both too busy arguing about kids these days to see me grabbing them. As soon as I made my way out the back door, I mashed the car key buttons as fast as I could. Only took a few seconds before the car alarm went off. Beep, beep, beep, beep. I pressed again. Beep, beep, beep. I didn't even care that our city had strict noise laws. I just dove behind the car and kept pressing. Missus Lee came out first, then Mister Park, then the pills nurse. Grandpa burst through the back door. What the hell is going on? Beep, beep, beep. My brother is dying, I screamed over the alarm. They won't call 9, 1, 1. He has appendicitis. Missus Lee, the retired nurse, didn't hesitate. She pushed past my useless grandfather. More neighbors followed. I kept hitting that car alarm like my life depended on it because Jamie's did. Missus of Lee took one look at Jamie and called 9, 1, 1 herself. Then came the sirens. Finally, two EMTs rushed in with a stretcher. The female EMT dropped beside Jamie, her hands moving fast. Jamie didn't even flinch. That's how far gone he was. How long has he been like this? She was already getting an oxygen mask ready. My grandparents wouldn't. I started. Possible rupture. She called to her partner. We're going hot. They Moved like lightning. He looked so small. So still is he. I couldn't finish my sentence. T's eyes met mine as they wheeled him out. We need to move now. Grandpa was still insisting we were overreacting. As they loaded Jamie into the ambulance, the door slammed shut, sirens screaming, racing against time. His appendix burst during surgery. But what happened next would haunt our family forever. Full story on channel link below.

My coworker Derek had been stealing my ideas for months. It started with small things. I'd mention a new marketing strategy in a meeting and the next day he'd pitch it to our boss as his own. When I confronted him, he'd laugh it off. Just a coincidence, he say. We're on the same wavelength. But I knew better. I started noticing he'd schedule one on one meetings with our boss right after our team brainstorming sessions. He'd casually asked to see my notes, claiming he wanted to build on my ideas. Then he present them as his own brilliant insights. Our boss loved him. Derek got the corner office while I was stuck in a cubicle. He received praise for campaigns I designed. He even won employee of the month for a project where I did 80% of the work. The worst part was how he patronized me afterward. Hey buddy, good job supporting the team. I couldn't have done it without you. Then he'd wink like we shared some secret understanding. I tried documenting my contributions, sending email summaries after meetings, but Derek was always one step ahead. He'd respond to my emails, twisting my words to make it seem like I was building on his ideas. When I spoke up in meetings, he'd interrupt with phrases like what Tom is trying to say is and then restate my point more eloquently. I was getting desperate. The annual marketing competition. Was coming up, our company's biggest event. The winner would receive a 10 thousand dollar bonus and and almost certainly a promotion. I've been developing a revolutionary campaign for months, late nights, weekends, sacrificed all for this perfect pitch. I kept everything on my personal laptop, didn't share a single detail with anyone. Three days before the competition, I noticed Derek hovering near my desk when I returned from lunch. Just stretching my legs, he said with that same ug smile. That night, I discovered my laptop was missing from my bag. I tore my apartment apart looking for it, nothing. The next morning, Derek called in sick. I knew exactly what was happening. He'd stolen my laptop to access my campaign. With the competition just two days away, I had nothing. I considered dropping out but decided on a different approach. I worked 48 hours straight, barely sleeping, creating an entirely new campaign. It wasn't as polished as my original, but it was solid. The day of the competition arrived, eight contestants would present to the entire company and a panel of industry judges. Derek went sixth, looking confident in his expensive suit. As soon as his presentation began, I recognized my original campaign slide for slide, word for word. He'd even kept my personal examples and analogies, claiming they were his experiences. The room was impressed, judges nodding appreciatively. I was scheduled last. When my turn came, I didn't present my new campaign. Instead, I connected my phone. To the projector and.

 #MLBTradeDeadline #Phillies#BaseballUpdates #SportsNews","phillies,sportsnews,mlbtradedeadline,jhoanduran,baseballupdates","What's the most out of touch thing a rich person has said to you? When I was 16, I lied on a job application and said I was 18 so I could clean these massive vacation houses in Aspen. My mom had died three months before from diabetes complications because we couldn't afford her insulin consistently. I was living with my aunt, who worked double shifts at a gas station just to keep our tiny apartment. These houses I cleaned were insane. Like bathrooms bigger than our entire place with marble everything. And those fancy toilets that cost more than my aunt made in six months. I'd scrub these pristine kitchens that probably got used twice during their whole vacation. One Thursday afternoon, I was mopping the hallway in this ridiculous mansion when I heard screaming from upstairs. This 14 year old girl named Sienna was having a complete meltdown at her dad because he wouldn't buy her a second iPhone just for making tik toks. We already had the newest model, but apparently she needed a separate one for content creation. I tried to keep working, but then I heard her yell something that made my blood freeze. She screamed at her dad, if you're gonna be so annoying about money, why don't you just divorce mom and marry someone richer instead? I gripped that mop handle so tight, my knuckles went white. My mom had died on the same couch I slept on every night. We eating ramen, For dinner probably 300 days that year. Sienna stormed out of the room and saw me standing there in the hallway. She rolled her eyes and said, ah, I hate when the help just stands around doing nothing. I wanted to say something, but I needed this job desperately, so I just kept mopping and pretended I didn't hear anything. Later, I was cleaning their kitchen when Sienna came in talking to her friend on speaker phone. She. I was still ranting about the phone situation, saying stuff like, my dad is literally so cheap. I cried for like an hour and he still said no. It's so unfair. What am I supposed to do? Use the same phone as last year like some poor person? I couldn't help myself. I said quietly, I think you're pretty lucky to even have one phone. She looked at me like I just spoken a foreign language. What are you poor or something? I didn't answer. I just kept wiping down their marble countertops. Probably cost more than my mom's medical bills. Then Sienna actually laughed. Not a mean laugh, but like she just solved a puzzle. Oh my god, just ask your mom to buy you one. That's literally what I do when my dad says no. Moms are way easier. My chest felt tight. I said really quietly, my mom died in October.

I almost ignored the call and I saw it was from my son's school, Missus Brooks. I'm calling about Ryan. The dean's voice was ice cold, each word carefully measured, like she was trying not to scream. There's been an incident. He struck a female student in his dorm room this afternoon. My stomach dropped. This had to be a mistake. That's not possible. Ryan, doesn't she cut me off. The girl has visible injuries. Campus police are here and they're considering assault charges. Need to come immediately. I've also contacted the young woman's mother. I was already halfway to my car before my brain caught up. Ryan had earned a full engineering scholarship through years of grinding, perfect grades, zero trouble. Now I had three hours of driving to figure out how this made any sense. When I, when I arrived at the administration building at six thirty PM, I found Ryan sitting outside the dean's office with two campus police officers standing nearby. His face was pale and his hands trembled in his lap. Through the window of another office, I could see the girl, Sophia, surrounded by her friends who were taking photos and posting on social media. Her cheeks showed a red Mark and she was crying dramatically for her growing audience. Ryan, what happened? I whispered, sitting beside him while the officers watched. Mom, I hit her. I slapped her. His voice cracked and he couldn't meet my eyes. Everyone saw her run out of my room crying with that Mark on her face. Her friends are calling me a woman beater and the whole campus knows already. Dean Whitfield emerged from her office with another security officer, Missus Brooks. The facts seem clear. Multiple witnesses saw Sophia run from Ryan's room in distress with visible injury. She says they had an argument and he struck her. We have zero tolerance for domestic violence on this campus, senior officer added grimly. The girl's friends are already organizing a protest. They want him expelled immediately. We've had to post extra security at his dorm. I looked at my son, who still hadn't made eye contact with me once since I'd arrived. Ryan, tell me exactly what happened. He shook his head slowly. It doesn't matter what really happened. I hit her and that's all anyone cares about. No, I said firmly, feeling something wasn't right. Tell me everything. Ryan finally looked up and there was something in his eyes I'd never seen before, pure terror mixed with shame. I was taking a nap, mom. I told her I wasn't in the mood for anything earlier and said I needed to sleep before my evening lab. I woke up to find she had pulled down my blankets and was doing things to me without my consent. The security officer shifted uncomfortably. Dean Whitfield's confident expression began to falter as She processed this information. When I woke up to her touching me like that, I just reacted. It was like I was 8 years old again, back in that house with Grandpa. His voice broke completely. My body moved on its own. I slapped her and she fell off the bed. I felt my blood run cold. I knew about those weekends at his grandfather's house, trauma he'd never fully discussed, but that had shaped so much of his life. I turned to the dean. My son was sexually assaulted. He defended himself. That's quite an accusation to make, the dean said carefully. The doubt had crept into her voice. Just then the door opened and a woman in her 50s entered, looking exhausted and defeated. Dean Whitfield, I'm Patricia, Sophia's mother. You called me. The dean nodded yes. Please have a seat. Patricia looked at Ryan and her face crumbled. Which trauma was it? Car accident, abuse? Let me guess something from childhood. Everyone in the room froze. How did you. The dean started. Because my daughter has a.

Like be fucking for real. We have self driving cars AI that can literally deep fake the Pope in a puffer jacket and y'all are still sitting here debating whether to save the grown ass woman who birthed the baby or the baby. Any human with a functioning brain cell, just one, would obviously choose the mom. Like why is saving the baby even an option? That's like asking would you rather save this apple or the fucking tree it came from? And spoiler alert if the tree dies, there's no more apples, dumbass. The mom could literally go on and have another baby whenever the hell she wants. But if she dies, boom, game over, no response. Done. And the craziest part is some of y'all act like the baby is some celebrity we already know and love. No bitch, it's a stranger. A random tiny human I have never met. And you wanna kill me for that? Nah. If I'm ever in the situation, let me make it very fucking clear. You better save my life over some random baby that has not paid a single Bill in his life? I carried that thing for nine months, my back broke, my ankle swelled, my body went through literal war, and you think you're gonna let me die?

Everyone told me that I put down a girl, and that's wrong. But I don't care. I do it a million times if I had to. By sixth grade, I grew taller than everyone else, which cool. But I was a bit overweight, which never helped. By seventh, I stood a foot over most girls and weighed more, too. I got loud when I was nervous. A girl named Kira liked that. She had shiny hair, a clean hoodie, and a laugh that pulled people in. It start farted. In the cafeteria, I sat with two girls from band, trying to eat slow. Kira slid by my table and tapped the corner of my mouth like I had crumbs. I wiped, found nothing. Then Jim. We ran laps while the teacher clicked a stopwatch. My legs burned. Kira paced me for one lap and leaned close. She whispered, eat less, then sprinted ahead like she'd broken a record. By winter, the group chat made it worse. Someone posted a picture of my back on the bus. The caption said, Fix Zilla takes homeroom. I muted my phone and shoved it into my bag. I knew more about Kira than she thought. In sixth grade, a girl from her street whispered a story. Police cars outside her house one night. Her dad dead, her mom arrested. I didn't trust it until I searched on my school Chromebook. A short article appeared. With her street name and a line about a family fight, reading it felt like holding a secret I didn't want. I closed the tab and told no one. I even tried to be kinder. I held doors for her, said hi in the hall, told myself her jokes came from pain. If I stayed calm, maybe she'd get bored. She didn't. She watched my plate at lunch and shook her head. She filmed my mile time and posted it. She called me Big Show when I walked past her friends. Spirit week, she told the cheer girls. I stretched out the Pep rally shirt on the bus when we hit a pothole and I grabbed the rail. She laughed and said the bus didn't stand a chance. In health class, she asked if stretch marks meant someone let themselves go, and a few kids glanced at me before looking away. I Learned to breathe through it. In my room, I jogged in place with a fan on thighs, rubbing out a low sound. I saved that page like a scar. The day it broke started like any Tuesday. The gym smelled like body spray and old rubber. We'd run the mile outside and came in to change. Lockers clanked sneakers. Grape. I peeled my shirt off, silver stretch marks flashing across my hips and thighs from growing too fast. I dug through my bag too long for my clean tea. Kira stood at the end of the bench with A bottle of shimmer spray. She pointed at my skin. Her voice carried, wow, look at those stretch marks. Maybe save some lunch money for lotion. Heads turned. A water bottle rolled off a bench and bumped the tile. Two cheer girls stifled laughs. The girl from math stared at the floor. Someone whispered, stop, but it was weak. My eyes stung. Heat climbed my neck. Then the fan in my head went quiet. For two years, I'd carried her secret like glass. I'd taken the stairs, the jokes, the photos. I'd given her chances to stop. But she picked the locker room, the loudest place. She picked my body. As I'm the biggest target. She wanted an easy laugh. I turned and faced her. My voice came out steady. Sorry. I have parents who feed me. When your dad is dead and your mom's in jail for killing him

Shaquille O'neal wasn't just a Tesla customer. He was a super fan, a full on believer in Elon Musk's bold electric dream. He didn't buy one or two. He bought three cyber trucks, hoping to be part of the revolution. But this week, Shaq confirmed he's out. He sold every single one of them. And while Shaq's name makes headlines, the real story is the truck itself. Once marketed as a symbol of innovation, the cyber truck has quickly become a rolling punchline. Within just 12 months, its value has dropped by over 35%, outpacing every pickup in America five times faster than a Ford F1 50. Shack summed it up better than anyone. Owning a cyber truck doesn't make you look powerful. It makes you look like a test subject in a failed experiment. Tesla said this was the future, but it's shedding owners, losing trust, and sinking in value faster than anyone expected.

My husband and I adopted our daughter Zoe when she was 6 years old. She'd been in the foster system for three years after being removed from a severely neglectful home. Zoe had been placed with three different families before us, but each time the adoptive parents sent her back to foster care when her behavioral issues became too difficult to handle. Zoe's first day with us seemed to go well. She was quiet but polite, said thank you for everything and didn't cause any trouble. That night, we showed her to her new bedroom. We'd spent weeks decorating it, pink walls, stuffed animals and a comfortable bed with soft blankets. This is your room, Zoe. Everything here is yours. She nodded and whispered thank you. We tucked her in, read her a bedtime story and said good night. But around 2:00am, I woke up and decided to check on her. Her bedroom was empty. I found her in the kitchen, pulled up on the floor behind the refrigerator, wide awake. Zoe, sweetie, what are you doing down here? She looked terrified. I'm sorry. I'll go back upstairs. Why are you sleeping on the floor? This is where I'm supposed to sleep. My heart broke, honey, you have a beautiful bed upstairs. That's your bed. But I was bad today. Bad. You weren't bad at all. I spilled water at dinner and I forgot to say thank You when you gave me the towel, Zoe, those aren't bad things. Those are just normal things that happen. In my old house, when I was bad, I had to sleep on the kitchen floor. I started crying. This little girl thought she was being punished and had put herself in time out on our kitchen floor. This went on for two weeks. Every night she would sneak downstairs to sleep on the kitchen floor. The breakthrough came when our social worker suggested we ask Zoe what would make her feel safe in her bed. I don't know, Zoe said quietly. I've never had a bed that was really mine. What do you mean? In my old house, I slept on the couch, but if Mommy's boyfriend was mad, I had to sleep on the floor. In foster homes, they said the bed was mine, but then I'd have to leave. That's when I understood she was afraid of getting attached to something that might be taken away. Zoe, would it help if we wrote your name on something so you know it's really yours? Her eyes lit up like with a marker. I handed her a permanent marker. Write your name anywhere you want. Zoe carefully wrote Zoe on the headboard of her bed, then on her dresser, then on the wall next to her bed. That night, for the first time, Zoe slept in her bed all night. But we weren't done with challenges. A few days later, I made spaghetti and meatballs. She ate everything, asked for seconds, then thirds. Zoe, you don't have to eat everything right now. There will be more food tomorrow. She looked panicked. But what if there isn't? Zoe was hoarding food because she'd Learned that meals weren't guaranteed. But the biggest shock came in late October when I mentioned Halloween was coming up. She looked terrified. Halloween? Yes, sweetie. We're going to get you a costume and go trick or treating. She started crying. No, I have to hide. I have to go in the closet.

And it makes it really fucking hard when your toddler all the sudden has this refined palette. Didn't realize she was such a fine fucking diner. Didn't realize she had such expensive taste. I've witnessed that little bitch eat Skittles off the sidewalk. Those could have been anybody's Skittles, and they ended up in her stomach after god knows how many days of being out there in the sun. But my meatloaf's a problem. Yeah, I put a meatloaf that I spent a good amount of time working on with some Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. I said, eat this, and she goes, hmm, it looks kind of weird. And I was like, I don't give a fuck. Eat it, eat it. I made it. And then she eats it, and she goes, hmm, I guess it's not that bad, bitch. Says who? Says you. You, the skittle eater. The public skittle eater. Fuck around, dude. And all of a sudden she doesn't like Velveeta Mac and cheese. I want Kraft. I want Kraft.
