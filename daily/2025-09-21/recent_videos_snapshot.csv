My 16 year old Sophie had been begging for AirPods Pro all summer, the new 300 dollar model. She'd researched every feature, watched countless unboxing videos, even created a detailed comparison chart showing why the Pro version was essential for her aesthetic. Her birthday arrived and I surprised her with the exact model. I was so proud finding them in stock when they've been sold out everywhere. Her face dropped the second she opened the box. Um, these are the regular AirPods Pro. She held them like they were defective. I specifically said I need the AirPods Pro Max. Everyone at school has the Max version now. These make me look poor. The Max version. This kid wanted the $600 over ear headphones that cost more than my car payment. Her music career consisted of making 15 second TikTok dance videos to trending songs. The Pro version has the same sound quality I explained trying to salvage the moment. These are what actual musicians use for professional work. Mom, nobody cares about sound quality. It's about the look. These tiny earbuds are so basic. The max ones are a statement piece. Was already putting them back in the box. Can you just return these and get the right ones? It's only like 300 bucks more. Only 300 bucks more. Like I was made of money that stung deep. I'd specifically researched which model music professionals recommended. I'd read reviews, compared features. Even asked my friend who works in audio production. I'll think about it, I said quietly, taking the box from her. She was already back on her phone. Thanks, mom. You're the best. Make sure you get the space gray ones, not silver. Silver looks cheap on camera. I just nodded and walked away. Next day, I'm at Apple Store standing in the return line, still feeling terrible about the whole situation. The line was moving slowly and I could hear the customer service conversation happening ahead of me. I'm sorry, ma'am, your card was declined again. Do you want to try a different payment method? I looked up from my phone. A woman about my age wearing scrubs with Maria embroidered on them was standing there with her teenage son. He couldn't have been older than 15, wearing a faded band T-shirt and holding her hand supportively. Um, let me try this one, Maria said, pulling out a different card. Her hands were shaking slightly. Sorry, Miguel. I thought I had enough after paying rent. This one declined too, the employee said gently. The boy immediately stepped forward. It's okay, mom. I don't really need new earbuds for school. My old ones still work fine for online classes. Maria's shoulders sagged like someone had just crushed her dreams. Miho, you've been using those broken earbuds for two years. The left one doesn't even work anymore. And you need them for your virtual music lessons. Maybe next month I'll have Better tips from work, she said, her voice cracking. Your music teacher said you have real talent. You deserve proper equipment. Mom, sharing one earbud with my study group is fine. Besides, my music sounds better when we listen to.

So I drove him straight into another state while he slept. Mr Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper, just throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he'd always had his favorite line. In the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into driver's ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my, it dropped like a stone. Where do I turn, I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise, though with your steering. Straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchange looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight with you girls. Never know when we're Gonna stop or if we're gonna stop. By the third lesson we discovered his pattern. He'd make his nasty jokes for 20 minutes then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practice highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed. He's when I've beard slightly, I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife if we survive today's lesson. That is 3 teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon Sophia slightly veered and he exploded. Jesus, are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high and why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My 5 year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I and then he was snoring head tilted back against the headrest, looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realized he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up on the right And I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five North hanging over the highway. Like a dare, I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering. I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added, me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank, then back at the sleeping Mister Maya. And as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. Thirty minutes passed, then an hour and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up constantly with white.

I paid for this so I'm keeping it moment. My ex wife Emma thought she was so clever during our divorce. We've been married eight years and when things went south, she hired this shark lawyer who promised to take me for everything I had. The divorce was brutal. She wanted the house, both cars, half my business and spousal support. Her lawyer kept saying I was hiding assets and demanded access to all my financial records going back five years. But there was one thing Emma really wanted, my signed Jersey collection. I've been collecting them since high school. Mickey Mantle, Joe Montana, Michael Jordan, worth about $30,000 total. Emma hated that collection, always called it my stupid sports shrine and said it was a waste of money. But now that we were splitting up, suddenly she wanted half of everything, including jerseys she'd mocked for years. Her lawyer argued that since we bought some of them during the marriage, she was entitled to 50% of the collection. The Mickey Mantle alone was worth 12 grand. I tried explaining that most of these were gifts for my dad or things I'd saved up for with my own money before we even met. Didn't matter. Her lawyer wanted receipts for everything. So I spent weeks digging through old boxes, finding every receipt, every certificate of authenticity, every piece of paper that proved when and how I got each Jersey. That's when I found something interesting, the Michael Jordan Jersey, the crown jewel of my collection, worth $15,000. I had the original receipt from 2019, but it wasn't purchased by me. It was purchased by Emma as a surprise for my fortyth birthday. She'd spent months tracking it down through collectors, paid full price, even had it professionally framed. I'll never forget her face when my lawyer presented that receipt in court. She went completely white as he explained that according to her own legal argument, she just proved the most valuable item in my collection legally belonged to her. Her lawyer tried to backtrack, saying it was a gift and gifts don't count. But my lawyer was ready. He pulled out the divorce papers where Emma's team had specifically argued that the source of payment determined ownership, not the intent. The judge looked annoyed. He asked Emma's lawyer if they wanted to change their legal strategy, which would mean starting the entire asset division process over again. That would cost them another six months and 20,000 in legal fees. Emma was trapped by her own greed. If she backed down, she'd lose her claim to everything else. If she pushed forward, she'd have to give me the Jordan Jersey. While fighting for jerseys worth half as much, her lawyer whispered something in her ear. She shook her head violently. They whispered more. Finally, she slumped back in her chair, looking defeated. Fine, she said through gritted teeth. He can keep his stupid jerseys. But I wasn't done. I Stood up and addressed the judge directly. I'd like to make a counter offer regarding the Michael Jordan Jersey. Everyone looked confused. My own lawyer didn't know what I was planning. According to the receipt, my ex wife purchased this Jersey. According to her legal argument, that makes it hers. I don't want to take something that doesn't belong to me. Emma's eyes lit up. She thought I was giving her a 15 thousand dollar dollar victory. However, I continued. I'd like to.

I was the only night keeper at our aquarium who could handle Poseidon, our four million dollar giant Pacific octopus. And that evening he wrapped all eight arms around my forearm to gently pull crab from my beating tongues. His massive 200 pound body moved with surprising Grace through the crystal clear water of his tank. But when any other keeper approached, the same gentle creature became a destructive nightmare that sprayed black ink everywhere and destroyed thousands of dollars worth of equipment. Our new operations director Caroline watched from the observation deck with her arms crossed, clearly unimpressed by what she called my animal dependency problem during yesterday's staff meeting. She believed every creature should have multiple handlers because no single employee should be irreplaceable, especially not because of some oversized sea creature that cost more than most people's houses. Caroline has spent three weeks documenting every minor violation she manufacturer. Writing me up for wearing a different brand of reef safe sunscreen than the one corporate required, even though their brand gave me hives and docking my pay when Poseidon's complex eating routine ran five minutes over my scheduled break. Her masterpiece was hiring Tim, her former assistant manager who spent entire shifts taking Instagram selfies near the shark tank and had never worked with cephalopods in his 24 years of existence. Poseidon hated Tim with the burning intensity of a thousand suns shooting pressurized water jets That soaked him completely whenever he approached the tank. And once Tim slept so dramatically on the wet observation deck that he crashed through a three thousand dollar interactive display about octopus intelligence, Tim's solution was to stand 15 feet away from the tank and throw food pellets like he was feeding pigeons at the park, which made Poseidon retreat to his cave and refuse to eat for two entire days. Then disaster struck on Wednesday evening when major marine research donors were arriving for a private feeding demonstration at 8:30, specifically to see our famous octopus interact with his primary caregiver. Twenty minutes before the VIP tour, Caroline cornered me in the equipment room while I prepared Poseidon's dinner of fresh dungeness crab and puzzle feeders. Tim will handle tonight's demonstration, she announced with fake authority dripping from every word. You're needed in the children's touch tank area for deep cleaning duties. Everyone in that equipment room knew exactly what would happen if Tim approached Poseidon during feeding time, when the octopus was most territorial and aggressive. But I looked Caroline directly in the eyes and explained, obvious anyway, the sign won't accept food from Tim and he becomes violent when strangers approach during his dinner routine. Caroline snapped back that we'd manage without the feeding demonstration and gave me a direct order to report to the children's area immediately or face consequences. I slowly unclipped my security badge and identification card, placing both items on the stainless Steel prep counter. While our senior aquarist and two night staff members watched this confrontation unfold in stunned silence, I pulled out my phone to start recording and told Caroline that the sign was in full hunting mode because it was feeding time and Tim knew where all the equipment was stored. Caroline's face turned bright red when she realized I was documenting our conversation for legal purposes. If you walk out of this building, you're terminated immediately and permanently. I replied calmly that this was perfectly fine with me, already hearing Poseidon's agitated flashing echoing from the deep sea exit two rooms away. I'm recording this for unemployment documentation since you're firing me for refusing to endanger a 4 million dollar animal and potentially injure your completely inexperienced employee. I walked out of the building and barely made it to the parking lot before my phone started buzzing with frantic calls and text messages. Twelve missed calls came in during the first four minutes, starting with panicked messages from our senior Aquarius describing how Poseidon had grabbed Tim's entire arm through the feeding spot and refused to let go no matter.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from Accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. A crowd formed to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. Crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space, someone yelled. Laughter erupted. The CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was ex.

After watching my dad hit my mom for years, I finally hit him back and ended up in a psych ward. They classified me as violent. So I spent 7 months in a white room with nothing but my thoughts. When I was finally released, all I wanted was a family of my own, one built on love, not fear. That's how I met Noah. He was 6, living in a group home after being removed from his fourth foster placement. The social worker warned me he was challenging, code for traumatized. But when I saw him sitting alone, methodically lining up broken crayons by size, something in my heart cracked open. I sat down beside him and asked what he was drawing. Without looking up, he said a house with no yelling. I noticed burn marks on his arms, perfectly circular cigarette burns. I had similar scars, only mine were from my dad's cigars. The first few weeks were rough. Noah tested every boundary, waiting for me to snap. He'd break things, scream that he hated me, try to run away. But I never raised my voice, never threatened, never hit. Instead, I'd sit with him during his meltdowns, speaking softly until his breathing steadied. One night, I found him in the kitchen at 3 a. M. Stuffing cereal into his pockets. I'm not mad, I said, keeping my distance. But can you tell me why his voice was barely A whisper in case you change your mind about me. Like everyone else, I opened the pantry, showing him the extra shelves I'd installed. This is your food, too. You'll never go hungry here, I promise. Slowly, things improved. He started sleeping through the night, stopped hoarding food, called me dad for the first time after I spent hours helping him build a blanket fort. Then he showed up at our door claiming he changed, found god wanted his son. Noah hid under his bed when he heard that voice, shaking so hard the frame rattled. The custody battle was brutal. His father had family money, hired expensive lawyers. They painted me as unstable because of my psych ward. Stay said a single man couldn't properly raise a traumatized child. But Noah's therapist testified about his progress. His teachers described his transformation from a silent, scared kid to an engaged student who helped younger children. The judge listened. The final hearing was yesterday. Noah squeezed my hand so tight it hurt as his father made one last plea. Then the judge looked at Noah and asked what he wanted. He stood up straight, looked his birth father in the eye and said, I already have a dad, the kind who builds forts and doesn't hurt people. Walking out of that courthouse, adoption papers finally signed no. It turned to me, can we get ice cream? Of course, buddy. Dad. Those other foster homes, they said I was too broken. That No one would want to keep me. I knelt down, meeting his eyes. You were never broken. You were waiting for someone who understood. At night, I heard him crying in his room. When I checked on him, he was organizing his crayons again. But this time, he was drawing our house with both of us inside, smiling. See, he said, pointing, no yelling. Now, whenever Noah has a hard day, we build a fort.

We're just calling to check in with people, see how they're doing. It's part of our service. Yeah, right. Haha. I'm actually calling you because somebody emailed us about you. Oh, God. Tell me this is not a freaking second date update. I'd love to do that, but it is a second date update. Oh, God. And you recently went out with a guy named Jay. Oh my God. Haha. You're calling me about Jay? Yes, I am. Jay emailed us and told us about your date, said that it was really awkward because his co worker came along. And then after the date, he texted you like, hey, I'm sorry about that. We should try it again. And you texted him back that you weren't interested. Yeah, that's. I can't believe that he told you all that. Well, he obviously liked you a lot and wants to see you again. So what's the reason that you told him it wouldn't possibly work?

So is that the only reason that you're not calling him back? Because of his coworker? No, the coworker cried the whole time. And to comfort him, he started to saying horrible things about the girl.

Yes. Oh, you can do better. I mean, she has a nice set of boobs, but that's all. And he was saying this in front of you and what were you doing? I was like, yeah, I hope it gets better for you. There's more out there. But can't you give them. I mean, you can throw a bone on that one. It's not like you've never comforted a girlfriend by talking about what a loser her ex was. Bro talk on a date. Yeah, I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say that in front of another girl. Be like, oh, dude, she's a waste. You're saying horrible. Like she had man hands. You don't want her. I mean, and then the part where I was like, okay, I need to leave is when they started asking me for friends because the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else. Haha. So he was asking if you Had any friends that his buddy could hook up with? Okay, can you call somebody and get them here right away? Oh my God. So that maybe he can sleep with someone. Really? Yeah. That's when I was like, okay, I'm gonna see you later. He actually asked you if you had a friend that would sleep with him. Yes. And could I get them on the phone right now? Oh my god. That is. What was your response to that? I was horrified and disgusted and I tried to extricate myself from the situation and said I need to leave. Was there like anything enjoyable about the date? I mean, it was funny on the outside. I'm glad I wasn't you know, emotionally involved at that point. Did you ever for once think about a friend you're like, oh, I bet you she'd do it and then almost call them? No, no, no, not at all. Can't even go there. Okay, so Michelle, I know that it sounds like you're a listener to the show and I don't know how many second date updates you listen to, but maybe you forgot that Jay is actually on the other line listening right now. No, I figured that was coming. I'm glad that he got to hear all that. Oh, okay, Jay. Well, you know, you there? Yeah, I'm here. Haha. Pretty harsh recap, Jay. Listen to what she just said. I I I I can't believe she's like saying this. Kind of stuff.

I care about my teenage boy, but I'd be dishonest if I said I wasn't let down by the kind of person he's becoming. My son began getting into this different look back when he was in middle school. At first he just wore black clothes, but once he got to high school, he's gone way too far with his strange style and I really don't like it. My wife doesn't seem to mind, but she's a pretty passive woman and has never been a very strict parent like me. If I were to describe how my son dresses now, he wears big, baggy black clothing and lots of chains and rings. At one point, he was even dying coloured strips into his hair. I remember being so upset the first day I saw this. It was just so embarrassing to see my child walking around like that. Now, I don't have a problem with gay people or anything like that, but I never really wanted that type of thing to be a part of my own household. I've never confronted my son about his sexuality and I really just don't wanna know if he does happen to be. Our relationship is already sort of strained and I feel like if I found out he wasn't straight, it would make it very hard for me to treat him the same. Like I said, I don't have a problem with gay people. I just don't wanna be shoved in my face on top of everything. Ever since my son entered high school, he's made friends with mostly girls. At first I was glad to see this, and I was happy that my son still might have a chance of growing up into a real man's man. But as time went on, I realised that he wasn't in a relationship with any of these girls dead. They were all just his close friends. He constantly has his friends over the house and is part of a friend group with three other girls. To be fair, these girls have always been nothing but polite to me and my wife and are always respectful of our house. Still, it just rubs me the wrong way that my son doesn't seem to have any close guy friends, and I feel like it's not good for him to grow up that way. I tried my best to be non judgmental towards my son, even though to me he looked like more of a freak of nature. Every day the more he kept leaning into his alternative fashion. I didn't understand it, since all of his friends were normal girls. He was the only weirdo in his friend group who dressed like some 90s mall rat. When I look at him, he honestly reminds me of the kind of kids I would pick on in high school. Anyway, about a Year ago, I ran out of patience with him when he came home one day with his nails painted a shade of bright blue. My son had never done anything like this before, and I couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly disgusted. I. I told him that he had gone too far with his emo bullshit and that I couldn't continue letting him make a fool out of himself like this. I told him that at one point he needed to become a man, and painting his nails made him look like some sort of weak top. My son and I had never really been close. We didn't even speak that often, so he looked very hurt as I was telling him all this. But I couldn't help it. He had needed a reality check for so long and there was no avoiding this conversation. I told my son to go get nail polish remover and remove his nail polish right there in front of me. That's when he started to get angry and said that he didn't have to change himself just to appease my dumb homophobic self. My son has never spoken to either of his parents this way, and I knew that there was no way I was letting him get away with it. I yelled at him for cursing at me like that, and I told him that he would remove his nail polish immediately or there would be serious consequences. He said that there was nothing Worse I could do to him than continue being such a hateful father. And that's when I lost my shot. I told him that I would ground him for the entire year if he didn't remove his nail polish within the next 60 seconds. Looked at me and told me that I could try, but I would never be able to control him and that he hated me. He ran up to his room after this, and I followed through on my threat. I took his phone away and replaced it with a flip phone, and he wasn't allowed to go out or have his friends over anymore. All he did after that for the rest of the year was call his friends in his room and completely ignore me. One night, I overheard him crying to my wife about how much he hated his life since being grounded. But all she said was that I was his father and he needed to respect me. Proud of my wife for sticking up to me behind closed doors. And I still felt like I had made the right decision. I won't lie and say that it hasn't been a difficult year. My son stopped talking to me the day I grounded him, and I honestly do miss him. He graduates next year, and I just hope before then he'll realise that I was only ever trying to do what was best for him.

I need extra hands. Yeah, I don't think so. I wasn't about to climb into a bathroom stall with a freak. No, please. I think I might bleed out. Her voice was shaking. And suddenly this wasn't funny anymore. It was summer from my English class, a pregnant senior who everyone whispered about but nobody really talked to. She was sitting on the toilet, gripping the handicap rail with white knuckles, and her face was covered in sweat. What's wrong? I asked, even though I was starting to guess. Please do something. I'm giving birth. She looked up at me with pure terror in her eyes. My whole body went cold. I was 17 and barely knew how tampons worked, let alone babies. But she was crying and alone, and I couldn't just leave her there. I hopped over the stall divider awkwardly and almost slipped on the wet floor. That's when I saw it. The baby was already crowning. There was blood on the toilet seat and the floor, and summer was making the low groaning sounds that scared me more than anything. This was actually happening in a gross school bathroom with fluorescent lights and graffiti on the walls. I'll be right back. I ran out of the bathroom. Still in shock. I sprinted down the hallway to Missus Bashar's classroom. She was my favourite teacher and The only adult I could think of who wouldn't freak out, I burst through her door, interrupting her lecture on photosynthesis. The whole class stared at me. I need your help urgently, please. I was out of breath and probably looked insane. Missus Bashar took one look at my face and followed me without asking questions. We ran back to the bathroom and I could hear summer sounds getting louder. Other kids were starting to peek out of classrooms wondering what was happening. Missus Bashar pushed open the stall door and immediately went into teacher mode. Okay, honey, I'm here. You're doing great. I'm going to support you while she gets the nurse. I didn't need to be told twice. I ran to the nurse's office faster than I'd ever run in PE. When I burst through the door, Nurse Patty was checking Casey's temperature. Casey, who everyone knew was Summer's boyfriend, the guy who'd been bragging about becoming a dad at prom. Summer's having her baby in the bathroom right now. I basically screamed it. Casey's face went from white to green. He threw up all over the floor before Nurse Patty could grab a trash can. But we didn't have time to deal with that. The three of us ran back to the bathroom with nurse Patty grabbing emergency supplies from her cabinet. By now, half the school had heard something was happening. Kids were crowding outside the bathroom door trying to figure out what all the screaming Was about teachers were trying to move them back to class, but nobody was listening. When we got back to the stall, it was chaos. Missus Bashar was holding Summer's hand while she pushed. The nurse immediately took over, checking how dilated she was and telling summer to breathe. Casey stood frozen in the doorway looking like he might pass out. That's when summer grabbed my hand and pulled me close. You have to get.

Well, I always stop when I'm asked to. But it's something I need to do. It's 1:00am. Do it sometime else. You're right. I'm really sorry. You should be. Don't make me have to come up there myself. I won't. Hey! Oh, sorry. I'll stop. I thought I was okay since it's early in the day. No, no, you're fine. I'm not that big of a Karen. Haha. Why did you text me then? I don't know.

But that just means she wasn't the right one for you anyways. Can we talk about something else? Yeah, sure. How much longer will you be making this noise for? I might invest in some earplugs. It's not that bad. Stop it! But tomorrow should be the last day. Well, let me just say I'm excited to finally get some peace. Well, I'm glad. Anyways, I'm gonna get back to work. Talk tomorrow maybe? Uh. Oh my god, it's getting louder by the minute. Sorry, I'll tone it down a bit. Oh my god! What is it that you are doing that is so important, but yet you can't tell me? Why do you need to know so bad? I don't need to know. I just wanna know. Because you are the only person making this type of noise in the complex. I'm surprised everyone isn't complaining about you. And I told you I'm almost done. After that, you won't need to hear from me again. Oh my. Alright, just finish up. It's 8:00. You have an hour. Okay. And gosh, turn off that music. Sounds like a screeching cat. What? No way you can listen to that! I have to. You don't understand. You're so annoying. Okay, Today is the day you told me you would be finished.

My girlfriend was so insane that she told everyone that we broke up because I cheated on her in her dream. She was a spoiled rich girl who came from a terrible snobby family. They were the kind of people who would wipe their butts with hundred dollar bills if they ran out of toilet paper. If she and I ever got into an argument, she would run back to her daddy who would send her on a week long vacation to Cancun just so she could recover from our arguments. And one of these week long vacations to Cancun, she ended up getting pregnant from one of the six hotel staff she cheated on me with. But when she came back, instead of telling me, she told me that she was breaking up with me because she had a dream in Mexico that I would cheat on her. At this point I was so over the relationship that I didn't care if it ended. After I moved out and moved back to my parents house, I got a call from an anonymous number. When I I picked up the phone, it was my ex girlfriend's father. He called to say you broke my baby girl's heart. Now I'm going to break your head. I'd sleep with one eye open if I were you. I told him whatever and for him and his crazy family to leave me alone. Truthfully, I was scared of him. I knew he had enough money to hire whoever he wanted to do whatever he wanted. When I applied for a new job, I noticed someone was watching me at the office. They weren't just watching me, they were staring. When I left the building, I saw them following behind. I started to look around, and that's when I saw a black van with two men inside it, also watching me. I've seen enough movies to know what that meant. I didn't waste any time. I started running as fast as I could. I ended up running into a park where I found a police officer. I alerted him and told him that I was being followed by three men. I thought that he would help me, but instead he told me to put my hands behind my back and that I was being arrested. I demanded that he tell me why I was being arrested, but he told me to shut my broke ass up. The second he called me broke, I realized that this was all my ex's father I was doing. He paid the cop off to arrest me. At this point, I didn't even fight back. The cop put me in his cop car, and just as I thought, he brought me to my ex girlfriend's estate. When he threw me out of the car, my girlfriend's father was waiting for me, sipping tea like a James Bond villain. I asked him if he was going To take my life away. And all he said was, we need to talk. I followed him inside and passed by my girlfriend, who was getting her feet done. Her father sat me down and there was trembling in his voice. My babe

I thought everyone heard the vacuum cleaner screaming when it turned on. For years. My parents told me I was being dramatic when I covered my ears during everyday stuff. Turns out I wasn't dramatic at all. When I was little, probably like 3 or 4, I'd always ask my mom why the T. V. Was so loud. She check the volume and it would be on like 15 which is pretty normal, but to me it sounded like someone was yelling in my ear. My parents thought I was just being a weird kid. As I got older, things got worse. I started wearing these chunky noise cancelling headphones to school assemblies because the microphone feedback made me wanna throw up. During fire drills I would literally hide under my desk crying because the alarm felt like someone was stabbing my eardrums with a fork. The school nurse started calling my parents saying I was having panic attacks during normal school activities. My mom took me to our family doctor when I was 8. He did the basic hearing test where you raise your hand when you hear the beep. My hearing was perfect so he said I probably had anxiety. That's when the real nightmare started. Every little sound became torture. The microwave beeping sounded like a fire truck Siren. When my dad would start his car in the garage, I could feel The engine vibrations in my chest, and it made me dizzy and sick. Stopped eating dinner with my family because the sound of forks scraping plates made me want to scream. My parents were getting frustrated with me. My mom would say stuff like, normal people don't get panic attacks from the dishwasher running. My dad thought I was making it up for attention. They sent me to a counselor who gave me breathing exercises and told me to download meditation apps. By the time I turned 14, I couldn't function anymore. I stopped riding in cars because the engine noise made me nauseous. Showers hurt my ears so bad, I could only take them for, like, two minutes. I couldn't go to restaurants because the sound of people talking mixed with plates clinking. Sounded like metal scraping against metal. One day during sophomore year, we had a fire drill, and I completely lost it. I collapsed in the hallway, sobbing and shaking. The sound was so overwhelming, I thought my head was going to explode. Three teachers had to carry me to the nurse's office. Most of my teachers thought I was being overdramatic, but my substitute science teacher, Mrs. Lopez

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning, after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day, I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy, and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was. One Afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

The first time I walked in on it I thought something was wrong. He looked at me all calm and said I'm just mentally preparing. I've never looked at showers the same way. 2. I found out men treat fridges like treasure hunts. He'll open it five times in a row, stare like something new is going to spawn, sigh dramatically, and then eat plain cheese straight from the block. I once asked why he keeps checking. He said in case a snack magically appears. Three I didn't know guys hum to themselves during the most random tasks. My boyfriend will be cleaning the sink, humming what sounds like boss battle music, then suddenly switch to singing about how this sponge is my sword. I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said but it still smells like me, so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6 point 10. They make sound effects for everything. Opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7. They'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8. They'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes, and apparently that's normal to them. 9. They'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car. Groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10. They can sit in total silence for an hour staring at the wall, and when you ask what they're thinking about, they say nothing. And somehow they really mean nothing.

I've been going to the same tattoo shop for about seven years and got work done every few months. My artist, Derek, was always really laid back and liked doing challenging pieces. He'd done my whole sleeve and my back piece and everything. You're basically my canvas at this point. He'd always joke, but this time I wanted to cover up my ex's name on my shoulder blade. I sat in his chair that Thursday afternoon and told him I wanted a black mandala over it. Derek nodded and said, easy next. I've done hundreds of these. He got the stencil ready and started setting up his machine. Everything seemed normal at first. He was talking about this new ink he'd gotten and asking about my new job and all that usual talk. The buzzing of the machine was almost relaxing. About two weeks later, though, something felt weird during the healing. I was checking it in the mirror, and the texture didn't feel right. I could feel raised bumps that spelled out letters when I ran my fingers over it. I went back to the shop that Saturday morning and showed Derek. He looked at it for maybe 10 seconds and then took a step back. His eyebrows went up, and he tilted his head to the side, staring at my shoulder blade. Let me get you in the chair under the light, he said, and his voice Was quieter than usual. He put on gloves and ran his fingers over the tattoo once, then again, then a third time. He kept tracing the same spots over and over, and then just stood there shaking his head. The name Nathan was rising through the black mandala in these raised ridges. They weren't scar or keloids, but actual raised ink pushing up through the new tattoo. Derek stepped back on the chair and asked, have you ever had any healing problems before? I told him, never. All my other tattoos healed totally flat. The ridges were only where the old name was, maybe half an inch tall for each letter, but they were really obvious and you could read. Made it through the black ink like rail. He called over the shop owner, Tony, who'd been tattooing for 35 years. Tony took one look and right away said, I need to know if you have any allergies or skin conditions. I told him, no, I was perfectly healthy. He started asking weird questions about whether the original tattoo was done somewhere sketchy, or if I'd had any reactions when I first got it. The thing was, I got the original at a good place three years ago. No problems at all when I got it. My skin had always healed great. These raised ridges made no sense. Derek kept touching it with his gloved fingers and tracing the letters. He said, in all his years and thousands of cover UPS. He'd never seen old ink push through new ink like this. Texture felt like hard plastic under the skin. Totally different from normal scar tissue. Derek was really confused and said, look, I think we should try going deeper with even thicker black. I figured, why not? Maybe it just needed more ink. He went deeper this time and really packed the ink in there. The whole shop was watching. Now other artists kept coming over between their clients because everyone wanted to see this weird thing happening with my skin. Someone said maybe it was the type of ink that was used originally, but Derek checked his records, and it was the same.

I've been keeping this notebook for six years, and my girlfriend had no clue until last week. She always said I never opened up emotionally, but honestly, I just thought guys weren't supposed to talk about all the little things they notice. Growing up, my dad forgot everyone's birthday. My mom couldn't remember who liked what food. Their fights were brutal because nobody paid attention to anyone. I swore I'd never be that type of boyfriend. So in college, I started writing stuff down about whoever I was dating. Not weird stalker stuff, just normal things. Like how Ashley preferred hot chocolate when it rained, but iced coffee when it was sunny. Or how Jessica's voice got higher when she was nervous about something. When I met Mia three years ago, the notebook got way more detailed. I wrote down everything. How she stirred her cereal exactly seven times before eating it. How she hummed the same tune when she was happy. How her left eyebrow twitched right before she'd start laughing at something. Every few weeks, I'd add new stuff, like how she only wore her lucky socks on job interview days. Or how she needed exactly eight minutes of silence when she got home from work before she could handle talking. I wrote down that she liked her apartment at exactly 72 degrees, not 71 or 73. That she always ordered extra pickles but never ate them. That she got cranky. If she didn't eat something by 11:00am, but never admitted she was hungry, the notebook helped me figure out when to give her space and when to push her to talk about stuff, when to play upbeat music, and when she needed something sad. I knew she was stressed when she started reorganizing her bookshelf, so I'd order her favorite Thai food before she even realized she was hungry. When she was upset, she'd clean the bathroom obsessively, so I'd run her a bath afterward. None of this felt calculated or weird to me. It just seemed like paying attention. But I never told her about it because it sounded super intense when I thought about explaining it. Like, hey, hey, babe, I've been documenting your behavior patterns for three years. Doesn't exactly sound romantic. Plus, guys don't really talk about this stuff with each other. I figured she'd think I was some kind of control freak or something. Last Tuesday, she was cleaning our home office while I was at work. She called me freaking out, asking why I had a notebook with her name on it hidden behind my desk. I panicked, thinking she'd found something embarrassing, but she said she hadn't opened it yet. She was waiting for me to get home to explain. The drive home felt like forever. I kept imagining her thinking I was documenting her flaws or planning to break up with her or something crazy. When I got there, she was sitting On the

Elliot leaned in so close our breaths mingled and asked, how do I get close to your best friend? Elliot was the kind of gorgeous that made girls walk into lockers, but he sat there looking genuinely lost. I've never been on a date, he admitted. I almost laughed because he'd had at least three Valentine's offers this year alone. You literally have girls throwing themselves at you, I said. He shrugged. Sure, but it's different when I'm the one doing the chasing. I just freeze. I want this proposal to go well. That's when I realised he wasn't playing dumb. He actually didn't understand. He was attractive enough to where planning a proposal wasn't even necessary. But then again, the girl he wanted to take was none other than the most beautiful, full, talented, intelligent girl in the school. My best friend, Bian, with green eyes and light brown hair and an acceptance letter to Yale. There was nothing missing from her. Elliot slid over a small envelope. Here's my bride. I almost started hyperventilating. Comic Con weekend tickets and a free hotel. Holy Mother of all! I shook his hand enthusiastically. Three weeks. I'll teach you everything in three weeks. First week we studied the basics. After school, I taught him to how give compliments without sounding like he was reading from a script. Notice the small things, I said. New earrings if she looks tired. If She changed her hair. He was clumsy at first. Great haircut. You look pretty beautiful. I burst into laughter while he glared back. Compliments aren't about the adjectives you use. It's the heart, the sound, the honesty. He nodded, then looked me in the eyes. I like the way your eyes get brighter when you talk about something you love. My face flushed as he grinned. That's good. I managed. Say that for Vianne. The practice continued, and by the end of the week he was a complimenting machine, and I was immune to his one liners. Well, almost immune. By week two we moved on to actual romancing. We met up for a picnic at a popular dating spot, became competitive at bowling, and hung out at his place to watch movies. In the evening we practiced slow dancing in the garage, stepping on each other's toes for fun. It's a pretty great. I don't know why I kept freezing up before, he said, spinning me around. That's because most people our age do way more on dates. I made kissy sounds in his ear, and he jumped back, staring daggers at me for teasing him. I grinned as he helped me back up. Let's practice slow dancing, too, he suggested, slipping his arms to my waist, carefully making the heart of my chest pound wildly. Is this okay? He breathed against my hair. I could barely breathe, let alone answer. The night before the proposal, I helped him Pick out his outfit and style his hair exactly the way beyond preferred. Do I look good? For a second I forgot how to speak. You're like a prince, I breathed, and quickly added, that's what Vianne would say. We did one final practice run in the park. He strung up fairy lights and held onto my hand, gently stroking the back of it with his thumb. I stared up at him, at the large brown eyes sprinkled with golden speckles from the fairy lights, and smiled. He leaned in slowly, but just as I closed my eyes, he paused, dropping my hands, and took a step back. Vianne's going to love this. Reality crashed back hard. My heart squeezed painfully while I forced myself to agree. I think you'll do perfectly, I reminded him. Comic con was the same weekend as prom. No, he said. Thanks for bullying me. I mean teaching me. He winked and pulled me into one last tight hug. Enjoy Comic Con. I squeezed back. Enjoy prom. That Friday, the whole school watched as Elliot approached Vian at lunch with flowers and a giant proposal sign. He executed everything perfectly, just like we'd practiced. Speech, the timing, even the way he held the flowers. Vianne squealed and said yes! While everyone filmed it. The cafeteria erupted in cheers while my heart broke into a million pieces. How could I have let myself fall for a guy who was clear from the start he wanted Vianne? Not me. Elliot's eyes found mine in the crowd for just a second before Vianne pulled him into a hug. I quickly wiped away tears and walked off. I left school early, claiming I felt sick, which was

My mom had me when she was just 13. She was a child herself, but she tried her best. I still remember the day my second grade teacher made us draw our families. Other kids drew stick figures of dads and siblings. I just drew mom. When I got home, Mrs. Peters had written incomplete assignment in red pen across the top. Mom looked at my drawing, then at the red Mark, without a word, she took a marker and drew a giant circle around me and her. This, he said, is a complete family. By middle school, I was a straight a student. Mom would tape my report cards to our fridge like trophies. She'd come home from double shifts at the diner, her uniform stained with grease and still help me with homework. Education is your ticket out, she'd say. Then Cassie Mitchell happened. She cornered me by the lockers surrounded by her friends. Hey, charity case. Is it true your mom was a pregnant middle schooler, but you don't even know who your dad is? They were right. I didn't. The whispers followed me everywhere. Trailer trash, they'd say just loud enough for me to hear. Your mom's a SLT. I started skipping school. When my straight A's turned to F's, school called. Mom took a rare day off from the diner. I expected her to be furious. We couldn't afford lost wages, but When she got home, she just sat beside me on our porch steps, still in her waitress uniform. What's happening, baby? She asked, her voice tired but gentle. I stared at the concrete. Those, it's at school, I finally whispered. They say I'm nothing but a mistake, that I ruined your life. Mom was quiet for so long, I thought she might have fallen asleep. Then she grabbed my shoulders, her eyes suddenly fierce. Listen to me, she said, her voice shaking. Everyone in this town expected me to fail to give you up. My own parents threw me out, but you're the best decision I ever made. She wiped her eyes. So tomorrow we're going to show them exactly what we're made of. The next morning, mom, transform.

After the school shooting at the nearby elementary school, three children were shot dead. One of them was 10 year old Amelia, who bled out in Miss Lee's arms. And two months later, she became my 8th grade history teacher. At first, she seemed normal, just wanted to keep us safe. She locked our door even during class, and memorized every parent's face. When the intercom crackled, she'd freeze for a second before continuing. But as winter turned to spring, Miss Lee's Protection shifted into something scary. In place of our usual classes, we had special safety games where we had to hide in assigned spots around the room as fast as possible. She timed us and said we needed to beat her old class's record. My spot was the coat closet, which felt too small, but Miss Lee swore it was the safest place. The closet saved someone once, she told me. Her eyes looked far away when she said it. The games were kind of fun until Miss Lee started staring at my friend Isabella during them. Isabella had brown hair and freckles, just like the girl in the newspaper photo. Sometimes Miss Lee would call Isabella Amelia, then look confused. I'd constantly hear her whisper, 22 new chances while counting us as more time passed. The more she talked about her old class and how she should have been harder on them. When they laughed during drills, we tried to Tell ourselves it was just part of the process. But I knew none of this was normal when she interrupted class one day to show us her lock screen. It was a photo of her old class. She pointed to each child and told us their names. When she got to Amelia, she started hysterically sobbing. She could barely speak, but even in that state, she made us memorize where Amelia sat and how she hid. Amelia was quiet, I remember her saying, but not quiet enough. From there, I was forced to watch as Miss Lee practically descended into madness. I could tell something terrible was coming. But nothing could have prepared me for that Friday in May. Miss Lee's hands shook so bad she dropped her coffee. She checked her phone constantly and whispered, next time I'll be better. To Amelia's photo. She made us practice hiding six times before 10:00, and her voice sounded strangled whenever she spoke. Today you show me you can survive, she said. Today you prove you're better than my old class. Those were the worst words she had ever said. She unlocked the side door, which was against every school rule. She told us this was our most important drill ever, as she positioned Isabella in the corner, exactly like in the old photos. We had to be perfect or we'd end up in a grave, just like Amelia, she warned us. At 10:00am, the hallway exploded with sound. Gunshots echoed off The walls making my ears ring, Miss Lee screamed.

At my daughter's soccer practice, Helen saw me walking towards her and held her phone to her ear. No one had even called her. Helen, what's going on? She mouth, sorry and walked faster. We used to complain about our husbands together. Parents were whispering and showing each other something on their phones. When I walked by, they quickly put them away. By Thursday, my daughter was refusing to go to school. I moved my desk away from everyone else. The teacher Said it was for space reasons, but there's like 10 feet between me and Leah now. I tried to bring her to the hairdresser to cheer her up, but when the woman saw me coming, she closed early. No apology. Just flipped the sign and pulled the blinds. My phone buzzed. It was my landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry, rent can wait this month. This was the same man who charged me a 50 dollar inconvenience fee when I paid rent at 12:00am instead of midnight. Then the birthday party, Emily's sleepover. My daughter found out that everyone was invited except her. She was having such a bad panic attack that I had to call a hospital. Mom, what did I do? Emily is my best friend. Enough was enough. I called the school office. Something is happening to my daughter. She's being systematically excluded and I need answers right now. The counselor called back within an hour, but her voice was off, like she was choosing every word carefully. Missus Callahan, we just wanted to check in about your home environment. Is everything safe? Anyone new spending time around your daughter? What? What are you even asking me? I think it's best if we discuss this in person. Can you, you come in tomorrow morning? No. You'll tell me right now why my daughter is being tortured. Long pause. The principal will explain everything tomorrow. Beep. She hung up. Then at eleven PM, an email from my gym. Membership terminated effective immediately. I've been going there for five years. The owner knew me by name. I was trying to figure out what to do when my daughter crawled into my bed at 2:00am sobbing, Mommy, am I ugly? It took everything in me not to burst into tears. The lunch lady wouldn't look at me today. She just pointed at my tray. I finally caved Saturday morning. I found myself walking towards the principal's office while being escorted by a security guard. Other parents there for Saturday sports held their kids against the walls as we passed. One mom literally shielded her son with her body like we were dangerous. In his office, the principal locked the door behind us. The click was so loud in the silence, he walked to the windows and twisted the blinds shut. My daughter grabbed my hand tighter. Please sit down. I'll stand. What is this about? He sat at his desk, fingers hovering over his keyboard, then pulled them back. Mister Griffin, you're scaring me. Missus Callahan, he was looking at his screen, not at me. When did you last speak to your ex husband? Christmas. Why? And you haven't been in contact since then? No communication at all? No. We exchanged texts about.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curveball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and, and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor role. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three Years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place.

So I fucked his grandpa. Now, before you call me crazy, stay right there or I'll suck your balls one by one. A simple joke, a meme repeated 1,000 times by fucking kids on the internet. But when he threw it in my face, I felt a crack open inside me, as if behind that laughter there was icy contempt, a refusal to take me seriously. He thought I'd laugh with him, but hell, nah. So I chose to tear away from him what he thought was untouchable, his grandfather. The old man was guilty of nothing except existing in his lineage and having this little bastard with him. His wrinkled skin, his fragile breath, he embodied innocence. And that's precisely what made my act more cruel. I took it, I destroyed it, piece by piece, until only a suffocating silence remained. And then the unthinkable happened. Like a curse born of my actions, his body began to swell, to swell with an alien life. The grandfather, despite his age, now carried within him an impossible pregnancy, an abomination, a cursed child conceived in pain and despair. When his grandson discovered what was happening, his eyes filled with horror. I looked him straight in the eyes and whispered, did you wanna laugh? Look, now your grandfather carries within him the proof of my vengeance. And that laughter will haunt you until your death. That day, he understood that some jokes are worth more than a Smile. They breed monsters.

My brother Jake, has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the center of attention for 5 minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance, Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day, the one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding, I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up, he said. And I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I, I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself and I just can't deal with that stress on my wedding day. The line went quiet for like 10 seconds and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now you're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. She's basically family. I. Tried to explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice. Hope think he changed his mind? He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, he says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted like 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewelry. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today with a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. He's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done and I have to deal with.

My brother Ryan was marrying this absolute nightmare of a woman named Brianna. Nobody in our family could stand her, but Ryan was completely blind to it. She was controlling from day one. She told my mom she couldn't wear navy to the wedding because that was her colour. She demanded our family pay for all the flowers, which cost like $3,000. I asked if I could bring my two kids to the wedding. She said absolutely not because children would ruin her perfect day. But the worst part was when we found out she hadn't even sent an invitation to our grandma Helen. When my mom asked why, Brianna just shrugged and said grandma was boring and would probably fall asleep during the ceremony anyway. I was furious. Grandma Helen was 82 and had basically raised Ryan after our dad died. She taught him how to drive, helped him with homework every night, and even paid for his college textbooks when money was tight. When grandma found out she wasn't invited, she didn't yell or cry like I expected. She just sat quietly in her kitchen chair, nodding slowly. Then she looked up at me with this calm smile and said, well, we'll see about that, won't we? The wedding day came and I was dreading every minute of it. The venue was actually this gorgeous old mansion that had been in our family for decades. Grandma had let Ryan use it for free because she wanted his wedding to be special. I was standing there watching Brianna boss around the photographers when suddenly I heard gasps from the guests. There was Grandma Helen walking up the main entrance in the most stunning gold gown I'd ever seen. She looks like royalty. She was carrying this leather folder under her arm and had the biggest smile on her face. Brianna spotted her immediately and marched over, her face turning bright red. What are you doing here? You weren't invited, Brianna screamed loud enough for everyone to hear. The entire wedding party stopped what they were doing to watch. Grandma didn't even.

Allison couldn't let anyone else have their moment. At our cousin Jamie's beach wedding, she grabbed the mic during toasts to announce her divorce. During our cousin Alex's first dance, she loudly told everyone at our table she was pregnant. At my best friend's reception, she stood on a chair during the cutting to reveal she was moving to Paris. That moment of chaos at her reception was nothing compared to what awaited me three months later at my wedding. Everything was going perfectly until the speeches started. My maid of honor was halfway through her beautiful toast when Allison stood up. She clinked her glass dramatically and walked to the front. She took the microphone right out of my friend's hand. Sorry, but I have something important to share while everyone's here, she announced. She pulled her boyfriend, Craig, up beside her. She told the entire room they were adopting a baby from Korea. My guests erupted in confused congratulations while my maid of honor stood there holding her speech cards uselessly. The rest of my reception became the Allison show. People kept coming up to her for details about the adoption. Someone started a collection for baby supplies using the envelope box meant for our cards. The photographer spent 20 minutes doing an impromptu photo shoot of her and Craig. My mom found me crying in the bathroom and told me I was being dramatic. She's just excited about becoming a mother, she said. You should be happy for family. My aunt agreed that Allison was just enthusiastic about sharing good news. A few months later, at Sunday dinner, Allison announced her wedding date. She went on and on about her vintage Hollywood glamour theme. She'd already booked the historic Grandview Manor downtown. Frank sat there nodding while she showed everyone her Pinterest boards. I want it to be absolutely perfect, she gushed. No interruptions or distractions. Just all eyes on us for once. The irony nearly choked me, but I smiled and said it sounded lovely. That night, I started planning. Allison's fatal flaw was her complete blindness to her own behavior. She genuinely believed she was just sharing joy. She couldn't understand why anyone would mind. She also had zero ability to handle competition for attention. I reached out to my college theater friends first. My roommate Macy ran an improv group that specialized in flash mobs and public performances. When I explained my idea, she literally cackled with delight. Within a week, I had 12 performers committed to the cause. The tricky part was getting them into the wedding. I studied Allison's guest list when she left it at my mom's house. Several couples had generic plus one RSVPs. Macy's performers could pose as dates for single guests. I knew. I reached out to these friends and explained the situation. Every single one wanted to help. After hearing About my wedding the wedding was as over the top as expected. Allison had seven bridesmaids and released doves during the ceremony. The reception ballroom dripped with crystals and white roses. My performers were scattered perfectly throughout the room as planned. Guests everything started during dinner service. At exactly 6:30, Macy stood up at table 4 and let out a shriek. Her fake boyfriend was on one knee between the salad and soup courses. The whole room turned to watch as she said yes. He slipped a costume jewelry ring on her finger. Allison's smile froze, but she started clapping along with everyone else. At 6:45 during the champagne toast.

For as long as I could remember, my younger brother Garrett had been insecure about being weak and scrawny. The LaCrosse team would shove him into lockers daily, calling him twig boy. The worst was when he couldn't open a water bottle at lunch and his crush Emily laughed, asking the guy next to her, Garrett's too weak. He needs a man to help him. I always felt bad for him. But the day he discovered one punch man, everything changed. He burst into my room holding his phone, showing me Saitama's transformation. Look, he was just like me. A weak, bullied nobody. Then he did the simple training and became the strongest hero alive. I was just happy he found something that gave him hope. The very next morning, Garrett started Saitama's routine religiously. 100 push UPS, 100 sit UPS, 100 squats, a 10 kilometer run every single day. Within two months, his arms showed actual definition and his chest filled out his shirts. The LaCrosse team stopped shoving him around completely, while mom bought him protein powder and dad installed a pull up bar. Look at my dedicated boy, she'd beam at dinner. When he shaved his head bald, the school counselor pulled me aside. Whatever is motivating him, it's working. His grades are up, confidence through the roof. Even I was impressed when he bench pressed his body. Wait. For the first time. The best part was Emily Starting to notice watching him do pull UPS after school and asking about his anime workout, he'd flex and quote, Sidima, I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun. We all laughed because he was finally becoming the person he wanted to be. But as months passed, things shifted when Garrett demanded everyone call him Sidima. Refusing to respond to Garrett anymore, teachers got email signed Sidima, while he begged mom to legally change his name. When you're 18, she said, this is just a phase. Soon after, he quit soccer. Because Sidima trained alone, and his knuckles stayed permanently stabbed. From concrete walls in our basement. I'm removing my limiters, he explained, wrapping them in bloody gauze. Now deadlifting 300 pounds, his frame had exploded from 130 to 200 pounds of pure muscle, with veins sneaking up his arms like cables. When I tried talking to him about my concerns, he brushed me off. You're getting too intense about this whole point is to push past human limits. He showed me his training journal, filled with detailed power rankings, strength measurements, and notes about breaking through, with page after page of sidemen quotes highlighted in yellow. After he passed out doing squats, mom attempted an intervention. Honey, you need rest days. Tama never rested. That's why he transcended. He stormed out to run his 10 kilometer run at midnight. Then the mall incident started a week later, when he began picking fights, asking random guys to test his Power level until security banned him after the third confrontation. His fist now bore a tattoo reading one punch in bold letters across the knuckles. Six months into his transformation, Garrett looked like a bodybuilder who'd swallowed another bodybuilder. At 220 pounds of carved muscle with shoulders so wide he turned sideways through doorways. We were driving to get groceries on a normal Tuesday morning when he saw a cop conducting a routine traffic stop on the shoulder. Pull over, he said with deadly calm in his voice. What? No, we need to pull over. He grabbed the wheel. This is it, my moment. I pulled over with shaking hands as he got out and walked toward the officer with purpose. The cop immediately tensed with his hand moving to his whole

In my family, we had something called Health Day. Every Saturday morning at 9:00am sharp, we'd finish breakfast and dad would already have the basement ready with his white coat on and all his medical equipment laid out on metal trays in the basement. Our mom would kiss our foreheads before sending us down one by one. Then came the examinations. Thorough inspections of every inch of our bodies while he muttered medical terms and scribbled in thick blue binders. He'd make us stand naked under the bright lights while he circled us slow, his gloved fingers pressing into our skin, checking what he called abnormalities. He called it preventative care. I dreaded it. Every single week. The rule was you couldn't flinch or complain or you'd start over from the beginning. The strangest part? We weren't allowed to mention health day at school. Not to teachers, not to friends. I only realised in middle school how weird that was. How other kids just went to pediatricians once a year, not secret basement clinics every week. But the worst part was the special examinations. If dad found something concerning during the regular check, you'd get called down. On week nights, he had this small locked room with bright lights and an exam table with stirrups. The metal was always cold and he'd spend what felt like hours with his instruments, documenting every detail while telling us to relax and breathe. He said it Was for comprehensive assessment. The kid. I was terrified. I'd count the ceiling tiles over and over. But dad said fear meant you were taking your health seriously. When I got older, I started questioning everything. Why did we need weekly exams when no one else did? Why did mom drink before every health day? I remember once, at 14, I asked if I could skip it for Rachel's sleepover. Dad gripped my wrist and stared at me with these desperate eyes. Health Day is the only thing keeping you safe, he said. That's when I knew something was deeply wrong. Rachel's family had annual checkups, vaccinations, schedules, growth charts on the fridge. No basement procedures, no locked rooms, no binders documenting their bodies. Just normal healthcare. I finally refused to go downstairs when I turned 16. Dad went ballistic, screaming that I was ungrateful and didn't understand the dangers. Mom just stood there shaking. He locked me in my room and said I couldn't leave until I submitted to a full examination the next morning. Mom slipped me $20 under the door and whispered to use the window. When I came back that night, dad acted like nothing had happened. He just asked if I was ready for my examination, like he hadn't imprisoned me the night before. That's when I started planning. Still, the whole thing ate at me. Why was dad so obsessed with our health when he wasn't even a doctor? Where did he get all That equipment. Three months later, I told my health teacher everything. Missus Patterson kept her face very still as I explained our Saturday routine. She said she needed to make a phone call. I knew what that meant. She came back with the principal. Then the police came. Then child services. They took us out of class one by one. Just like health day. Except this time, we didn't go home. I'll never forget Dad's face when they arrested him. Not angry, just broken. I was protecting them, he kept saying. The officers found the binders. Dozens

The whole family rallied around her and my brother Jake, bringing casseroles and giving them space to grieve. But then she started acting like she was the only person who'd ever lost a baby. Started small at family dinners, she'd make comments about how nobody understood what real loss felt like. When my cousin Amanda talked about her dog dying, Kelly rolled her eyes and said that's not the same thing at all. When my mom mentioned missing my grandpa who died last year, Kelly literally scoffed and said, you got to say goodbye to him. Though the worst part was how she treated me. I've been married to my husband Chris for eight years and we don't have kids yet. Kelly started making these passive aggressive comments about how lucky I was to not have to worry about these things, how I couldn't possibly understand what she was going through. Last weekend was my nephew's birthday party. Kelly seemed okay during most of it, playing with the kids and laughing at their jokes. But then my brother's friend brought up how his wife was pregnant and Kelly's whole mood shifted. She got quiet and started picking out her food. Later when we were in the kitchen cleaning up, Kelly started talking about how Hard it was seeing pregnant women everywhere. I tried to be supportive, telling her I understood how triggering that must be. That's when she snapped. No, you don't understand, she said, her voice getting louder. You have no idea what it's like to lose a baby. You've never even been pregnant. You don't know what real loss feels like. Something inside me just broke. I've been holding this in for years, keeping it private because Chris and I decided we didn't want the.

I hated the idea of my 17 year old daughter dating anyone. But when she brought home this boy named Pete, I lost it. He had a motorcycle, tattoos, and that smug smile that made me want to run his name through the system. I made it my mission to break them up. I'd randomly show up at places they hung out, flash my badge around, and remind Pete that I knew how to make bodies disappear. But this kid never flinched. He just smile and say, have a good day, sir. When he came for dinner the first time, I placed my gun on the table next to my plate. My wife kicked me under the table, but I didn't care. Pete just looked at it and said, nice Glock 19, sir. My uncle's got the same one at his security firm. That's when the real torture began. I started making him come over every weekend to bond. I'd have him help me with the most backbreaking chores I could think of. Reshingling the roof in July, digging out a tree stump by hand, moving every piece of furniture in the house to steam clean the carpets. This kid never complained. He'd show up at 7:00am sharp, already wearing work clothes. Even brought his own work gloves. When I try to wear him down with endless tasks, he just say, what's next, Sir, one Saturday I had him helping me rebuild the deck. I was being extra harsh, making him redo boards that were perfectly fine. Around noon, my daughter brought us water. As she walked away, I caught Pete watching her. But it wasn't the way most teenage boys looked at girls. He had this soft smile, like he was watching something precious. I decided to test him. You know she's way out of your league, right? He wiped his forehead and said, oh, I know, sir. Trust me, I know. That's why I'm here every weekend, letting you test me. Cause she's worth it.

I used to work as a prison guard and one day our warden decided it would be a good idea to bring his 10 year old daughter in so she could see where dad works. He left her alone in his office for just a minute. When she wandered out, he found her 10 minutes later in one of the corridors bleeding out from her head with the fly on her pants undone. Watching him clutch her against his chest and hold her lifeless body repeating daddy's got you, sweetheart for hours was a sight I'll never forget. From that moment on, he became obsessed with finding out who did this. He didn't even take a day off from work, just came in next morning off, no sleep, spent the whole day grilling every prisoner in guard. He offered bribes, reduce sentences, special privileges, anything for information. I remember watching him break down between interviews then slam his head into the wall repeatedly just so the physical pain could momentarily drown out the emotional one for long enough to conduct the next interview. He grounded everybody he thought gave suspicious answers and threatened them with solitary confinement, beatings, firings for guards. He even went as far as forcing a prisoner to wear a wire during yard to hopefully catch an admission, threatening that prisoner with an extra two years to his sentence if he didn't wear it. Unfortunately, his interviews didn't get him an Answer, so he started becoming more harsh. Two and a half weeks after the death, he came into work hammered and grabbed me by the shoulders, telling me today was the beginning of the end. He then rounded up all the prisoners and announced to them that until the truth about who did it comes out, they would only be getting fed every second day. The backlash was brutal and the warden took that as a sign that the people protesting were guilty, got a hold of everyone who stepped out of line and ordered us, the guards, to beat them. Some guards, including myself, felt bad and didn't want to. But he threatened our jobs, saying if we're hesitating, then that means one of us must have called his daughter. He'd pace her.

So I drove him straight into another state while he slept. Mr Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper, just throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he'd always had his favorite line. In the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into driver's ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my, it dropped like a stone. Where do I turn, I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise, though with your steering. Straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchange looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight with you girls. Never know when we're Gonna stop or if we're gonna stop. By the third lesson we discovered his pattern. He'd make his nasty jokes for 20 minutes then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practice highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed. He's when I've beard slightly, I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife if we survive today's lesson. That is 3 teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon Sophia slightly veered and he exploded. Jesus, are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high and why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My 5 year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I and then he was snoring head tilted back against the headrest, looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realized he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up on the right And I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five North hanging over the highway. Like a dare, I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering. I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added, me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank, then back at the sleeping Mister Maya. And as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. Thirty minutes passed, then an hour and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up constantly with white.

Um, these are the regular AirPods Pro. She held them like they were defective. I specifically said I need the AirPods Pro Max. Everyone at school has the Max version now. These make me look poor. The Max version. This kid wanted the $600 over ear headphones that cost more than my car payment. Her music career consisted of making 15 second TikTok dance videos to trending songs. The Pro version has the same sound quality, I explained, trying to salvage the moment. These are what actual musicians use for professional work. Mom, nobody cares about sound quality. It's about the look. These tiny earbuds are so basic. The max ones are a statement piece. She was already putting them back in the box. Can you just return these and get the right ones? It's only like 300 bucks more. Only 300 bucks more. Like I was made of money. That's stung deep. I'd specifically researched which model music professionals recommended. I'd read reviews, compared Features even asked my friend who works in audio production. I'll think about it, I said quietly, taking the box from her. She was already back on her phone. Thanks, mom. You're the best. Make sure you get the space gray ones, not silver. Silver looks cheap on camera. I just nodded and walked away. Next day, I'm at Apple Store standing in the return line, still feeling terrible about the whole situation. The line was moving slowly and I could hear the customer service conversation happening ahead of me. I'm sorry, ma'am, your card was declined again. Do you want to try a different payment method? I looked up from my phone. A woman about my age wearing scrubs with Maria embroidered on them was standing there with her teenage son. He couldn't have been older than 15, wearing a faded band T-shirt and holding her hand supportively. Um, let me try this one, Maria said, pulling out a different card. Her hands were shaking slightly. Sorry, Miguel. I thought I had enough after paying rent. This one declined too, the employee said gently. The boy immediately stepped forward. It's okay, mom. I don't really need new earbuds for school. My old ones still work fine for online classes. Maria's shoulders sagged like someone had just crushed her dreams. Miho, you've been using those broken earbuds for two years. The left one doesn't even work anymore. And you need them for your virtual music lessons. Maybe next month I'll Have better tips from work, she said, her voice cracking. Your music teacher said you have real talent. You deserve proper equipment. Mom, sharing one earbud with my study group is fine. Besides, my music sounds better when we listen to.

I paid for this so I'm keeping it moment. My ex wife Emma thought she was so clever during our divorce. We've been married eight years and when things went south, she hired this shark lawyer who promised to take me for everything I had. The divorce was brutal. She wanted the house, both cars, half my business and spousal support. Her lawyer kept saying I was hiding assets and demanded access to all my financial records going back five years. But there was one thing Emma really wanted, my signed Jersey collection. I've been collecting them since high school. Mickey Mantle, Joe Montana, Michael Jordan, worth about $30,000 total. Emma hated that collection, always called it my stupid sports shrine and said it was a waste of money. But now that we were splitting up, suddenly she wanted half of everything, including jerseys she'd mocked for years. Her lawyer argued that since we bought some of them during the marriage, she was entitled to 50% of the collection. The Mickey Mantle alone was worth 12 grand. I tried explaining that most of these were gifts for my dad or things I'd saved up for with my own money before we even met. Didn't matter. Her lawyer wanted receipts for everything. So I spent weeks digging through old boxes, finding every receipt, every certificate of authenticity, every piece of paper that proved when and how I got each Jersey. That's when I found something interesting, the Michael Jordan Jersey, the crown jewel of my collection, worth $15,000. I had the original receipt from 2019, but it wasn't purchased by me. It was purchased by Emma as a surprise for my 40th birthday. She'd spent months tracking it down through collectors, paid full price, even had it professionally framed. I'll never forget her face when my lawyer presented that receipt in court. She went completely white as he explained that according to her own legal argument, she just proved the most valuable item in my collection legally belonged to her. Her lawyer tried to backtrack, saying it was a gift and gifts don't count. But my lawyer was ready. He pulled out the divorce papers where Emma's team had specifically argued that the source of payment determined ownership, not the intent. The judge looked annoyed. He asked Emma's lawyer if they wanted to change their legal strategy, which would mean starting the entire asset division process over again. That would cost them another six months and 20,000 in legal fees. Emma was trapped by her own greed. If she backed down, she'd lose her claim to everything else. If she pushed forward, she'd have to give me the Jordan Jersey. While fighting for jerseys worth half as much, her lawyer whispered something in her ear. She shook her head violently. They whispered more. Finally, she slumped back in her chair, looking defeated. Fine, she said through gritted teeth. He can keep his stupid jerseys. But I wasn't done. I Stood up and addressed the judge directly. I'd like to make a counter offer regarding the Michael Jordan Jersey. Everyone looked confused. My own lawyer didn't know what I was planning. According to the receipt, my ex wife purchased this Jersey. According to her legal argument, that makes it hers. I don't want to take something that doesn't belong to me. Emma's eyes lit up. She thought I was giving her a 15 thousand dollar dollar victory. However, I continued. I'd like to.

Um, okay, well, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to forgive you, but obviously, like you said, I guess she didn't tell you. This is not necessarily your fault. I'm sure I hope that you wouldn't go Out of your way to sleep with a married man. But if you said that you don't know that he's married, I guess I don't really have any choice to believe you. So.

I was 12 when a man in a blue pickup truck pulled up next to me while I was walking home from school. He asked if I wanted to earn $20 helping him move boxes. My parents had always warned me about strangers, but $20 seems like a fortune to a kid who got $5 allowance. The moment I got in his truck, I knew I'd made a terrible mistake. He immediately locked the doors and started driving in the opposite direction of where he said we were going. When I asked where we were headed, he told me to shut up and sit still. He drove for what felt like hours to a small cabin in the woods. No neighbours, no cell towers, nothing but trees. He dragged me inside and tied me to a chair and what looked like a basement. The smell was awful, like something had died down there. For the first two days, he barely spoke to me except to bring stale bread and warm water. I cried constantly, begging him to let me go home. He just stared at me with these cold, empty eyes and said my parents probably hadn't even noticed I was gone yet. On the third day, he made a mistake. He left his phone on the table while he went upstairs to make himself lunch. I, I could hear him moving around in the kitchen above me, the rope around my Wrists had loosened slightly from struggling and I managed to work one hand free. I grabbed his phone and called the first number I could think of, my mom's work number that she'd made me memorize for emergencies. When she answered, I whispered as quietly as I could, mom, I've been kidnapped. I'm in a cabin somewhere. There are tall pine trees everywhere and I can hear a train in the distance. Before I could say more, I heard his footsteps coming down the stairs. I quickly put the phone back and got my hand back in the rope just as he appeared. He looked at me suspiciously but didn't seem to notice anything different. What I didn't know was that my mom had immediately called the police. While staying on the line, they traced the call and started searching for cabins near train tracks in our area. Meanwhile, she kept calling his phone every few minutes, hoping I'd answer. The next morning, he seemed agitated, kept looking out the windows and pacing around the cabin. I realised later that police helicopters had been circling the area, getting closer to finding us. He started talking about moving me somewhere else, which terrified me. That afternoon, he went outside to load something into his truck. I heard him talking to someone on the phone, getting angry. While he was distracted, I noticed he'd left the basement door unlocked. This was my chance. I quietly climbed the stairs and saw him through The window still arguing on the phone by his truck. The front door was about 15 feet away. I knew I had to be smart about this. If I ran straight out, he'd see me immediately. Instead, I crawled on my hands and knees toward the back of the cabin. There was a small window near the floor that looks like it might be big enough for me to squeeze through. I managed to push it open and wiggle through, scraping my arms and legs on the frame. Once outside, I ran as fast as I could toward the sound of the train tracks. I figured if I could reach them, I might find help or at least know which direction LED back to civilization. My legs felt like jelly from being tied up for days, but pure adrenaline kept me moving. After running for about 10 minutes, I heard dogs barking in the distance. Then I heard voices calling my name. It was the search and rescue team my mom had called in. I screamed as loud as I could and kept running toward the voices. A police officer.

Last summer I got a text welcoming me to basketball dads 2023. Someone named Greg added me saying practice was Tuesdays at 6 and I needed to bring orange slices next week. I don't have kids, I'm not even that into sports, but I had just moved to a new city where I knew absolutely no one and something about being included felt nice so I just replied. Got it, thanks! Chat was surprisingly active. These dads were serious about their 8 year olds basketball league. They discussed zone defense strategies, complained about referee calls, and debated the merits of different sports drinks. I Learned that Coach Tim was too soft on the kids, that Brandon's dad never volunteered for anything, but always criticized that Kevin's son had real potential if he'd just focus more. When it came time for my orange slices, I panicked. Couldn't show up at a random children's basketball practice, so I texted that my car broke down but I'd Venmo someone for the snacks. Dave immediately replied no worries man, we got you. Car troubles are the worst. I sent $15 to Dave and felt strangely good about it. These guys were nice. Weeks passed, became invested in the team's progress. They lost to the Eagles by two points and I found myself genuinely disappointed. I celebrated when little Marcus finally made a basket after trying all season. Greg texted everyone about an end of Season Celebration at his house. All dads expect to attend. I considered coming clean, but by then I've been in the chat for two months. It would be weird to admit I wasn't actually part of their community, so I ghosted, ignored the invitation and subsequent messages asking if I was coming. The chat gradually slowed as the season ended. I figured that was it until three months later when my phone buzzed. Basketball Dads 2,023 has been renamed Soccer Dads fall 2,023 Greg alright, dad adds new season, new sport. Practice starts next Thursday. Dave my Tyler has never played soccer before. Any tips? Mike just buy good shin guards. Remember when Danny got bruised last year? They were back, and somehow so was I. This time I participated more, offering encouragement after games and soccer advice. I quickly researched on YouTube. The group needed a substitute. I nearly had a heart attack. Luckily, Brandon's dad finally volunteered for something. The team scheduled photo day and Greg sent a message. Need to confirm which kid belongs to 5 1 6 5 5 5 5 8 2 4 1 for the roster. That was my number. I froze. After eight months of being a phantom soccer dad, I had no choice but to confess. Guys, I need to tell you something. I don't actually have a kid on the team. I was added by mistake last year and just never left. Sorry for the weird deception. The chat went silent. For a full day. Greg finally

After watching my dad hit my mom for years, I finally hit him back and ended up in a psych ward. They classified me as violent. So I spent 7 months in a white room with nothing but my thoughts. When I was finally released, all I wanted was a family of my own, one built on love, not fear. That's how I met Noah. He was 6, living in a group home after being removed from his fourth foster placement. The social worker warned me he was challenging, code for traumatized. But when I saw him sitting alone, methodically lining up broken crayons by size, something in my heart cracked open. I sat down beside him and asked what he was drawing. Without looking up, he said a house with no yelling. I noticed burn marks on his arms, perfectly circular cigarette burns. I had similar scars, only mine were from my dad's cigars. The first few weeks were rough. Noah tested every boundary, waiting for me to snap. He'd break things, scream that he hated me, try to run away. But I never raised my voice, never threatened, never hit. Instead, I'd sit with him during his meltdowns, speaking softly until his breathing steadied. One night, I found him in the kitchen at 3 a. M. Stuffing cereal into his pockets. I'm not mad, I said, keeping my distance. But can you tell me why his voice was barely A whisper in case you change your mind about me. Like everyone else, I opened the pantry, showing him the extra shelves I'd installed. This is your food, too. You'll never go hungry here, I promise. Slowly, things improved. He started sleeping through the night, stopped hoarding food, called me dad for the first time after I spent hours helping him build a blanket fort. Then he showed up at our door claiming he changed, found god wanted his son. Noah hid under his bed when he heard that voice, shaking so hard the frame rattled. The custody battle was brutal. His father had family money, hired expensive lawyers. They painted me as unstable because of my psych ward. Stay said a single man couldn't properly raise a traumatized child. But Noah's therapist testified about his progress. His teachers described his transformation from a silent, scared kid to an engaged student who helped younger children. The judge listened. The final hearing was yesterday. Noah squeezed my hand so tight it hurt as his father made one last plea. Then the judge looked at Noah and asked what he wanted. He stood up straight, looked his birth father in the eye and said, I already have a dad, the kind who builds forts and doesn't hurt people. Walking out of that courthouse, adoption papers finally signed no. It turned to me, can we get ice cream? Of course, buddy. Dad. Those other foster homes, they said I was too broken. That No one would want to keep me. I knelt down, meeting his eyes. You were never broken. You were waiting for someone who understood. At night, I heard him crying in his room. When I checked on him, he was organizing his crayons again. But this time, he was drawing our house with both of us inside, smiling. See, he said, pointing, no yelling. Now, whenever Noah has a hard day, we build a fort.

I care about my teenage boy, but I'd be dishonest if I said I wasn't let down by the kind of person he's becoming. My son began getting into this different look back when he was in middle school. At first, he just wore black clothes. But once he got to high school, he's gone way too far with his strange style and I really don't like it. My wife doesn't seem to mind, but she's a pretty passive woman and has never been a very strict parent like me. If I were to describe how my son dresses now, he wears big, baggy black clothing and lots of chains and rings. At one point, he was even dying coloured strips into his hair. I remember being so upset the first day I saw this. It was just so embarrassing to see my child walking around like that. Now, I don't have a problem with gay people or anything like that, but I never really wanted that type of thing to be a part of my own household. I've never confronted my son about his sexuality, and I really just don't wanna know. If he does happen to be gay, our relationship is already sort of strained. And I feel like if I found out he wasn't straight, it would make it very hard for me to treat him the same like I Said I don't have a problem with gay people. I just don't wanna be shoved in my face on top of everything. Ever since my son entered high school, he's made friends with mostly girls. At first I was glad to see this and I was happy that my son still might have a chance of growing up into a real man's man. But as time went on, I realised that he wasn't in a relationship with any of these girls dad. They were all just his close friends. He constantly has his friends over the house and is part of a friend group with 3 other girls. To be fair, these girls have always been nothing but polite to me and my wife and are always respectful of our house. Still, it just rubs me the wrong way that my son doesn't seem to have any close guy friends and I feel like it's not good for him to grow up that way. I tried my best to be non judgmental towards my son, even though to me he looked like more of a freak of nature every day the more he kept leaning into his alternative fashion. I didn't understand it since all of his friends were normal girls, he was the only weirdo in his friend group who dressed like some 90s mall rat. When I look at him, he honestly reminds me of the kind of kids I would pick on in high school anyway about A year ago, I ran out of patience with him when he came home one day with his nails painted a shade of bright blue. My son had never done anything like this before and I couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly disgusted. I, I told him that he had gone too far with his emo bullshit and that I couldn't continue letting him make a fool out of himself like this. I told him that at one point he needed to become a man and painting his nails made him look like some sort of weak top. My son and I had never really been close. We didn't even speak that often. So he looked very hurt as I was telling him all this. But I couldn't help it. He had needed a reality check for so long and there was no avoiding this conversation. I told my son to go get nail polish remover and remove his nail polish right there in front of me. That's when he started to get angry and said that he didn't have to change himself just to appease my dumb, a homophobic son. My son has never spoken to either of his parents this way and I knew that there was no way I was letting him get away with it. I yelled at him for cursing at me like that and I told him that he would remove his nail polish immediately or there would be serious consequences. He said that there Was nothing worse I could do to him than continue being such a hateful father? And that's when I lost my shot. I told him that I would ground him for the entire year if he didn't remove his nail polish. Within the next 60 seconds, looked at me and told me that I could try, but I would never be able to control him and that he hated me. He ran up to his room after this and I followed through on my threat. I took his phone away and replaced it with a flip phone and he wasn't allowed to go out or have his friends over anymore. All he did after that for the rest of the year was call his friends in his room and completely ignore me. One night I overheard him crying to my wife about how much he hated his life since being grounded. But all she said was that I was his father and he needed to respect me. Proud of my wife for sticking up to me behind closed doors. And I still felt like I had made the right decision. I won't lie and say that it hasn't been a difficult year. My son stopped talking to me the day I grounded him and I honestly do miss him. He graduates next year and I just hope before then he'll realise that I was only ever trying to do what was best for him.

I need extra hands. Yeah, I don't think so. I wasn't about to climb into a bathroom stall with a freak. No, please. I think I might bleed out. Her voice was shaking, and suddenly this wasn't funny anymore. It was summer from my English class, a pregnant senior who everyone whispered about, but nobody really talked to. She was sitting on the toilet, gripping the handicap rail with white knuckles, and her face was covered in sweat. What's wrong? I asked, even though I was starting to guess. Please do something. I'm giving birth. She looked up at me with pure terror in her eyes. My whole body went cold. I was 17 and barely knew how tampons worked, let alone babies. But she was crying and alone, and I couldn't just leave her there. I hopped over the stall divider awkwardly and almost slipped on the wet floor. That's when I saw it. The baby was already crowning. There was blood on the toilet seat and the floor, and summer was making the low groaning sounds that scared me more than anything. This was actually happening in a gross school bathroom with fluorescent lights and graffiti on the walls. I'll be right back. I ran out of the bathroom, still in shock. I sprinted down the hallway to missus Bashar's classroom. She was my favourite teacher and The only adult I could think of who wouldn't freak out. I burst through her door, interrupting her lecture on photosynthesis. The whole class stared at me. I need your help urgently, please. I was out of breath and probably looked insane. Missus Bashar took one look at my face and followed me without asking questions. We ran back to the bathroom, and I could hear summer sounds getting louder. Other kids were starting to peek out of classrooms, wondering what was happening. Missus Bashar pushed open the stall door and immediately went into teacher mode. Okay, honey, I'm here. You're doing great. I'm going to support you while she gets the nurse. I didn't need to be told twice. I ran to the nurse's office faster than I'd ever run in PE. When I burst through the door, Nurse Patty was checking Casey's temperature. Casey, who everyone knew was Summer's boyfriend, the guy who'd been bragging about becoming a dad at prom. Summer's having her baby in the bathroom right now. I basically screamed it. Casey's face went from white to green. He threw up all over the floor before Nurse Patty could grab a trash can. But we didn't have time to deal with that. The three of us ran back to the bathroom, with Nurse Patty grabbing emergency supplies from her cabinet. By now, half the school had heard something was happening. Kids were crowding outside the bathroom door, trying to figure out what all the screaming Was about teachers were trying to move them back to class, but nobody was listening. When we got back to the stall, it was chaos. Missus Bashar was holding Summer's hand while she pushed. The nurse immediately took over, checking how dilated she was and telling summer to breathe. Casey stood frozen in the doorway, looking like he might pass out. That's when summer grabbed my hand and pulled me close. You have to get

So, listen, we're smack dab in the middle of one of our most popular games right now, and it's called The Naked Game. Now, I know you're probably freaking out, wondering how this works, so I'm gonna let my co host, Tiffany, explain the rules. Okay, so we have somebody you know very well on hold right now, and he claims that if we asked you the question, who was the last person to see you naked? That you would answer him. Right. And now, before we get your answer, what's on the line here? Buzz? Haha! Well, buddy, a romantic all inclusive getaway for two to Paradise Island Resort. Everything's paid for by us. Scotty the bus. This should be an easy question, Brooke. So here it goes. What is the name of the last person to see you naked? And you can't say yourself? Okay, this is really embarrassing. Well, remember, he just saw you naked. I mean, it doesn't mean anything happened, right? Right. So. Right, right, right. Who was the last person to see you naked? Okay, and you just need a first name or a last name, too? No, no, first name is fine, I guess, but if you can't remember their last names, like, how many people have You seen you naked this week? Okay, buzz, time to shut up over there. Um, okay, Brooke, we need an answer. The last person to see you naked was Austin. Austin? Oh, I'm sorry, that's not the day we were looking for. We actually had Lucas on the other line. Now this is awkward. Okay, no, that's not fair, cause it could have been Lucas. It could have been Lucas? Yeah, I'm wondering how many people have seen you naked. No, I mean, no, it was Lucas, but we didn't see each other. The lights were off in our room and. Yeah, so if you say like, who is the last person you were naked with? Then it would have been Lucas. Oh, so it wasn't Austin? No. And how do you think Austin feels about that? I, I don't know. Well, why don't you ask him? Cause he's listening right now. Yeah. Hey Brooke, so what happened to he's sleeping on the couch, I promise. I guess the couch turned into your bed then. Yeah, but nothing happened. But you just said you were naked with him. Okay, but you radio people need to stay the fuck out of this. That's probably what you should have told Lucas.

My family lived by one rule, you pay what you owe, no matter the cost. So when I was 19 and found out my father had borrowed 200,000 from the Koslov family, I knew our lives were over. My father sat at the kitchen table with his head in his hands while my mother paced and chain smoked. The deadline was three days away and we had nothing. Then Boris Koslov himself showed up at our door with his son, Nikolai. Boris looked at me the way you'd examine a car before buying it. He turned to my father and said, your debt disappears tonight if she marries my son. My father didn't even look at me before agreeing. My mother just lit another cigarette and stared at the wall. The wedding happened in Boris's basement. No dress, no flowers, just papers to sign and men with guns watching. Nikolai was 28 and had dead eyes. After the ceremony, he leaned close and whispered, your currency, nothing more. Remember that? The abuse started that first night. He showed me a room in his house with no windows and a lock on the outside. He said that's where I'd live if I caused problems. He monitored my phone calls and read my texts. If I took too long at the grocery store, he'd show up and drag me out by my arm. He'd remind me what his family did to people who betrayed them. How They made examples of entire bloodlines. He installed cameras in every room except the bathroom. When I showered, he'd bang on the door after exactly 10 minutes. He picked my clothes each morning and inspected me before we left the house. If my makeup wasn't right, he'd wipe it off roughly and reapply it himself. He weighed me every week and controlled my portions at meals. Every week we had dinner at Boris's house. I had to sit silent while they discussed their business like I wasn't there. Drug shipments, territory disputes, names of people who wouldn't be problems anymore. Nikolai would rest his hand on my knee under the table, squeezing harder if I showed any reaction. His mother would smile at me and say things like, such a good girl, knows her place. My parents called once a month to make sure I was being good. They never asked if I was happy or safe, just reminded me that my father's life depended on my cooperation. My younger sister wasn't allowed to talk to me because they didn't want her getting ideas. The breaking point came when Nikolai brought home another woman. He made me serve them dinner while they laughed and touched each other. When I dropped a plate, he backhanded me in front of her. She laughed and said, is this the debt payment? She's not even pretty. That night, while they were in our bedroom, I sat in the kitchen and realized I'd rather die. Trying to escape and live another day as property, I started planning carefully. I saved grocery money and tiny amounts and hid cash and tampon boxes. I memorized bus schedule and studied maps during my allowed library time. I smiled more, acted docile, made Nikolai believe I was finally broken. It took six months to save enough for a bus ticket to another state. I practiced walking with different postures in the bathroom mirror and studied accents on YouTube videos during my supervised internet time. You belong to us, I had said once. There's nowhere we won't find you. The night I ran, I left during his poker game when he'd be distracted for hours. I took nothing but the cash and clothes I could layer. I've been putting sleeping pills in his vodka for weeks, tiny amounts so he'd be groggy but not suspicious. At the bus station, I threw away my phone and bought a ticket with shaking hands. For 48 hours, I didn't sleep certain every stop would bring men with guns, which buses three times and doubled back twice to confuse anyone following. In a truck stop bathroom, I cut my hair with stolen Scissors and dyed it black with a box kit. I traded my coat with a homeless woman and bought men's clothes from a thrift store. By the time I reached my destination, I looked nothing like the girl who'd fled. I ended up in a small mountain town where I got a Job washing dishes under a fake name for two years. I jumped at every car door slam and every Russian accent. I moved constantly, never made friends, worked jobs that paid cash. I Learned to spot surveillance, bury my roots and keep emergency bags packed. One day.

What did you learn? When Nathan took me to his family's mansion for the first time, I knew I didn't belong. The driveway was longer than my entire street and their garage held more cars than my apartment building's parking lot. I was a waitress putting myself through nursing school and he was the heir to a real estate empire. I tried hiding my background. At first. I'd make excuses not to go to fancy restaurants, saying I wasn't hungry or had already eaten. When he bought me designer bags, I'd return them secretly and use the money for textbooks. I even practiced using the right forks at dinner by watching YouTube videos late at night. But Nathan wasn't like his family. He drove a beat up Volkswagen and wore the same three hoodies on rotation. When he found out I was returning his gifts, he started buying me practical things instead, grocery store gift cards, gas money, nursing scrubs. Never made me feel small. His mother, Andrea, was different. She'd ask questions like, what country club did your family belong to? Or which prep school did you attend? When I admitted I went to public school, she'd purse her lips and change the subject. Once she accidentally spilled red wine on my only nice dress at a family dinner. Things got worse when Nathan proposed. Andrea cornered me in the kitchen during our engagement party. How much, she asked, pulling out her checkbook. Name your price to walk away. You clearly only want his money. I was hurt but stood my ground. I love your son. I'm not going anywhere. Two weeks later, she showed up at the diner where I worked, ordering coffee and staying for my entire shift. She left religious pamphlets about marrying within your class with her 10 cent tip. My hands shook so bad I dropped three plates that day. Then came the custody battle. Nathan's cousin Amy had lost her kids to social services after a drug relapse. She was rich, well connected and desperate to adopt, but no agency would approve her with her history. That's when she found Tommy. Tommy was a sweet six year old boy from my old neighborhood. Mom was my regular at the diner, a single mother working three jobs. When she got sick with cancer, she asked me to help find Tommy a good home. I promised I would. Nathan and I applied to adopt Tommy. We had a stable home, good jobs. I'd finish nursing school by then and so much love to give. The social worker loved us. Tommy would come for weekend visits and we'd build blanket forts and make homemade pizzas together. But Andrea and Amy had other plans, hired expensive lawyers claiming we were financially unstable. They dug up my father's old Duis, my mother's welfare records. They painted me as white trash trying to climb the social ladder. Through Nathan, the final blow came When they offered Tommy's dying mother $50,000 to change her recommendation to Amy, she was drowning in medical bills. She took the deal. I was destroyed.

One day my daughter came back from school and ran into my arms like she was scared. I could feel her shaking so I took her inside and made some French toast, which was her favorite food. I thought she just had a really bad day and missed being at home. But I couldn't have been more wrong. Once she calmed down, she told me, Mommy, something happened today and I think I'm supposed to tell you about it. An uneasy knot formed itself in my heart when she told me that the school counselor had called her into his office for a special game. He handed my daughter a stuffed unicorn and told her that this new game was very popular with the children, which made my daughter excited and eager to learn. Then the counselor made her point the unicorn between his legs and push on it repeatedly. My daughter told me how he made weird faces at times and then closed his eyes and leaned back. Towards the end, I was so horrified and felt a wave of nausea rush through my body so I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. What kind of sick person would make a 7 year old girl do this kind of thing? Not to mention he worked at a school and it was me who willfully sent my daughter near his vicinity. I kept bouncing between blaming Myself and wanting to burn the entire world. My husband was no longer with us, so it was up to me to stand up for my daughter. I don't know what made me approach the school administration before the police, but that's exactly what I did. And the school administration laughed at me, saying that my daughter was clearly playing a prank. They said they had heard other students make similar jokes about the school counselor and said that parents should teach their kids not to lie. By the time I made it to the police station, the school had already called them and explained the situation. They thought I was a crazy mother who was trying to give merit to my daughter's filthy lie. I had looked straight into my daughter's eyes when she told me the story, so I knew she was telling the truth. But no one wanted to believe me. And I felt like I was in a nightmare. This is when I remembered something important and ran back home to open my jewelry safe. Inside there was a note that I hadn't looked at for a long time. You see, although I was currently a doctor, I had been a very inexperienced nurse at one point. And one time a very stern looking man with a lot of face tattoos walked into our hospital with a bullet wound. No other nurse wanted to treat him since he looks so scary. So they sent me. I Convinced myself that everyone deserves treatment and cleaned his wounds with the utmost concentration. I even engaged him in conversation and joked about how he should stay away from bullets in the future. When it was all over, the guy thanked me and handed me a note with his phone number on it. He said, if you ever need someone taken care of, I won't ask for any payment. I typed in that phone number and to my surprise, it actually connected. I told him who I was and he said, I remember you.

My boyfriend Jake, had been the same couch potato for three years. The guy who needed me to open pickle jars was suddenly doing push UPS at 6:00am. When I asked what sparked this change, he just shrugged and said he wanted to get healthy, but something felt wrong. It's started small. He bought protein powder and left it on the kitchen counter like some kind of trophy. Then he got a gym membership to this fancy place across town instead of the Planet Fitness two blocks away. When I suggested we work out together, he got weird and said he preferred going alone to focus. The red flags kept piling up. He started showering immediately after coming home from the gym, which seemed normal until I realized he never smelled like sweat. His gym clothes were always perfectly clean, too. One day I decided to surprise him with lunch at his gym. The guy at the front desk looked confused when I asked for Jake. Turns out he hadn't been there in weeks. Confronted him that night, he got defensive and said he switched gyms because the other one was too crowded. When I asked which gym, he stuttered and said some random name I'd never heard of. That's when I knew he was lying. So I did what any suspicious girlfriend would do. I followed him the next Tuesday. I Watched him drive past three different gyms and pull into the parking lot of a Starbucks. Through the window, I saw him sitting across from this blonde girl who definitely wasn't just a workout buddy. She was laughing at everything he said and touching his arm constantly. My heart was pounding as I watched them for 20 minutes. When she got up to leave, he grabbed her hand and kissed it. I wanted to storm in there and cause a scene, but instead I waited. He came home an hour later with this fake exhausted look, complaining about how intense his workout was. I played along for two more weeks watching him lie to my face every single day. He even started buying workout supplements and leaving them around the apartment as props. The worst part was when he'd flex his non existent new muscles and ask if I noticed any changes. And I got clever. I told him my friend Emma was looking for a new gym and asked for his recommendation. He panicked and said his gym was full and not taking new members. When I offered to call and check, he quickly said they had a waiting list and it wouldn't be worth it. That weekend, Jake said he was going to a special Saturday morning workout class. Instead, I followed him to the same Starbucks. This time they were holding hands across the table and looking at something on her phone together when he leaned over And kissed her forehead. I knew I had enough evidence, but I didn't confront him yet. I had a better plan. I went home and researched the girl on social media, found her Instagram through the Starbucks location tag. Her name was Ashley. And according to her posts, she'd been seeing someone new for the past month. The timeline matched perfectly with Jake's sudden fitness obsession. Monday night, I casually mentioned.

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning, after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day, I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy, and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was. One Afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

I spent 15 years building the internet infrastructure for our small town in Nebraska. Everyone knew me as the internet guy. When your Wi-Fi went down at 2:00am, you called me. When you wanted faster speeds for your home office, I was your guy. What most people didn't know was that I didn't work for some big company. I, I owned every cable, every tower and every router box in town. I was the provider. Everything started falling apart when Jerry Davidson got elected to City Council. This guy had been gunning for me ever since I refused to give him free internet for his campaign office two years earlier. At the first town meeting, Jerry stood up with this big presentation about bringing in competition. We need options, said, pointing at charts showing how much cheaper national providers were. Alex has had a monopoly too long. The new company, Net Connect, rolled into town with promises nobody could refuse, half the price, double the speeds and a name people recognized from TV commercials. They set up a booth at the farmers market offering gift cards just for signing up. Within three months, I watched my customer base get cut in half. By six months, I had maybe 30 customers left out of 800. People stopped waving when they saw me around town. Mrs. Henderson, who used to bring me cookies every Christmas, wouldn't even make eye contact at the grocery store, at Pete's Diner, conversations would stop when I walked in. Some people actually laughed when Jerry made jokes about my outdated service during council meetings. Tried everything. Lowered my prices below cost, offered free installation, threw in premium channels. Nothing worked. Net connected poisoned the well. My savings account hit zero. My girlfriend Katie left me for some guy who worked at the bank. My business was circling the drain and I was three months behind on my truck payment. That's when I started reading contracts real carefully. See, Net Connect had signed a deal with the city to run their fiber cables through existing infrastructure. They were using my utility poles, my access boxes, and most importantly, my signal towers. The contract gave them access, but only if I granted maintenance permissions. Harry had been so excited to stick it to me that he never bothered reading the fine print. When the city originally gave me exclusive rights to install towers 15 years ago, I wrote a clause that let me shut down signal access with 60 days notice. Back then, it seemed like a smart way to protect my investment. Now it was my nuclear option. I spent three nights going through every page of every contract. It connects infrastructure piggyback completely on my original network backbone. They never laid fresh lines because it would have cost millions. They just plugged into what I'd already built and called it an upgrade. On a Tuesday morning, I walked into City Hall and filed my 60 day notice to terminate signal access. Jerry was there picking up some paperwork and saw me at the counter. He asked what I was doing with a smug grin on his face. Just some routine maintenance paperwork, I told him. Netconnect's lawyers showed up exactly one week later.

My 11 year old daughter started acting like a grown woman and I thought it was just early puberty stuff, but then I realized something much darker was happening. My daughter was one of those girls who hit puberty like a freight train. One month she was my little girl in Pokemon t shirts. The next month I was desperately searching the junior section because nothing in kids sizes would button across her chest. I started noticing the attention before I could pretend it wasn't happening. We were at target when she said casual as anything, that the man in electronics had followed us to three different aisles. She didn't sound scared, just stated it like a fact, like she was telling me it might rain. It got bad when she started consuming content that no 11 year old should even know existed. Her iPad history at 2:00am showed romance novels about CEOs and secretaries, bookmark folders labeled Dark Romance and Age Gap. She discovered Wattpad and archive of our own reading explicit stories about innocent girls and men who know better. Her YouTube algorithm had shifted completely. Makeup tutorials for that clean girl aesthetic. How to look expensive, feminine energy that drives men crazy. She was watching videos about how to walk in heels, how to make your voice sound more sultry, how to flirt without being obvious. When I tried to stop her from consuming that Content. She turned into someone I didn't recognize. He started using therapy speak to manipulate every conversation. I was gaslighting her when I set boundaries, being toxic when I said no to crop tops. Emotionally abusive for taking her phone at night. She'd Learned these words somewhere and weaponized them perfectly. Her friend group shifted overnight. The girls her age were suddenly so immature and childish. She gravitated toward eighth graders, then high schoolers, who'd wave at her during pickup. Started lying with disturbing ease. He was at the library, but really at Starbucks with older kids. At Emma's house, but actually at the mall. She figured out how to delete specific texts while keeping others clear. Only certain parts of her history created fake contact names. Emma mom was really someone named Tyler. She started sitting differently, legs crossed like an adult. Hand gestures while talking that she'd copied from somewhere. At family dinners, she'd insert her self into adult conversations about work, drama, and relationships, offering advice like she was 30. When we visited relatives, she spent the entire time with the adults, laughing at jokes she shouldn't understand, making comments about wine and coffee preferences. She didn't have. The secrets multiplied like cancer. Her phone became Fort Knox. Password changed weekly, face ID disabled so I couldn't use it. While she slept, she'd angle the screen away reflexively. Muscle memory from constant deception. I found out from another mom that my daughter had been telling everyone she was 16, not 11. With a whole fabricated backstory about being held back. Started lying about everything. Library visit. It's that were really mall trips with high schoolers, study groups that didn't exist. Sleepovers at houses I never heard of. Her bedroom door stayed locked constantly. Music blasting to cover phone conversation. She stopped talking to me entirely. Dinner became silent warfare. One word answers while scrolling under the table. Her former best friend's mom called concerned. Apparently, my daughter had told the girl she'd outgrown their friendship. At her spring concert, she wore the required black dress, but she'd altered it somehow. Taken in the waist, shortened the hem. She looked like a teenager, not an eleven year old. As she walked across the stage, I watched father's heads turn and follow her movement. These weren't strangers. They were soccer dads, TA volunteers. My neighbor. Their gazes lingered a bit too long before they caught themselves. But what disturbed me most was her awareness of it. She wasn't innocent to the attention anymore. She expected it and seemed to feed off it. After the performance, she didn't run to me like the other kids ran to their parents. She stood with the older performers, laughing at something on someone's phone. When I finally got her attention, she rolled her eyes and mouth. Five more minutes. Like I was embarrassing her. That night, I waited until she would.

He was too scared to call you guys. Oh, okay. Well, that's fine. What's your brother's name? It's Todd. Okay, so what are we doing for you? So Todd has a girlfriend named Renee. She got pregnant, and she told Todd that he's the father. But I think she's lying, and Todd thinks she's lying. Pretty much my whole family thinks she's lying. Oh, okay. So do you think she messed around on your brother, got pregnant, and then told him, surprise, honey, we're pregnant? Yep, that's exactly what I think happened. Okay. Have you told your brother you think that's what happened? Oh, yeah, of course. Actually, I never really liked this girl to begin with, and then when she got pregnant, Todd was the one that came to me and told me that he wasn't sure how it happened. Oh, okay. I mean, well, I can tell you how it happened, but I don't think any of us need those details, so. So your own brother said, I don't think it's mine? Well, I'm his big sister, so I kind of came down on him after she got pregnant, and I was like, how could you be so irresponsible? Yeah, okay. And he was just like, I was responsible every time. Well, maybe he was just saying that so, like, you would get off his back a little. No, he straight up told me. I'm scared to say anything, but I Don't think I'm the one who did it. Oh, okay, well, why is he scared to say anything? Yeah, he's got a right to defend himself, too. That's what I told him. I was like, go and get a blood test done. And he was like, do you know how bad that's gonna look if it turns out I am the father? And I have to say, oops, sorry I accused you of sleeping around on me. It's gonna look like I don't trust her. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, but. But, you know, Jeez, the guy has the right to know the truth. So at this point, he's still with her? Yep. He's just acting like it's his baby and he's gonna stay with her all the way through everything. He's paying all this money for baby stuff, and they're even looking for a place to live together. Okay, meanwhile, you're upset for him cause you don't think it's his. No, I mean, I don't trust her. I never have. I'm sorry. I know that's a terrible thing to say about your brother's girlfriend, but it's true. No, it's. It. Look, I, I had two sisters. They hated almost every girl I ever brought home. I mean, I, I, I told girls that I did. If my sisters like you, then you pretty much passed the test. So you would like to know once and for all, for sure if your brother is really the father of this kid? Yeah. Okay, uh, couple of questions before we move forward this, because this is kind of important. Does your brother know you're doing this? And is he okay with it? Yes, he knows, and he's okay, but he just doesn't want to be involved in it. Okay. And how far along in the pregnancy is this girl? What. What's the girl's name again? Renee. Renee. How far along is Renee? She's about five months. Okay. Now, do you happen to know the name of the doctor she's been seeing for her baby? Doctor appointments or anything? I don't, but I'm sure my brother does. He goes to all the appointments with her. Okay, see if you can get the doctor's last name first, cause that's gonna help us out a ton. Okay. And then also, we're gonna need her phone number, too. Of course. Okay, I'm gonna text my brother right now. Okay, cool. I'm gonna put you on hold the shag while you do that. We're gonna hit a break. When we come back, we'll see if we can figure out the truth about what's really going on. Uh, now, this is the DOC. Do we have the doctor's name? That we don't. We don't have the name. We have the office. We have the office number. That'll work. Okay. Okay, so this is. We're gonna call Renee. Renee is the girlfriend. We're gonna call her and we're going to pretend that we are from the office that she has. Been visiting for her? Yep. Updates or checkups and stuff like that.

Now, according to my mom, I've ruined his wedding. I, 28 m, have a twin brother. Growing up, we were inseparable and until recently, I thought we were still very close. I was always more of a shy nerd and he was an extrovert that played sports throughout our childhood in high school. But we spent almost all of our time together by choice. We went our separate ways. When college came, he stayed local in Arizona and I went to college in Portland. When I graduated, I stayed there because I fell in love with the city. My friends are here. My professional networks from internships were here, etcetera. But I always flew back home for holidays, events, birthdays, etcetera. My brother announced on Instagram that he and his girlfriend of 3 years got engaged. I was incredibly happy for him and texted him congrats. He mentioned they were planning to have an engagement party in 6 to 8 weeks and I told him to let me know so I can book a flight to come celebrate. I was never told a date. If I brought it up with him or anyone in my family, they'd change the subject or say it's still being planned and confirmed. After a few weeks, I texted my brother to ask about The date because it must be getting close and I don't want to pay for a last minute flight. No response. I asked my mom for details and she said it's not really an engagement party, just a small dinner with family. There's no need to come down for it. I eventually found out that it was in fact a big party. They rented out an entire restaurant for four hours and there were about 80 guests, family, friends, cousins, everyone. Everyone was told I couldn't make it. My aunt, who was like a second mother to me, texted me that she was very disappointed I couldn't make time to join. And I replied that I would have happily come, but I was not invited. Word spread quickly about my snub and my parents and brother tried to say it was just a misunderstanding. That was almost over a year ago. Since then, I've tried to get to the bottom of why I wasn't invited over the course of months. It went from it was just meant to be a small gathering to I don't know what happened, there must have been a miscommunication, to it's just a party, it's no big deal. I asked my brother if he was mad at me. I thought maybe his fiance didn't like me, even if she or he didn't want me there. Why were my parents okay with this? This really wasn't like them. Christmas and Easter was awkward because no one But me wanted to address the elephant in the room, and any conversation about anything was like small talk with strangers. When I visited in may for my sister's birthday, I left early after my sister said, you moved so far away, it's like you're not really family anymore. You make everything feel so weird. Now, nine months ago, I got the save a date announcement.

After mom died from cancer, dad sat by her hospital bed for 16 hours holding her hand. He kept saying, I can't do this without you, Sarah. Please don't leave me. The nurses had to give him something to calm down just so he'd let go. When we got home, dad walked around like he wasn't really there. For weeks, he left all Mom's stuff exactly where it was. Her coffee mug sat on the counter with her lipstick Mark. That made me cry. Every morning he asked me, Emma, could you make her chicken Parmesan tonight? It would help me feel like she's still here. While I cooked, dad watched old home videos on repeat in the living room. At first, it was nice hearing Mom's laugh all the time and pretending like she was still with us. But as winter turned to spring, Dad's sadness shifted into something scary. He stopped sleeping in their bedroom and moved to the couch, telling me, I can't sleep in there, Emma. It smells like her perfume and I hear her breathing. At 3 in the morning, I'd find him hugging her pillow, talking to nobody. I suggested therapy and he actually agreed to go twice a week. But it wasn't long before I found appointment cards in the trash. One April night when I came out of the bathroom, he called me Sarah in the dark hallway. He immediately followed up with, sorry, Emma, you Just you looked like her for a second. His apology was anything but reassuring because something in his eyes had changed. I reminded him, dad, I'm Emma, your daughter. And he nodded slowly without saying anything. I thought it would end there, but he called me Mom's name more and more. I tried to tell myself it was just part of the process. That's when he started buying me the same clothes mom wore. These ugly flower shirts kept showing up in my closet and he'd lie they were on sale and I thought you'd look nice in them. When I told them that they were Mom's style, he'd just say exactly with this sickening smile. My shampoo kept getting replaced with Mom's brand and when I switched it back, it would mysteriously change again within days. Then one morning, all my stuff had been moved to their bedroom. When I asked why, through tears, he said, I need you close, Sarah. Emma, I mean, Emma, the nightmares are getting worse. That was the last time he called me Emma. I could tell something terrible was coming, but nothing could have prepared me for their anniversary morning. I woke up to him on my bed with a breakfast tray, roses everywhere, candles burning and their wedding song playing. He smiled and said, happy anniversary, my love. I can't believe it's been 20 beautiful years of marriage. I sat up fast and said, dad, what the f is this? Suddenly I Was hit with a wave of dizziness. When I tried to catch my balance, he smiled. You've been so tense recently, Sarah, so I put anxiety medication in your water. I sat there helpless as he pulled out red undergarments. He held it up saying, you wore this on our wedding night. Time to put it on again. I shook my head hard and said, dad, please, you're scaring me. I'm Emma. But his eyes looked empty. When I pushed the tray away, he grabbed my wrist hard. Why are you acting like this, Sarah? He said, while I screamed, mom is dead. I'm Emma. I'm your effing daughter. His twisted and he yelled, stop lying. You're my wife. You've always been my wife. He lunged forward, trying to kiss me, hands, grabbing at my chest while saying, this is our anniversary. Stop pretending you don't remember our first time. I screamed, get off me, and bit his lip until it bled. As I stumbled to the bathroom, he called, Sarah, come back. Don't lock me out on our special day. I barely locked the door before he got there. He pounded on it saying, I'll be gentle, I promise, just like our first time. Please don't be scared, my love. When I didn't respond, his tone shifted to anger. Sarah, open this door right now. A wife doesn't lock out her husband. All I wanted to do was call for help, but I didn't have my phone on me. When I heard him punching through the door, I screamed, help, somebody help me. Thankfully, somehow my neighbor, Mister Lee, heard dad was able to unlock the door after he punched through it. And he had this sick smile. My skin crawled when he said, there you are, sweetheart. No more hiding, catching me with a needle. This will help you remember who you are. I fought back as hard as I could, though I knew he could overpower me. But everything stopped when Mr Lee pounded on our front door. John, is everything okay in there? He yelled. Dad called out, everything's fine, Tom. Sarah is just having one of her episodes again. But Mr Lee yelled back.

In high school, my friend Arthur started this game called Awkward Questions. The rules were simple. You had to ask your teacher the most uncomfortable but technically appropriate question. Question. Possible points based on how flustered they got it started innocent. Missus Williams, do you think Romeo was taking advantage of Juliet? Five points for her nervous laugh. Mister Davis, why do we study the Great Depression when we're living through 1? 10 points for his visible confusion. But Arthur was competitive. He kept pushing boundaries, hunting for that perfect question that would break a teacher completely. His target was Mister Wayne, our AP chemistry teacher. Guy was unshakable. Thirty years of experience, seen every teenage trick in the book. Arthur spent weeks researching, looking for the perfect chemistry related question that would crack him. Then he found it. I found out later that Arthur had been digging through old local newspaper archives for weeks. He found a 10 year old obituary for Bruce Wayne, age 16. Died from accidental chemical poisoning. Arthur connected the dots. Same last name as our teacher, same small town. He found Mister Wayne's deceased brother. During class, Arthur raised his hand with that evil grin we all knew meant trouble. Mister Wayne, I was reading about chemical compounds last night. Is it true that when you mix household bleach with ammonia creates chlorine gas? Mister Wayne froze. Why would you ask that, Arthur? Arthur leaned back. In his chair, savoring the moment. Just curious about the chemical reaction. You know, for educational purposes. The teacher's face went white. Arthur, I need you to stay after class. We thought Arthur had finally won the game. Mister Wayne looked genuinely shaken. After class, Arthur was practically bouncing with excite. This was his masterpiece. Mister Wayne locked the door and sat down heavily. Arthur, where did you learn about that specific reaction? Just some research I found online, Arthur said, barely containing his smirk. That's when Mister Wayne broke down crying. And Arthur started smiling. You know about Bruce, don't you? Arthur smile faded. He hadn't expected this reaction. Mister Wayne's younger brother had passed away from exactly that chemical mixture. The family tragedy destroyed his parents marriage and sent his mom into severe depression. Mister Wayne became a chemistry teacher specifically to educate kids about chemical safety so no other family would go through what his did. Arthur had deliberately weaponized the teacher's worst trauma for points in a game. He reported Arthur to the principal for psychological harassment and requested a transfer to another school district. Within a week, the story spread. Parents heard about a student psychologically torturing a teacher, about his deceased brother. Words spread fast. Parents found out a student had deliberately targeted a teacher's family tragedy for a game. Arthur got expelled, not suspended, expelled. His college applications were destroyed. Every university rescinded their offers when they Learned what he'd done. Mr. Wayne Had a complete mental breakdown next day. 28 years of teaching and Arthur's calculated cruelty shattered everything he built to cope with his deceased brother. He started having panic attacks in class. Couldn't sleep. Kept seeing his dead brother's face in every student. The school had to call paramedics twice when he collapsed. His wife found him three weeks later, talking to his brother's photo, planning a chemistry lesson for him. He was admitted to a psychiatric facility. He's still there. Arthur's parents sent him to military school in another state. His dad was so ashamed, he wouldn't even drive him there. The worst part. Arthur's younger sister goes to our school now. She gets bullied constantly because everyone knows what her brother did. Kids call her psycho Arthur's sister and avoid sitting near her. She had to switch lunch periods because someone put a fake obituary in her locker with her name on it, saying she passed away from accidental chemical poisoning by her brother. All because Arthur thought targeting a teacher's dead brother would be hilarious. The game ended that day. None of us could stomach it anymore. Arthur had won, but he destroyed everything in the process.

My boss, Rachel, is basically the coolest person at our advertising agency. Last month, she sent out the group text about her party on Friday night. Everyone was hyped, talking about it during lunch breaks, planning what to wear, the whole thing. But I never got the text. I figured maybe she just forgot to add me or maybe my phone was being weird. Thursday rolls around and I'm hearing more party talk. People are discussing who's bringing what drinks and someone mentioned the karaoke machine. Starting to feel pretty left out, but I don't wanna seem desperate by asking about it. Friday afternoon comes and everyone's buzzing about getting ready after work. That's when I finally worked up the courage to walk into Rachel's office. I knocked on her door and she looked up with this bright smile. Hey, what's up? She said, I took a deep breath. So, um, I think there might have been a mix up. I didn't get the text about tonight's party. Her face immediately changed like all the color just drained out of it. She stared at me for what felt like forever before clearing her throat. Oh, right about that, she started fidgeting with her pen. The thing is, this party is more of a core team event. Core team. I've been there for two years. I worked overtime constantly and never complained. I brought donuts every Friday and covered for People when they were sick. What do you mean core team? I asked. She couldn't even look at me. Well, you know, people who are more central to the office dynamic. That hit me like a punch to the gut. I just nodded and walked out. The whole office cleared out at 5 sharp and I sat there alone pretending to work while everyone else headed to have fun without me. But here's where it gets interesting. Around 9 that night, I get a call from my friend Jamie who works in accounting. She's whispering and sounds panicked. Dude, you need to check Rachel's Instagram Story like right now. I open Instagram and there's Rachel's story from the party. Everyone's having a blast, dancing, playing beer pong. But in the background of one video, I see something that makes my blood boil. There's a whiteboard with party planning written at the top. And underneath it says who not to invite with my name right at the top of the list. But that's not even the worst part. Next to my name, someone had written too weird and kills the vibe. Other people had similar mean comments next to their names. Basically, anyone who wasn't part of Rachel's little inner circle got roasted on this board. I screenshot everything before she could delete it. Then I spent the weekend thinking about what to do. Monday morning, I walk straight to HR with the screenshots. Turns out excluding employees from company sponsored Social events based on personal preferences is a huge liability issue, especially when there's written evidence of the reasoning being discriminatory. HR launched an investigation immediately. Within a week, three people had come forward saying they felt excluded and harassed by Rachel's click behavior. Apparently this has been going on for months and I was just the first person brave enough to speak up. Rachel got fired two weeks later, not just for the party thing, but they discovered she'd been playing favourites with assignments, giving her friends easier projects and better reviews. The new boss they brought in, she's way more professional and actually treats everyone equally. We still have office parties, but now everyone gets invited properly and no one keeps mean lists. Best part is Rachel tried to get unemployment but got denied because she was terminated for misconduct. I heard through the Grapevine that she's working at a call centre now.

I used to work as a prison guard and one day our warden decided it would be a good idea to bring his 10 year old daughter in so she could see where dad works. He left her alone in his office for just a minute. When she wanted out, he found her 10 minutes later in one of the corridors bleeding out from her head with a fly on her pants undone. Watching him clutch her against his chest and hold her lifeless body repeating daddy's got you, sweetheart for hours was a sight I'll never forget. From that moment on, he became obsessed with finding out who did this. He didn't even take a day off from work, just came in next morning off, no sleep, spent the whole day grilling every prisoner in guard. He offered bribes, reduced sentences, special privileges, anything for information. I remember watching him break down between interviews then slam his head into the wall repeatedly just so the physical pain could momentarily drown out the emotional one for long enough to conduct the next interview. He grounded everybody he thought gave suspicious answers and threatened them with solitary confinement, beatings, firings for guards. He even went as far as forcing a prisoner to wear a wire during yard to hopefully catch an admission, threatening that prisoner with an extra two years to his sentence if he didn't wear it. Unfortunately, his interviews didn't get him an answer. So He started becoming more harsh. Two and a half weeks after the death, he came into work hammered and grabbed me by the shoulders, telling me today was the beginning of the end. He then rounded up all the prisoners and announced to them that until the truth about who did it comes out, they would only be getting fed every second day. The backlash was brutal and the warden took that as a sign that the people protesting were guilty. Got a hold of everyone who stepped out of line and ordered us, the guards, to beat them. Some guards, including myself, felt bad and didn't want to. But he threatened our jobs, saying if we're hesitating, then that means one of us must have called his daughter. He'd pace her.

We all knew Holly would let the world burn if it meant keeping girls safe. She literally treated female friendship like a sacred religion. She'd walk wasted girls home from parties, share her last tampon with girls she'd never met, and somehow knew which guys to avoid before anyone else did. Every girl had her number saved for emergencies because they could all count on her to fix things. There was this one time at lunch when the football players were ranking girls by their bodies out loud. Holly walked right up to their table, took photos of all of them, and announced she post them on the school's parent Facebook age with exactly what they've been saying unless they apologize to every single girl individually. That was Holly's whole identity. She lived for female solidarity. She'd stay up all night talking girls through breakups, pretend to be someone's girlfriend to get creeps to back off, fight with teachers who dress coded girls unfairly. During junior year, when the cheerleaders started that toxic diet competition, Holly brought homemade cookies every day until they stopped weighing themselves. The girls would cry on her shoulder, trust her with their darkest secrets, and she treat protecting them like her life's purpose. Then winter break passed, and Holly showed up wearing headphones, staring at her phone, completely ignoring the circle of girls who'd been waiting to tell her their break Drama when Neva ran up crying about her boyfriend cheating, Holly literally stopped around her and kept walking. She didn't hold the door for the freshman girl carrying too many books. Didn't smile back at anyone. During lunch, Amira was sobbing about her parents'divorce, and Holly would have normally dropped everything to comfort her, but she sat alone the entire time. The worst part was when Sienna fainted in the hallway from not eating. Old Holly would have been the first one there. This. Holly glanced over, watch the nurse handle it, and went back to her homework. Girls kept approaching her all day. Summer needed a tampon. Holly shrugged and said she didn't have one. Freya asked for a ride home because she felt unsafe. Holly said, call Uber without looking up. We all thought she was going through something heavy, maybe seasonal depression, maybe family problems. Some girls organized an intervention. They cornered her after school with flowers and her favorite coffee. Hallie took one look at them and said, I'm not interested. Just that. Then walked to her car. Days turned into weeks. The girls went from concerned to desperate. They made a schedule to check on her, left notes in her locker, even got the counselor involved. Hallie told the counselor she was focusing on herself and there was nothing wrong. When that didn't work, they told one of our teachers. She asked Hallie why she wasn't helping organize the Women's Empowerment Orman Assembly. Halle responded, That's not my responsibility anymore. Then we all found out what happened. During a massive New Year's Eve party at Wyatt's house. Halle had gone with her closest friends, prepared to be designated driver and protect anyone. But then someone spiked her drink, and she started feeling really sick and disoriented. She'd managed to lock herself in an upstairs bathroom when she realized something was seriously wrong. Holly had texted the group chat with her friends, the ones she called her soul sisters. She typed, please help. Something's wrong. I think someone put something in my drink. I'm scared. I locked myself in Wyatt's bathroom. Please come get me now. Then another. I can't stand up properly. Please hurry, then.

So I'm 23, oldest of five kids, and basically running my parents house like I'm the damn manager or something. I'm in school full time getting my second degree, plus I work part time in my field. My employer already said they'll take me full time once I graduate, so I'm making decent money for a student. Enough to pay for school and actually save some cash. My siblings are 20, 17, 14, and 10. My parents both work. Dad pulls crazy long hours and mom does the 9 to 5 grind at some stressful job. So guess who picks up all the slack? Me. I do literally everything. Grocery shopping every week, all the laundry for seven people, cooking dinner every single night, and meal prep on Sunday so everyone has lunches ready. I even manage my siblings chores like making sure there's dog food in the pantry so my youngest brother can actually feed our two dogs. Or that we have poop bags on the leashes. It's like being a mom to four other people. Plus going to school during Christmas break. I finally had enough saved up to buy myself a PS five. Been wanting one forever and I found one at regular price. But if you know anything about PS Fives in 2022 was basically winning the lottery. The rest of my family still shares this old PS four in the living room, but I Keep mine in my room. It's mine, I bought it. And no, I don't share it. Well, my 20 year old brother Jake started whining to my parents about how unfair it was that I had all this money and cool stuff but wouldn't share. Like, dude, get a job, but whatever. So my parents call me into the kitchen for this family meeting, which was basically them telling me I need to start paying rent. They said it wasn't fair that I was making good money while living there for free. Especially when I won't even share my gaming console. I just sat there listening to them explain how much they wanted from me monthly. And I'm doing the math in my head. After rent, I'd have maybe $800 left over each month. That's after buying my own food, gas, school supplies, everything. I went to my room and actually calculated it out on paper. If I dropped a couple classes next semester, I could go almost full time at work. It would only add one more year to my degree, but I could afford my own place. And here's the kicker. I'd actually have more free time and way more spending money than if I stayed home paying rent while doing everyone's chores. So I packed up my stuff. Everything I owned fit in my Honda Civic, which honestly was kind of depressing, but also liberating. I didn't tell them I was leaving until I was loading my Car, where are you going? My mom asked, standing in the driveway in her bathrobe. Getting my own place. Thanks for helping me realize I can afford it. I stayed at this Airbnb for two weeks while I figured out apartments, adjusted my class schedule, and got more hours at work. The Airbnb host, this older lady named Beverly, kept asking if I was okay because I was just so happy to be there. Like, I was literally excited to do my own laundry. And. Okay, I'm not gonna lie. I went a little crazy on dating apps. Living at home with 4 siblings and strict parents meant I hadn't had any.

I jerked upright in bed, heart pounding against my ribs. What are you talking about? I don't do that. He held up his phone screen, glowing in the darkness of our bedroom. I have it on video, Julia. Every single night I watched myself on the hallway camera footage, standing perfectly still at our six year old daughter's door. Two kitchen knives clutched in my hands, one in each fist. The time stamp read 12:03 a m. That's not possible, I whispered. But there I was, motionless for hours. According to the fast forward layback, miles scrolled through multiple recordings from the past week. Same position, same knives, same bacon expression on my face. I had absolutely no memory of any of it. How long has this been happening? I asked, my voice cracking. Miles pulled up the footage history on his phone. I installed the camera a month ago when Mary mentioned hearing footsteps. Thought maybe she was sleepwalking. He showed me night after night of recordings. You stand there from midnight until almost 4:00am. Then you just walk back to bed. We reviewed more footage together. Sitting at the kitchen table with his laptop, I appeared at eleven fifty eight PM in every video. Retrieved the knives from the kitchen drawer and took my position like clockwork. Miles had dark circles under his eyes. I hadn't noticed. Before, I didn't want to scare you, but this isn't normal. Julia. We need to get you help. Have you asked Mary about this? I managed to ask. He nodded slowly. She says she hears tapping on her window sometimes. I checked outside, but never found anything. My blood turned cold. Tapping on her window. I instinctively stood up and walked to the knife drawer, pulling it open. The two largest knives were at the front, handles facing out. Had I arranged them that way? That night, I forced myself to stay awake. Miles set up his phone to record me, and I sat on the couch drinking coffee. At 11:45 p m, a strange heaviness washed over me. I fought against it, digging my nails into my palms. The I hit 11:00am and everything went black. I woke up at 407:00am, standing in our bedroom, miles staring at me with wide eyes. You just stood there again. I tried to talk to you, even shook you, but you were completely gone. He showed me the new footage. I looked like a statue. Unblinking, unmoving. Except for the subtle rise and fall of my chest. The next morning, I examined Mary's window from outside. Small scratches marked the frame, concentrated around the lock. Fresh marks overlapped older ones. My hands trembled as I took photos. Miles called the police while I questioned Mary. Tell me about the tapping sounds, sweetheart. She looked up from her coloring book. They stopped. A While ago. Now I just hear you walking around outside my door. Officer McCoy arrived within the hour and exam in the window. These are tool marks. Probably from someone trying to Jimmy the lock. She photographed everything meticulously. Has anyone been watching your house? Any strange vehicles? We couldn't think of anything unusual. She recommended motion sensors for the backyard and extra locks on Mary's window. Miles installed cameras outside that afternoon. If someone's been trying to get in, we'll catch them. That night, he stayed awake to monitor all the feeds while I inevitably blacked out. He kissed my forehead at 11:45 p m. Maybe your subconscious knows something we don't. At 12:47 a m, according to Miles's frantic retelling the next morning, a figure appeared at Mary's window. Dark clothing, face obscured by a hood. It produced a thin metal tool and worked at the lock while I stood guard inside. Knives ready. The figure tried for 20 minutes before giving up and disappearing into the shadows. Miles had called 9 1 1 immediately, but the intruder vanished before police arrived. Officer McCoy reviewed the footage with us. The build looks familiar. Height about 5 feet, 10 inches. The way they moved. She paused the video. Do you recognize anything? That's when it clicked. Light hunch of the shoulders. The way they favored their left hand. Oh, my god. That's Isaac, our babysitter's boyfriend. The police moved fast. They arrested Isaac that morning at our babysitter's apartment. The search warrant revealed the worst possible outcome his lap

You get nothing when we die. Then Grandma's lawyer called. The call came while I was eating cereal before my shift at the auto parts store. Austin called. Well, this is Margaret Stevens, state attorney. Your grandmother, Eleanor, left you something. I almost laughed. There's been a mistake. My parents said I wasn't in her will. Mr Caldwell, we need to meet immediately. Two hours later, I'm staring at documents, $2.1 million a house, investment accounts all mine. But I'm adopted, I stammered. Margaret handed me a letter in Grandma's handwriting. Austin, you are not adopted. You're my biological grandson. Your father's first wife, Jennifer, was your real mother. She died when you were 2. Susan made David pretend you were adopted because she wanted you gone. My hand shook. 21 years of being treated like garbage while my siblings got cars and vacations. I work two jobs just to afford ramen. Every family dinner where they discuss college funds for Logan and Ashley. But when I asked about help with community college, dad would say you need to learn independence. Letter continued, David and Susan think they're inheriting everything. They've been spending money they don't have. The new truck, kitchen, remodel, Logan's boat they borrowed against my estate. They get nothing. But there was more. Margaret pulled out another folder. Your grandmother hired a private investigator three years ago. She documented everything. Photos of me walking to work in the rain because my bike Broke screenshots of my parents social media posts bragging about their inheritance windfall while I lived on peanut butter sandwiches. Messages between Susan and her friends. Can't wait for the old bat to die so we can finally live properly. The investigator had recorded conversations too. Susan's voice came through crystal clear. Austin thinks he's family, but he's just David's mistake from his first marriage. Once Eleanor's gone, we'll have enough money to cut them off completely. Your grandmother was furious. Margaret said she changed her will six months ago. Your parents get nothing. Your siblings get $1,000 each. Everything else goes to you. The best part, the investigator had proof they'd already spent $200,000. They didn't have new credit cards, loans against their expected inheritance, deposits on a vacation home in Florida. I drove to their house with Margaret. It was Friday night, their weekly family dinner that I was never invited to. Through the window, I could see them celebrating with champagne and expensive takeout. Susan opened the door, saw us both, and her face lit up with greed. Finally, Margaret right. How much did mother leave us? We've been waiting so patiently. Logan and Ashley crowded behind her, practically bouncing with excitement. David appeared with a bottle of champagne, ready to toast their good fortune. I smiled. Actually. She left me everything and this letter explaining how you lied about me being adopted. Susan's face went white. That's impossible. You're not even real family. Oh, but I Am I pulled out the birth certificate get grandma had kept safe. My mother was Jennifer Caldwell, you know, Dad's first wife, the one you made him pretend never existed. David's champagne bottle slipped from his hands, shattering on their expensive marble floor, the floor they'd renovated with money they thought they'd inherit. This has to be a mistake, Ashley whispered. Margaret stepped forward. There's no mistake. Austin inherits two point one million dollars, the house and all investment accounts. You three children each receive $1,000. David and Susan receive nothing. Nothing. Susan's voice cracked. But we borrowed, we spent, oh, about that $200,000 you borrowed expecting your inheritance. I held up the legal paper. The bank wants it back tomorrow with interest. Logan started crying. But my boat payments, the vacation, house deposit, not my problem. I said. Maybe you should have treated your brother better. David finally found his voice. Austin, please, we can work this out. We're family. No, I said, looking him dead in the eye. Jennifer was family. Grandma, Eleanor was family. You're just the people who made my life hell for 21 years. Margaret handed them the official paper, papers you have 30 days to vacate any property belonging to the estate. Austin is the sole heir. As we walked away, I could hear Susan screaming at David, Ashley sobbing about her college fund being gone, and Logan frantically calling someone about returning his boat. Justice tastes sweeter than any inheritance money ever could. The house keys felt perfect in my hand.

I stared at Missus Peterson through my screen door, coffee mug frozen halfway to my lips. I don't mow my lawn with Scissors. That's insane. She shifted uncomfortably on my front porch, clutching her robe tighter against the morning chill. Well, someone does. Every Sunday at exactly 4 in the morning, I hear this snip snip snip sound coming from your yard. It wakes up my whole house. I glanced past her toward my front lawn, which looked perfectly normal. Green, well maintained, clearly cut with a regular mower, like every other yard on open Drive. Missus Peterson, I use a gas mower on Saturday afternoons. You've seen me do it dozens of times. Her expression shifted from annoyed to confused as she followed my gaze to the obviously machine cut grass. But the sound is definitely coming from your property. My husband heard it, too. What exactly does it sound like? I asked, stepping outside in my pajamas to get a better view of my yard. Missus Peterson made a cutting motion with her fingers, like someone trimming hedges, but rhythmic snip snip snip for hours. I walked around to my backyard, with her following close behind, both of us scanning for anything unusual. That's when I saw them. Tiny, perfect circles cut into the grass near my back fence, each about six inches in diameter, not random patches. But precise geometric patterns carved into the lawn with surgical precision. Missus Peterson, I didn't do this. My voice came out smaller than intended. The circles formed a complex design that would have taken hours to create with Scissors. And I've been found asleep every Sunday at 4:00am for the past month. I pulled out my phone and took photos of each circle, documenting the strange pattern while Mrs. Peterson watched nervously. The cuts were too clean for animals, too precise for lawn equipment, too deliberate for vandalism. Someone had been accessing my backyard weekly to create these designs while I slept. Have you seen anyone in my yard? I asked, but she shook her head. Her bedroom window faced the front of my house, not the back. I walked to my rear gate and found what I was looking for. Fresh scratches around the lock mechanism, tiny metal shavings on the ground. Evidence someone had been picking the lock repeatedly. My stomach dropped as I realized a stranger had been entering my property for weeks without my knowledge. Missus Peterson, I need to check something inside. I ran to my security system panel and pulled up the motion detector logs. Every Sunday for the past six weeks, the backyard sensor had triggered at exactly 3:00am, then again around 7:00am. But I dismissed these as false alarms from neighborhood cats. I scrolled through the digital records, finding the same pattern week after week. Someone had been studying my routine, waiting For me to fall into deep sleep before beginning their mysterious lawn art project. The precision of the timing suggested they knew my schedule better than I did. I called the police while Mrs. Peterson waited in my kitchen, both of us staring out the window at those perfect circles. Officer Bradley arrived within twenty minutes and examined the evidence with growing concern. This level of precision suggests obsessive behavior, he said. Photographing the circles and the damaged gate lock. Someone's been planning this for weeks, possibly months. He pointed to older scratches around the lock that I'd never noticed. These marks go back further than six weeks. This person's been accessing your property much longer than the lawn cutting. I felt violated in a way I couldn't articulate. Someone had been treating my home as their personal art studio while I slept defenseless inside. The officer recommended changing all my locks immediately and installing motion activated cameras throughout the backyard. Two weeks later, my new security cameras captured everything. Exactly 3:00am on Sunday, a figure in dark clothing climbed over my back fence and began the meticulous process of cutting grass with small scratching Scissors. But when I reviewed the footage in daylight, zooming in on the person's face, my world tilted completely. It was my ex boyfriend, Nathan, who had broken up with eight months ago after discovering he'd been secretly filming me in my own bathroom. The same Nathan who'd sworn he'd leave me alone after I Threatened a restraining order. The same Nathan who apparently still had a key to my back gate and when we dated, and had been using it to continue violating my space in increasingly elaborate ways. The circles weren't random art. When I printed out photos of all the patterns and arranged them chronologically, they spelled out words. Mine in the first week, forever in the second, watching in the third. Nathan had been leaving me messages in my own lawn, counting on my Assumption that the noise was just. Neighborhood maintenance Officer Bradley arrested Nathan the following Sunday as he climbed over my fence with his Scissors and a flashlight. The investigation revealed he'd been documenting his visits with photos, keeping a detailed journal of my daily routines, and planning to escalate to breaking into my house. Nathan got 18 months in jail for stalking and trespassing. I got new locks, better security cameras, and the knowledge that someone cutting grass at 4:00am is never just about lawn care.

Growing up, my dad had one phrase that he loved. My house, my rules. When I was 16 and wanted to dye my hair purple for junior year, he stood in the bath from doorway, blocking my path. Not under my roof, Alexis. You want purple hair, get your own place. When my boyfriend asked me to prom, dad made him sit through a two hour interrogation before declaring, no dating until you're 18. My house, my rules. I couldn't even watch PG thirteen movies until I was 17 because inappropriate content isn't welcome under my roof. My friends stopped coming over after dad made them sign a behavioral contract to enter our home. He controlled what I wore. No ripped jeans in my house. You look homeless. What I ate vegetarian phase. Not at my dinner table. And my opinions, too. You don't get to disagree with me while you're living rent free. When I got accepted to art school, he laughed. Art degree? Not with my money. You'll study business or nothing. Mom would whisper apologies when he wasn't looking, but never stood up to him. The worst part was his favourite closing line whenever I protested. When you have your own place, you can do whatever you want. Don't like it? There's the door. He'd literally point to the front door, knowing I had nowhere to go. At 17 with eight. Two dollars, In my savings account. Life isn't fair, Princess. The person who pays the bills makes the rules. Remember that. Well, I took student loans and went to art school anyway, living in a studio apartment with three roommates and a family of roaches. Dad called it learning life the hard way. Should have listened to me about that business degree, he'd say during Sunday dinners, while I was building my graphic design portfolio at 3 a m. Dad was getting comfortable in early retirement at 55, spending his days watching Fox News and calling me to criticize my lifestyle choices. Still living in that dump, he'd ask. Still single because you're too picky? Still wasting time on those computer drawings? His words hurt, but I kept going. Meanwhile, his perfect life started cracking. Mom finally left him after 30 years, tired of the controlling behavior. She's going through menopause, he told everyone, refusing to admit she'd simply had enough. Then his health declined, and he got diabetes. From decades of my house, my beer choices. He even refused to take his medications properly, because no doctor tells me what to do in my own home. Next, his house started falling apart, with a roof leaking and the foundation cracking. But he was too proud to ask for help. And too cheap to hire anyone. I built this house. I'll maintain it my way. By the time I landed my senior design director position, making six figures at 29, Dad was 67, living alone in a deteriorating house, alienated from most family members and struggling with basic tasks, but still preaching about his rules whenever anyone would listen. Then one day, my phone rang and his name popped up. Alexis. How's my successful daughter? Red Flag already? He never spoke that nicely. What do you need, dad? Can't a father call his daughter? You only call when you want something. Long pause. The house is getting to be too much. Your mother used to handle things, but now she's gone. I was thinking maybe I could stay with you for a while. I knew this was coming. He'd been posting on Facebook about his struggles, fishing for sympathy. But I wasn't going to just refuse because I had a secret plan. So I told him, of course you can stay with me. Dad. I have a

We all knew Holly would let the world burn if it meant keeping girls safe. She literally treated female friendship like a sacred religion. She'd walk wasted girls home from parties, share her last tampon with girls she'd never met, and somehow knew which guys to avoid before anyone else did. Every girl had her number saved for emergencies because they could all count on her to fix things. There was this one time at lunch when the football players were ranking girls by their bodies out loud. Holly walked right up to their table, took photos of all of them, and announced she post them on the school's parent Facebook age with exactly what they've been saying unless they apologize to every single girl individually. That was Holly's whole identity. She lived for female solidarity. She'd stay up all night talking girls through breakups, pretend to be someone's girlfriend to get creeps to back off, fight with teachers who dress coded girls unfairly. During junior year, when the cheerleaders started that toxic diet competition, Holly brought homemade cookies every day until they stopped weighing themselves. The girls would cry on her shoulder, trust her with their darkest secrets, and she treat protecting them like her life's purpose. Then winter break passed, and Holly showed up wearing headphones, staring at her phone, completely ignoring the circle of girls who'd been waiting to tell her their break Drama when Neva ran up crying about her boyfriend cheating, Holly literally stopped around her and kept walking. She didn't hold the door for the freshman girl carrying too many books. Didn't smile back at anyone. During lunch, Amira was sobbing about her parents'divorce, and Holly would have normally dropped everything to comfort her, but she sat alone the entire time. The worst part was when Sienna fainted in the hallway from not eating. Old Holly would have been the first one there. This. Holly glanced over, watch the nurse handle it, and went back to her homework. Girls kept approaching her all day. Summer needed a tampon. Holly shrugged and said she didn't have one. Freya asked for a ride home because she felt unsafe. Holly said, call Uber without looking up. We all thought she was going through something heavy, maybe seasonal depression, maybe family problems. Some girls organized an intervention. They cornered her after school with flowers and her favorite coffee. Hallie took one look at them and said, I'm not interested. Just that. Then walked to her car. Days turned into weeks. The girls went from concerned to desperate. They made a schedule to check on her, left notes in her locker, even got the counselor involved. Hallie told the counselor she was focusing on herself and there was nothing wrong. When that didn't work, they told one of our teachers. She asked Hallie why she wasn't helping organize the Women's Empowerment Orman Assembly. Halle responded, That's not my responsibility anymore. Then we all found out what happened. During a massive New Year's Eve party at Wyatt's house. Halle had gone with her closest friends, prepared to be designated driver and protect anyone. But then someone spiked her drink, and she started feeling really sick and disoriented. She'd managed to lock herself in an upstairs bath through when she realized something was seriously wrong. Holly had texted the group chat with her friends, the ones she called her soul sisters. She typed, please help. Something's wrong. I think someone

I jerked upright in bed, heart pounding against my ribs. What are you talking about? I don't do that. He held up his phone screen, glowing in the darkness of our bedroom. I have it on video, Julia. Every single night I watched myself on the hallway camera footage, standing perfectly still at our six year old daughter's door. Two kitchen knives clutched in my hands, one in each fist. The time stamp read 12:03 a m. That's not possible, I whispered. But there I was, motionless for hours. According to the fast forward layback, miles scrolled through multiple recordings from the past week. Same position, same knives, same bacon expression on my face. I had absolutely no memory of any of it. How long has this been happening? I asked, my voice cracking. Miles pulled up the footage history on his phone. I installed the camera a month ago when Mary mentioned hearing footsteps. Thought maybe she was sleepwalking. He showed me night after night of recordings. You stand there from midnight until almost 4:00am. Then you just walk back to bed. We reviewed more footage together. Sitting at the kitchen table with his laptop, I appeared at eleven fifty eight PM in every video. Retrieved the knives from the kitchen drawer and took my position like clockwork. Miles had dark circles under his eyes. I hadn't noticed. Before, I didn't want to scare you, but this isn't normal. Julia. We need to get you help. Have you asked Mary about this? I managed to ask. He nodded slowly. She says she hears tapping on her window sometimes. I checked outside, but never found anything. My blood turned cold. Tapping on her window. I instinctively stood up and walked to the knife drawer, pulling it open. The two largest knives were at the front, handles facing out. Had I arranged them that way? That night, I forced myself to stay awake. Miles set up his phone to record me, and I sat on the couch drinking coffee. At 11:45 p m, a strange heaviness washed over me. I fought against it, digging my nails into my palms. The I hit 11:00am and everything went black. I woke up at 407:00am, standing in our bedroom, miles staring at me with wide eyes. You just stood there again. I tried to talk to you, even shook you, but you were completely gone. He showed me the new footage. I looked like a statue. Unblinking, unmoving. Except for the subtle rise and fall of my chest. The next morning, I examined Mary's window from outside. Small scratches marked the frame, concentrated around the lock. Fresh marks overlapped older ones. My hands trembled as I took photos. Miles called the police while I questioned Mary. Tell me about the tapping sounds, sweetheart. She looked up from her coloring book. They stopped. A While ago. Now I just hear you walking around outside my door. Officer McCoy arrived within the hour and exam in the window. These are tool marks. Probably from someone trying to Jimmy the lock. She photographed everything meticulously. Has anyone been watching your house? Any strange vehicles? We couldn't think of anything unusual. She recommended motion sensors for the backyard and extra locks on Mary's window. Miles installed cameras outside that afternoon. If someone's been trying to get in, we'll catch them. That night, he stayed awake to monitor all the feeds while I inevitably blacked out. He kissed my forehead at 11:45 p m. Maybe your subconscious knows something we don't. At 12:47 a m, according to Miles's frantic retelling the next morning, a figure appeared at Mary's window. Dark clothing, face obscured by a hood. It produced a thin metal tool and worked at the lock while I stood guard inside. Knives ready. The figure tried for 20 minutes before giving up and disappearing into the shadows. Miles had called 9 1 1 immediately, but the intruder vanished before police arrived. Officer McCoy reviewed the footage with us. Bill, looks familiar. Height about 5 feet, 10 inches. The way they moved. She paused the video. Do you recognize anything? That's when it clicked. The slight hunch of the shoulders, the way they favored their left hand. Oh, my god. That's Isaac, our babysitter's boyfriend. The police moved fast. They arrested Isaac that morning at our

My best friend Ford, had the craziest parents. Last year, when he got an 89 on a pre test, they completely lost it. They blamed his social life and said, you're not allowed to take one step out of this house except for school. No exceptions. And they weren't kidding. He literally wasn't allowed to go to birthday parties, field trips, or even study groups. Saying, your friends are distractions. From now on, you focus only on academics. We tried to convince them that none of those things were a distraction, but they refused to listen. So when I handed Ford an invitation to my birthday, he handed it back with a deep frown. Sorry. You know, they'd never let me go. The whole not a single step out of this house rule, remember? But that's when my friend Logan had an idea. Then let's just carry you out. We stared at him, thinking it was the most ridiculous thing we'd heard. But when you fight crazy with crazier. Well, it was worth a shot. So we showed up to Ford's door for the first time with our first attempt, a rolling office chair. I rang the doorbell and took a deep breath. Good afternoon, Ford's wonderful parents. I need Ford for a group project. Oh, no. He strictly can't take one step out of the house. Yes, we know. So he won't. Ford grinned, seeing Us through the doorway and quickly leapt onto the office chair. He'll be in this seat the entire time. Not one step. Ford's parents stared like it was the stupidest thing they'd ever heard. But they couldn't exactly argue against it, either. So Ford rolled all the way to my birthday party. The next time we showed up, his mom instantly said, no rolling chairs allowed. Logan shrugged. Already prepared. Two other guys popped out from the bushes and helped us literally carry Ford out on our shoulders, like they do in funerals, but without the cat. Get you! Said he can't leave. We're removing him. That's the same thing, she argued. No, no. This is involuntary relocation. We kept switching up tactics. Every time, a new part of the rule got added. Can't exit the house through any doorway. We brought a ladder to his window and transported him away with a shopping cart. Can't leave without a chaperone. We printed out a cardboard cut out of his dad and carried that around, too. At some point, Ford managed to leave the house to go bowling with us just by dressing up in a costume and saying, well, I'm not Ford right now. I'm Iron Man. Unfortunately, that was the final straw. After his last stunt, Ford got completely grounded. No door, no phone, no anything. It's over. They won, I said, feeling down that he wasn't even able to go to the class's end of the year party. But Logan wasn't ready to give up. Logan gathered everyone and said, if Ford can't leave, I say we bring the party to Ford. Everyone cheered at the idea, and honestly, it was the best one he had yet. So that Saturday night, 30 of us showed up at once, carrying around our world history textbooks. Study group. Ford answered the door with a shocked expression. My parents just stepped out. What are you guys doing here? We grinned. Well

The courtroom erupted until I stood, handed the judge a two page document, and said, check again. Judge simply looked at my wife and burst out laughing. My name is James, and three months ago I caught my wife Lauren cheating with her yoga instructor. She filed for divorce immediately, thinking she'd hit the Jack pot. Since we've been married for five years. Lauren strutted into that Phoenix courtroom wearing a two thousand dollar dress I'd bought her, confident as hell. Her lawyer was already calculating his commission on what they thought would be a four million dollar payout for my construction business and dad's inheritance. The whole courtroom was packed. Lauren had actually invited some of her friends to watch what she called James's comeuppance. She been telling everyone for weeks how she was about to become independently wealthy. Your honor, her attorney announced, adjusting his expensive tie, missus Peterson deserves substantial compensation for supporting her husband's career growth during their five year marriage. Lauren actually winked at me from across the room. She thought I was just some heartbroken guy who'd roll over and pay whatever she demanded. Her friends in the gallery were practically grinning, waiting for the show. But here's what Lauren didn't know. Six months before I caught her cheating, I'd started noticing weird charges on our joint credit card. Expensive dinners at restaurants I've never been to, Hotel rooms booked during girls trips that didn't add up. Designer lingerie purchases that never made it home. The final straw was when I found an eight hundred dollar charge at a jewelry store downtown. When I asked Lauren about it, she said she bought herself a birthday present. Problem was, her birthday wasn't for four months. So I hired a private investigator named Frank. Best five thousand dollars I ever spent. Frank followed Lauren for six weeks, but he discovered was worse than I imagined. The yoga instructor was just the latest in a long line of affairs. There was also her personal trainer, a bartender from her favorite restaurant, and even one of my own business partners. Lauren had been using our joint accounts to fund these relationships. Expensive gifts, romantic getaways, even paying for her affairs. Gym memberships. She'd blown through nearly $50,000 of our money over two years. The two page document I handed Judge Ramirez wasn't financial records. It was Frank's detailed investigation report proving Lauren had been having multiple affairs for over two years. Complete with time stamped photos, hotel receipts, restaurant bills, and screenshots of explicit text messages. In Arizona, adultery doesn't automatically disqualify you from alimony. But it sure does when you've been systematically draining marital assets to fund your affairs. It's called waste of marital property, and it's a big deal in divorce court. The judge read the first page slowly, his eyebrows climbing higher with each line. To page two. Study the photos and then burst out laughing so hard his glasses nearly fell off. Mrs. Peterson, he said, trying to compose himself, not only are you getting nothing from this divorce, but according to this evidence, you owe your husband $47,000 for system malicious misuse of marital funds. Lauren's face went from smug to confused to horrified in about three seconds flat. Her friends in the gallery started whispering frantically. One of them actually got up and left. Her lawyer immediately started packing his briefcase, clearly realizing this case had just become a career nightmare instead of a payday. Furthermore, Judge Ramirez continued, given the extensive documentation of financial misconduct, Mrs. Peterson will be responsible for all legal

Then I saw the group photo. All of them, on a private beach in Maui. I stared at my phone in disbelief. My entire family had ditched my wedding for a vacation. The caption read, finally together. Like I didn't exist. But here's what they didn't know. For years, I've been quietly bankrolling their lifestyle. The family business cards all linked to my accounts. Their mortgage co signs my credit. The lake house utilities, auto pay from my bank. I've been the invisible ATM, funding their perfect lives while they whispered that my wife wasn't their kind of people. So I sent one text back. Perfect timing. Then I called my attorney. Within an hour, I'd cut off every shared account, canceled every auto payment, and revoked access to everything. The secondary property my sister lived in. She was using my credit for the rate. Not anymore. It started small. Day 3, the dealership called about a bounced car lease. Day 5, the office building sent late rent warnings. By week 2, the group chat was pure your chaos. Can someone cover the lakehouse utilities? My card got declined for Scottsdale. Does the company still cover insurance? They were scrambling, but still no apology. Just confusion about why their money fountain suddenly dried up. Then my sister called. First time since the wedding. Not congratulations or sorry we missed it. Just. You can't do this to us. I Didn't even answer. Just blocked the number. But the real fun was just beginning. See, I'd forgotten about one little detail. My dad's precious boat. The 40 foot yacht he loved showing off at the Marina every weekend. Guess whose name was on the insurance policy? Week 3, I got a call from the Marina. Sir, your boat insurance was declined for non payment. We need it removed by Friday or it gets impounded. I could have warned him. Should have, maybe. Instead, I drove to the Marina Thursday night with my wife and a bottle of champagne. We sat on the dock and watched them tow away Dad's pride and joy. My wife raised her glass. To new beginnings. To expensive lessons. I replied. The group chat exploded. The next morning, my aunt was practically screaming in all caps, the boat is gone! Who didn't pay the insurance? Dad called me 17 times. I let every single one go to voicemail. Each message got more desperate. Son, please call me back. There's been some mistake. We can work this out. Work what out? That I skipped my wedding for cocktails on a beach? Then my mom tried a different approach. She showed up at my office unannounced, tears streaming down her face. Security called up to ask if I wanted to see her. Tell her I'm in Maui, I said. The security guard paused. Sir, she says she's your mother. Not anymore. But the nuclear option came when my Uncle called. Uncle Rick, the family mediator. The guy who always smooth things over at Thanksgiving. His voice was shaking. Your father's having chest pains. The stress is killing him. You need to stop this. Funny, I said I had chest pains, too. Right around the time I saw 40 people I love. Choosing a vacation over the most important day of my life. That's different, friend, and you know it. You're right. Their betrayal was a choice. His consequences are karma. But then came the lawyers. Three weeks later, they tried to negotiate through legal channels. They wanted me back, but only if I left my wife. The contract literally said realignment of personal affiliations. That's when I knew they still

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently. And just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was 9 p m. On a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key. Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was soft, full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold hold in his eyes I've never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me He picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear. From rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialed a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine. It's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed six months ago? File everything. Tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my daughter. I hit another number. Dad, it's happening. Can you come get us? Bring the truck. Caroline, you can't just take her. Jonathan jumped up from the couch. I smiled, and I knew it looked cold as ice. Actually, I can see. Jonathan, I've been documenting your behavior for months. The times you called Nora a mistake. The texts where you said you wished she'd never been born. The videos of you screaming at her for normal kid things. His face went completely white. My lawyer has everything. Screenshots, recordings, witness statements from the neighbors who've seen how you treat her. I kissed Nora's forehead. She was finally starting to warm up in my arms. Oh, and here's my favorite part.

When I was 17, my classmate Derek threw 50 bucks at me in the school parking lot and desperately said, I need you to be my boyfriend for one hour to scare off my mom's church friends. His mom thought he was gay because she found his elaborate skincare routine and absolutely freaked out. She was bringing her entire prayer circle over for what she called a healing intervention to save Derek's soul from eternal damnation. Act super gay and make them uncomfortable, Derek explained frantically while pacing nervously. They'll get so weirded out they'll pack up and leave within 20 minutes. Easy money, right? I showed up at exactly three PM wearing the tightest jeans I could squeeze into and a bright pink shirt. I knocked on the door and screamed Derek, baby, so loud that neighbors three houses down started coming outside to see what catastrophe was happening. His mom answered with five absolutely horrified church ladies clustered behind her like a religious huddle. Prepare, preparing for spiritual warfare. I immediately bear hugged Derek and loudly announced Sweetie Pie. I brought us matching cucumber face masks and a carefully curated playlist of Broadway show tunes for a romantic spa day. Derek's face went completely pale, but I was fully committed to this Oscar worthy performance. For the next hour, I went into full theater kid mode like my life depended on it. I called him Sugar Plum Honey Bunny and my precious little cinnamon roll. I critiqued his mom's curtain choices with the intensity of a professional interior designer, started reorganizing their entire spice rack alphabetically while humming songs from Hamilton loudly complained that their throw pillows didn't match the seasonal aesthetic vision I was going for. The church ladies looked like they were watching a slow motion car crash that they couldn't look away from. One kept fanning herself frantically with a church program. Another was gripping her purse like it was a life saver in a stormy sea. Then I made my absolutely fatal mistake. I, I spotted their old dusty piano sitting in the corner and declared dramatically with full jazz hands, Derek, Honey, let's sing that special duet we've been practicing for the school talent show. Without waiting for his response, I launched into the most ridiculously over the top rendition of a Whole New World that is ever been performed outside of Broadway. Derek just stood there completely mortified and frozen like a deer in headlights. When I finished with a dramatic flourish, the church lady slowly started clapping. Then another joined in. Then all five of them erupted in thunderous applause like I had just performed at Carnegie Hall. Young man, the head church lady said with actual tears streaming down her weathered face. That was the most beautiful soul stirring thing I've ever heard in my entire life. Derek, you absolutely must.

He grabbed all his stuff and moved 3 rows up the school bus without a word. Jason, what's wrong? I was just kidding. I called after him, but he wouldn't turn around. That's when I heard it stay. See, my girlfriend's best friend was crying her eyes out in the back row. When I turned to look, her friend whispered urgently in her ear and she glanced at me before crying harder. Okay, hey, that was definitely weird. I started to wonder whether my joke was really that offensive. That's when my phone buzzed. Three missed calls from dad, but there was no signal. And at the red light, I caught the bus driver wiping his eyes in the rearview mirror. In my three years of knowing him, the most emotion he'd shown was mild annoyance when kids left trash on the seats. A cold feeling crept into my stomach. I got up to go talk to Jason, but Missus Unfitzharris blocked the aisle. Sit down. We're moving. I just need to sit down. I'd never heard her voice like that. I sat. But the second we got to the destination, I cornered Jason. Dude, what is going On he backed away. Nothing. I just, I need space, bro. I was just kidding. I, I don't know if I'd pick my mom or my girlfriend. Why did you have to tell everyone what I said? Sid appeared out of nowhere and pulled me aside. Our team captain who never said more than pass the ball to me, grabbed my shoulders. Bro, if you need to talk about anything, I'm here. About what? I was almost shouting now. He just squeezed my shoulder and walked away. That cold feeling in my stomach was spreading. During the water break, Ryan shuffled over. This kid didn't even know my name. Yo. The blonde Kaylee from volleyball thinks you're cute. She's single now, too. The words hit like a punch. Dude, what the hell. I flashed him my lock screen. I have a girlfriend. His face went white. Just trying to help you move forward, man. Move forward. From what? He practically ran away. I tried calling my.

Oh, yeah, you like that? I yelled into my headset microphone. Beg daddy for more! I added. Just. My wife busted through my door. Gotcha! My wife shouted. Dozens of people poured into the room, glaring at me. My parents, her parents, my best friend, and even a lawyer were all there to witness the greatest misunderstanding of all time. So I told my wife I needed to focus for two hours because I had an important commitment with friends. I locked my office door and put a cute little do not disrupt sign on the outside. My wife ended up walking by and hearing me through the door, growling, yeah, baby, just like that. That's exactly what I've been asking for. She froze and pressed her ear against the door. Oh, Adam, you're so good at this! A high pitched feminine voice said, giggling. Are you staying on all night? I need you. My wife's hands started shaking. Her heart pounded. She heard me laugh and say something about getting dirty and going all night. She stumbled to our bedroom and sat on the bed staring at nothing. When I came out two hours later, I kissed her goodnight like nothing happened, not realizing that my wife was already brewing up a plan on how she'd end me. My wife started sitting beside my locked door, secretly recording all of the suspicious sessions on her phone. She caught the Female voice taunting Adam, is that the best you can do? And me responding with, I'm gonna destroy you so hard. Yes, daddy! The female giggled. My wife even managed to record me saying, I spent $500 on her last night, and I do it again. She's perfect. He's everything I wanted. With all the male voices congratulating me. My wife was understandably furious, showing the recordings to her sister. That's definitely a woman, her sister said. And she sounds young. Oh my god. Is your husband. Is he having an affair? They went to a divorce lawyer the next day. He listened to the recordings and nodded grimly. Get video evidence, he said. Get witnesses. We'll bury him in court. My wife assembled what she called the intervention team. Both sets of parents, my best friend, who she convinced would be saving me from myself, the lawyer with his phone ready to record, her sister with her phone is backup. Even our neighbor, who was just happy to be a part of something fun. We'll catch him mid fair, my wife said with rage in her eyes. And she did catch me doing something, just not what she was expecting. So that night, during my usual gaming session time, the entire intervention team burst through my door. Gotcha! My wife yelled, but everyone else just froze, staring at me and my computer monitor showing a cartoon dragon breathing rainbow fire at a bunch of wizards in ridiculous clothes. Um. Can I help you? I asked, blinking back at them. Adam! The high pitched female voice shrieked through my speakers. Did you just go AFK during the boss fight? We're dying here! My wife pointed at the speakers frantically. There! That's her! That's the woman he's been cheating on me with! What? Cheating? I pulled up my discord window and showed them the five male friends I've been gaming with every week. Ray, Simon, and three random teens that kick butt at the game. That voice you've been hearing. That's Ray, I said, pointing to the bald guy on the screen. He waved and said hi. With the female voice changer still on. Everyone took a step back in horror. He quickly turned the voice changer off. Oh, sorry about that, he said, now in his regular voice.

I said, fair enough, and quietly canceled our 85,000 dollar wedding. Her face went pale when she got the cancellation notice. I'm watching my ex fiance Bianca blow up my phone right now. She just found out I canceled our entire wedding that was supposed to happen in 4 months. See, I own a tech consulting firm that's done pretty well. Not yacht money, but comfortable. She's an influencer making maybe 30 k a year. When we got engaged last year after dating for 3 years, she immediately went into wedding planning overdrive. Not just any wedding. Her dream wedding. Historic 8 venue for $15,000, catering for 250 guests at $30,000, flowers for $8,000, photographer and videographer for $10,000. Her dress for $12,000, live band for $6,000. The list kept going. Total damage $85,000. I was fine with it initially. I loved her, wanted her happy, had the money saved. But then my lawyer friend Garrett pulled me aside at a barbecue. Yo, you getting a prenup? Haven't thought about it. Dude, you own a business. You need one. If she's cool, no harm done. So I brought it up that night casually. Hey, Garrett mentioned we should probably do a prenup. Standard stuff for business owners. The temperature in the room dropped in. You think I'm a gold digger? Bianca snapped. No, it's just standard legal Protection. If you loved me, you'd trust me. I do trust you. This is just. I'll Sign a prenup when hell freezes over. Bianca, be reasonable. You be reasonable. We're supposed to be partners. What's yours is ours, but what's mine is. Well, you know, I don't have money like you. Don't be ridiculous. God, why are you being so cheap? She stormed off. I figured she needed time to cool down. Nope. Next day, she told her whole family I was financially abusing her by asking for a prenup. Her mom, Deedee, called, screaming, how dare you insult my daughter like this? I asked for a standard prenup. That's not an insult. She's giving you the best years of her life. She's 28, not 80. And I'm giving her mine, too. A real man doesn't need contracts with his wife. Click. She hung up on me. Bianca came back that evening, acting like nothing happened. Started showing me centerpiece options. We need to resolve the prenup thing first. I said. There's nothing to resolve. I'm not signing it now. Roses or peonies? Bianca, I'm serious. So am I. Drop it or there won't be a wedding. Okay, good. So peonies? Sure. Whatever you want. She smiled, thinking she'd won. Started talking about napkin colors and chair sashes. I smiled and nodded, but went to bed thinking. Woke up knowing exactly what I had to do the next morning. I started making calls. Not dramatic ones, just practical ones. First, a venue explained I needed to cancel due to irreconcilable differences that have emerged. They were Surprisingly cool. Apparently this happens more than you'd think. Got 60% of my deposit back since it was over 120 days out. Next tater, same story. 50% back. Photographer actually gave me 100% back because he'd already booked another wedding for that date at a higher rate. Solid dude. Band, florist, everyone one by one quietly canceled. Didn't tell Bianca. Didn't tell anyone except my best friend Marcus, who thought I was either genius or insane. Meanwhile, Bianca was in full bridezilla mode, created a wedding Instagram, posted daily about becoming Mrs. My last name, and can't wait to marry my provider. Yeah, that post told me everything I needed to know. She kept pushing about other stuff too. You know, if you drop this prenup nonsense, I might consider having your groomsmen Marcus in the wedding party. Marcus is my best friend. He's already my best man. Well, I think my cousin.

My fiance Rebecca really picked the worst time to call me paranoid about her ex, Nate. We were literally sitting there tasting wedding cakes when she brought it up. She kept insisting they were just friends now and I was being controlling. The thing was, I'd come home early from a work trip last week and saw his car leaving our apartment complex at 2:00am. She had no idea I'd seen it. Every time his name popped up on her phone, she'd flip it face down real quick. When she called me insecure again, I decided to call her bluff. You're right. I'm being unfair. Let's invite Nate to your parents anniversary dinner next week, I said. I watched all the color drain from her face. She tried to backtrack, saying her family wouldn't want extra guests at the their special dinner, but I pushed harder. I'll call him myself to show I trust you. She was trapped and we both knew it. She agreed, but her hands were literally shaking that night. I called Nate and made sure to put him on speaker so Rebecca could hear everything. I told him I wanted to apologize for being the jealous boyfriend and invited him to the family dinner. Rebecca just sat there watching me, completely stuck. He tried to turn me down, said it wasn't a good idea, but I Kept pushing, telling him Rebecca really wanted him there. I even offered to pick him up myself, you know, to show there were no hard feelings. When I picked him up that night, the guy was sweating through his dress shirt. During the drive, he mentioned Rebecca's parents hated him, but wouldn't tell me why. We walked into that dinner together, and I swear, the whole room just froze. Rebecca's mom dropped her wine glass, and it shattered all over the floor. Her Dad's face went from normal to purple in about two seconds. What is he doing here? He practically growled. I played innocent and explained I'd invited Rebecca's friend to make peace. Her sister actually laughed out loud. Friends? After what he did to her? Right then, Rebecca's phone lit up on the table. A text from Nate popped up on the screen. This was a mistake. We should be more careful. Everyone saw it. Her sister snatched the phone before Rebecca could grab it. More messages were right there on the lock screen. Meeting times. Last night was amazing. And what looked like photos being sent back and forth. Her dad jumped up so fast, his chair fell backwards. You're seeing him again. Nate was already heading for the door. Rebecca ran after him, begging him to wait. That's when her family just exploded. Her mom started telling me how Nate had cheated on Rebecca years ago with her own roommate. He'd lied about it six months. Straight. The whole family had been there for Rebecca through that nightmare of a breakup. And now she was sneaking around with him again. Two months before our wedding, Rebecca came back inside with her makeup running down her face. Her family looked at her like she was a strange. They kept telling me story after story about what Nate had put her through. How could you invite him here? Rebecca screamed at me. I stayed calm and reminded her that. She told me he was harmless. What was wrong with inviting a friend to dinner? Her family wouldn't stop listing all the terrible things Nate had done. The cheating, the constant lies, how he'd complete

So I moved across the country for my dream job. But six months later, she showed up at my door, saying, I'm ready to commit now, because distance doesn't matter when it's real love. And I laughed before introducing her to my new fiance, who was cooking dinner in our kitchen. I'm Marcus, 26, and when Jess dumped me six months ago, she said I was emotionally unavailable and socially stunted. Her exact words. You hide behind your work and can't form real connections. I need someone who actually has friends and knows how to be vulnerable. This happened right after I got accepted to my dream veterinary residency in Denver. We've been together two years, and I thought we were solid. I was planning to propose that Christmas, even had the ring picked out. The breakup destroyed me. I spent three days eating cereal in bed, questioning everything. Was I really that disconnected? Maybe she was right. Maybe I was just using her as a placeholder while focusing on my career. But I'd committed to the residency. So I packed up and drove to Denver with my clothes, textbooks, and a broken heart. If I was going to be miserable, at least I'd do something I loved. The animal hospital was this busy emergency clinic downtown. Doctor Peterson put me on 12 hour shifts immediately. I was so exhausted learning New procedures that I barely thought about. Jess. Something unexpected happened, though. My colleague Mike kept inviting me to trivia night at this time bar. I made excuses. Too tired, had studying. But Mike was persistent, and I finally gave in just to shut him up. Trivia night was actually fun. Mike's team called themselves the Possum 4 and competed against other medical professionals. I was weirdly good at Animal Facts, making me valuable for the first time in months. I was laughing and genuinely enjoying people's company. Mike introduced me to his hiking group. Outdoorsy medical people doing weekend trails around Colorado. I'd always loved nature, but never had anyone to explore with. Suddenly, I was spending Saturdays climbing mountains and having real conversations with people who weren't. Just then I started volunteering at the city animal shelter on days off. They needed someone with medical training for health assessments. That's where I met Diana. She was the shelter coordinator, this amazing woman who knew every single animal's personality and history. She'd work late with difficult rescue cases, and I started staying to help with medical check UPS. We talk for hours about each animal's progress and recovery stories. Diana had this gift for seeing potential in every broken creature. She was patient, compassionate, incredibly smart about animal behavior. Three months later, we went on our first date to a dog friendly brewery where half our shelter animals had been adopted. We spent the evening pointing out our kids And discussing dreams of opening our own rescue. Focused practice with Diana. Conversation felt effortless. We could talk about work, family, random thoughts. Everything flowed naturally. I'd never experienced that easy connection, even with Jess. Diana actually listened when I talked about cases. Last month, I proposed at the same dog park where we had our first date. I brought three shelter dogs, each wearing part of the message on their collars. Diana cried and said yes before I could even kneel. We moved in together two weeks ago into this cute apartment walking distance from both the hospital and shelter. Diana cooks most nights, since my schedule is insane, and I help with adoption paperwork and medical evaluations. Yesterday, coming home from a brutal shift, I saw someone on our apartment steps.

I took in a foster kid for a quick paycheck. I know how that sounds, but hear me out. Theo was 17 and had been returned by 14 families. I was broke and needed money to pay for my wife's early alzheimer's. Our bio son, Jaden, had been in prison for statutory rape, so it's not like we had other responsibilities. Theo moved in on a Thursday afternoon with one garbage bag of belongings and eyes that dared me to reject him. I showed him Jaden's old room, rattling off the rules like terms of a lease. He nodded once and disappeared behind the door. For weeks, we were just strangers sharing walls. He'd leave before my 5:00am alarm, and I'd come home at nine PM to find him already locked away, only the thin line of light under his door proving he existed. One afternoon, I heard the Arctic Monkeys blasting through his headphones while I made coffee. I told him it was my favorite band and we the music from Alexa instead. When I went grocery shopping, I picked up his favorite Celsius flavor without being asked. We developed a perfect rhythm without needing to talk. By month three, he knew me better than most of my coworkers. He'd replace my coffee pods before it ran out, so I'd make extra portions of dinner for when he felt like snacking. Almost like a real Family. If you squint. Then I got the call. You need to come get your wife. She's crazy. I found rose two blocks away in her thin nightgown, bare feet bleeding on the concrete. When I tried to wrap my jacket around her, she clawed at my face. Don't touch me! Where's my son? What did you do with my son? My heart shattered. The emts arrived and tried to grab her arms, but she fought harder, animal sounds coming from her throat I'd never heard before. That's when Theo appeared from the darkness. Fill in yesterday's clothes like he'd been awake all night. He started humming something I didn't recognize. Low and steady, like a heartbeat. Rose's whole body changed. The wild fear drained from her face as she turned toward the sound. My baby, she whispered, reaching out with shaking hands. You came back to me. Theo kept humming while walking closer, palms out where she could see them, moving like water. It's okay, missus K, he said in this soft voice I'd never heard. Like he'd done this before. Wanna go home? I'll make you tea. She grabbed his hand like a lifeline. The EMTs let him ride in the ambulance. He sat next to her gurney, thumb tracing circles on her palm, humming whenever her breathing quickened. By the time we hit the ER, she was calm enough. They skipped the restraints. The doctor pulled me aside near the vending machines, his voice low. If that Kid hadn't calmed her down, we would have been forced to put her in an involuntary hold. I turned to look at Theo, but he didn't say anything. Instead, he pulled out the spiral notebook I'd always seen him carrying. As he. I flipped through, my heart throbbed. Each page was filled with documentation on my wife's progress. All those mornings I'd found her peaceful in bed, thinking the new meds were working. It was him. We brought rose home as the sun came up. I went to make coffee, hands still shaking, and noticed the kitchen trash overflowing. I pulled the bag out and envelope spilled everywhere. M I T, Stanford, Burk play. All college acceptances. All dated exactly three months ago. Right when her night terrors started. They were too far from here, was all he said when I asked. That's when I knew this kid wasn't placement anymore. He was family. A week later, my phone rang. Jade

My best friend Ford had the craziest parents. Last year, when he got an 89 on a pre test, they completely lost it. They blamed his social life and said, you're not allowed to take one step out of this house except for school. No exceptions. And they weren't kidding. He literally wasn't allowed to go to birthday parties, field trips, or even study groups. Saying, your friends are distractions. From now on, you focus only on academics. I tried to convince them that none of those things were a distraction, but they refused to listen. So when I handed Ford an invitation to my birthday, he handed it back with a deep frown. Sorry. You know, they'd never let me go. The whole not a single, single step out of this house rule, remember? But that's when my friend Logan had an idea. Then let's just carry you out. We stared at him, thinking it was the most ridiculous thing we'd heard. But when you fight crazy with crazier. Well, it was worth a shot. So we showed up to Ford's door for the first time with our first attempt, a rolling office chair. I rang the doorbell and took a deep breath. Good afternoon. Ford's wonderful parents need Ford for a group project. Oh, no. He strictly can't take one step out of the house. Yes, we know. So he won't. Ford grinned, seeing Us through the doorway and quickly leapt onto the office chair. He'll be in this seat the entire time. Not one step. Ford's parents stared like it was the stupidest thing they'd ever heard. But they couldn't exactly argue against it, either. So Ford rolled all the way to my birthday party. The next time we showed up, his mom instantly said, no rolling chairs allowed. Logan shrugged. Already prepared. Two other guys popped out from the bushes and helped us literally carry Ford out on our shoulders, like they do in funerals, but without the CAS. Get. You said he can't leave. We're removing him. That's the same thing, she argued. No, no. This is involuntary relocation. We kept switching up tactics. Every time, a new part of the rule got added. Can't exit the house through any doorway. We brought a ladder to his window and transported him away with a shopping cart. Can't leave without a chaperone. We printed out a cardboard cut out of his dad and carried that around, too. At some point, Ford managed to leave the house to go bowling with us just by dressing up in a costume and saying, well, I'm not Ford right now. I'm Iron Man. Unfortunately, that was the final straw. After his last stunt, Ford got completely grounded. No door, no phone, no anything. It's over. They won, I said, feeling down that he wasn't even able to go to the class's end of the year party. But Logan wasn't ready to give up. Logan gathered everyone and said, if Ford can't leave, I say we bring the party to Ford. Everyone cheered at the idea, and honestly, it was the best one he had yet. So that Saturday night, 30 of us showed up at once, carrying around our world history textbooks. Study group. Ford answered the door with a shocked expression. My parents just stepped out. What are you guys doing here? We grinned. Welcome to the end of the year party, bro. We instantly set up for the party. Disco ball hanging from the living room ceiling fan, set up a small DJ counter in the kitchen, and pulled out all the food and snacks.

My fiance Rebecca really picked the worst time to call me paranoid about her ex, Nate. We were literally sitting there tasting wedding cakes when she brought it up. She kept insisting they were just friends now and I was being controlling. The thing was, I'd come home early from a work trip last week and saw his car leaving our apartment complex at 2:00am. She had no idea I'd seen it. Every time his name popped up on her phone, she'd flip it face down real quick. When she called me insecure again, I decided to call her bluff. You're right. I'm being unfair. Let's invite Nate to your parents anniversary dinner next week, I said. I watched all the color drain from her face. She tried to backtrack, saying her family wouldn't want extra guests at their special dinner, but I pushed harder. I'll call in myself to show I trust you. She was trapped and we both knew it. She agreed, but her hands were literally shaking that night. I called Nate and made sure to put him on speaker so Rebecca could hear everything. I told him I wanted to apologize for being the jealous boyfriend and invited him to the family dinner. Rebecca just sat there watching me, completely stuck. He tried to turn me down, that it wasn't a good idea, but I Kept pushing, telling him Rebecca really wanted him there. I even offered to pick him up myself, you know, to show there were no hard feelings. When I picked him up that night, the guy was sweating through his dress shirt. During the drive, he mentioned Rebecca's parents hated him, but wouldn't tell me why. We walked into that dinner together, and I swear, the whole room just froze. Rebecca's mom dropped her wine glass, and it shattered all over the floor. Her dad's face went from normal to purple in about two seconds. What is he doing here? He practically growled. I played innocent and explained I'd invited Rebecca's friend to make peace. Her sister actually laughed out loud. Friends? After what he did to her? Right then, Rebecca's phone lit up on the table. A text from Nate popped up on the screen. This was a mistake. We should be more careful. Everyone saw it. Her sister snatched the phone before Rebecca could grab it. More messages were right there on the lock screen. Meeting time last night was amazing. And what looked like photos being sent back and forth. Her dad jumped up so fast, his chair fell backwards. You're seeing him again. Nate was already heading for the door. Rebecca ran after him, begging him to wait. That's when her family just exploded. Her mom started telling me how Nate had cheated. Did. On Rebecca years ago with her own roommate. He'd lied about it for Six months straight, the whole family had been there for Rebecca through that nightmare of a breakup. And now she was sneaking around with him again. Two months before our wedding, Rebecca came back inside with her makeup running down her face. Her family looked at her like she was a stranger. They kept telling me story after story about what Nate had put her through. How could you

Four years later, I found them in our bed three days before our wedding. My fiance Jessica, and her stepbrother, Braden. She didn't even try to explain. Just looked at me and said, I love him. Her engagement ring was still on. While she held his hand, Braden smirked. Sorry, man. It just happened. Their parents had married two years ago. At night, Jessica posted photos with Braden like nothing happened. Changed her relationship status. While our wedding vendors were still calling me. I had to cancel everything alone. The venue, the flowers, the honeymoon. Each call was humiliation. The hotel manager asked, if is the bride okay? I couldn't even answer. But I turned that rage into purpose. Studied for the bar exam like my life depended on it. Passed first try. Got hired as a paralegal at a family law firm. My job? Research custody cases and find evidence. My boss said I had unusual drive. I had unusual motivation. While I Learned every detail about custody battles and what makes a parent unfit. Jessica and Braden played house. A daughter posted family photos online. Their parents barely visited, but they insisted their love was worth it. I became the firm's best researcher. The paralegal who found evidence that won cases. Lawyers requested me for their hardest custody battles. I knew exactly what judges looked for, what evidence mattered, how to prove someone was lying about being A good parent. Three years in, I was the go to person for impossible cases. I turned my pain into expert peace. While Jessica and Braden raised their daughter, I became an expert at determining who deserved to keep their kids. Life has a strange sense of humor. Four years later, Braden walked into my firm. I was in the conference room, and I heard his voice at reception, desperate, explaining how Jessica wanted full custody of their daughter. My boss knocked. Can you handle this case? Do the research? I almost said no. Then curiosity one. Braden looked destroyed. Didn't recognize me at first. I changed. Lost weight, expensive suit, different hairstyle. He was too focused on his problem. She's saying I'm an unfit father, that our relationship was wrong from the start. Then he really looked at me. His face went white. Your. Oh, god. Started to leave, but my boss insisted. Please sit. We're here to help. Braden slumped back down, kept glancing at me while explaining Jessica had cheated with her trainer, now wanted their daughter. Was telling the court Braden wasn't a good father, that their relationship had been unhealthy. The irony was perfect. She'd left me for him. Now she was leaving him and trying to take their child. My boss assured Braden, we take the case. Braden didn't realize I'd be building the entire case, finding every piece of evidence that would determine if he kept his daughter. I spent three weeks investigating Found Jessica's texts to friends bragging about her trainer. Discovered she'd been leaving their daughter with babysitters constantly. Located witnesses who saw Braden at every school event while Jessica was at the gym. Built a file proving who the real parent was. At the custody hearing, I sat at the lawyer's table organizing evidence. Jessica walked in confident until

My mom clinked her fork against her glass and stood up. Before we sing Happy Birthday to my daughter, I want everyone to know we're also celebrating Moira's half birthday today. My 16 year old sister Moira bounced up from her chair and rushed to stand behind my birthday cake, giggling. Another birthday stolen right in front of me. It's my 18th birthday, I said. Can I have just this one birthday for myself? Mom stared daggers at me. Don't be selfish. Birthdays are meant for sharing, and we do this every year. Dad added. Why are you suddenly making it a problem? But that was exactly the problem. Every year I had to deal with my parents putting Moira first. And sure, it was cute back when Moira was three and I was five. I mean, who wouldn't say all when your toddler sister helps blow out your candles for the first time? But that was the thing. We were kids. But that cute incident didn't stop there. During Christmas, my parents let her tear open her gifts first before turning around and opening mine, too. You're too old to be excited with opening presents anyway, mom said. I was 8. My 10th birthday dinner was at Chuck E. Cheese instead of the Japanese restaurant I wanted. All because Moira threw a tantrum about wanting pizza. My 12th birthday got canceled when Moira woke up with a really bad Tummy ache. Which happened to suddenly disappear an hour after telling everyone not to show up. And on my 16th birthday, my parents forgot all about it. So this year was really it. I was an adult and didn't have to put up with their crap any longer. I looked down at my birthday cake, with Moira's name written beautifully and mine squeezed into the bottom corner in sloppy letters, completely misspelt, and just lost it. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear! I blew out the candles right there. Every single one. Before Moira could make her move, the singing instantly fell apart. Every person in the room went completely silent. What the heck? Moira shrieked. Why did you blow out my cake? Our cake! I said with a smile. I grabbed the presents my parents neatly wrapped on the side for my sister and ripped open the first box. AirPods! Wow! I've been asking for this for four years! Those are Moira's half birthday presents. Mom stood up so fast, her chair scraped against the floor. Exactly. I can't wait to share it. I opened another box. Oh, A Lululemon gift card! Thanks so much! I carefully opened the rest of my gifts, making snarky comments like, oh, Moira! This isn't the color Moira likes. Guess I'll just keep it for myself. You don't mind, right, Moira? All the guests stared at her. Moira started crying, real tears streaming down her face. She's ruining everything! Make her stop! This is what we always do, I said, staying perfectly calm. I don't understand why you're upset. Dad's face turned red. You're going too far. This is cruel. Too far? I looked at him. This is exactly what happens at every birthday of mine. The only difference is I'm not allowed to cry about it. Mom's voice cracked, horrified by the sudden public exposure. You're older, you should know better. So when I was five and she was three, I should have known better? You're ruining her special moment, dad said, grabbing the AirPods out of my hands. Her special moment! I burst out into laughter, pointing to the. Hey, this is my birthday! Moira is quite literally 4 months away. Funny how all this sharing stuff only applies when it's my birthday. I mean, go ahead, name one time Moira had to share her party. No

Mason threw industrial cleaning solution in my mother's face during what was supposed to be my college graduation dinner. The restaurant erupted into absolute chaos as my mother collapsed, screaming while her skin literally bubbled and peeled away from her skull. I couldn't move, couldn't breathe, couldn't comprehend what Mason had just done. My father tackled him to the ground, punching him repeatedly. I wanted to scream, but my throat wouldn't work as I watched my mother's face dissolve. He's been stealing Beatrice's identity for three years, Mason shouted while trying to shield himself from my father's fists as two of my uncles jumped in to help restrain him, all of them slipping in, the blood spreading across the floor. She's been using their identical resemblance to drain her bank accounts. I was barely listening. My legs gave out and I crashed into a chair. But my father hesitated for just a second, his fist raised in the air, and Mason spit blood onto the floor while my mother rolled and thrashed, knocking over chairs and leaving smears of flesh on everything she touched. I have video of her at five different banks, he yelled over my mother's inhuman screaming, holding the screen up while my uncle twisted his arm. I noticed discrepancies in Beatrice's accounts when we were apartment hunting and installed tracking software. And I've caught her mother stealing $40,000. My mother writhed on the floor and tried to speak. But only managed to spray blood across the white tablecloth while her face continued to dissolve. And even through the destroyed flesh, I could see something in that look that made my stomach drop. Because it wasn't Niall. It was rage at being caught. Those accounts are family money! She finally shrieked through her melted mouth the words. Barely human mom, I whispered, but I couldn't hear my own voice over the chaos of people screaming and crying and calling 9 1 1, while my mother's face kept bubbling and peeling like plastic in a fire. My father grabbed the phone from Mason with hands covered in my mother's blood and skin, staring at the screen where my mother was clearly at an ATM wearing my clothes, and his face went white. Linda, you've been stealing from our daughter? He asked while she convulsed on the floor, her screaming never stopping. She owes me everything! My mother managed to hiss between streaks of agony, blood and tissue dripping onto the floor. I gave up my career to raise her. The other diners were pressed against the walls, filming everything, while the manager was vomiting in the corner and servers were sobbing. And I felt like I was drowning because my own mother had been systematically destroying my future while her face was literally falling off in front of me. You destroy her face over money! My father shouted at Mason, releasing him and stumbling backward, slipping in the puddle of Blood and chemicals. Even if she stole from Beatrice, you threw acid at my wife. Mason wiped blood from his broken nose and looked directly at me with an expression that made my blood freeze. That's not why I had to destroy her face. Everyone went silent except for my mother's whimpering and the sound of her skin sizzling, and I heard myself ask, what do you mean? That's not why I followed her to a P O. Box yesterday, Mason said quietly. Check her purse. My mother started, shrieking even louder and trying to crawl toward her bag, leaving a trail of dissolved flesh. But my father got there first and dumped it onto the floor, where a small glass vial rolled out. That's Wrayson, Mason said, his voice deadly calm.

So I moved across the country for my dream job. But six months later, she showed up at my door, saying, I'm ready to commit now, because distance doesn't matter when it's real love. And I laughed before introducing her to my new fiance, who was cooking dinner in our kitchen. I'm Marcus, 26, and when Jess dumped me six months ago, she said I was emotionally unavailable and socially stunted. Her exact words. You hide behind your work and can't form real connections. I need someone who actually has friends and knows how to be vulnerable. This happened right after I got accepted to my dream veterinary residency in Denver. We've been together two years, and I thought we were solid. I was planning to propose that Christmas, even had the ring picked out. The breakup destroyed me. I spent three days eating cereal in bed, questioning everything. Was I really that disconnected? Maybe she was right. Maybe I was just using her as a placeholder while focusing on my career. But I'd committed to the residency. So I packed up and drove to Denver with just my clothes, textbook, and a broken heart. If I was going to be miserable, at least I'd do something I loved. The animal hospital was this busy emergency clinic downtown. Doctor Peterson put me on 12 hour Shifts immediately. I was so exhausted learning new procedures that I barely thought about Jess. Something unexpected happened, though. My colleague Mike kept inviting me to trivia night at this dive bar. I made excuses. Too tired, had studying. But Mike was persistent, and I finally gave in just to shut him up. Trivia night was actually fun. Mike's team called themselves the Possum 4 and competed against other medical professionals. I was weirdly good at Animal Facts, making me valuable for the first time in months. I was laughing and genuinely enjoying people's company. Mike introduced me to his hiking group. Outdoorsy medical people doing weekend trails around Colorado. I'd always loved nature, but never had anyone to explore with. Suddenly, I was spending Saturdays climbing mountains and having real conversations with people who weren't. Just then I started volunteering at the city animal shelter on days off. They needed someone with medical training for health assessments. That's where I met Diana. She was the shelter coordinator, this amazing woman who knew every single animal's personality and history. She'd work late with difficult rescue cases, and I started staying to help with medical check UPS. We talked for hours about each animal's progress and recovery stories. Diana had this gift for seeing potential in every broken creature. She was patient, compassionate, incredibly smart about animal behavior. Three months later, we went on our first date to a dog friendly brewery where half our shelter animals had been adopted. We Spent the evening pointing out our kids and discussing dreams of opening our own rescue. Focused practice with Diana. Conversation felt effortless. We could talk about work, family, random thoughts. Everything flowed naturally. I'd never experienced that easy connection, even with Jess. Diana actually listened when I talked about cases. Last month, I proposed at the same dog park where we had our first date. I brought three shelter dogs, each wearing part of the message on their collars. Diana cried and said yes before

So I've been helping my older sister Brisa, plan her wedding since the day she got engaged. We're talking eight months of venue tours, cake tastings, and color swatching. Every shade of lush pink known to mankind. She called me her angel sister to everyone, bragging about how she couldn't imagine doing any of this without me. We spent every Sunday together working on centerpieces, addressing invitations, making those little favor bag. Never once did we argue about anything. Then, two weeks before her big day, we're at the final bridesmaid dress fitting downtown. I step out of the dressing room in this dusty rose dress she picked, and I watch her face just completely change. She goes quiet for the rest of the appointment, barely looks at me. That night, I'm meal prepping for the week when my phone rings. We need to talk about the wedding, she says, and her voice is ice cold. I'm thinking maybe there's a vendor issue or something. Then she hits me with, you're out of the wedding party. Actually, don't even come to the wedding at all. She tells me I looked too good in the bridesmaid dress, and she won't have me stealing attention on her special day. I literally laughed because I thought she was joking. We're sisters. I offered to wear a different dress, do my hair different, wear less makeup. Literally anything. But she's Dead serious. This is my wedding and my day. I don't want you there. I could have fought her on it. Could have called our parents, made it into this whole family drama. But honestly, if she really felt that threatened by me just existing in a bridesmaid dress, then fine. I told her, okay, if that's what you want. She sounded surprised, like she expected me to beg or cry or something. That night, I started going through all my emails. Every vendor communication is in my inbox because I'm the one who's been handling everything. The venue, that's my boss's country club, and he gave us the friends and family discount. The florist, she's a client from my job. The photographer, charging $2,000 instead of his usual six thousand dollars. I designed his entire website portfolio for free last year. The caterer, the DJ, the bartenders, even the hair and makeup team. They're all doing this as favors to me, not her. My sister has no idea that every single contract is technically under my name. The next morning, I called Brisa one more time. Just so you know, if I'm not part of the wedding, I'll need to cancel all the arrangements I made through my connections. She immediately snaps back, good, I don't want anything from you. Anyway, she hung up before I could say anything. I don't think she had any clue what that meant. I spent the rest of that day making calls. First The venue. I explained that I won't be attending the wedding anymore, so I need to cancel the reservation I made. My boss is confused but says no problem. Next. The florist. She's actually offended when I tell her what happened and says she wouldn't work with my sister now even if she begged. The photographer is booked solid and happily takes another wedding for that date at his full rate. One by one, I cancel everything. The caterer, the DJ, the Baker who was doing a five tier for the price of three. I also canceled the two surprises I planned as a gift. I've been secretly paying for the premium open bar package and upgraded their honeymoon suite to the penthouse.

Growing up, my dad had one phrase that he loved. My house, my rules. When I was 16 and wanted to dye my hair purple for junior year, he stood in the bathroom doorway, blocking my path. Not under my roof, Alexis. You want purple hair, get your own place. When my boyfriend asked me to prom, dad made him sit through a two hour interrogation before declaring, no dating until you're 18. My house, my rules. I couldn't even watch P G. 13 movies until. Till I was 17 because inappropriate content isn't welcome under my roof. My friends stopped coming over after dad made them sign a behavioral contract to enter our home. He controlled what I wore. No ripped jeans in my house. You look homeless. What I ate. Vegetarian phase. Not at my dinner table. And my opinions, too. You don't get to disagree with me while you're living rent free. When I got accepted to art school, he laughed. Art degree? Not with my money. You'll study business or nothing. Mom would whisper apologies when he wasn't looking, but never stood up to him. The worst part was his favorite closing line whenever I protested. When you have your own place, you can do whatever you want. Don't like it? There's the door. He'd literally point to the front door, knowing I had nowhere to go. At 17, with $82 in My saving account. Life isn't fair, Princess. The person who pays the bills makes the rules. Remember that. Well, I took student loans and went to art school anyway, living in a studio apartment with three roommates and a family of roaches. Dad called it learning life a hard way. Should have listened to me about that business degree, he'd say during Sunday dinners while I was building my graphic design portfolio at 3 a m. Dad was getting comfortable in early retirement at 55, spending his days watching Fox News and calling me to criticize my lifestyle choices. Still living in that dump? He'd ask. Still single because you're too picky? Still wasting time on those computer drawings? His words hurt, but I kept going. Meanwhile, his perfect life started cracking. Mom finally left him after 30 years, tired of the controlling behavior. She's going through menopause, he told everyone, refusing to admit she'd simply had enough. Then his health declined, and he got diabetes from decades of my house, my beer choices. He even refused to take his medications properly because no doctor tells me what to do in my own home. Next, his house started falling apart, with the roof leaking and the foundation cracking. But he was too proud to ask for help and too cheap to hire anyone. I built this house. I'll maintain it my way. By the time I landed my senior design director position, making six figures at 29, Dad was 67 Living alone in a deteriorating house, alienated from most family members and struggling with basic tasks, but still preaching about his rules whenever anyone would listen. Then one day, my phone rang and his name popped up. Alexis. How's my successful daughter? Red Flag already? He never spoke that nicely. What do you need, dad? Can't a father call his daughter? You only call when you want something. Long pause. The house is getting to be too much. Your mother used to handle things, but now she's gone. I was thinking maybe I could stay with you for a while. I knew this was coming. He'd been posting on Facebook about his struggles, fishing for sympathy. But I wasn't going to just refuse because I had a secret plan. So I told him, of course you can stay with me. Dad. I have a sweet. His voice brightened immediately. Good. It's your duty as my daughter. I almost burst out laughing. Sure, dad, but I need to explain the house rules. What rules? Well, my house, my rules, remember? His voice turned sour immediately. Alexis, you can't be serious. Dead serious. First, visiting hours are 10 a m. To 8 p m. I work from home and need quiet. No Fox News. It's too negative for my workspace. Breakfast is at 7, lunch at noon, dinner at 6. Bedtime is 9 p m. Because I don't want to hear T V. After that, I heard his voice crack, and he Became super angry. This is ridiculous! You can't impose rules on me.

My best friend Ford had the craziest parents. Last year, when he got an 89 on a pre test, they completely lost it. They blamed his social life and said, you're not allowed to take one step out of this house except for school. No exceptions. And they weren't kidding. He literally wasn't allowed to go to birthday parties, field trips, or even study groups. Saying, your friends are distractions. From now on, you focus only on academics. I tried to convince them that none of those things were a distraction, but they refused to listen. So when I handed Ford an invitation to my birthday, he handed it back with a deep frown. Sorry. You know, they'd never let me go. The whole not a single step out of this house rule, remember? But that's when my friend Logan had an idea. Then let's just carry you out. We stared at him, thinking it was the most ridiculous thing we'd heard. But when you fight crazy with crazier. Well, it was worth a shot. So we showed up to Ford's door for the first time with our first attempt, a rolling office chair. I rang the doorbell and took a deep breath. Good afternoon, Ford's wonderful parents. I need Ford for a group project. Oh, no. He strictly can't take one step out of the house. Yes, we know. So he won't. Ford grinned, seeing Us through the doorway and quickly leapt onto the office chair. He'll be in this seat the entire time. Not one step. Ford's parents stared like it was the stupidest thing they'd ever heard. But they couldn't exactly argue against it, either. So Ford rolled all the way to my birthday party. The next time we showed up, his mom instantly said, no rolling chairs allowed. Logan shrugged. Already prepared. Two other guys popped out from the bushes and helped us literally carry Ford out on our shoulders, like they do in funerals, but without the casket. You said he can't leave. We're removing him. That's the same thing, she argued. No, no. This is involuntary relocation. We kept switching up tactics. Every time, a new part of the rule got added. Can't exit the house through any doorway. We brought a ladder to his window and transported him away with a shopping cart. Can't leave without a chaperone. I printed out a cardboard cut out of his dad and carried that around, too. At some point, Ford managed to leave the house to go bowling with us just by dressing up in a costume and saying, well, I'm not Ford right now. I'm Iron Man. Unfortunately, that was the final straw. After his last stunt, Ford got completely grounded. No door, no phone, no anything. It's over. They won, I said, feeling down that he wasn't even able to go to the class. This is end of the year. Party! But Logan wasn't ready to give up. Logan gathered everyone and said, if Ford can't leave, I say we bring the party to Ford. Everyone cheered at the idea, and honestly, it was the best one he had yet. So that Saturday night, 30 of us showed up at once, carrying around our world history textbooks. Study group. Ford answered the door with a shocked expression. My parents just stepped out. What are you guys doing here? We grinned. Welcome to the end of the year party, bro. We instantly set up for the party. Disco ball hanging from the living room ceiling fan. Set up a small DJ counter in the kitchen and pulled out all the food and snack. Next in the fridge and pantry. The entire house became a party. Kids were dancing while holding textbooks. Someone started a conga line through the kitchen. The base was shaking family photos off the walls. When Ford's parents got back home, their faces drained of color, instantly watching a bunch of kids go wild.

I knew dating Rachel meant getting past her three older brothers, but I had no idea they'd turned protecting her into a military operation. She'd been with a guy named Jeff for two years, and he'd broken her jaw when she tried to leave him. So now her brothers treated every man who looked at her like a potential threat. The first time I picked her up for dinner, her oldest brother answered the door holding a baseball bat like he was stepping up to home plate. The middle brother stood behind him, cracking his knuckles, while the youngest just stared at me, taking photos with his phone, probably for some criminal database they were building. Rachel pushed past them, looking mortified, but I caught the oldest one mouthing, we're watching you. As we walked to my car. They threw literally everything at me to see if I'd crack or run away screaming. Every restaurant we went to, somehow one brother would already be there, pretending to read a menu upside down while photographing my every move. During our third date, the youngest brother actually sat down at our table uninvited and said, so what exactly are your intentions with our sister? Because we've got shovels, and we know how to use them. Instead of getting angry, I looked him straight in the eye and said, my intention is to never give you a reason to Use them, which made him blink first. They ran background checks and left the results on my windshield with certain thing circled in red marker like a teacher grading papers. The middle brother created a fake Instagram profile as a woman named Jessica and sent me messages trying to get me to cheat, but I just screenshot everything and sent them to Rachel saying, your brother needs to work on his catfishing skills because Jessica types exactly like him. When they followed us to the movies, I bought them popcorn and had the usher deliver it to their seats with a note saying next time just join us instead of lurking, which actually made the youngest one laugh. I started leaving gift cards for coffee on their trucks. I spotted them tailing us with notes like stalking must be exhausting, so caffeine's on me, and eventually the oldest brother actually used one. The breakthrough came when I showed up at their mother's birthday even though Rachel warned me they'd told me the wrong time on purpose. I arrived three hours early with flowers for their mom and helped her cook while she told me embarrassing stories about all four of her kids. By the time everyone else arrived, I was wearing her apron and knew about the time the oldest brother cried watching The Lion King at age 16. He pulled me aside later and said that was sneaky as hell, but he was almost smiling when he said It. After two months of this dance, where I matched every test with patience and humor, the middle brother finally asked me directly, why haven't you given up yet? We've broken seven guys before you. I told him the truth. That Rachel was worth whatever bizarre hazing ritual they needed to put me through. The real test came during Rachel's company holiday party, when I stepped outside for air and found all three brothers waiting by my car. The oldest one stepped forward and said, she's getting attached, and we need to know if you're going to hurt her. Before I could answer, we heard Rachel scream from the parking garage and saw her backing away from a man I recognized from photos as Jeff, who'd been released early for good behavior.

My mom clinked her fork against her glass and stood up. Before we sing Happy Birthday to my daughter, I want everyone to know we're also celebrating Moira's half birthday today. My 16 year old sister Moira bounced up from her chair and rushed to stand behind my birthday cake, giggling. Another birthday stolen right in front of me. It's my 18th birthday, I said. Can I have just this one birthday for myself? Mom stared daggers at me. Don't be selfish. Birthdays are meant for sharing, and we do this every year. Dad added, why are you suddenly making it a problem? But that was exactly the problem. Every year I had to deal with my parents putting Moira first. And sure, it was cute back when Moira was three and I was five. I mean, who wouldn't say all when your toddler sister helps blow out your candles for the first time? But that was the thing. We were kids. But that cute incident didn't stop there. During Christmas, my parents let her tear open her gifts first before turning around and opening mine too. You're too old to be excited with opening presents anyway, mom said. I was 8. My 10th birthday dinner was at Chuck E. Cheese instead of the Japanese restaurant I wanted. All because Moira threw a tantrum about wanting pizza. My 12th birthday got canceled when Moira woke up with a really bad tummy. Ache which happened to suddenly disappear an hour after telling everyone not to show up. And on my 16th birthday, my parents forgot all about it. So this year was really it. I was an adult and didn't have to put up with their crap any longer. I looked down at my birthday cake, with Moira's name written beautifully and mine squeezed into the bottom corner in sloppy letters, completely misspelled, and just lost it. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear! I blew out the candles right there. Every single one. Before Moira could make her move, the singing instantly fell apart. Every person in the room went completely silent. What the heck? Moira shrieked. Why'd you blow out my cake? Our cake! I said with a smile. I grabbed the presents my parents neatly wrapped on the side for my sister and ripped open the first box. AirPods! Wow! I've been asking for this for four years! Those are Moira's half birthday presents. Mom stood up so fast, her chair scraped against the floor. Exactly! I can't wait to share it. I opened another box. Ooh, a Lululemon gift card! Thanks so much! I carefully opened the rest of my gifts, making snarky comments like, oh, Moira, this isn't the color Moira likes. Guess I'll just keep it for myself. You don't mind, right, Moira? All the guests stared at her. Moira started crying, real tears streaming down her face. She's ruining everything! Make her stop! This is What we always do. I said. Stay perfectly calm. I don't understand why you're upset. Dad's face turned red. You're going too far. This is cruel. Too far? I looked at him. This is exactly what happens at every birthday of mine. The only difference is I'm not allowed to cry about it. Mom's voice cracked, horrified by the sudden public exposure. You're older. You should know better. So when I was five and she was three, I should have known better? You're ruining her special moment, dad said, grabbing the AirPods out of my hands. Her special moment? I burst out into laughter, pointing to the cake. This is my birthday. Moira is quite literally four months away. Funny how all this sharing stuff only applies when it's my birthday. I mean, go ahead. And one time Moira had to share her party. Nothing. Complete silence. Yeah, that's what I thought. Last year, her Sweet 16 had a professional photographer. The year before, you rented the country club. Before that, the pool party with a DJ. When has she ever had to share? I grabbed a cake cutter and started slicing up pieces and placing them on paper plates to hand out to guests.

I said, fair enough, and quietly canceled our 85,000 dollar wedding. Her face went pale when she got the cancellation notice. I'm watching my ex fiance Bianca blow up my phone right now. She just found out I canceled our entire wedding that was supposed to happen in 4 months. See, I own a tech consulting firm that's done pretty well. Not yacht money, but comfortable. She's an influencer making maybe 30 k a year. When we got engaged last year after dating for three years, she immediately went into wedding planning overdrive. Not just any wedding. Her dream wedding. Historic estate venue for $15,000. Catering for 250 guests at $30,000. Flowers for $8,000. Photographer and videographer for $10,000. Her dress for $12,000. Live band for $6,000. The list kept going. Total damage 80 $5,000. I was fine with it initially. I loved her, wanted her happy, had the money saved. But then my lawyer friend Garrett pulled me aside at a barbecue. Yo, you getting a prenup? Haven't thought about it. Dude, you own a business. You need one. If she's cool, no harm done. So I brought it up that night casually. Hey, Garrett mentioned we should probably do a prenup. Standard stuff for business owners. The temperature in the room dropped in. You think I'm a gold digger? Bianca snapped. No, it's just standard legal Protection. If you loved me, you'd trust me. I do trust You. This is just. I'll sign a prenup when hell freezes over. Bianca, be reasonable. You be reasonable. We're supposed to be partners. What's yours is ours, but what's mine is. Well, you know, I don't have money like you. Don't be ridiculous. God, why are you being so cheap? Stormed off. I figured she needed time to cool down. Nope. Next day, she told her whole family I was financially abusing her by asking for a prenup. Her mom, Deedee, called, screaming, how dare you insult my daughter like this? I asked for a standard prenup. That's not an insult. She's giving you the best years of her life. She's 28, not 80. And I'm giving her mine, too. A real man doesn't need contracts with his wife. Click. She hung up on me. Bianca came back that evening, acting like nothing happened. Started showing me centerpiece options. We need to resolve the prenup thing first. I said. There's nothing to resolve. I'm not signing it now. Roses or peonies? Bianca, I'm serious. So am I. Drop it or there won't be a wedding. Okay, good. So, peonies? Sure, whatever you want. She smiled, thinking she'd won. Started talking about napkin colors and chair sashes. I smiled and nodded, but went bed thinking. Woke up knowing exactly what I had to do the next morning. I started making calls. Not dramatic ones, just practical ones. First, the venue explained I needed to cancel due to irreconcilable differences that have Emerged. They were surprisingly cool. Apparently this happens more than you'd think. Got 60% of my deposit back since it was over 120 days out. Next, the caterer. Same story. 50% back. Photographer actually gave me 100% back because he'd already booked another wedding for that date at a higher rate. Solid dude. Bam and florist. Everyone one by one, quietly canceled. Didn't tell Bianca. Didn't tell anyone except my best friend Marcus, who thought I was either genius or insane. Meanwhile, Bianca was in full bridezilla mode. Created a wedding Instagram, posted daily about becoming Mrs. My last name, and can't wait to marry my provider. Yeah, that post told me everything.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We'd known each other since freshman year. And when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything, 50 50, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird serious face she starts with. So I've been thinking and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. But she's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue because honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I tell her, fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realize I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says, okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the TV and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realised she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that really made me laugh. When I was packing up the kitchen stuff, I realised I'd bought all the cooking supplies too, the pans, the good knife set, even the can opener. I left her with basically nothing except a mini fridge and some random cups she had from high school. By the time I finished loading everything, the apartment looked like nobody had ever lived there, just empty rooms with some random junk scattered around that wasn't worth taking. I drive to my new place. Feeling pretty good about myself. I'm unpacking when my phone starts blowing up. First it's texts, then calls. Megan is absolutely losing it. What the hell did you do to the apartment? She screams. When I finally pick up, it's completely empty. I tell her calmly that I took everything I paid for, just like I said I would. She she starts yelling about how she looks like an idiot because her friends were supposed to come over that night and now there's nowhere to sit and nothing to watch. You can't just take everything, she says. How am I supposed to explain this? I remind her that she literally said okay when I told her I was taking my stuff. She hangs up on me.

But she didn't know I'd had a vasectomy last year. When Amanda told me she was pregnant, I should have been thrilled. Instead, my blood ran cold. See, 18 months ago, after a pregnancy scare with my ex. Got a vasectomy. Amanda had no idea. She immediately started house hunting, sending me listings for 800 k homes. Way above our budget. The baby needs a yard, Matthew. We can't raise a family in this apartment. Her voice had this urgent, almost desperate edge I'd never heard before. I played along perfectly. Nodded at open houses, discussed mortgage rates, even met with realtors. But I was really gathering evidence. Something felt off about her sudden pregnancy announcement. Immediate push for home ownership. I remembered her work conference nine weeks ago, the exact conception window. Checked her Instagram from that weekend. Every photo featured her coworker Luke. His arm around her, intimate smiles. Definitely not just colleagues. They looked way too comfortable together. The more I dug, the worse it got. I found receipts for romantic dinners during that conference. Weekend hotel charges for room service for two, even a spa booking for couples massage. She documented her entire affair without realizing it. For seven months. I was the perfect supportive boyfriend. Went to doctor appointments where I watched her lie to medical professionals. Helped. And the baby shower? Picking out decorations while she texted Luke constantly. Even picked Out paint colors for the nursery, pretending to be excited about becoming a father. During this time, Amanda ramped up the house pressure. She scheduled multiple tours every weekend, each property more expensive than the last. Her parents got involved, offering to co sign loans. She had me meet with financial advisors about stretching our budget. The manipulation was masterful. I started noticing Luke everywhere. He'd show up at our grocery store, our coffee shop, even our gym. Amanda always acted surprised to see him, but I could tell these weren't coincidences. They were meeting regularly, probably planning their future together. With my money. The pregnancy progressed, and so did her demands. She wanted a house in the best school district, with a finished basement for a playroom and a three car garage. Every conversation became about our future family's needs. She he tear up, talking about wanting to give our child the best life possible. She even dragged my parents into it. Called them crying about how worried she was about raising a baby in our small apartment. Showed them listings of beautiful homes with white picket fences. My mom started pressuring me, too, saying I needed to step up and provide for my growing family. The baby shower was packed. Entire family, our friends, co workers, including Luke, who looked nervous the whole time. He kept checking his phone, avoiding eye contact with me. Amanda was glowing, playing the perfect expectant mother role. I'd prepared everything carefully, made Copies of my vasectomy records, printed screenshots of her social media. Even had photos from the private investigator I'd hired. But I only needed one piece of evidence for maximum impact.

What do you mean? I gripped the door handle instinctively. Briggs had been on the force for 15 years and was supposed to be showing me the ropes. He had gray streaks in his hair and eyes that never seemed to blink. Don't worry. If you listen to every word I say, you'll walk out of this alive. He pulled the patrol car into a rundown neighborhood on the east side of town. Broken street lights and boarded windows made everything look abandoned. My training officer at the academy had warned me about Briggs but said he was one of the best cops on the force. Now I was starting to wonder what best meant. Briggs parked in front of a house that looked worse than the others, paint peeling off like dead skin, front steps rotting through. The kind of place where bad things happened and cops were too scared to show up. He turned to me with those unblinking eyes. Turn off your body cam. It wasn't a request. Why would I do that? My hand moved protectively to the camera on my chest. We're not supposed to ask questions, rookie. Just do it. His voice had an edge that made me comply. I pressed the button and watch the red light go dark. Everything we'd Learned in training said this was wrong. Body cams were for our Protection. In the publics, but Briggs was my partner and I needed this job. The student loans weren't going to pay themselves. Got out of the car and approached the house. Briggs moved like a predator stalking prey. Every step calculated, every movement deliberate. He pulled out his service weapon and I copied him, even though we hadn't knocked or announced ourselves. Turn off your safety and be ready for anything, he whispered it like we were already in danger. I clicked the safety off with sweaty fingers. This felt wrong, but Briggs had 15 years of experience. Maybe this was how real police work happened. Maybe the Amy was just theory and this was practice. My heart was pounding so hard, I was sure anyone inside could hear it. Briggs didn't knock. He just raised his boot and kicked the door in. It splintered inward with a crack and we rushed inside where everything was pitch black. No lights, no sounds, just darkness so thick it felt alive. The smell hit me first, mold and something else. My eyes tried to adjust, but there was nothing to see, just shapes that might have been furniture or might have been people. Riggs gestured for us to split up, which went against everything I'd Learned, but I was too scared to argue. I went left while he went right. My gun was shaking in my hands as I felt along the wall. Each step on the creaky floor sounded like an announcement. Here I am. Come get me. My breathing was too loud in the silence. Then Briggs screamed. Not a shout or a call for backup, a full throated scream of terror that made me cream. I ran toward the sound, bouncing off walls and tripping over things in the dark. His voice came from somewhere ahead, still screaming. Right there, shoot, shoot. Now I saw movement in the darkness. Shape.

I worked at McDonald's for three years and discovered the real reason the ice cream machine is always broken. It's not broken. It's rarely actually broken. It's a combination of deliberately terrible design, corporate contracts, and employees who've given up fighting a system designed to fail. But one summer, I decided to become the ice cream vigilante my store needed. And it nearly got me fired. The Taylor C602 ice cream machine is a nightmare. Wrapped in stainless steel, it's four hours to clean, and if you mess up even one step, it locks you out completely. The cleaning cycle must be done daily. But here's the kicker. It can only be done by someone trained on that specific machine. The training takes eight hours and cost the franchise owner $600 per employee. Most horses train one, maybe two people. So when Jeremy, our only trained ice cream technician, quit to focus on his Soundcloud career, our machine became permanently broken. The owner, Mister Chen, refused to pay for more training. Just tell customers it's broken, he said. Soft serve has the lowest profit margin anyway. For two months, I watched disappointed kids press their faces against the window, watching other people get ice cream at the Dairy Queen across the street. I watched elderly customers who driven specifically for a cone leave empty handed. One regular missus Patterson, came every Sunday for a vanilla cone after church. She'd stopped coming Altogether, I decided to fix this. I found the C602 manual online, all 296 pages of it. I studied it like my life depended on it. I watched YouTube videos of rogue McDonald's employees demonstrating the cleaning cycle. I Learned that Taylor, the manufacturer, had created a monopoly where only their technicians could repair the machines, charging franchises thousands for simple fixes. I started coming in three hours early, unpaid, to practice the cleaning cycle. The machine was like a puzzle designed by someone who hated both puzzles and people. 23 steps each with sub steps. If the milk temperature was off by 1 degree, it would fail. If you pressed buttons in the wrong sequence, it would lock. If Mercury was in retrograde, it would probably fail just to spite you. After two weeks of practice, I mastered it. I started running the cleaning cycle every night after my shift. The machine was actually working, ready to dispense ice cream. But I couldn't tell anyone because I wasn't certified. If corporate found out, Mr. Chen would be fined. So I got creative. I started accidentally leaving the machine on after my secret cleaning sessions. When customers asked for ice cream, I'd say, oh, weird, let me check. Looks like it's actually working right now. Lucky you. Word spread that our machine mysteriously worked during my shifts. Sales increased. Missus Patterson returned, saying she prayed for the machine to be fixed and crediting divine intervention. Kids would cheer when they Saw me behind the counter. I became known as the Ice Cream Whisperer. But success drew attention. The district manager, Patricia, arrived for a surprise inspection. She saw the machine working and asked who'd been maintaining it. Mister Chen panicked and said it must be maintaining itself. Patricia wasn't stupid. She pulled the maintenance logs from the machine's computer. Every cleaning cycle was time stamped at 2:00am, three hours before opening, logged under manual override. Someone's been performing unauthorized maintenance, she announced. This violates our Taylor service agreement. She started reviewing security footage. There I was, night after night, reading the manual by phone, flashlight, while navigating the machine's psychotic cleaning process. Mister Chen looked at me with a mixture of anger and confusion. You could have damaged equipment worth $30,000, Patricia said. You're not sir

The courtroom erupted until I stood, handed the judge a two page document and said, check again. Judge simply looked at my wife and burst out laughing. My name is James, and three months ago I caught my wife Lauren cheating with her yoga instructor. Filed for divorce immediately thinking she'd hit the Jackpot. Since we've been married for five years, Lauren strutted into that Phoenix courtroom wearing a two thousand dollar dress I'd bought her. Confident as hell. Her lawyer was already calculating his commission on what they thought would be a four million dollar payout for my construction business and dad's inheritance. The whole courtroom was packed. Lauren had actually invited some of her friends to watch what she called James's comeuppance. She been telling everyone for weeks how she was about to become independently wealthy. Your honor, her attorney announced, adjusting his expensive tie, missus Peterson deserves substantial compensation for supporting her husband's career growth during their five year marriage. Lauren actually winked at me from across the room. She thought I was just some heartbroken guy who'd roll over and pay whatever she demanded. Her friends in the gallery were practically grinning, waiting for the show. But here's what Lauren didn't know. Six months before I caught her cheating, I'd started noticing weird charges on our joint credit card. Expensive dinners at restaurants I'd never been to, hotel rooms, Booked during girls trips that didn't add up. Designer lingerie purchases that never made it home. The final straw was when I found an eight hundred dollar charge at a jewelry store downtown. When I asked Lauren about it, she said she'd bought herself a birthday present. Problem was, her birthday wasn't for four months. So I hired a private investigator named Frank. Best $5,000 I ever spent. Frank followed Lauren for six weeks. What he discovered was worse than I imagined. The yoga instructor was just the latest in a long line of affair. There was also her personal trainer, a bartender from her favorite restaurant, and even one of my own business partners. Lauren had been using our joint accounts to fund these relationships. Expensive gifts, romantic getaways. Been paying for her affairs, gym memberships. She'd blown through nearly $50,000 of our money over two years. The two page document I handed Judge Ramirez wasn't financial records, with Frank's detailed investigation report proving Lauren had been having multiple affairs for over two years, complete with time stamped photos, hotel receipts, restaurant bills, and screenshots of explicit text messages. In Arizona, adultery doesn't automatically disqualify you from alimony. But it sure does when you've been systematically draining marital assets to fund your affairs. It's called waste of marital property, and it's a big deal in divorce court. The judge read the first page slowly, his eyebrows climbing higher with each line. Flip to page 2. Study the photos and Then burst out laughing so hard his glasses nearly fell off. Missus Peterson, he said, trying to compose himself, not only are you getting nothing from this divorce, but according to this evidence, you owe your husband $47,000 for systematic misuse of marital funds. Lauren's face went from smug to confused to horrified in about three seconds flat. Her friends in the gallery started whisper frantically. One of them actually got up and left. Her lawyer immediately started packing his briefcase, clearly realizing this case had just become a career nightmare instead of a payday. Furthermore, Judge Ramirez continued, given the extensive documentation of financial misconduct, Mrs. Peterson will be responsible for all legal fees incurred by both parties. That meant Lauren owed an additional $23,000 in attorney costs. As we left the courtroom, I overheard Lauren frantically calling someone on her phone, mom, I need to move back in.

My brother Jake was getting married to this girl who seemed super sweet at first. She was all smiles and hugs whenever I was around. But when it came time to pick bridesmaid dresses, her true colors started showing. She wanted everyone to wear this specific coral pink dress that cost $800, not including alterations. I'm a college student working part time at a coffee shop, making barely enough to cover my rent and ramen noodles. $800 might as well have been 8,000. I politely told her I couldn't afford it and asked if there was maybe a cheaper option or if I could get something similar in the same color. She literally laughed at me and said if I couldn't afford to be in her wedding, maybe I shouldn't be in it at all. But then she quickly backtracked when she realized how that sounded and suggested I could just borrow money from my parents. Here's the thing, my parents died in a car accident when I was 17. Jake knew this. His fiance knew this. I've been on my own since then, working my way through school with student loans and whatever jobs I could find. I explained my situation again, thinking maybe she forgot. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic and that everyone has to make sacrifices for weddings. Then she suggested I could sell some of my stuff or pick up Extra shifts to make it happen. I was already working 30 hours a week on top of full time classes. I had nothing left to sell except my laptop, which I needed for school and my car, which I needed to get to work. The whole thing made me feel like absolute garbage. Jake wasn't much better. When I went to him for help, he said his fiance was just stressed about wedding planning and that I should try to understand. He offered to lend me the money, but I'd have to pay him back within six months with interest because they were saving for a house. Interest from my own brother, for a dress I'd wear once to watch him marry someone who clearly thought I was beneath her. That's when I realised this wasn't really about the money. It was about respect. She could have easily picked a less expensive dress or worked with everyone's budgets. Instead, she chose to make it a test of who really wanted to be there for her special day. I told Jake I couldn't make it work and wouldn't be in the wedding party. He got angry and said I was being selfish and trying to ruin his big day. His fiance jumped in and said she wasn't surprised because I'd always been jealous of their relationship and was probably looking for an excuse to cause drama. The whole thing blew up. Jake said if I couldn't support him as a bridesmaid. Then maybe I shouldn't come at all. I said fine, and didn't go to the wedding. I spent that Saturday working a double shift at the coffee shop, making the money I would have blown on a dress I'd never wear again.

I'm 27 years old and my boyfriend Jake is 33. We've been together for almost two years now, and honestly, marriage is probably in our future, but we're not rushing it. Here's the thing, though. My mom still treats me like I'm some teenager sneaking around behind her back whenever we visit my parents. She makes this huge deal about us not sleeping in the same bed, like we're gonna corrupt her precious house or something. We're adults who live together and pay our own, but apparently that doesn't matter to her. She acts like we're gonna start making out at the dinner table if we share a room. This past summer, Jake suggested we just get a hotel room so we could actually be comfortable and not deal with her weird rules. You would have thought we told her we were starting a meth lab in her basement. She went completely insane about it, kept going on and on about how disrespectful we were and how we embarrassed her in front of the neighbors because someone might see us going to the hotel together. She literally made me promise not to do that again like I was 8 years old asking for permission to have a sleepover. I felt so stupid agreeing to it, but I didn't want the drama. So when Christmas planning came around, Jake's parents invited us to visit them in Mexico. They retired there a few years ago and they're super chill people. We decided to go because honestly, it sounded amazing beach weather in December while everyone back home is freezing their asses off. Yes, please. But here's where I got a little sneaky. We didn't tell my parents we weren't coming home for Christmas. When my mom asked me at Thanksgiving if I was gonna keep my promise about not getting a hotel, I told her the truth that I wouldn't be staying at any hotel when we visited them, which was technically true since we weren't visiting them at all. So there I was sitting on this gorgeous balcony overlooking the Caribbean, drinking coffee and watching the sunrise when I made the mistake of checking Facebook. My mom and sisters had posted all this passive aggressive stuff about how hurt they were that I lied to them and how selfish I was for abandoning the family on Christmas. I was feeling pretty good from the vacation drinks the night before because I decided to respond. I told them it was ridiculous that they expected me to follow teenager rules in my late 20s and that I technically kept my promise since I wasn't staying at any hotel during our visit to them. Then I said if they were gonna air our family business on Facebook for everyone to see, I just avoid visits altogether from now on. Well, that got people talking. Some of their friends, Started commenting, asking why they were trying to control their adult daughter's sleeping arrangements. Others were saying stuff like maybe there's a reason she didn't want to come home. My family looked pretty stupid, honestly. They deleted the post pretty quick after that, but the damage was done.

My husband ambushed me during our 5th anniversary dinner and said, Kelly, I've been thinking. We need to evolve past possessiveness and jealousy. We are mature adults and we should be exploring connections without restrictions. Being so possessive isn't healthy. He showed me articles on his phone about polyamory. Actually trying to mask his request like some morally good decision. I looked at the engraved watch hidden in my purse, his anniversary gift. Asked him, you want an open marriage? His eyes lit up like Christmas, even though I hadn't agreed yet. Yes. See? You get it. Most wives would get controlling and insecure, but you understand that love multiplies. I pushed the gift deeper into my purse. Alright, no possessiveness, no restrictions. Let's transcend. Little did he know that I was about to transcend his entire existence. I downloaded dating apps that very night while he watched stamelessly grinning about our journey to enlightenment. Within hours, I'd matched with Doug, his gym buddy, who messaged me finally. Been waiting respectfully for years. And then I matched with Axel, his department director, who wrote, I always admired your brilliance at company events. Dinner tonight. When Doug's name flashed on my phone at breakfast, his coffee mug froze midair. Wait, is that my Doug? My workout partner? He's not your Doug, I said, typing back. That would be possessive, remember? But I see him every Morning at the gym. And now I'll see him for dinner. Isn't expanding connections beautiful? His face went through five different shades of panic. You can't date Doug. We spot each other. We're gym brothers. Brothers? That sounds like toxic, masculine possession to me. The orchid arrangement from Axel arrived Tuesday with a card. Extraordinary. Evening, Jay. My husband had already opened it when I got home. My boss is sending you flowers. He's very thoughtful. He asked me about our arrangement in the partner's meeting. In front of everyone. Asked how I felt about sharing my wife. Do you know how humiliating that was? No, I don't. Then came his mother's garden party that Saturday, which was pure chaos. I brought Nathan, a surgeon I'd met that week. Mom, Dad, this is Kelly's friend. My husband started. Boyfriend, I corrected. This is my boyfriend, Nathan. His mother's champagne glass trembled. Your what? Nathan, my boyfriend, your son, introduced me to ethical non monogamy. He says jealousy is just insecurity. She turned to him with eyes blazing in anger. You said what? Mom, it's not like that. It's exactly like that, I said cheerfully. He explained that monogamy is social conditioning. We're both free to explore. Actually, he even encouraged me to bring Nathan today, normalize our lifestyle. His father pulled him aside immediately. Son, have you lost your goddamn mind? While Nathan charmed the garden club ladies, I heard his mother telling her sister to look up intervention specialists. It was amazing watching my husband already start to regret his choice. But it wasn't the end yet. When I got dressed for another date in the dress he bought me for Christmas, he watched from the doorway. Where are you going now? Doug got us into that jazz club you've been wait listing for months. How? I've been trying since January. He knows the owner. See, multiple partners means expanded social access. Love multiplies, just like you said. The next morning, while I confirmed plans with Axel for his yacht club event, my husband was spiraling. Kelly, this isn't what I envisioned. I thought maybe coffee with strangers occasionally. Not you. Dating my boss and my

So I invited him to family dinner. My fiance, Rebecca, really picked the worst time to call me paranoid about her ex, Nate. We were literally sitting there tasting wedding cakes when she brought it up. She kept insisting they were just friends now and I was being controlling. The thing was, I'd come home early from a work trip last week and saw his car leaving our apartment complex at 2:00am. She had no idea I'd seen it. Every time his name popped up on her phone, she'd flip it face down real quick. When she called me insecure again, I decided to call her bluff. You're right. I'm being unfair. Let's invite Nate to your parents anniversary dinner next week, I said. I watched all the color drain from her face. She tried to backtrack and her family wouldn't want extra guests at their special dinner, but I pushed harder. I'll call him myself to show I trust you. She was trapped and we both knew it. She agreed, but her hands were literally shaking. That night I called Nate and made sure to put him on speaker so Rebecca could hear everything. I told him I wanted to apologize for being the jealous boyfriend and invited him to the family dinner. Rebecca just sat there watching me, completely stuck, tried to turn me down, said it wasn't a good idea. But I kept Pushing, telling him Rebecca really wanted him there. I even offered to pick him up myself, you know, to show there were no hard feelings. When I picked him up that night, the guy was sweating through his dress shirt during the drive. He mentioned Rebecca's parents hated him but wouldn't tell me why. We walked into that dinner together and I swear the whole room just froze. Rebecca's mom dropped her wine glass and it shattered all over the floor. Her dad's face went from normal to purple in about two seconds. What is he doing here? He practically growled. I played innocent and explained I'd invited Rebecca's friend to make peace. Her sister actually laughed out loud. Friends after what he did to her. Right then Rebecca's phone lit up on the table. A text from Nate popped up on the screen. This was a mistake. We should be more careful. Everyone saw it. Her sister snatched the phone before Rebecca could grab it. More messages were right there on the lock screen. Meeting times last night was amazing. And what looked like photos being sent back and forth. Her dad jumped up so fast his chair fell backwards. You're seeing him again. Nate was already heading for the door. Rebecca ran after him, begging him to wait. That's when her family just exploded. Her mom started telling me how Nate had cheated on Rebecca years ago with her own roommate. He'd lied about it for six months. Straight. The whole family had been there for Rebecca through that nightmare of a breakup. And now she was sneaking around with him again. Two months before our wedding, Rebecca came back inside with her makeup running down her face. Her family looked at her like she was a stranger. They telling me story after story about what Nate had put her through. How could you invite him here, Rebecca screamed at me. I stayed calm and reminded her that she told me he was harmless. What was wrong with inviting a friend to dinner? Her family wouldn't stop listing all the terrible things Nate had done, the cheating, the constant lies, how he'd completely vanished after destroying her life. Her sister was still scrolling through the phone, showing everyone more evidence. Hotel bookings from last.

I knew exactly what judges looked for, what evidence mattered, how to prove someone was lying about being A good parent. Three years in, I was the go to person for impossible cases. I turned my pain into expertise. While Jessica and Braden raised their daughter, I became an expert at determining who deserved to keep their kids. Life has a strange sense of humor. Four years later, Braden walked into my firm. I was in the conference room, and I heard his voice at reception, desperate. Explaining how Jessica wanted full custody of their daughter. My boss knocked. Can you handle this case? Do the research? I almost said no. Then curiosity one. Braden looked destroyed. Didn't recognize me at first. I changed. Lost weight, expensive suit, different hairstyle. He was too focused on his problem. She's saying I'm an unfit father, that our relationship was wrong from the start. Then he really looked at me. His face went white. Your. Oh, god. Started to leave, but my boss insisted. Please sit. We're here to help. Braden slumped back down, kept glancing at me while explaining Jessica had cheated with her trainer, now wanted their daughter. Was telling the court Braden wasn't a good father, that their relationship had been unhealthy. The irony was perfect. She'd left me for him. Now she was leaving him and trying to take their child. My boss assured Braden, we take the case. Braden didn't realize I'd be building the entire case, finding every piece of evidence that would determine if he kept his daughter. I spent three weeks investigating, found Jessica's texts to friends bragging about her trainer. Discovered she'd been leaving their daughter with babysitters constantly. Located witnesses who saw Braden at every school event while Jessica was at the gym. Built a file proving who the real parent was. At the custody hearing, I sat at the lawyer's table organizing evidence. Jessica walked in, confident. Until she saw me. Her face went pale. She grabbed her lawyer's arm, whispering frantically. The judge noticed her panic. For two hours, I handed my boss every document.

I'm 27 years old and my boyfriend Jake is 33. We've been together for almost two years now, and honestly, marriage is probably in our future, but we're not rushing it. Here's the thing, though. My mom still treats me like I'm some teenager sneaking around behind her back whenever we visit my parents. She makes this huge deal about us not sleeping in the same bed, like we're gonna corrupt her precious house or something. We're adults who live together and pay our own, but apparently that doesn't matter to her. She acts like we're gonna start making out at the dinner table if we share a room. This past summer, Jake suggested we just get a hotel room so we could actually be comfortable and not deal with her weird rules. You would have thought we told her we were starting a meth lab in her basement. She went completely insane about it, kept going on and on about how disrespectful we were and how we embarrassed her in front of the neighbors because someone might see us going to the hotel together. She literally made me promise not to do that again like I was 8 years old asking for permission to have a sleepover. I felt so stupid agreeing to it, but I didn't want the drama. So when Christmas planning came around, Jake's parents invited us to visit them in Mexico. They retired there a few years ago and they're super chill people. We decided to go because honestly, it sounded amazing beach weather in December while everyone back home is freezing their asses off. Yes, please. But here's where I got a little sneaky. We didn't tell my parents we weren't coming home for Christmas. When my mom asked me at Thanksgiving if I was gonna keep my promise about not getting a hotel, I told her the truth that I wouldn't be staying at any hotel when we visited them, which was technically true since we weren't visiting them at all. So there I was sitting on this gorgeous balcony overlooking the Caribbean, drinking coffee and watching the sunrise when I made the mistake of checking Facebook. My mom and sisters had posted all this passive aggressive stuff about how hurt they were that I lied to them and how selfish I was for abandoning the family on Christmas. I was feeling pretty good from the vacation drinks the night before because I decided to respond. I told them it was ridiculous that they expected me to follow teenager rules in my late 20s and that I technically kept my promise since I wasn't staying at any hotel during our visit to them. Then I said if they were gonna air our family business on Facebook for everyone to see, I just avoid visits altogether from now on. Well, that got people talking. Some of their friends, Started commenting, asking why they were trying to control their adult daughter's sleeping arrangements. Others were saying stuff like maybe there's a reason she didn't want to come home. My family looked pretty stupid, honestly. They deleted the post pretty quick after that, but the damage was done.

Why is she suddenly concerned about my finances? My girlfriend Sarah has this thing where she constantly calls me cheap. Not in a mean way, supposedly. Always with a giggle, always just teasing. But it happens constantly. Every dinner out, let me guess, you're calculating the tip to the penny again. Every gift I buy her. Wow, big spend under over here. When I suggest cooking instead of ordering take out, there's my frugal boyfriend. When I use a coupon, god, you're so cheap. It's embarrassing. It started small, maybe once a week, but over our 8 months together there it became her go to joke about me. Her friends knew me as the cheap boyfriend. Her sister would ask if I was letting Sarah buy anything expensive. The breaking point was last Tuesday at her friend Jessica's birthday dinner. Eight of us at this trendy steakhouse. When the server asked if we wanted to split the check evenly, I said sure. Sarah immediately jumped in with, oh, no, he'll want to calculate exactly what he ate. Meet my boyfriend, the human calculator. Everyone laughed. I smiled and nodded like always. But something snapped inside me. Wednesday morning, I opened a separate checking account. If I'm so cheap, might as well lean into it. That afternoon, Sarah texted wanting to grab Starbucks. I met her there, ordered myself a venti caramel macchiato, got her a tall Black coffee, no additions. Why'd you get me the small size? She asked, confused. Well, since I'm famously cheap, I figured you'd prefer to upgrade your own order. She laughed awkwardly, thinking I was joking. Back Thursday, we went to dinner at our usual Mexican place. When the check came, $47, 83, I pulled out my phone calculator, put it exactly down the middle, put down 2390 twos. You're seriously calculating it to the cent, she asked. Just being true to my nature, I said cheerfully. You always say I'm cheap. Friday, she texted saying she was short on gas money. Hint, hint. Usually I'd Venmo her $30 without thinking. Instead, I replied, sorry, babe, you know how cheap I am. Can't spare it. She called immediately, are you being serious right now? Dead serious. I'm embracing who you say I am. Saturday, she wanted to see the new Marvel movie. I bought one ticket online, showed up to meet her at the theater. Where's my ticket, she asked. Oh, I didn't buy you one. That would be generous. And generous isn't really my brand, remember? She stood there stunned while I walked into the theater. Got 17 texts during the previews. Sunday morning, she came over with breakfast sandwiches, set one in front of me expectantly. Thanks for thinking of me, I said, but I can't accept this. Letting someone else pay for my food wouldn't be very cheap of me. She slammed her hand on the counter. Okay. Enough. This is insane. You're taking my jokes way too seriously. I sipped my coffee calmly. Jokes, Sarah, you've called me cheap literally hundreds of times in front of your friends, your family, strangers at restaurants. I didn't mean it like that. How did you mean it then when you introduced me to your co workers as the guy who splits appetizers? When you told the Uber driver I'd probably ask for a receipt, her face was getting red. Those were jokes. Were they, though? Because you seem pretty committed to the bit. Monday, she tried a different approach, suggested we go grocery shopping together.

But I've been deployed for 8 months. Who's baby? I'm staring at my phone at 3 a. M. In Afghanistan. My girlfriend tiara just posted this elaborate pregnancy announcement on Instagram. Pink balloons, professional photos, the works. Caption read finally pregnant 3 months along. Time to lock this idiot down. Military wifey why she baby on board? He doesn't know yet. I did the math, then did it again. I've been deployed for 8 months. Last time I was home was January. It's now September. 3 months pregnant means she conceived in June when I was 5,000 miles away eating MREs. I typed one comment who's baby? What happened next was bib. Her phone started going insane, comments flooding in, people doing the same math I did. Screenshot spreading everywhere. She tried to delete the post, but it kept glitching, failing while people kept screenshotting. Within an hour I had 73 DMs from mutual friends. My mom was calling at 3 a. M. Her time. But the best part Tiara's mom commented before the deletion so Proud. Derek will be such a good father. Derek not my name, I'm Evan. Then tiara went live fake crying about being a deployment widow and how I abandoned her. She slipped up again. Derek I mean in therapy has helped me realize, someone commented therapists don't usually father their patients babies, hon. She ended the live immediately. Then my neighbor Derek, the guy I asked to check on Her messaged me bro, what did you expect? I was there when you weren't. Do the right thing and let her go. PS she's moving in with me. The audacity was unreal. This unemployed dude living off my deployed girlfriend wants me to do the right thing. I screenshot everything and send it to everyone we know. But wait, it gets worse. Tiara's mom called my mom at 4:00am. My mom recorded the whole thing. Your son needs to accept responsibility. For what? He's been deployed for 8 months. For abandoning tiara. She had needs. Baby needs support from its real father, Derek. But Evan makes more money. Military pays well. Derek's between jobs. Between jobs? This dude's been unemployed the whole time? Then came the legal threats. Some sketchy lawyer emailed my military account demanding monthly support payments for emotional distress. Half my house value. I bought it before we met. Continued health insurance, $10,000 for baby supplies, A written apology for public humiliation. My JAG lawyer laughed until he cried. She wants military benefits while pregnant with another man's baby. This is comedy gold. But the peak entitlement happened next. Tiara made a TikTok crying in her car, the one I was still paying insurance on, talking about deployment abuse and started hashtag dash deployment widow. The comments destroyed her. Ma'am, he's literally commenting from Afghanistan. Deploy. I meant widow. He's very much alive. Imagine telling your kid daddy was deployed when you were conceived. Then I got Emergency leave approved. First, stop changing my locks. Tiara had been living in my house with Eric. I walked in to find Eric's clothes in my closet, his gaming setup in my office, sound photos on my fridge, and a future Mr. And Mrs. Morrison sign in the living room. Morrison? Derek's last name. While packing their stuff, I found Tiara's pregnancy journal. One entry made my blood boil. Derek says we should wait until Evans deployed longer so he can't contest anything. Military guys get screwed in court. This baby will secure the bag. Then they came home. Derek went white seeing me. Bro, I can explain. Get out of my house. Tiara started her performance. Babe

Then I saw the group photo. All of them, on a private beach in Maui. I stared at my phone in disbelief. My entire family had ditched my wedding for a vacation. The caption read, finally together. Like I didn't exist. But here's what they didn't know. For years, I've been quietly bankrolling their lifestyle. The family business cards all linked to my accounts. Your mortgage co signs my credit. The lake house, utilities, auto pay from my bank. I've been the invisible ATM, funding their perfect lives while they whispered that my wife wasn't their kind of people. So I sent one text back. Perfect timing. Then I called my attorney. Within an hour, I'd cut off every shared account, canceled every auto payment, and revoked access to everything. The secondary property my sister lived in. She was using my credit for the rate. Not anymore. It started small. Day 3, the dealership called about a bounced car lease. Day 5, the office building sent late rent warnings. By week 2, the group chat was pure your chaos. Can someone cover the lakehouse utilities? My card got declined for Scottsdale. Does the company still cover insurance? They were scrambling, but still no apology. Just confusion about why their money fountain suddenly only dried up. Then my sister called. First time since the wedding. Not congratulations or sorry we missed it. Just, you can't do this to us. I didn't even answer, just blocked the number. But the real fun was just beginning. See, I'd forgotten about one little detail. My dad's precious boat. The 40 foot yacht he loved showing off at the Marina every weekend. Guess whose name was on the insurance policy? Week three. 3, I got a call from the Marina. Sir, your boat insurance was declined for non payment. We need it removed by Friday or it gets impounded. I could have warned him. Should have, maybe. Instead, I drove to the Marina Thursday night with my wife and a bottle of champagne. We sat on the dock and watched them tow away Dad's pride and joy. My wife raised her glass. To new beginnings. Too expensive lessons. I replied. The group chat exploded. The next morning, my aunt was practically screaming in all caps, the boat is gone! Who didn't pay the insurance had called me 17 times. I let every single one go to voicemail. Each message got more desperate. Son, please call me back. There's been some mistake. We can work this out. Work what out? That they skipped my wedding for cocktails on a beach? Then my mom tried a different approach. She showed up at my office unannounced, tears streaming down her face. Security called up to ask if I wanted to see her. Tell her I'm in Maui, I said. The security guard paused. Sir, she says she's your mother. Not anymore. But the nuclear option came. When my uncle called, Uncle Rick, the family mediator, the guy who always smooth things over at Thanksgiving, his voice was shaking. Your father's having chest pains. The stress is killing him. You need to stop this. Funny, I said I had chest pains, too. Right around the time I saw 40 people. I love choosing a vacation over the most important.

When I was 17, my whole world was shattered with six words. You'll never be my real daughter. Warren had raised me since I was five, been to every school play, taught me to ride a bike. But during a fight about college applications, when I mentioned wanting to study culinary arts instead of business like his biological kids, his mask finally slipped. Fiona and Kevin would never disappoint me like this. But then again, there actually mine, he said, his voice cold. Fiona and Kevin were his biological children, and he had always treated us differently. I saw the truth in his eyes that day. 12 years of playing dad, and I was still just his wife's baggage to him. That's when something crystallized in me. I wasn't going to beg for his approval anymore. Instead, I'd become so undeniably successful that his rejection would become his loss. I started documenting everything I cooked, building a portfolio, and entering every competition I could find. While Warren boasted about Fiona's MCAT scores and Kevin's internships at family dinners, I quietly applied for apprenticeships at Michelin star restaurants. When I got accepted to train under a James Beard Award winner in New York, I didn't even tell him. Mom knew, but I asked her to keep it quiet. I want to focus on my craft, I said. Though, really, I just couldn't bear To hear him diminish this, too. For three years, I disappeared into the culinary world. I worked six teen hour days with burns up my arms, screaming chefs in my ears, all while sleeping in a shared apartment. I worked my way up from prep cook to line cook to sous chef, each position more demanding than the last. Meanwhile, Warren would send mom photos from Fiona's white coat ceremony and Kevin's graduation, never once asking how I was doing. During rare video calls with my mom, he'd be in the background, occasionally throwing in comments like, still playing with food, or, Fiona just published her first research paper. As if I needed the comparison, I started developing my own style. Fusion techniques combining molecular gastronomy with comfort food. Things that caught the attention of food critics. When a famous food magazine wanted to do a feature on rising young chefs, I almost said no, afraid that Warren would see it and ridicule me even further. But my mentor convinced me by saying, cook for yourself. That article LED to me opening my own restaurant and feeding more than 300 people every single day. Then one day, I got an invitation to Fiona's engagement party. I almost and go. But then I realized I wasn't the weak girl scared of her stepdad's judgment anymore. So I went and arrived fashionably late. Fiona spotted me, and her face lit up like Christmas. Oh, my god, Lena! Kevin rushed in behind her. It's so nice to see you. They hadn't seen me in two years. We saw the article about your restaurant opening. Kevin said, that's so cool. Fiona grabbed my hands. My friend ate there last week. She couldn't stop raving about it. Said it was transformative.

When my high school announced a complete meat ban last September, we thought it was a joke. Any student caught with meat products faces immediate suspension. Principal Harrison declared at assembly, we're becoming a progressive, wellness campus. She'd installed actual security guards who would check for meat products in our bags. Even the cafeteria would only serve vegan options. This is about teaching sustainable living, she said, ignoring the groans from 1,800 teenagers. The football team nearly rioted. But we need protein for sports, they argued. Plants have protein. DOC Harrison replied, fine, we'd play her game. But here's what Doctor Harrison didn't realize. She just declared war on teenagers who lived on chicken nuggets. And we were about to show her what happened when you messed with our food. On day one, Cleo came to school wearing what looked like a normal dress until you got close. She'd actually sewn together hundreds of beef jerky wrappers on it. Cleo, that's inappropriate, Doctor Harrison said during first period. Go change immediately. Cleo stood up slowly. Of course, Doctor Harrison. Then she pulled off the dress to reveal another outfit underneath, a shirt with a giant photo of a T bone steak. The whole class erupted to Harrison's face, went red. Office now! But Cleo sacrifice had inspired everyone. The next day, Tommy walked into school carrying a chicken. An actual live chicken. What is that? Doctor Harrison shrieked, running into the hallway. Colonel Sanders, Tommy said calmly, producing a stack of papers. He's my emotional support animal. Here's the documentation from my therapist. She grabbed the papers, reading frantically. This is can't be real. Call my therapist if you want, Tommy said. The chicken promptly pooped on her shoe. She couldn't refuse, since it was all legitimate. Within a week, ten different students had emotional support chickens. Hallways were literal chaos from all their poop and screaming. I watched Doctor Harrison chase one through the cafeteria while it knocked over trash cans. Whose chicken is this? She screamed. That's Mcnugget, someone yelled. The second week was even worse. The chemistry club claimed they were doing an experiment on artificial flavoring when smoke started pouring from their lab. But really, they were trying to release a special scent. And it worked. Within minutes, the entire school reeked of bacon. Every protein scanner in the building went haywire, beeping non stop. What did you do? Doctor Harrison burst into the chemistry room. It's just artificial scent molecules, Jennifer said in a we're studying Esther's. The smell was so strong that parents called asking why their kids came home smelling like breakfast. Then Dante turned his locker into a black market deli. I watched him slip a piece of beef jerky to a freshman for $5. That's insane, I said. Supply and demand. He shrugged. I'm the only supplier. He got caught the next day when Doctor Harrison personally searched his locker. Three day suspension. She Screamed old, filling up a bag of jerky. Like evidence in a murder trial. Dante walked out with his head high. Someone started a free Dante chant. Doctor Harrison was falling apart. Then came Spirit weeks International Food Day. At exactly 12 p m. Dex, our quarterback, stood on the center cafeteria table holding a three foot party sub packed with every meat imaginable. This is for everyone tired of eating grass! He shouted, taking a massive bite. Doctor Harrison burst through the doors, screaming immediate!

I can't be your mom anymore. I need to find myself. What mom didn't know was that I'd thank her for this one day. It was exactly one year since dad died, and she'd promised we'd visit his grave together. I'd saved my allowance for three weeks to buy yellow roses, his favorites, and stayed up late making cookies for him, like he taught me before the accident. I made sure to remind mom about it. Remember, we have to visit Dad's grave before we go to my birthday party, okay? My mom smiled, reassured me that she was all packed and ready to go. I found out exactly what she meant by ready to go. On the morning of my 12th birthday, I woke up to find her car was already gone from the driveway, and her room was cleared out of all her belongings, leaving behind nothing but a note. I didn't shed a tear. I just walked. The cemetery was three miles from the house, but I went anyway, carrying a tin of cookies and a grocery store bouquet. My feet were sore and had busted calluses by the time I got there, but nothing hurt more than losing both my parents on my birthday, just one year apart from each other. One by accident, one by choice. So while I sat there sobbing on the stone, my dad's best friend, Joel Walked up and sat beside me in the MUD. We sat there talking about my dad for a while. All the good memories we had. Then he asked the question I had hoped he wouldn't. Did you walk here? By the way, where's your mom? He asked, pointing to my worn out shoes. She's not coming, I told him. As calm as a 12 year old could be at that moment. Joel nodded. How about you stay with me and my wife for the night? I have a daughter, Ava, who could use a friend tonight, too. I didn't even nod, just followed him back to the car, silently staring out the window. And while they took me in, it wasn't always the easiest. I stayed in my room most of the time, hiding away, thinking I was a burden. They'd eventually leave, too. Ava was the first to melt down my walls. She spent every morning braiding my hair before we went to school, something mom never bothered to do, even when dad was around. Their Thursday family game nights were bizarre to me at first because nobody screamed when they lost or threw the board across the room like mom always did. Joel's wife L helped me with homework, saying some things take more effort than others. Plus, I never really liked math, so I don't blame you. But just as things were getting better, I saw something that broke me all over again. My mom had posted A photo of herself at the beach, captioned, no regrets living for me and my happiness. I just lost it completely. Joel heard me sobbing and came in. Didn't say anything, just held me while I sobbed and ranted. Then he drove me to the hospital. Your dad and I used to come here when things got hard, he said, leading me through the children's ward. Helping these kids reminded us why we became doctors. We spent the night reading stories to kids who couldn't sleep, bringing juice boxes to worried parents, watching Joel work his magic turning scared faces into smiles. We were so busy helping people who had it worse that I eventually forgot about mom. We kept going back every week. I Learned every kid's name, their favorite colors, and in the middle of it all, I finally felt a sense of belonging and direction. I told Joel on the way back home, I want to be a doctor, too. His eyes grew wide, smiling proudly at me. Your dad would love that. Medical school flew by with Joel bringing me to Dad's grave after every semester to share my grades. I quickly forgot about mom, even unfriending her so I wouldn't see her posts about exploring yourself in your

Marry for love, please, my mom said, rolling her eyes. That's just B S. That Disney shows have been promoting since the 30s. Your mother is right. You need to face reality. Dad agreed while reading through his newspapers. Marry bridge is transactional. You either choose stability or choose stupidity. They continue to compare my struggling artist boyfriend to their friend's successful heart surgeon son. For years, I defended him, but it was futile. When I turned 26, my parents gave me an ultimatum. Continue dating my boyfriend or get cut off from the family completely. That meant no more help paying off student loans, phone plans, car insurance, everything. I loved my boyfriend, but neither of us could afford to live without my parents support. So we broke up mutually. And I started dating Jacob, the surgeon. Now, don't get me wrong, he's a gentleman. Perfect on paper, in every way. Rich, pretty, attractive, and great with his hands. You know, as a surgeon. We quickly got engaged, and my parents were thrilled, bragging to everyone about how they got their daughter to break up with her bad boyfriend and listen to them. But, boy, were they going to regret it. You see, Jacob had only one flaw. He was a mama's boy. And unfortunately, his mama, Mildred, was worse than mine. So when Jacob moved in with us, she did, too, taking Over my parents master bedroom, saying that they always slept together again. Not in that way. But that was just the start of things. Mildred had other quirks. She constantly complained about my mom's cooking, making sure it was perfect for her little Jacob. She cut down dad's rose bush to keep a safe environment for her baby boy. Within a month, she managed to redecorate the entire house from soft and elegant to leopard print and gold. Throwing out all the antiques because it was depressing. Of course. Everything was ordered using my parents credit card. Because we're family now, and family share. And then came the seven emotional support Chihuahuas that chewed on the sofa, barked constantly, and enjoyed biting and growling at my dad. And the best part of it all was the fact that Jacob refused to stand up to her. Even when it was clear on his face that he was tired of her craziness too. When my parents tried talking to him about it all, he told them, the moment you disagree, she'll terminate the engagement. Is that what you want? By the exhausted looks on their faces, they weren't even sure anymore. But then it happened. Mildred's ultimate 65th birthday bash. Spectacular at our house. Without permission or even so much as a warning. My parents came home to find 200 strangers destroying the house. Kids ran around with markers, drawing on the walls and furniture, while their parents spilled food and drinks. All over the hardwood floor. One couple got hot and steamy in my parents'room. There's raided mom and dad's jewelry, stuffing their pockets. The entire place was worse than any frat house party I'd seen. While they looked for Mildred, one of the seven Chihuahuas latched onto my dad's leg. He shook his leg around, yelling for help, but was quickly surrounded by other dancing men in the mix. With dad distracted, mom went on the hunt for Mildred. And stopped dead in her tracks when she spotted a teenager cutting the strings to her precious piano, the only thing that ever gave her happiness. She broke down sobbing. The house was destroyed by the time the party ended. Stains everywhere, broken furniture. And for perfectionist parents, oh, it was a sight to behold. And Mildred already snuck out for her month long cruise, leaving my parents to deal with the mess she'd made. Because we're family. And that's when I saw it. Regret plastered on their faces. My parents broke down in front of me, sobbing. You need to break up with him immediately. We'll pay for everything. We'll help you get your boyfriend back. We'll apologize to him ourselves.

My daughter's fourth grade teacher told her class that blood is blue inside your body and only turns red when it hits oxygen. Lily came home repeating this fact while showing me her veins. I gently explained, that's actually not true. Blood is always red because of hemoglobin, just darker red in veins. She looked at me confused, but Missus Wilson showed us a whole Powerpoint about it. Dad. She even had diagrams from a science book. Next morning, I packed my work scrubs in my bag. I'm an ER nurse at Mercy General and I was working the three PM shift. Anyway, I sent Missus Wilson an email asking if I could do a quick 15 minute presentation about blood for Career Day that afternoon. She loved the idea. When I arrived, Missus Wilson introduced me as Lily's dad, who works at the hospital. Twenty eight kids stared up at me from their desks, covered in Lisa Frank folders and Minecraft pencil cases. I heard you guys Learned that blood is blue inside your body, I said. The entire class nodded enthusiastically. Missus Wilson beamed from her desk. I pulled out a vacutainer blood collection tube from my pocket. This is what we use to draw blood at the hospital. Notice something? I held it up. The tube creates a vacuum. No oxygen inside at all. Missus Wilson smile started fading as I explained. When we Draw blood with these. It never touches oxygen until we pop the cap off. But I showed photos on my phone of sealed blood tubes. See? Still red. The kids were fascinated. I showed them medical textbook pages on my tablet. Missus Wilson kept clearing her throat, her face getting redder than the blood samples on my screen. But our textbook says it's blue, one boy argued, pointing to their science book. I walked over and checked the publication date. 1998. Medicine Updates pretty fast, I explained. We used to think lots of things that turned out to be wrong. Missus Wilson suddenly stood up. Well, thank you for that interesting presentation, Mister. Johnson, but we need to move on to math now. I nodded and started packing up when a girl raised her hand. So our textbook is wrong? The class erupted in whispers. Missus Wilson's voice got tight. The curriculum says. Actually, I interrupted, pulling up the state science standards on my phone, the current curriculum specifically mentions this myth as something to correct. I showed her the screen. That's when she asked me to step in to the hallway. The kids watched wide eyed as the door closed behind us. Do you have any idea how hard it is to teach these kids when parents undermine my authority? She hissed. Now they'll question everything I say. I kept my voice calm. Isn't that exactly what we want them to do? Question things and learn critical thinking? I've Been teaching for 22 years, she snapped. I'm not changing my whole curriculum because some nurse thinks he knows better than our textbooks. That night, Lily asked me if she was in trouble because Missus Wilson kept giving her mean looks all afternoon. I assured her she wasn't. The next day, Missus Wilson announced a pop quiz with questions like what color is blood inside the body? Lily answered red and got marked wrong. She came home crying with a big red F. I requested a meeting with the principal and brought printouts of medical tech

Aria was the girl who'd throw any girl under the bus for five seconds of male approval. Since freshman year, everyone knew Aria as the girl who'd loudly announce she only hung out with guys because girls are too much drama. She'd sit at the guys table, laugh at every sexist joke louder than anyone else, and somehow convinced herself that calling other girls too sensitive made her so. The crazy part was the guys ate it up. Even teachers thought Aria was refreshingly laid back compared to other girls. I remember this one time in PE when a girl complained about the boys snapping girls bra straps. Aria actually stood up and said it's just guys being guys, stop being such a baby about it. The male coach literally thanked her for being rational. That was Aria's whole thing. She was the cool girl who got it. She'd brag about watching porn with the guys, rate other girls bodies with them, and called feminism victim mentality. Girls who tried to call out inappropriate behavior became her targets. He'd mock them with fake crying sounds, post their complaints on social media to ridicule them, and loudly proclaim how she wasn't like those uptight bitches who couldn't take a joke. During junior year, when Natalie reported getting groped at a party, Aria was the first to say Natalie was probably asking for it. Wearing that dress, the guys would high Five her. Call her basically a dude with tits, and she'd beam like she'd won the lottery. When we all came back on Monday after spring break of senior year, we were preparing for the moment. Aria went off on a girl and snickered with one of her guy friends. But first period arrives, and Aria walks past the guy table without even glancing at them. Not like avoiding them. Aria just walked past like they didn't exist. She sits down at a table full of girls, the same girls she'd spent three years mocking. Vivian, who she'd called a dramatic princess. Dre, who she'd labeled attention seeking for reporting harassment. Natalie, whose reputation she'd tried to destroy. The guys started calling her over. Yo, Aria, we saved your spot. She didn't even turn her head. It was like she'd gone deaf to male voices. At first, everyone thought it was some weird joke. Maybe she lost a bet over spring break. Maybe this was some elaborate prank that would turn into the ultimate pick me moment. We were on the edge of our seat, waiting for her to burst out yelling, I was right. Girls are too much drama. But Aria kept sitting with the girls. She stopped responding to the guys texts, unfollowed all of them on every platform. When Ethan tried to talk to her after chemistry, she looked right through him and kept walking. Days turned into weeks. Guys went from confused to angry. They started Spreading rumors that Aria was on her period, that she turned into a crazy feminist overnight, that she was probably a lesbian now. They tried everything to get a reaction. Nothing. Aria just kept sitting with the girls, actually listening when they talked, not interrupting to defend male behavior. The girls were suspicious at first. This had to be some long con to gather gossip for the boys. But Aria never brought up the guys, never defended them. When Jade mentioned feeling uncomfortable about something her boyfriend said, Aria actually responded with, that's not okay. You deserve better. Everyone's jaws broke the floor. Then we all found out what happened, and it was so much worse than anyone imagined. Audrey revealed what she'd heard from her older brother, who went to college with Ethan's brother.

In the video, my husband and my son were with her, and my son was hugging her, saying he wished she could be his mother. I stared at my phone in complete shock, watching my eight year old tell another woman he wanted her as his mom. My birthday cake sat untouched on the in counter. 32 candles melted into colorful puddles of wax. The balloons I'd hung that morning mocked me from the ceiling. Instead of crying like the old me would have done, I did something that would change everything forever. I called my lawyer first. Jennifer, it's Paisley. I need those divorce papers we discussed last month. Tonight. I don't care what time it is, Paisley. It's almost 10 p m. What the hell happened? He's been secretly taking Ethan to see his ex girlfriend Marisa behind my back for months. I have video proof of everything. Jesus. I'll have the papers ready by morning. Then I called my bank's emergency hotline. Account freeze, credit cards canceled immediately. The joint savings we'd carefully built over 10 years of marriage locked down tighter than Fort Knox. By the time Marcus finally walked through our front door at midnight, smelling like her perfume, I had already filed for emergency custody, called a locksmith to change every lock in the house, and methodically packed All his belonging into black garbage bags lined up by the front door like a funeral procession. Hey, babe, sorry we're so ridiculously late tonight, he said casually, fumbling with his house key that no longer worked. Little Ethan fell asleep in the car again. He finally looked up from his phone and saw the divorce papers spread across our coffee table like evidence at a crime scene. How was your wonderful day with Marisa? I asked, my voice steady and cold as winter ice. His face went completely white. The color drained so fast I genuinely thought he might collapse and faint right there. Paisley, sweetheart, I can explain everything. It's really not what you think it is. Save your explanations for the judge tomorrow morning. You're officially served. I handed him the thick custody papers with trembling hands. His fingers shook violently as he read the emergency restraining order. Our son Ethan appeared in the doorway, rubbing his sleepy eyes, still wearing the expensive new jacket I'd never seen before in my life. Mom, what's happening? Why are all of Dad's sitting outside in bags? Your father forgot it was my birthday today, honey. But he certainly remembered to take you to see his ex girlfriend instead. Ethan's little face crumpled with confusion. She said she was just Dad's old friend from college. She bought me ice cream and told me. What exactly did she tell you, baby? That maybe someday we could all live together like one. Big, happy family. Marcus grabbed my arm desperately, his grip almost painful. You can't just destroy and tear our entire family apart over this one thing. I already did. Now the courts will decide who Ethan really belongs with. His confident smirk, the same one he'd worn for years whenever I questioned his suspicious late nights, vanished completely when he realized I wasn't the same naive woman who used to wait up for him every single night with dinner warming in the oven. Paisley, please be reasonable. We can work this whole thing out between us. Marissa honestly means absolutely nothing to me. I pulled out my phone and played the damming video again. Really? Because she apparently has

When my high school announced a complete meat ban last September, we thought it was a joke. Any student caught with meat products faces immediate suspension. Principal Harrison declared at Assembly, we're becoming a progressive, wellness campus. She'd installed actual security guards who would check for meat products in our bags. Even the cafeteria would only serve vegan options. This is about teaching sustainable living, she said, ignoring the groans from 1,800 teenagers. The football team nearly rioted. But we need protein for sports, they argued. Plants have protein. Doctor Harrison replied, fine, we'd play her game. But here's what Doctor Harrison didn't realize. She just declared war on teenagers who lived on chicken nuggets. And we were about to show her what happened when you messed with our food. On day one, Cleo came to school wearing what looked like a normal dress until you got close. She'd actually sewn together hundreds of beef jerky wrappers on it. Cleo, that's inappropriate! Doctor Harrison said during first period. Go change immediately. Cleo stood up slowly. Of course, Doctor Harrison. Then she pulled off the dress to reveal another outfit underneath, a shirt with a giant photo of a T bone steak. Whole class erupted. Doctor Harrison's face went red. Office now! The Cleo sacrifice had inspired everyone. The next day, Tommy walked into school carrying a chicken. An actual live chicken. What is that? Doctor Harrison shrieked, running into the hallway. Colonel Sanders, Tommy said calmly, using a stack of papers, he's my emotional support animal. Here's the documentation from my therapist. She grabbed the papers, reading frantically. This. This can't be real. Call my therapist if you want, Tommy said. The chicken promptly pooped on her shoe. She couldn't refuse, since it was all legitimate. Within a week, 10 different students had emotional support chickens. The hallways were literal chaos from all their poop and screaming. I watched Doctor Harrison chase one through the cafeteria while it knocked over trash cans. Whose chicken is this? She screamed. That's Mcnugget, someone yelled. The second week was even worse. The chemistry club claimed they were doing an experiment on artificial flavoring when smoke started pouring from their lab. But really, they were trying to release a special scent. And it worked. Within minutes, the entire school reeked of bacon. Every protein scanner in the building went haywire, beeping non stop. What did you do? Doctor Harrison burst into the chemistry room. It's just artificial scent molecules, Jennifer said innocently. We're studying esters. Smell was so strong that parents called asking why their kids came home smelling like breakfast. Then Dante turned his locker into a black market deli. I watched him slip a piece of beef jerky to a freshman for $5. That's insane, I said. Buy and demand. He shrugged. I'm the only supplier. He got caught the next day when Doctor Harrison personally searched his locker. Three day suspension. She screamed, holding Up a bag of jerky like evidence in a murder trial. Dante walked out with his head high. Someone started a free Dante chant. Doctor Harrison was falling apart. Then came Spirit Week's International Food Day. At exactly 12 p m. Decks, our quarterback, stood on the center cafeteria table holding a three foot party sub packed with every meat imaginable. This is for everyone tired of eating grass, he shouted, taking a massive bite. Doctor Harrison burst through the doors, screaming, immediate expulsion! But then Raven stood up with a bucket of KFC. Mike pulled out Big Macs. Within seconds, 200 students had revealed hidden meat in a coordinated protest. Doctor Harrison grabbed the intercom, shrieking, lockdown! Freeze! But the art students released 50 remote control

The moment he walked through the door, the entire hallway went silent. Active shooter drill, everyone. Someone shouted, and half the students hit the floor while the others laughed. Killian just kept walking while people filmed him. By lunch, there were already three different TikTok box of him. They found pipe bombs in his locker. My friend Alex told me my brother was here when it happened. Said Killian had a whole hit list and escape routes. The teachers weren't subtle, either. During attendance, Mr. Williams made Killian stand up and empty his backpack for random security check. When Killian pulled out a calculator in AP Physics. This is a Kring. Actually flinched. The security guard followed him between every single class. Parents had already started a petition to remove him, which had 800 signatures by second period. But I started noticing things that didn't add up. Killian left granola bars on the desk of this kid whose parents couldn't afford lunch money. When some sophomores were destroying a special needs kids art project, Killian stepped between them. He tutored ESL students after school in the library. He carried tampons in his backpack because the school never restock the bathroom. Girls would slip him notes, he'd slip them back supplies. But nobody ever thanked him. They just took what they needed and went back to posting about how much Of a monster he was. It all shifted the day I stayed late for drama rehearsal. It was 6 p m. School was empty except for theater kids in the auditorium. I went out the back exit for fresh air and saw Mister Rayner, our AP history teacher, walking with Lacey, a freshman from my bus. They were heading toward the parking lot, and something about how she was walking, shoulders hunched, arms wrapped around herself made my stomach twist. I got up to them and hid behind the bushes to listen. You need extra tutoring at my house. I heard Mister Rayner tell her. Your grades really need special attention. Lacey looked terrified. I should call my mom. I already told her you'd be staying late for academic help. His hand was on her lower back, pushing her toward his car. She was thrilled. You're getting personal assistance. I was about to pull out my phone, but that's when Killian appeared from behind the dumpsters. Lacey, your mom's here to pick you up, he said calmly. She's in the front lot. Mister Rayner's face went dark. Miss Killian, Lacy's with me. We have a scheduled session. No, you don't! Killian stepped between them. Lacy, go to the front. Your mom's in the blue Honda. Lacy ran. She goddamn sprinted. Mr. Rayner grabbed Killian's shoulder. You have no idea what you're interfering with. I've been helping struggling students for fifteen years. Private tutoring, academic support. Principal Davies knows all about My methods? I know exactly what your methods are. Killian said. I've been documenting them for two years. You. Rayner laughed. School shooter. Who's going to believe you? He walked away. Which is when I finally stepped out. The next day, Killian and I went to Principal Davies. We told him everything we saw. But he leaned back in his chair and smiled. Mr. Rayner is our most decorated teacher. Thirty year veteran, coach of the year. His private tutoring has helped hundreds of struggling students. He looked at Killian. You're a convicted criminal who planned to murder children. And now you're stalking our best teacher. Then he turned to me. And you're believing a school shooter over a man who shaped young minds for decades? I think you both need psychological evaluation. He picked up his phone. Security, I need Killian escorted off campus. He's having delusions again. Killian stood up slowly. How many kids, Davies? How many kids did you send to his house knowing what he was? Get out before I call your Parole officer. That night, someone posted AI generated photo

When my son was 11, his school bus crashed, and his neck was whiplashed so hard that his airway was crushed. The doctors told us he would recover, but he might never speak again. But this didn't stop his younger sister, Rosie, from talking his ear off. Nathan would listen, smile, or even text responses back. Usually she's okay with that, but one time, when she came home from a bad day at school, she immediately ran to Nathan, and when he just patted her back in response, she whispered, I just wish you could tell me it'll be okay. Nathan spent a lot more time alone after that, and whenever I walked into his room to check on him, he would asleep under the covers. I figured it was just soccer practice tiring him out. And then came Rosie's seventh birthday party. Right after she blew out the candles, Nathan lifted his hand up and the room went silent. I was confused because this was usually something he did when something was wrong, but everything seemed fine. He then took a deep breath, his face turned red, and spoke the words, happy Birthday, Rosie. Me and Rosie both burst into tears before grabbing him for a big hug. And that's when I realized all those nights he spent alone, he was forcing out sounds and pushing through the pain, all for this moment.

My neighbor has six kids and I've never met a single one. The first time they left one of their blackout curtains open, I caught sight of all six sitting around the kitchen table eating just chicken and rice while the parents were eating a Turkey dinner. I tried to tell myself it was just a new parenting trend. But over the next few weeks, I started noticing other things. The house was always quiet, not a peep. When I tried to make friendly neighbor conversation with the parents, I'd give one word answers and hurry inside. My best friend said I needed to stop being nosy. Some families are private, she said. Remember the rednecks? They were weird, but their kids turned out fine. But I'd raised three kids of my own and nothing about that house felt fine. It was 2 a. M. When my dog started barking at something outside. I jumped to the window and saw all six kids marching in their backyard like tiny soldiers. The father stood watching with his arms crossed while the mother blew a sharp whistle that made them all freeze again. Do it again until it's perfect, the father barked. The children immediately resumed their positions and started over. When one of the smaller ones stumbled, all six had to start again from the beginning. The next night, I deliberately stayed up to watch. Sure enough, 2:00am came and there they were. Again, this time doing jumping jacks in unison while quietly chanting something I couldn't make out. It sounded like the American Pledge of allegiance but distorted. The youngest couldn't have been older than 5 years old. Struggling to keep up, exhausted, I started paying closer attention to anyone who might have seen these kids, which is when the Amazon delivery driver whispered to me, those kids scat. They're like roaches when the porch light comes on. Never seen anything like it. A quick search online showed the parents weren't registered as homeschoolers in our state. Despite the kids never leaving the house, I started documenting everything with my phone. One night, I caught them all doing wall sits against the house at 3 a. M, their legs shaking from exhaustion while the mother timed them with a stopwatch. The next morning, I followed their grocery delivery to see what they were feeding these exhausted children. The shopkeeper noticed me watching and said they order the exact same thing every week, 40 pounds of rice, cases of protein powder and beans. Nothing a kid would want. That Tuesday, I was ready with my camera when I saw headlights approaching the it's filed into the white van silently. The license plate was conveniently covered with MUD. I sat on my kitchen floor for two hours while on hold with 9 1 1 until the van returned. Each child walked out wearing a different outfit than before, looking dazed. The youngest was limping. One boy had fresh bruises on his legs that weren't there before. I took a photo of each of their faces and breathed a sigh of relief. I finally had enough evidence to call CPS. They picked up on the 11th ring. I need someone to check on the family now next door. I think these children are being abused. There was a long pause. Ma'am, we've already done three home visits on that house. They're just a strict family. Please stop calling or we'll have to report you for harassment. Well, I was done asking for permission. I waited until I saw the parents leave one morning and snuck into their backyard. The garage side door was unlocked. My heart hammered so hard I could hear it in my ears. But those kids needed someone to fight for them. I pushed the door open and stepped inside.

I thought I was imagining things at first. Me and my girlfriend Rachel were sitting on the living room floor with 10 month old Emma trying to get her to say anything. You know how it is with babies. You make all those stupid faces and weird sounds hoping they'll copy you. Rachel was doing the classic mama, mama, mama thing while waving her hands around like a complete maniac. I was on the other side doing my best dad voice going Dada, Dada, come on, sweetie. Emma just sat there in her little pink onesie chewing on her fingers and staring at us like we were the biggest idiots on the planet, which let's be honest, we probably were. Then my phone buzzed with another YouTube notification. I've been binge watching this tech review channel all week and apparently I'd forgotten to turn off notifications. Without thinking, I grabbed my phone and set out. God, I need to unsubscribe from this guy. Emma's head snapped toward me. Her eyes went wide. Then clear as day she looked right at me and said unsubscribe. Perfect pronunciation, three syllables like she'd been practicing. Rachel stopped mid mama and stared. I dropped my phone. We both looked at Emma who had this huge grin on her face like she knew she'd just blown our minds. She clapped her little hands together and said it again, unsubscribe. Pediatrician told us it was Perfectly normal. Kids pick up whatever words they hear most often. And apparently I've been saying unsubscribe way more than either Mama or Dada. That week, Rachel was not happy. She kept giving me these dirty looks like it was somehow my fault our daughter's first word was a YouTube feature instead of something sweet and meaningful. But here's where it gets weird. Emma became obsessed with that word. She he'd crawl around the house saying unsubscribe to everything, the cat, her toys, the TV. When she was hungry, instead of crying, she'd look at her empty bottle and say unsubscribe like she was canceling her milk subscription. Two weeks later, I'm at target with Emma in the cart. He's being super good, just sitting there playing with her little stuffed elephant. Then this random lady walks up, you know the type, the one who thinks every baby in public belongs to everyone. She starts making baby talk at Emma, doing that high pitched voice thing. Oh, what a cute little girl. Can you say hi to me, sweetie? Can you wave? Emma looks at this lady for a second, tilts her head and then says in the clearest voice ever, unsubscribe. Lady's face went from sweet grandma mode to completely confused. She looked at me like I'd taught my baby to curse at strangers. I just shrugged and said she's very selective about her content. But the real kicker came last month. Rachel's mom was over for dinner and She's always been one of those people who thinks she knows better than everyone about everything. She kept trying to feed Emma these organic baby food pouches that cost like $5 each, going on and on about how regular baby food is full of chemicals and we're poisoning our child. Emma was in her high chair, completely ignoring the fancy organic carrot puree her grandma was trying to shove in her mouth. She kept turning her head away and making this annoyed face. Finally, after about 10 minutes of this back and forth, Emma looked her grandma dead in the eye and said, unsubscribe. With the most serious expression I've ever seen on a baby. Rachel's mom stopped mid spoon and asked what she said. Emma said it again, louder this time, unsubscribe. I started laughing so hard I almost choked on my pasta. Rachel was trying not to laugh, but I could see her shoulders shaking. Her mom looked absolutely mortified, like Emma had just told her to get lost in the rudest way possible, which honestly, she kind of had. Emma had figured out that unsubscribe meant I don't want this anymore and she was using it to opt out of situations she didn't like. It was actually brilliant.

In the video, my husband and my son were with her. And my son was hugging her, saying he wished she could be his mother. I stared at my phone in complete shock, watching my eight year old tell another woman he wanted her as his mom. My birthday cake sat untouched on the kitchen counter. Thirty two candles melted into colorful puddles of wax. The balloons I'd hung that morning mocked me from the ceiling. Instead of crying like the old me I've done, I did something that would change everything forever. I called my lawyer first. Jennifer, it's Paisley. I need those divorce papers we discussed last month. Tonight. I don't care what time it is, Paisley. It's almost ten PM. What the hell happened? He. I've been secretly taking Ethan to see his ex girlfriend Marisa behind my back for months. I have video proof of everything. Jesus. I'll have the papers ready by morning. Then I called my bank's emergency hotline. Account freeze, credit cards canceled immediately. The joint savings we'd carefully built over 10 years of marriage locked down tighter than Fort Knox. By the time Marcus finally walked through our front door at midnight, smelling like her perfume, I had already filed for emergency custody, called a locksmith, change every lock in the house, and methodically packed all His belongings into black garbage bags lined up by the front door like a funeral procession. Hey, babe, sorry so ridiculously late tonight, he said casually, fumbling with his house key that no longer worked. Little Ethan fell asleep in the car again. He finally looked up from his phone and saw the divorce papers spread across our coffee table like evidence at a crime scene. How was your wonderful day with Marissa? I asked, voice steady and cold as winter ice. His face went completely white. The color drained so fast I genuinely thought he might collapse and faint right there. Paisley, sweetheart, I can explain everything. It's really not what you think it is. Save your explanations for the judge tomorrow morning. You're officially served. I handed him the thick custody papers with trembling hands. His fingers shook violently as he read the emergency restraining order. Our son Ethan appeared in the doorway, rubbing his sleepy eyes, still wearing the expensive new jacket I'd never seen before in my life. Mom, what's happening? Why are all of Dad's sitting outside in bags? Your father forgot it was my birthday today, honey. But he certainly remembered to take you to see his ex girlfriend instead. Ethan's little face crumpled with confusion. She said she was just Dad's old friend from college. She bought me ice cream and told me. What exactly did she tell you, baby? That maybe someday we could all live together like one big happy family. Marcus grabbed my arm desperately, his grip almost painful. You can't just destroy and tear our entire family apart over this one thing. I already did. Now the courts will decide who Ethan really belongs with. His confident smirk, the same one he'd worn for years whenever I questioned his suspicious late nights, vanished completely when he realized I wasn't the same naive woman who used to wait up for him every single night with dinner warming in the oven. Paisley, please be reasonable. We can work this whole thing out between us. Marissa honestly means absolutely nothing to me. I pulled out my phone and played the damming video again. Really? Because she apparently has dozens of videos of you two together going back six months. Beach trips, romantic dinner dates, family photos with my son. How did you even. She sent it by complete accident. Meant to send it to her sis

There's this guy in my neighborhood who started stealing my packages about two months ago. At first I thought it was just bad luck when my new headphones went missing. Then my coffee maker disappeared, then a birthday gift for my mom. After the fourth theft, I started tracking delivery times, obsessively trying to grab packages the second they arrived. But this guy was watching, too. I'd check the delivery notification rush outside, five minutes later, and the package would already be gone. I saw him once. He was in his mid 30s, baseball cap, driving a beat up Toyota Corolla that he'd park one street over before walking to my house. He wasn't even subtle about it. He'd stroll up my driveway in broad daylight like he owned the place. I put up a no trespassing sign. He took that, too. I added a mile you're on camera sign even though I didn't have cameras yet. The next day, that sign was in my recycling bin. That's when things got personal. He started leaving sticky notes on my door after stealing packages. The first one said, thanks for the Bluetooth speaker, sucker, with a smiley face drawn on it. The next time, after taking my workout supplements, he left a note saying, maybe try working out your brain instead. He was taunting me when he stole my girlfriend's anniversary gift. He actually had the nerve to leave a note saying she's too good for someone who can't even protect a package. Nice choice on the earrings though. That one made my blood boil. I tried everything having packages delivered to my work, but my boss shut that down. Amazon lockers were always full. I asked neighbors to grab them, but they were during the day too. The worst part was when he stole my diabetic cat's special food delivery and left a note thanks for the feast, dummy. My cat had to go without his food for 3 days while I waited for a replacement. I was literally trapped. I couldn't order anything to my own home. This guy was controlling my life and he was enjoying every second of it. I finally hit my limit when he stole my grandmother's medication that I'd ordered for her. The note said Hope Granny's not in a rush. Lol that was it. I went to the police station with all the sticky notes as evidence. The officer took my report, said they'd investigate, and told me package theft was unfortunately common. They'd increase patrols, they said. They'd keep an eye out, they said. But we both knew nothing would happen. It was just petty theft to them, a property crime that wasn't worth resources. I went home furious and started researching my options online. My first thought was a glitter bomb or die pack, but then I found forums discussing package Protection. Turns out booby trapping packages is illegal. You can actually get sued or arrested for injuring a thief. Even a harmless glitter bomb could technically be considered assault. I was about to give up when I stumbled across a post from a lawyer explaining that tampering with federal mail is a serious federal crime, not just petty theft. Federal mail includes anything sent through USPS with proper postage. The penalties were severe, up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. That's when my plan started forming. I invested in a high quality security camera system with clear night vision and motion detection, spending nearly $500 I couldn't really afford. I made sure one camera had a perfect angle of my driveway where cars would pass. Then I prepared my trap. I ordered a cheap item from eBay, but specifically requested USPS Priority Mail shipping. When it arrived, I carefully opened it from the bottom, keeping the federal mail label intact and visible. I placed the original

So I'm 23, oldest of five kids and basically running my parents house like I'm the damn manager or something. I'm in school full time getting my second degree, plus I work part time in my field. My employer already said they'll take me full time once I graduate. So I'm making decent money for a student, enough to pay for school and actually save some cash. My siblings are 20, 17, 14 and 10. My parents both work. Dad pulls crazy long hours and mom does the 9 to 5 grind at some stressful job. So guess who picks up all the slack? Me. I do literally everything. Grocery shopping every week, all the laundry for seven people, cooking dinner every single night and meal prep on Sunday so everyone has lunches ready. I even manage my siblings chores like making sure there's dog food in the pantry so my youngest brother can actually feed our two dogs or that we have poop bags on the leashes. It's like being a mom to four other people plus going to school. During Christmas break, I finally had enough saved up to buy myself a PS five. Been wanting one forever and I found one at regular price. But if you know anything about PS Fives in 2022 was basically winning the lottery. The rest of my family still shares this old PS four in the living room, but I Keep mine in my room. It's mine. I bought it and no, I don't share it. Well, my 20 year old brother Jake started whining to my parents about how unfair it was that I had all this money and cool stuff but wouldn't share. Like dude, get a job, but whatever. So my parents call me into the kitchen for this family meeting, which was basically them telling me I need to start paying rent. They said it wasn't fair that I was making good money while living there for free, especially when I won't even share my gaming console. I just sat there listening to them explain how much they wanted from me monthly. And I'm doing the math in my head. After rent I'd have maybe $800 left over each month. That's after buying my own food, gas, school supplies, everything. I went to my room and actually calculated it out on paper. If I dropped a couple classes next semester, I could go almost full time at work. It would only add one more year to my degree, but I could afford my own place. And here's the kicker, I'd actually have more free time and way more spending money than if I stayed home paying rent while doing everyone's chores. So I packed up my stuff. Everything I owned fit in my Honda Civic, which honestly was kind of depressing but also liberating. I didn't tell them I was leaving until I was loading my Car, where are you going? My mom asked standing in the driveway in her bathrobe. Getting my own place. Thanks for helping me realise I can afford it. I stayed at this Airbnb for 2 weeks while I figured out apartments, adjusted my class schedule and got more hours at work. The Airbnb host, this older lady named Beverly kept asking if I was okay because I was just so happy to be there. Like I was literally excited to do my own laundry and okay, I'm not gonna lie, I went a little crazy on dating apps. Living at home with four siblings and strict parents meant I hadn't had anyone over in like ever. Suddenly having my own space was like being let out of prison. I found this decent one bedroom apartment about 15 minutes from campus. Nothing fancy, but it has a dishwasher and in unit laundry, which felt like luxury after sharing one bathroom with six other people. The fallout was immediate. My parents had to give Jake all my old responsibilities. Poor guy went from just keeping his own room clean to grocery shopping, cooking dinner and managing everyone else's chores. The other three siblings got stuck with his old tasks split between them. Jake called me crying, literally crying because he had to break plans with his girlfriend Megan to meal prep for the week. Apparently mom and dad have this rule that girlfriends can't come over when they're not home. So he Couldn't even have her help. My 17 year old sister Emma texted me saying she now has to do laundry for 5 people every weekend and it's taking up her entire Saturday. The 14 year old has to walk both dogs twice a day instead of just feeding them. Even my 10 year old brother is mad because he has to help with dishes now. My parents kept calling saying I left them in the lurch and that I was being selfish. Dad actually said I was abandoning my family responsibilities, which was rich coming from someone who worked 12 hour days and never cooked a single meal. But here's the thing, I'm loving it. I bought myself a little succulent from IKEA and named it Gerald.

Can't have you scaring away the clientele anymore. I set down my gloves and left. My girlfriend was already prepared. Six hours later, the shop imploded. By evening, his voicemails turned to begging. I've been the lead artist at the local tattoo for four years. When I started, it was a dingy shop with expired ink and flash art nobody wanted. I transformed everything. Brought in proper autoclaves, designed custom this is that, got reposted thousands of times. Mentored apprentices who actually knew what cross contamination meant. Within eight months, my waitlist stretched two years out. When Bieber bought out his partner last September, everything changed. He'd make jokes about my type bringing down property values. He'd tell Walkins that maybe they'd be safer with Doug, the white kid he hired straight out of art school. When clients specifically requested me, Bieber would intercept them asking if they were sure they wanted to wait two years when Doug was available today. So on February 1st, Bieber called me into his office. A Confederate flag sticker peeked out from behind his filing cabinet. You're out, he said, feet up on his desk. Can't have you scaring away the clientele anymore. I stood there, still wearing my latex gloves from the session, watching him pick at his teeth with a business card. Doug can handle your books. He was always more talented than you. Anyway, Doug, who didn't know the difference between a mag and a round liner, right? I pulled off my gloves, set them on the sharps container and left. Didn't pack my drawings. Didn't say goodbye to my clients waiting outside. I'd just walked past the flash sheets I designed. My girlfriend Amara was assembling equipment in our garage when I got home. Beaver finally said the quiet part out loud. She asked when she saw me looking defeated. Said I was scaring away clientele. Her grin widened. Good. I've been waiting for this. Amara, I'm unemployed. The mortgage isn't going to pay itself. She turned her laptop toward me. That investment banker who's dragging back piece you finished last month. She's been emailing for weeks. Wants you to do her entire trading team before their company gala. Bieber intercepted everything. The email thread showed five executives each wanting elaborate pieces. 30,000 for two weeks work. She'd already reserved a private medical suite downtown for the sessions. My phone started buzzing. Bieber. I ignored it. Then Doug called, then the apprentice. Within minutes, I had 52 missed calls. Amara's phone rang. Her cousin worked at the emergency room. Bieber's shop. Put her on speaker. I said, Malik, you need to know what's happening. We've got four of Bieber's clients here. That new guy, Doug. He's been mixing expired ink with tap water to stretch supplies. The infections are severe. The first victim was a judge's daughter getting her law school graduation. Tattoo. Doug had attempted Lady Justice on her forearm. According to the nurse, the scales looked like scrambled eggs, the sword like a butter knife. The inflammation was spreading up her arm. My phone wouldn't stop. Bieber's voicemails grew increasingly frantic. First message, small hiccup here. Could use your input. Second, Malik, there's been an incident. Third, the health inspector is asking questions I can't answer. Amara's cousin called back an hour later. The judge's daughter's father just showed up. He's calling the health department, the medical board, his attorney. He saw the tattoo. Doug spelled justice wrong. More updates trickled in. Doug had attempted a

I stared at that crumpled twenty and two tens like they were aliens. My daughter Emma was only 7, and I had no clue whose kid I was supposedly feeding. The handwriting was neat, definitely an adult's. And the note was on some fancy stationery with little flowers on it. When Emma got home from school, I showed her the money and asked what was going on. She just shrugged and said, oh, that's from Becca's mom. Becca doesn't have lunch money this week, so I've been sharing my sandwich. My heart melted a little, but I was also confused. Why didn't this mom just pack her own kid lunch? The next morning, I decided to pack extra food just in case. Two sandwiches, two juice boxes, extra crackers. Emma didn't even question it. She just smiled and said, thanks, Dad. Becca will be so happy. I dropped her off at school and went to work, but I couldn't stop thinking about this Becca kid. That afternoon, I got a call from the school. Mister Williams, we need to discuss something with you about Emma. My stomach dropped. Did she get in trouble? Did something happen? I rushed over there expecting the worst. The principal, Missus Davis, sat me down in her office with this weird look on her face. Your daughter has been bringing extra food every day. This week and sharing with a classmate. We normally don't allow food sharing because of allergies, but we wanted to talk to you about the situation. First, she explained that Becca's family was going through a rough patch. Her mom worked three jobs but still couldn't afford school lunches. They'd applied for the free lunch program, but there was a waiting list. Meanwhile, Becca had been sitting at lunch with nothing but a water bottle. Emma apparently noticed on Monday and just started splitting everything in half, her sandwich, her apple slices, her cookies. She'd even been giving Becca her juice box and drinking from the water fountain instead. I was proud of my daughter but also heartbroken. No kid should go hungry at school. I told Missus Davis I wanted to keep packing extra food until Becca's free lunch kicked in. He smiled and said that would be fine, but mentioned that Becca's mom had been trying to find me to pay me back. That evening, there was a knock on our door. A woman in scrubs stood there looking exhausted. Are you Emma's dad? She asked nervously. I'm Janet, Becca's mom. I work at the hospital downtown. She looked like she hadn't slept in days. She pulled out a worn envelope and tried to hand it to me. I know $40 isn't enough for all the food Emma's been sharing, but it's all I have right now. I get paid again on Friday. Her voice was shaking and I could see she was embarrassed. I gently push the envelope back toward her. Keep it. Emma wants to share and we have plenty. Janet started crying right there on my doorstep. She explained that her husband had left six months ago, stuck her with all the debt, and she was working as a nurse aid cleaning lady and doing Doordash at night just to pay rent. That's when I had an idea. What time do you get home from your hospital job? I asked. Usually around 5:30, she said, wiping her eyes. Would you and Becca like to come over for dinner tonight? Emma would love to have her friend over. Janet looked shocked. I can't ask you to do that, but I insisted. An hour later, she showed up with Becca, a shy little girl with the brightest smile. The kids ran off to play while Janet and I talked in the kitchen. Turns out Janet was actually a registered nurse, but the only full time position she could find was across town with terrible hours. She'd been applying everywhere but kept getting rejected. I mentioned that my company's medical office was hiring nurses and their hours were perfect for single parents. Two weeks later, Janet got the job. She was able to quit her other two jobs and actually be home with Becca in the evenings.

So I'm 23, oldest of five kids and basically running my parents house like I'm the damn manager or something. I'm in school full time getting my second degree, plus I work part time in my field. My employer already said they'll take me full time once I graduate. So I'm making decent money for a student, enough to pay for school and actually save some cash. My siblings are 20, 17, 14 and 10. My parents both work. Dad pulls crazy long hours and mom does the 9 to 5 grind at some stressful job. So guess who picks up all the slack? Me. I do literally everything. Grocery shopping every week, all the laundry for seven people, cooking dinner every single night and meal prep on Sunday so everyone has lunches ready. I even manage my siblings chores like making sure there's dog food in the pantry so my youngest brother can actually feed our two dogs or that we have poop bags on the leashes. It's like being a mom to four other people plus going to school. During Christmas break, I finally had enough saved up to buy myself a PS five. Been wanting one forever and I found one at regular price. But if you know anything about PS Fives in 2022 was basically winning the lottery. The rest of my family still shares this old PS four in the living room, but I Keep mine in my room. It's mine. I bought it and no, I don't share it. Well, my 20 year old brother Jake started whining to my parents about how unfair it was that I had all this money and cool stuff but wouldn't share. Like dude, get a job, but whatever. So my parents call me into the kitchen for this family meeting, which was basically them telling me I need to start paying rent. They said it wasn't fair that I was making good money while living there for free, especially when I won't even share my gaming console. I just sat there listening to them explain how much they wanted from me monthly. And I'm doing the math in my head. After rent I'd have maybe $800 left over each month. That's after buying my own food, gas, school supplies, everything. I went to my room and actually calculated it out on paper. If I dropped a couple classes next semester, I could go almost full time at work. It would only add one more year to my degree, but I could afford my own place. And here's the kicker, I'd actually have more free time and way more spending money than if I stayed home paying rent while doing everyone's chores. So I packed up my stuff.

So I gave him the 1950s housewife he wanted. I had been with Craig for three years when he completely ruined my promotion dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. Women today are the problem with everything, he said, twirling his pasta. They don't know how to be real women anymore. They're always trying to wear the pants, competing with men instead of serving them. My grandpa had it right. His woman stayed home, cooked his meals, and didn't talk back. My wine glass stopped halfway to my mouth. Craig, we are literally here to celebrate my promotion. That's exactly what I mean. You care more about your stupid job than making me happy. Back in the day, women knew their place and kept their man satisfied. I looked around the restaurant where we were supposed to be celebrating my success. So you want a traditional relationship? Like the actual 1950s? His eyes lit up. Finally you get it. Yes. A real woman who acts like a woman should, the way god intended. Okay, traditional it is. He reached over to grab my hand. See, I knew you would understand. Most women would get all feminist and defensive about this. The next morning, I showed up to breakfast in a full 1950s housewife outfit, complete with pearls and a puffy dress that covered my ankles. Good morning, Mister. Anderson, I said, putting his coffee down. He laughed. Okay, the outfit is cute. But you don't have to call me that. Oh, but I do. In the 1950s, a proper lady always addresses her man respectfully. His smile started to fade that evening when he wanted to go to his friend's party. I shook my head. Oh, no, Mr. Anderson. I can't share a car with you. We're not married. People would think I'm a prostitute. What? That's insane. In the 1950s, unmarried couples needed chaperones. I will have to take the bus and meet you there. The bus? Just get in the car. That would make me a loose woman, Mister Anderson. He had to explain to everyone at the party why we arrived separately. At the party, his friend Kyle asked about my promotion. I turned to Craig. May I answer him, Mister Anderson? Craig's face went red. Just talk to him. As you wish. I turned to Kyle. Mister Anderson doesn't believe women should work. I will be quitting my job soon to focus on cooking and cleaning like a real woman. My mother failed to teach me that my only value is serving a man. Kyle nearly choked on his beer. Dude, what the hell? She's being stupid. Craig muttered. No. Mister Anderson believes modern women are broken. We think we deserve Equality when we should be grateful men even put up with us. I sat quietly, hands folded, only speaking when Craig gave permission. His friends kept staring at him. The real entertainment started at his company picnic. When his boss's wife asked about my job, I smiled sweetly. Mister Anderson says careers make women forget how to be women. Would you like my potato salad recipe instead? It's the only thing I'm for. I spent the entire event walking three steps behind Craig, staring at the ground, calling him Mr. Anderson, and asking his permission for everything. May I have a hot dog, Mr. Anderson? Just the damn hot dog. Is that a yes? I need you to say yes or no. His co workers started whispering. When someone asked why I kept calling him Mr. Anderson, I explained happily. Craig says modern women destroyed society by thinking they're equal to men. He wanted a traditional 1950s relationship where I knew my place. His boss overheard Craig. Did you really say that? She's twisting my words. Craig growled, oh, no. Mister Anderson was very clear. He said women should shut up, stay home, and give men sex on demand. The boss's face went ice cold. HR will want to discuss this on Monday, Craig. By Week 3, Craig was cracking. Can we please have sex? He asked one night. I gasped, clutching my pearls. Literally, Mister Anderson, good girls don't do that before marriage. What would Jesus think? We have been having sex for three years. That was the old me. The new traditional me saves herself for marriage. He punched a pillow. Then came his mother's birthday dinner at Craig's favorite steakhouse. When the waiter came, Over. I handed him my menu immediately. Mr. Anderson will order for me. Ladies don't talk to other men. Craig's mom's jaw dropped. Craig, what is going on? Your son wanted a traditional 1950s relationship, I explained, looking down shyly. He says modern women ruined everything by having jobs and

There's this guy in my neighborhood who started stealing my packages about two months ago. At first I thought it was just bad luck when my new headphones went missing. Then my coffee maker disappeared, then a birthday gift for my mom. After the fourth theft, I started tracking delivery times obsessively, trying to grab package is the second they arrived. But this guy was watching, too. I'd check the delivery notification rush outside, five minutes later, and the package would already be gone. I saw him once. He was in his mid 30s, baseball cap, driving a beat up Toyota Corolla that he'd park one street over before walking to my house. He wasn't even subtle about it. He'd stroll up my driveway in broad daylight like he owned the place. I put up a no trespassing sign. He took that, too. I added a smile you're on camera sign even though I didn't have cameras yet. The next day, that sign was in my recycling bin. That's when things got personal. He started leaving sticky notes on my door after stealing packages. The first one said, thanks for the Bluetooth speaker, sucker, with a smiley face drawn on it. The next time, after taking my workout supplements, he left a note saying, maybe try working out your brain instead. He was taunting me when he stole my girlfriend's anniversary gift. He actually had the nerve to leave a note saying she's too good for someone who can't even protect a package. Nice choice on the earrings though. That one made my blood boil. I tried everything having packages delivered to my work, but my boss shut that down. Amazon lockers were always full. I asked neighbors to grab them, but they work during the day too. The worst part was when he stole my diabetic cat's special food delivery and left a note. Thanks for the feast, dummy. My cat had to go without his prescription food for three days while I waited for a replacement. I was literally trapped. I. I didn't order anything to my own home. This guy was controlling my life and he was enjoying every second of it. I finally hit my limit when he stole my grandmother's medication that I'd ordered for her. The note said Hope Granny's not in a rush. Lol. That was it. I went to the police station with all the sticky notes as evidence. The officer took my report, said they'd investigate, and told me package theft was unfortunately common. They'd increase patrols, they said. They'd keep an eye out, they said. But we both knew nothing would happen. It was just petty theft to them, a property crime that wasn't worth their resources. I went home furious and started researching my options online. My first thought was a glitter bomb or dye pack, but then I found forums. Discussing package protect. Turns out booby trapping packages is illegal. You can actually get sued or arrested for injuring a thief. Even a harmless glitter bomb could technically be considered assault. I was about to give up when I stumbled across a post from a lawyer explaining that tampering with federal mail is a serious federal crime, not just petty theft. Federal mail includes anything sent through USPS with proper postage. The penalties were severe, up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. That's when my plan started forming. I invested in a high quality security camera system with clear night vision and motion detection, spending nearly $500 I couldn't really afford. I made sure one camera had a perfect angle of my driveway where cars would pass. Then I prepared my trap. I ordered a cheap item from eBay, but specifically requested USPS Priority Mail shipping. When it arrived, I carefully opened it from the bottom, keeping the federal mail label intact and visible. I placed the original item inside a larger Amazon box, then put that Amazon box inside another package, making it look like a typical Amazon delivery. But underneath, clearly visible if anyone looked was that USPS label.

Meet my French husband and waste your time. So my mom and I were in Paris last month, and she just told me this absolutely legendary story that I had to share. My mom is like the nicest person alive to strangers, especially sales people. She's the type who will stand there for an hour listening to some pushy sales person because she doesn't wanna be rude. My dad passed away a few years back, but he was born in Egypt and spoke perfect French and Arabic before learning English when he moved to the U S. Back in 1976, when my parents were newlyweds, they took a trip to Paris. My mom collects stamps, which I know sounds super nerdy, but whatever. She wanted to buy some French plate blocks for her collection and was planning to drop like, three or four hundred dollars, which was a lot of money back then. She. She left my dad napping at the hotel and walked to this post office about a block away. The line was insanely long, but she waited patiently because that's just how she is. When she finally got to the front counter, the woman behind it looked at her and said in perfect English that she didn't speak English. My mom was confused, but okay, whatever. Maybe she misunderstood. So she waited for another employee to become free. This took forever, and when the second woman finally became available, she Was straight up nasty to my mom, rolling her eyes, telling her she couldn't help her, couldn't sell her, this was out of stock. Of that, just being completely rude and dismissive. My mom said she was almost in tears because she couldn't understand why this woman was being so mean when she was just trying to buy stamps. But here's where it gets good. My mom is usually a pushover, but something about this situation just set her off. She decided she was going to get revenge. She walked back to the hotel and woke up my dad, who was still taking his nap. She explained what happened and asked him to come with her to the post office. They got back there, and my mom waited until that same rude woman was available. Then she had my dad start talking to the woman in perfect French. He told her that my mom wanted the plate block from every single set of stamps they had in the entire post office. Woman's attitude completely changed when she realized my dad spoke fluent French. But she had already been caught being terrible, so she couldn't really back out. For those who don't know stamps, when you remove the plate block from a sheet, the remaining stamps have to be counted by hand, one by one. It's super tedious and time consuming. The woman had to go through every single stamp design they had and remove the plate blocks. She was pulling Them from sheet after sheet, making this huge stack while my dad and mom just stood there watching. This went on for, like, 30 minutes. The woman kept glancing at the clock because it was getting close to closing time. She had plate blocks from literally every stamp design in the entire post office stacked up on the counter.

Cassidy dumped me for my best friend Braden at prom entrance. And it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. Which I didn't know was that I'd already spent $400 on matching burgundy outfits she begged for. Can't January. I've been working doubles at a pizza joint every weekend. Had her dad's blessing to ask her to be my prom queen. Even practice my speech in the car during lunch breaks like an idiot. But when I showed up at her house that Friday night in the burgundy tux for sale, shaking in my hands, her mom's face told me everything. Honey, she already left with Braden. I sat on the porch with my head in my heads when I realized what was happening. But I drove to the venue anyway, thinking maybe her mom was confused. Nope. I found them at the entrance. Cassidy wearing the burgundy dress I bought, but with his cheap gold corsage on her wrist. She looked at me with zero emotion. Braden and I have been together for months.

I kept thinking about that Stanford scholarship I've been planning to decline to stay near her. Maybe I didn't have to anymore. As soon as I walked in, something strange happened. People started surrounding me. Not with pity, but actual anger at them. My younger sister dragged me to the dance floor. Everyone saw what they did. Everyone thinks they're trash. Then I saw Cassidy standing by the punch bowl by herself, pretending to text. Someone grabbed my hand right then. It was Brandon's ex. He's outside with someone else right now. He's been playing Cassidy since day one, just like he did with me. We danced a bit while Cassidy watched from across the room, her face getting redder with each song. Things got crazy, though when they announced Prom Court and the DJ actually called my name for king. The entire gym went bomb bonkers. Cassidy didn't even make court, despite campaigning for months with homemade cookies and promises. She tried to hug me during the crowning, but I walked past her to dance with the Queen. Things were only going to get better, though. Everyone went to a huge after party, where I met this cute girl from another high school. I couldn't believe that she was also heading to Stanford for pre med. She also couldn't stop laughing at my story about getting dumped at the door, which made me like her more, to be honest. We talked until sunrise about everything except Cassidy. Meanwhile, Braden Had returned from wherever he was, and Cassidy left crying when she saw lipstick on his collar. Her best friend told me later that she'd been posting and deleting messages all night, trying to make it look like she was having fun. Three weeks later, my phone wouldn't stop buzzing. At two in the morning, 27 messages from Cassidy. I went to his house, and another girl answered the door. He's been with three other people this whole time. You were the only real thing I had. The funny thing was, Cassidy thought she was upgrading when she

Macy was 13 when she started sacrificing her own life to save her little sisters. Zada had a plastic anemia, meaning she needed extra blood, bone marrow, even organs. By 16, Macy had donated over 500 pints of blood, had Cork screws drilled into her for bone marrow six times, even gave Zeta a kidney and six 2% of her liver. At 18, she was down to 87 pounds, taking 23 pills a day to keep her remaining organs functioning. Her dream of motherhood was dead. Her immune system was destroyed, and her bones fractured upon the slightest impact. But I was alive, thriving, and living the teenage life Macy gave up. Two years later, Macy got diagnosed with lymphoma. Doctors said it was likely the extreme stress she put her body through. And yet Macy didn't cry or didn't complain. All she asked for was one thing. When cancer patients finish their last treatment, they ring this brass bell in the main lobby. Three rings to say you survived. Macy had watched dozens of people ring it. Their families would cry and cheer. She wanted that for once. She wanted to be the one being celebrated for surviving. She texted the family group chat, June 15th, they let me ring the remission bell. Would mean the world if you could be there. Zada instantly responded with heart emojis. The whole family promised they'd be there. The morning of June 15th. Macy Did her makeup for the first time in two years and even styled what was left of her hair.

At 2:45, Macy was sitting in the lobby watching the main entrance, her hands shaking from excitement. But at three PM, there was nobody there. The bell coordinator asked if she was ready. Just one more minute, Macy said. They're probably just parking. At 3:05, Macy texted the group, hey, I'm at the bell waiting for you. Zada read it but gave no response. Macy called her and got nothing. She called mom and got the same, but her dad answered, hey, sweetie, what's up? Zada was laughing in the background. Dad, I'm at the hospital. The bell ceremony. There was a pause. Oh, crap, honey, that's today. Hey, we threw Zada a college acceptance party. She got into Berkeley, full ride. Macy's legs gave out. She sat down hard on the lobby bench. Zada's party? Her voice was tiny. Yeah, it was a surprise thing. She wanted to celebrate getting into pre med. You know, following in your footsteps. Helping people like you helped her. Then Zeta shouted into the phone, is that Macy? Tell her we'll celebrate with her later. Dad, Macy whispered, I'm at my last cancer treatment. The bell ceremony. I texted everyone. You all said you'd come. Oh, Honey, you know how bad I am with texts. Ring the bell and have someone video it. We'll watch it later. He hung up. The lobby was now full of other patients and families, all watching this girl in a yellow dress sitting alone. Macy stood up slowly and walked to the bell. She was supposed to ring it three times, but she rang it once. A few people clapped awkwardly, and that's when the tears started coming. Pamela, the head nurse, who'd been with Macy every. Every step of the way, ran over and pulled her into a hug. I gave her everything. I gave her my body, Macy cried. I can't have kids because of it.

Can't have you scaring away the clientele anymore. I set down my gloves and left. My girlfriend was already prepared. Six hours later, the shop imploded. By evening, his voicemails turned to begging. I've been the lead artist at the local tattoo for four years. When I started, it was a dingy shop with expired ink and flash art nobody wanted. I transformed everything. Brought in proper autoclaves, designed custom pieces that got reposted thousands of times, mentored apprentices who actually knew what cross contamination meant. Within eight months, my wait list stretched two years out. But when Bieber bought out his partner last September, everything changed. He'd make jokes about my type bringing down property values. He'd tell Walkins that maybe they'd be safer with Doug, the white kid he hired right out of art school. When clients specifically requested me, Bieber would intercept them, asking if they were sure they wanted to wait two years when Doug was available today. So on February 1st, Bieber called me into his office. A Confederate flag sticker peeked out from behind his filing cabinet. You're out, he said, feet up on his desk. Can't have you scaring away the clientele anymore. I still there, still wearing my latex gloves from the session, watching him pick at his teeth with a business card. Doug can handle your books. He was always more talented than you anyway. Doug, who didn't know the difference Between a mag and a round liner. Right. I pulled off my gloves, set them on the sharps container and left. Didn't pack my drawings. Didn't say goodbye to my clients waiting outside. Just walked past the flash sheets I designed. My girlfriend Amara was assembling equipment in our garage when I got home. Bieber finally said the quiet part out loud. She asked when she saw me looking defeated. Said I was scaring away clientele. Her grin widened. Good. I've been waiting for this. Amara, I'm unemployed. The mortgage isn't going to pay itself. She turned her laptop toward me. That investment banker who's dragging back you finished last month. She's been emailing for weeks. Wants you to do her entire trading team before their company gala. Bieber intercepted everything. The email thread showed five executives each wanting elaborate pieces. 30,000 for two weeks work. She'd already reserved a private medical suite downtown for the sessions. My phone started buzzing. Bieber. I ignored it. Then Doug called, then the apprentice. Within minutes, I had 52 missed calls. Amara's phone rang. Her cousin worked at the emergency room. Your Bieber's shop. Put her on speaker. I said, Malik, you need to know what's happening. We've got four of Bieber's clients here. That new guy, Doug. He's been mixing expired ink with tap water to stretch supplies. The infections are severe. The first victim was a judge's daughter getting her law school graduation tattoo. Doug had attempted Lady Justice on her. Forearm. According to the nurse, the scales looked like scrambled eggs. The sword like a butter knife. The inflammation was spreading up her arm. My phone wouldn't stop. Bieber's voicemails grew increasingly frantic. First message, small hiccup here. Could use your input. Second, Malik, there's been an incident. Third, the health inspector is asking questions I can't answer. Amara's cousin called back an hour later. The judge

So I gave him the 1950s housewife he wanted. I have been with Craig for three years when he completely ruined my promotion dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. Women today are the problem with everything, he said, twirling his pasta. They don't know how to be real women anymore. They're always trying to wear the pants, competing with men instead of serving them. My grandpa had it right. His woman stayed home, cooked his meals, and didn't talk back. My wine glass stopped halfway to my mouth. Craig, we are literally here to sell. Rate my promotion. That's exactly what I mean. You care more about your stupid job than making me happy. Back in the day, women knew their place and kept their man satisfied. I looked around the restaurant where we were supposed to be celebrating my success. So you want a traditional relationship, like the actual 1950s? His eyes lit up. Finally you get it. Yes. A real woman who acts like a woman should, the way god intended. Okay, traditional it is. Reached over to grab my hand. See? I knew you would understand. Most women would get all feminist and defensive about this. The next morning, I showed up to breakfast in a full 1950s housewife outfit, complete with pearls and a puffy dress that covered my ankles. Good morning, Mr. Anderson, I said, putting his coffee down. He laughed. Okay, the outfit is cute, but you don't Have to call me that. Oh, but I do. In the 1950s, a proper lady always addresses her man respectful. His smile started to fade. That evening, when he wanted to go to his friend's party. I shook my head. Oh no, Mister Anderson, I can't share a car with you. We're not married. People would think I'm a prostitute. What? That's insane. In the 1950s, unmarried couples needed chaperones. I will have to take the bus and meet you there. The bus? Just get in the car. That would make me a loose woman, Mister Anderson. He had to explain to everyone at the party why we arrived separately. At the party, his friend Kyle asked about my promotion. I turned to Craig. May I answer him, Mr. Anderson? Craig's face went red. Just talk to him. As you wish. I turned to Kyle. Mr. Anderson doesn't believe women should work. I will be quitting my job soon to focus on cooking and cleaning like a real woman. My mother failed to teach me that my only value is serving a man. Kyle nearly choked on his beer. Dude, what the hell? She's being stupid. Craig muttered. No. Mr. Anderson believes modern women are broken. We think we deserve Equality when we should be grateful men even put up with us. I sat quietly, hands folded, only speaking when Craig gave permission. His friends kept staring at him. The real entertainment started at his company picnic when his boss's Wife asked about my job. I smiled sweetly. Mr. Anderson says careers make women forget how to be women. Would you like my potato salad recipe instead? It's the only thing I'm good for. I spent the entire event walking three steps behind Craig, staring at the ground, calling him Mr. Anderson, and asking his permission for everything. May I have a hot dog, Mr. Anderson? Just take the damn hot dog. Is that a yes? I need you to say yes or no. His co workers started whispering. When someone asked why I kept calling him Mr. Anderson, I explained happily. Craig says modern women destroyed society by thinking they're equal to men. He wanted a traditional 1950s relationship where I knew my place. His boss overheard Craig, did you really say that? She's twisting my words. Craig growled, oh, no. Mr. Anderson was very clear. He said women should shut up, stay home, and give men sex on demand. The boss's face went ice cold.

I checked my daughter Kate's bank account and saw zeros where $300 should have been. Kate was 16 and worked 20 hours a week at a burger place, but somehow her entire paycheck had vanished. When Kate got home from her shift, I confronted her with the statement, I've been buying stuff for Zoe at school. She has a baby and nobody helps her, she explained. My first thought was that someone was running a sob story scam on my naive daughter. But Kate and sisted that Zoe desperately needed help and the baby would suffer without it. The next morning, I gave Kate extra cash and told her to give it to Zoe. Thanks, Mom. Zoe's going to cry when I give her this. That afternoon, I got a call from the school. We need to discuss something serious with you about Kate. Immediately. I rushed to the school, expecting the worst. Your daughter was seen in the parking lot giving another student prescription bottles in cash and what appeared to be a substance deal. We have zero tolerance for substances on school property, and we've already contacted the school resource officer. He turned his computer screen toward me to show the security footage of Kate handing Zoe two orange prescription bottles and money by her car. I felt sick realizing I've been giving Kate money that might have been funding prescription substance stealing. Mister Hayes, Said Kate claimed the prescriptions were antibiotics and diaper cream for a baby, but that sounded like a ridiculous lie to cover up selling pills. No teenager carries around multiple prescriptions for a baby they don't have, he said while shaking his head. That's when the school nurse walked in carrying a baby. He was coughing so hard his tiny body shook with each breath. This is Zoe's son, she said quietly while patting his back. She brought him to my office this morning because he ran out of his breathing medicine and she didn't know what else to do. The principal went completely silent. The nurse explained that Zoe was 16 and had been trying to finish school while raising a six month old baby alone. Her parents had kicked her out and she'd been living in her car for the past month. Prescriptions Kate gave her were antibiotics for the baby's lung infection and prescription diaper cream for an infected diaper rash that had gotten so bad it was bleeding. Kate had been using her own money to buy them because Zoe couldn't afford the copays. I was proud of my daughter, but also heartbroken. No teenage girl should be living in a car with a sick baby. I told Mr. Hayes I wanted to keep helping Zoe and asked where I could find her. He said she usually stayed in the parking lot after school until security made her leave. After school we found Zoe in the Parking lot, trying to change change her baby's diaper in the backseat of her car. She saw us coming and immediately started to panic like she was going to drive away. But Kate ran over before she could start the car. It's okay. This is my mom. She wants to help. Please don't call anyone. They'll take him away and he's all I have left. Zoe begged through the cracked window. The baby was wheezing so loud I could hear it from outside the car, and his little face looked gray. I convinced her to let me sit in the passenger seat so we could talk. She explain that they had been living in this car for over a month, and she washed the baby in gas station sinks at night when nobody was around. I asked about the baby's father and watched her whole body start shaking. His name is Nathan Brennan. His dad teaches chemistry here at school, she said so quietly I could barely hear her. I was 15 when Nathan invited me to his college party. He was 21 and kept giving me drinks and till I couldn't stand up straight. Then he rocked me. A few weeks later, when I told Nathan I was pregnant, he laughed in my face and said nobody would ever believe trash like me over him since he's premed at the university. She started sobbing and told us that his dad had cornered her after class one day. He grabbed My arm so hard it left bruise

Claimed she had this special mom intuition that other parents just didn't possess. Growing up, it was equal parts annoying and impressive. She'd catch me sneaking out before I even made it to the front door. She pack extra lunch money on random days that turned out to be exactly when I'd forget mine. She always seemed to know precisely what we needed when we needed it, like she could read our minds. It's a mother's gift, she say with this knowing smile. You'll understand when you have kids someday. But when I turned 18 and moved out for college, something started feeling really wrong about her supposedly supernatural abilities. She'd text me literally seconds after I got bad news, like the moment I hung up from a devastating phone call. She'd show up at my apartment with soup when I was getting sick before I told anyone I wasn't feeling well. She'd call my friends asking weirdly specific questions about my schedule, my relationships, where I've been spending my time. At first, I thought maybe she really did have some kind of sixth sense. Maybe being a mother for 18 years had fine tuned her instincts to an almost supernatural level. But Then the coincidences became too frequent, too precise, too impossible to explain away with maternal intuition alone. She knew about my breakup before I posted about it on social media. She knew I changed jobs before I told anyone in the family. She even knew about the minor fender Bender I had in a grocery store parking lot that I'd specifically decided not to mention to avoid worrying her unnecessarily. So this year for Mother's Day, I decided to test her psychic abilities in a very special way. I spent weeks meticulously preparing the perfect gift for her special day. I bought her a gorgeous antique jewelry box from her favorite vintage store downtown, the exact kind she'd been admiring and hinting about for months. But instead of filling it with the jewelry she was expecting, I put something much more meaningful and revealing inside. 23 devices total. Every single air tag I'd found sewn into my backpack, jacket linings and even my shoes. Three hidden cameras that had been disguised as phone chargers in my apartment, GPS trackers that were magnetically attached to my car in places I never would have thought to look. But that wasn't all. I also included detailed printouts of my phone records showing she'd somehow managed to clone my SIM card six months ago. Screenshots of the spy app she secretly installed on my laptop during Thanksgiving break, photos I taken of her car parked across the street from my workplace, my gym and Even outside my friend's houses, the documentation was thorough, organized and absolutely damming. Happy Mother's Day, mom. Open it up. I know you're going to absolutely love what's inside. I watched her face go through every possible human emotion as she opened that jewelry box. First, confusion as she saw the strange collection of electronics and recognition as she realized what she was looking at. shock as the full scope of her surveillance operation became clear. Finally, this weird guilty smile crept across her face like she'd been caught red handed but was still proud of her cleverness. Honey, listen, I can explain all of this. No need to explain. I interrupted, smiling sweetly. Your psychic powers are absolutely incredible, mom. You even somehow knew that I'd eventually figure out your little operation. She tried to laugh it off, nervously making some joke about being an overprotective, but I wasn't finished with my Mother's Day surprise yet. Oh, and there's one more thing, mom. Yesterday while you were at your book club meeting, I took the liberty of switching all those tracking devices over to Dad's stuff instead. You know, his car, his golf bag, his work laptop. Her face went completely white. your amazing psychic abilities might be very interested to know that according to your own it, a GPS tracking system, Dad's current location has been showing up at Jennifer Morrison's house every single Tuesday and Thursday afternoon for the past three months. Isn't that absolutely Fascinating information. The silence in the room was deafening. Her psychic powers definitely didn't see that plot twist coming.

I came home from my 12 hour nursing shift to find a BMW parked in my driveway, not blocking it, but fully in it, like the driver lived there. I parked on the street, exhausted and confused, and knocked on my neighbor's door to ask if they knew whose car it was. Nobody recognized it. The car was locked, no note, just sitting there like it belonged. I left a polite note on the windshield, hi, you're parked in my driveway. Please move your car. Thanks, and went to bed. The next morning, the car was still there, but my note was crumpled on my lawn. A new note was under my windshield wiper. Parking on the street is free. Deal with it. I was genuinely baffled. They were in my driveway but telling me to deal with it. I called the police, who said it was a civil matter since it was private property. They could only tow if it was blocking me in. I called towing companies, but they needed specific authorization forms that would take days to process. That evening, the owner finally appeared, a girl around 22, designer everything, walking from the direction of the college apartments two blocks away. She unlocked the BMW while I was watering my plants. Excuse me, this is my driveway, I said calmly. She looked at me. Like I was dirt. So? So you can't park here. The streets full. This spot was empty. It's not my problem you don't use your driveway efficiently. I don't use it efficiently because I was at work as a nurse, saving lives. She shrugged. Still not my problem. Maybe you should work different hours. She got got in her car and drove away. The audacity was breathtaking. But she'd made a critical error. She'd admitted this was her regular parking solution and she'd be back. I made some calls. The next morning, her BMW was back in my driveway. This time, I was ready. My friend Tony ran a moving company and owed me several favors from when I taken care of his mother in the ICU. He brought over four of those massive shipping containers. And position them perfectly around the BMW. Not touching it. That would be illegal. Just creating a perfect box around it with about 2 inches of clearance on each side. The containers were on my property. Completely legal. The BMW was now trapped in a metal fortress. I left a note. You said it wasn't your problem. Now it's your only problem. That evening, she was back, raining at my door. What did you do? I officially use my driveway space for storage. Not your problem. Right. Move them now. No, you can wait until I need the containers moved. Should be about 4 days. She called the police. They came, looked at the Situation and shrugged. Containers were on my property. The car was illegally parked. If anything, she was trespassing. They suggested she'd be grateful I hadn't had her towed. She tried everything. Her father, a lawyer, called, threatening to sue. I recorded the call where he admitted his daughter had parked illegally on my property. Her mother came by, offering to pay Amy. I declined. The girl herself tried breaking into the containers with various tools. My security cameras caught everything. Day two, she set up a tent next to her car. Day three, she started a social media campaign about the crazy neighbor holding her car hostage. It backfired when people pointed out she parked in someone else's driveway. Day four, she finally broke. Please. She. I begged, actually crying. I have a job interview. I need my car. I'm sorry I parked here. You're sorry you got caught, not sorry you did it? No, I'm actually sorry I've been parking in people's driveways all semester because I'm too

I'll tell another woman he wanted her as his mom. My birthday cake sat untouched on the kitchen counter. Thirty two candles melted into colorful puddles of wax.

He finally looked up from his phone and saw the divorce papers spread across our coffee table like evidence at a crime scene. How was your wonderful day with Marissa? I asked, my voice steady and cold as winter ice. His face went completely white. The color drained so fast I genuinely thought he might collapse and faint right there. Paisley, sweetheart, I can explain everything. It's really not what you think it is. Save your explanations for the judge tomorrow morning. You're officially served. I handed him the thick custody papers with trembling hands. His fingers shook violently as he read the emergency restraining order. Our son Ethan appeared in the doorway, rubbing his sleepy eyes, still wearing the expensive new jacket I'd never seen before in my life. Mom, what's happening? Why are all of Dad's clothes sitting outside in bags? Your father forgot it was my birthday today, honey. But he certainly remembered to take you to see his ex girlfriend instead. Ethan's little face crumpled with confusion. She said she was just Dad's old friend from college. She bought me ice cream and told me. What exactly did she tell you, baby? That maybe someday we could all live together. They're Like one big, happy family. Marcus grabbed my arm desperately, his grip almost painful. You can't just destroy and tear our entire family apart over this one thing. I already did. Now the courts will decide who Ethan really belongs with.

Cassidy dumped me for my best friend Braden at prom entrance. And it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. What she didn't know was that I'd already spent $400 on matching burgundy outfits he begged for. Can't January. I've been working doubles at a pizza joint every weekend. Had her dad's blessing to ask her to be my prom queen. Even practiced my speech in the car during lunch breaks like an idiot. But when I showed up at her house that Friday night in the burgundy tux corsage shaking in my hands, her mom's face told me everything. Honey, she already left with Braden. I sat on the porch with my head in my heads when I realized what was happening. But I drove to the venue anyway, thinking maybe her mom was confused. Nope. I found them at the entrance. Cassidy wearing the burgundy dress I'd bought, but with his cheap gold corsage on her wrist. She looked at me with zero emotion. Braden and I have been together for months. You were too busy with college applications to notice. Then my best friend, the guy who'd help me pick her corsage that morning, actually said, thanks for keeping her warm, bro. I handed my sixty dollar corsage to some terrified friend, freshman girl standing nearby, and walked into prom alone the whole time. I kept thinking about that Stanford scholarship I've been planning to decline to stay near her. Maybe I didn't have to anymore. As soon as I walked in, something strange happened. People started surrounding me. Not with pity, but actual anger at them. My younger sister dragged me to the dance floor. Everyone saw what they did. Everyone thinks they're trash. Then I saw Cassidy standing by the punch bowl by herself, pretending to text. But someone grabbed my hand right then. It was Brandon's ex. He's outside with someone else right now. He's been playing Cassidy since day one, just like he did with me. We danced while Cassidy watched from across the room, her face getting redder with each song. Things got crazy, though. When they announced Prom Court and the DJ actually called my name for king. The entire gym went bonkers. Cassidy didn't even make court, despite campaigning for months with homemade cookies and promises. She tried to hug me during the crowning, but I walked past her to dance with the queen. Things were only going to get better, though. Everyone went to a huge after party, where I met this cute girl from another high school. I couldn't believe that she was also heading to Stanford for pre med. She also couldn't stop laughing at my story about getting dumped at the door, which made me like her more, to be honest. We talked until sunrise about everything except Cassidy. Meanwhile, Braden had returned. From wherever he was. And Cassidy left crying when she saw lipstick on his collar. Her best friend told me later that she'd been posting and deleting messages all night, trying to make it look like she was having fun. Three weeks later, my phone wouldn't stop buzzing at two in the morning. 27 messages from Cassidy. I went to his house, and another girl answered the door. He's been with three other people this whole time. You were the only real

Why are all of Dad's clothes sitting outside in bags? Your father forgot it was my birthday today, honey. But he certainly remembered to take you to see his ex girlfriend instead. Ethan's little face crumpled with confusion. She said she was just Dad's old friend from college. She bought me ice cream and told me. What exactly did she tell you, baby? That maybe someday we could all live together like one. Big, happy family. Marcus grabbed my arm desperately, his grip almost painful. You can't just destroy and tear our entire family apart over this one thing. I already did. Now the courts will decide who Ethan really belongs with. His confident smirk, the same one he'd worn for years whenever I questioned his suspicious late nights, vanished completely when he realized I wasn't the same naive woman who used to wait up for him every single night with dinner warming in the oven. Paisley. Please be reasonable. We can work this whole thing out between us. Marissa honestly means absolutely nothing to me. I pulled out my phone and played the damming video again. Really? Because she apparently has dozens of videos of you two together going back.

Cassidy dumped me for my best friend Braden at prom entrance, and it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. What she didn't know was that I'd already spent $400 on matching burgundy outfits she begged for. Can't January. I've been working doubles at a pizza joint every weekend. Had her dad's blessing to ask her to be my prom queen. Even practiced my speech in the car during lunch breaks like an idiot. But when I showed up at her house that Friday night in the burgundy tux, massage shaking in my hands, her mom's face told me everything. Honey, she already left with Braden. I sat on the porch with my head in my heads when I realized what was happening. But I drove to the venue anyway, thinking maybe her mom was confused. Nope. I found them at the entrance. Cassidy wearing the burgundy dress I'd bought, but with his cheap gold corsage on her wrist. He looked at me with zero emotion. Braden and I have been together for months. You were too busy with college applications to notice. Then my best friend, the guy who'd help me pick her corsage that morning, actually said, thanks for keeping her warm, bro. I handed my 60 dollar corsage to some terrified freshman girl standing nearby and walked into prom alone. The whole time I Kept thinking about that Stanford scholarship. I've been planning to decline to stay near her. Maybe I didn't have to anymore. As soon as I walked in, something strange happened. People started surrounding me. Not with pity, but actual anger at them. My younger sister dragged me to the dance floor. Everyone saw what they did. Everyone thinks they're trash. Then I saw Cassidy standing by the punch bowl by herself, pretending to text. Someone grabbed my hand right then. It was Brandon's ex. He's outside with someone else right now. He's been playing Cassidy since day one, just like he did with me. We danced a bit while Cassidy watched from across the room, her face getting redder with each song. Things got crazy, though, when they announced Prom Court and the DJ actually called my name for king. Entire gym went bonkers. Cassidy didn't even make court, despite campaigning for months with homemade cookies and promises. She tried to hug me during the crowning, but I walked past her to dance with the Queen. Things were only going to get better, though. Everyone went to a huge after party, where I met this cute girl from another high school. I couldn't believe that she was also heading to Stanford for pre med. She also couldn't stop laughing at my story about getting dumped at the door, which made me like her more, to be honest. We talked until sunrise about everything except Cassidy. Meanwhile, Braden had returned from Wherever he was. And Cassidy left crying when she saw lipstick on his collar. Her best friend told me later that she'd been posting and deleting messages all night, trying

I showed her what good enough really means. Catherine's mother thinks I'm too poor to marry her daughter. Last week she cornered me in their kitchen while Catherine was in the bathroom. She press $300 into my hand for gas money. I know bartending doesn't pay much. She thinks I work at a dive bar. Catherine's tried explaining I planned corporate events, but her mother won't listen. Same thing, serving drinks to people. That night, I looked up her charity gala. I had eight months to prove her wrong. I started volunteering at her charity, but at a different location across town. She'd never check on volunteers. At Catherine's birthday dinner, her mother brought up the charity gala again. It's $5,000 a plate. We understand if you can't afford it. Catherine started to explain. I'd already bought tickets. How sweet, her mother interrupted. But real donors give more than just attendance. I smiled and stayed quiet. Catherine squeezed my hand under the table. Exhausted from defending me. Her mother leaned over to her sister. Some people belong at galas. Others serve at them. They both laughed. Catherine's eyes filled with tears. That's when I decided to show them who really didn't belong. The insults got worse every week. At her sister's engagement party, she introduced me as Catherine's friend who bartends. When Catherine corrected her, she laughed. Right. You serve appetizers, too. Then her father jumped in. During their Anniversary dinner, he pulled me aside. I know someone hiring bar managers. 40,000 a year. Real stability. He showed me a job listing on his phone. Catherine overheard and got angry. She doesn't need your help. Her mother shot back. Stop defending her. Love doesn't pay bills. What they didn't know was that I actually managed events for Fortune 500 companies. I made six figures. But I never told them because they never really asked. The charity location I volunteered at needed help with donor management. Within weeks, I was running their fundraising. The director loved my work. She had no idea I was engaged to Catherine. Then I almost got caught. Catherine saw an email on my phone from the charity thanking me for raising so much money. Why are they emailing you? My heart stopped. I told her my company was sponsoring some tables. She believed it. Her mother got meaner. At Thanksgiving, she made me sit at the kids table. You'll be more comfortable there. When I tried to sit with Catherine, she announced, we're discussing family finances. Family only. Catherine stood to leave with me. Her mother grabbed her arm. Think about your future. I almost gave up that night. Sat in my car crying. Maybe Catherine would be happier without me. Then my phone buzzed. Three of my corporate clients wanted to donate to the charity. $200,000 total because of my connections. Christmas was the worst. Her mother invited Catherine's ex boyfriend. Remember Gregory? He Just made partner at his law firm. She actually made me serve drinks to the guests. Since you're so good at it. Gregory spent the night talking about his vacation home while her mother smiled at him. I kept volunteering. I kept raising money. In eight months, I brought in half a million dollars. I also donated 50,000 of my own money. I listed it under my full legal name, Victoria. Catherine's mother only knew me as Tori. The week before the gala, I overheard her mother on the phone. Once she sees Tori at the gala surrounded by successful people, Catherine will understand the difference. Charity director pulled me aside. The board knows who you are. Your future mother in law is in for a surprise. She winked. At the pre gala reception, Catherine's mother grabbed my arm. Stay close to us. These people don't like party crashers. Her friends smirked. Trust me, I whispered to Catherine. Her mother announced loudly, don't worry, I'll introduce them to everyone. They won't know anybody here. The charity director took the stage. Tonight we honor someone special. In eight months, she

There's this guy in my neighborhood who started stealing my packages about two months ago. At first I thought it was just bad luck when my new headphones went missing. Then my coffee maker disappeared, then a birthday gift for my mom. After the fourth theft, I started tracking delivery times, obsessively trying to grab packages the second they arrived. But this guy was watching, too. I'd check the delivery notification rush outside, five minutes later, and the package would already be gone. I saw him once. He was in his mid 30s, baseball cap, driving a beat up Toyota Corolla that he'd park one street over before walking to my house. He wasn't even subtle about it. He'd stroll up my driveway in broad daylight like he owned the place. I put up a no trespassing sign. He took that, too. I added a mile you're on camera sign even though I didn't have cameras yet. The next day, that sign was in my recycling bin. That's when things got personal. He started leaving sticky notes on my door after stealing packages. The first one said, thanks for the Bluetooth speaker, sucker, with a smiley face drawn on it. The next time, after taking my workout supplements, he left a note saying, maybe try working out your brain instead. He was taunting me when he stole my girlfriend's anniversary gift. He actually had the nerve to leave a note saying she's too good for someone who can't even protect a package. Nice choice on the earrings though. That one made my blood boil. I tried everything having packages delivered to my work, but my boss shut that down. Amazon lockers were always full. I asked neighbors to grab them, but they work during the day too. The worst part was when he stole my diabetic cat special food delivery and left a note thanks for the feast, dummy. My cat had to go without his prescription food for 3 days while I waited for a replacement. I was literally trapped. I couldn't order anything to my own home. This guy was controlling my life and he was enjoying every second of it. I finally hit my limit when he stole my grandmother's medication that I'd ordered for her. The note said Hope Granny's not in a rush. Lol that was it. I went to the police station with all the sticky notes as evidence. The officer took my report, said they'd investigate, and told me package theft was unfortunately common. They'd increase patrol, they said. They'd keep an eye out, they said. But we both knew nothing would happen. It was just petty theft to them, a property crime that wasn't worth their resources. I went home furious and started researching my options online. My first thought was a glitter bomb or dye pack, but then I found forums discussing Package protect. Turns out booby trapping packages is illegal. You can actually get sued or arrested for injuring a thief. Even a harmless glitter bomb could technically be considered assault. I was about to give up when I stumbled across a post from a lawyer explaining that tampering with federal mail is a serious federal crime, not just petty theft. Federal mail includes anything sent through USPS with proper postage. The penalties were severe, up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. That's when my plan started forming. I invested in a high quality security camera system with clear night vision and motion detection, spending nearly $500 I couldn't really afford. I made sure one camera had a perfect angle of my driveway where cars would pass. Then I prepared my trap. I ordered a cheap item from eBay, but specifically requested USPS Priority Mail shipping. When it arrived, I carefully opened it from the bottom, keeping the federal mail label intact and visible. I

Macy was 13 when she started sacrificing her own life to save her little sisters. Zada had a plastic anemia, meaning she needed extra blood, bone marrow, even organs. By 16, Macy had donated over 500 pints of blood, had corkscrews drilled into her for bone marrow six times, even gave Zeta a kidney and six 2% of her liver. At 18, she was down to 87 pounds, taking 23 pills a day to keep her remaining organs functioning. Her dream of motherhood was dead. Her immune system was destroyed, and her bones fractured upon the slightest impact. But Zada was alive, thriving, and living the teenage life may see gave up. Two years later, Macy got diagnosed with lymphoma. Doctors said it was likely the extreme stress she put her body through. And yet Macy didn't cry or didn't complain. All she asked for there was one thing. When cancer patients finish their last treatment, they ring this brass bell in the main lobby. Three rings to say you survived. Macy had watched dozens of people ring it. Their families would cry and cheer. She wanted that for once. She wanted to be the one being celebrated for surviving. She texted the family group chat, June 15th, they let me ring the remission bell. Would mean the world if you could be there. Zada instantly responded with heart emojis. The whole family promised they'd be there the morning of June 15th. Macy did her makeup for the first time in two years and even styled what was left of her hair. During her final treatment, nurses kept asking how she was feeling. Amazing. My family is coming, she kept saying. They're all coming to see me ring the bell. At 2:45, Macy was sitting in the lobby watching the main entrance, her hands shaking from excitement. But at three PM, there was nobody there. The bell coordinator asked if she was ready. Just one more minute, Macy said. They're probably just parking. At 3:05, Macy texted the group, hey, I'm at the bell waiting for you. Zada read it but gave no response. Macy called her and got nothing. She called mom and got the same, but her dad answered, hey, sweetie, what's up? Zada was laughing in the background. Dad, I'm at the hospital. The bell ceremony. There was a pause. Oh, crap, honey, that's today. We threw Zada a college acceptance party. She got into Berkeley, full ride. Macy's legs gave out. She sat down hard on the lobby bench. Zada's party. Her voice was tiny. Yeah, it was a surprise thing. She wanted to celebrate getting into pre med. You know, following in your footsteps. Helping people like you helped her. Then Zeta shouted into the phone, is that Macy? Tell her we'll celebrate with her later. Dad, Macy whispered, I'm at my last cancer treatment. The bell ceremony. I texted everyone. You all said you'd come. Oh, Honey, you know how bad I am with texts. Look, ring the bell and have someone video it. We'll watch it later. He hung up. The lobby was now full of other patients and families, all watching this girl in a yellow dress sitting alone. Macy stood up slowly and walked to the bell. She was supposed to ring it three times, but she rang it once. A few people clapped awkwardly, and that's when the tears started coming. Pamela, the head nurse, who'd been with Macy every step of the way, ran over and pulled her into a hug. I gave her everything. I gave her my body. Macy cried. I can't have kids because of it. I gave her everything, and she couldn't give me 10 minutes. The next Sunday was their regular family dinner. Macy almost didn't go, but habit is hard to break. She walked in, and everyone was still talking about Zada's Berkeley acceptance. Nobody mentioned the bell. Nobody asked about her final treatment. Nobody even said congratulations. Halfway through dinner, mom casually said, oh, Macy, did you do your little belt

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the center of attention for 5 minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance, Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day, the one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding, I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up, he said. And I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself and I just can't deal with that stress on my wedding day. The line went quiet for like 10 seconds and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now you're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. She's basically family. I tried To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice. Hope think he changed his mind? He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, he says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted like 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewelry. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today with a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. He's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done and I have to deal with this. So I march outside in my robe and slippers, my hair still in curlers. Jake sees me coming and his face goes red. Before you say anything. No, I cut him off. Absolutely not. I told you three months ago she couldn't come. You said you wouldn't come. Now you're both here. Becca steps out from behind Jake wearing this bright red dress that looks exactly like something a bride. Would wear to her own reception. I'm not even kidding. It had sparkles and everything. I just wanted to support you on your special day, she says in this fake sweet voice. I brought you a gift and everything. Get out. I said, both of you right now. Jake starts yelling about how I'm being a bridezilla and how Becca just wants to be supportive. Meanwhile, Becca is taking selfies in front of the wedding decorations. That's when my dad steps in. He grabs Jake by the arm and says, you made your choice three months ago. You can make it again right now. Either she leaves and you stay or you both leave. Jake looks at me, then at Becca, then back at me. I'm literally holding my breath. He chooses Becca. They both storm off, but not before Becca posts another Instagram story about how some people are just too selfish to share their happiness while filming our wedding venue in the background. The wedding went perfectly after that. No drama, no attention seeking, no weird announcements during the toasts. Ryan and I had our first dance without worrying about someone trying to cut in or make a scene. But the real kicker, two weeks after our wedding, Jake calls me crying. Turns out Becca had been cheating on him with his roommate for like six months. She only wanted to come to the wedding because she knew his whole family would be there and she could play The perfect girlfriend. One last time before she dumped him.

So I'm 24, and I've been vegan for, like, 10 years now. Ever since I was a little kid and found out where meat comes from. I just couldn't do it anymore. Everyone in my life knows this. My family, friends, co workers, literally everyone. Four nights ago, I was at this party at my friend Jake's place. I'll be honest. I got absolutely wasted. Like, embarrassingly drunk. My friends were all laughing and having a good time, and I was just trying to keep up with everyone else. Around midnight, I got super hungry. You know how it is when you're drunk. My friend Caitlin comes up to me with this made of chicken nuggets, and I'm like, oh, these look good. Are they vegan? She goes, yeah, totally. They're those Sunfed ones from the store. I knew Sunfed made pretty good fake chicken stuff, so I trusted her. I grabbed, like, six nuggets and started eating them. It tasted kind of weird, but I figured it was just because I was drunk and my taste buds were off. Plus, the lighting was dim, and I couldn't really see them that well. I finished the whole plate and didn't think anything of it. The next morning, I woke up with the worst hangover ever. My head was pounding and I felt sick to my stomach. But then around noon, my sister Emma text me saying, you need to check Jake's Snapchat. Story right now. I had this sinking feeling in my gut. I opened Snapchat and there it was. The first video showed Caitlin holding up a package of actual chicken nuggets. Like, real Tyson chicken nuggets from the freezer section. Then the next video was me asking if they were vegan and her saying yes. Then there's this clip of me eating them and being all happy and drunk. But the worst part was the last few videos after I left the party, they filmed themselves pretending to be when I would find out. Caitlin was fake crying and screaming, oh no, the poor chickens! In this mocking voice. Jake was pretending to throw up and going, I can't believe I ate a real animal! They were all laughing hysterically. I screen recorded everything before they could delete it. I was shaking, I was so angry. This wasn't just some harmless joke. They knew how important being vegan was to me. They knew I hadn't eaten meat in over 10 years, and they filmed themselves mocking something that was genuinely important to me. I called my sister first and she was furious. She told me I should definitely do something about it. Then I called my mom and she said the same thing. They both said this went way beyond a normal prank. I spent like two hours researching online and found out that deliberately giving someone food they can't or won't eat can actually be considered food tampering. Especially When it's done without their knowledge and filmed for humiliation purposes. So I drove to the police station with all the video evidence. The officer I talked to was actually really understanding. He said they'd seen cases like this before, especially with people who have food allergies or dietary restrictions for religious reasons. He took my statement and all the evidence within three days. Caitlin, Jake, and another friend named Austin, who was also involved, got served with charges. Food tampering is apparently a misdemeanor, but it can still go on your record and everything. My lawyer friend told me I actually have a pretty strong case. Food tampering is taken seriously, especially when there's video evidence. And it was done specifically to cause distress. Plus the public humiliation aspect makes it even worse. The court date is next month, and honestly, I'm not sure what's going to happen.

There's this guy in my neighborhood who started stealing my packages about two months ago. At first I thought it was just bad luck when my new headphones went missing. Then my coffee maker disappeared, then a birthday gift for my mom. After the fourth theft, I started tracking delivery times, obsessively trying grab packages the second they arrived. But this guy was watching, too. I checked the delivery notification rush outside five minutes later, and the package would already be gone. I saw him once. He was in his mid 30s, baseball cap, driving a beat up Toyota Corolla that he'd park one street over before walking to my house. He wasn't even subtle about it. He'd stroll up my driveway in broad daylight like he owned the place. I put up a no trespassing sign. He took that, too. I added a while you're on camera sign even though I didn't have cameras yet. The next day, that sign was in my recycling bin. That's when things got personal. He started leaving sticky notes on my door after stealing packages. The first one said, thanks for the Bluetooth speaker, sucker, with a smiley face drawn on it. The next time, after taking my workout supplements, he left a note saying, maybe try working out your brain instead. He was taunting me when he stole my girlfriend's anniversary gift. He Actually had the nerve to leave a note saying she's too good for someone who can't even protect a package. Nice choice on the earrings though. That one made my blood boil. I tried everything having packages delivered to my work, but my boss shut that down. Amazon lockers were always full. I asked neighbors to grab them but they were during the day too. The worst part was when he stole my diabetic cat special food delivery and left a note thanks for the feast, dummy. My cat had to go without his prescription food for three days while I waited for a replacement. I was literally trapped. I. I couldn't order anything to my own home. This guy was controlling my life and he was enjoying every second of it. I finally hit my limit when he stole my grandmother's medication that I'd ordered for her. The note said Hope Granny's not in a rush. Lol. That was it. I went to the police station with all the sticky notes as evidence. The officer took my report, said they'd investigate, and told me package theft was unfortunately common. They'd increased, but trolls they said. They'd keep an eye out, they said, but we both knew nothing would happen. It was just petty theft to them, a property crime that wasn't worth their resources. I went home furious and started researching my options online. My first thought was a glitter bomb or dye pack, but then I found forums. Discussing package protect. Turns out booby trapping packages is illegal. You can actually get sued or arrested for injuring a thief. Even a harmless glitter bomb could technically be considered assault. I was about to give up when I stumbled across a post from a lawyer explaining that tampering with federal mail is a serious federal crime, not just petty theft. Federal mail includes anything sent through USPS with proper postage. Penalties were severe, up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. That's when my plan started forming. I invested in a high quality security camera system with clear night vision and motion detection, spending nearly $500 I couldn't really afford. I made sure one camera had a perfect angle of my driveway where cars would pass, and I prepared my trap. I ordered a cheap item from eBay, but specifically requested USPS Priority Mail shipping. When it arrived, I carefully opened it from the bottom, keeping the federal mail label intact and visible. I placed the original item inside a larger Amazon box and put that Amazon.

So I gave him the 1950s housewife he wanted. I had been with Craig for three years when he completely ruined my promotion dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. Women today are the problem with everything, he said, twirling his pasta. They don't know how to be real women anymore. They're always trying to wear the pants, competing with men instead of serving them. My grandpa had it right. His woman stayed home, cooked his meals, and didn't talk back. My wine glass stopped halfway to my mouth. Craig, we are literally here to celebrate my promotion. That's exactly what I mean. You care more about your stupid job than making me happy. Back in the day, women knew their place and kept their man satisfied. I looked around the restaurant where we were supposed to be celebrating my success. So you want a traditional relationship, like the actual 1950s? His eyes lit up. Finally you get it. Yes. A real woman who acts like a woman should, the way god intended. Okay, traditional it is. He reached over to grab my hand. See, I knew you would understand. Most women would get all feminist and defensive about this. The next morning, I showed up to breakfast in a full 1950s housewife outfit, complete with pearls and a puffy dress that covered my ankles. Good morning, Mr. Anderson, I said, putting his coffee down. He laughed. Okay, the outfit is cute. But you don't have to call me that. Oh, but I do. In the 1950s, a proper lady always addresses her man respectfully. His smile started to fade that evening when he wanted to go to his friend's party. I shook my head. Oh, no, Mr. Anderson. I can't share a car with you. We're not married. People would think I'm a prostitute. What? That's insane. In the 1950s, unmarried couples needed chaperones. I will have to take the bus and meet you there. The bus? Just get in the car. That would make me a loose woman, Mister Anderson. He had to explain to everyone at the party why we arrived separately. At the party, his friend Kyle asked about my promotion. I turned to Craig. May I answer him, Mister Anderson? Craig's face went red. Just talk to him. As you wish. I turned to Kyle. Mr. Anderson doesn't believe women should work. I will be quitting my job soon to focus on cooking and cleaning like a real woman. My mother failed to teach me that my only value is serving a man. Kyle nearly choked on his beer. Dude, what the hell? She's being stupid. Craig muttered. No, Mr. Anderson believes modern women are broken. I think we deserve Equality when we should be grateful men even put up with us. I sat quietly, hands folded, only speaking when Craig gave permission. His friends kept staring at him. The real entertainment started at his company picnic. When his boss's wife asked about my job, I smiled sweetly. Mr. Anderson says careers make women forget how to be women. Would you like my potato salad recipe instead? The only thing I'm good for. I spent the entire event walking three steps behind Craig, staring at the ground, calling him Mr. Anderson, and asking his permission for everything. May I have a hot dog, Mr. Anderson? Just take the damn hot dog. Is that a yes? I need you to say yes or no. His co workers started whispering. When someone asked why I kept calling him Mr. Anderson, I explained happily. Craig says modern women destroyed society by thinking they're equal to men. He wanted a traditional 1950s relationship where I knew my place. His boss overheard Craig, did you really say that? She's twisting my words. Craig growled, oh, no. Mr. Anderson was very clear. He said women and should shut up, stay home, and give men sex on demand. The boss's face went ice cold. HR will want to discuss this on Monday, Craig. By week three, Craig was cracking. Can we please have sex? He asked one night. I gasped, clutching my pearls. Literally, Mr. Anderson, good girls don't do that before marriage. What would? Jesus

Cassidy dumped me for my best friend Braden at prom entrance. And it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. What she didn't know was that I'd already spent $400 on matching burgundy outfits she begged for. Can't January. I've been working doubles at a pizza joint every weekend. Had her dad's blessing to ask her to be my prom queen. Even practice my speech in the car during lunch breaks like an idiot. But when I showed up at her house that Friday night in the burgundy tux corsage shaking in my hands, her mom's face told me everything. Honey, she already left with Braden. I sat on the porch with my head in my heads when I realized what was happening. But I drove to the venue anyway, thinking maybe her mom was confused. Nope. I found them at the entrance. Cassidy wearing the burgundy dress I'd bought, but with his cheap gold corsage on her wrist. She looked at me with zero emotion. Braden and I have been together for months. You were too busy with college applications to notice. Then my best friend, the guy who'd help me pick her corsage that morning, actually said, thanks for keeping her warm, bro. I handed my sixty dollar corsage to some terrified freshman girl standing nearby and walked into prom alone. The whole time I Kept thinking about that Stanford scholarship. I've been planning to decline to stay near her. Maybe I didn't have to anymore. As soon as I walked in, something strange happened. People started surrounding me. Not with pity, but actual anger at them. My younger sister dragged me to the dance floor. Everyone saw what they did. Everyone thinks they're trash. Then I saw Cassidy standing by the punch bowl by herself, pretending to text. Someone grabbed my hand right then. It was Brandon's ex. He's outside with someone else right now. He's been playing Cassidy since day one, just like he did with me. We danced a bit while Cassidy watched from across the room, her face getting redder with each song. Things got crazy, though. When they announced prom court and the DJ actually called my name for king. The entire gym went bonkers. Cassidy didn't even make court, despite campaigning for months with homemade cookies and promises. She tried to hug me during the crowning, but I walked past her to dance with the Queen. Things were only going to get better, though. Everyone went to a huge after party, where I met this cute girl from another high school. I couldn't believe that she was also heading to Stanford for pre med. She also couldn't stop laughing at my story about getting dumped at the door, which made me like her more, to be honest. We talked until sunrise about everything except Cassidy. Meanwhile, Braden had returned. From wherever he was. And Cassidy left crying when she saw lipstick on his collar. Her best friend told me later that she been posting and deleting messages all night, trying to make it look like she was having fun. Three weeks later, my phone wouldn't stop buzzing. At two in the morning, 27 messages from Cassidy. Went to his house, and another girl answered the door. He's been with three other people this whole time. You were the only real thing I had. The funny thing was, Cassidy thought she was upgrading when she picked Braden. Instead, she freed me to take that scholarship, meet someone who actually wanted the same future, and build a life she never would have let me have.

My sister died when my niece Chloe was 12 and her dad basically disappeared after that. So Chloe moved in with me and my husband. He was this quiet kid who barely talked for the first year, which honestly broke my heart because my sister was the loudest person alive. By the time Chloe turned 15, she started opening up more. She tell me about school, drama, boys she thought were cute, normal teenage stuff. But then junior year, she started acting different. She get weird when her friends talked about guys and she stopped mentioning crushes all together. I figured she was just focusing on school. One night she was helping me make dinner when she goes, Aunt Jamie, what would you do if someone in our family was gay? I'm stirring pasta sauce trying to act casual and I said something like, love them the exact same way I always have. She got quiet after that. A few weeks later, she brought home this girl named Alex for a study session, except they weren't studying anything. They we're sitting way too close on the couch sharing earbuds and Chloe was laughing more than I'd seen in years. When Alex left, Chloe had this dopey smile that gave everything away. I didn't say anything because I wanted her to tell me when she was ready. But then my mom called last month asking if Chloe Was dating anyone. My mom's old school Catholic, the type who still thinks being gay is a choice and that prayer can fix everything. She started going on about how she couldn't wait for Chloe to find a nice boy and settle down. That's when I realized the problem. See, my sister left Chloe a pretty big inheritance that she gets when she turns 18. But there's a catch. My mom controls it until then. And knowing my mom, if she found out Chloe was gay, she'd probably find some way to mess with that money or make Chloe's life hell. So when Chloe finally came out to me last week, I was in my kitchen at midnight, scared I'd kick her out. I hugged her tight and told her I was proud of her. But then I said, listen, you need to keep this between us for now. Your grandma can't know until you get your inheritance. She looked confused. So I explained the whole situation, how grandma still thinks gay people are going to hell, how she controls the money, how we only have to wait six more months until Chloe turns 18. Chloe got upset and said she was tired of hiding who she was. I, I told her I wasn't asking her to hide forever, just to be smart about it. Bring Alex over whenever you want, I said. Be yourselves here, but around grandma maybe. Don't mention the girlfriend part yet. She called me a Coward and locked herself in her room for two days. My husband thinks I'm wrong, too, says we shouldn't let my mom's bigotry control our choices. I've seen how nasty my mom can get when she disapproves of something. I cut off my cousin for getting pregnant at 19 and didn't speak to him for three years. Six months feels like forever when you're 17 and in love. But that inheritance could pay for Chloe's college, maybe help her buy a house someday. It's her mom's money, money my sister saved specifically for Chloe's future.

And now he's crying to me because all our major clients followed me out the door. Ricardo strutted into my annual review 30 minutes late, laughing on the phone about firing someone who'd asked for maternity leave. He hung up, looked at me like I was dirt on his shoe, and said he had 10 minutes before his massage appointment. I'd save this company from bankruptcy three times, built our entire client base from nothing. And he once introduced me at a conference as the help. But I personally convinced major corporations to trust us. I started explaining why I deserved a raise after 10 years, and he looked at me like I was the biggest moron in the room. You want 30% more for what? Answering emails and phone calls? He laughed like I told a joke. Look at this. He spun his laptop around, showing me a job posting, my exact position, offering half my salary. I could hire two college kids to do your job. How? I could train my assistant to do what you do in a week. Ricardo, those three big accounts only work with us because. Because we're cheap and convenient, not because you're some irreplaceable genius. He stood up, walking to his window that overlooked the parking lot. You know what your problem is? You think you matter. You think these clients care about you. They don't. They care about rates and delivery times. You're just the voice on the phone. Replaceable. That word hung in the air like a slap. The phone rang, interrupting the moments. Ricardo's assistant knocked and entered, looking nervous. Sorry, but Mister Tanaka from our biggest client is online. One? He's asking for her specifically. She nodded toward me. Ricardo's face went red. Transfer him to me. I'm the CEO here. I tried. He said he only deals with her. Ricardo grabbed the phone, punching buttons. Aggressive. Mister Tanaka? This is Ricardo, the CEO. What can I do for you? His face changed as he listened. Without a word, he handed me the phone. Turns out they had a shipping crisis, which I fixed in five minutes. Something Ricardo couldn't have understood if I'd explained it for hours. When I hung up, he was furious. See? Simple problem. Anyone who knows our system could have fixed that. You're not special. You're not irreplaceable. You're convenient. That's it. So no raise, then? No raise. In fact, you should be grateful I don't cut your pay to match what I could hire someone else for. You want my advice? Shut up and do your job. Or test how replaceable you really are. I spent the weekend making phone calls. First to Mister Tanaka, then to our second biggest client, then our third. Three conversations, three confirmations. They didn't do business with the company. They did business with me. By Sunday night, I had three job offers from competitors and more importantly, three clients. Ready? Follow me. Monday morning, I walked into Ricardo's office and handed him my resignation, effective immediately. He actually smiled as he read it. Running to a competitor. Good luck starting from zero. You'll be begging for this job in a month. He was already pulling up recruiting websites. I'll have someone in your chair by Friday, probably.

My mother in law, Gloria, spent last Christmas going through every single gift bag at my house like a crazy person. She was getting more and more frantic with each bag she checked. Gloria had been giving me the worst gifts for years. Last year on my birthday, she handed me this old candle that said happy 50th on it. When I was only 32, the price tag from some garage sale was still stuck on it, showing 75 cents. And for Christmas, she gave me a cookbook called cooking for one. Even though I've been married to her son for five years. Inside, someone named Janet had written good luck, Janet in pen. When I tried bringing it up, she just laughed. Often say the thought is what counts. But when her birthday rolled around, she expected the exact perfume she wanted and specific jewelry she'd been eyeing. She literally cried once because her gift came in a regular box instead of a fancy gift bag. My husband stood there watching me wrap Gloria's Christmas present in wrinkled paper from last year. Inside was the foot spa she gave me last month with a thrift store sticker still on it for $12 on Christmas morning. Gloria unwrapped it and her face went pale. This looks familiar, she said slowly. Found it at a cute little shop, I told her. Two months later, for her birthday, I gave Her. That cooking for one cookbook with a sticky note over Janet's message. She opened it in front of her whole book club and the room went silent. I knew something was off, but couldn't figure out what. Mother's Day came and she was nervous opening my gift. It was the happy 50th candle with the 75 cent tag. I'm 67, she said. It's decorative. Age is just a number for her anniversary. She actually shook the box before opening it. Inside was a singing fish from their garage that she'd given my husband three years ago. The batteries were dead. This time she stared at me for a full 10 seconds before forcing a thank you. By summer, Gloria was losing it. She'd started keeping a notebook, writing down what she gave people. At her sister's birthday party, she unwrapped the purse with a broken zipper and immediately looked at me. I just smiled. Thanksgiving came and she refused to open my gift in front of anyone. But her husband grabbed it and opened it for her. Wine glasses with dolphins. These were in our donation box, said Gloria. Grabbed his arm hard. No, they weren't, she said quickly. But now he was suspicious, too. At my birthday in November, Gloria gave me an envelope with cash. Thought this would be easier, she said, watching me carefully. I thanked her warmly. She looked relieved. Then Christmas decorations started going up and Gloria got tense again. Our family Christmas party. Was packed with relatives. Gloria kept her gift from me in her lap, not opening it. Her sister Barbara kept asking her to open it so everyone could see. Finally Gloria gave in and started unwrapping it slowly. Inside was a crystal vase with a massive crack down the side. Gloria went still. Barbara leaned over to look at it. The whole room was watching. Now wait, Barbara said, picking it up. Gloria, isn't this grandma's vase? The one you dropped at Easter Five years ago? My father in law stood up to look closer. You told

My dad said, we didn't think you'd wanna come since you barely finished school yourself. I just smiled and said, then don't worry about my ceremony next month. Two weeks later, my cousin posted a selfie standing under a banner with my face on it. That's when the call started. The banner read, Congratulations, Doctor Emma Mitchell, Suma Kumlaude. My phone exploded with notifications from family members who'd written me off years ago. See, my family always saw me as the failure. My brother Jake was the golden child. Straight A's, debate Captain, perfect everything. I had undiagnosed ADHD and struggle with C's and D's. Every dinner became an interrogation about my latest disappointment. Why can't you just apply yourself like Jake? My mom would ask, while my dad shook his head in silent judgment. Jake would sit there looking uncomfortable, but never defended me. The constant comparisons crushed my spirit until I stopped trying altogether. When I graduated high school, barely passing, they threw Jake a lavish party with extended family, friends and my parents colleagues for me. Hence dinner and a community college pamphlet. We have to be realistic about your capabilities, Emma, my dad said, sliding the brochure across the table like a consolation prize. I moved out the next day with just my Honda Civic and whatever fit in the trunk. My parents seemed almost relieved to see me go. Jake called once to ask Where I was staying, but the conversation was brief and awkward. I found a tiny studio apartment and took a job as a receptionist at a medical clinic to pay the bills. I visited for holidays, and during the pitying looks and pointed questions about when I would get serious about my future, they'd update me on Jake's achievements, his internships, his academic awards, his acceptance to prestigious MBA programs. I just nod and smile. What they didn't know was that working at the clinic had sparked something in me. I found the medical field fascinating, and several doctors noticed my natural aptitude for understanding complex aces. 1 physician, Doctor Ramirez took me under her wing. She recognized my ADHD symptoms immediately and helped me get properly diagnosed and treated. You have a brilliant mind, Emma, she told me. You just needed the right tools to access it. With her encouragement, I enrolled in night classes at the community college. For the first time in my life, I experience experienced academic success. My grades were stellar. I discovered that with proper support for my ADHD, I didn't just learn, I excelled. I transferred to a four year university, completed my undergraduate degree with honors, and was accepted to medical school. Throughout this journey, I maintained minimal contact with my family. Holiday visits became phone calls, then just text messages. They never asked about my education, assuming I was still working as a receptionist. A few times I tried mentioning my Classes. But my father would change the subject, and my mother would look uncomfortable. Jake was too busy with his own success to notice mine. Only Megan, my cousin on my mother's side, knew the truth. She always been kind to me, and when I told her about medical school, she became my biggest cheerleader. She attended every milestone. My white coat ceremony, my clinical rotations, my research present tentations. The day before Jake's NBA graduation dinner, I called my parents one last time. Are you sure there's no room for me tomorrow? I asked. Emma, we've been through this. My dad said it's for people who've actually accomplished something academically. That's when I knew I was done hiding. At my medical school graduation, Megan sat in the front row beaming

My best friend Claire was dying and needed me to make her a promise that would destroy my marriage. We were sitting in the hospice room while her three kids colored in the hallway when she grabbed my hand and asked me to adopt them after she was gone. Her boys were 11 and 9, and her daughter had just turned 7. Their dad had overdosed two years earlier, and with Claire's parents dead and her sister in Germany, there was nobody else. I wanted to say yes immediately, my husband had already told me that if I even considered taking them, we were done. Our son Caleb, was 12 and severely autistic, requiring constant supervision that consumed our entire lives. My husband worked nights so I could work days, and we tagged each other like wrestlers because Caleb couldn't be left alone for five minutes without potentially hurting himself. We hadn't been on a date in three years or had a conversation that wasn't about therapy, schedules, or medications. Adding three traumatized kids would push us past our breaking point, and he had made it clear he would leave before letting that happen. But Claire was the only person who showed up when Caleb was diagnosed while everyone else disappeared. She brought groceries when I couldn't leave the house and watched him during meltdowns so I could shower, and never acted like we were A. The social worker visited the day after Claire died, and the visit went exactly as I expected. Caleb had a meltdown when she arrived and spent 40 minutes hitting himself while I tried to calm him down. My husband stood in the corner with arms crossed while the social worker took notes and asked how we would manage three additional children when we were clearly overwhelmed. He laughed out loud at that question and walked out, slamming the door so hard the picture frames rattled. The kids were in emergency foster placement for 72 hours, then would be separated into different homes unless family stepped forward to take them. The oldest had started wetting the bed and refusing to eat, while the middle boy wouldn't speak and just sat humming and rocking. The little girl kept asking when Mommy was coming back from heaven. My husband found me crying in Caleb's room and delivered the ultimatum I had been dreading since Claire asked for my promise. If you do this, I'm filing for divorce and seeking primary custody of Caleb because you're being irresponsible with his care. The words came out flat and mechanical, the way he processed anything too heavy to feel. Part of me understood, because Caleb would suffer if we tried integrating three grieving children into our controlled routine. But the oldest had memorized every Pokemon and could talk about them for hours, which would connect with Caleb's identical obsession. The middle child moved like a Ghost and wouldn't disturb Caleb's need for predictability, while the little girl understood different meant special because Claire had taught her that these weren't random foster kids. The children who knew our house and called me Auntie, with nobody else who even knew their middle names. The foster family called that night because the little girl wouldn't stop screaming, and the oldest had tried running away twice looking for my house. The little girl's wailing came through the phone, begging for her mommy or me or anyone who smelled familiar. While the foster mother asked if I could fix this over the phone. My husband watched from the doorway as I lied that everything would work out when we both knew the system would swallow them whole. You can't save everyone, he said after I hung up. But the

Growing up, Kenzie never let me forget my place in our friendship. Every party, every hangout, every introduction came with the same unspoken rule. I was the designated ugly fat friend who made her shine brighter. This is my friend who's really funny, she'd say, which everyone knew meant not pretty. It hurt every single time. Kenzie was gorgeous, I knew that. But her constant reminders made me believe I was worthless. Was I really that hideous? When I was 22, something shifted. I needed a physical outlet for my anxiety and found a groupon for a rock climbing gym across town. The first day, my hands shook on every hold. But something about solving each route, finding my path up the wall, made me feel powerful. That's when I discovered my escape. I started climbing four nights a week in secret. My hands bled, then calloused. Ice my forearms after every session. Watch technique videos until 2:00am, practice grip strength exercises at my desk. Wednesday and Friday nights, I climbed with the regulars, including this guy, Sebastian, who became my climbing partner. We spot each other, celebrate sends, build genuine friendship through shared challenges. I never mentioned him to Kenzie. She wouldn't care about my gym friends anyway. Meanwhile, Kenzie had become obsessed with her marketing firm crush. She constantly prove I was the ugly friend by making me stand Next to her in mirrors. See the difference? She'd say, adjusting her hair. Some people just have it. Others are good listeners. She'd drag me shopping, hold up identical outfits against us both. This would look cute on me. You should stick to black. It's slimming. What killed me was how she document everything on Instagram, always cropping me out or positioning me behind her natural beauty. She option photos where I was literally holding her phone's ring light. I started wondering if she was right. Maybe I was fooling myself, thinking climbing made me worth something. Kenzie's birthday party was approaching. This rooftop bar event she'd been planning for months. She'd invited her entire office, especially her crush. He finally rsvp'd. Yes! She squealed. I need you there. don't talk too much. Just laugh at my jokes and leave early if I give you the signal. The night of the party, she made me wear this shapeless black dress. It's so you. She lied. As guests arrived, she positioned me strategically. Visible enough to make her look charitable for having an ugly friend, hidden enough not to distract. Then her crush walked in with three friends. Kenzie grab my arm, whispered, remember your wallpaper. But when he scanned the crowd, his eyes stopped on me. His whole face lit up. Oh, my god, red! He called out, using my climbing nickname. Kenzie froze. Sebastian practically ran over his friends, trailing behind. Guys, this is the girl I've Been telling you about the one who sent that impossible 5 11 route last week? He turned to me, eyes bright with genuine excitement. I can't believe you're here. Wait. You know, Kenzie, for the next hour, Sebastian couldn't stop talking about our climbing adventures. He told everyone about the time I helped him overcome his fear of overhangs, how I taught him this specific heel hook technique, how watching me climb had made him a better athlete. His friends already knew stories.

I found out why at our wedding. I'm getting ready in the bridal suite, and my bridesmaids just left for coffee. Finally alone for a minute. Here's what you need to know about the man I'm about to marry. I moved across the country for him. California to Maine. Do you know how cold Maine is? But the way he looked at me at the airport that first day, holding that stupid handmade sign that said, my California sunshine made every frozen morning worth it. I nursed his mother through chemo last year. Held the okay while she threw up at 3:00am. Cleaned it, held her hand. She grabbed my face once between treatments and whispered, you saved my son. That's when I knew we were real family. When he lost his job, he went through the darkest six months. Some days, I'd have to guide him to the shower, help him remember to eat. He'd play call of duty until 4:00am because he said it was the only thing that kept the anxiety quiet. But watching him fight through it, watching him slowly come back to life, that's real love. When he finally got better, he proposed by hiding the ring in my first edition Harry Potter, the one my grandmother left me. He was so nervous, he accidentally cut too deep and destroyed the binding. He literally cry. I'd when he realized what he'd done. Still checks every antique bookstore. We passed, determined to find a replacement. That's my future husband. He messes up, but never stops trying to fix it. Now, I knew we couldn't afford a very lavish wedding, but the main thing I wanted was for my wedding dress to have pockets. I know, silly, but I needed something to hold on to when I get nervous. Something that's just mine. Searched everywhere for months. Finally found this ivory silk dress with hidden pockets so deep I could bury my whole hands. Don't care about lace or beating or whatever. Just wanted those pockets. My mom says I'm weird, but my fiance gets it. He always gets me. The ceremony is beautiful. He actually cries when he sees me. His mother, cancer free now, mouths thank you, and I almost lose it. The photographer whispers, we're the most in love couple she's ever shot. Everyone's crying happy tears. My dad actually smiles for the first time since mom died. We wrote our own vows. He looks me in the eyes and promises to always be honest and never keep secrets, as he can't wait to start a family when the time is right. I believe him. Every single word. Reception starts, and his coworker shows up late looking green. Like, actually green. She keeps staring at me during dinner. With his face. It's like. Like she's at a funeral. I saw her try to approach me twice, but my husband intercepts. She's drunk, he says. But I'm Watching her. She's drinking water during our cake cutting. She's sobbing in the corner. Not pretty tears. Ugly crying. My hands find my pockets. That nervous thing I do when I noticed there's paper. Thick paper. I excuse myself to the bathroom, and the coworker follows me, mascara streaming down her face. I'm so sorry. I tried to tell you before. My heart's pounding. Tell me what? He's gasping between sobs. Check your pocket. I paid your Taylor to put it there. You deserve to know. Then she bolts. I can't breathe. My hands shake as I pull out the paper. It's a sonogram. Three months old. On the back and purple pen. I'm keeping it. You deserve to know.

Then her friend told me, I'd make you mine tonight. She panicked for months. My situationship cried about how much she needed me for her birthday. I spent all morning decorating her place while she was at the spa I paid for. When she walked through the door and everyone yelled, surprise! She's squealed and hugged every single person except me. Oh, my god, you guys are the best! She gushed, talking to everyone while I stood there holding the custom cake I'd ordered three weeks go. She literally walked around me like I was furniture. She ignored me while I tried to wish her a happy birthday. When her cousin asked, who's that guy by the cake? She actually said, oh, that's just Harry. He helped out a bit. Helped out? I'd literally coordinated every single person in this room and paid for everything. You must be the famous Harry. Set a voice beside me as I set the cake down, I learn to find her best friend, Ariel, who I'd heard about constantly but never met. She was visiting from Seattle for the party. Brunette with kind eyes. Famous might be a stretch, I said, watching her take selfies with everyone while I became invisible in her living room. Ariel followed my gaze. She always does this, doesn't she? Keeps people at arms length while making them think they're close. She picked up a champagne glass. I've watched her do It since college. You seem different, though. Let me guess, Ariel continued, studying me. You met on Tinder. She said she wanted something real. The first date was perfect, right? Told you she could see something special with you. I stared at her, stunned. How did you? Because that's her script, Ariel said simply. Same one she used on the last three guys. Did she cry about her ex ruining her ability to trust? Ariel's words hit something deep. Eight months of I need more time to figure out what I want. Eight months of being introduced as just my name. Eight months of watching her keep her options open while I closed mine completely. Last month, when I brought not being exclusive again, she cried. Said I was pressuring her, that she thought we were perfect how we were. I'd apologized. Apologized for wanting to be her boyfriend officially. You decorated this whole place, didn't you? Ariel said, looking at the rose gold theme. I spent hours perfecting because I knew it was her favorite. Her friends told me you coordinated everything. Even drove to three different stores to find those specific balloons. Nodded, watching her show some guy her tinder matches while laughing with her cousin. She deleted tinder, right? Ariel asked. Of course not, I said. She needs it for networking. You know what's crazy? Ariel continued. In all our calls, she's never once called you her boyfriend. But she loses it when you don't text back. Fast enough. The truth of it stung. Just last week, she'd shown up at my apartment at 2:00am, crying because I'd fallen asleep and missed her calls, convinced I was with someone else. Ariel moved closer, her voice dropping. I came here to visit her, but really, I wanted to meet you. She talks about you constantly, but only when she's worried you might leave.

So I became everyone's plus one. My wife Angela walked into the living room holding two wedding invitations while I was watching TV. I need to bring grant to these weddings, she said. Grant was her twenty year old assistant at work. Why grant? I asked, genuinely confused. My whole department will be there if I bring you. Everyone gossips about me playing favorites with him since I'm his boss, but if we go together as co workers, it looks better. She said it like she'd been practicing this speech. Plus, my annual review is next month. My boss will be at both weddings watching everything. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. You're taking grant as your date instead of your husband? It's eject for my promotion. She waved the invitations at me. You hate weddings anyway. You always complain about the small talk. That was true, but this felt wrong. Fine, I said, take Grant. Angela smiled like she'd won the lottery. I knew you'd be logical about this. First wedding came around and Angela spent two hours getting ready, trying on three different dresses before leaving with grant at noon. I was sitting on the couch feeling pretty weird about the whole thing, when my phone rang at 2. It was Ryan from my gym. Hey man, you coming to my wedding today? I nearly dropped my phone. Your wedding is today? Yeah. Didn't Angela tell you? She works with my dad. You're on the list. I looked at the invitation stuck on our fridge, and my heart started racing. She said she was bringing someone else. I told him. So what? I invited you separately. We basketball three times a week. An hour later, I walked into that wedding feeling like I was about to cause chaos. Angela's face went completely white when she spotted me at the bar, and I'm not gonna lie, it felt pretty good. She basically sprinted over with grant trailing behind, looking confused. What are you doing here? Ryan invited me from basketball. You didn't tell me Ryan was getting married. You didn't ask whose wedding it was. Her boss appeared beside us, holding a beer. Oh, good, you're both here, he said, and his face changed. Wait. Why aren't you sitting together? Angela's mouth opened and closed like a fish. Grant needed to network. Her boss looked between us, and I could see him putting pieces together. You brought him instead of your husband? The words just hung there. It's complicated, Angela stammered. Her boss walked away, shaking his head, and I knew this was already backfiring. Three weeks later was the second wedding, and Angela left with grant again like nothing had happened. This time, I didn't need a phone call, though. The bride, Julie, was my cousin's best friend, and she'd invited me months ago when she heard Angela Couldn't make it. I just never corrected Angela's Assumption about whose wedding it was. I showed up early to help set up chairs, and when Angela walked in with grant, she literally froze in the doorway. How was all she managed to say? Julie invited me. She's basically family. You knew? You never asked. The reception was absolutely brutal for Angela. Her co workers kept coming up to me looking concerned. Are you two separated? One asked. No. Angela just prefers bringing grant to weddings, I said loud enough for others to hear. Mother pulled me aside, looking uncomfortable. Is she having an affair with him? You'd have to ask her, I replied. By the time speeches started, the entire department was whispering and shooting looks at their table. Grant looked like he wanted to crawl under the table and die. Angela kept trying to do damage control, but every word made it sound worse. Her co workers exchanged these knowing looks that made her face turn red. Her boss found me during dessert and pulled me aside.

I tried to explain to the six armed officers that I didn't know anything about any murders, but my neighbor Karen held up her iPad, showing a Powerpoint titled Serial Killer Next Door evidence by Karen. She flipped to the first evidence slide, looking at me with a smug I got you this time, Beach Express. It began three months ago, Karen said, like a modern day Sherlock Holmes. She noticed I kept odd hours and had blackout curtains on all my windows. The first incident happened when she saw me dragging heavy black garbage bags to my car at two in the morning. The next day, she found red stains all over my driveway that looked exactly like blood. She started documenting everything for the safety of the neighborhood. He would have delivery trucks come to this house at night with tattooed men unloading large packages and body sized boxes. He took every single one down to his garage and came out with black bags once he's finished the job. Our other neighbors who had come out to check on the scene gasped at the horrific Powerpoint. Full pictures of the men, the suspicious truck, and me wearing protective eyeglasses and an apron stained with something red. Karen flipped through more extensive evidence. Photos of body parts visible through my garage window, recordings of Bonesaw sounds at midnight, even a video of me splashed with a Red liquid while holding a chainsaw. I'm telling you now. Oh, it's not what it looks like, I said, trying to hold back my laughter. Karen laughed. We're not blind. Don't even try to play your tricks on us. You're just another Jason wannabe. Jason Derulo? I teased. What the. No. Jason Vorhees from those horror films? You know what? Never mind. She flipped through more pieces of evidence. The ring doorbell recording of me handing over a red stain in suitcase to the delivery men, and a picture of a shrunken head in my car. When the officers saw the footage of a victim who sat in my living room, pale and unmoving, they panicked. Check the property. Start with the garage. Go! The officers entered my garage with weapons drawn and found mannequins on professional racks with latex limbs hanging to dry. They found containers of the red liquid labeled corn syrup mix Episode 6 and a toy chainsaw tagged testing zombie scene 4B. They clicked on different files from my computer, listening to different creepy sound effects and screams. Oh, hey, wasn't this on strange? Your things on something, one officer said, recognizing one of the props. He whistled at the three thousand dollar invoice attached. Another officer picked up the body part that was seen on Karen's Powerpoint and realized it was just foam latex. They brought out a few of them to the lawn. Karen's hands shook as she picked up the lightweight props. I Don't understand, she mumbled. That's when I explained everything. I used to work corporate until I lost my job. And I figured, you know, maybe I could start over, do something I really loved. So I got into special effects, became an artist. I loved horror movies and wanted to make

The bride's name isn't Susie. My best friend Janice was literally mid vow when Father Angelo raised his hand and said, I'm sorry, but I need to ask something. Where is Susie? Everyone in the church went dead silent because we all knew the bride's name wasn't Susie. The groom's face went white and Janice's voice cracked when she said, who's Susie? I stood there as maid of honor, holding her bouquet, watching her eyes fill with tears just thinking her fiance had another woman. An elderly woman in the back stood up and pointed directly at me. That's her! That's Susie! The whole church turned to stare at me, include putting my best friend Janice. But I was just as confused as everyone was in the room. My mom rushed out of her pew and ran to the altar before the old woman could finish walking down the aisle. Mom grabbed my arm, trying to pull me away from the ceremony. We need to leave right now! Janice grabbed my other arm, crying, did you sleep with my fiance? Mom tugged my arm harder. The old woman reached the altar and slammed her cane down onto the marble floor with a bang. Please let me speak to my granddaughter in peace before it's too late. The entire congregation whispered with questions and rumors. My mom hissed, stay away from us! Everyone stared at her like she was crazy. The Old woman ignored her, pulling out a travel sized photo album. This is your father holding you as a baby. This is you in my arms. This is our family. The kind looking man in the photos looked exactly like me. Same eyes, same hair color, even same smile. My mom tried to grab them, screaming, you have no right to do this here! This is a wedding! She deserves to know her father loved her and that he left this world trying to find her. She yelled back in a voice so clearly in pain that it made the entire church go quiet. My Grandmother's voice calmed. Your mother took you away when you were just a toddler. Changed her name, changed yours. But by some miracle, I found you. Now we can be complete again. She held out her hand with a soft smile. Please. I nearly grabbed it until my mom burst out with a horrifying truth. Took her away number. There was a restraining order against you. The church gasped, watching more drama slowly unfold. Ask her why, my mom demanded confidently. I looked at my grandma, whose face now changed from sweet and sympathetic to something cold and judgmental. She kept her mouth shut. My mom laughed. That's right. You can't say it, can you? Your grandmother drove your father to his last breath. She is the reason he's gone. And the reason I fled with you in my arms on the night before the Funeral. You poisoned him against his own family. My grandmother screamed back, slamming her cane against the floor again, this time with shaking hands. Even now you deny it. Right there at the altar, my mom announced the truth. My grandmother had refused to believe her son had bipolar disorder and needed medication. She kept telling him the doctors were wrong.

Growing up, my sister Kayla made everything about her. My birthday parties, she got gifts, too, because I wouldn't exist without her. Every graduation, every achievement hijacked. When I won the science fair in 8th grade, she convinced my parents to throw her a supportive sister party the same night. When I got into college, she announced her engagement at my Celebration dinner. When I graduated with honors, she showed up in a revealing red dress and spent the whole ceremony flirting with professors. The pattern never stopped. Kayla had this way of making herself the victim. Whenever I achieved anything, you're so lucky, she'd say. I sacrificed so much for you. Growing up. Meanwhile, I was the one babysitting her kids while she partied through her 20s. I was the one lending her money she never paid back. I was the one covering for her when she bailed on family obligations. When I got engaged to my Indian fiance, Priya, I was terrified Kayla would find a way to ruin it. Sure enough, at our engagement party, she immediately joked about wearing white to our wedding. It'll be so funny, she laughed, like in the movies, I'll be the mysterious woman in white. She even made this dramatic pose, hand on her forehead like some soap opera actress. I pulled her aside and told her, absolutely not. This is my one day. Kayla, please. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic, that it was just a joke. God, you're so sensitive. It's not like anyone would actually confuse me for the bride. But she seemed to agree to drop it. Two weeks later, I found out she'd gone behind my back and asked Priya directly, your sister seems really excited about her dress choice. Priya mentioned casually over dinner, she kept asking about fabric and styles. My blood ran cold. I knew exactly what that meant. I freaked out on Priya explaining Kayla's entire history of stealing my moments. She did this at my high school graduation, wore this attention grabbing red dress and flirted with all the dads. My college graduation, she announced her pregnancy. She'll definitely show up in some elaborate white gown designed to make everyone look at her instead of us. That night, I had a complete breakdown, sobbing, hyperventilating. 28 years of suppressed resentment came pouring out. I was convinced Priya would see my toxic family dynamics and run for the hills. Who wants to marry into that kind of drama? Instead, she held me and said something genius. You know, white isn't the bridal color in Indian weddings, right? I froze. In all my panic about Kayla's manipulation tactics, I completely forgotten that crucial detail. Kayla had no idea Priya would be wearing a stunning red lehenga with intricate gold embroidery. Wedding day arrives. I'm getting ready with my groomsmen when my cousin Texts, dude, your sister just walked in looking like she thinks she's the bride. My stomach dropped until I remembered Priya's words. Then I actually started laughing. Kayla struts in wearing this elaborate white ball gown, strapless with a cathedral train, clearly custom made and expensive. She'd even hired a professional makeup artist, had her hair done in an elaborate updo with white flowers. The confused looks from Priya's family were absolutely priceless. Indian weddings are vibrant, colorful celebrations. And here's Kayla looking like she wandered in from a completely different century. During the ceremony, I kept glancing at Kayla. She looked increasingly uncomfortable as she realized everyone was staring at her for all the wrong reasons. Priya looked absolutely radiant in her traditional red and gold.

I came home from grocery shopping to find thirteen year old Adrian in the living room surrounded by the massacred remains of every single one of two year old Burt's beloved toys. Cotton stuffing everywhere like snow, fabric torn to shreds scattered across the carpet. Burt was screaming so hard his face was purple, while my husband stood over Adrian shouting she's lost her mind! Pointing at the destruction with a shaking finger. I was watching TV with Bert and she just started ripping apart every toy he owns like a psycho. I dropped the grocery bags and ran to pick up Bert, who is sobbing, trying to piece together his favorite teddy bear. Adrian, what have you done? She looked up at me with tears streaming down her face, holding something in her closed fist while my husband grabbed her hard enough to leave marks. Put something shiny in his mouth, she shouted, yanking her hand away from her father. I asked him where he got it and he pointed at his teddy bear. And when I looked inside, I found these. She opened her hand to show a diamond ring, a gold necklace, and several earrings. That's when my husband's face went from angry to a flash of panic. You had no right to destroy his toys over some costume jewelry, he quickly stammered. They were hidden inside the teddy bear, Adrian said, looking At me instead of her father, her voice trembling but determined. Burt could have to death. And I saw dad in here last week with his sewing kit, saying he was fixing rips. My husband laughed, but it sounded forced. I was fixing them because they were falling apart. And that's just jewelry I found at work during my security rounds, he said. I picked up one of the destroyed bears and found a small, neat slit in the back that had been hand sewn shut. The jewelry inside wasn't cheap like he said. It was real diamonds catching the light. You hid jewelry in our baby's toys? I asked. I was going to pawn it, my husband said quickly, but his voice was getting higher and sweat was beating on his forehead. Extra money for the family. You know how tight things have been. The elephant had three rings, the rabbit had a bracelet and earrings. The Dinosaur had a watch. Every single toy had something metal inside that could have killed bird if he swallowed it, Adrian said. You're being dramatic, my husband responded. I made sure the holes were secure, he then stammered. Why not just keep them in a drawer? I asked, staring at jewelry scattered across the floor. Why hide them in baby toys? My husband tried to grab the jewelry from the table, but Adrian was faster, pooping it up and backing away toward the wall. I know why he hid them in the Toys! Adrian said. Give those to me right now! My husband suddenly shot up, moving toward her with his hands outstretched. Adrian ran behind me, pressing against my back. This necklace has an engraving, Adrian said, her voice shaking as she held up a silver chain that caught the light. It says to Ruby, love, mom, on the back. Who's Ruby? I asked innocently. My husband's face started turning. And

My son Brandon texted happy birthday, mom to our family group chat on the wrong day. When I corrected him, he said, close enough, mom. I turned 70 alone that year. Meanwhile, they threw my grandchildren's other grandmother, penny, a surprise 65th with 50 guests and a string quartet. I know because I saw the photos on Facebook. They captioned it, celebrating the world's best grandma. When I had hip surgery, I took the bus home because Brandon was slammed at work and couldn't leave. My daughter Kenzie, had a thing with the kids. Prepared meals standing on a walker, refilled prescriptions myself. Slept in the recliner because I couldn't manage stairs alone. Two months later, Kenzie's mother in law had her gallbladder removed. Kenzie moved in for three weeks. Brandon delivered groceries daily. They hired a private nurse. I watched their children for free every summer while they vacationed in Europe. 10 years of summers. No thank you, no payment. Just mom has nothing else to do. Anyway, they told friends childcare was taken care of like I was hired help. I missed my late husband Gio's sister's funeral because they already booked non refundable tickets. Kensley's mother in law babysits twice a year. They pay her $500 each time because her time is valuable. Christmas morning, I sat alone until 4 p m. Because they went to Kensley's husband David's family first. Traffic was bad, Kinsley explained. Though they live closer to me, my gift was a drugstore candle still priced at three dollars and ninety nine cents. Penny got a weekend spa retreat. I painted Kinsley's wedding portrait for three months. She left it in the basement untouched. Penny's blurry phone photo got framed in gold on the mantle. Kinsley asked me to cater her dinner party, then introduced me as the help when I stayed to serve. The next week, she hired a two thousand dollar chef for Penny's Book Club of six and then drove past my house to take penny grocery shopping during the ice storm that trapped me inside for four days. She doesn't like driving in bad weather, he explained. When I called hungry, neither do I. I said, you'll figure it out, mom. You always do. They started lying to maintain the favoritism. Kenzi told me Thanksgiving was canceled. Family flew. I delivered homemade soup to their door and saw Penny's car in the driveway and heard laughter inside. I walked back to my car crying. When Geo died, they invited penny to the family only viewing. I found out when she hugged me there, saying how honored she felt to be included in such an intimate moment. My own sister wasn't invited because Kenzi said immediate family only. Then something unexpected happened. Penny had been entertaining her country club with story. Kensley confided in her Brandon's fertility struggles, Kensley's anxiety medication, their financial problems. It exploded at a charity Auction. When her drunk friend asked Kensley about her little Prozac situation in front of everyone, Kensley discovered penny had been calling them my son's burden at her book club for years. The woman they'd chosen over me had made them her punchline. After Dio's funeral, I started teaching painting at the community center. Eight year old Manny arrived first. Suspended from school, his grandmother working doubles. I handed him a brush. He stabbed the canvas with rage, then returned the next day. Soon, seven neighborhood kids sprawled across my living room floor, turning feelings into colors. I invited Kensley to see Manny's first painting. Can't today, mom. Maybe later. Later never came. Brandon promised to attend our art show. He forgot. The kids started calling me Grandma D. Their parents invited me to every recital, game, graduation. I taught them Geo's cloud technique, while my own grandchildren didn't know I painted. Three years passed. Manny got into art school with our portfolio. Aisha painted a mural on my garage. Deshawn sold his first painting, bought me roses. My refrigerator bloomed with their art. My phone buzzed with goodnight, Grandma D texts. Meanwhile, I kept reaching out, offered Kinsley painting lessons for her kids there

Meanwhile, I was the one babysitting her kids while she part through her 20s. I was the one lending her money she never paid back. I was the one covering for her when she bailed on family obligations. When I got engaged to my Indian fiance, Priya, I was terrified Kayla would find a way to ruin it. Sure enough, at our engagement party, she immediately joked about wearing white to our wedding. It'll be so funny, she laughed. Like in the movies. I'll be the mysterious woman in white. She even made this dramatic pose, hand on her forehead like some soap opera actress. I pulled her aside and told her, absolutely not. This is my one day. Kayla, please. She rolled her eyes and said, I Was being dramatic that it was just a joke. God, you're so sensitive. It's not like anyone would actually confuse me for the bride, but she seemed to agree to drop it. Two weeks later, I found out she'd gone behind my back and asked directly. Your sister seems really excited about her dress choice, Priya mentioned casually over dinner. She kept asking about fabric and styles. My blood ran cold. I knew exactly what that meant. I freaked out on Priya explaining Kayla's entire history of stealing my moments. She did this at my high school graduation. Wore this attention grabbing red dress and flirted with all the dads. At college graduation, she announced her pregnancy. She'll definitely show up in some elaborate white gown designed to make everyone look at her instead of us. That night, I had a complete breakdown. Sobbing, ventilating. 28 years of suppressed resentment came pouring out. I was convinced Priya would see my toxic family dynamics and run for the hills. Who wants to marry into that kind of drama? Instead, she held me and said something genius. You know white isn't the bridal color in Indian weddings, right? I froze. In all my panic about Kayla's manipulation tactics, I completely forgotten that crucial detail. Kayla had no idea Priya would be wearing a stunning red lehengas with intricate gold old embroidery. Wedding day arrives. I'm getting ready with my groomsmen when my cousin texts, dude, your sister just walked in looking like She thinks she's the bride. My stomach dropped until I remembered Priya's words. Then I actually started laughing. Kayla struts in wearing this elaborate white ball gown, strapless with a cathedral train, clearly custom made and expensive. She'd even hired a professional makeup artist and had her hair done in an elaborate updo with white flowers. The confused looks from Priya's family were absolutely priceless. Indian weddings are vibrant, colorful celebrations. And here's Kayla looking like she wandered in from a completely different century. During the ceremony, I kept glancing at Kayla. She looked increasingly uncomfortable as she realized everyone was staring at her for all the wrong reasons. Priya looked absolutely radiant in her traditional red and gold, surrounded by family and brilliant blues, greens and purples. While Kayla stood out like a sore thumb in stark white. But the absolute best part came during the reception. Priya's grandmother, this tiny eighty year old woman who'd flown in from Mumbai, walked straight up to Kayla. In her thick accent, she loudly asked, Zeta, why are you dressed for a funeral at a wedding? Did someone die that we should know about? The entire hall went silent, then erupted in

Growing up, Kenzie never let me forget my place in our friendship. Every party, every hangout, every introduction came with the same unspoken rule. I was the designated ugly fat friend who made her shine brighter. This is my friend who's really funny, she'd say, which everyone knew meant not pretty it every single time. Kenzie was gorgeous, I knew that. But her constant reminders made me believe I was worthless. Was I really that hideous? When I was 22, something shifted. I needed a physical outlet for my anxiety and found a group on for a rock climbing gym across town. The first day, my hands shook on every hold. But something about solving each route, finding my path up the wall, made me feel powerful. That's when I discovered my escape. I started climbing four nights a week in secret. My hands LED, then calloused. Ice my forearms after every session. Watch technique videos until 2:00am, practice grip strength exercises at my desk. Wednesday and Friday nights, I climbed with the regulars, including this guy, Sebastian, who became my climbing partner. We'd spot each other, celebrate sends, build genuine friendship through shared challenges. I never mentioned him to Kenzie. She wouldn't care about my gym friends anyway. Meanwhile, Kenzie had become obsessed with her marketing firm crush. She constantly prove I was the ugly friend by making me stand Next to her in mirrors. See the difference? She'd say, adjusting her hair. Some people just have it. Others are good listeners. She'd drag me shopping, hold up identical outfits against us both. This would look cute on me. You should stick to black. It's slimming. What killed me was how she document everything on Instagram, always cropping me out or positioning me behind her natural beauty. She'd caption photos where I was literally holding her phone's ring light. I started wondering if she was right. Maybe I was fooling myself, thinking climbing made me worth something. Kenzie's birthday party was approaching. This rooftop bar event she'd been planning for months. She'd invited her entire office, especially her crush. He finally rsvp'd. Yes! She squealed. I need you there. don't talk too much. Just laugh at my jokes and leave early if I give you the signal. The night of the party, she made me wear this shapeless black dress. It's so you. She lied. As guests arrived, she positioned me strategically. Visible enough to make her look charitable for having an ugly friend, hidden enough not to distract. Then her crush walked in with three friends. Kenzie grabbed my arm, whispered, remember your wallpaper? But when he scanned the crowd, his eyes stopped on me. His whole face lit up. Oh, my god, red! He called out, using my climbing nickname. Kenzie froze. Sebastian practically ran over his friends, trailing behind. Guys, this is the girl I've Been telling you about the one who sent that impossible 5 11 route last week? He turned to me, eyes bright with genuine excitement. I can't believe you're here. Wait. You know Kenzie. For the next hour, Sebastian couldn't stop talking about our climbing adventures. He told everyone about the time I helped him overcome his fear of overhangs, how I taught him this specific, like you hook technique, how watching me climb had made him a better athlete. His friends already knew stories about me. Sebastian had apparently been talking about his badass climbing partner for months. Kenzie stood there. Designer dress and perfect makeup useless against authentic connection. How long have you been doing this together? Someone asked. Six months, Sebastian said, then looked at me with this soft expression. Best six months of my week. Every week, Kenzie tried to interject, mentioning the marketing campaign they'd worked on together. Sebastian Bear

My mom has been begging me to put more thought into my appearance for as long as I can remember. I always ignored her because I thought I just look normal. But then she started insulting how I look every day. One morning she stood behind me at breakfast side dramatically and said, for God's sake, just do something different with your hair at least. It would make a world of difference. Just try something new, she pleaded. Anything would be more interesting to girls than this. She pointed to my ruffled head for some reason. That was the last straw. I said sure thing and headed to the bathroom with a new sense of purpose. I started small with a middle part and enough gel to make it look like plastic. Mom seemed pleased at first until she realized I'd used her expensive salon gel and the entire forty dollar bottle gone. It takes product to make changes, I reminded her when she found the empty container. She had to explain to her hairdresser why she needed more gel after one day, and the woman judged her hard for letting her teenage son waste professional products. The next week I went to her barber without telling her and got a perm. Not a settle wave, but a full 1980 style perm that made me look like a poodle. Mom had to Take me to her cousin's engagement party looking like I'd stuck my finger in an electrical socket, and everyone kept asking if it was for a school play. He's experimenting with his look, she explained weekly while her relatives took photos that would definitely end up in the family group chat. Then I discovered temporary hair chalk and started changing colors daily to match my outfits. Blue on Monday, red on Tuesday, purple on Wednesday, leaving colorful smudges on every pillow, towel, and headrest in the house. Mom's white couch looked like a rainbow had died on it, and she had to explain to guests why everything in our house was stained with pastels. Her car's leather seats were permanently tinted pink from the time I wore magenta in the rain. I showed up to her office when she forgot her lunch, sporting tiny braids with ribbon woven through them that I'd spent six hours creating. Her co workers tried not to laugh as I hugged her in front of everyone, leaving her blazer covered in the baby powder I'd used to make the braids look distinguished. Her boss asked if I was going through something, and she had to smile and say she encouraged me to express myself. The man bun phase was particularly rough for her, as I grew it out just long enough to make the world's smallest bun that stuck straight up like an antenna. She had to sit behind me at church while people watched My tiny bun wobble during hymns. The pastor's wife asked if I was becoming Buddhist, and mom had to have a whole conversation about religious tolerance. Then came the frosted tips. Except I didn't go to a salon and used actual cake frosting at first because I misunderstood the term. Mom found me in the bathroom covered in vanilla icing, and even after I used real bleach, my tips were orange instead of blonde. She had to take me to get school photos looking like Guy Fieri's younger brother, and those pictures would haunt us forever. I invested in a crimping iron and started crimping random sections so my head looked like I've been partially electrocuted. Mom begged me to stop, but I reminded her she wanted interesting and nothing was more interesting than asymmetrical crimp. Her mother came to visit and asked why mom was letting me walk around looking like I'd survived a lightning strike. The oils came next. So much hair oil that I looked wet constantly and left grease stains on everything I touched. Mom had to replace three pillowcases and explain to the

I'm a family court clerk, and last week the medinas were divorcing and fighting over who gets to keep the house, claiming the other was too financially reckless to own property. Both kept presenting evidence. He bought a year supply of healing crystals for our cat. He bought a boat. We live in Arizona. She hired a life coach for her succulent plants. Mediator Betty looked like she needed a drink at 9 a m. I'd like to hear from your daughter, since she's listed as a witness. Lola walks in dressed like a tiny accountant, dragging two suitcases and a filing cabinet. She looked like she was moving in permanently. Mediator Betty stares at the luggage mountain. Lola, we're just having a conversation. With all due respect, ma'am, you haven't met my parents. Going to need evidence. Can you tell us about your parents money habits? Lola opens the first suitcase and pulls out a binder. I brought three years of receipts. Receipts? Yes, ma'am. Filed under evidence. My parents shouldn't have credit cards. Betty almost spits out her coffee. Excuse me. Lola opens to a page with colorful charts. I've been tracking their spending since I was 11, ma'am. What kind of spending? Let's start with exhibit A. Lola holds up a next statement. This is Mom's fourth treadmill. She buys a new one every year because this one will be different. They're all in the garage. We Call it the treadmill graveyard. Exhibit B. Dad bought a three thousand dollar espresso machine. He only drinks instant coffee, ma'am. He thought it would inspire him to upgrade. Exhibit C. Mom orders Doordash from the restaurant that's literally next door. Last month she paid forty seven dollars for a twelve dollar sandwich. The restaurant is 40 feet away. And exhibit D, or dad belongs to three different gyms because each one has that special machine. He pays one hundred twenty dollars a month total. He goes twice a month. That's six. $60 per workout. Betty is covering her mouth. Lola, how did you start handling the money? Someone had to pay the electric Bill, ma'am. They kept forgetting it wasn't on auto pay. Lola opens the second suitcase. This is Mom's online boutique phase. She bought wholesale designer handbags from sketchy websites. Our garage looks like a knockoff purse museum. She sold exactly three bags. How. How much did she spend? $8,000, made $75 back. The mediator turns to the mom Missus, Medina. They looked real in the pictures. Lola continues. Dad's no better. He bought a truck to flip it. He put $5,000 of modifications on it. Damaged LED lights underneath that only light pink. And an attached disco ball inside. It's now worth less than before he bought it. May I present exhibit E. Lola pulls out two jars from the filing cabinet. This jar contains all the warranties dad bought that we've actually used. It's empty. This jar contains receipts for every warranty he's purchased. 83 warranties totaling $4,200. You never know when you'll need them. Dad protests. Dad, you bought a 3 year warranty on a 12 dollar phone case. The warranty cost 15 dollars. Lola pulls out a credit card Bill. Mom has a storage unit for her Amazon returns she never returned. She's paying 150 dollars a month to store things she doesn't want. I'll return them eventually. Mom, some of these boxes are from 2,018. What about your father? Betty asks. Dad bought a fishing boat. He gets seasick. He's used it once and threw up. He had to be towed.

My aunt literally hid her purse in her car trunk when she saw me walking up to my grandparents 60th wedding anniversary party. Through the window, I watched my uncle whisper something to his wife and she immediately took off her diamond earrings and shoved them in her pocket. 28 years old and my family still treated me like I was about to rob them blind because I got arrested for shoplifting when I was 15. The whole extended family was there for the anniversary Celebration, which meant I got to experience the full spectrum of their paranoia and disgust. My cousin made a big show of counting the bottles in the liquor cabinet loud enough for everyone to hear while staring directly at me, just making sure we know what we started with. He announced to the room like he was doing everyone a favor. My mother pulled me aside and whispered that she'd already warned everyone to keep their medications locked up because we can't be too careful with your history. I haven't touched anything stronger than coffee in eight years, but she still introduces me to people as her troubled one who's trying to get back on track. My uncle took it to another level when I walked past the room where they piled everyone's coats and he literally stood guard in the doorway blocking my path. The bathroom is the other direction. He Said with this smug little smile that made me want to scream. The anniversary dinner was even worse because they stuck me at the overflow table in the kitchen with the kids under 10, even though there were empty seats in the dining room. One of the teenagers asked why I was sitting with them, and my aunt loudly explained that sometimes adults need to provision 2, which got a huge laugh from the other room. While everyone else ate off my grandmother's China, I got a plastic plate because apparently I couldn't be trusted with anything breakable. My uncle kept walking through to check on things, which meant staring at me like I might pop get the salt shakers while his wife counted the silverware drawer right in front of me. Then my uncle decided to move my grandmother's antique mirror to the garage because he didn't trust me around something that valuable. He was carrying it through the dining room, making another speech about family heirlooms and personal responsibility when he tripped over his own grandson's toy truck and went straight through the sliding glass door. The mirror shattered and a huge shard went straight into his thigh while smaller pieces sliced his arms and neck. Bloods started spurting everywhere in these rhythmic pulses, and everyone just stood there screaming while he turned white and started losing consciousness. My aunt was freaking about calling 9, 1 1, but fumbling with her phone and dropping it in the blood While my mother fainted and my cousin vomited on the carpet, I jumped over the kitchen table and slid through the blood to get to him while ripping off my belt in one motion. Nobody touch anything and someone get me clean towels, vodka from the freezer and super glue from the junk drawer. Now I barked while using my knee to apply pressure above the wound. The femoral artery was nicked and he had maybe three minutes before he bled out. So I used my belt as a tourniquet while everyone stood there frozen. Another cousin finally brought supplies while I worked to stop the bleeding from his neck with one hand and maintained pressure with my knee. When the emts burst through the door seven minutes later, one of.

My best friend Claire was dying and needed me to make her a promise that would destroy my marriage. We were sitting in the hospice room while her three kids colored in the hallway when she grabbed my hand and asked me to adopt them after she was gone. Her boys were 11 and 9, and her daughter had just turned seven. Their dad had overdosed two years earlier, and with Claire's parents dead and her sister in Germany, there was nobody else. I wanted to say yes immediately, my husband had already told me that if I even considered taking them, we were done. Our son Caleb was 12 and severely autistic, requiring constant supervision that consumed our entire lives. My husband worked nights so I could work days, and we tagged each other like wrestlers because Caleb couldn't be left alone for five minutes without potentially hurting himself. We hadn't been on a date in three years or had a conversation that wasn't about therapy, schedules, or medications. Adding three traumatized kids would push us past our breaking point, and he had made it clear he would leave before letting that happen. But Claire was the only person who showed up when Caleb was diagnosed while everyone else disappeared. She brought groceries when I couldn't leave the house and watched him during meltdowns so I could shower, and never acted like we were A burden. The social worker visited the day after Claire died, and the visit went exactly as I expected. Caleb had a meltdown when she arrived and spent 40 minutes hitting himself while I tried to calm him down. My husband stood in the corner with arms crossed while the social worker took notes and asked how we would manage three additional children when we were clearly overwhelmed. He laughed out loud at that question and walked out, slamming the door so hard the picture frames rattled. The kids were in emergency foster placement for 72 hours, then would be separated into different homes unless family stepped forward to take them. The oldest had started wetting the bed and refusing to eat, while the middle boy wouldn't speak and just sat humming and rocking. The little girl kept asking when Mommy was coming back from heaven. My husband found me crying in Caleb's room and delivered the ultimatum I had been dreading since Claire asked for my promise. If you do this, I'm filing for divorce and seeking primary custody of Caleb because you're being irresponsible with his care. The words came out flat and mechanical, the way he processed anything too heavy to feel. Part of me understood, because Caleb would suffer if we tried integrating three grieving children into our controlled routine. But the oldest had memorized every Pokemon and could talk about them for hours, which would connect with Caleb's identical obsession. The middle child moved like A ghost and wouldn't disturb Caleb's need for predictability, while the little girl understood different meant special because Claire had taught her that these weren't random foster kids, but children who knew our house and called me Auntie with nobody else who even knew their middle names. The foster family called that night because the little girl wouldn't stop screaming and the oldest had tried running away twice looking for my house. The little girl's wailing came through the phone, begging for her mommy or me or anyone who smelled familiar. While the foster mother asked if I could fix this over the phone. My husband watched from the doorway as I lied that everything would work out when we both knew the system would swallow them whole. You can't save everyone, he said after I

Growing up, my brother Andrew could literally burn the house down, and mom would blame the matches. When he was 12, he actually did set our garage on fire trying to make a flamethrower. Mom's response was, boys will be boys. At least he's being creative. Meanwhile, I graduated valedictorian and she missed my ceremony because Andrew had a headache that day. Every morning, Andrew got gourmet breakfasts while I ate generic cereal. When report cards came out, my straight A's got a nod, while his C+ in math warranted a Celebration dinner because he really tried his best. Christmas mornings were the worst. Mountains of wrapped gifts for Andrew, practical stuff like socks and school supplies for me. When dad got cancer during my junior year, everything got worse. I was juggling AP classes, working at the library, and helping with dad's medications. Mom hired Andrew a private tutor so the stress wouldn't hurt his precious. The average I was staying up until 3:00am studying after spending hours cleaning up around the house. Dad passed two months before my graduation. Even then, mom barely acknowledged my valedictorian speech because Andrew was having a really hard time. He skipped the ceremony, entirely too emotional. So mom stayed home with him instead of watching me graduate. College was brutal. Despite dad setting up a fun for both of us, it mysteriously disappeared into medical bills. I scrambled for scholarships and loans while mom somehow found money to send Andrew to an expensive sports academy in Florida. He quit after three weeks because the vibe wasn't right. That program cost more than my entire freshman year tuition. I worked my behind off Dean's list every semester. Two part time jobs, living in a tiny apartment shared with three guys. Meanwhile, Andrew was home rent free, finding himself through expensive hobbies. Mom happily funded gaming setup worth $2,000 that's now collecting dust. Season tickets for his sports blogging phase that lasted two months. Fast forward 10 years. I'm killing it as a senior consultant. Finally paid off my loans, living in a nice apartment. Andrew is still at home at 28, trying to become a fitness influencer or whatever his latest phase is. Andrew started texting me about investment advice and business ideas. Mom calling more frequently, making comments about success for children, supporting their parents, sending me articles about family wealth management. I knew something was coming. Last Saturday morning, they show up unannounced. Mom pushes past me into my apartment, doesn't even wait for an invitation. First thing she does is look around like she's appraising the place. Nice setup you got here, she says, running her fingers along my coffee table. Must be doing pretty well for yourself. Andrew flops down on my couch like he owns it. Immediately pulls out his phone, doesn't even say hello. Then mom pulls out an actual spreadsheet. She sits down across from me and spreads it on my dining table like we're having a business meeting. I've been thinking about your family obligations. She starts. You owe me roughly $150,000 for raising you. Medical bills, school supplies, food, housing. I kept all the receipts. She's pointing to different lines on her spreadsheet. Completely serious. Plus, Andrew's got this amazing business opportunity. Fitness coaching app. Revolutionary concept. He just needs about $75,000 to get started. And with your connections, I'm sitting there listening to this insanity, thinking about all those years.

Cousins I grew up with were sharing screenshots of our old photos with comments like, can't believe I trusted this creep. I waited every single day for police to show up with handcuffs. Every knock on my door made my heart stop. Every unknown phone number sent me into panic attacks, thinking it was detectives or lawyers. I lost everything, piece by piece. My job, At the auto shop because I couldn't focus. Kept making stupid mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss, Mike, finally sat me down after three months and said whatever was happening at home needed to stay there. But I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment four months later when I couldn't make rent. Moved in with my buddy Jay Jake, who let me crash on his couch. But even Jake started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Dude, where's your family? It's been six months and I've never seen a single relative. I made up lies about them living far away, being busy, having drama. Dating became impossible. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried seeing asked to meet my parents after two months. I panicked and told her they passed in a car accident. She was so sympathetic it made me sick. Second girl saw through everything. When she noticed I had zero family photos in my apartment, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. When I couldn't give her a straight answer, she was gone by morning. Holidays destroyed me completely. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call, someone who cared they existed. I drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents driveway. Knowing they were all inside laughing and eating together without me. I finally moved 3 States away to Colorado and started completely over. New job at a different auto shop, new apartment, new friends who knew nothing about my past. For years, I lived like I had no family. Like I just appeared out of nowhere as an adult. Never dated seriously, because I couldn't risk anyone digging too deep into my background. Built walls so high, I forgot what it felt like to trust.

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently. And just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was 9 p m. On a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key. Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never or seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up straight like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch Me. He picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear. From rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialled a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine, it's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed months ago? File everything. Tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my daughter. I hit another number. Dad, it's happening.

My brother died six months before starting his surgical residency, and my parents decided I would live his life for him. Not metaphorically honor his memory or carry on his spirit, but literally step into every plan he'd made and complete them. If he never died, they transferred his residency spot to my name through connections at the hospital board. And when I protested that I was a year into my teaching certification, my mother collapsed, bobbing that she couldn't lose both children, and my father said the medical school had already processed the paperwork. The takeover started small with clearing out his apartment, but then my mother began forwarding his mail and scheduling his appointments in my calendar. She'd call, pretending to be me to confirm medical conferences, and she signed my name on volunteer shifts at the children's hospital where dying kids expected their favorite resident. My father installed a tracking app on my phone to ensure I was following the schedule he printed, which included 5:00am gym sessions and meal prep Sundays. Because that's what my brother did. They moved his entire wardrobe into my apartment while I was at work and donated all my clothes to charity. I kept accident making things worse by mentioning my actual life. I'm judging the science fair next month, I'd say at dinner, and suddenly my parents were calling my principal saying I'd had a family Emergency. Every normal thing I said became evidence that I was dishonoring his memory, so I Learned to speak only about hospital rotations I was faking and surgical techniques I'd googled. The first day at the hospital, I stood frozen during rounds while the attending asked me to examine a patient's abdomen. My hands shook as I pressed randomly, hoping high school biology would gave me. But the attending's face grew dark and he pulled me aside, asking if I was drunk because no medical student would check for liver enlargement on the wrong side of the body. I mumbled about grief affecting my performance, and he softened, saying my brother would be proud, while never knowing my brother was the only one who'd actually attended medical school. My girlfriend Meredith watched me transform into someone she didn't recognize as I canceled plans for fake emergency surgeries and spoken medical terminology I'd memorized from flashcards. She found me at 3:00am in his scrubs, sobbing over anatomy textbooks, trying to learn four years of medical school before morning rounds. Then my mother invited Eleanor, my brother's fiance, to dinner at my apartment, using my phone while I slept. I woke up to find her in my kitchen cooking my brother's favorite meal, wearing the engagement ring he bought because my mother told her I wanted to. Can you where he left off? Eleanor was crying happy tears, saying she knew my brother sent me to complete their love story, and she'd Already told her parents we were getting married on the date they'd originally planned. Eleanor, you need to leave right now. This is completely insane, I said, and my mother's face went white with rage. She's your brother's soulmate, and you're going to throw that away for some elementary school teacher who makes half what a surgeon's wife deserves? I teach middle school science, and Meredith is a software engineer, but that doesn't matter, because I not my brother, and I'm never going to be him, no matter how many times you make me wear his clothes or sleep in his bed or pretend to understand why the human pancreas does whatever it does. Eleanor dropped the ring and ran out sobbing, while my mother picked it up and tried to force it into my hand, saying the wedding was

Then her friend told me I'd make you mine tonight. She panicked for months. My situationship cried about how much she needed me for her birthday. I'd spent all morning decorating her place while she was at the spa I paid for. When she walked through the door and everyone yelled, surprise! She squealed and hugged every single person except me. Oh, my god, you guys are the best! She gushed, talking to everyone while I stood there holding the custom cake I'd ordered three weeks ago. She literally walked around me like I was furniture. She ignored me while I tried to wish her a happy birthday. When her cousin asked, who's that guy by the cake? She actually said, oh, that's just Harry. He helped out a bit. Helped out? I'd literally coordinated every single person in this room and paid for everything. You must be the famous Harry, said a voice beside me as I set the cake down. And to find her best friend, Ariel, who I'd heard about constantly but never met. She was visiting from Seattle for the party. Brunette with kind eyes. Famous might be a stretch, I said, watching her take selfies with everyone while I became invisible in her living room. Ariel followed my gaze. She always does this, doesn't she? Keeps people at arms length while making them think they're close. She pick up a champagne glass. I've watched her do it. Since college. You seem different, though. Let me guess, Ariel continued, studying me. You met on Tinder. She said she wanted something real. The first date was perfect, right? Told you she could see something special with you. I stared at her, stunned. How did you? Because that's her script, Ariel said simply. Same one she used on the last three guys. Did she cry about her ex ruining her ability to trust? Ariel's words hit something deep. Eight months of I need more time to figure out what I want. Eight months of being introduced as just my name. Eight months of watching her keep her options open while I closed mine completely. Last month, when I brought up being exclusive again, she cried, said I was pressuring her, that she thought we were perfect how we were. I'd apologized. Apologize? For wanting to be her boyfriend officially. You decorated this whole place, didn't you? Ariel said, looking at the rose gold theme. I spent hours perfecting because I knew it was her favorite. Her friends told me you coordinated everything, even drove to three different stores to find those specific balloons. I nodded, watching her show some guy her tinder matches while laughing with her cousin. She deleted tinder, right? Ariel asked. Of. Of course not, I said. She needs it for networking. You know what's crazy? Ariel continued. In all our calls, she's never once called you her boyfriend. But she loses it when you don't text. Back fast enough. The truth of it stung. Just last week, she'd shown up at my apartment at 2:00am, crying because I'd fallen asleep and missed her calls, convinced I was with someone else. Ariel moved closer, her voice dropping. I came here to visit her, but really, I wanted to meet you. She talks about you constantly, but only when she's worried you might leave. It's always Harry might be seeing someone else. Or Harry didn't heart my message. Across the room, I saw her notice us talking. She immediately stopped mid conversation with her cousin. I'm tired of games, Ariel said suddenly. I'm 28. I want something real. Someone who shows up, who puts in effort, who doesn't need

Now they want me to fund their retirement. So my parents had been saving money for all three of us kids to go to college since we were babies. My older brother and sister both used theirs, went to the local state school, lived at home, worked part time jobs at target, in the mall for spending money. I'm the youngest, and I was different. While they were partying in high school, I was grinding. 4.0 GPA, valedictorian, captain of the debate team, studying every single night because I had bigger dreams than staying local. Senior year, I got a full ride scholarship to one of the top engineering programs in the country. Full tuition, room and board, everything covered. When I asked my parents if I could use my college fund for other stuff, maybe a car or to help with living expenses, they called a family meeting. They sat me down at the kitchen table with this whole serious lecture. The money was specifically saved for education expenses. Since your scholarship covers everything and you don't actually need it, we're not legally obligated to give it to you. It wouldn't be fair to your brother and sister who had to work part time jobs during school. I tried explaining that I'd worked way harder than either of them, that I'd sacrificed my entire social life, that I was saving them literally tens of thousands of dollars they'd plan to spend. My dad Just shook his head and said, that's not how this works. Two months later, they used my college money, the money they've been telling me was mine my whole life, to completely renovate their kitchen and take the whole family to Disney World. When I said I wouldn't be joining them on the vacation, my mom said I was being ungrateful and dramatic. Fine. The day after graduation, I moved out. My uncle got me a job as a welder's helper on a pipeline crew. These were hardcore blue collar guys making serious money in brutal auditions. They all thought I was insane to give up that kind of cash to go sit in classrooms. But I showed up every day at 5:00am, worked in 100 degree heat, got my hands destroyed, came home exhausted. The welder I was paired with actually gave me a two thousand dollar bonus at the end of summer because he'd expect I did me to quit after three days. But I stuck it out. Did that same routine for three summers straight. School year, perfect grades, great professors, amazing friends. Summer back with the pipeline crew, banking every dollar while my siblings were doing internships at coffee shops. I was making more than most adults. Got a co op position my senior year that LED to a job offer. Graduated with zero debt. Started traveling the world for work. Been doing it for 10 years now. No wife, no kids. Just building my career. And saving money like crazy. Then last month, I get this call from my dad. Hey, buddy. Your mom and I are thinking about retiring early. We know you're doing really well financially, and we were hoping you could help us out a little bit. I asked how much my brother and sister were contributing to their retirement fund. Long pause. Well, you know, they both have families now. Kids are expensive. They really can't afford to help out right now. I couldn't help but smile. Dad. That's

The way she said it, like allowing water made him generous, sent ice through my veins. Well, it's story time. Everyone eats, I said firmly, pushing the entire snack tray toward them. Different rules here. While the other children arrived, I watched Ava carefully portion out food to her sister, whispering, eat slow so you don't throw up. My stomach turned. They've done this before. Ava, I said quietly, during snack time, does your mommy play the Hunger Game, too? Sometimes, but she cheats. I caught her eating crackers in the bathroom once. Daddy made her play for a whole week after that. She kept crying and saying she was sorry. But rules are rules. I excused myself to get more supplies and called CPS for my office. I have two children here showing clear signs of systematic starvation, I whispered urgently. The older one hasn't eaten in four days and thinks it's a game. Back in the story room, I sat close to the girls during reading time. Ava leaned against me and I could feel her ribs through her dress. Do you play other games at home? I asked. During craft time, the strong game, Millie piped up. We stand with our arms up until someone drops them. Ava nodded. I lasted two hours yesterday. Daddy says we're building character. She showed me the underside of her arms. Bruises lined them where blood had pooled. Sometimes we play the quiet game in the cold shower. If you make noise, you stay.

My dad missed my graduation for a job interview. Mom promised he'd make it, but kept checking her phone anxiously during the entire ceremony. I felt my heart sink when I scanned the crowd and didn't see his face anywhere. After walking across that stage, I gripped my phone, waiting for something. No texts, no calls. Complete silence. Mom couldn't look me in the eyes. When I found her afterward, she hugged me way too tight and whispered, he really tried, sweetheart. My chest burned with anger. I couldn't hide anymore. At my graduation party, relatives kept asking about dad. Mom cycled through increasingly desperate excuses. Traffic jam, work emergency, car trouble, each lie more pathetic than the last. I watched her stumble through explanations while my shame grew deeper. My friend Jake pulled me aside and asked, you doing okay, man? I just laughed and said, he's been doing this since I was 7 years old, because it was absolutely true. He missed my championship basketball game where I scored the winning shot. Missed my debate team finals when I took first place. Even missed my 18th birthday party last year. Said he had to work late again that night. After everyone finally left, I sat alone staring at my diploma. Mom tried approaching me, but I cut her off immediately. I said, grabbing my car keys, I've heard every excuse before. I drove to my old elementary school playground and sat on the Same swing where dad used to push me before work completely consumed his life. Before he became just a distant voice sometimes heard. Coming home at 2:00am, something inside me finally broke that night. All the anger I'd bottled up for years spilled over at once. I pulled out my phone and texted him. Congratulations on showing me exactly where I rank in your priorities. Message delivered. Read immediately. When I got home after midnight, Dad's car was sitting in our driveway. I found him hunched over our kitchen table. Head.

I was eating breakfast when my mom walked up and slapped a cereal bowl right out of my hands. The bowl shattered on the floor, milk spraying everywhere. Stop! Stop stealing our food, you mosquito! She screamed. From now on, you buy your own groceries or you don't eat, period! I stared at her, shocked and covered in cold milk and Lucky Charms. For years, I've been using my employee discount at grocery stores and paying for most of it with my own cash. I didn't think I'd ever need to tell them, but now, all of a sudden, I'm a parasite, a freeloader. I kept my mouth shut, cleaned up the mess in silence. Then I went out, bought a few groceries for myself, kept every receipt and and labeled everything with my name. My parents smirked at each other over dinner that night, confident they'd finally save money without their thief bleeding them dry. When we went out to buy groceries, my parents acted arrogant, throwing expensive brands into the cart without looking at the price tags. Perrier sparkling water, truffle oil, Tide Pods. They made it to the cashier and saw the huge 400 dollar price. Their smiles completely disappeared. This place is price gouging! My dad yelled when he got home. It never cost this much before, but it did. It's just they never actually done the shopping themselves. Even at other stores, they ended Up buying pre cut fruit for $30 when whole fruit was $5. Someone convinced them to buy organic water for $40. Falling for the classic it's keep you feeling young and take away all the back pain. They missed out on Tuesday senior discounts, missed every buy one get one sale, threw out receipts with 50 dollar off coupons on the back, and bought things that wouldn't even work with our electric stove. By the end of the month, my parents had spent $2,500 on groceries just for the two of them. Half of them rotting away because they didn't know what.

I froze with my sandwich halfway to my mouth. What video? The entire table went silent. Six pairs of eyes suddenly finding their lunch trays. Fascinating. Gwen's cheeks flushed red as she stammered. I thought you knew. Never mind, it's nothing. But it wasn't nothing. Behind me, I heard muffled laughter and some when whisper my last name followed by more snickering. Gwen, what video? I pressed. My voice rising slightly. She shook her head vigorously, gathering her things with shaking hands. I shouldn't have said anything. Maybe you should go home. I saw a group of juniors behind us pointing their cameras at me and laughing and my heart sank. Whatever this video was, it had to be serious enough for so many people to laugh at me and for my best friend to look nervous. I immediately pulled out my phone and tried to call my parents, but my battery was dead. That's when the bell rang, leaving me no choice but to return to class. Walking into class was like walking into a circus. The second I stepped through the door, the entire room erupted. Not just giggles or whispers, full uncontrollable laughter. Someone in the back row was making this weird motion with their arms like something falling or tumbling down. And the kids around him were practically crying from laughing so hard. Yo, she's actually here. Someone and shouted and more laughter exploded. I stood frozen in the doorway, my face burning. What the hell was so funny? What was in that video? The teacher looked up from his desk and the look on his face made my stomach drop. It wasn't anger at the disruption, but rather pity. Pure, unmistakable pity, like the way people look at you at a funeral. He spoke softly. Walk.

My three older brothers called it babysitting when I moved in with our grandmother after her kidneys failed two years ago. They drop by monthly to pat themselves on the back for letting me live rent free while I supposedly watch T V. All day. During visits, they'd explain dialysis like I was five, even though I've been running her home treatments myself for 18 months. They ambushed me last summer as all three showed up with nursing home pamphlets and a social worker they'd already hired. They gathered in Grandma's living room while she's that. Looking pale from the treatment I just finished, my oldest brother cleared his throat and launched into what was clearly a rehearsed speech. We all need to accept that grandma requires professional care now, and you need to stop hiding from real life and get an actual job. The social worker nodded along, while my middle brother explained that kidney failure required actual medical knowledge, not just good intentions. Playing nurse and driving her to the dialysis center three times a week isn't a lifeline, my youngest brother added while sorting through brochures. Medicare covers places where real nurses monitor patients instead of playing video games and hoping nothing goes wrong. I tried to explain what I actually did, but he cut me off. We see the insurance claims for Monday, Wednesday, Friday treatments, he said slowly, like I might not understand. She needs Round the clock medical care, not just someone making SAM, which is. And tucking her in at night. They didn't know the spare bedroom had become a sterile medical suite where I performed her dialysis myself every morning at 5. I calculated fluid removal rates based on ankle swelling only. I could read the insurance statements. They've been seen and clearly said home hemodialysis. But they assumed it was a billing code for the center since they couldn't imagine I was actually doing it myself. The machine runs itself anyway. My oldest brother told the social worker, you just connect tubes and watch Netflix for four hours. The social worker started explaining admission procedures. When grandma's breathing changed in that specific way, that meant she had

So I made his life a living hell. We moved into our house three years ago, and everything was perfect until Logan moved in next door six months later. He's maybe 35, works from home doing something with cryptocurrency, and has way too much time to monitor everyone else's business. He installed security cameras pointing directly at our property line. Then he put up those ridiculous private property, no trespassing signs every five feet along his fence. The guy even painted his grass with some kind of spray to make it look more green, which was weird, but whatever. My daughter Zoe plays in our backyard all the time. She's eight, loves soccer, and kicks the ball around for hours. Our yards are separated by one of those low, decorative fences, maybe two feet high. And sometimes her ball goes over like any normal kid. She'd hop over, grab it, and hop back. Takes literally 10 seconds. Last Tuesday, Zoe was playing when her ball went over Logan's fence. She hopped over to get it, and I watched from the kitchen window as Logan came storming out of his house. He started screaming at her. I could hear him yelling about property rights and respect for boundaries at an eight year old. I ran outside and told Logan to back off Zoe. He was crying and ran inside. I explained that kids sometimes chase balls. It's not a big deal, and Asked him to not yell at my daughter. Logan got up in my face and said, your little brat needs to learn boundaries. This is my property, and I don't want her stepping foot on it ever again. I told him she was just getting her ball and would be more careful, but he wasn't having it. Then yesterday came, so he was playing again when her ball went over. She looked at me through the window, and I nodded. It's a ball, for crying out loud. She hopped over, grabbed it, and started hopping back. That's when Logan appeared with his phone already dialing. I couldn't believe it. I ran outside as Zoe came back, confused and scared because this grown man was on the phone with the police about her. 20 minutes later, a police car pulled up. The officer got out, looking like he'd rather be literal.

Jessica arbeitete in einem Friseursalon, verdiente aber kaum genug. mit der Zeit fiel Mir ihre Einstellung auf. sie sagte nie danke, kritisierte nur unser Leben. wenn wir 1 Auto kauften, sagte sie, wir w√ºrden angeben. wenn wir Isabella in den Urlaub mitnahmen, beschwerte sie sich, dass manche von uns nicht so viel Gl√ºck haben. Isabella, meine Tochter war schon immer s√º√ü mit langen gl√§nzenden braunen Haaren. manchmal Kam sie nach Hause und sagte, Tante Jessica hat mich geschimpft oder Tante Jessica sagte, Mein Kleid w√§re h√§sslich. diese Kommentare st√∂rten mich. alles √§nderte sich an einem Samstag. Isabella war zu einer Geburtstagsfeier eingeladen und wollte wie eine Prinzessin aussehen. ich beschloss sie zu Jessica f√ºr einen besonderen Haarschnitt zu bringen. ich rief an und sagte, lass Isabella wie eine Prinzessin aussehen, ich lasse extra Geld da. Jessica antwortete trocken, okay, lass sie bei Mir, aber komm nicht zu sp√§t. ich brachte Isabella zu Jessicas Haus. Isabella war gl√ºcklich in ihrem Rosa Kleid und glitzernden Schuhen. ich k√ºsste ihre Stirn und sagte, ich w√§re in 1 paar Stunden zur√ºck. als ich um 17 Uhr zur√ºck Kam, h√∂rte ich Herz zerrei√üendes weinen. als ich n√§her Kam, h√∂rte ich Jessica schreien, jetzt siehst du Aus wie der Versager deines Vaters.

I was the top performing project manager at a midsize tech firm that loved to pretend it was a startup. We had ping pong tables, standing desks, an H R. Manager who said things like, we're a family right before firing half the team over zoom. I wasn't flashy, I wasn't political. I was just good. Deadlines got hit, teams ran smooth, and clients liked me because I didn't talk to them like I was pitching a TED talk. I had my own office keycard, access my name on internal emails as a go to guy.

I asked him one day as he wandered around the bullpen looking lost. Nah, he said, having gum. Just getting the vibe. Right. The vibe. By month two, he was listed as strategic initiatives consultant, which basically meant we made up a job to justify his salary. And then came the knife. There was a major product launch, one I'd spent six months prepping with two cross functional teams. Brandon tagged along to one planning meeting, said exactly three things, all incorrect, and somehow walked out as co lead on the project two days later. I was

But she's been buried for 11 years. The humming started three weeks ago. I woke up at exactly 4:00am to the sound of my mother's favorite lullaby. Drifting up from the kitchen, half asleep, I almost called out to her before remembering she'd been dead for 11 years. The first night, I convinced myself it was a dream. The second night, I noticed the time again, 4:00am. The third night, same thing. Always that same lullaby she used to hum while making breakfast. Always from the kitchen, always at 4:19. On the fourth night, I set my phone to record. At 4:19, the humming began. When I played it back the next morning, my blood went cold. There it was, faint but unmistakable. My mother's voice humming you are my Sunshine. I still had an old voicemail from her saved on my phone from two weeks before she died. She'd called to remind me about dinner plans, and at the end, she'd hummed a few bars while looking for her keys. I compared the recordings. The pitch, the rhythm, the slight rasp she developed from years of smoking. Identical. That morning, I found things moved in the kitchen. Kettle was on the stove instead of the counter where I always left it. A spoon lay next to the sink, still wet. One chair was pulled out from the table at her usual spot. I started sleeping downstairs on The couch, to be closer to the kitchen. Every night at 4:19, the humming would begin. Sometimes it lasted 30 seconds, sometimes five minutes. I'd lie there paralyzed, unable to move, just listening to my dead mother's voice filling the darkness. After a week of this, I drove to Riverside Cemetery. Mom's grave looked normal at first, but when I knelt down, I noticed the grass seemed looser than the surrounding plots. The dirt beneath looked recently disturbed, like something had pushed up from below and been hastily covered. I called the cemetery office. They had no record of any maintenance on that plot that night. I decided to wait in the kitchen. I set up my phone on the counter to record and sat at the table in complete darkness. At 4:18, I watched the clock on the microwave, my heart pounding. 4:19. The humming started immediately. But this time it was different. It wasn't coming from some vague direction. It was right behind me. My mother's voice, clear as if she was standing over my shoulder, humming our song. I couldn't move, every muscle locked in terror.

I came into the emergency room clutching my abdomen. In the same hospital I once worked as chief of surgery. After two hours, I finally got to see Doctor Harm, who barely glanced up at me and sighed like I'd interrupted something by being here. Let me guess, he said before I could speak. You're 90 years old, ate dinner too late, and now you're panicking. On a scale of one to 10, how bad is your imaginary emergency? When I said eight, he actually laughed. Right. Everyone says eight. Real pain doesn't let you walk in here in your pajamas looking so put together. My pajamas were soaked with sweat from the pain. When did you last have your period? He asked with a smirk. When I said I was postmenopausal, he nodded like he'd solved everything. There you go. Hormones. They make women your age think every little cramp is a heart attack or appendicitis. Have you tried yoga? Maybe losing some weight? He typed something without examining me. I see a lot of hysterical women your age. Retirement gives you too much time to obsess over every little ache. I tried to explain that I knew my body, but he interrupted, ma'am, I have actual emergencies to deal with. Young man next door got stabbed. That's real medicine. Your psychosomatic belly ache can be handled by your GP on Monday. He started to leave, but I grabbed the rails. Of the bed, please. Something's wrong. I can feel it. He pried my fingers off one by one. This is drug seeking behavior. Are you here for pain pills? Because that's not happening. A nurse came in and harm told her loudly. Just anxiety. Probably wants attention. Her husband probably doesn't listen to her anymore, so she comes here for someone to talk to. He didn't know. My husband died two years ago in this very hospital. Don't waste resources on blood work. Give her some antacids and discharge papers. The nurse looked uncertain, but he snapped. Did I stutter, or do you want to be a doctor now, too? When I asked for a different doctor, he got nastier. You want a doctor shop? Classic drug seeking. I'm noting this in your file. He pulled up my chart on the computer. Oh, look, you've been here before.

I was sitting in Mister Kelton's history class. Just another boring Tuesday afternoon. We were learning about World War 2 when the intercom crackled to life. Lockdown! This is not a drill. Everyone froze, like, dead silent. The kind of quiet that makes your ears ring. Mister Kelton, who was the substitute we'd never seen before, went completely white. His hands started shaking as he grabbed the door handle. Everyone under your desks, now! His voice was different. Serious in a way that made my stomach drop. Most of us had done lockdown drills before. You hide, stay quiet. Wait for the all clear. But Mister Kelton wasn't following the script. He started dragging desks across the room, shoving them against the door like his life depended on it. The scraping sound was so loud, I was sure whoever was out there would hear us. Sir, you're supposed to just lock the door, whispered Jessica from under her desk. Ignored her completely. Next thing I know, he's reaching up and unscrewing the light bulbs with his bare hands. The classroom went dim. Just emergency lighting from the hallway. Creeping under the door. Light gives away position, he muttered to himself, like he was talking to someone we couldn't see. Then he took off his belt, not to hit anyone, but to wrap it around the door handle and tie it to something. His hands moved like he'd done this a thousand times before. Fast, precise. No wasted motion. My friend Tyler's phone buzzed once. Mr. Kelton spun around so fast, I thought he was gonna fall over. Phone. Give it to me now. Tyler looked confused, but, sir, it might be my mom checking if I'm okay. Sound gives you away. Silence is survival. He snatched the phone and powered it off. Anyone else? We all shook our heads real quick. Good. Now shoes off, all of you. What? That was Emma sitting two rows over. Shoes off. Footsteps travel through floors. They can track movement.

My 1 0 year old daughter, Lily kept tattling on her younger brother constantly. Every five minutes it was Mom, Tommy touched my stuff! Or Mom, Tommy looked at me weird or Mom, Tommy breathed too loud during my show. I was losing my mind with the constant interruptions throughout every single day. The breaking point came during an important work call when Lily burst into my office screaming that Tommy had walked past her bedroom door without asking permission. Mission first. My boss and three clients heard the entire meltdown through my unmuted microphone. I was absolutely mortified and knew something had to change, so I implemented a tattling tax system. Every time she tattle on Tommy for something minor or petty, she owed me 25 cents from her weekly allowance money. Only real emergencies were free, like if someone was actually hurt, breaking something valuable, or doing something genuinely dangerous that required intervention. I spent an entire evening explaining the system carefully to both kids, creating specific examples of what counted as tattling versus legitimate concerns that needed my attention. Lily seemed to understand the rules perfectly and even nodded enthusiastically when I said this would help her think before complaining. Tommy just looked absolutely relieved that his sister might finally leave him alone. Battling stopped immediately and completely. For two absolutely blissful weeks, our house was perfectly quiet. No constant complaints echoing through every room. No sibling drama. Interrupting my work calls or peaceful evenings. I could actually focus on important tasks without being summoned every few minutes to referee microscopic disputes. Tommy seemed genuinely happier during this peaceful period, playing freely in common areas without his sister monitoring his every single move like a tiny surveillance officer.

Sie hat dort in der vergangenheit geparkt und ich habe es durchgehen lassen, weil ich keinen √§rger mit meinen nachbarn wollte. Aber heute Kam die polizei und sie hat ihnen tats√§chlich 1 video gezeigt, dass sie heute morgen aufgenommen hat. 1 polizist und ich haben privat gelacht, als er Mir sagte wie l√§cherlich sie ist. Dann bemerkte ich, dass ihr auto auf meinem platz stand. Ihr auto wurde gerade abgeschleppt. Tom, ich bin schwanger, nein, was meinst du mit? Nein, ich.

My nine year old daughter came home crying because her science teacher told her she was lying about her dad being an astronaut. My daughter, Sarah had always been proud that I worked for NASA. Every show and tell, she'd bring my old space gloves or mission patches. Classmates loved hearing stories about how astronauts eat and sleep in space. But then Mrs. Thompson joined the school as the new science teacher. During a lesson about space, Sarah raised her hand and shared how I had been on three missions to the International Space Station. Missus Thompson stopped the lesson and called her a liar in front of everyone. Your father can't be an astronaut, she said. NASA doesn't have any active missions right now. They stopped sending people to space years ago. Sarah tried to explain that I worked with both NASA and Space X, but Missus Thompson cut her off. Then next day, Missus Thompson made Sarah stand in front of the class and apologize for making up stories. She even sent Sarah to the principal's office for spreading lies. When my daughter started crying and insisted she was telling the truth, Sarah came home devastated. He showed me the F grade. Missus Thompson gave her space project with a note saying, stop making up stories about NASA. My daughter had spent weeks on that project using real photos from my missions and actual NASA Data I was furious. I emailed Missus Thompson explaining who I was and attached my NASA credentials. She replied saying those could easily be faked, and threatened to report me for encouraging my daughter to lie.

He even knew I always bought strawberry Pop Tarts from the vending machine after class. Your dad sent me to get you to the hospital, he said, showing me his phone with what looks like a text from Dad's number. My hands were shaking, but I got in his beat up Honda Civic. He didn't drive toward the hospital. Instead, he got on Highway 52, going the opposite direction. When I asked where we were going, he pressed the door locks and said, change of plans, kiddo. I watched him throw my backpack out the window about 10 minutes later, including my phone. My stomach dropped when I realized what was happening. We drove for two hours. He kept the radio on some country station and occasionally offered me beef jerky from a bag on his dashboard. He wasn't mean or scary like the kidnapper movies I'd seen. He just seemed lonely and kept talking about how his daughter would have been my age if she hadn't moved away with his ex wife. Finally, he stopped at a shell station near some tiny town I'd never heard of. Bathroom break, he said, walking me inside while keeping his hand on my shoulder. The women's restroom was small and dingy. The Broken mirror and a trash can overflowing with paper towels. That's when I saw it. Taped to the back of the door was this faded poster about human trafficking. At the bottom it said, if. If you're in danger, leave a note where someone will find it. I didn't have paper, but in my jacket pocket was the receipt from the art supply store where I bought paint brushes earlier. Using a stubby pencil from the same pocket, I wrote, help kidnapped in gray Honda. Please call police. I folded it tight and dropped it behind the trash bin.

This couple comes in, Mark and Julia. And Mark is just losing his mind with excitement. Guys taking selfies in the hallway, calling everyone he knows, posting on Instagram about becoming a dad. Julia seemed happy, too, but there was something off about her energy. She kept checking her phone and seemed jumpy whenever Mark got too loud with his celebrating. The delivery went smooth. Healthy baby boy. Everything normal. Mark's crying happy tears. Julia's exhausted but smiling. And I'm thinking, this is one of those perfect family moments you live for in this job. Mark immediately starts calling the baby my little champion won't stop talking about how he's gonna teach him to play baseball and fix cars. So here's where it gets messy. We do routine blood work on all newborns. Standard stuff. When the results came back, I had to double check them because something didn't add up. The baby had a B blood type. Mark was type O. Julia was type A. Now, I. I'm not a genetics expert, but I know enough to know this was basically impossible. Type O and type A parents can't have an A B baby. I rechecked Mark's records from his previous visits. Definitely type O. Confirmed multiple times. I even had the lab run the baby's blood again. Same result. My stomach started doing flips because I knew what this Meant, but I hoped maybe there was some mix up. When I handed Julia the standard paperwork that included the blood work results, her face went completely white. Like, scary white. She. I grabbed the paper, crumpled it up real quick, and shoved it in her purse. Then she grabbed my arm and whispered, please don't tell Mark about this. The desperation in her voice was intense. I had to keep working, but I couldn't stop thinking about it.

I was working my usual shift at Miller's Market. Just me and the evening customers. The man looked normal enough. Mid 40s, baseball cap, friendly smile. He was with a girl who couldn't have been older than 16. She wore an oversized hoodie with the hood pulled up, sleeves covering her hands completely. Something about her posture made my stomach twist. Evening, the man said cheerfully, grabbing a bag of chips and a Mountain Dew from the cooler. Beautiful night, isn't it? The girl stayed silent beside him, staring at the floor. Her shoulders were hunched inward, like she was trying to disappear. When he called her sweetie and told her to grab some candy, it sounded wrong, too forced, too careful. I rang up their items, keeping my expression neutral while my brain screamed that something was off. The girl's face was pale, almost gray, dark circles under her eyes. She looked exhausted in a way that went deeper than just being tired. That'll be 7:50, I said, extending the receipt toward the man. He reached for it, but the girl stepped forward. Can I have it? She asked quietly. Her voice was barely above a whisper. The man's jaw tightened for just a second before his smile returned. Of course, honey. As I handed her the receipt, she pulled back her sleeve slightly. That's when I saw it. Her hand was positioned strangely, fingers curled, thumb tucked underneath. Then quick, As lightning, she closed her fingers over her thumb in a subtle motion. My heart stopped. I'd seen that exact gesture on TikTok months ago, the silent signal for help, the one that was supposed to save lives. I kept my face blank, nodding as if nothing happened. Have a good night, I managed to say. The man hurried her toward the door, his hand on her lower back, guiding her movements through the window.

Sometimes my hands would tremble slightly when writing. Nothing dramatic, just enough to make me wonder. Grandmother had died from early onset alzheimer's when she was just 48. My mother at 52. I was 19 when I watched my mom forget my name for the first time. The geneticist told me I had a 50% chance of carrying the same gene mutation. I take a test and know for certain. But I refused. What was the point of knowing my expiration date? So I lived in fear. Every forgotten appointment or misplaced key became evidence of my inevitable decline. I stopped dating entirely. I'd seen what this disease does to partners. I abandoned my law school dreams. Instead, I took a mindless job where mistakes wouldn't matter. I lived frugally, saving for care I'd need someday. My friends drifted away as I didn't go anywhere and didn't try to live a life. By 30, I was essentially just waiting to die. Then came the day I knocked over my beer with food, and something in me just broke. I lost it, screamed at myself and just kept screaming. My neighbor heard and called 9 1 1. The knock came.

I was 9 when my mom left me at Walmart. Not by accident. She literally told me to sit on the bench by the entrance and wait while she went to get stuff from her car. I waited three hours. A store worker named Beth found me there when the sun was going down. She had this worried look and asked where my parents were. I told her my mom said she'd be right back. Beth called security, then the cops. My mom showed up 20 minutes after the police arrived. No panic, no tears, just annoyed that I made a scene. She told the officer she forgot I was there because she had errands to run, like I was a grocery bag she left behind. The cop looked at her weird and asked how you forget your kid. Mom just shrugged and said, kids are supposed to stay where you put them. That wasn't even the worst part. Two weeks later, she did it again at the mall. This time I waited four hours until mall security found me asleep on a food court chair. When mom finally came back, she was carrying shopping bags from stores that weren't even in that mall. She'd literally gone somewhere else entirely. The security guy was pissed. He asked if this happened before, and I told him about Walmart. His face went red, and he made my mom sit there while he Called someone. I don't know who. But afterward, mom was really quiet on the drive home. At home, dad was watching T V. Like nothing happened. When I told him what happened, he just said, your mother's got a lot on her mind. Like that explained leaving your kid places. Third time, I was ready. We went to target, and mom pulled the same move. But this time, I followed her to the parking lot and watched her drive away. I went back inside and found the customer service desk myself. The lady there was super nice. Her name was Carol, and she gave me a juice box while we waited. When mom came back two hours later, Carol wasn't having it. She asked mom what kind of emergency keeps happening that makes her forget her child. Mom couldn't answer because there was no emergency. She was just selfish. Carol wrote down

My mother in law literally called Child Protective Services on us. I'm not even joking. So my son Oliver was born two months early and had to stay in the NICU for five weeks. It was the scariest time of our lives. David and I were there every single day, sleeping in uncomfortable chairs, learning how to change tiny diapers through incubator holes. My mom Deborah visited almost daily, too, but she wasn't there to help. She was pissed. Like, furious pissed. Why? Because I didn't let her in the delivery room when Oliver was born. I chose David, obviously, and my sister Emma. That's it. The room was already crowded with all the medical staff rushing around because of the emergency, but Deborah took this as some personal attack. She kept saying things like, I gave birth to you, I should be there, and I'm being robbed of my grandmother moment. Lady, your grandson was fighting for his life, and you're worried about photo ops? The whole time Oliver was in the NICU, she'd make these passive aggressive comments. Well, if I had been there from the beginning, maybe things would have gone differently. What does that even mean? Like my choice of delivery room guests caused premature labor? When Oliver finally came home, we were exhausted, but happy. David had taken two weeks off work, and we were figuring out this whole parenting thing. Oliver needed to eat every two hours, even at night. Our apartment looked like a baby supply store. Exploded bottles everywhere, burp cloths on every surface. About a month after we brought Oliver home, someone knocked on our door at 10:00am. I was still in my pajamas because I've been up since 4:00am with feedings. This woman shows her badge and says she's with Child Protective Services. My heart literally stopped. She said they received an anonymous report about child neglect. Someone

Personal assistant after three years together? My stomach dropped. I stood there holding the coffee. I just made her, listening to her laugh with whoever was on the other end. He's actually pretty good at it. Cause all the grocery shopping, meal planning keeps the place spotless. I just focus on work and let him handle the domestic stuff. Honestly, every successful woman needs someone like that. When she hung up, I walked in casually. Who is that? Just my boss, Steven. She shrugged, not looking up from her laptop. I was telling him about my living situation. You mean our relationship? She finally looked at me and laughed. Come on, Ryan, let's be realistic here. I'm a pharmaceutical sales director making six figure years traveling to conferences, managing a team. You're a freelance graphic designer working from our couch in sweatpants. This arrangement works because you handle all the household stuff. Arrangement. Three years reduced to a business transaction. What if I stopped handling the household stuff? She turned back to her screen. Then I'd find someone who would. Look, you're good. At this domestic thing. Why complicated? That hit like a slap. Because I thought I was your boyfriend, not your employee. You're being dramatic. We both contribute what we're good at. I bring in the real money. You make sure I can focus on my career. That night, I made a decision. I went on strike. No cooking, no cleaning, no grocery shopping, no laundry. I ordered Chinese takeout for myself and left her to figure out dinner. Where's my food? She asked. See me eating lo main in the kitchen. There's bread and peanut butter. Day two. Why is there no milk for my coffee? Because no one went grocery shopping. Day 3. Do we have any clean towels? Check the laundry room. Spoiler alert. We don't by day.

My ex wife, Amanda, and I split up seven years ago. We have two boys, Austin and Blake, who are 8 and 9. She got remarried two years back to this guy named Craig, who brought his own kids into the mix. Everything was fine until Craig decided he was suddenly the boss of my household. Five months after their wedding, I get this email from Craig with a list of foods my kids supposedly can't eat anymore. Peanut butter, eggs, cheese, strawberries, and chocolate. He said his daughter has allergies, and hearing about what my boys eat at my place was making her sick. Just thinking about it. Like, what kind of logic is that? Greg wrote that anyone entering their home needs to follow his rules. That means I had to cut all those foods from my kids diet during their week with me. The guy literally tried to control what happens in my own kitchen. At first I thought it was some kind of joke, but then Austin came home and told me Craig made him wash his mouth out with mouthwash because he smelled peanut butter on his breath. Blake said Craig inspected their lunch boxes every day like some kind of food detective. When I didn't respond to his first email, Craig sent another one calling me irresponsible and childish. He Said I was putting his daughter's life at risk because I refused to follow simple instructions. Then Amanda got involved and tried to drag me to court to make it part of our custody agreement. The judge basically laughed them out of the courtroom. She told them they had zero right to dictate what I feed my kids in my own home. Craig wasn't even legally related to my boys. But instead of accepting the ruling, they doubled down.

Last night I realized it's a real murder that happens tomorrow. And he's the killer. For three years, every single night, my eight year old son, Ethan has insisted on the exact same bedtime story. Not from a book. He wants me to tell it from memory. If I change even one word, he screams until I start over. Tell me about the red door house, he always says. So I tell him. Once there was a yellow house with a red door at 47 Maple street. Inside lived Mrs. Carpenter, who made cookies every Sunday. She had three cats, muffin, buttons and snowball. One night, a little boy knocked on her red door exactly seven times. The story continues the same way. Every time. The boy asks for water, Mrs. Carpenter lets him in. He goes to her kitchen, takes a knife from the third drawer, and does something I always describe vaguely as a bad thing that made Mrs. Carpenter go to sleep forever. Then he leaves through the back door, counts to 100, and goes home. I thought I made it up. Some half asleep nonsense I created three years ago when Ethan wouldn't stop crying. But he latched onto it, demanding it word for word every night. Last night, after I finished the story, Ethan asked something new. Daddy, is 47 Maple street far from here? There is no 47 Maple street. But it's Just a story. Yes, there is. I looked it up on your phone. It's only six blocks away. My blood went cold. I grabbed my phone and searched. He was right. 47 Maple street existed six blocks from our house. A yellow house with a red door, according to the real estate listing owner, Dorothy Carpenter. I stayed up all night researching. Dorothy Carpenter was 73, lived alone, had three cats. According to her Facebook, the cat. Cats names made me drop my phone. Muffin buttons and snowball. This morning, I drove past her house. Yellow with a red door, exactly as I've been describing for three years. But I've never seen it before. We moved here only three years ago, and I never go that route. I called in sick to work and spent the day trying to rationalize this. Maybe I'd seen it subconsciously. Maybe Ethan had heard about it somewhere. But then I found something that destroyed any rational explanation. In my closet, buried in a box of old papers, I found a journal. I didn't remember keeping my handwriting, but I had no memory of writing it. The first entry was dated four years ago.

He'd sit in my office staring at his hands like they belonged to someone else. First session, he told me about these dreams he kept having. Blood everywhere, running through dark streets, a woman screaming his name. But he swore he didn't know any women except his landlord. I thought P T S D. Maybe. Trauma does weird things to memory. So I did what I always do. Asked questions, took notes, stayed professional. Sessions two and three, same thing. Jacob would shake, talking about these dreams. Said he'd wake up in cold sweats, afraid of what his hands might have done. I figured it was survivors guilt from the accident. Then session four happened. Jacob walked in with a bloody napkin wrapped around his knuckles. That he'd punched a wall but couldn't remember why. Just woke up that morning with scraped knuckles and this feeling like he'd done something terrible. That same morning, I'd seen the news. Woman named Beth Torres went missing from Maple Street, three blocks from Jacob's apartment. The photo they showed looked exactly like the woman Jacob described from his dreams. Dark hair, small scar on her chin. Even wore The same Red Jacket. I kept my cool. Asked Jacob to describe his dream again. He mentioned details I hadn't heard before. Said the woman always carried this pink lighter, had a butterfly tattoo on her wrist, drove a white Honda. Here's the thing. None of those details had been in the news report.

My ex husband, Jake, had this perfect plan mapped out. He'd work his fancy job while I stayed home with Mia. Since she was born seven years later, I barely remembered who I was before diapers and goldfish crackers. When Jake came home that Tuesday night, he didn't even sit down. Just stood by the kitchen counter, still in his work clothes, and said he wanted a divorce. No warning, no fight beforehand, nothing. He said he'd been thinking about it for months. I felt like someone punched me in the stomach. But then he kept talking. He said since I didn't have a job or income, he figured I'd want him to take me a most of the time. You know, so she could have stability. He even had this whole speech ready about how I could see her every other weekend and Wednesday nights. That's when it clicked. He planned this whole thing while I was home making lunches and helping with homework. He was probably talking to lawyers, making sure everything worked out perfect for him. I asked him if he met someone else. He got all defensive and said it wasn't about that. But he wouldn't look at me when he said it. Just kept staring at his phone. The next few weeks were hell. Jake moved into his brother's spare room, but still came by every morning to help Mia get Ready for school, acting like nothing changed. Meanwhile, I'm googling divorce lawyers at 2:00am and crying in the target parking lot. My mom kept calling, saying I needed to fight for custody, that any good mother would. But here's what nobody understood. I was exhausted. Not just tired. Completely burnt out. Seven years of being the only parent who knew where the Band Aid drawer was or what Mia's teacher's name was.

First month was perfect. I'm living my best life, ordering takeout every night, having friends over. But then stuff started getting weird. Like, really weird. I'd wake up and swear the curtain had moved just slightly, like someone brushed past it. But there's no draft, no AC vent, nothing. I laughed it off. Old building, probably just settling or whatever. Then my food started disappearing. I'd buy a week's worth of groceries, and by Wednesday, half of it would be gone. I figured maybe I was stress eating and forgetting about it. College does that to you. But my cat Bailey started acting super strange. This cat is chill as hell, sleeps 20 hours a day, but suddenly she's hissing at that curtain every single night. Standing there with her back arched, fur standing up, just staring at it like something's behind there. One night, I'm brushing my teeth, and I see the curtain move in the mirror. Not like a little flutter. It moved like someone pushed it from behind. And then Quickly let go. I spit out my toothpaste and ran to check. Nothing there. Just that metal panel bolted to the wall. But I started feeling watched. You know that feeling when someone's staring at you? That was me all the time. In my own place. I'd be watching Netflix and suddenly get this creepy feeling.

My cousin and I both got into nursing school this year at different campuses. We've been competitive since childhood. Our moms are twins and always compared our achievements. Victor has always been the golden child. Straight A's. Student Council VP volunteered at Children's Hospital every weekend for three years. Meanwhile, I maintained B while working as a CNA at a nursing home helping my single mom cover rent. Last December, Professor Wilson handed me a flyer about the Henderson Healthcare Scholarship. $8,000 for nursing students at state schools contributed as 4,000 yearly over two years. Requirements seem straightforward 3.0 GPA, minimum acceptance into health care program, 500 word essay, three references. Deadline January 15th. But buried in fine print, only one person per extended family could receive it annually. Extended family meant anyone sharing grandparents would, which included Victor and me. I immediately knew if we both applied, Victor would win easily. His hospital volunteer work looked infinitely more impressive than my nursing home job helping elderly residents. That evening, Victor called, panicking about financial aid. His parents made too much for need based aid, but nowhere near enough to cover nursing school costs. I'm looking at 20,000 in loans just for first year, he said desperately. There must be scholarships I'm missing. I've searched online, but everything's expired. Tired or I don't qualify. The Henderson Flyer sat on my desk. I almost mentioned it. Three Times during our conversation, Victor started bragging about landing an internship at the hospital, where I've been rejected twice despite my CNA certification. The hiring manager said my volunteer background made me stand out, although Saturday mornings really paid off. You should try volunteering. I like sardonic. Makes your resume pop. His comment stung because he knew I couldn't.

I became a parent at 7 years old, the day I realized my sister Eve would starve if I didn't learn to cook. Our parents worked 18 hour days and treated the office like their real home, while I Learned to pack Eve's lunch in the specific blue container she needed and her sandwiches into perfect triangles. By 9, I could forge their signatures perfectly and knew exactly how to calm her meltdowns. By 16, I scheduled her doctor visits and set alarms to give her medicine on time. Eve would fall asleep by the front door waiting for them to come home, rocking with her weighted blanket. And I'd carry her to bed at midnight, whispering that I'd always be there, even if they weren't. So when Stanford accepted me, I stared at the letter, knowing I couldn't leave her alone for two more years of high school. She caught me crying and grabbed my shoulders. You have to go. I don't like when you're sad, she said, rocking slightly. Parents suddenly appeared when they heard Stanford's name, actually proud for once and lecturing me about opportunities I couldn't pass up. But I told them I couldn't leave Eve alone, not when she needed someone who understood her routines and could advocate for her at school. For the first time in years, they actually look at me, and I watched something break in Mom's face. Oh, god, she whispered. You've been doing our job since second grade. All this time working to afford the best life for you two, and we haven't even been here to live it with you. Dad couldn't look at me when he finally spoke. Starting tomorrow, being here comes first. And for three beautiful months, they became the best parents. Dad Learned Eve's morning routine, mom attended parent teacher conferences, and they both showed up to her sophomore year orientation. Eve called me at Stanford listing every dinner detail they used. The smooth plates. Dad didn't mix her foods. Mom turned the TV volume to 16, not 17. They and photos of themselves at her art showcase. And Eve's smile in those pictures made the homesickness worth it. She even called one night. Very serious.

I was sitting in the ICU painting my granddad's nails when the nurses told me he only had days left to live. My parents died when I was eight, and he was the only family I had. That's when I felt a vibration on my inner thigh. It was a call from my best friend, Bianca. Hey, so what are you wearing to my birthday tomorrow night? Oh, I don't think I'll be able to come. I responded. I felt like a terrible friend for canceling so last minute, but I had no choice. Are you freaking serious right now? What will everyone think when my best friend isn't at my party? You have to come, Bianca. My granddad's dying. I kept it private, my gosh, she interrupted. Now you're making my birthday about you? My parents literally spent $9,000 on party supplies alone. Just admit you're jealous that you're broke and I'm turning 21 first. Luckily, I had AirPods in, so my granddad couldn't hear her BS, and I hung up. She started spamming me with texts that were even worse than her call, but I felt like a petty hoe that day, so I made a group chat of our entire friend group without her and sent every screenshot. Mia called immediately. Babe, I'm so sorry about your granddad. Also, Bianca's cancelled. But listen, I have an idea that's downright evil. Within an hour, my Granddad's hospice waiting room was filled with young girls determined to cheer him up. Girl Mia announced Bianca's birthday party. I want your grandad to be happy. My eyes welled up with tears as I realized every other girl in our friend group felt the same way. I wasn't even mad at Bianca for leaking my secret. That's when Tori jumped in. My mom owns that catering company. She'll donate everything for your grandad's final party. I'll make a Facebook event, said Sienna. Private at first, then public an hour before. Wait, said Jess, showing her phone. Bianca's already posting about her exclusive VIP list. She's bragging about how selective she's being. Perfect. Let's be even more exclusive. Celebrating Harold's beautiful life. Final gathering. The planning was intricate. We created shifts so. And I wouldn't be overwhelmed. I'll coordinate transportation for all his elderly friends. Ashley volunteered. My boyfriend's in a jazz quartet. They'll play for free. Additory. The group chat was fire. Everyone Bianca had invited was asking subtle questions. Not about her, but about my granddad. Hey, did you hear about Okey's granddad? Is it true he raised her alone? Was he really a war

The fifteen thousand dollar graduation trip to Europe I sent for Diego three months ago. The silence was deafening. My mom started fidgeting with her new designer purse, the one that mysteriously appeared last month along with matching shoes. My dad's gold chain suddenly felt heavier around his neck. And I noticed his expensive watch for the first time. We. We thought it would be better if my mom stamp her newly done nails, tapping nervously on the table. If what? Grandma's voice cut like ice.

The kitchen renovation. Dad's new motorcycle sitting in our driveway. They'd stolen my graduation gift and spent it on themselves like it was Christmas morning. My sister Estania, who never worked a day in her life, was wearing earrings that cost more than my monthly gas station salary. Diamond studs that sparkled under the restaurant lights. She. I couldn't even look up from her plate, too busy admiring her fresh manicure. You gave them everything their entire lives, I said quietly, my voice shaking with years of suppressed anger. And they took The one thing meant for me. The one thing I actually earned. Grandma stood up, her chair scraping against the floor loud enough to make nearby diners turn. 20 years I've watched you favor Estania over Diego like he's invisible. I sent that money specifically for him. With a letter explaining every detail of the trip I planned. My mom's face went white as paper. We never got a letter, I swear. Because you threw it away after cashing the check that had his name on it. The restaurant felt silent, despite other diners around us. Even the waiters seemed to sense the drama unfolding at our table. I couldn't hold back anymore. This explains everything. Why you suddenly had money for mom's Botox appointments and weekly spa days. Why dad bought that Harley Davidson he's been wanting for years. Why Estania got her nose job and started posting

I delivered pizza to the same woman every night for three weeks before I finally realized that she was being murdered. She placed the exact same online order at six PM every day like clockwork. Medium pepperoni with extra cheese and one bottle of Coke. And she always included special instructions. That seemed way too personal for a pizza order. While I was trying to deliver smiles and the familiar comfort of a fresh baked pie, I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something horribly wrong in apartment 5D. At first her notes seemed innocent enough, saying things like have a blessed day or stay safe out there, which was actually pretty sweet compared to most customers. After two weeks of these daily deliveries, though, I realized something that made my skin crawl. The first letter of each word spelled out something completely different. One day it said hope everything looks perfect, which spelled help, and I thought maybe I was imagining things. The next day it said hurry up, Robert, terrific service, which spelled H U R T S. And I knew this wasn't a coincidence anymore because my name is actually Jeremy. This woman was trying to tell me something without being able to say it out loud. When I really looked at her for the first time, instead of just going through the motions, she seemed like she was dying in front of Me! Her skin had this grayish tint that reminded me of my grandfather before his kidneys failed and her hands shook so bad she could barely hold the pizza box. The special instructions kept getting more desperate with messages like drivers appreciate your service spelling D A Y S, which confused me until the next one said love every favorite topping spelling left and I realized she was telling me how much time she had. Another said seriously amazing various experiences spelling S A V E and many employees spelling M E. But what really convinced me was when she started writing on the cash tips.

Due to inappropriate use of phones during school hours, all students will be handing them in for first period.

Dr√ºben angekommen merkte ich sofort, das war mehr als nur eine kommode. √úberall kisten, m√∂bel kreuz und quer gestapelt, das ganze haus 1 einziges chaos. Sie war v√∂llig √ºberfordert und entschuldigte sich st√§ndig. Ihre kinder hatten einfach alles abgestellt und waren wieder gefahren. Sie wusste gar nicht wo sie anfangen sollte. Am ende hab ich den ganzen tag dort verbracht, wohnzimmer aufgebaut, k√ºche einger√§umt, sogar bilder aufgeh√§ngt. Sie wollte mich dauernd wegschicken, meinte ich h√§tte schon viel zu viel zeit geopfert. Aber ehrlich gesagt, es hat spa√ü gemacht. Sie erz√§hlte tolle geschichten Aus ihrem leben und machte. Den besten kaffee, den ich je getrunken habe. Am abend bestand sie darauf, pizza zu bestellen. Beim essen fing sie an zu erz√§hlen, warum sie √ºberhaupt hergezogen war. Ihr Mann war vor einem halben jahr gestorben, das alte haus war zu teuer, also musste sie weg. Ihre kinder wohnten weit entfernt, kaum helfen.

I'm 18, and my mom left me alone on my birthday to take her new husband and his kids to Disney World. You're too old for family trips anyway, she said, while packing matching Mickey Mouse shirts for everyone but me. See, my mom remarried when I was 15 to this guy Dave, who came with two bratty kids. From day one, they treated me like an intruder in my own home. The kids got the master bedroom upstairs, while I was banished to the basement. Family game nights. I wasn't invited. Christmas morning, they opened presents while I watched from the kitchen. Mom completely transformed into this new person, desperate to prove she was the perfect stepmom. Every weekend was about Dave's kids. Soccer games, birthday parties, shopping trips. Meanwhile, I worked part time at a grocery store just to buy my own food, because somehow the family grocery budget never included me. But here's the thing. My grandmother left me this house when she passed two years ago. The will was crystal clear. The house goes directly to me. At 18, mom was just supposed to be the temporary caretaker until then. Except she conveniently forgot to mention this little detail to Dave when they got married. I discovered this when I started digging through Grandma's old papers in the attic and found the will. I contacted the lawyer who handled Grandma's estate. Your mother was supposed to inform you about this inheritance when you turned 16, he explained. She's been legally obligated to maintain the property for you, not make major changes without permission.

Look, when I was 12, I wasn't exactly known for making good life decisions. My crowning achievement up until that point was hiding in the bathroom for an entire gym class and convincing everyone I'd been locked in by accident. So when I forgot to do my history homework, my brain naturally went, time for a bold lie. I went with the classic my dog ate my homework. Now, normally, this should have been a quick exchange. Teacher rolls eyes, I get a zero, life moves on. But my teacher, Mrs. Reynolds, was built different. She didn't even blink. She just folded her arms and said, bring me proof. Proof? I froze like I just been caught trying to smuggle a raccoon into an airport. I, I stammered out an okay and sat back down, my heart pounding. Since when do teachers fact check homework excuses all day? I was panicking at lunch. I told my best friend Derek. He immediately said, easy, just have your dog chew it up tonight. Which, yes, is logical. But my actual homework was steam and untouched in my bag. If I use that, she'd know I was lying. So naturally, I went full CIA black Ops mode. Step one, I printed a fresh copy of the homework so there was no trace of my handwriting. Step 2, I covered it in peanut butter. Not a little. I'm talking a thick smear that could Glue a toddler to a wall. Step three. I called in the star of the operation, my dog, Kevin. Now, Kevin is not a small dog. He's a 90 pound golden retriever who thinks paper is just seasoning for whatever food is on it. At first, he sniffed the page suspiciously. Then, chaos. He shredded it, drooled on it, and somehow managed to embed one of his own hairs into the pulp.

Last night I realized it's a real murder that happens tomorrow. And he's the killer. For three years, every single night, my eight year old son, Ethan has insisted on the exact same bedtime story. Not from a book. He wants me to tell it from memory. If I change even one word, he screams until I start over. Tell me about the red door house, he always says. So I tell him. Once there was a yellow house with a red door at 47 Maple street. Inside lived Mrs. Carpenter, who made cookies every Sunday. She had three cats, muffin, buttons and snowball. One night, a little boy knocked on her red door exactly seven times. The story continues the same way. Every time. The boy asks for water, Mrs. Carpenter lets him in. He goes to her kitchen, takes a knife from the third drawer, and does something I always describe vaguely as a bad thing that made Mrs. Carpenter go to sleep forever. Then he leaves through the back door, counts to 100, and goes home. I thought I made it up. Some half asleep nonsense I created three years ago when Ethan wouldn't stop crying. But he latched onto it, demanding it word for word every night. Last night, after I finished the story, Ethan asked something new. Daddy, is 47 Maple street far from here? There is no 47 Maple street. But it's Just a story. Yes, there is. I looked it up on your phone. It's only six blocks away. My blood went cold. I grabbed my phone and searched. He was right. 47 Maple street existed six blocks from our house. A yellow house with a red door, according to the real estate listing owner, Dorothy Carpenter. I stayed up all night researching. Dorothy Carpenter was 73, lived alone, had three cats. According to her Facebook, the cat. Cats names made me drop my phone. Muffin buttons and snowball. This morning, I drove past her house. Yellow with a red door, exactly as I've been describing for three years. But I've never seen it before. We moved here only three years ago, and I never go that route. I called in sick to work and spent the day trying to rationalize this. Maybe I'd seen it subconsciously. Maybe Ethan had heard about it somewhere. But then I found something that destroyed any rational explanation. In my closet, buried in a box of old papers, I found a journal. I didn't remember keeping my handwriting, but I had no memory of writing it. The first entry was dated four years ago, before we

When I woke up, the plane was empty. Flying terrified me. I'd avoided it for 23 years until my sister's wedding in California forced my hand. The airport statistics didn't help. 86 commercial accidents last year, according to the departure board display. My hands shook. Boarding pass to the flight attendant. She had perfect white teeth and that practiced airline smile. Welcome aboard, sir. Seat 14A. Right down the aisle. I found my window seat and tried to calm down. Deep breaths. The cabin filled with passengers, families, business travellers. A crying baby in row six. Normal people doing normal things. Flying was routine for them. During take off, my chest felt like it would cave in from the pressure. When the plane hit turbulence and dropped suddenly, I yelled. A kid behind me giggled before his mom shushed him. My face burned with embarrassment. But after an hour, I started to relax. The flight attendant, her name tag said Rebecca, brought me water and asked if I was okay. First time flying, she said kindly. You're doing great. I watched movies on the screen, played simple games on the remote. The fear faded into boredom. Maybe flying wasn't so terrible after all. Around hour three, they dimmed the cabin lights to blue. Most passengers tried to sleep in the cramped seats. I decided to do the same. Anything to make time pass faster. That's when I heard the whispers. Soft Voices speaking just below the hum of the engines. My drowsy mind couldn't make out the words, but something felt wrong about the rhythm. The cadence was too regular, like chanting. I fell asleep anyway. I woke up to silence. Complete, absolute silence. No engine noise, no air circulation, no passenger sounds. I rubbed my eyes and looked around the cabin. Every seat was empty. Not just empty. They look like nobody had ever sat in them. No blankets, no pillows, no personal items. The overhead bins were closed. Even the baby's car seat was gone. I stumbled into the aisle, my heart hammering. Hello? I called out. Rebecca? Anyone? My voice echoed strangely in the empty space. I checked the bathrooms, the galley, every row of seats. Nothing. I pressed my face to a window and saw we were still flying. Dark sky, stars, the faint outline of clouds far below. I was alone on a plane at 30,000 feet. I ran toward the cockpit, but the cabin just kept going. Row after row of empty seats, all identical. The blue

Now I know why we moved so much when I was a kid. I don't usually celebrate birthdays anymore, but this year my dad surprised me with a package that showed up at my apartment door. Inside was a USB drive with a note in his messy handwriting. Emma's Home Movies, 1995 to 2000. Happy Birthday, sweetheart. I was excited because I barely remembered anything from when I was little. We moved around constantly when I I was a kid, and dad always said it was because of his job in construction, but we never stayed anywhere longer than two years. Most of our old photos got lost during one of the moves. I plugged the drive into my laptop and found dozens of video files organized by year. The quality was terrible, typical 90s camcorder footage. But seeing my younger self was amazing. I watched myself learning to walk, playing in various backyards, blowing out birthday candles in different houses. But something felt off in every video. We seem to be living in really nice houses with expensive furniture and big yards, way nicer than anything a construction worker could afford. I texted my dad asking about it, but he didn't respond. Then I got to the videos from 1997, when I would have been about 4 years old. The first clip showed me playing in a beautiful kitchen with marble countertops, while the woman's voice off camera encouraged Me. But it wasn't my mother's voice. Mom had died when I was two, and dad raised me alone after that. Who's that good girl? The woman said. Emma. Such a good helper. I paused the video. The woman sounded middle aged, kind. Nothing like the babysitter's dad occasionally hired. Watching and saw glimpses of her shadow moving around, but the camera never showed her face. The next video was dated three weeks later. Same kitchen, but now I was sitting at the table, crying, while Dad's voice tried to comfort me from behind the camera. It's okay, sweetheart. The nice lady had to go away. We're going to live somewhere new now. A chill ran down my spine. The timeline was adding up to something horrible. I jumped to 1998. New house, different kitchen, but the same pattern. Another woman's voice talking to me, teaching me to tie my shoes. Emma, you're getting so big. Soon you'll be starting kindergarten. Then three weeks later, the same scenario. Me crying, dad comforting me. Talk about moving again.

He texted me something terrifying before he disappeared. My brother Ethan always loved horror movies. So when Darkwood Entertainment hired him as a creature specialist at their new theme park, I wasn't surprised. The pay was incredible. Three times what he made at his old job. But the contract was weird. No photos allowed, no discussing work details, mandatory on site housing. It's just NDAs and corporate stuff, he told me over the phone after his first week. Monsters here are insane, though, Blake. Like, movie quality realistic. I can't believe they're just costume. He called me every Sunday for two months. Always excited, always raving about how authentic everything looked. Then the calls got shorter. Stranger. Blake, you know how some actors are just naturally gifted? He asked during what would be our last conversation. Like they become the character completely. Some of these guys never break character. Ever. That was three weeks ago. Yesterday. I got a text from his number at 3:00am. They're not costumes. Don't come looking for me. Tell mom I'm sorry. I drove to Darkwood Park immediately. The receptionist, a pale woman with hollow eyes, said Ethan had quit without notice, no forwarding address. When I asked to speak with management, she just stared at me until I left. But I didn't leave. I parked outside the employee housing complex behind the park and waited. At sunset, workers started trickling out. Some looked normal, tired. Carrying backpack, chatting on phones. Others moved differently, mechanical, like they were concentrating on walking upright. One of the normal workers, a girl, maybe 19, approached my car. You're looking for someone, aren't you? She whispered, glancing nervously at the other employees. Her name was Whitney. She worked there four months. Your brother trained me, she said.

Last week, I found out the horrifying reason why. My dad has been feeding people in our basement for as long as I can remember. Every night at exactly 8:47, he would grab the leftover dinner, walk downstairs for 20 minutes, then come back up with an empty plate. I used to think this was completely normal until I realized how messed up it actually was. When I was 6, I asked my mom about the voices coming from downstairs. She just lit another cigarette and said, your father handles the basement handle upstairs. Her hands were shaking the whole time she said it. I could tell she was scared, but I didn't know why. The basement door was always locked with this huge deadbolt. I tried opening it once when I was eight, and my dad caught me. His face went completely white. He told me to never go down there because they weren't ready to meet me yet. But I could hear them. A little girl singing, A baby crying at three in the morning. Christmas was the weirdest time because my dad would bring two sets of presents. One pile for me and another armload that disappeared downstairs. I'd hear kids screaming with excitement while I opened my gifts alone upstairs. Mom would just chain smoke by the window, staring at nothing. When I turned 12, everything changed. The singing stopped. No more laughter, no more voices. Just Complete silence. But dad still brought food down every single night. He'd come back up faster, though, looking sick. Mom started drinking wine for breakfast. Convinced my best friend Trevor to sleep over that weekend. Maybe if someone else was there, dad would finally explain what was going on. But at 8:47, he grabbed the plate like always. Trevor followed me to the basement door. That's when we heard her. A woman's voice, desperate and hollow. Please let us out. Austin's getting older. He'll understand now. We've been good. We've been so good. Trevor's face went completely white. Dude, that's messed up. We should call someone. But dad was already coming back up. He saw us by the door and dropped the plate. It shattered everywhere. Boys, go to Austin's room now! That night, I heard my parents fighting for hours. Mom was sobbing, saying they couldn't keep doing this. Dad kept repeating, they need to stay down there. You know what happens if they don't. The next morning, Trevor's parents

I thought it was cute at first, you know, made me feel like she really thought things through. But Last Saturday, I asked her something that's been eating at me since. Why did you marry me? I was expecting some romantic answer about how much she loves me or how I make her laugh or whatever normal couple stuff. She looked at me dead serious and said, because you asked. I thought she was joking, so I laughed it off, but then I pushed a little more. Okay, but, like, what made you say yes, though? And this woman, my wife of three years, looks me straight in the eye and says, because I trust your judgment. I just stared at her. What the hell does that even mean? So I asked her to explain, and she went into full professor mode. She told me love isn't enough to marry someone.

Again? I stared in shock. Again. I don't want to compete. Oh, sweetie, mom said, reaching across the table to pat my hand. The monthly room assignment builds character. Winners get the master suite. Losers get the basement. My younger brother, Marvin, pushed his food around his plate. My sister Bianca wouldn't even look up. We've been doing this for three months since we moved to this house. The basement had exposed pipes. heat. And spiders that dropped from the ceiling at night. Bianca won last month with her debate trophy. Dad continued, pulling out his notebook. So she keeps the room unless one of you beats her achievements this month. The chicken tasted like cardboard in my mouth. This is insane. Other families don't do this. Mom smile tightened. Other families raise weak children. We're raising winners. That night, Bianca came to my basement corner, where I'd hung sheets for privacy. I'm sorry, she whispered. Didn't wanna win, but sleeping down here made me sick last time. It's not your fault, I said, but the words felt hollow. Marvin had already stopped talking to both of us. The next morning, dad posted the point chart on the refrigerator. 10 points for A's, 20 for sports victories, 15 for volunteer hours, even five points for who said good morning first. I watched Marvin set his alarm for 4:00am. Just to beat us to the by week two, Bianca started hiding my homework. I found it crumpled in the trash after getting a zero. Marvin put a dead spider in my backpack during lunch, making me scream in front of everyone. We stopped eating together. Stop helping each other with assignments. Three kids living in the same house, acting like enemies. Look at that competitive spirit! Dad beamed one morning after Marvin and Bianca physically fought over who got to take out the trash for points. Mom took photos like it was something to be proud of. My grades started slipping from the stress. I couldn't sleep in the freezing basement constantly.

I showed them six months of security footage I'd compiled. Margaret taking 47 packages, including my insulin, which she'd thrown away because it looked medical and gross. The officer looked at the bee invoice. Ma'am, she legally ordered live bees for her beekeeping hobby. You illegally opened her mail. That's a federal crime. What beekeeping hobby? I joined an urban beekeeping Group the week before had the membership card and everything. Margaret got charged with mail theft, 47 counts.

He keeps making these comments about how it would be nice to have another boy and asking if I think the baby looks like a boy in the ultrasound pics.

When I asked him what he meant, he got all defensive and said he was just worried about teenage years and dating and stuff, but something felt off. We didn't do a gender reveal with Connor because Jake kept changing his mind about when he wanted to find out. We ended up learning it was a boy like three weeks before I gave birth, and Jake literally cried tears of joy in the doctor's office. So two weeks ago, Jake said maybe I should just go to my appointment alone and find out without him. He said he was too nervous and would rather wait for the party. I thought that was weird, but whatever. I went to Doctor Martinez's office by myself last Tuesday. She did the ultrasound and told me we're having a girl. I was honestly excited.

He hasn't aged a single day. When I started teaching third grade at Rosewood Elementary, I thought I'd seen everything. But nothing prepared me for Ryan. He showed up on the second day of school clutching a class assignment sheet that said, Room 12, Mess Carter. Ryan Blackwood. I didn't remember his name on my roster, but kids get enrolled late all the time. Ryan was 8 years old. Blond hair, green eyes, small scar above his left eyebrow. Quiet kid who always sat in the back corner. Wore the same red hoodie every day. At the end of third grade, Ryan's parents apparently decided he needed to repeat the year. Academic struggles, they said. Weird, because Ryan was one of my brightest students. Fourth year of teaching, same thing. Ryan showed up again, clutching that assignment sheet. Same red hoodie, same corner seat. Still 8 years old. Fifth year, same Ryan. Same assignment sheet, same eight year old face. Sixth year, I started taking photos. Ryan in September looked identical to Ryan from five years ago. Same height, same baby teeth, same everything. Seventh year, I confronted the principal, showed her the photos. That's not the same child, she said. This year's student is Robert Blackwood, Ryan's younger brother. I looked at the photos again. Name on this year's assignment sheet had changed to Robert Blackwood in my hands. Eighth year, was Richard Blackwood. Same face, same scar. Same red hoodie that never faded. Ninth year brought Russell Blackwood. I started documenting everything. Every year, a new Blackwood boy who looked precisely like Ryan from five years ago. But in year 10, something changed. This year's assignment sheet read Ronald Blackwood. But when I looked at his face, his green eyes had no pupils, just solid green, like marbles. His skin had a waxy, artificial texture. During recess, he sat perfectly still for 30 minutes. Didn't move, didn't blink. Other kids played around him like he wasn't there. Ronald, are you okay? I asked. He turned his head toward me with a mechanical click. I'm fine, Miss Carter. His voice sounded hollow, like it was coming from inside a tunnel.

I giggled nervously. Um, yeah, why? No, no, no, no, no, she suddenly screamed while walking as far away from me as possible. I just laughed because moms can be so weird sometimes. But the next day, my daughter came home from school crying. Mommy, Leah said her mom said she can't talk to me anymore. Leah was her best friend. I immediately took out my phone and texted her mom asking if everything was okay. No response. I texted Emily's mom, one of the other girls in her trio. Still nothing. I had just managed to calm my baby girl down when the pizza arrived. Usually our delivery guy is the Apator 5,000. But tonight he just set the box on my doorstep and practically ran away. George, you forgot your tip, I yelled, waving a 20. He just kept going. The next few days were insane. At my daughter's soccer practice, Helen saw me walking towards her and held her phone to her ear. No one had even called her. Helen, what's going on? She mouth, sorry and walked faster. We used to complain about our husbands together. Parents were whispering and showing each other something on their phones. When I walked by, they'd quickly put them away. By Thursday, my daughter was refusing to go to school. They moved my desk away from everyone else. The Teacher said it was for space reasons, but there's like 10 feet between me and Leah now. I tried to bring her to the hairdresser to cheer her up, but when the woman saw me coming, she closed early. No apology. Just flipped the sign and pulled the blinds. My phone buzzed. It was my landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry, rent can wait this month. This was the same man who charged me a 50 dollar inconvenience fee when I paid rent at 12:00am instead of midnight. Then the birthday party, Emily's sleepover. My daughter found out that everyone was invited except her. She was having such a bad panic attack that I had to call a hospital. Mom, what did I do? Emily is my best friend. Enough was enough. I called the school office. Something is happening to my daughter. She's being systematically excluded and I need answers right now. The counselor called back within an hour, but her voice was off like she was choosing every word carefully. Missus Cal, Hannah, we just wanted to check in about your home environment. Is everything safe? Anyone new spending time around your daughter? What? What are you even asking me? I think it's best if we discuss this in person. Can you come in tomorrow morning? No. You'll tell me right now why my daughter is being tortured. Long pause. The principal will explain everything tomorrow. Beep. She hung up. Then at eleven PM, an email from my Gym membership terminated effective immediately. I've been going there for five years. The owner knew me by name. I was trying to figure out what to do when my daughter crawled into my bed at 2:00am sobbing, Mommy, am I ugly? It took everything in me not to burst into tears. The lunch lady wouldn't look at me today. She just pointed at my tray. I finally caved. On Saturday morning, I found myself walking towards the principal's office while being escorted by a security guard. Other parents there for Saturday sports held their kids against the walls as we passed. One mom literally shielded her son with her body like we were dangerous. In his office, the principal locked the door behind us. The click was so loud in the silence, he walked to the windows and twisted the blinds shut. My daughter grabbed my hand tighter. Please sit down. I'll stand. What is this about? He sat at his desk, fingers hovering over his keyboard, then pulled them back. Mister Griffin, you're scaring me. Missus Callahan. He was looking at his screen, not at me. When did you last speak to your ex husband? Christmas. Why? And you haven't been in contact since then? No communication at all? No. We exchange texts about pickup times maybe once a month. What does this have to do with anything? He turned his monitor slightly, then back like he was debating something. Some information has come to our attention about your Former husband, the parents. What information? What are you talking about? I need to show you something, but I want you to prepare yourself. My legs felt weak. I sat down, pulling my daughter onto my lap. It's from two weeks ago. The parents have been. He paused. I've been very concerned. He finally turned the screen toward me. Local news website. The headline hit me first, then his face, my ex husband's face in a mugshot. Full story on channel link below.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her co worker Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. He showed me his Instagram, tall brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem, he didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed. After that first dinner, my mom kept inviting him back. Mr brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball scores, my Dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us, said she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever, you know, that message hit me like a truck. I realised he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting back or Giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favourite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over, set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

Nobody likes a lunch thief and I had one of the most aggressive at my office. There were rumors for a few months leading up to the inciting incident of someone going around and taking people's lunches. Just about every day someone different would complain that their lunch was missing. It even happened to me once or twice. But I figured, hey, it's a big office. A few people are probably just careless and grab the wrong lunch and are too embarrassed to bring it back. Or someone else packs their lunch and they don't know what's in there so it's not obvious they have the wrong one or whatever. Most people just brought brown bags with their names on it anyways or identical rubber made Tupperware with a little piece of label tape on the side. It was easy enough to mix it up. I had accidentally grabbed the wrong lunch once or twice, but I'd noticed before I got it open. I thought I was just more careful or even just not as busy as some other people in the building. However, other people weren't as forgiving and a quorum made complaints to HR. They were blown off. Personally at the time I thought it was all much ado about nothing. But then it began. My wife enrolled in a French cooking class online and just about every day I was Bringing fancy gourmet leftovers in for lunch, you'd think I was picking up a to go bag from a Michelin starred bistro on the way in. Each morning, she really threw herself into the coursework. There were no problems for about two weeks, maybe three, until one day my lunch went missing. Considering what delicacies I had to look forward to, I was pretty miffed. But I did it once over around the break room and didn't see anyone eating my lunch. So figured someone grabbed my bag by accident earlier, saw how good things looked and realizing it was their lucky day, didn't bring it back to the fridge. I wrote the mysterious stranger off as an asshole, but accepted the loss and looked forward to dinner that night instead. Next day, I write my name on my lunch in extra bold lettering, jam the bag into the back of the fridge and feel peace of mind. I get there come break time, nope, it's gone. I was pretty upset, but I figured it was a stroke of bad luck and left it at that. What else could I do? However, on the third day, out of an abundance of caution, I kept my lunch at my desk. A pain because I had to eat it fairly early in the day to avoid spoilage, but at least I'd know where it was. I got up to take care of some business down the hall and when I came back, Yep, my lunch was gone. Unfortunately, that didn't help me narrow it down much at all because my desk is centrally located, so everyone's constantly passing by. At that point, there was no possibility of the theft being arbitrary. So I approached HR and filed a complaint. Their response, practically verbatim was employees lunches are their personal property and the company is not responsible for lost or stolen personal item.

I had an employee who was a strict vegetarian for religious reasons. One day we were discussing the employee salad bar and he mentioned how much he loved the Caesar dressing packets they offered. I was surprised and stupidly blurted out, oh, I didn't realize you ate fish. He responded that he was vegetarian and gave me a quizzical look. I had to explain that the salad dressing contained both fish and Parmesan cheese, which is almost always cultured with animal rennet. He didn't believe me and the next day insisted on reading the ingredients on one of the packets to me to prove to me that I was wrong. Then he got to the anchovies and got quiet, too. My best friend in high school was humongous and would sweat profusely. We would come in after lunch in Texas and he would smell awful. I think he would wear his clothes without washing them after sweating. We had English after and the AC sucked, so the teacher put a fan in the window. He would sit in front of the fan and blow his funk over everyone. The class got together and voted that I should be the one to tell him. Well, I had to break it to him that for the last year, he has smelled horribly. I felt pretty bad, but he never stunk again. 3. I had to tell My friend that the online girlfriend he'd been talking to for months was actually a scammer using stolen photos. He was planning to send her money to come visit. And breaking the news to him was one of the toughest conversations I've ever had. 4. I had a friend ask me about some green sign in the distance. It was in fact a bright orange sign giving off an intense orange light, which sodium vapor is known for. I had to tell him right there that he was colorblind. He was in his mid 30s too. A lot of odd things that had happened in his past fell into place for him that day. Five, I had to tell my mom that my grandma, her mom didn't make it and had been buried a month before. My mom had been in a coma for around six weeks during that time. At one point they were actually in the ICU in beds beside each other. Neither ever knew. So yeah, that sucked. 6. I had an old friend that I lived with at the time. He'd been getting obviously catfished for years, thankfully not monetarily. Just a lonely girl looking for attention over the phone and internet. But he just refused to believe the signs. He claimed to have talked a bunch on the phone and we didn't really believe him. Eventually she asked for money for a ticket and we were all like, there it is. And he finally believed Us. He decided to put it to a test to prove it once and for all and told her that he'd bought her a ticket for the flight, assuming she'd make up an excuse to get out of it. He didn't really buy the ticket. Well, to his surprise, the day of, he got a call from her at the airport panicking because they couldn't find the ticket. He managed to play it off as a mistake and was able to get her on the flight. They dated for 5 years and she came out every summer for like 5 years before they grew apart. So guess I was wrong. Seven, I hate to break it to you, but the hardest moment was telling my best friend that their partner was for the streets. They were so in love and completely blinded by it. And when I broke the news, it shattered their world. It even strained our friendship for a while because sometimes even when you're trying to help, the truth is too painful to accept. 8, an employee confided in me that she contracted the clap and was talking about how she got it from the toilet seat at work because she is monogamous with her husband. I was like, girl, he ain't monogamous with you. 9, my wife telling me that she wants a divorce about 30 minutes ago. I sure hope that I will be okay. Later, it struck me like lightning. 10 when my ex Tried to make me choose between my dog and him.

One, how 24 hour it is. Nobody even blinks when you get up at 3:00am to meet a flight or make a deployment muster. Half the people you know are asleep at three PM their duty next week will probably be different. So you meet friends for cards or a meal at 6:00am or six PM doesn't really matter. Also the different food you eat. After a couple of decades of chow line food, Pan Global, Military Wife Pot locks and TDY and Turd World dumps, you don't even care if you have never seen that dish before in your life or if it's squirming. If the guy next to you isn't deceased, you will probably eat it too. Never leave your Tabasco bottle at home so you can get the bugs too. How non military life on a submarine is. It's already a stressful environment so nobody really wants to pile on top of that. Don't get me wrong, they do their jobs and they do them well. But this straight laced military bearing you see in movies is not really there. My command had to gently remind enlisted types not to refer to the junior officers by their first names. Under way, shaving daily was a luxury. So everyone had some sort of stubble, hair got too long, uniforms, coveralls got torn, stained and just generally jacked up, especially if you worked in the engine room. We all Wore civilian sneakers or slip ons as Navy boots made way too much noise. All that said, if there was a real or simulated emergency, everyone immediately shifted to 100% by the book. Those were some of the finest, most prepared people I've ever worked with. So if you want to see real life on a submarine, watch down. Periscope 3. I found that the idea of a chain of command really messes with the heads of those who never served in the military. 4, dependapotamus. It's something I Learned about a few years ago. Basically, the young guys are desperate to get better housing, so they get married to women who prey on young military men because they get good benefits, health, pension. The women are dependents. The potomus comes from the idea that most of them end up getting gluttonous and slothful, mooching off of their husbands who are away at war and get rather large. It's sad.

Moment one the other day my 18 year old brother in law got married to his high school sweetheart in a parking garage so that they can live off campus at college together. His now wife's mother is an ordained minister. His parents, my in laws were very upset and he couldn't understand why saying it's just a fake marriage for school. Oh no, sweet boy, you are married. I just laughed and laughed. I love him dearly but he's a moron. His wife lost her scholarship because they live off campus and became residents of the state and she no longer qualifies. 2. My dad used to be the typical boomer, always thinking I was just being lazy and not doing things right until he got injured and could no longer work in an industry he had 30+ years of experience and seniority in. It took him several months to get a new job of any kind and was shocked when he realized that he couldn't just negotiate for higher pay. He was fired on the spot when he threatened to organize a strike and was barred from the premises. When he had to move, it baffled him that he couldn't just give the landlord a few hundred bucks and move in right away but had to wait a week for his application to go through and the landlord to do a background check. Probably my Most satisfying one was when he finally decided to get into the industry. I'm in truck driving. He Learned very fast that it wasn't like it is in the movies from the 80s. Truckers don't know nor ever have given a darn about one another. Sure, some are nice to one another, but if it's a choice of you or them, don't hold your breath. Most big trucking companies in the US are only concerned about your safety because it saves them money on lawsuits. After his third trucking job ended with him getting terminated and is now living off my income, he stopped giving me crap about my problems and is still job hunting. 3. There was a young girl I used to work with a target. She was hired for the 6:00am to two thirty PM shift, but she regularly showed up between 8 to 9:00am without any good explanation. After the third time or so, our supervisor asked her if she had something to do in the morning such as getting kids ready for school that required a later shift. If so, she could be moved to the 8:00am to four thirty PM shift. Girl's response was no, I still want to leave at 2:30. I just don't want to get up that early. She was fired when she refused to acknowledge that you cannot make your own schedule. 4. My boss told me about a friend of his who told him they have a life hack She would get her bills in the mail, not pay them, and then wait a couple of months to pay. Then she would cry so the debt collectors would feel bad and waive the fees for not paying on time. That was her brilliant life. Hack. 5, a dude 18 years old in boot camp got a letter from home and I could see he was agitated being 22 and concerned for his well being. I asked him if he wanted to talk about it. I'm thinking a Dear John letter or the mom and dad divorcing letter. He told me that his younger brother got a Mercedes for his birthday and that he was upset because he only got a BMW. Can't remember what I said, but I knew boot camp was gonna do him in. It did. 6, when I was in boot camp, some kid put his letter addressed to mom with no address attached. 7. They did a study and there's a lot of people who have winning the lottery part of their retirement plan. 8. My old roommate was only paying $25 on her credit cards every month, but was putting almost every purchase on them. I felt so bad explaining to her that she was now in credit card debt. 9, girl asks me to do her shift for her. She has a doctor's appointment, okay, on payday, she asked for the money for that shift. Uh, no, it doesn't work that way.

One, 20 years ago I was standing on my back porch lighting up and talking on the phone. This cop comes out of the forest behind the house soaking wet and covered in MUD. He walked right up into my yard and I asked if he needed help. He told me to get my fat ass back into the house or he'd arrest me. I just stood there as that cop walked through my yard and away to wherever he was going. 2, About 35 years ago when I was a teenager, the house was broken into. Detectives thought I did it as an inside job. My dad had me sit down with them for questioning. After laughing at the accusation, I realized they were serious and told them no and clammed up. After I asked why my dad would put me in front of them with no warning that I was a suspect, like did he think it was me? He said, I think it could have been you. I never did anything illegal like that in my life. For him to think that definitely rocked my relationship with him. Three thirty seven years ago, I was five and had spent two years saving up $10 worth of pennies. I used to count them, 10 pennies in a pile. Ten piles is $1. I kept them in an empty coffee ground can. One day the jar was empty and we had Pizza for dinner. She made me thank her boyfriend for the pizza. 4. I was kicked out of a bar spelling B for spelling a word correctly. The word was Lilliputian like from Gulliver's Travels. I spelled it correctly. They had it without the double L. I showed them I was correct and they still wouldn't let me back in the spelling bee. This was like five years ago. I'm still super bitter. 5. In my junior year of high school, my parents purchased a car for me, but I made all the payments by working 20 hours a week at a local pizzeria. One weekend my mom asked me to take her car 10 minutes into town to the car wash and wash it. I got back about an hour later and my car was gone. They had an offer from someone my dad worked with, so they sold it right out from under me. I never got the money from the sale. 6 during the lockdown, I graduated from college. It was a huge deal. I was the first in my family. They did a zoom ceremony and the presenter accidentally skipped over my name. My family was all watching waiting for them to call my name via live stream and of course the presenter never fucking did. It was just as devastating for them as it was for me. I will never forget my mom saying, I don't understand. Our name should have been there. Our name Ours. I was graduating for us.

What's the saddest thing someone ever returned? One, I used to be a manager for a Disney store. We had a regular old man come in with his wife regularly. Super cute couple. I mean, matching outfits, holding hands, just cute as could be. We used to sell these huge stuffed animals, like ginormous. The couple came in about once a week and would just walk around, laugh and smile, buy things here and there. One night he came in on his own and bought one of these gigantic Mickey's we had. It was $300, I think. He was so excited. He told us all about how he was going to take her out to dinner and it would be sitting there on the bed to surprise her when they got home. Anyway, two days later, he walked back in carrying the gigantic Mickey Mouse plush to return it. He had bought it to surprise her for her 75th birthday. She passed away in her sleep the day before her birthday. He thanked us and said goodbye and that he would not be coming back because our store reminded him too much of his wife. We found out he passed away a week later, was just seven days from the day his wife passed. We found out all the details because one of our employees went to the same church they attended. Two customers regularly come in with large amounts of baby supplies, returns. They Get the wrong gender items or duplicates. An older woman came in with a cartload so I asked about the new baby. She slowly and through tears explained that her only child and grandbaby didn't make it during childbirth. 3. Not a return, but I worked in a jewelry store and the saddest sale we ever had was a labor. The guy had this ring on labor for 12 months but passed in a car accident. His parents came in and picked up the ring so his girlfriend could keep it. I don't think she had any idea he was going to propose. 4, I work at a store in a college town and one night some younger guy was returning a keg barrel only was still half full. I jokingly asked the guy if it was a trash party or something along those lines and he responded with, yeah, it was a party for one of our friends who passed the day of the party. Five, I was working at a large pet store in the tropical fish department. One busy weekend a very well dressed, rather snobby woman came in and bought six baby angel fish, each about the size of a dime plus the fins. The store I worked in was inside a huge high end shopping mall so we had a holding service where we would bag up fish, cash the customer out and float the fish in their bags in a warm tank until the Customer was finished all their shopping and was ready to leave for home. As a matter of course, I offered to hold this lady's baby angel fish. She said she was all good and left. Four or five hours later, she stormed back into the store demanding a manager and a refund. She was shaking the bag in our faces for emphasis, yelling that her gorgeous angels were all deceased. On close inspection, we discovered that the silly woman had put the poor fish in her car, presumably so she didn't need to carry them while she shopped for other things or returned to the store to pick them up. Unfortunately, because it was January and the temperature outside was extremely cold, the tiny babies had frozen. 6. A guy was returning baby formula and he was looking pretty down. I asked him how his day was and he said that he has been having a long day and that he's been having a long month too. I thought he just had a baby, so maybe he just got the wrong formula. I asked if he just had a baby and he said he used to have a baby. I told him I was sorry and he said it was okay. There were a few minutes of silence and he said he was a fun little guy, seen a lot of things, but that one broke my heart.

One maybe 22 years ago, I had a phone interview with a baking company. I didn't care to have my peers know what I was up to, so I took the call on my cell phone in my car. The call was crystal clear and no technical issues. At one point, they had mentioned the weather and asked how it was where I was. I told him that I was sitting in my car and I could see that it was actively snowing and what not. The interviewer asked me, are you taking this call on a cell phone? I told him I was. Then he asked me if I thought that was appropriate. I asked him what he meant by that. He said he thought it was kind of rude to take a formal call on a cell phone. I told him I would be more than happy to conclude the interview if talking on a cell phone was an issue. If he was interested, I'd be happy to continue it the next day when I'd be at a desk. He again repeated how rude he thought it was that I had called from a cell phone and that there was no need to continue the interview process. I disagreed with the first point, but did agree with the second. To this day, I wonder what in the world he was talking about and where he was. Coming from too. At my wedding we marked the vegetarian items as vegetarian. This made the one vegetarian in my wedding sister in law who hates me fly into a catatonic rage because we are singling out the vegetarian food as vegetarian and not treating it as normal food. Then how the heck are they supposed to know it's vegetarian? Guess she wanted to be able to ask so then everybody knows they're vegetarian lol. Three. I once listened to my boss try to lecture the fire marshal because he was talking about something being flame retardant. Her reasoning was you should just call it fireproof because retardant was an awful word. It was one of those times where I really should have tried to stop her, but instead I just stood off to the side making a surprise Pikachu face. Four. This guy at a Halloween party I was at was dressed in a giant bacon costume. Some girl was yelling at him for being so offensive toward those who didn't eat bacon. For various reasons. Mind you, she ate pork. One of the guys who didn't eat bacon at the party asked her what the heck she was talking about, but she didn't back down. Lol. I have no idea why people feel they need to go out of their way to be inaccurately offended on behalf of other people. 5. One time someone got offended when I put on my seatbelt. She thought I was commenting on Her ability to drive. The same thing happened to me when inside a taxi, he asked, do you wear your seatbelt when you're with your dad? I said, yes. Six. My seven month old was wearing a shirt that had a rocket ship and the NASA logo. And some middle aged woman in the shop said he shouldn't be wearing that because he's clearly not an astronaut. I was dumbfounded. 7 at school, someone didn't have a calculator and asked if anyone had one they could borrow. Someone offered them a pink calculator and they refused, saying that they were offended. They try and give them something less masculine. Clearly they didn't need a calculator that badly if they're just gonna whine about the color. Eight. I'm a nurse at a children's hospital. I was wearing Mickey Mouse Halloween scrubs, which have little dancing skeletons on it. A visitor for one of my patients complained that I was wearing scary and inappropriate scrubs. Nine. People get very offended that I don't like being touched, and this happened just last week. I work at a bank in an affluent part of Atlanta, and a woman called in to let us know she was offended by the security questions for her online banking. The security questions she set up herself. 11.

My first few months as a 9 1 1 operator were scary, but nothing could have prepared me for when I got a call late at night from a young girl. I could barely understand what she was saying through her sobbing, but she told me she had just swallowed an entire bottle of pills and just wanted someone to talk to before they did anything. I started asking her why she would do that and asked for her address. She thought I already had it. But after a few minutes, she finally told me where she lived. She said she was severely depressed and just wanted everything to end. I asked her why, just trying to keep her on the phone and she said she couldn't take the hate she was getting anymore. I knew I only had literal minutes to do something and tried talking her into throwing up. She told me no. So I asked her what kind of hate she was getting. Apparently, she just wanted people to like her and wanted to help people. She was getting a lot of hate comments on TikTok and even people in real life. Then it all clicked. I knew I recognized her voice and I actually knew who she was. After a few minutes, I asked her if she was who I thought and she was really surprised. I started to tell her how one of her Videos actually changed my life and got me out of a toxic relationship. She knew I wasn't lying because I told her all about it. I asked her one more time and she finally agreed to try and make herself throw up. She was unconscious when the paramedics got there, but because of that, she was still alive. She now has millions of followers and I'm glad to see her much happier today.

When my son was in the third grade, he was a bully. We tried everything, but he kept constantly getting in trouble and sent to the office. He was known throughout the school for tying balloons to the class rabbit and almost letting it float away. I was leaving work to go get him and as my phone rang, I already knew who it was. I had a special ringtone for his teacher because she called me so much just so I could prepare to hear what he did. She was crying when I answered and I knew it was bad. I told her I was on the way, but instead of getting upset, she started to thank me. I was really confused and she started to talk about what a sweet boy I raised. Literally nobody had ever told me that before for. And I asked what happened. Apparently another kid who didn't have a lot of friends was in his class and his mom had handed out birthday invitations to everyone the day before. Right before the bell went off, he stood up in front of everyone and asked who was coming to his party. The entire class was now silent and he just stood there looking around for someone to tell him they were going. Nobody was saying anything. And she said she could see the kids heart literally breaking in Real time. Then, as he went to sit back down in shame, my son stood up and said, I'm gonna come. I'll be there. His face lit up, and one by one, all the other boys in the class followed his lead and also started telling him they'd come, too. He was trying not to cry when we showed up that weekend.

Except one morning our entire class could hear her outside the room getting chewed out by our assistant principal for being late on grading. We also knew she had lost her sister the week before, so she was having a really rough time. A few minutes into teaching, she started explaining something about our final exam and the guys next to me were passing notes. They usually did it every time she turned around, but this time she saw them. She usually wouldn't have cared, but she thought it was something about her. So she walked over and asked to see it.

It's all there with the. And stopped herself before reading the rest out loud. She looked down at the boy, clearly having read something bad and didn't know what to say. Her face was pale and not knowing what to do. She grabbed them both and literally yanked them out of the room. We all sat there confused for a half hour wondering what that note said. There were police at our school and they asked our whole route to come to the office. They questioned everybody about It, but nobody knew anything. And by the time they let us go, they had sent everybody home. We later found out that the note said there was a key to the office in that garbage bin along with a loaded gun. Both of them denied writing it and said they didn't know who it was for. So they decided to fire our teacher for creating a school wide panic and expelled our entire row.

A few students decided to play a senior prank on the principal by writing on his car. And it made him so mad he decided to cancel the entire prom for the year. Everyone was pissed. So at the homecoming game the week after, we were chanting to bring it back. Eventually at the end, some kid with a banana suit jumped over the bleachers and ran across the field. Everyone screamed as he was being chased by coaches and teachers, and even the players loved it. Eventually, they tackled him hard and he ended up breaking his arm and had to go to the hospital. They had to cancel the game and the staff were so mad they suspended him for the rest of the year. He was probably gonna get expelled, but the students loved him so much, they decided they were gonna do something about it. That day, free Banana Man was born and everyone started chanting it in the halls. Few guys sold t shirts that said it and they wrote it all over the walls. At our school, there were bananas everywhere. And this made our principal so mad, he banned the phrase entirely. However, he didn't just stop there. He decided to go as far as to ban the actual fruit itself and even the entire color yellow. You literally weren't allowed to wear yellow to school. And if you were caught eating A banana, you were sent home for the day. This rule made the entire student body so furious they pretty much declared a war on the administration. Hundreds of students were getting sent home because they decided to bring bananas and wear yellow. And when they tell them to take their yellow shirts off, they'd walk around shirtless to class. I even saw a guy come to school in all yellow, and when they made him take it off, he tried to go to class only in his underwear, which was also yellow. It got so crazy that one kid who literally needed to eat bananas for the potassium couldn't for the week and ended up passing out in the middle of class. He went to the hospital and his parents threatened to sue the school. The very next day, we watched our principal walk out for the last time and the banana guy returned wearing his costume.

At first, we tried writing backwards so if teachers or classmates tried to peek, they couldn't read it quickly. But then we realized if our notebooks ever got confiscated, it would still be easy to figure out. So we went full spy mode. We created a whole alphabet, gave each letter its own symbol, and memorized it. Suddenly, we could write full conversations in class, and no one had a clue what we were saying. Bye, high school. We didn't really use it anymore, but I still had all the symbols memorized. One day, I was in class journaling about a crush in the back of my notebook. I wasn't disrupting anyone, but my teacher noticed how into it I was and decided to call me out. He goes, what, are you writing a book over there? Clearly those aren't notes. I froze, snapped the notebook shut immediately. Thankfully, he just made a little joke and moved on. But there was no way I was about to risk my thoughts about this girl being read out loud to the whole class. So the next time I journaled, I switched back. Back to the secret language. To everyone else, it looked like I was just doodling random symbols, but to me, it was the perfect cover. Fast forward. Years later, I find those old notebooks again. And the problem. I had thrown away the Only translator we ever made. Which means all the secrets I wrote as a kid are now locked away forever. In a language even I don't understand anymore. Guys, what do I do?

So my husband Jake has this obsession with sweet tea. Not just any sweet tea, his grandmother's recipe that he makes every single Sunday in this massive gallon pitcher. He uses like 2 cups of sugar, which is disgusting if you ask me. But whatever. The man drinks it all week long and god forbid anyone else touches it. I'm talking about a grown man who literally wrote his name on the picture with a Sharpie. Now, here's where it gets weird. Jake works construction and every morning he fills up this be up old thermos with his precious tea. But here's the thing, he never actually drinks it at work, never. He just carries it around like some kind of security blanket, brings home still full every single day. I thought this was just some quirky habit until last Tuesday when I was doing laundry and found his work shirt absolutely reeking of alcohol. Not beer smell, not wine, straight up vodka. And this wasn't the first time. I've been finding these shirts for weeks. But I kept making excuses. Maybe someone spilled something on him. Maybe he walked past a bar. Stupid stuff like that. So Wednesday morning, I decided to follow him to work. I know how that sounds, but I had to know what was going on. I parked across the street from his job site and watched him for like 20 minutes. The guy pulls out. His thermos unscrews the top, pours out all the sweet tea onto the ground, and then pulls out a bottle of vodka from his lunch box and fills the whole thing up. I sat there in my car just staring. My husband of eight years was day drinking at work. You sing his grandmother's sweet tea recipe as a cover story. The same man who lectured me about having a glass of wine with dinner because someone needs to be responsible in this house. But wait, it gets worse. That night at dinner, he's going on and on about how hard work was, how his back hurts, how his boss is being unreasonable. Meanwhile, I'm looking at him knowing he spent the day sipping vodka out of a thermos while operating heavy machinery. The guy was literally putting people's lives at risk. I didn't say anything that night because I was still processing it. But Thursday morning, same thing. Friday, same thing. By this point, I'm wondering how long this has been going on and how I never noticed. Then I remembered all those times he came home exhausted and went straight to bed at like seven PM all those weekends he was too tired to do any. The man wasn't tired. He was hungover. Sunday comes around and here he is making his weekly batch of sweet tea, humming to himself like nothing's wrong. He's going on about how his grandmother would be so proud that he kept the Tradition alive, how it's the one thing that gets him through the work week. I'm standing there watching him stir in cup after cup of sugar, knowing full well that this, he is just going to end up on the ground while he fills that thermos with vodka. That's when I snapped. The second he went upstairs to shower, I grabbed that pitcher and poured every last drop down the kitchen.

Every Sunday for 15 years, my grandmother made the same announcement at family dinner. When I pass away, everything goes to whoever visits me most. She tap her cane on the floor and smile like she just revealed state secrets. This turned my entire extended family into vultures. My Aunt Rachel drove three hours every Tuesday I just to vacuum Grandma's living room. Uncle Steve called twice daily asking about her arthritis. My cousin Jennifer moved back from California and started doing Grandma's grocery shopping. They all hated each other but pretended to be saints around her. Meanwhile, I was banned from inheritance discussions. I liked guys chicken nuggets and grandma made it crystal clear that sinners don't deserve family money. She changed the subject. Whenever I entered rooms, my cousins would smirk and whisper about how I'd be working at McDonald's while they lived in luxury. But here's what none of them knew. I actually loved spending time with grandma. Not for money, she'd already told me I wasn't getting any, but because she was genuinely funny. When she wasn't performing for the Inheritance Hunters, while they argued over who deserved what, I'd sneak over on Wednesday nights to watch old movies and eat ice cream. Grandma would relax completely. When it was just us, she'd tell dinosaurs jokes from the two thousand BC and complain about how fake everyone was being. She even started Asking about my boyfriend and seemed genuinely interested in our relationship. I never mentioned these visits to anyone because I knew they'd think I was gaming. After she passed last year, the whole family gathered for the will reading. Rachel brought a calculator. Steve wore his funeral suit from 1995. Jennifer had already started planning her European vacation. They were practically drooling as the lawyer opened the envelope.

My boyfriend Jake had been the same couch potato for three years. The guy who needed me to open pickle jars was suddenly doing push UPS at 6:00am. When I asked what sparked this change, he just shrugged and said he wanted to get healthy, but something felt wrong. It start started small. He bought protein powder and left it on the kitchen counter like some kind of trophy. Then he got a gym membership to this fancy place across town instead of the Planet Fitness two blocks away. When I suggested we work out together, he got weird and said he preferred going alone to focus. The red flags kept piling up. He started showering immediately after coming home from the gym, which seemed normal until I realized he never smelled like sweat. His gym clothes were always perfectly clean, too. One day I decided to surprise him with lunch at his gym. The guy at the front desk looked confused when I asked for Jake. Turns out he hadn't been there in weeks. I confronted him that night. He got defensive and said he switched gyms because the other one was too crowded. When I asked which gym, he stuttered and said some random name I'd never heard of. That's when I knew he was lying. So I did what any suspicious girlfriend would do. I followed him the next Tuesday I watched him drive past three different gyms and pull into the parking lot of a Starbucks. Through the window I saw him sitting across from this blonde girl who definitely wasn't just a workout buddy. She was laughing at everything he said and touching his arm constantly. My heart was pounding as I watched them for 20 minutes. When she got up to leave, he grabbed her hand and kissed it. I wanted to storm in there and cause a scene, but instead I waited. He came home an hour later with this fake exhausted look, complaining about how intense his workout was. I played along for two more weeks, watching him lie to my face every single day. He even started buying workout supplements and leaving them around the apartment as props. The worst part was when he'd flex his non existent new muscles and ask if I noticed any changes and I got clever. I told him my friend Emma was looking for a new gym and asked for his recommendation. He panicked and said his gym was full and not taking new members. When I offered to call and check, he quickly said they had a waiting list and it wouldn't be worth it. That weekend Jake said he was going to a special Saturday morning workout class. Instead, I followed him to the same Starbucks. This time they were holding hands across the table and looking at something on her phone together when he Leaned over and kissed her forehead. I knew I had enough evidence, but I didn't confront him yet. I had a better plan. I went home and researched the girl on social media. Found her Instagram through the Starbucks location tag. Her name was Ashley, and according to her posts, she'd been seeing someone new for the past month. The timeline matched perfectly with Jake's and fitness obsession. Monday night, I casually mentioned

My phone buzzed at 2:00am with a text that made me sit straight up in bed. Remember that favor you owe me? I need you to be my boyfriend at my sister's wedding this Saturday. Pick me up at four PM wear navy. It was from Poppy, the girl who saved my entire college career three years ago. I hadn't spoken to her since graduation when I drunkenly promised her anything, anytime, after she spent an entire semester tutoring me through chemistry for free. Without her, I would have lost my scholarship and dropped out. Now she was calling in that favor and honestly, being someone's fake boyfriend for a day seemed like a small price to pay. Plus, if I was being honest with myself, I'd always wondered what it would have been like to actually date. When I picked her up that Saturday, Poppy answered the door looking absolutely stunning in an emerald dress that made her green eyes even brighter. But her expression was all business. She handed me a typed sheet of paper titled Our Relationship Details with bullet points about our first date, how long we've been together and my supposed favourite things about her. Eight months, she said, adjusting my tie without making eye contact. We've been dating eight months. You call me pop sometimes. We met at a coffee shop. Her voice was mechanical like she was reading a grocery list. During the drive, she explained The situation, my parents keep trying to set me up with their business partner's son at every family event. He's perfectly nice, but I'm just not interested. This will shut them up for a while. The whole ride, she was silent. Then when we arrived at the venue, she took a deep breath, grabbed my hand and suddenly transformed into a completely different person. Ready, babe, she said with a bright smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. The ceremony was beautiful. I caught Poppy wiping her eyes during the vows and without thinking, I handed her my pocket square. She looked surprised but took it, whispering thanks so quietly, I almost missed it. During the reception, I found myself forgetting this was an act. When her uncle made a toast, I instinctively put my arm around her shoulders. When the music was too loud to hear her cousin's story, I leaned down so she could whisper it in my ear, her breath warm against my neck. Her grandmother cornered us by the dessert table, pinching my cheeks and telling Poppy in a stage whisper, this one's much better than Adrian. Poppy went rigid at the name, but I squeezed her hand and smoothly changed the subject to Grandma's famous apple pie recipe. The couple's dance was when everything shifted. Poppy was stiff in my arms, counting steps under her breath like she was solving an equation. Hey, I whispered, pulling her closer. Just follow me. Stop thinking so hard. She looked up at me and for a moment, her guard completely dropped. She melted into me, her head finding that perfect spot against my shoulder. We swayed together as the song played and I found myself hoping it would never end. Then during the bouquet toss, she caught it by accident when it bounced off another girl's hands, the crowd cheered, but Poppy immediately handed it to the girl beside her, laughing it off. Just superstition anyway, she said. But I noticed her looking at the flowers longingly as the other girl walked away. Her sister pulled me aside while Poppy was in the bathroom. Thank you, she said, squeezing my arm for making her happy, if it's just for tonight. The words stuck with me. As the night wound down, I realized I wasn't acting anymore. When I looked at her laughing with her cousins, I felt a pull in my chest that had nothing to do with owing her a favor, driving her home. I couldn't keep it in anymore. Poppy, I know this was just repaying a debt, but tonight felt real to me, really real. She went completely still in the passenger seat when I pulled up to her apartment. She practically jumped out of the car. You did great. Perfect. Fake boyfriend. We're even now. The words came out rushed and cold. She was already at her building's door before I could respond. I sat there for five minutes feeling like an idiot before Driving home the next morning, Poppy's sister texted me, you left your.

My sister called me a bad mom until her kid told me the truth. When Emma asked if she could dye her hair blue for her 13th birthday, I said, sure, it's just hair, right? She'd been begging me for weeks, showing me Pinterest photos of these gorgeous ocean blue highlights. Target. We picked out some semi permanent dye that would wash out in a month. She was so excited she could barely sit still while I painted the streaks in our tiny bathroom. The next morning at breakfast, she kept flipping her hair and grinning at herself in the toaster reflection. I made her favourite blueberry pancakes and she kept saying how the blue and her hair match the berries perfectly. honestly the happiest I'd seen her since her dad moved out last year. But when we showed up at my sister Beth's house for Sunday dinner, everything went sideways fast. Beth took one look at Emma and her face just dropped. She pulled me into the kitchen while Emma was playing with her cousins and started going off about how irresponsible I was being. What kind of message does this send, she whispered harshly, gesturing toward the living room. She's going to look like some delinquent at school. I tried explaining it was just temporary hair dye, that Emma was still getting straight A's and playing violin. But Beth wouldn't hear it. She kept shaking her head and muttering about how I was clearly struggling as a single mom and needed to set better boundaries. The whole dinner was awkward after that with Beth making passive aggressive comments about certain parenting choices every time Emma's hair caught the light. When we got home that night, Emma seemed deflated. She kept touching her hair and asking if I thought it looked stupid. I reassured her it looked amazing, but I could tell Beth's reaction had gotten to her. That's when I decided to call my mom to vent about the whole thing. Mom listened patiently while I ranted about Beth being judgmental. Then she got quiet for a moment. Honey, she said carefully, there's something you should probably know about your sister's situation. Apparently, Beth had been calling.

So my brother Jake got married, like, three weeks ago, and the whole thing was basically a slap in the face. His wife Megan, decided nobody under 21 could come because they were serving alcohol and didn't want any minors getting drunk. I was 19 at the time, which apparently made me some kind of liability. The excuse was complete bullshit, and everyone knew it. I don't even drink that much. Maybe a beer here and there with friends, but I'm not some alcoholic teenager who's gonna embarrass their precious wedding. But whatever. That's what they decided, and my parents just went along with it, like always. I asked them to reconsider a few times because, honestly, it hurt. Jake and I used to be close growing up. Shared a room until I was 14, played video games together, the whole thing. But ever since he started dating Megan two years ago, she's basically been calling all the shots. She thinks she's better than everyone because her dad owns some car dealership and she went to private school. After they kept saying no, I just stopped caring. If I wasn't good enough for their wedding, then fine. I wasn't gonna beg anymore. Then last Saturday rolls around, and Jake, our family group chat, saying he wants everyone to go to some fancy steakhouse to celebrate the wedding. My parents were all Excited, talking about how nice it would be to finally celebrate as a family. But I just replied that I wasn't going. My mom called me right away asking why not? I told her the same thing I told everyone else. I didn't see the point in celebrating something I wasn't even invited to. She tried to guilt trip me, saying it would mean a lot to Jake and that my cousins Becca and Tyler were going even though they didn't get invited either. But here's the thing. Becca is 13 and Tyler is 15. Their parents literally forced them to go. They didn't have a choice. I'm 19, I pay my own phone Bill, I work at Best Buy part time, and I'm starting community college in the fall. I can make my own decisions about where I spend my Saturday night. My parents kept trying to convince me all week. My dad even offered to pay for my meal, which honestly just made it worse. Like, you couldn't fight for me to be at the actual wedding, but now you wanna throw money at me to show up to the Celebration dinner? The night of the dinner, I stayed home and ordered pizza. I was playing call of duty with my friends when my phone started blowing up. First it was Jake texting me asking where I was, and Megan sent me this long paragraph about how disappointed she was that I couldn't be mature enough to support my Brother's happiness. The funniest part is they acted all surprised that I didn't show up. I literally told them I wasn't going. What did they expect? After they got home from dinner, Jake came to my room and tried to have some

Like, you're out here doing taxes, applying for jobs, driving cars, but the side of two wheels makes you flinch. Riding a bike is a cannon event in growing up. Like it was an achievement for everybody except for you. And they always say, yeah, I just never really Learned how to. Bro, you had years. What were you doing while the rest of us were outside with scraped knees and helmets too big for our heads? Like, be honest, you can't balance. It's basically walking but with handles. The bike does have to work for you. All you gotta do is not fall over. And don't give me, the bikes were never my thing. Excuse. What does that even mean? Breathing is not my thing either. But here I am doing it every day. I swear, if we ever go on a group ride and you say, I'll meet you there, I better not catch you on a rental e scooter. You trust that wobbly plank with a motor more than a bike? Be serious. You missed out on one of the best childhood feelings, that breeze hitting your face when you're speeding down a hill, feeling like you own the world. Riding a bike isn't just a skill, it's a universal experience. You skipped a childhood achievement. Yeah, but hey, it's not too late to learn. Trust me.

She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend, she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler, who said she was being a total bitch, but I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my Fitness Pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped. Getting coffee with extra syrup, and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better, and she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

It's easier that way, isn't it? People see the smile and assume everything is fine. No awkward questions, no forced explanations, no pity looks, just normal. Because explaining how you really feel, that takes energy you simply don't have. And truth be told, not everyone understands. So you wear the smile like armor, convincing the world that you're okay. But deep down, you're tired. Carrying invisible weights that no one sees, navigating battles that don't show on the surface. And still you keep smiling. Not because you're happy, but because sometimes it's the only way to make it through the day. But here's the truth. You don't always have to smile through it. It's okay to let someone in, even if it's just one person. Sometimes talking won't fix everything, but it can lighten the load. Just enough to breathe again. And that. That's a start.

When my sister Amanda decides she wants attention, she'll claw it out of someone else's skin if she has to. At family gatherings, she was the one who'd loudly announce my bad grades, failed driving test, or awkward crushes to get a cheap laugh. I always took it because that's just Amanda, but she crossed the line. Last month I woke up to 30 notifications on Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. My phone was blowing up with laughing emojis, L M A O s, and tags. Turns out Amanda dug into old photo albums and posted my most humiliating pictures. Me with braces and acne. Me dressed as a clown for Halloween at 12. Me crying at my middle school graduation because my speech went wrong. Captioned some people never grow out of being pathetic. She tagged me in every single one. At first I was mortified. I got DMs from co workers, college friends, even my boss, all seeing my sister publicly roast me like I was still a kid. I called her immediately. Delete them, I said. She laughed into the phone. Relax, it's just for fun. Everyone thinks it's hilarious. You humiliated me in front of everyone I know. Oh, come on, she sneered. You've always been the boring one. Let me have a little fun. It's not like you have a reputation to ruin. That last line hit hard and something in me snapped. Amanda has always painted herself as the golden child, but I knew things about her that she didn't want public things buried in county court records. Things her husband's family had no idea about. I opened my laptop and went digging. It didn't take long to find exactly what I was looking for. Amanda's shoplifting arrest from six years ago. She had been caught stealing makeup and jewelry from a department store. She avoided jail time, but had to pay fines and attend a petty theft class. It was all public record, just forgotten. And then there was her DUI from three years ago, the one mom begged me not to tell anyone about. Amanda had spent a night in jail, had her license suspended for a year, and attended mandatory AA meetings. Both cases public record. She wanted to play dirty. Fine. The next evening, I made a post on Facebook. Simple.

I had to choose. I'm at work on a Tuesday morning when my wife texts having contractions. Think this is it. Meet you at Memorial Hospital. I'm grabbing my car keys when my phone rings. It's my twin sister and she's sobbing. My water just broke. I'm scared. I'm headed to Valencia Hospital. Please come. I freeze in the parking lot holding the phone up to my ear. My wife is 39 weeks pregnant with our first baby. My sister is only 34 weeks, making this a high risk pregnancy. And her boyfriend left her two months ago after they found out the baby has down syndrome. The hospitals are 45 minutes apart in opposite directions. I stand there like an idiot while the two most important women in my life need me in two different places. I drive toward my sister first because she's alone and high risk. I call my wife from the car. When I tell her, she's crying but says she understands. My sister texts, contractions getting stronger. Nurse says I'm 4 cm dilated. I think back to when my sister held my hand through our dad's death when we were 16. She's been there through my depression, my divorce from my first marriage, everything. She chose me as her birth partner months ago when her boyfriend bailed. My wife texts, contractions five minutes apart now. Then I'm scared, too. Then we promised We'd do this together. My wife has an anxiety disorder and she's been planning this birth for three years. Made a playlist, wrote letters to the baby. We practice breathing exercises every night. I'm driving when my breathing starts coming in faster and my hands are shaking so bad, I swerve into the other lane. A truck horn blares and I yank the wheel back, nearly going off the road. I have to pull over on the highway shoulder just so I can gasp for air. Full panic attack, head and hands on the steering wheel trying to breathe. My phone explodes with calls. I answer them one by one. My mother in law is screaming, we just got to the hospital. Where are you? How dare you leave her right now? My father in law texts, get back here now. Man up and support your family. Then my mom calls, we're getting on a plane but that's five hours away. You need to step up as her big brother. Your sister has nobody. The baby might not survive. My dad texts, blood comes first. Your wife has family, your sister has no one. I sit there for a moment longer, breathing. Then I call both hospitals. My sister's nurse says she's asking for you. She's terrified. My wife's nurse told me she's progressing fast. Where are you? My phone's at 5% battery from all the calls at this point. The last thing I hear is my mother in law. Saying, if you're not here when that baby comes, don't bother coming home. My phone dies right there in my hands, still vibrating with another call coming in. I choose to go to my sister because she's alone and at higher risk. I speed toward her hospital, crying the whole way. I run into the emergency room, asking for her delivery room. The nurse looks confused.

There's no hate about being plus size. In fact, I think everybody is beautiful no matter. some of these self centered influencers don't seem to think the same. If you know you have a plus size body, which is perfectly fine if you're healthy, you cannot go into a store like Brandy Melville, which is a store specifically made for petite sizes and teenagers. Especially since they only have one size and expect their clothes to fit you. And then you go online to tell the whole world to hate on Brandy Melville because their petite sizes couldn't fit you. And I think y'all know who I'm talking about. News flash there's different body types besides plus size that need to have accommodations to their clothes to fit them. Brandy Melville is one of the stores that provide accommodations for petite sizes. It's the same thing as a skinny woman going into a store specifically made for plus size people like Taylor or Lane Bryant and complaining on the internet that the clothes are too baggy on them. Like what did you expect? Not everything is going to accommodate to you, whether your ego believes it or not. So no, if you are not petite or close to that body type, you are most likely not going to be able to fit into petite size clothes. Which is actually pretty obvious. Oh boy, you really solved the case this time, didn't ya Sherlock? Maybe next time Enola will guide us towards the common sense. That's not even the bad part. The bad part is that the bickering has actually worked. There has been a noticeable increase of Brandy Melville's one size clothes are too big on the ones who actually need them to be small. And notice how I'm only talking about Brandy Melville. That's because it's the only store that actually has trendy and style affordable and cute clothing for petite women. The unreasonable hate is taking that away from girlies who actually need it. We need inclusivity! All bodies are beautiful. Until it's skinny women anyways. Who's a spray 6 9 O U T ho ho ho!

The daycare called me at work saying Alara had been inconsolable for two hours. This wasn't normal. Alar was the easiest baby ever. Never fussed unless something was seriously wrong. In her eight months of life, she'd only had maybe three real crying episodes. Once when she had an ear infection, once when she fell and bumped her head, and once when she had a stomach bug. Each time, I could calm her down within minutes just by holding her. But according to the daycare worker on the phone, nothing was working. They'd tried feeding her, changing her, rocking her, even putting her in the swing she usually loved. The woman sounded frazzled, almost annoyed. She's disrupting the other children, she said. Maybe you should come get her early today. I asked if I could talk to Miss Caren, the head caregiver, who Alara absolutely adored. Alara would light up every morning when she saw Miss Caren's face. But the woman said Miss Caren was busy with the other kids. Something about that phone call bothered me. The entire drive over, the daycare worker hadn't sounded concerned, just irritated. Like Alara crying was more of an inconvenience than something to worry about. I've been using Sunshine Daycare for six months, ever since I went back to work. It came highly recommended, had great reviews online, and Miss Karin seemed to genuinely care about all The kids. She'd send me photos throughout the day of Alara playing and smiling. She remembered details about Alara's routine, her favorite toys, even the face she made when she didn't like her food. I trusted this place completely. When I told my boss I had to leave for a family emergency, he didn't question. I grabbed my keys and practically ran to the parking garage. The entire 15 minute drive, I kept trying to think of what could be wrong. Maybe Alara was getting sick and I just hadn't noticed the signs this morning. Maybe she was having a growth spurt and needed more food. Maybe she missed me more than usual today. But deep down, something felt off. Alara had never been described as in consolable by anyone, ever. Even my mother in law, who had strong opinions about everything, always commented on how calm and happy Alara was. When I pulled into the daycare parking lot, I immediate we knew something was wrong. I could hear crying from the parking lot. Not just Alara, but multiple babies screaming. It sounded like chaos inside. In all the months I've been dropping Alara off and picking her up, I'd never heard anything like this. Usually there might be one child fussing here and there, but this sounded like every baby in the place was upset. I walked up to the front entrance and tried the door. Locked. Which was weird because pickup wasn't for another hour and a half. The daycare was supposed to be open until six PM and it was only 4:30. I knocked on the front door and waited. No one came. The crying was getting louder and I could definitely pick out Alara's.

My six year old nephew absolutely destroyed my sister at Thanksgiving dinner. And honestly, she deserved it. My sister Emma has always been obsessed with appearances. Perfect makeup, designer clothes, constantly taking selfies. She's the type who spends two hours getting ready just to go to target. At family dinners, she'd always make these passive aggressive comments about everyone else's life choices. So we're all sitting around the table last Thanksgiving, Emma shows up an hour late because she had to get her nails done. She's wearing this ridiculous white dress to a family dinner where we're eating gravy and cranberry sauce. Classic Emma move. She immediately starts her usual routine. Comments about how mom's stuffing has too much salt this year. Mentions how Uncle Rick should probably lay off the dinner rolls. Makes this big show of only eating tiny portions because she's watching her figure. Then she turns to my brother Jake, who just started community college. So, Jake, still taking those little classes? When are you going to get a real degree? Jake just stared at his plate. The kids working two jobs to pay for school. Emma kept going. She asked my cousin about her starter apartment and wondered when she'd get a grown up job. She even made a comment about dad's old truck in the driveway, saying it was embarrassing. The whole time, my nephew Tyler was just sitting there eating his Turkey And watching Tyler's Jake's six year old son. Super quiet kid, usually just plays with his food and doesn't say much during adult conversations. Emma was on roll. She started talking about her new boyfriend's BMW and how they're looking at condos downtown. Really laying it on thick about how successful she is compared to everyone else. Then she made her biggest mistake. She looked at Tyler and said, Tyler, sweetie, make sure you study hard in school so you don't end up like your daddy, okay? The table went dead silent. Jake's face turned red. Mom literally gasped. Dad put down his fork and just stared at Emma. But Tyler. Tyler just looked up from his mashed potatoes, blinked those big innocent eyes, and said in the sweetest voice ever, Aunt Emma, why?

Yeah, the number that every little brain rotted kid has been spamming these past few months like it's a sacred ritual to summon the meme god. Turns out this isn't just some random number. There's actually a lore behind it. It all started off with the meme No. 69 way back in 2000, 2,018 to 2,020. Just like 6, 7, kids were always pointing out the No. 69, except this was more immature and freaky. So what does this have to do with 6, 7? You guys remember why 6 is afraid of 7? It's because 7 ate 9. Yeah, after seeing 69 being in the spotlight, 7 got hungry for the same attention and literally ate 9. It then overtook 9 spot and became 6, 7. Now kids are spamming 6, 7 like they're hoping to be blessed with Seven's power. Everything literally makes perfect sense now. Or maybe I just need therapy.

It's only been 11 days and the world is completely off its fucking rocker. Charlie Kirk was killed in front of his family. David was found with a body in his car. A Ukrainian girl was stabbed on the subway. And now Elon Musk isn't even the richest man on the planet anymore. Can we chill for one second? First, Charlie Kurt got shot during a speech in Utah. He was literally in front of his wife and kids when a bullet entered his artery through his neck. The scene was so bloody and gruesome, it's insane. A Ukrainian girl gets stabbed on a train in Charlotte. She escaped a literal war, came here to be safe and still got killed because this planet has zero peace. Then D4D has a whole body in his car, like not a metaphorical one, an actual human body in a bag in his trunk. And this dude just casually performed like he didn't have a horror movie in his backseat. What the hell? And even outside all of that, Elon Musk is no longer the richest person in the world, losing his top spot to a rival tech CEO, showing how unstable everything feels right now, even at the highest levels. It's like every time I open my phone, reality speed runs another tragedy. Like, bro, it's been 11 days. September just started. I thought my only problem this month would be math class, but no, apparently it's Full blown world collapse. Society isn't just cooked, it's burnt to ash. Wakati Huo.

I don't know if anyone else feels this, but it's like I'm never really alone, but I'm never really chosen either. I'm the one people are happy to see in the group, the one they'll talk to if no one else is around, the one that's nice and easy to hang out with. But when it comes down to it, I'm never the person someone calls first. I'm not the best friend, the ride or die, the person they can't wait to text when something happens. I'm just there. Always included, never prioritized. It's such a mind fuck because technically I have friends. I'm not isolated, but I still feel invisible. I'll be standing right there laughing with everyone and still feel like an extra in my own life. Like I'm the supporting character in their story, but never the main one in mine. And yeah, it hurts. It fucking hurts watching everyone else pair off, have their person, while I'm the one left lingering in the background. I'm good enough for everyone, but not special enough for anyone.

There has been a school shooting in Denver. A girl got stabbed on the subway and no one helped her. A decomposing body found in D4V D's car. A man was beheaded at Dallas motel. Charlie Kirk getting shot and killed at a university. And all on top of that, the 9 11 was 24 years ago today. As much as I hate Charlie Kirk and his decisions, no one deserves to get killed. Imagine what his wife and kids are feeling right now. His children can't grow up with their dad. His wife is now a single parent. I genuinely hate Charlie, but I can't imagine how his family is handling this right now. And apparently they witnessed it. The way the blood came out of his neck was genuinely traumatizing. The way his body went limp immediately was horrifying. But anyways, moving on to the D4 V D situation. He's been on tour for like what, a month now? He hasn't been in LA for like a month. And the body hadn't decomposed enough for it to be in that car for so long. The body was in there for three days, and the police haven't even made him a suspect. And plus he had a concert like yesterday, I'm pretty sure. But yeah, moving on to the girl that was stabbed. She was literally minding her business before she got stabbed. And as soon as she got stabbed, everyone was So calm. Like, hello, she needs help. There was literal blood dripping on the floor. I don't have much information on the other situations, but the fact that this is all happened in a week is honestly scary. Like, this month has just started. What's going on

September just got even crazier. So it turns out that Charlie Kirk's shooter has just been identified. Life was found on Mars. Nepal actually burn down their government and the Epstein files just got released. Just days ago. Charlie Kirk was shot and killed during a speech at Utah Valley University. The shooter, 22 year old Tyler Robinson has already been identified and arrested. It turns out that his own dad turned him into the police after finding out what a disturbing thing his son has done and he's now facing many charges. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Nepal has erupted. Weeks of youth LED protests over corruption and broken promises turned into full blown chaos. Government buildings were torched. The prime minister was forced to resign and the one piece flag was even hung as a symbol of hope. And while all of that was happening, Mars quietly entered the conversation. NASA's rover has detected possible biosignatures, signs that there might have once been ancient life on the planet. It's the closest we've ever come to extraterrestrial life. At the same time, over 33,000 pages of the Jeffrey Epstein files were released to the public. Thousands of names and connections that people are still coming through with some of the world's most powerful figures being linked to him. It's only been 12 days and it already feels like the whole world balance is shifting.

I'm in class, stomach rumbling like a fucking baying whale, and suddenly I'm speed walking to the bathroom. Like I'm in mission impossible, but before I can even shit I gotta play stall roulette. One got a drawing of a mutilated face so detailed it belongs in the Louvre. The next one soaked in piss. Seat, floor, walls, everywhere. Third one literal shit on the seat. Last one no door, just wide open. Like I'm shitting on display at a zoo. So I finally find a stall that's barely functional and the second my cheeks hit the seat, a whole ass festival starts. Some dude walks in like hey Yo, who taking a dump? Bitch, why are you asking that? What do you want me to say? It's me. Now I'm frozen, cheeks spread, heart pounding, trying to be dead silent. Like I'm in a horror movie and the killers right outside. I'm scared to even breathe. My ass clenched harder than the great Beaver Dam. And there's always one guy who won't leave. He's doing his hair, taking mirror selfies, watching Tik Toks on full volume like this bathroom is his Fucking Studio apartment. Meanwhile, I'm in the stall holding in a stinky shirt, about to break through enemy lines when I finally drop one. It echoes through the school like an airstrike. I flush mid shit to hide the sound, but it makes It worse now. It sounds like I'm battling a demon in stall three. Then I walk out. Boom. Eye contact with someone I know. Judgment, disgust. Like I just dropped a war crime in there. And when I sit back down in class, my friend turns around like, I know you just took a massive shit.

I hated group projects more than anything in college. Every single time I'd end up doing all the work while everyone else just showed up for the grade. So when Professor Williams assigned our final ethics project worth 30% of our grade, I swore things would be different this time. The professor randomly put me with three students I barely knew, Alex, Jordan and Sam. I was actually excited because maybe working with strangers would mean they'd actually care about their grades. Boy, was I wrong. I made a group chat the same day and sent detailed messages about meeting times, dividing up the work and setting deadlines. Radio silence, tried again the next day, nothing. I even walked up to Alex after class and asked if he got my messages. He just shrugged and said, yeah, we'll figure it out later. Two weeks passed. The 20 page research paper was due in 10 days and nobody had written a single word. I kept sending messages, trying to set up meetings, offering to do video calls. They left me on read every single time. I had a choice. I could let our whole group fail or I could do what I always did. So I spent the next week pulling all nighters, researching corporate ethics scandals, writing analysis after analysis, adding proper citations and references, 23 pages of solid work. I was exhausted but proud when I submitted It online. I only put my name on it, not theirs, just mine. The very next morning, the day before our presentation, my phone started buzzing like crazy. Alex was calling me over and over. When I finally picked up, he sounded panicked. Hey, Maya, we're all ready to present now. Just make sure you add our names back to the title slide before class. Okay? I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Add your names back. You guys didn't help write anything. Come on, don't be like that. We're a team. Just put us on there. I hung up. 20 minutes later, Sam was knocking on my dorm room door acting all friendly like we were best friends. Maya, hey, we just wanna make sure everything's good for tomorrow. We can all present different sections. What sections did you write? I asked. Well, we didn't technically write them, but we can present them. That's basically the same thing, right? I told her no and closed the door. That's when things got ugly. They emailed Professor Williams that same night claiming I had excluded them maliciously from the project and refused to collaborate. They said I was trying to take all the credit for work they had done. They even said I deleted their contributions from the shared document. Professor Williams replied to all of us the next morning. He said there would be a hearing after class where each person would be graded individually based on what they could Prove they contributed. When I walked into the classroom for our presentation, my three group members were already there with printed papers and fake concerned expressions. They had actually printed out what looks like rough drafts with their names on them. During the hearing, they went first. Alex claimed he had written the entire introduction, that I had deleted it and rewritten it in my own words. Jordan said he had researched all the case studies, but I had stolen his work. Sam said she had done the conclusion, but I had cut her out completely. They showed Professor Williams.

Me and my older brother, Nate, were best friends growing up. He was everything I wanted to be. Tough, protective, always getting me out of trouble when I messed up. When I broke Mrs. Wilson's window playing baseball, Nate took the blame and got grounded for two weeks. When I failed my math test, he spent hours helping me study for the retake. We shared everything. Our tiny bedroom, video games, even a fake ID when we got to college. Our parents died in a car crash when I was 15. The whole world felt like it was ending. But Nate stepped up immediately. He was only 22, barely an adult himself, but he became my legal guardian without hesitation. He dropped out of his senior year, got two jobs, working at a warehouse during the day and cleaning offices at night. I never heard him complain once. He'd come home exhausted, covered in sweat and dust, but still help me with homework. When other kids got allowances, Nate made sure I had lunch money. When I wanted new sneakers, he worked overtime to get them. He never made me feel like a burden, even though I knew I was draining every penny he earned. I graduated high school with decent grades and got into State College. Nate was so proud, he cried at my graduation. Said our parents would have been proud, too. He kept working those same two jobs to pay My tuition, living off ramen noodles and hope. I promised him someday I'd pay him back for everything. Four years later, I landed a good job at an accounting firm, finally making real money. First thing I did was try to give Nate Cash, but he refused. Said seeing me succeed was payment enough. That's just how he was. Never wanted anything for himself. Last Thanksgiving, I brought my fiance Emma, home to meet him. She'd heard all my stories about my amazing big brother who raised me. They got along great. Laughing at old photos, Nate telling embarrassing stories about when I was little. Everything felt perfect. Later that night, after Emma went to bed, Nate asked me to sit down. He looked nervous, fidgeting with his coffee cup like he used to do when we were kids. And he had something serious to tell me.

My wife Stephanie waited until we were eating dessert at Cassie and Paul's house to drop this on me. We should swap partners every Thursday, she said, and I literally watched her put her hand on Paul's thigh under the table. I saw it. Cassie saw it, too, and her face went blank. What? I asked because I honestly thought I heard her wrong. Partner swapping. We date each other's spouses. She said it like she was talking about switching cars for the weekend. Paul kept staring at his plate and wouldn't make eye contact with me. It's already decided, Stephanie said. Thursday nights, you take Cassie out, Paul takes me. I felt my chest get tight. When did they decide this without me? This is insane, I told her. Then she leaned in close and whispered, room 2:37 last Tuesday when you were at work. My whole body went numb. She was telling me she'd already cheated and now wanted my permission to keep doing it. So are you in or not? She asked louder. I looked at Cassie, and she was crying without making any sound. Fine, I said. Let's swap partners. Stephanie smiled like she just won something. But then I noticed Cassie had stopped crying completely. That should have told me something right there. When the first date night came around, Stephanie spent forever getting ready. She put on this Red dress I've never seen before that she'd been hiding in our closet. Paul's car was already running in our driveway when I left. I brought Cassie white roses because I remembered she mentioned liking them once. Her hands shook when she took them. Paul? Never. She started, then stopped. At dinner. She pushed her food around and barely ate anything. You okay? I asked. Paul's been different, she said quietly. For months, even before. Then she stopped talking again. I reached over and touched her hand. Before what? Nothing. Forget I said anything. But then her phone lit up with Stephanie's name, and she turned it face down immediately. When I got home that night, Stephanie was already there. Her hair was all messed up and her lipstick was smeared on the wrong side of her mouth. How was Cassie? Good. How was Paul? Then she started telling me everything they did. The hotel room, the balcony, what they did against the wall. Kept getting louder with each detail. Stop, I told her. Why? Don't you wanna know? No. Her face got all twisted up. Well, I'm telling you anyway. She kept going with more details while I pulled out my phone and texted Cassie, thank you for a lovely evening. Stephanie saw my screen and threw her wine glass at the wall. It shattered everywhere, and I just stood there looking at her. The next week, I had to pick Cassie up because her car broke down. Out Of nowhere. Paul was supposed to drive me, she said, looking confused. Forgot at dinner. She had way too much wine. Can I tell you something? She asked, and her eyes looked glassy. Tuesday afternoons. That's when it started. My heart started racing. What started? She covered her mouth with her hand. Nothing. Forget it. But Tuesday was when Stephanie had mentioned the hotel and we both knew what she meant. Then we had to go to Stephanie's parents house for dinner. Stephanie showed up late and I could smell Paul's Cologne all over her clothes. Her mom noticed it right away and her face changed. Is that men's Cologne? The whole table went quiet. We're sharing partners with Cassie and Paul, I said. Every week. Her dad dropped his fork and it made this

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years, and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding, when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size, and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort, and then suggested I might want to start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend, she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler, who said she was being a total bitch, but I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my Fitness Pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped. Getting coffee with extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. First month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better, and she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

My half sister Heather and I never really got along. It doesn't help that Heather's mom hates me and my mom. She has always tried to one up me. She thinks she is better than me and tells all our cousins that I am insecure because my dad chose their family over my mom and me. She never fails to make all my life events all about her, like my graduation party where she announced that she was accepted into a prestigious university. Now my fiance and I got engaged last month and had our engagement party this Saturday. We had planned it originally as a casual formal event, nice dresses, but not I am going to the Met Gala. Nice. More like we are going to a good restaurant. Nice. Anyway, my cousin hits me up saying she has to show me something. It was the picture of the dress. Heather was gonna wear this dress, Jesus Christ. It can only be described as opulent. It was long and white, strapless with sewn in crystals and golden accents. I'm pretty sure it's a wedding dress, but I can't be 100%. This made me really mad. I started texting people telling them that there had been a change of plans and instead of a casual formal, I decided to have a costume. Party. My mother's side is crazy for Halloween, so they were immediately on board. I told my father via text and asked him to relay the message to Heather and her mother, knowing full well that he would forget or leave it to the last minute. Saturday comes along and guests start showing up. Most of them are in costumes and some didn't have time to get one. We just provided them with fun hats and cheap wigs. My fiance was dressed as bubbles and I was dressed as.

Classmates, teachers, even random strangers. I was like, you're so pretty to anyone who'd listen. I remember one time at the grocery store, there was this cashier who always looked super tired, like she hated her job. I walked up with my mom and just said, you're really pretty. She froze for a second, then her whole face lit up. She laughed, thanked me, and even gave me a sticker from the I thought I just unlocked some Secret Life hack. Say nice things, make people happy. My mom eventually pulled me aside and was like, why do you keep doing that? And I told her, because it makes people smile. Like it was that simple to me. I just like making people happy for a second. And now these nine year olds in my comment section are calling me cybiao. Like, bro, I don't even know what that means, but judging by the way they're spamming it, I don't think it means.

It's a high stakes social mission. And there's always that one kid who says something like, I spent a month backpacking through Europe and then I went scuba diving in Australia, bro. Oh, calm down. We get it. You're a world traveler. Then you have the goofball who just lies for no reason. He'll say, I fought a shark and won. Wrap it up, bro. No one believes you.

It's just a chill guy. But a wasp. A wasp is chaotic evil. It was created by the universe for the sole purpose of causing problems. It's spawns into the world and chooses violence.

I giggled nervously. Um, yeah. Why? No, no, no, no, no! Oh! She suddenly screamed while walking as far away from me as possible. I just laughed because moms can be so weird sometimes. But the next day, my daughter came home from school crying. Mommy! Leah said her mom said she can't talk to me anymore. Leah was her best friend. I immediately took out my phone and texted her mom, asking if everything was okay. No response. I texted Emily's mom, one of the other girls in her trio. Still nothing. I had just managed to calm my baby girl down when the pizza arrived. Usually our delivery guy is the Appatron 5,000. But tonight he just set the box on my doorstep and practically ran away. George, you forgot your tip! I yelled, waving a 20. Just kept going. The next few days were insane. At my daughter's soccer practice, Helen saw me walking towards her and held her phone to her ear. No one had even called her, Helen, what's going on? She mouths sorry and walked faster. We used to complain about our husbands together. Parents were whispering and showing each other something on their phones when I walked by. They quickly put them away. By Thursday, my daughter was refusing to go to school. They moved my desk away from everyone else. Teacher said it was for space reasons, but there's like ten feet between me and Leah now. I tried to bring her to the hairdresser to cheer her up, but when the woman saw me coming, she closed early. No apology. Just flipped the sign and pulled the blinds. My phone buzzed. It was my landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry. Rent can wait this month. This was the same man who charged me a fifty dollar inconvenience it's fee when I paid rent at 12:00am instead of midnight. Then the birthday party. Emily sleepover. My daughter found out that everyone was invited except her. She was having such a bad panic attack that I had to call a hospital. Mom, what did I do? Emily is my best friend. Enough was enough. I called the school office. Something is happening to my daughter. She's being systematically excluded and I need answers right now. The counselor called back within an hour, but her voice was off. Like she was choosing every word carefully. Missus Callahan, we just wanted to check in about your home environment. Is everything safe? Anyone new spending time around your daughter? What? What are you even asking me? I think it's best if we discuss this in person. Can you come in tomorrow morning? No. You'll tell me right now why my daughter is being tortured. Long pause. The principal will explain everything tomorrow. Beep. She hung up. Then at 11 p m. An email from My gym membership terminated effective immediately. I've been going there for 5 years. The owner knew me by name. I was trying to figure out what to do when my daughter crawled into my bed at 2:00am, sobbing, Mommy, am I ugly? It took everything in me not to burst into tears. The lunch lady wouldn't look at me today. She just pointed at my tray. I finally caved. On Saturday morning, I found myself walking towards the principal's office while being escorted by a security guard. Other parents there for Saturday sports hold their kids against the walls as we passed. One mom literally shielded her son with her body, like we were dangerous. In his office, the principal locked the door behind us. The click was so loud in the silence, he walked to the windows and twisted the blinds shut. My daughter grabbed my hand tighter. Please sit down. I'll stand. What is this about? He sat at his desk, fingers hovering over his keyboard, then pulled them back. Mister Griffin, you're scaring me. Missus Callahan. He was looking at his screen, not at me.

He sacrificed everything to give his kids a better life than he ever had. He sold his truck to pay for my sister's emergency surgery when insurance said they wouldn't cover it. He worked triple shifts for six months straight to afford my brother's rehab. He even quit his job when I was getting bullied so he could homeschool me for a year. Three weeks was all the doctors gave him after finding tumors everywhere. The 40 years of breathing factory chemicals to support us finally caught up to him. They set him up with home hospice care so he could die in his own bed. He called all of us kids together on Facetime. Since my siblings lived states away, all he wanted was at least one day with each of us before he died. Nothing complicated, he said with that raspy voice the cancer gave him. Just come sit with your old man one more time. I promised him I would be there every single day since I lived 20 minutes away. My siblings swore they would come in immediately to take their turns with him. The morning my sister was supposed to arrive, dad woke up at five in the morning to get ready. The morphine made him dizzy, but he shaved, combed his hair and put on his good flannel shirt anyway. He spent three hours making her favourite cinnamon rolls from Scratch. He had to keep sitting down to breathe, but he finished them. I got there at nine to help him set everything up. Then he sat in his recliner by the window and watched for her all morning. Around 10, he said maybe her flight was delayed, but we both knew that wasn't true. By noon, she still hadn't shown up. When he called her, it went straight to voicemail, and she left all of his texts on read. Around dinner time, she finally texted him back and said her law firm had an emergency. But two hours later, she posted photos from a beachside restaurant where she was having dinner with her friends. I held his hand while he cried for the first time since mom died. The cinnamon rolls sat on touched until I threw them away after he cried himself to sleep. My brother was supposed to come the next day. Dad had me pull out the photo albums from when we were kids. He kept touching the pictures of my brother's first day of school and telling me stories I'd heard a hundred times. My brother called that morning and said, dad, I'm definitely coming, but this client meeting got moved to noon, and it's a million dollar deal, so just give me a few more hours. Dad waited in that recliner all day, but he never showed up. That night, I saw my brother posting videos from a bar. He was doing shots with Co workers and celebrating some deal they closed. Dad asked me to put the photo albums away, looking defeated. Least I have you, he whispered. The next morning, his hospice nurse, Nancy, came for her regular visit and immediately knew something was wrong. She checked his vitals and told me he was declining much faster than expected and might only have hours left. Dad asked Nancy to call my siblings for him. I sat there holding Dad's hand while she begged them to come say goodbye to him while they still could. She put it on speaker so dad could hear everything. My sister spoke first. Oh, my god. Is he seriously doing this right now? Class like dad. He always has to make everything about him. This is just another guilt trip, and I'm not falling for it. My brother jumped in next. He chose that toxic factory job over spending time with us, and now he wants us to drop everything because he. He's dying from it. That is actually hilarious. Then my sister said the worst thing possible. Tell him, I said. Thanks for the college money, but I am not wasting my vacation days to watch him rot. Dad's entire face changed into something I had never seen before. Pure ice. After they hung up, he was silent for a full minute. Then he said, call my lawyer right now. Tell him it is an emergency. Lawyer arrived within an hour with a notary. Dad signed Everything with steady hands. And recorded a video with the lawyer's phone. My two oldest children just taught me something important, he said to the camera. They think visiting me before I die is a waste of their vacation days. So they won't get a single penny when I'm gone. Everything I spent 40 years destroying my body for will go to the two people who were here for me while I died. My nurse Nancy, held my hand through hell. And my youngest never left my side. He stared straight at the lens. I spent my whole life proving I loved you both. But you just proved you never loved me back. Congratulations. You're both orphans now. Later that night, dad died with Nancy and me beside him. The house went to me and his entire safe.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together, I've been playing husband since year two, paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down, tears in her eyes, hand on her heart. Then some perfectly rehearsed excuse, we're not ready. Let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5, and she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time, convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favourite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it when she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew, and she didn't even let me finish the speech. Just shook her head with this pitying smile like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke, asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant and the mask came. Completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said. Voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place. For eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place. Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next this morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I'd spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. The time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. She didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working, she texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic started. Creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not.

My younger sister Ariana turned into a homewrecker the moment my husband Kevin slipped the ring on my finger and started a desperate pick me routine. If Kevin were blue, she'd show up in blue. If you mentioned liking something, she'd become an expert overnight. If he posted about a restaurant, she coincidentally appeared during our date. It started subtle, almost innocent. Even like sitting next to Kevin at every family dinner, Ariana would squeeze between us, claiming she couldn't hear from the other end. I didn't mind since family is family. But after six months, it got obvious. Kevin joined a gym near his office. Ariana got a membership there the next day, showing up during his workout times and tiny sports bras. Kevin mentioned liking astronomy once. Suddenly, Ariana was texting him NASA articles daily, asking, can you explain? Then came the fake emergencies. Her car broke down near Kevin's office. Her apartment had a gas leak when I was out of town. She needed help moving heavy boxes that turned out to be empty, Kevin always told me, immediately showing me her texts with eye rolls. She's just young and confused, he'd say. And I agreed until she officially went too far. A hard knock at 9:00am and there stood Ariana in a tiny white sundress, full makeup, hair curled like a magazine shoot. I need Kevin's Help moving furniture, she announced, pushing past me. Where is he? But we both knew she lived in a furnished apartment. I was about to tell her to leave when she added, I'm sure you have errands to run. You can go away now. She was literally trying to dismiss me from my own home. Kevin came downstairs and she immediately grabbed his arm. Oh, perfect. You're already dressed. I promise I'll return him in one piece. She actually winked at me. I felt my chest burn with rage, but then had a different thought. I headed upstairs, loudly saying, I need to take a bath. But I didn't leave or go to the bathroom. I stayed upstairs where I could hear everything through the vents. She didn't waste any time. Oh, my God, Kevin, you're so muscular, she giggled, clearly touching his arm. Do you work out every day? I bet you could lift me with one hand. Wanna try? I rolled my eyes. This girl had zero shame. I kept holding laundry, waiting for Kevin's polite deflection. Instead, I heard him say, seriously, Ariana, can I tell you something important? My heart sank. Oh, god, here we.

First thing, he'll try to make you laugh, even if it means making a fool of himself. Your smile is worth it. TikTok can reveal who secretly likes you. It's the second person that shows up when you click share. Then more. Boys will often find excuses to be around you, like asking for your help or accidentally bumping into you. 20 million people have the same birthday as you. Write yours in the comments to see who shares it. If he's always the first to view your stories or react to your posts, it's because he's keeping an eye on what you're up to. Most people's phone doesn't have this secret emoji. Just comment star in square brackets to unlock it. Boys might act more confident or try to impress you when they're around you. It's their way of catching your attention. If you wanna know more signs like this, follow now because you won't wanna miss what's next. When a guy likes you, he'll find ways to touch you, even if it's just a friendly pat on the back or a high five. If he remembers tiny details you've mentioned, like your favourite song or a story from months ago, he's definitely interested. Hit like if you've seen these signs before, and drop a comment if you think someone's been showing them to you. And here's the last one. Boys might tease or playfully annoy you, but it's just their way Of getting closer and seeing your reaction.

My high school made all the boys holding their pee because someone wrote hi on the wall in Sharpie. Monday morning we all showed up to find a sign taped to the boys bathroom door. Closed until further notice due to vandalism. The girls bathroom was still open, of course, but our school only had one bathroom for boys in the entire building because it was an old school built in the 60s when they apparently thought teenage boys never needed to pee. Principal Carpenter made an announcement during first period. Due to the disrespectful graffiti found in the boys restroom, this facility will remain locked until someone comes forward with information about who did it. The entire male population of our high school groaned at the same time. The crazy part was what the graffiti actually said. My friend Peyton had seen it Friday before they locked everything up. Someone had written HI in tiny letters on the bathroom stall. Not a curse word, not a drawing. Just HI I in black Sharpie about the size of a quarter. By lunch, the situation was getting desperate. Guys were asking teachers for hall passes to go to the nurse's office just to use that bathroom. But the school nurse caught on quick and started turning people away unless they were actually sick. Some guys tried using the staff bathroom, but got detention for that. A few desperate souls walked To the gas station across the street during lunch. But security started watching for that, too. We tried talking to Principal Carpenter. Reasonably. Group of five guys went to his office to explain that punishing 300 boys for one tiny word was insane. He sat behind his big desk with his arms crossed. Actions have consequences. When the vandal comes forward, everyone gets bathroom privileges back. By Wednesday, things were getting bad. Guys were dehydrated from not drinking water all day. The basketball team couldn't practice properly because half the players were holding it in. Parents started calling to complain. The carpenter wouldn't budge. He sent out an email saying this was a lesson in collective responsibility. That's when Dean Patterson had his brilliant idea. He was this quiet kid.

I paused, looked around, and said, I never got any money. The entire table went silent. You could hear the clinking of silverware from other tables, but at ours, dead quiet. My parents froze. My dad's fork literally clattered onto his plate, and my mom's hand started shaking as she reached for her wine glass. What do you mean you never got any money? Grandma asked, her voice getting that sharp edge I remembered from when she caught my cousins lying as kids. My mom cleared her throat nervously. Mother, we can explain this later. No! Grandma's voice cut through the air like a knife. Explain it now. I've been sending three thousand dollar checks to Monica every single month since Aubrey started college. Where is that money? My brain was spinning. Three thousand dollars a month for four years. I started doing the math in my head while everyone stared at me. That's when my little sister Savannah, who'd been scrolling through Instagram this whole time, suddenly looked up. Oh, wait. Is that where mom got the money for my BMW? If the table was quiet before, now it was like a tomb. Savannah, shut up! My mom hissed, but it was too late. And my spring break trip to Cancun last month, Savannah continued, completely oblivious to the horror spreading across everyone's faces. And that designer bag you bought me for Christmas. I felt like I was watching my life in slow motion. Four years. Four brutal years of working three jobs just to afford ramen noodles and textbooks. 60 hour work weeks while my parents took family vacations. Sleeping in a moldy basement apartment while my sister got a luxury car you stole from me. I said, my voice barely a whisper. My dad finally found his voice. Aubrey, Sweetheart, it's not what it looks like. Really? I stood up, my chair scraping against the floor. Because it looks like you watched me destroy my health. Working multiple jobs while you used my money to spoil Savannah. The restaurant felt like it was spinning. I remembered all those phone calls home, begging for help with textbooks, with rent, with groceries. All those times they said money was tight, they couldn't help. I needed to learn responsibility. How much? Grandma's voice was ice cold. I did the math out loud, my voice getting stronger with each. No. 3,000 * 12 months times four years. $144,000. My mom started crying. We were going to pay it back when you graduated. With what money? I laughed, but there was no humor in it. You don't have that kind of cash lying around. You spend it all on Savannah's lifestyle. Savannah finally looked up from her phone, realize. I think this was about her. Wait, so I have to give the car back? Are you serious? Right now. I turned to her. You're worried about keeping a car that was bought with stolen money while I've been eating peanut butter sandwiches for dinner? That's when Uncle Stewart would've been unusually quiet. Spoke up Monica

Oh, honey, let me tell you about the time my daughter didn't talk to me for two whole weeks because I betrayed her trust over a damn chicken nugget. So my daughter Lila, she's 14, has the attitude of a Beverly Hills housewife and the budget of a toddler. This girl acts like she's the CEO of the household, tells me things like, mom, please don't embarrass me in front of my friends. Just stand still and blink like, ma'am, you live in my uterus rent free for nine months. Show some respect. Anyway, she decides she's going vegan. Great. I support her. I buy tofu, almond milk, overpriced plant nuggets that taste like regret, the whole shebang. Do I understand it? No. But I'm a supportive queen. But then one night it's 1:00am, I'm watching reality TV in the dark and I get hungry. I open the freezer and see those dino shaped chicken nuggets she begged for last year and never ate. So I pop like 4 in the air fryer. I'm minding my business, living my best life life. And guess what? I forget to hide the evidence. Next morning she walks into the kitchen, sniffs the air like a bloodhound and goes, did you eat meat in this house? I said, um, maybe. She gasps like I just committed war crimes. You ate dead animals while I was sleeping. I said, baby girl, they were shaped like Dinosaurs, they're barely meat. Calm down. She grabs her reusable water bottle, slams it on the counter and yells, this is why the planet's dying, mom, because of people like you who can't control their midnight cravings. I said, okay, Greta Thunberg, relax. She storms off to her room and text me from down the hall. We're not speaking. This is a betrayal. I text back, fine, more dino nuggets from. She leaves me on read y'all. Two weeks she wouldn't speak to me, not even when I stubbed my toe and screamed so loud the neighbors checked on me. She just walked past me with her Hydro flask and judgmental aura. But then get this, one day I come home early from work. I walk into the kitchen and there she is standing in front of the microwave holding a plate with three dino nuggets. She's caught midbite. We lock eyes, time freezes. She goes, they don't count if they're Dinosaur shaped. I said, excuse me. She wipes her mouth like a criminal and goes, don't tell dad. I said, oh, I'm telling everyone. She bribes me with her leftover Starbucks gift card and begs for mercy. I post the photo in our family group chat. Anyway, catch then our little activist caught mid murder. Her grandpa replied, meet runs in the family. Her uncle sent a Dinosaur emoji. Now she talks to me again, but only if I swear never to bring it up again. And in front Of her friends. So what do I do? Oh, I bring it up at every chance, especially when they start talking about saving the turtles. Because if you're gonna give me the silent treatment over dino nuggets, you better be ready for extinction level consequences.

I was valedictorian, full ride to Stanford. But all my stepfather could focus on was the empty seat where my biological father should have been sitting. After the ceremony, he pulled me aside behind the gymnasium. His face was red with that particular rage he reserved for moments when I reminded him that I wasn't his. You think you're so smart, he pissed, gripping my cap so hard the tassel snapped. Walking across that stage like you accomplished something, your real dad didn't even show up because deep down everyone knows what I know, you're worthless. Mom stood 20 feet away pretending not to see. She perfected that skill over the years. That night, drunk on wine and self importance, he left me a voicemail. I almost deleted it immediately. Instead, something made me save it. His slurred words about how college would humble me, how I'd come crawling back begging for his approval, how I'd never amount to anything without his guidance. Stanford was everything he said it wouldn't be. I thrived, made Dean's list every semester. By junior year, I was already being recruited by investment firms. During spring break of my senior year, I found my stepfather in his study surrounded by real estate magazines and architectural plans. He was obsessing over the same Victorian mansion that had been for sale in our town's historic district for Three years asking price was $2.8 million, completely beyond his reach as a middle management insurance adjuster. Someday, he told mom as I passed by, when my promotion comes through, this house represents everything I've worked for. He drive past it every weekend, slowing down to stare at the wrap around porch and turret windows. It consumed him the way some people obsess over celebrities. After graduation, I moved to New York. Within two years, I was making more money than my stepfather would see in a decade. I bought a penthouse in Manhattan, built a life he said I'd never have. But I kept thinking about that house. Last month, the Victorian was back on the market. The price had dropped to $2.4 million. I flew home that weekend and toured it with a realtor. Crown molding, original hardwood floors, a library with built in shelves reaching the ceiling. I could see why my stepfather had dreamed about it. I made an all cash offer that afternoon. The closing was scheduled for a Thursday. I drove to my mother's house afterward, the deed still warm in my hands. My stepfather was in his usual spot on the recliner watching cable news and complaining about mortgage rates. Remember that Victorian you always wanted, I asked casually. His head snapped up. The Whitmore house, what about it? I bought it today. The color drained from his face. Mom stopped folding.

Last month, I took my girlfriend Ebony to get knee surgery after she tore her ACL playing soccer. My mom insisted on coming to the hospital because she wanted to support Ebony. Ebony goes into surgery and everything goes fine. When she wakes up in recovery, she's completely loopy from the anesthesia. The nurse warns us she might be a little confused and say some strange things. My mom immediately perks up. Oh, this should be interesting. Ebony opens her eyes and sees me first. Jake, you're so handsome, like a beautiful potato. Thanks, babe. How are you feeling? I feel like I'm floating. Am I floating? Are we in space? My mom laughs. No, sweetie, you're in the hospital. Ebony turns to look at my mom and her eyes go wide. Oh, my God. It's Jake's mom. You're so pretty. You look like Jake but with better hair. My mom is eating this up. Thank you, Ebony. I have something really important to tell you, Ebony says. Seriously? What's that, honey? Ebony motions for my mom to come closer. Come here. I need to whisper something in your ear. My mom leans in, expecting some sweet anesthesia confession. Ebony cups her hands around my mom's ear like she's about to share a deep secret. And then, but it's not just any burp. It's the loudest, longest, most obnoxious burp I've ever heard. And somehow in the middle of This massive belch, Ebony manages to say, I hate you. So what my mom hears directly in her ear is burp. I hate you. My mom jumps back like she's been attacked. What? Ebony starts giggling hysterically. I got you. I got you. So good. Ebony. Did you just burp I hate you in my ear? Maybe. Did it work? I'm trying not to laugh because my mom looks horrified. Ebony, that's my mom. I know she's great. I love her. That's why I gave her my special burp. My mom is still processing. Your special burp? Yeah, it's how I show affection. Jake gets them all the time. That's that's how you show affection. Ebony nods enthusiastically. The louder the burp, the more I love you. And that was a really loud burp. My mom looks at me. Jake, is this true? I'm bright red. Ebony has a very a unique way of expressing herself. Ebony interrupts Mrs. Simon. Wanna hear my impression of a dying whale? Ebony? No, but Ebony is already making horrible groaning sounds. Oh, the nurse comes running in. Is everything okay? Ebony waves at her. Hi, I'm practicing whale sounds. Ebony starts making clicking sound. Click, click, click. I'm talking to dolphins, my mom whispers to me. Is she always like this? Only when she's heavily medicated. Ebony overhears Mrs. Simon. Did Jake tell you about the time I accidentally called his dad daddy at dinner? Ebony, what? It was funny. Your dad turned So red, my mom is trying not to laugh. You called my husband daddy. Yeah. And then I asked him if he wanted to adopt me. Ebony, can we not tell my mom every embarrassing story right now? But I have so many good ones. Like time you cried watching The Notebook. Everyone cries watching The Notebook. You cried for two hours and then you made me watch it again. My mom is definitely laughing now. Jake cried for two hours. Ebony nod. And he ate an entire pint of ice cream with his hands. His hands. He said spoons were too slow for his emotional needs. I want to disappear. Ebony, you're supposed to be resting. I am resting. I'm resting my mouth by talking. The nurse checks Ebony's vitals. How are you feeling? I feel great. I just burped in Jake's mom's ear and told her I hate her, but I really love her. The nurse looks confused. You burped what? Ebony demonstrates by making another loud burping sound like that, but with words inside. My mom shakes her head. I've never experienced anything like that. Missus Simon, want me to teach you? Ebony, please don't teach my mom how to burp words. Why not? You never know when you might need to burp. Communicate. Ebony turns back to my mom. Missus Simon, I have another secret to tell you. My mom hesitates. Are you going to burp in my ear again? No. This is a real secret. Come closer. My mom cautiously leans in. Ebony whispered, I'm going to marry your son. My mom's face lights up. Really? Yeah. But don't tell him I'm going to propose to him, Ebony. That's not how proposals usually work. Why not? I'm a modern woman. I can post my potato boyfriend. Potato boyfriend. Ebony looks at me lovingly. Yeah, he's my beautiful potato. My mom is crying from laughing. Ebony, you're delightful. Thank you. That's why I gave you my best burp. The anesthesia starts wearing off and Ebony gets sleepy. Mrs. Simon, will you visit me when I'm not high on drugs? Of course, sweetie. Good. Next time I'll teach you my burping alphabet.

It's pathetic. So I put a stop to our fake marriage. We've been married for five years and I thought I was being the perfect husband. I spent three hours cooking her favorite meal for our anniversary, set up candles, even dug out that playlist from our first date. When she walked through the door with her sister and best friend, she took one look at the setup, rolled her eyes and said loud enough for everyone to hear, stop trying to be romantic. It's pathetic. You look desperate. Then she turned to her friends. This is exactly what I was telling you about. He does this needy stuff constantly. The room went dead silent. Her sister looked uncomfortable. Her best friend stared at the floor. I stood there holding wine, watching my wife destroy our marriage with one sentence. I set the wine down, looked her straight in the eye and said, you know what, you're absolutely right. She expected me to apologize, to scramble. Instead, I started blowing out the candles. What are you doing? She asked, losing that confident edge. Stopping, I replied, gathering the flowers. Romance is pathetic when it's one sided. So I'm done being pathetic. I tossed the flowers in the trash and ordered pizza. We can eat like roommates from now on, pepperoni or cheese. That night she tried damage control, talking about bad days, overreacting. But something had shifted in me. I heard you. Perfectly, I told her. Message received. No more romantic gestures, no more pathetic behavior. She laughed it off. Maybe we both need to be more realistic about what marriage actually is. Those words would haunt her the next morning. I didn't bring her coffee in bed like I had every weekend for five years. When she came downstairs expecting her usual cup, I was finishing mine. Coffee's in the kitchen, I said. Without looking, I saw our marriage clearly for the first time. I was the one planning date nights she'd complain about. I was the one remembering anniversaries. I was the one keeping romance alive. When I stopped being romantic, I stopped with everything unnecessary. No more good morning kisses, no more asking about her day. No more caring where she went. By day 10, the cracks show. Are you going to ask me about my presentation? She said, clearly fishing. Do you want to tell me about it? Well, it went well, she said, waiting for follow up questions that never came. Good for you. I went back to my phone. She stood there for a full minute waiting for me to engage. When it became clear I wasn't playing that role anymore, she left without another word. Three weeks in, she was losing her mind. She mentioned male co workers talk about her ex reaching out, brought up how attentive other husbands were. Each comment was fishing for jealousy. Any sign I still cared. My response was Always. That's interesting. Then I'd return to whatever I was doing. I'd started hitting the gym, reading books, learn in guitar, something she'd always dismissed as a waste of time. One month in, she cracked. She was waiting at the kitchen table when I got home. Papers spread everywhere. We need to talk. You're punishing me because your feelings got hurt. My feelings got hurt. I repeated, you humiliated me in front of your friends. Called five years of romantic gesture.

And why is the ratio five days of pain to two days of peace? That's like ordering a pizza and only getting two slices. Because here's the thing. The weekend is not even a real weekend. Friday night is gone in a blink, Saturday doesn't even exist. It's more like catch up on chores day, and Sunday is finish all the homework you got day. Like, why do we even get homework? Is the weekend not supposed to be the week's end? Am I not supposed to rest? Meanwhile, school takes five whole days. Five. Imagine working five shifts at a job you never applied for. And the pay. See you again on Monday. Like, bro, at least jobs give you money. School gives you stress, exams, annoying teachers, and fire drills at 8:00am when it's freezing outside. Honestly, I wish we could flip it. Two days of school, five days of weekend. That's balance. That's peace. Until then, I'll be sitting in class every Monday wondering if dropping out is a spiritual call. No.

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy Robert looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let me guess, looking for a rich boyfriend? Smart girl. Lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colors are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interest in perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me, and continued his lecture. A Girl Like You probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do. Flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was Familiar with the artist's work. Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the pretty pictures doesn't count as being familiar with art, sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes from decades of study, not whatever you Learned from TikTok. Robert decided to test me. Rapid firing questions. Who's Basquiat? What's Kiara Scuro? Name three Renaissance painters besides Da Vinci. When I started to answer, he cut me off. Wrong. See this? This is why galleries shouldn't have open events. You probably googled some terms before coming here to impress men, but Riley here is working in a tradition you couldn't possibly understand without a proper education. Not community college, sweetie. Real universities. He returned to my painting, now explaining it louder to draw a crowd. What Riley has achieved here would cost probably 100,000 in education to even the materials alone cost more than you'd make in a month at whatever retail job you have. He looked at my outfit with disgust. Target clearance rack, right? Someone who shops there couldn't possibly grasp the investment in this piece. He probably spent more on one brush than your entire outfit. When I suggested the artist might be self taught, Robert sneered at me. Is that how you Learned about art? Painting parties? Robert grabbed my wrist, only to another angle, his grip too tight. You're too stupid to even stand in the right spot. Riley intended for this to be viewed from exactly here. Your ignorance is actually disrespectful to his work. He kept his hand on my wrist while explaining, though. Honestly, explaining this to you is like teaching calculus to a toddler. You lack the basic foundation to understand any of it. He noticed me trying to pull away and

My mom thought men were the cause of all evil. Ever since dad left us when I was 7. But that was years ago now. At 13, I had to wear this hideous shirt to school that said no boyfriends in three pink letters. She installed tracking apps, called during every free period, and even put a ring camera pointing at my bedroom window. But a small part of me understood why she was such a helicopter parent. We lived in a sketchy neighborhood. The first time I got cat called was on my eighth birthday. I was wearing a tutu skirt and with no man walking with us to protect us. We both got harassed by men all the time. So I could kind of see why she hated the male species so much. But here's the thing. All her rules didn't stop the harassment. They just made me an easier target. A girl walking alone, obviously without a boyfriend, practically wearing a sign that said vulnerable. That's when I met him. This guy from my chemistry class who noticed me speed walking past the bad corner one day, keys between my fingers, like mom taught me. Hey! He called out, you okay? I kept walking. Stranger danger and all that, but he persisted. I lived two blocks over. We could walk together. Mom's voice echoed in my head. That's how it starts. So I said no, practically ran away. But I noticed Him after that? Always seemed to be around when I was walking home. This went on for weeks. Until the day everything changed. One day, three guys started following me. My heart hammered as I fumbled for my phone. Then chemistry boy appeared. Just walked right up and put his arm around me. Hey, babe. Sorry I'm late. The guys backed off. Immediately. After they left, he dropped his arm. You good? When I nodded, he said something that made my skin prickle. I don't like you walking alone. Sweet or possessive? I couldn't tell. But either way, I was more scared of those three guys than him. So when he offered again, I finally said yes. Walks became a secret thing. Chemistry boy knew my whole schedule. Always texted home safe if he couldn't walk with me. Started teaching me self defense moves in the park. His hands adjusting my stance, showing me how to break a grip. Every girl should know this stuff, he said. But Mom's words never left my mind. Predators like to establish control. He'd appear at weird times. Just happened to be in the area. Sure. Once I joked about him following me, and his face went serious. I noticed things like that car that's been parked outside your house. I could have run then. Instead, I kept meeting him. Mom almost caught us once. I was in the middle of showing him where I lived. But I know when my mom's car turned The corner early. He practically dove behind a dumpster. My heart pounded as mom pulled up. Who are you talking to? Nobody. Just on the phone. I thought I was being so clever, sneaking around her rules. Turns out someone else was sneaking around, too, because a few days later, our neighbor, Mrs. Doyle, got robbed in broad daylight by someone who knew exactly when she'd be alone. The cop said mom went nuclear. It's always someone they trusted, someone who Learned their routine. She stared at me hard. You haven't been talking to any boys, right? I lied through my teeth while my phone buzzed. Another home safe text. Mystery Boy texted a lot. Like, a lot. Always asking where I was, who I was with. Once I didn't respond for an hour, and he showed up at the library looking panicked. Just worried, he said. Well, three weeks and two more neighborhood break ins later, I decided having him around was better than being alone. On days when my mom worked later, he'd sit in my closet doing homework while I kept watch. This is insane. Yeah, no kidding. Everything came crashing down on a Thursday. Mom came home early with a migraine. I barely got him in the closet before she walked in. Just gonna lie down, she said, heading to her room. He was trapped. My phone lit up with his text. Still in here? No sheet, Sherlock. That's when I heard it. Glass breaking downstairs. My whole body went ice cold. Mom appeared in my doorway, face white. Did you hear that? We froze as footsteps creaked on the stairs. Heavy, deliberate. Mom's eyes went wide. She mouth 9 1 1, but her phone was downstairs in her purse. Mine was dead. The foot steps got closer. My 4 eleven. Mom pushed me behind her, grabbing my field hockey stick. The door swung open. A man in a ski mask stood there, knife glinting. Mom swung the stick, but he caught it, yanked it away, shoved her heart into the wall. I screamed. The closet door exploded open.

My mom thought men were the cause of all evil ever since dad left us when I was 7. But that was years ago. Now at 13, I had to wear this hideous shirt to school that said no boyfriends in three pink letters. She installed tracking apps, called during every free period and even put a ring camera pointing at my bedroom window. But a small part of me understood why she was such a helicopter parent. We lived in a sketchy neighbourhood. The first time I got cat called was on my 8th birthday. I was wearing a tutu skirt and with no man walking with us to protect us, we both got harassed by men all the time. So I could kind of see why she hated the male species so much. But here's the thing, all her rules didn't stop the harassment. They just made me an easier target. A girl walking alone, obviously without a boyfriend, practically wearing a sign that said vulnerable. That's when I met him. This guy from my chemistry class who noticed me speed walking past the bad corner one day, keys between my fingers like mom taught me. Hey, he called out, you okay? I kept walking. Stranger danger and all that. But he persisted. I live two blocks over. We could walk together. Mom's voice echoed in my head. That's how it starts. So I said no, practically ran away. But I noticed Him after that always seemed to be around when I was walking home. This went on for weeks until the day everything changed. One day, three guys started following me. My heart hammered as I fumbled for my phone. Then chemistry boy appeared. Just walked right up and put his arm around me. Hey, babe, sorry I'm late. The guys backed off immediately after they left. He dropped his arm. You good? When I nodded, he said something that made my skin prickle. I don't like you walking alone. Sweet or possessive? I couldn't tell. But either way, I was more scared of those three guys than him. So when he offered again, I finally said yes. Walks became a secret thing. Chemistry boy knew my whole schedule, always texted home safe if he couldn't walk with me. Started teaching me self defense moves in the park. His hands adjusting my stance, showing me how to break a grip. Every girl should know this stuff, he said. But Mom's words never left my mind. Predators like to establish control. He'd appear at weird times. Just happened to be in the area. Sure. Once I joked about him following me and his face went serious. I noticed things like that car that's been parked outside your house. I could have run then. Instead, I kept meeting him. Mom almost caught us once. I was in the middle of showing him where I lived. But I know when my mom's car turned The corner early. He practically dove behind a dumpster. My heart pounded as mom pulled up. Who are you talking to? Nobody. Just on the phone. I thought I was being so clever, sneaking around her rules. Turns out someone else was sneaking around too, because a few days later, our neighbor, Mrs. Doyle, got robbed in broad daylight by someone who knew exactly when she'd be alone. The cop said mom went nuclear. It's always someone they trusted, someone who Learned their routine. She stared at me hard. You haven't been talking to any boys, right? I lied through my teeth while my phone buzzed. Another home safe text. Mystery boy texted a lot. Like a lot. Always asking where I was, who I was with. Once I didn't respond for an hour and he showed up at the library looking panicked, just worried. He said, well, 3 weeks and two more neighborhood break ins later, I decided having him around was better than being alone. On days when my mom worked later, he'd sit in my closet doing homework while I kept watch. This is insane. Yeah, no kidding. Everything came crashing down on a Thursday. Mom came home early with a migraine. I barely got him in the closet before she walked in. Just gonna lie down, she said. Heading to her room. He was trapped. My phone lit up with his text, still in here. No sheet, Sherlock. That's when I heard it. Glass breaking downstairs. My whole body went ice cold. Mom appeared in my doorway, face white. Did you hear that? We froze as footsteps creaked on the stairs, heavy, deliberate. Mom's eyes went wide. She mouth 9, 1, 1. But her phone was downstairs in her purse. Mine was dead. The foot steps got closer. My 4, 11. Mom pushed me behind her, grabbing my field hockey stick. The door swung open. A man in a ski mask stood there, knife glinting. Mom swung the stick, but he caught it, yanked it away, shoved her heart into the wall. I screamed. The closet door exploded open. Chemistry boy launched himself at the intruder using those same moves he taught me. They crashed into the hallway. Call 9, 1, 1, he yelled.

How has it gone for you? When my wife Rachel and I adopted Devon at six years old, they told us she had mild trust issues. What they didn't tell us was that she'd been returned by three families already. Devon showed up at our house with one tiny suitcase and a backpack that first night. I watched her through the doorway as she carefully laid out all her clothes on the bed. She folded each piece perfectly, put it back in the suitcase, and zipped it up. Then she slept on top of the covers, fully dressed. I thought maybe she was just nervous, but weeks went by, and that suitcase never got unpacked. We take out one outfit each morning, wear it all day, then fold it back up at night. Her closet stayed completely empty. Rachel tried everything. New sheets with unicorns on them, a night light shaped like a butterfly. We even let her pick out paint for her room walls. He chose white. Just plain white like before. One morning, I found her in the kitchen at 5 a m. Making her own breakfast. Toast with no butter. Just dry bread. When I asked why she was up so early, she said, I didn't want to bother you guys. Sometimes people get mad when kids wake them up. That broke my heart. Rachel and I had been trying for years to have kids. We dreamed About Saturday morning pancakes and bedtime stories. But Devin acted like she was living in a hotel, not a home. The real wake up call came three months later. I got home from work and heard crying upstairs. I found Devon sitting on her bed, holding that stupid suitcase in her lap. What's wrong, sweetheart? She looked up at me with these huge brown eyes and said, I heard you and Rachel fighting last night about money. I know kids cost a lot. I can go back to Miss Janet tomorrow if you want. Miss Janet was her social worker. My throat got tight. Rachel and I had been arguing about our car payment. Nothing to do with Devon at all. Devon, we weren't fighting about you. We love having you here. She just shrugged. That's what the Johnson said, too. And the Millers. They all said I was special. Until I wasn't anymore. That night, Rachel and I sat up talking until 3 a m. We realized Devon wasn't just scared of us leaving her. She was waiting for us to leave her. She'd been through this routine before. Nice family, happy faces. Then back to foster care. When things got tough the next day, I had an idea. I went to the hardware store and bought the biggest picture frame they had, like three feet wide. Then Rachel and I spent the whole weekend taking photos. Devon at breakfast, Devon watching TV, Devon playing with our dog, Charlie. Just normal, boring family stuff. We printed out all the pictures and arranged them in the frame. Beach trips we took her on. Movie nights on the couch. Devon's first day at her new school. Even the bad pictures where someone was making a weird face. When Devon got home from school Monday, we called her into the living room.

It's 7:00am. I'm still half asleep with coffee when my daughter bust into the bathroom like the FBI. She's holding her underwear up like a bloody flag and screaming, mom, I'm leaking from the wrong end! I'm gonna die! I nearly spit coffee everywhere. I say, sweetheart, calm down. That's just your period. She freezes, squints at me and yells, you liar! I knew you made that story up few months ago. I actually explained this whole thing Saturday down. Gave her the talk, showed her pictures. She rolled her eyes and said, nice prank, mom. You really think I'm that dumb? Now she's standing here like I faked the whole biology system just to mess with her. She stomps her foot. So you mean to tell me women eat every month and just go to target like nothing happened? She's pacing, yelling, you could have stopped this! You're my mom, not my enemy! I hand her a pad. She picks it up with two fingers like it's radioactive. This is a diaper. You want me to wear a diaper to school? Kids already bully me for my Lunchables. If I sound like a Doritos bag when I walk, I'm done. She sticks it on, takes two steps. Crunch, crunch! She stops, dead serious. Perfect. Now I'm Miss Fritos. Then she whispers, wait, does dad get this, too? I almost choked on my coffee. No, baby, only girls! She screams. Figures. Men don't do anything. They just fart and watch football while we bleed like stabbed pumpkins. She comes home from school later, furious. Mom, you didn't warn me the pad sticks to your leg hair. I was in that stall fighting for my life. People thought I was wrestling a raccoon. Then she adds, and when I sneezed in math, I thought my kidney fell out. Thanks, mom. Now they call me Leaky Lindsay. That night, she's on the couch, blanket eating pad, hot Cheetos in her lap, looking like a soldier who saw combat. She points at her brother and yells, enjoy your balls, loser! My. This is literally trying to kill me. He cried into his Pop Tarts. Next morning, she tries to get out of chores. Mom, I can't clean. My uterus is in critical condition. I say, nope. She glares at me, wow, you're a woman, too? And you still betrayed me. You're basically a war criminal. At dinner, my husband's carving chicken. It's calm. Suddenly, she stands up, bangs her glass with a fork, and goes, ladies and gentlemen, I am now a woman. My uterus has joined the group chat. Please clap. My husband choked on a drumstick. My son screamed, gross! And ran upstairs. And the grand finale. She whips out a Sharpie, lifts her shirt, and across her stomach she's written in giant letters, congrats, dad! You're next! I nearly passed out laughing. My husband dropped his fork like he saw a Ghost! My son slammed his door, and my daughter, she just sat back down, grabbed mashed potatoes with her hands, and goes. Period season has officially started, bitches.

It started when my sister Chloe came home crying because her boyfriend Jake dumped her. She's 25 and I'm 17, but she always acts like she's the victim in every situation. This time was different, though. She kept saying Jake was horrible and cruel. But when I asked what happened, she got all shifty. He said he broke up with her out of nowhere and kicked her out of his apartment. But then she mentioned she still had keys to his place because she forgot to give them back. The next day, she left early in the morning and came back with this huge golden retriever. I recognized him immediately. It was Buster, Jake's dog. Love that dog more than anything. When his grandpa died last year, Buster was the only thing that helped him through it. I asked Chloe why she had Buster, and she got this weird smile on her face. She said Jake didn't deserve to keep him since he broke her heart. Then she said something that made my stomach drop. She told me she was going to take Buster to the vet tomorrow to put him down as payback for what Jake did to her. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This dog was completely healthy and happy, just confused about being in a new place. Buster kept looking around for Jake and whining by the door. It was heartbreaking. I Told Chloe she was being insane and she couldn't just kill someone's dog because she was upset. She laughed and said Jake should have thought about that before he decided to hurt her. Then she said if I told anyone, she'd make sure I regretted it. That night I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about Buster and how scared he must be. Around 2:00am, I heard Chloe on the phone with someone, probably making the vet appointment. I knew I had to do something. Then next morning, Chloe left for work and told mom she was taking Buster for a walk later. Mom didn't know the whole story. Chloe just said Jake asked her to watch his dog for a few days. As soon as both then were gone, I called Jake. He picked up on the first ring and sounded terrible. I told him Chloe had Buster and was planning to put him down today. He went completely silent for like 10 seconds, then started freaking out. He said he'd been looking everywhere for Buster and thought maybe he got out somehow. I told Jake to come over now while Chloe was at work. He was at our house in 15 minutes. When he saw Buster, he literally started crying. Buster went crazy with excitement, jumping all over him and licking his face. I opened the door and Jake carried his dog out to his car. Before he left, Jake told me what really happened with Chloe. She didn't Just get dumped. She cheated on him with his best friend, Marcus. When Jake found out, he broke up with her and told her to move out. She stole Buster on her way out and left Jake's spare key on the counter so he thought she was being mature about the breakup. A few hours later, Chloe came home and went straight to look for Buster. When she couldn't find him, she started screaming my name. She found me in my room and absolutely lost it. She called me a traitor and said I had no right to interfere in her business. Then mom came home and asked what all the yelling was about. Chloe told her I let some guy steal her dog. She made it sound like I just gave away her pet to a random stranger. Mom looked

My 6 year old nephew absolutely destroyed my sister at Thanksgiving dinner. And honestly, she deserved it. My sister Emma has always been obsessed with appearances, perfect makeup, designer clothes, constantly taking selfies. She's the type who spends two hours getting ready just to go to target. At family dinners, she'd always make these passive aggressive comments about everyone else's life choices. So we're all sitting around the table Last Thanksgiving. Emma shows up an hour late because she had to get her nails done. She's wearing this ridiculous white dress to a family dinner where we're eating gravy and cranberry sauce. Classic Emma move. She immediately starts her usual routine, comments about how Mom's stuffing has too much salt this year, mentions how Uncle Rick should probably lay off the dinner rolls, makes this big show of only eating tiny portions because she's watching her figure. Then she turns to my brother Jake, who just started community college. So Jake, still taking those little classes. When are you going to get a real degree? Jake just stared at his plate. The kids working two jobs to pay for school. Emma kept going. She asked my cousin about her starter apartment and wondered when she'd get a grown up job. She even made a comment about dad's old truck in the driveway saying it was embarrassing. The whole time my nephew Tyler was just sitting there eating his Turkey. And watching Tyler's, Jake's 6 year old son, super quiet kid, usually just plays with his food and doesn't say much during adult conversations. Emma was on a roll. She started talking about her new boyfriend's BMW and how they're looking at condos downtown, really laying it on thick about how successful she is compared to everyone else. Then she made her biggest mistake. She looked at Tyler and said, Tyler, sweetie, make sure you study hard in school so you don't end up like your daddy. Okay? The table went dead silent. Jake's face turned red. Mom literally gasped. Dad put down his fork and just stared at Emma. But Tyler. Tyler just looked up from his mashed potatoes, blinked those big innocent eyes and said in the sweetest voice ever, Aunt Emma, why?

Like the other day I'm hanging at my friend's place after school, but dude has the appetite of a hummingbird, one granola bar and he's full. And I don't wanna ask for food at his house. I want him to offer like a normal human. So I start dropping hints. A McDonald's commercial comes on and I'm like, dang, a Mcchicken would go crazy right now. Then I get up to grab a glass of water and stare into the fridge like I'm touring an art museum. I even ask, yo, do you guys ever do pizza rolls here or. Nah. He just shrugs and says, I'm not really hungry. Oh, ask about you. But then when he finally picks up on the hint, instead of having his mom make us a snack, he just leans toward the kitchen and yells, mom dog is hungry. Can you make him something? Like, bro, oh, why would you say it like that? Now she either thinks my parents don't feed me at home or I'm a big back here to clear out her fridge.

But here's the problem scrolling through hashtags at 2:00am is not the same thing as a professional evaluation. Google is not your therapist. ID Labs tests are not your psychiatrist. And that one influencer who talks about their symptoms in a story time? Definitely not a doctor. When everyone just casually slaps a label on themselves, it waters down the real struggles people actually face. Like someone living with legit OCD is out here battling life every day and then some dude is like oh my god I'm so OCD I color code my closet. No, you're not OCD. You're just organized my guy. And even with depression, just because you're feeling a little sad one week does not mean you have depression. Unless you're diagnosed, I don't wanna hear it. You're free to self pity in private, but self diagnosing is probably one of the most selfish and attention seeking things you can do. Faith out.

My stupid ass woke up, shook his head, and then fell back asleep. Who the fuck does that? And the crazy thing about it too is that I don't even remember any of these things happening, and all I remember is waking up at 2 p. M. With one sock on my right foot. Like, what the hell just happened? And what makes this shit even worse is that I have to open up Snapchat and Instagram. I gotta see these chocolate at my school talking about some bullshit. Like guys, I'm actually excited to start school again. And who's in my class? Shut the fuck up talking about I Miss school so much. How you already pre glazing the teachers? You haven't even met him yet. Man. Can't wait to get back into academia and pursue my academic prowess. Like god damn bro zip it up when you're done. Like guys, I'm low key realizing now that I haven't improved a single bit through this summer. My fits didn't get tougher, I didn't get a glow up, I didn't really lose weight. Fam, I'm the exact same motherfucker who they saw get sent to OAC. Nothing changed about me. I actually can't do this anymore man. There's no way. School starting in two days bro. I'm so fucked. Baked, deep fried, literally everything under the sun that I could be right now. I am and there's no way I'm gonna make it on school on time bro. I genuinely think there's something wrong with me man cause I'm going to bed when school starts and waking up when school ends. Man this has to be some sort of joke. It's like my body is telling me ha fuck you man. Figure it out. Like god damn man I thought we were a team so I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm just gonna have to try and figure it out. So uh.

I gotta say this because it's been sitting on my chest. Nobody, and I mean nobody, should be celebrating Charlie Kirk's death. And before anybody gets mad at me, hear me out. I don't care if you hated what he stood for. I don't care if you never agreed with a single thing that came out of his mouth. There's a difference between disagreeing with someone and actually cheering when they're gone. Like, do you realize how weird that is? A man just lost his life, and the first instinct some people have is to make jokes, memes, clap, emojis, little he deserved it comments, bro. That's not activism. That's not standing for what you believe in. That's just heartless. And let's not forget, behind all the politics, behind all the headlines, there's a real family sitting there grieving. There's a wife who just lost her husband. There's kids who just lost their dad. Imagine being them, scrolling online and seeing people laugh about it. That doesn't make you powerful. It doesn't make you woke. It makes you cold. Here's the bigger picture. When you start normalizing this energy, when you start clapping every time somebody you don't like goes down, you're not actually winning anything. You're just feeding into the same negativity you claim to be against. You're lowering the bar of empathy until there's nothing left. And what happens then? Everyone's just waiting for the next tragedy to entertain them. That's not society. That's just chaos. You can hate his views, you can call out his words, you can spend your whole life disagreeing with the man. That's fine. That's human. But death is bigger than politics. Death is bigger than arguments. And if we really want the world to be a better place, maybe it starts with not cheering when someone's gone. So, yeah, nobody should be celebrating Charlie Kirk's death. You don't gotta like him, but at least respect life. Because if you lose that, if you can't even respect the finality of death, then, honestly, what does that say about you?

When I tried to correct my stepdaughter, I just smiled and said, alright. I'm Brandon, 38 and married to Samantha for three years. She has twin 12 year olds from her first marriage, Charlotte and Aiden. Their dad sends birthday cards twice a year if we're lucky. Last Tuesday, I caught Charlotte stealing 20 bucks from Samantha's purse. When I confronted her, she rolled her eyes and said, you're not my real dad. You can't tell me what to do. I calmly told Samantha what happened. Instead of addressing the theft, she got defensive. Don't lecture my kids about money. If you want a parent so badly, get your own children. That's dumb. But I just smiled and said, alright. See, what Samantha didn't know was that I've been covering their car insurance, phone bills and school supplies for months. While she struggled with debt, I'd also been quietly setting aside college funds for both kids, $400 a month each in the savings accounts they didn't even know existed. The next morning, I canceled everything. Car insurance, gone. Phone plan, terminated. The college accounts I'd open, closed and transferred to my personal savings. I also stopped buying groceries. No more weekly 200 dollar trips to keep the pantry stocked. No more paying for their Netflix, Spotify or Charlotte's dance classes that cost me $150 a month. Aiden soccer registration fees, not my problem anymore. I even canceled the family gym. Membership and stopped paying for their school lunches. Every subscription, every monthly payment, every little expense I've been quietly handling, all of it gone. When Charlotte's phone got shut off at school and she couldn't call her friends, she came home furious. Why isn't my phone working? Ask your mom, I said, not looking up from my laptop. Aiden couldn't get picked up from soccer practice because the car insurance had lapsed and Samantha's registration was expired. She had to leave work early, costing her overtime pay she desperately needed. That evening, Samantha panicked when she opened the fridge to find it nearly empty. The pantry was bare except for some stale crackers and a can of beans. Where's all the food? What happened to everything? She demanded, hands shaking as she looked at the empty shelf.

Me and my older brother Nate were best friends growing up. He was everything I wanted to be, tough, protective, always getting me out of trouble. When I messed up, when I broke Mrs. Wilson's window playing baseball, Nate took the blame and got grounded for two weeks. When I failed my math test, spent hours helping me study for the retake. We shared everything, our tiny bedroom, video games, even a fake ID when we got to college, our parents died in a car crash when I was 15. The whole world felt like it was ending. But Nate stepped up immediately. He was only 22, barely an adult himself, but he became my legal guardian without hesitation. He dropped out of his senior year, got two jobs, working at a warehouse during the day and cleaning offices at night. I never heard him complain once. He'd come home exhausted, covered in sweat and dust, but still help me with homework. When other kids got allowances, Nate made sure I had lunch money. When I wanted new sneakers, he worked overtime to get them. He never made me feel like a burden, even though I knew I was draining every penny he earned. I graduated high school with decent grades and got into State College. Nate was so proud. He cried at my graduation, said our parents would have been proud, too. He kept working those same two jobs to pay my Tuition, living off ramen noodles and hope. I promised him someday I'd pay him back for everything. Four years later, I landed a good job at an accounting firm, finally making real money. First thing I did was try to give Nate cash, but he refused, said seeing me succeed was payment enough. That's just how he was, never wanted anything for himself. Last Thanksgiving, I brought my fiance, Emma, home to meet him. She'd heard all my stories about my amazing big brother who raised me. They got along great, laughing at old photos, Nate telling embarrassing stories about when I was little. Everything felt perfect. Later that night, after Emma went to bed, Nate asked me to sit down. He looked nervous, fidgeting with his coffee cup like he used to do when we were kids. And he had something serious to tell me.

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently and just her school clothes, no coat, tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out, he said. I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up feeling how ice cold her little body was and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key, Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected, sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning. I told her actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's Pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me, nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter. Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever, but I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years, the man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me. He picked Up phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear, from rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialed a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine. It's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed six months ago? File everything tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my.

We're done being your servants, mom announced, slapping a contract on the kitchen table I'd scrubbed an hour ago. This says that you will do exactly 50% of all household chores. Sign it. She started recording on her phone while dad stood behind her, arms crossed. We're exhausted from carrying you. The irony was incredible. I been doing way more than 50% of everything for two years. While they couldn't even tell you where we kept the laundry detergent. Mom hadn't cooked since 2022. Dad hadn't touched a vacuum in forever. Yet they genuinely believe they were doing most of the housework. 50% or find somewhere else to live, dad added, wearing the shirt I'd ironed that morning. I looked at the contract, then at their smug faces, then I signed it with a smile. You're absolutely right, 50% starting tomorrow. I promise I'll never do more than my exact share again. They actually high five each other like they'd just won a free slave in the lottery, realising their problems were about to skyrocket. The next morning, mom was on the phone with her sister at 6:00am, bragging about their breakthrough in parenting. We finally taught him responsibility, she gloated. Kids these days need firm boundaries, dad chimed in from the bathroom. Should have done this years ago. Watch how smooth everything runs now that he knows we mean business. They moved through their morning routine with the confidence of people who never had to think about clean clothes magically appearing in their closets or lunches mysteriously packing themselves. That's when I decided to follow exactly what the contract said. Twenty minutes later, I started the laundry and pulled my clothes out mid cycle, leaving the machine full of soapy water. Dad discovered his work shirts floating in cold gray water at 7:00am, his confident whistling dying mid note as he started screaming from the laundry room. He he missed his critical client meeting trying to dry a shirt with Mom's hair dryer still damp, patches visible during his afternoon presentation. Mom fared no better. She'd assumed her presentation outfit would be clean as always, only to find it buried under a week of their dirty clothes. She did her zoom presentation to corporate in a wrinkled gym shirt, her credibility evaporating as quickly as her promotion chances. By Wednesday, the house reeked, taking out exactly one trash bag, mine, leaving theirs to ferment in the summer heat. When Mom's book club arrived, I watched from my spotless half of the living room as her best friend's face contorted at the smell. We're doing exactly fifty. Fifty now, I explained cheerfully, showing them Mom's recorded contract. She was very insistent about fairness. The women exchanged glances before suddenly remembering other commitments. Mom's smile cracked like old paint. Real collapse came Friday when Dad's boss arrived for dinner. I'd vacuumed exactly Half of each room, leaving a perfect line down the middle like a bizarre art installation. The dining table was set only on my side, where I sat eating takeout while dad frantically tried to explain why half their home looked abandoned. Where's the food? Dad hissed in the kitchen. I only bought my half of groceries. Cooking for others would exceed my share, I called out loud enough for his boss to hear. The man left after 15 minutes muttering about family issues. When they realized they'd messed up, they attempted gaslighting me into going back to how things were. You're being deliberately difficult, mom accused during another family meeting. This isn't what we meant, and you know it. I pulled out my phone, playing back her video from the first meeting. You said, and I quote, exactly 50% of all household chores. No more free rides. I have spreadsheets showing I'm doing precisely 50%. Dad tried a different angle. You're supposed to be mature enough to understand what we really meant. Oh, so you meant I should read your minds instead of following the written contract you made me sign. They went silent, awkwardly avoiding my eyes. They couldn't exactly scold me about doing exactly what they wanted me to do, but their friends started joking about the 50% house. At social gatherings, they cracked. Please just go back to how things were before, mom begged. We didn't realize you were doing so much, dad nodded frantically. We'll Rip up the contract. Just please clean the bathroom properly. My boss is coming for dinner tomorrow. I leaned back in my chair, savoring the moment. Actually, I'm really enjoying this new system. It's given me so much more time for studying, and my grades have never been better. Plus, you were right, 50% is much fairer than what I was doing before. The panic in their eyes was palpable.

I was in Mr Aneta's history class when the announcement came over the intercom. Code Red. Code red. This is not a drill. Everyone froze. We practiced this 100 times. Lock the door. Turn off the lights. Hide in the corner. Mr Grenada immediately jumped up and reached for the door lock. Then Vice Principal Medina's voice boomed through the speaker. False alarm, everyone. Some pranksters called in a fake threat. Continue with your lessons. Do not lock your doors. I repeat, do not initiate lockdown procedures. Mr Grenada hesitated with his hand on the lock. My friend Maddie whispered from her desk. I said, Code Red, that's the real signal. Mr Aneta looked confused. The VP says it's fake, though. Then we heard it, footsteps running down the hallway, not walking, running hard and fast like someone was being chased. Mr Medina's voice came back on. Teachers, I said, continue teaching. Any classroom that locks their door will have their teacher written up for insubordination. Mr Arneta slowly backed away from the door. He looked scared but sat back at it desk. Everyone stay calm. Let's continue with the lesson. Sweat was dripping from his forehead and nobody could focus. The running footsteps kept happening, first on our floor, then above us and back again. pulled out my phone and opened our school's parent Facebook group. My mom had posted that police were surrounding the School. They told us someone called about a weapon. She spammed my phone saying she loves me. My hands started shaking. I showed Maddie the post. Her face went white. She raised her hand. Mr Aneta, my mom says the police are outside. Mr Aneta walked to the window and peeked through the blinds. He gasped loudly. There were six police cars in the parking lot. Mr Medina came on again. Students ignore any social media posts. This is a routine false alarm. Any student caught on their phone will receive immediate suspension. Any teacher who initiates lockdown will be terminated. I saw Mr Aneta's jaw clench. We could hear doors slamming somewhere in the building, not closing, slamming like someone was checking rooms. Then we heard something that made everyone freeze. The fire exit at the end of our hallway opened and slammed shut. Someone was on our floor. Maddie grabbed my arm so tight it hurt. The footsteps were getting closer, classroom by classroom. Mr Grenada stood up and walked toward the door again, but he stopped. He looked at us and at the door and back at us. The footsteps stopped right outside our room. That's when Pete, the quiet kid who never talked, stood up. He grabbed his desk and started dragging it toward the door. Mr Anetta, help me now. Mr Anetta snapped out of it. What are you doing? Pete didn't stop. My dad's a cop, he said. If we ever hear Code Red, We lock down no matter what anyone says, even the principal. The door knob started to turn. Everyone moved at once. Kids grabbed desks and chairs and shoved them against the door. Mr Anetta finally joined us. Lights, someone get the lights. Maddie hit the switch. We pushed everything we could find against that door. The person outside pushed hard. The door opened a crack, but hit our barricade. They put harder. Mr Medina's voice screamed through the intercom, which classroom is refusing to follow directions? You will all be expelled. But we didn't care about his threats anymore. The person outside kicked the door. The whole barricade shook. Some girls started crying. Pete pointed to the back.

Like for real? A few days ago I tried this new feature they dropped where TikTok literally picks a song for your photo automatically. Sounds kind of cute, right? So I'm like, okay, let me just try it. I hit that little plus sign at the bottom, snapped a quick selfie, smiling and chill. No big deal. Then TikTok picks a song for me and it's Adele's Someone Like You. I was like, wait, what? I literally just woke up, was feeling cute, and TikTok's out here making it seem like I'm going through a breakup or something. So of course I had to try again. This time I took a pic of my cat just sleeping, all peaceful and cozy. Guess what song TikTok gave me? Megan, thee Stallion. Savage. Now my cat's out here being a whole bad bitch. Like what's going on TikTok? My friend tried it too. She took a pic of her breakfast, some toast and eggs, all cute and simple, and TikTok gave her unholy. At this point I'm seriously wondering if this app has psychic powers. It's not just matching songs to photos, it's like reading right through your soul. Now every morning I'm like, okay, what moods TikTok gonna give me today? I snap a pic and wait for the app to tell me how I'm feeling with a song. Y'all gotta try this. Take any pic, let TikTok pick your vibe. Then Come back and tell me what song it gave you. Because honestly, I need to know if I'm the only one getting mind read by TikTok

I stared in shock. What basement? I'm giving birth at the hospital. Oh, honey, Agnes said, reaching across the table to pat my hand. women have been delivering babies at home for five generations. I delivered Brent and his sisters right here in this house. My husband Brent squeezed my shoulder. Mom's delivered over 20 babies for our family. She knows what she's doing. The baby kicked hard against my ribs like it was trying to escape this conversation. We've been living in Brent's childhood home while our house underwent renovations. Not once had anyone mentioned this family tradition. I already have an OB, I said, my voice shaking. We've been planning a hospital birth. I'm high risk because of my blood pressure. Agnes waved her hand dismissively. Hospitals are where people go to die. Your own mother died giving birth in one of those places. The words hit me like a physical blow. My mother had died from complications, my birth. Brad followed me to our bedroom later that night. I was shoving clothes into my overnight bag when he grabbed my wrist. You're overreacting, he said. This is how my family does things. I'm not giving birth in some basement room with your mother playing doctor. His face hardened in a way I've never seen before. If you can't respect our traditions, Then maybe this marriage was a mistake. I froze. You're threatening divorce because I want actual medical care. He showed me our prenup clause 15. In case of divorce due to irreconcilable differences about family values, you forfeit custody rights. My legs went weak. I sank onto the bed. I had no money of my own, no family since my father died last year. Without Brent, I'd lose everything, including my baby. The next weeks became a waking nightmare. Agnes started her preparations, which included drinking foul smelling teas and attending birthing circles with other women from their community. During one session, a woman named Carol pulled me aside. My sister died during one of Agnes's home births five years ago, she whispered. They said it was God's will, but she bled out while Agnes refused to call an ambulance. My blood turned to ice that night. I searched online for anything about the Mitchell family. Three women had died during home births in this county over the past 15 years. Agnes's name was never mentioned, but the address. This were all in this neighborhood. The headache started the following week. My vision blurred and my feet swelled so badly I couldn't wear shoes, classic signs of preclampsia. When I told Agnes, she gave me more herbs and said hospital monitoring would just stress them, baby. She took my phone the next day, said I was reading too many scary stories online. Brent agreed it was for the best. I Waited until Agnes left for her weekly grocery run and snuck to the neighbor's house. I called my old colleague who worked as a labor and delivery nurse. You need to get to a hospital now, she said, after I described my symptoms. You could have a stroke or seizure. The baby could die. I can't, I sobbed. I'll lose custody if I leave. You'll lose your life if you stay. That night at dinner, I showed Brent the information she had texted. For the first time, I saw doubt cross his face. Maybe we should just get you checked, he said quietly, just to be safe. Agnes slammed her hand on the table. Absolutely not. Doubt is what kills mothers and babies. Faith is what saves them. But Brent held firm. We'll go tomorrow morning just for a quick check up. I never made it to morning. The contraction started at 2:00am, five weeks early. Brent ran for his keys, but Agnes had already taken them. She locked the doors from the inside with keys only she had. This is meant to be, she said, only as I doubled over in pain. The baby knows when it's time. Brent pounded on the doors, tried to break windows, but Agnes had prepared for this. Security bars on everything. No phones, no landline in our room. She LED me to the basement where her birthing room waited. Ancient equipment that belonged in a museum, stained sheets, the smell of old blood. Poorly masked by incense. As the contractions intensified, I heard Agnes on an old rotary phone in the corner. Yes, the policy is.

They already sliding across the room, locking in with their besties, acting like they rehearsed it. And me, I'm just sitting there fake smiling, pretending I'm not slowly panicking inside. You try to play it cool, looking around casually, acting like you're just taking your time. Deep down you're screaming, please, somebody make eye contact with me. And somehow everyone just knows how to avoid you. Like your whole class became trained professionals and not seeing you. It's like they went blind with precision. You shift in your seat a little, do that awkward cough like, hey, I'm still here. Nothing. Then the teacher hits you with the, oh, looks like you don't have a partner. Thanks for announcing it to the entire room, Mrs. Ava. Why not just put me under a spotlight and cue the sad violin while you're at it? And the worst part, the teacher sees it, oh, you don't have a partner. Hmm. Okay, just join that group over there, bro. That group already teamed up, planned the project, probably already gave each other nicknames and now I gotta slide in like the substitute friend. It's always the quiet group too. So now we're all just awkwardly pretending to be okay while not saying a single word at that point. I'm like, you know what, I'll work alone. I'll suffer in silence. At least I don't gotta ask someone if I can use their glue stick. And don't even get me started on when the teacher just assigns you to the one person in class you don't get along with. Now y'all gotta pretend to be civil for 5 minutes while exchanging half hearted ideas and silently judging each other's handwriting.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together. I've been playing husband since year 2. Paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down. Tears in her eyes, hand on her heart. Then some perfectly rehearsed excuse. We're not ready, let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5. And she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time. I'm convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere, and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it. When she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew. And she didn't even let me finish the speech. Just shook her head with this pitying smile. Like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke. Asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant. And the Mask came completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said, voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place? After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place? Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I'd spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. Didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working. She texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said, I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic Started creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night, acting extra sweet. Made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said, kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

Aunt Patricia watched my plate like a hawk. Sweetie, are you sure you need the mashed potatoes and the rice? Then came the clothing comments. That's a brave choice wearing horizontal stripes. You know, dark colors are more slimming. I tried everything. I asked her privately to please stop focusing on my body. I told her it hurt my feelings. I even brought articles about body positivity. She patted my hand and say she was just looking out for me because she loved me. That opened the flood gates. Patricia has a point about portion control. My cousin Jennifer chimed in at Thanksgiving. Have you tried intermittent fasting? I could send you some links. Uncle Rob began his helpful gym advice. You know, muscle burns more calories. My 12 year old nephew started asking if I really needed dessert. Even grandma, sweet grandma, started saying things like, you have such a pretty face. If only my birthday dinner last month was when they took it too far. As I reached for a second slice of my own birthday cake, the entire table collectively sucked in their breath. Aunt Diane actually moved the cake. Go away from me. We're doing this because we love you, she said. Fifteen relatives nodded an agreement. The next family dinner, I came prepared. Aunt Patricia reached for the bread and I gasped. Patricia, carbs after six? That's brave. She froze, hand midair. I kept.

Or what color is the grass? Like, your shirt is purple. And then they say, no, it's blue. Like, bro, it isn't my fault that I didn't know that because I see purple. And then as soon as they know it, they'll tell their friends, like, bro, did you know he's color blind? And then in one second, everyone comes and asks me questions. And then there is that one time I was with a friend, we got out of the store and I see a purple bicycle with green wheels. So I say, bro, what is that combination, bro? Like purple and green? And then he says, bro, that's blue. And I say, no. And then he calls an old man and says, sir, that bicycle is blue, right? And that gentleman says, yes.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight. Be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly, and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I turned onto our street, there was a black Infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walk. Hang up like he'd done it before. Becca opened. Before he could ring, they kissed. The kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too kind. I need. Needed to do something else. Something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe. How was your night? Good. You know how it is. Then next two Thursdays, I kept my routine, but park down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage, and that's when it hit me. The man was Mark. Mark, who supposedly moved to Seattle. Two years ago, my knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped the bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for Boys Night, when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Yeah, Mark was great. You guys still text, though, right? Sometimes. The next morning, she woke up different, with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors, and since it was Thursday, during lunch, she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew. The comment about Mark got her. Probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old. After work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then pick getting it back up at 7:15. She practically pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time, there was no car that showed up. And at 9:15, Becca's own car pulled Out. I followed her. First stop, O'malley Sports Bar, where she thought I'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused, checking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop, the dugout, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress, who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone. Probably my pic. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly Prime Sports Bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms. Heard her say, every Thursday night, group of guys, probably five or six of them, loud. One of them looks like this. The bartender studied her phone. Thursday's our slowest night. I definitely remember a regular group. Sorry. She left looking frustrated, sat in her car for five minutes typing furiously. Then she drove to the A M C. Theater. I gave her a 10 minute head start, then walked in through the side entrance. She was at the concession stand talking to the Teenage manager showed her phone again. He pointed toward the theaters. She went to check each one. Open doors, scanning the sparse Thursday night crowds. I went back to my car. Twenty minutes later, she emerged, looking defeated. Sat in her car for another 10 minutes. Through her rear window, I could see her on the phone, gesturing with her free hand. Probably calling Mark. Probably saying she couldn't find me anywhere. That maybe I knew that Thursday nights might not be safe anymore. She even drove by two more bars on the way home. Quick stops, desperate checks. When I got home at my your time, she was on the couch with wine, trying to look casual, but her leg was bouncing. How was your night? Studying. Guys go. Oh, Malley's. Why? Her jaw clenched. No reason. Just curious. Was it busy? Pretty dead, actually. Who all was there? Haven't heard their names in a while. The usual.

Like at first we're watching movies, eating snacks, all good vibes. But the second the lights go out, chaos. Suddenly someone's laughing at nothing for 20 minutes straight. Another kid is making shadow puppets on the wall like it's a Broadway show. And there's always that one kid who forgets to bring anything. No pillow, no blanket, just vibes. He's over there sleeping on the carpet using a hoodie as a mattress. And there's the group that swears they're staying up all night. Big talk at midnight. But by 12:30, half of them are knocked out brutally and the other half are wide awake arguing if aliens are real. And the food situation, wild. You got 10 people fighting over the last slice of pizza like it's a custody battle. Someone's sneaking chips at 4:00am and the crinkle of the bag might as well be a fire alarm. When morning comes, everyone wakes up looking like they've survived a natural disaster. Hair's a mess, someone's missing a sock and the kid who slept on the floor can't walk straight anymore. Best part, parents roll in. Like, so did you guys get some rest? Yeah, sure. If by rest you mean four minutes of sleep and permanent brain damage.

My life has been a living hell since they found my channel, and it's getting worse every day, all because of one group of girls. Like, it started with hate comments and putting pictures in my locker, but the final straw was when they came into school and handed me a T-shirt of my channel, asking if I could sign it since I'm so famous. And, bro, her friends acted like this was the funniest thing they'd ever seen. But I wasn't gonna just let this slide now, so I did some digging and found all their social media channels and saw that they're actually trying to blow up on TikTok themselves, just not with much success. So since they wanna be famous, I'll make them famous by exposing everything they said, all in this video, then sending it to their parents, future college, and blowing this video up for millions to see.

The iPhone 17 straight up leak. And then Roblox. Bro, Roblox was on another level of insanity. They said he sent an assist letter to SLEP which backfired so hard that SLEP actually clapped back. Roblox stock tanked by $12 billion. He dropped an AI generated apology. Chris Hanson pulled up, law by Mike pulled up and even the state of Louisiana started suing Roblox. Then out of nowhere, the US congressman gets involved. Roblox starts getting banned in countries like Qatar and Indonesia. And both the US and UK governments are now investigating Roblox for safety issues. While all this chaos is happening, creators like kreekraft are leaving the star program.

She returned 6 years later to find I'd divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2 3 years, max. Change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation. To our eight year olds, that first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home, and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decision. It's no more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curveball. Our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year two brought unexpected changes. Without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to enjoy My children. Year three changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partner ship could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her bonus mom. Their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes, and tucked them in at night. Year five was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and be being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year six, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward. After three Years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she own

I responded, bros before hoes, but moms before all. And everyone cracked up. Jason didn't smile, though. His face drained of color like I just confessed to murder. He grabbed all his stuff and moved 3 rows up the school bus without a word. Jason, what's wrong? I was just kidding. I called after him, but he wouldn't turn around. That's when I heard it stay. Casey, my girlfriend's best friend, was crying her eyes out in the back row. When I turned to look, her friend whispered urgently in her ear and she glanced at me before crying harder. Okay, hey, that was definitely weird. I started to wonder whether my joke was really that offensive. That's when my phone buzzed. Three missed calls from dad, but there was no signal. And at the red light, I caught the bus driver wiping his eyes in the rearview mirror. In my three years of knowing him, the most emotion he'd shown was mild annoyance when kids left trash on the seats. A cold feeling crept into my stomach. I got up to go talk to Jason, but Missus Unfitzharris blocked the aisle. Sit down. We're moving. I just need to sit down. I'd never heard her voice like that. I sat. But the second we got to the destination, I cornered Jason. Dude, what is going On he backed away. Nothing. I just, I need space, bruh. I was just kidding. I don't know if I'd pick my mom or my girlfriend. Why did you have to tell everyone what I said? Sid appeared out of nowhere and pulled me aside. Our team captain who never said more.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight, be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I turned onto our street, there was a black infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walk hang up like he done it before. Becca opened, before he could ring, they kissed the kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too kind. I need did to do something else, something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe, how was your night? Good. You know how it is. Then next two Thursdays, I kept my routine but park down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage and that's when it hit me. The man was Mark. Mark who supposedly moved to Seattle. Two years ago, my knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped a bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for boys night when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Yeah, Mark was great. You guys still text though, right? Sometimes. The next morning she woke up different with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors. And since it was Thursday during lunch, she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew the comment about Mark got her probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old after work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then pick getting it back up at 7:15. She practically pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time there was no car that showed up. And at 9:15, Becca's own car pulled Out I followed her. First stop, O'malley Sports Bar, where she thought I'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused, checking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop, the dugout, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer, this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone, probably my pic. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly prime sports bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms, heard her say every Thursday night, group of guys, probably five or six of them loud. One of them looks like this. The bartender studied her phone. Thursday's our slowest night. I definitely remember a regular group. Sorry. She left looking frustrated, sat in her car for five minutes typing furiously. Then she drove to the a m. C theater. I gave her a 10 minute head start, then walked in through the side entrance. She was at the concession stand talking to the Teenage manager showed her phone again. He pointed toward the theaters. She went to check each one. Open doors, scanning the sparse Thursday night crowds. I went back to my car. 20 minutes later, she emerged looking defeated, sat in her car for another 10 minutes. Through her rear window, I could see her on the phone gesturing with her free hand, probably calling Mark, probably saying she couldn't find me anywhere. That maybe I knew that Thursday nights might not be safe anymore. She even drove by two more bars on the way home. Quick stops, desperate checks. When I got home at my U full time, she was on the couch with wine, trying to look casual, but her leg was bouncing. How was your night? Studying my face. Good. Same as always. Yeah. Where exactly did you guys go? Oh, Malley's. Why? Her jaw clenched. No reason. Just curious. Was it busy? Pretty dead, actually. Who all was there? Haven't heard their names in a while. The usual.

It started when my sister Chloe came home crying because her boyfriend Jake dumped her. She's 25 and I'm 17, but she always acts like she's the victim in every situation. This time was different, though. She kept saying Jake was horrible and cruel. But when I asked what happened, she got all shifty. He said he broke up with her out of nowhere and kicked her out of his apartment. But then she mentioned she still had keys to his place because she forgot to give them back the next day. She left early in the morning and came back with this huge golden retriever. I recognized him immediately. It was Buster, Jake's dog. Jake love that dog more than anything. When his grandpa died last year, Buster was the only thing that helped him through it. I asked Chloe why she had Buster and she got this weird smile on her face. She said Jake didn't deserve to keep him since he broke her heart. Then she said something that made my stomach drop. She told me she was going to take Buster to the vet tomorrow to put him down as payback for what Jake did to her. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This dog was completely healthy and happy, just confused about being in a new place. Buster kept looking around for Jake and whining by the door. It was heartbreaking. I told Chloe she was being insane and she couldn't just kill someone's dog because she was upset. She laughed and said Jake should have thought about that before he decided to hurt her. Then she said if I told anyone, she'd make sure I regretted it. That night I couldn't sleep, kept thinking about Buster and how scared he must be. Around 2:00am, I heard Chloe on the phone with someone probably making the vet appointment. I knew I had to do something. The next morning, Chloe left for work and told mom she was taking Buster for a walk later. Mom didn't know the whole story. Chloe just said Jake asked her to watch his dog for a few days. As soon as both of them were gone, I called Jake. He picked up on the first ring and sounded terrible. I told him Chloe had Buster and was planning to put him down today. He went completely silent for like 10 seconds, then started freaking out. He said he'd been looking everywhere for Buster and thought maybe he got out somehow. I told Jake to come over now while Chloe was at work. He was at our house in 15 minutes. When he saw Buster, he literally started crying. Buster went crazy with excitement, jumping all over him and licking his face. I opened the door and Jake carried his dog out to his car. Before he left, Jake told me what really happened with Chloe. She Didn't just get dumped. She cheated on him with his best friend, Marcus. When Jake found out, he broke up with her and told her to move out. She stole Buster on her way out and left Jake's spare key on the counter so he thought she was being mature about the breakup. A few hours later, Chloe came home and went straight to look for Buster when she couldn't find him. She started screaming my name. She found me in my room and absolutely lost it. She called me a traitor and said I had no right to interfere in her business. Then mom came home and asked what all the yelling was about. Chloe told her I let some guy steal her dog. She made it sound like I just gave away her pet to a random stranger. Mom looked.

We'll make your sister pay. She'll never say no to family. I froze with the grocery bags in my hands. Through the kitchen window, I could see them all sitting around the table. Mom, dad, and my brother. Landon Harper's got that new job, dad was saying. Making good money now. We'll just tell her it's for Mom's surgery. Mom nodded. She gave us 12,000 for the roof last year, no questions asked. My stomach dropped. There was no roof repair. I'd seen the receipts myself. They'd used my money for Landon's gambling debts. How much this time? Mom asked. 50,000, Landon said casually, maybe 60 if we play it right. Tell her the cancer came back. Cancer? They were going to fake cancer to steal from me. I backed away slowly, my mind racing. The cancer scare from two years ago, the one that made me liquidate my retirement fund to pay for experimental. Had that been fake, too? I thought about all the times I'd helped. A car accident that wasn't covered by insurance. Landon's business that needed startup capital. Mom's dental work, Dad's back surgery. $57,000 over five years. All because I thought I was being a good daughter. Every family gathering, they raised me for being so generous. Behind my back, they were laughing at how easy I was to manipulate. I got in my Car and drove straight to the bank. I'd like to close all my accounts, I told the teller. All of them. Miss every single one. And I need cashiers checks for the full amount. documentation of every transaction I've made to these three people over the past five years. That evening, Landon called, right on schedule. Hey, sis, can you come over tomorrow? Mom has some news about her health. His voice had that practiced concern, the same tone he'd used for every fake emergency. Sure, I said sweetly. I'll bring the whole family something special. I spent that night making copies of everything. Bank statements, medical records I'd helped to pay for. Receipts from Landon's failed ventures. Five years of financial manipulation, all documented.

The man was gunned down in front of his wife and daughter. And instead of taking a second to acknowledge how horrifying that is, people are online making memes and throwing around cheap punch lines like his life was entertaining. He wasn't just a political figure on a stage. He was a husband and a father. And his daughter literally watched her dad collapse in front of her. Imagine being that kid one day, scrolling online and seeing thousands of strangers laughing about the worst moment of your life. You don't have to agree with his politics. You don't have to support anything he stood for. But celebrating a man's murder in front of his family isn't some clever protest. It's cruelty. Everyone talks about empathy and compassion until it's someone they disagree with. Then suddenly all that moral high ground disappears and death becomes a punchline. That's not justice. That's just heartlessness disguised as politics. Snoopy.

So I showed her what life looks like when I stop owing her love, effort, and commitment. We've been married eight years. Eight years of working overtime for our house, down payment, canceling plans when she needed me home, spending weekends fixing things to make her life easier. I thought I was being considerate, spirit, offering to set aside work and distractions to focus on us instead of appreciation. I got a sharp, dismissive response. Her tone was cold, almost rehearsed. I don't owe you intimacy, she said, arms crossed, eyes locked on me like she was daring me to challenge her. At first I thought I'd misheard. What does that even mean? I asked, half laughing, half nervous. She didn't flinch. It means exactly what it sounds like. I'm tired of you acting like it's some kind of obligation. Just because we're married doesn't mean I owe you anything. I felt like the ground had been ripped out from under me. Eight years of sacrifices and working myself to exhaustion, and now she was telling me my feelings and needs didn't matter. That the foundation of our marriage, trust in timidity partnership, was apparently optional. The fight didn't last much longer. She walked out, leaving me standing there with my thoughts racing. By morning, my frustration had turned into resolve. If she didn't owe me intimacy, then maybe I didn't owe her the endless sacrifices I've been making.

My friend Katie always had something to say about my face. Every time we hung out, she'd make these little comments like you'd look so much better with just some mascara or I have lipstick that would really help you out. I kept brushing it off because we've been friends since middle school and I figured she meant well. But then came her engagement party last month. I showed up in a nice dress, hair done, feeling good about myself. Katie took one look at me and said, oh, honey, you really should have told me you weren't doing makeup. I would have brought my kit. She said it loud enough for everyone to hear, including her fiance's family, who I was meeting for the first time. I felt my face turn red. Her mom even chimed in saying, Katie's right, dear. A little color would really brighten you up. I spent the whole night feeling like everyone was staring at my bare face. Katie kept introducing me as her natural friend with this fake sweet smile. That night I texted my sister about it. She was furious and said Katie was being a total jerk. Then she offered to do my makeup for the wedding since she works at Sephora. I told her no at first because I didn't want to be petty. But she convinced me that looking good wasn't About Katie. It was about me feeling confident. So two weeks before the wedding, my sister and I went shopping. We got everything, foundation, concealer, eyeshadow, palettes, the works. She taught me how to do a full glam look that made my eyes pop and my skin look flawless. We practiced three times until I could do it myself. Morning of Katie's wedding, I woke up at 6:00am to start getting ready. I did my makeup exactly like my sister taught me, then put on this stunning blue dress I've been saving for a special occasion. When I looked in the mirror, I barely recognized myself. I looked amazing. I got to the church early and found my seat.

My husband's friend Kate always had to be the main character in every situation. When someone else had good news, Kate suddenly had better news. At group dinners, she'd hijack any conversation within five minutes. I couldn't stand her, but I put up with it because she and Zach had been friends since college. After my husband and I announced our pregnancy at 12 weeks, things with Kate got really weird. Suddenly, Kate was everywhere we went sporting a small baby bump. She showed up at our favorite brunch spot rubbing her belly. She enrolled in our exact prenatal yoga class. She even switched to our OB practice. Nobody questioned it because these things happen, and women get pregnant at the same time, she posted weekly bump photos on Instagram, and everyone congratulated her just like they did me. Three months in, one of our friends mentioned something strange at a girl's night. She said Kate's belly looked bigger the previous Tuesday at book club than it did at Saturday's barbecue. When she brought it up, Kate burst into tears about how cruel it was to comment on a pregnant woman's body. She went on about water retention and bloating and how pregnant women deal with enough judgment without their friends piling on. Our friend felt terrible and apologized foolishly while the rest of us comforted Kate. After that night, nobody dared mention anything about her appearance again, even though I started noticing her bump size seemed to fluctuate, too. That's when things got uncomfortable. Kate started making comments about how wild it was that we got pregnant around the same time. She'd joke about our babies being best friends, or maybe even more than friends someday. Then the jokes got stranger, like when she said pregnancy Brain made her forget exactly when she conceived and wasn't it funny how close our due dates were? She started showing up at every single appointment Zach and I had, always in the waiting room when we arrived, claiming her appointment was right before or after hours. During our maternity photo shoot at the park, she appeared with her own photographer, saying what a coincidence that she booked the same spot. The photographer later told me Kate had called asking what time we'd be there. Everything exploded at my baby shower. My. My sister threw this beautiful garden party with all our family and friends there to celebrate. Halfway through opening gifts, Kate stood up and clinked her glass to make an announcement. With tears streaming down her face, she placed her hand on her belly and said, I have the most wonderful news to share with everyone. Zack and I are having a baby together! The entire party gasped, and she continued with a huge smile, I know this is unconventional, but isn't it beautiful that our babies will be siblings?

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My coworkers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas, was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight, I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife, Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. Proud form to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. The crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space. So when yelled laughter erupted, the CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was.

So my dad has this mouth like a sailor. Every other word out of his mouth is some form of curse word. He drops F bombs at breakfast, calls drivers idiots when we're in the car, and basically swears more than anyone I know. It's been like this my whole life. Last week I'm in the kitchen making a sandwich and I dropped the Mayo jar. It smashes everywhere and I go, oh, shit, not again. Pretty normal reaction. Action, right? Wrong. My dad comes storming in like I just committed murder. Watch your language, young lady. I don't want to hear that garbage coming out of your mouth again. I just stared at him. This is the same guy who stubbed his toe yesterday and yelled son of a bitch, bastard, piece of shit table loud enough for the neighbors to hear. But somehow me saying shit once is crossing the line. Are you serious right now, dad? Dead serious. You're better than that. That's when I got the idea. If you wanted to please my language, fine. But fair is fair. Okay, dad, you're right. Swearing is bad. So let's all stop starting now. Anyone who swears in this house pays $5 into a jar. Family swear tax. He laughed like it was a joke. Sure, honey, whatever makes you happy. I grabbed an empty pickle jar from the recycling and Wrote swear jar on it with a Sharpie, put it right on the kitchen counter where everyone could see it. Day one was amazing. Dad walks into the kitchen that morning, sees the coffee pot is empty.

Every Thursday for three years, I told my wife Becca the same thing. I'm going to hang with the boys tonight. Be back around midnight. Truth is, I was driving to the cinema to watch movies alone because I just needed some me time. But then two months ago, my movie ended abruptly and I came home two hours earlier than planned. When I turned onto our street, there was a black Infinity in our driveway. My heart stopped as I watched back all the footage from our doorbell camera and saw a man getting out of the car and walk. Hang up like he done it before. Becca opened. Before he could ring, they kissed. The kind where her hand went to his neck. My stomach dropped. I wanted to burst through that door and confront them, but I decided on the spot that that would be too kind. Needed to do something else. Something that would destroy her. So I drove around until 12:30 and walked in with a story about Tony getting drunk. Becca was showering. Hey, babe. How was your night? Good. You know how it is. Next two Thursdays, I kept my routine, but park down the street at 8:30 to watch. At the same time, the same car pulled up. I zoomed in on the ring footage, and that's when it hit me. The man was Mark. Mark, who supposedly moved to Seattle two years Ago, my knees were shaking, but I took screenshots and sent them to my lawyer to further build my case. When I was confident enough that I had everything basically set up, I dropped the bomb. Becca was going on about her fake plans for when I left for Boys Night, when I randomly blurted out, you know who I miss? Mark. That guy and I used to have so much fun before he moved to Seattle. Her fork stopped halfway to her mouth just for a second. Yeah, Mark was great. You guys still text, though, right? Sometimes. The next morning, she woke up different, with this nervous energy. She made some phone calls behind closed doors. And since it was Thursday, during lunch, she texted, what time are you heading out tonight? She never asked before, so I knew. The comment about Mark got her. Probably 7:30. Why? Just wondering. The guys doing anything special? Same old. After work. She was cooking in full makeup. You look nice, I said. Just felt like making an effort for you to come home to. But she kept checking her phone and setting it down, then picking it back up. At 7:15, she practically. He pushed me out. Don't want you to be late. Tell everyone I say hi. I drove to my regular spot down the street where I watched them, but this time, there was no car that showed up. And at nine fifteen, becca's own car pulled out. I followed her. First stop, o'malley's sports bar, where she thought i'd be. She walked in confidently, then came out five minutes later looking confused, checking her phone, scanning the parking lot. Then she got back in her car. Her second stop, the dugout, another sports bar. Through the windows, I watched her walk the entire place, moving table to table, even checking the bathroom entrance area. She showed her phone to a waitress, who shrugged. Back to the car, more frantic phone checking. Third stop, Buffalo Wild Wings. She stayed longer this time, 15 minutes. I could see her at the bar talking to the manager, showing him something on her phone, probably my picture. He shook his head, pointed to their mostly empty tables. Thursday wasn't exactly Prime Sports Bar night. Fourth stop, the dive bar where Tony actually used to drag us. She went straight to the bartender. I slipped in through the side door, ducked into the hallway by the bathrooms, heard her say, every Thursday night, group of guys, probably five or six of them, loud. One of them looks like this. The bartender studied her phone. Thursday is our slowest night. I definitely remember a regular group. Sorry. She left looking frustrated, sat in her car for five minutes typing furiously. Then she drove to the AMC theater. I gave her a 10 minute head start, then walk in through the side entrance. She was at the concession stand talking to the teenage manager. Showed her phone again. He pointed toward the theaters. She went to check each one, opening doors, scanning the sparse Thursday night crowds. I went back to my car. Twenty minutes later, she emerged, looking defeated. Sat in her car for another 10 minutes. Through her rear window, I could see her on the phone, gesturing with her free hand. Probably calling Mark. Probably saying she couldn't find me anywhere. That maybe I knew that Thursday nights might not be safe anymore. She even drove by two more bar on the way home. Quick stops, desperate checks. When I got home at my usual time, she was on the couch with. As always. Yeah. Where exactly did you guys go? Oh, Malley's. Why? Her jaw clenched. No reason. Just curious. Was it busy? Pretty dead, actually. Who all was there? Haven't heard their names in a while. The usual.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Change the locks. She left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decision missions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partner ship could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught sky to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. Their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after three years. Of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp in the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for.

Our instructor who always wore the cutest sets saw me crying and immediately cut her playlist. Hey, hon, are you doing okay? That's my man. I pointed at the screen where Blake was now shirtless making breakfast. The entire studio went silent, 25 girls in coordinating workout sets just staring. The blonde girl immediately hung up and turned around. Wait, girl, I'm so sorry. I swear I didn't know. Every single girl started climbing off their bikes. Someone handed me a liquid IV. Someone else had tissues, the good ones with lotion. Another girl was already fixing my mascara with her emergency makeup kit. Four years, Natalie shrieked. This absolute trash man has been with her for four years. The blonde Isabella looked like she was gonna throw up her green juice. I met him on Bumble and he said he just got out of something casual.

Ellie strutted in with her Balenciaga bag. Mrs. A. Leek in her Saturday costar fit but make it fashion. Her Aunt Linda, who I didn't even know was coming, had her Cartier sunglasses on indoors. Where is she? Mrs. Leek's voice could have cut diamonds. She saw me, saw Isabella. I watched her perfectly microbladed brows go through the five stages of grief in real time. Ellie, call your brother now, mom. Maybe we should now. The way Ellie's acrylics clicked on her phone screen was aggressive. What? Blake's annoyed voice came through the speaker. Get your butt down to cycle soul.

When I turned 15, my mom went from strict to straight up paranoid. One night after dinner, she plopped down next to me with this weird smile and said she was installing a family safety app on my phone. I watched her tap away, giving herself access to everything. My location, photos, texts, even my drafts on social media. It's just to keep you safe, honey, she said, handing my phone back like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. It felt like having a stalker who lived in my house. At first I tried to be cool about it. Maybe it would calm her down, right? Wrong. Things got insane fast. She text me in the middle of conversations asking who I was with. Comment on memes I haven't even posted yet because she was reading my drafts. The worst part? She started replying to my friends pretending to be me. My buddy Jake texted asking if I wanted to hang out, and my mom replied, sure. Sure thing, buddy! With way too many exclamation points. Jake called me laughing, asking why I was texting like a soccer mom. I had no idea what he meant until I checked my messages. Then came the day that broke me. I was in history class when Mrs. Wilson pulled me aside. Looked uncomfortable as hell. Liam, your mother called the school. She's concerned about some message you sent about Me. My stomach dropped. I knew exactly what she meant. I texted my best friend Kyle the night before, joking about how our history teacher's haircut looked like she stuck her finger in an electrical socket. It was just good friend stuff, not meant for anyone else. But my mom had read it and called the school to complain about my private joke. I wanted to disappear into the floor. By lunch, Kyle wasn't talking to me. Neither was Jake. Word got around that my mom was reading everything, and suddenly nobody wanted to text me anymore. Some kids even blocked me. It was like my social life had a disease. And the disease was my mom. That night, I stared at my phone, feeling trapped. But then I noticed something. The tracking app worked both ways. It log every time someone access the account. I spent hours studying those logs, and what I found made my skin crawl. My mom wasn't just checking my phone during the day. She was logging in 1 a m, 2 a m, even 3 a m. She was forwarding my messages to her laptop. She was screenshotting my photos. She was living inside my phone 24 7. So I came up with a plan. I created a fake friend named Daniel, made up this whole persona, gave him a backstory. Even found some random photos online to use as his profile pic on a group chat with myself.

He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about cryptocurrency. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I caught Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance. I'd love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. Proud form to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. The crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. Toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone clapped looking Around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space. So when yelled laughter erupted, the CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was.

The school just outside of Denver had more than 100 police officers rushed to the scene after reports of violence broke out on campus. Right now, three students in, including the suspect, are in critical condition at the hospital. What's even more shocking is that officials aren't even sure if the suspect was old enough to drive. One student who was just eating his lunch outside said the only thought that ran through his head was, no way this is happening. This feels one in a million. It's such a heartbreaking situation.

Charlie Kirk getting shot and killed at a university. And all on top of that, the 9 11 was 24 years ago today. As much as I hate Charlie Kirk and his decisions, no one deserves to get killed. Imagine what his wife and kids are feeling right now. His children can't grow up with their dad. His wife is now a single parent. I genuinely hate Charlie, but I can't imagine how his family is handling this right now. And apparently they witnessed it. The way the blood came out of his neck was genuinely traumatizing. The way his body went limp immediately was horrifying. But anyways, moving on to the D4 V D situation. He's been on tour for like what, a month now? He hasn't been in LA for like a month. And the body hadn't decomposed enough for it to be in that car for so long. The body was in there for three days, and the police haven't even made him a suspect. And plus he had a concert like yesterday, I'm pretty sure. But yeah, moving on to the girl that was stabbed. She was literally minding her business before she got stabbed. And as soon as she got stabbed, everyone was So calm. Like, hello, she needs help. There was literal blood dripping on the floor. I don't have much information on the other situations, but the fact that this is all happened in a week is honestly scary. Like, this month has just started. What's going on

It started when my sister Chloe came home crying because her boyfriend Jake dumped her. She's 25 and I'm 17, but she always acts like she's the victim in every situation. This time was different, though. She kept saying Jake was horrible and cruel. But when I asked what happened, she got all shifty. He said he broke up with her out of nowhere and kicked her out of his apartment. But then she mentioned she still had keys to his place because she forgot to give them back the next day. She left early in the morning and came back with this huge golden retriever. I recognized him immediately. It was Buster, Jake's dog. Jake love that dog more than anything. When his grandpa died last year, Buster was the only thing that helped him through it. I asked Chloe why she had Buster and she got this weird smile on her face. She said Jake didn't deserve to keep him since he broke her heart. Then she said something that made my stomach drop. She told me she was going to take Buster to the vet tomorrow to put him down as payback for what Jake did to her. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This dog was completely healthy and happy, just confused about being in a new place. Buster kept looking around for Jake and whining by the door. It was heartbreaking. I told Chloe she was being insane and she couldn't just kill someone's dog because she was upset. She laughed and said Jake should have thought about that before he decided to hurt her. Then she said if I told anyone, she'd make sure I regretted it. That night I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about Buster and how scared he must be. Around 2:00am, I heard Chloe on the phone with someone probably making the vet appointment. I knew I had to do something. Then next morning, Chloe left for work and told mom she was taking Buster for a walk later. Mom didn't know the whole story. Chloe just said Jake asked her to watch his dog for a few days. As soon as both then were gone, I called Jake. He picked up on the first ring and sounded terrible. I told him Chloe had Buster and was planning to put him down today. He went completely silent for like 10 seconds, then started freaking out. He said he'd been looking everywhere for Buster and thought maybe he got out somehow. I told Jake to come over now while Chloe was at work. He was at our house in 15 minutes. When he saw Buster, he literally started crying. Buster went crazy with excitement, jumping all over him and licking his face. I opened the door and Jake carried his dog out to his car. Before he left, Jake told me what really happened with Chloe. She Didn't just get dumped. She cheated on him with his best friend, Marcus. When Jake found out, he broke up with her and told her to move out. She stole Buster on her way out and left Jake's spare key on the counter so he thought she was being mature about the breakup. A few hours later, Chloe came home and went straight to look for Buster when she couldn't find him. She started screaming my name. She found me in my room and absolutely lost it. She called me a traitor and said I had no right to interfere in her business. Then mom came home and asked what all the yelling was about. Chloe told her I let some guy steal her dog. She made it sound like I just gave away her pet to a random stranger. Mom looked.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together, I've been playing husband since year two, paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down, tears in her eyes, hand on her heart, then some perfectly rehearsed excuse, we're not ready. Let's wait till we're more stable. Timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5, and she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time, convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it when she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew, and she didn't even let me finish the speech, just shook her head with this pitying smile like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke, asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant and the mask came. Completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said. Voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. No, my place. After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place. Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only poly see the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. She didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working, she texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic. Started creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night acting extra sweet. Made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said. Kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

It was 2:00am on a Tuesday and I had work in the morning. But this kid next door had been screaming for three straight hours. Not just normal baby crying, but these gut wrenching wails that made my skin crawl. I tried putting pillows over my head, closing all my windows, even playing loud music through my headphones. Nothing worked. Never met my neighbours properly. They'd moved in about six months ago. This young couple with a baby. The guy seemed okay, always nodded when he saw me getting my mail. The woman looked exhausted every time I saw her, which honestly didn't seem that weird since new parents always look like zombies. But this crying was different. It wasn't stopping and it was getting worse. Around 2:00am, I heard what sounded like furniture being moved around violently. Then a woman's voice shouting something I couldn't make out. That's when I started getting worried. I walked to my window that faced their apartment and tried to see what was going on. Their blinds were mostly closed. I could see shadows moving around frantically. The baby was still screaming, but now it sounded muffled, like someone had closed a door or something. I debated for like 20 minutes whether to call the cops. I mean, what if it was nothing? What if they were just having a rough night and I was being that annoying neighbour Who calls the police over everything? But something felt really wrong. The way the woman had screamed, the furniture noises. Now the baby sounded different, more desperate. So I called 9 1 1. The operator asked me what my emergency was, and I felt stupid saying it, but I told her I thought something might be wrong next door because a baby had been crying for hours and I heard what sounded like a fight. She said they'd send someone to do a welfare check. I figured they'd knock on the door, see that everything was fine, and I'd probably never make eye contact with my neighbors again out of embarrassment.

Instead of texting back or Giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place. Cooked his favorite pasta dish. The one my mom always made.

Now, a growing theory right now is that ice cream trucks are being used to kidnap these kids. Now if you just look it up in the TikTok search bar or just online in general, you'll see a bunch of videos of ice cream trucks recently being just a no, too suspicious. I mean, there's videos surfacing right now of ice cream trucks being out as late as eleven PM. An ice cream truck at night? Yeah, uh, no thanks. I choose life. I'm gonna be honest though, if ice cream trucks are actually being used to kidnap these children, I mean, it's just natural fucking selection at this point. I mean, we are in the big 2025. I mean, who in their right fucking mind is still going up to ice Cream trucks, especially at night time. It's like, come on, buddy, is your fucking brain located in your fucking ass? I will say, though, I was driving to my friend's house the other night, and I saw a suspicious ice cream truck on the way there, and, you know, I didn't. I didn't really think anything of it. Then on the drive home around 10 p m, I saw another, and I still didn't really think anything of it. Then I saw another, and I was like, okay, what in the true crime documentary is going on right here? Let me know what you guys think is happening in the comment section and if you think the ice cream trucks are actually the ones taking these kids.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggs shells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten How to enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tuck them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the plate.

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently and just her school clothes, no coat, tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said. I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was 9 p. M. On a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up feeling how ice cold her little body was and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key, Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected, sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning. I told her actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me, nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter. Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up thing like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever, but I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years, the man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me. He picked up phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear, from rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialed a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine. It's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed months ago? File everything Tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my daughter. I hit another number.

My ex boyfriend kept harassing me for months after we broke up, showing up at my work and following me home. I filed restraining orders, changed my locks, even moved apartments, but nothing worked. The police said they couldn't do much unless he actually hurt me. I was terrified and felt completely helpless. My friends kept telling me to get a security system, but I was already broke from moving apartments twice. I was working double shifts just to afford the new place. And I thought maybe he'd finally give up and leave me alone. Free car that drove by made my heart race. He would leave flowers on my car with creepy notes about how we belong together. Sometimes I'd find him sitting in the parking lot of my apartment complex just watching my windows. Started using different routes to work and shopping at stores across town. But he always seemed to find me somehow. My co workers had to walk me to my car every night. One night around 2 a. M. I heard someone trying to break into my new apartment. I grabbed my phone and hid in my closet. Heart racing through the crack in the door. I could see it was him. He was drunk and stumbling around, knocking over furniture and screaming my name. I was shaking so bad I could barely dial 9, 1 1. He was saying the most horrible things about what he was Going to do to me. I could smell the alcohol from across the room and he kept bumping into walls like he could barely stand up. I remember thinking this was it. He was finally drunk enough to actually hurt me and there was nowhere left to run. I could hear him breaking picture frames and throwing things around. While I was whispering to the dispatcher, I heard him in my kitchen going through my drawers. I was slamming them open and closed looking for something. Then I heard the worst sound possible. He found my knife set. He started yelling about how if he couldn't have me, nobody could. I thought I was going to die in that closet. The 9 1 1 operator told me to stay hidden and keep the line open. She kept asking if I had another way out. But my apartment was on the third floor. I could hear him getting closer to my bedroom and I was praying the police would get there in time. Then suddenly everything went quiet. No footsteps, no yelling, nothing. I thought maybe he was trying to trick me into coming out. This silence was almost worse than the screaming because I had no idea where he was or what he was planning. I held my breath and pressed my ear to the closet door trying to hear anything. My hands were cramping from gripping my phone so tight. After what felt like forever, I heard him screaming. And.

It's pathetic. So I put a stop to our fake marriage. We've been married for 5 years and I thought I was being the perfect husband. I spent 3 hours cooking her favorite meal for our anniversary, set up candles, even dug out that playlist from our first date. When she walked through the door with her sister and best friend, she took one look at the setup, rolled her eyes and said loud enough for everyone to hear, stop trying to be romantic. It's pathetic. Pathetic. You look desperate. Then she turned to her friends. This is exactly what I was telling you about. He does this needy stuff constantly. The room went dead silent. Her sister looked uncomfortable. Her best friend stared at the floor. I stood there holding wine, watching my wife destroy our marriage with one sentence. I at the wine down, looked her straight in the eye and said, you know what, you're absolutely right. She expected me to apologize, to scramble. Instead, I started blowing out the candles. What are you doing? She asked, losing that confident edge. Stopping, I replied, gathering the flowers. Romance is pathetic when it's one sided. So I'm done being pathetic. I tossed the flowers in the trash and ordered pizza. We can eat like roommates from now on, pepperoni or cheese. That night she tried damage control, talking about bad days, overreacting. But something had shifted in me. I heard You perfectly, I told her. Message received. No more romantic gestures, no more pathetic be behavior. She laughed it off. Maybe we both need to be more realistic about what marriage actually is. Those words would haunt her the next.

My parents hung metal bars across our bedroom ceilings when I was 9 and made us wrap our legs around them to sleep upside down like bats because they believed gravity was poisoning our brains. Mom and dad had joined this group that taught gravity pulled toxins into your skull while you slept normally. The leader said humans were meant to hang like our ancestors who lived in trees. They came home from the first meeting with construction equipment and spent all night installing bars strong enough to hold our weight. Dad tested each one by hanging from it himself, timing how long before his face turned purple. The first night was torture. They showed us how to hook our knees over the bars and cross our ankles for security. My little brother cried until he threw up, which looked terrifying coming out upside down. Mom just cleaned it up and rehung him. She said our bodies needed time to remember their natural position. Blood rushed to my head until I thought my eyes would explode. But they padlocked our door and removed the regular bed, so we had no choice. After a week, we Learned to sleep in short bursts before the headaches got too bad. Then mom decided we weren't hanging long enough. She installed timer locks on our knee hooks that wouldn't release for eight hours if we needed the bathroom too bad. She gave us adult diapers and Said our ancestors didn't climb down from trees for every little thing. My sister developed constant nosebleeds from the pressure, but dad said that was just toxins leaving her brain. School was impossible when we kept falling asleep at our desks from exhaustion. The nurse called home about the rope burns on our legs and the burst blood vessels in our eyes. Mom withdrew us for homeschooling, saying traditional education was poisoning us with right side up thinking. She hung bars in every room so we could practice proper positioning all day. Even meals happened upside down with special straws and tubes so we could eat without choking. I tried sleeping on the floor one night, but dad had installed motion sensors alarms screamed until they found me and rehung me with zip ties instead of the timer locks as punishment. The ties cut off circulation and my feet turned blue. They only cut me down when I started convulsing. Mom said I was having a gravity detox seizure and hung me right back up with looser ties. My brother figured out he could unhook one leg at a time and rotate to prevent the worst pain. But mom caught him and decided he needed stronger treatment. She ordered special boots that locked onto the bars and couldn't be removed without a key. The boots were so heavy, they stretched our knee joints backwards. He screamed for hours until his voice gave out. Then they got boots for all of Us. The group leader visited to check our progress and said we weren't inverting young enough. He had a Newborn daughter who'd been hanging since birth and never experienced gravity poisoning. Mom got pregnant immediately just to prove she could raise a properly inverted baby. She hung upside down her entire pregnancy. When my new sister was born, they hung a tiny bar in her crib with special harnesses. She never Learned to crawl normally, just swung bar to bar like they wanted. Then I found Dad's laptop open to the group's private forum. The leader was selling our progress photos to medical fetish sites. Hundreds of pictures of us hanging, unconscious, bleeding, crying. Members paid extra for video of our detox seizures. The leader used the money to build a compound where families could live fully inverted. Dad had already put down a deposit. I printed everything and

My girlfriend, Molly, put her hand under my desk. And please, Mrs. Dodson, you have to legally let us go. Mrs. High Dodson was crying now with mascara running down her cheeks. I'm sorry, but if I let you all run out of the class, the gunman might get you. We need to wait. I looked at Molly and tried to keep my voice steady. Don't worry, babe, I'm going to figure out a way out of this. Missus Dodson had kept our entire class trapped in the room. She's been acting strange all week, but today she locked the door during last period because she sensed a warning. Missus Dodson suddenly screamed and pointed at the door there. Did you hear those gunshots? Everyone get down. We all looked at each other confused, but Missus Dodson was shaking and clutching a rosary to her chest. She heard it all 20 of us to the back corner of the room furthest from the windows. She started praying in Latin while we huddled together. Some kids were crying. Others were texting their parents frantically. The school had probably already called wondering where we were. Basketball practice had started two hours ago. Drama rehearsal was happening without half the cast. Missus Dotson, I have an idea, I said, interrupting her prayer. How about you let us out through the window since we're only on the First floor and we can all escape and get help. She shook her head violently. No, the government has friends outside. They'll shoot all of you the second you climb out. I won't let you leave. He started going around hugging each student and telling them she loved them. Kids were flinching away from her touch. This woman who usually graded papers with perfect posture was now wild eyed and sweating through her cardigan. Bradley was a class troublemaker who usually slept through lessons. He stood up and crossed his arms. Missus Dodson, you're so insane that you make me want to actually do my homework. Let us out, you crazy witch. School dismissal was four hours ago. Her face twisted into something ugly. The only dismissal you're going to have is straight to hell. I should let you out of the classroom and let the gunman unload on you. Fine, then let's do it. Bradley walked toward the door. Missus Dodson immediately crumbled. I'm sorry, sweetie. You know I can't let you leave here. I have to keep the door locked so I can protect you all. While she was focused on Bradley and trying to pull him back to the group, I saw my chance. Keys were hanging from her belt loop. I carefully reached over and unclip them, trying not to jingle the metal. Molly saw what I was doing and created more distraction by fake crying loudly. I crawled toward the door, staying low like we Were actually in danger. I didn't realize till later that we really were. My hands were shaking as I found the right key. Lock clicked open and I yanked the door handle. Run, I shouted. All 20 students rushed for the door at once. Missus Dodson screamed and tried to grab people, but we pushed past her. We ran down the hallway and burst through the front entrance into the parking lot where police cars were everywhere. The cops had their hands on their weapons until they saw it was just a bunch of terrified teenagers. They immediately asked us what happened. Our teacher went insane and trapped us in there for four hours. I told the nearest officer. He nodded grimly. We're sorry we took so long. We just got the call about you guys. After we searched in Missus Dodson's house, you won't believe what we found, the officer pulled out a small notebook from his chest pocket and his face got even more serious than before. He started writing something down while shaking his head slowly. And I could see other cops behind him talking into their radios about something urgent. My legs were still shaking from running out of the building, this cop was making it worse with whatever he wasn't telling us yet. He looked up from his note.

Now, if you do, you'll both win a round trip flight to a very romantic tropical location of your choice. So the question is, Steph, who was the last person besides yourself to see you naked? Does she meet naked? Yes. Hey, baby. Baby.

I've been dating Yuki for six months. When she finally invited me to Sunday dinner with her family, my hands were sweating because this girl meant everything to me and family approval was her world. Just warning you, she said, gripping the steering wheel. They can be protective and they speak Japanese at home, so don't take it personally if they seem cold. I nodded, my stomach in knots. But she didn't know Japanese was my first language. Half Japanese through my mom, but I inherited every single one of my Irish dad's genes. Pale skin, light eyes, the works. People see me and assume white guy. And honestly, sometimes it's been easier to let them. Tanaka House hit me like a warm hug. Keco's cooking filled the air. Multiple generations chatted everywhere. Yuki's mom greeted me with a polite bow and formal smile. Nice to meet you, she said in careful English. The pleasure is mine. Tanakasan. That's when I caught it. The second I turned to her dad, I heard Keiko whisper to Yuki's aunt Kogai, when I got to, when I did, so you, this foreigner won't last long. Game on. For the next hour, I smiled politely while they served me passive aggression, English to my face, Japanese when they thought I couldn't understand and they were brutal me. Te Kogai, Yuki's grandmother said, passing rice. Look at this. Foreigner, so pale and weak looking. Karare washashitsukaina, her uncle muttered. He can't even hold chopsticks properly. No manners. Tommy enjoying the food, Yuki's cousin asked sweet, then whispered, he probably doesn't know what he's eating. I gritted my teeth but stayed quiet. Be polite. Don't cause a scene, Kiko said, refilling my tea. This person is so rude, doesn't even try to learn our customs, the aunt added. He's probably making fun of Japanese culture. Every comment was a small cut, but I kept my mouth shut. Yuki tried including me, switching languages, looking frustrated as conversations kept drifting to rapid Japanese that shut me out. Then her dad talked to Yuki's brother like I was invisible, he said, this is what happens when daughters go to universities. They bring home gaijin who will never understand us. Yuki WA hontoni bakada, the brother replied. Yuki is truly being stupid dating someone who doesn't speak our language. How can there be real love without communication? My jaw clenched. Canno jabun nojise WA munaishi iro keco added, she's wasting her life on someone who can't even talk to her family. My chest burned. I taken insults about my appearance, my manners, my culture. But calling Yuki stupid for loving someone, that crossed every line. Then.

Yeah, that's. I needed an exit. Can you give me one specific thing? Yeah. Was she sloppy when she was eating her food? She not put her napkin on her lap? What specifically made you think that she's nasty? Well, it was going fine and like halfway through the meal she grabbed my hand and she leaned over into my ear and whispered, I'll be back in a few minutes. Okay. I have to honk out a dirt snake. No, she did not say that on the first day. Are you kidding me? You're lying. You're lying about that, Danny. That cannot be real. I swear to God. And she, what was that term again? What was that term again? Oh, man. She said I have to honk out a dirt snake. Was she being funny or was like, this is legit? I thought I thought she was making a joke and I just said, are you serious? She just said, no, really, I have to go download a brown load up. She had to have been joke. Yeah. I mean, come on.

She was gone for a few minutes. I mean, at the time, I couldn't eat. I, I lost my appetite. It was, that's how serious she was being. What did she say when she got back to the table? Like she had to have had a smile or been laughing. Yes, she had a smile and she patted her belly and she said, she said, it looks like someone dropped the kids off at the pool. She's so good. Oh my gosh. Was your face red? I didn't know what to say. And she just jumped right back into her meal. And after a few minutes, she noticed and she thought I didn't like it. She asked me if I didn't like the food. And I said, I just pretended I was feeling sick. I would, dude, I would have been so gross that like I'm with my girlfriend like a year and a half now and I don't even know that she does that still. And I don't ever plan on knowing that she does that. So. Alright, Danny, I can understand why that would be a turn off for you. Yeah, that's why I shook her hand. I just, I needed to get out of there. Alright, Danny, thank you very much for being honest. I'm sorry you had to endure that date. Yeah, thanks. I mean, I'm sorry too. Like That is that all you that you guys needed today or? Yeah, that's just about everything.

We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer, where I was supposed to be her plus one. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She. I think we should transition to being friends. We get along so well, have the same friend group. We'd make amazing friends. But not amazing partners. Here's what killed me. She said all this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay, already got an exit strategy. I said, we're adults. We're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing. Two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies? Okay. I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. Treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7:00am. Could you drop Off my work laptop? Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans. Monday works better. She didn't like that.

My dad showed up at my apartment with flowers for me like I was his girlfriend. And my fiance had to tell him he was my father, not my husband. I always knew my dad was weird about me. When my parents divorced when I was 9, my mom moved on pretty quick, found herself a nice guy named Paul who treated me like a normal stepdaughter. But my dad, he never dated anyone, ever. He'd always say I was his whole world and he didn't need anyone else. At first, it felt special. He'd pick me up from school with my favourite candy. He'd take me shopping and let me get whatever I wanted. He called our Saturday Hangouts daddy daughter dates, which seemed normal enough when I was 10. But things got weird as I got older. When I started wearing makeup in eighth grade, he threw it all away and said I was too beautiful to need that garbage. When I got my first phone, he demanded all my passwords because he needed to protect me from predators. He'd scroll through my texts every night at dinner. High school was worse. He hated all my friends, especially the guys. If I hung out with anyone he didn't approve of, he'd give me the silent treatment for days, just sit at dinner staring at his plate, acting like I didn't exist until I Apologized. The worst was when I told him I was dating Trevor when I was 17. We were driving to target and I casually mentioned I had a boyfriend. He pulled into the parking lot and just started crying, like ugly sobbing. He said I was throwing away everything we had together for some stupid boy who didn't really know me. I felt so guilty. I broke up with Trevor the next week. College gave me some space, but he'd call me three times a day. If I didn't answer, he'd drive the two hours to campus to make sure I was okay. My roommate thought it was sweet at first until she saw him show up at 1:00am because I'd fallen asleep without texting him good night. After graduation, I moved to my own apartment and met Malik at my job. He was calm.

Is Daisy Williams present in school today? My teacher, Missus Harrah, clicked the intercom button. Yes, the principal's voice echoed. Lockdown now. This is not a drill. The way he said it made my blood freeze. Missus Harrah shrieked under the desks. Lights off. Move, move, move. Nobody said anything, but everyone was thinking the same thing. There was a shooter. I couldn't help but think he was after me. A few minutes later, we heard sirens and then screaming. Missus Harrah tried to calm us down and told us it might be a misunderstanding, but her hands were shaking. She kept refreshing the email on her laptop like it was giving her live updates. The screaming got louder and it wasn't just one voice anymore. Multiple people in different parts of the building. Then we heard a loud pop from the hallway, like a metal slamming or something crashing hard. People started crying and whispering that the shooter was right outside and I believed them. Pia grabbed my hand and her palms were soaked with sweat. I could see Mister Kids class across the hall through our door window. Lights already off, no movement, just darkness where 20 kids should have been. I looked at our teacher and for the first time in my life, I saw her cry. She sat with us, hugged the younger kids and told us it would be okay. But after a while, She got up again and walked back to her laptop. Then we heard it, footsteps running past our door. Thud, thud, thud. I couldn't help myself. I had to look. Two paramedics were sprinting down the hall, pushing a wheeled stretcher, the kind you see on medical shows when someone's heart stops away from the door. Daisy, Missus Harrah whispered, voice shaking. She was scared, too. I sat down and immediately texted everyone what I had seen. Even Missus Harrah stood up slowly and crept to the door to check the window before opening it. That's when it flung open. The principal stood there with an actual cop who had his hand resting on his gun. You, Daisy, come with us. Immediately, my worst fear confirmed. The shooter had sent them or maybe they thought I was involved somehow. Missus Harra looked between them and me, confused. Get your things, honey, Missus Harra said. And that scared me more than anything because in three years of chemistry class, she'd never called me honey. Every single person was staring at me as I grabbed my backpack with shaking hands. The hallway was complete chaos. More cops than I'd ever seen in one place. I heard a paramedic shout, we're losing him. Move as he flew past us. My classmates were pressed against the door windows in every room watching me get us.

I pointed it out and he got so flustered, mumbling something about laundry. Then he looked at me totally serious and said, are you gonna cancel the date now? Like a nervous middle schooler, I fell for him right there, socks and all. Two, we were at the arcade and he got way too invested in the claw machine, not for himself, but because he saw a stuffed turtle. He said, look like me when I'm cranky. It took him six tries, 20 bucks and some serious trash talk to the machine, but he got it when he handed it to me. He said, now you can hold me when I'm not around. That turtle's still on my bed. 3, he doesn't know how to cook at all. But one night I was sick and he showed up with instant noodles, gummy bears and a handwritten get well card drawn in blue pen. He spelled fever wrong, but he also drew me as a superhero, complete with a cape and a little speech bubble that said, I got this. I swear I got better instantly. He made me a playlist titled Songs That Remind Me of You and forgot to check the shuffle setting. First song was Shrek 2 soundtrack. I asked if it was a joke. He panicked and said, no, it's romantic. He really loved her. Five, he tied my shoelace because it came undone and said, safety first, princess, like he was a knight or something. I giggled and he turned red. 6, I caught him flexing in the mirror when he thought I wasn't looking. He whispered, she likes strong arms to himself. I had to pretend I didn't hear so he wouldn't die of embarrassment. 7, we walked past a Lego store and he stopped mid sentence, gasped and said, can we please go in just for a minute? Thirty minutes later, he was building a tiny pirate ship and explaining the lore of each mini figure. Eight, he named a raccoon that lives near his apartment. Captain bites and leaves snacks for it. Every time it shows up, he waves like it's a neighbor. First time I saw it, he said, look, he came.

I came home early and found my mom in bed with Mister. Lowell, my AP chemistry teacher who's married with three kids. I stood frozen in the doorway, feeling like I was about to vomit. Her blazer was draped over the lamp and his dress shirt lay inside out on the floor. The smell of his Cologne, the same one that made me gag in chemistry class, was now contaminating my mother's bedroom. Mr. Lowell ran past me, clutching his pants while his pale chest showed scratch marks, and my mother wrapped herself in a sheet with her face completely drained of color. Please let me explain, she said, with tears streaming down her face as she reached toward me with shaking hands. How could you? I screamed and backed into the hallway. He's my teacher. His wife goes to your book club. My mother sat on the bed and put her head in her hands while her whole body trembled. I had no choice. Everyone has a choice about who they sleep with, I said as my voice cracked. Mom said, Mr. Lowell has been selling pills to students at your school. My face dropped. What? Fentanyl, sweetheart? Xanax? Adderall. Three kids have overdosed this semester alone. I stared at her and tried to process this. So you decided to have an affair with him? How does that make any sense? Even If he was, why wouldn't you just call the police? My mother stood on unsteady legs and walked to her closet. She pulled out a box from the top shelf with trembling hands. Inside were photos, recording devices, and documents with FBI letterhead. My blood went cold when I looked at surveillance photos of my chemistry teacher in dark parking lots. Mister Lowell isn't just some teacher selling pills on the side, she said while her voice broke. He's part of a major operation. They're using teachers in five districts because no one suspects educators. She sat back down and looked older than I'd ever seen her. The FBI recruited me six months ago because I had access to him through school events. Just supposed to gather information at PTA meetings. But he wouldn't talk business unless we got closer. Tears were running down her face now. One of the kids who overdosed died last month. You remember? He was 14 years old. His little sister found his body. I remembered his memorial, where his parents sobbed uncontrollably. His little sister had to be carried out of the auditorium while the rest of us wore purple ribbons. Does dad know? I whispered. No one knows except my handler. She looked destroyed. Not even your father knows. Because if anyone knew, the whole operation would collapse. We spread photos across the bed showing Mister Local meeting teachers in parking garages. Text messages using code words were visible alongside a spreadsheet of Student names with prices that made me sick. These were kids I knew and sat next to in class. They target specific students, he said while showing me their notes. Kids with divorced parents, kids with anxiety about college, and foster kids are all marked. They know exactly who's vulnerable. She pulled out another document while her hands shook. Worse now they're expanding to middle schools and planning to recruit eighth graders as dealers. Brother's friend Bram is on their list. I felt my stomach drop thinking about Bram, who played video games at our house every weekend. He still wore superhero shirts and collected Pokemon cards. Look at his file, she said. Single mom who works nights and they're behind on rent. They know exactly what to offer him. They've been watching him for months and documenting his routine. She showed me more files detailing five kids who died from overdoses in two years, with all deaths made to look accidental or like suicides. Teachers were discussing doses in group texts like they were talking about homework assignments. Mr. Lowell handles the AP students personally, she said. He offers them study aids for the SAT s, then gradually increases the doses.

I was halfway through our Valentine's sleepover at Sophie's, laughing at Maya's impression of her hinge date when my phone lit up. It was my best friend Chloe. So I saw you posted that you're wearing the blue dress to my birthday brunch tomorrow. Yeah, we need to talk about that. The room got quiet. Sophie stopped mid stroke on Jess's pinky nail. Okay, I'm not trying to be a bitch, but when you wear it, you look like a stuffed sausage. It's really embarrassing. She pause to examine her lashes. Remember Brad's pool party when you wore that bikini, and I told you everyone was judging you? This is gonna be worse. I'm just being honest because I love you. Click. He hung up before I could even process. Everyone was staring at me. 20 seconds of pure silence while my face filled with heat and I tried not to cry. Guys, she didn't mean it like that. She's just an honest person. Oh, hell nah. Maya actually threw her nail polish bottle onto the couch. Did that hoe just call you a stuffed sausage? The girl from Sophie's work who I just met tonight said, girl, what the actual fuck? Maya was already scrolling through Chloe's Instagram. This bitch. Maya held up her phone. She literally posted about body positivity yesterday. Wait, wait, wait. Sophie said, isn't her birthday brunch at that bougie place downtown? The one where all the influencers go? I Nodded, still trying to stop crying. Jess, who never swears, said, fuck this. Girl. Girls, new plan. The energy shift was instant. Suddenly everyone was huddled around me like we were planning a heist. Sophie pulled up the revolve website. What dress is it? I showed them the blue midi with the cut out back. Okay, it's in stock, so he said, adding it to her cart. What size? Within five minutes, every single girl had ordered the same dress in their size. Overnight shipping. Still, I defended her, blissfully unaware of what a good friend is meant to look like. But guys, this isn't necessary. It's just the way she is. Girl, I love you, but you need to shut the fuck up, because this is happening, Maya said, still furiously scrolling through Chloe's socials. Oh, this is gold. She told everyone she's 24 tomorrow. This bitch is turning 27. How do you know? I asked, pretending to be surprised because I found her college graduation photos from 2020. Do the math. By 3:00am, they'd found her real age, her actual job, MLM, her face tune fails, and the fact that she'd been telling people she got into Cornell when she went to community college. Nothing wrong with that. But lying? Guys, is this too mean? I don't want her to be sad on her birthday. Girl, we're giving her exactly what she wants, Maya said with a smirk. She wants all the attention in her dress. she'll Be the only one not in blue and get all the attention she wants. Even I couldn't argue with that. Like, she kinda ate. The next morning, my friends wouldn't let me check my phone. They did my makeup, hyped me up, and we all got dressed together. Six girls in almost identical maxi dresses. Girl, the body is bodying! Sophie exclaimed. Eight down! Maya yelled, cheekily, slapping my ass. It was the first time girls had hyped me up like that, and I couldn't even hide my smile. We rolled up to the restaurant together. I could see Chloe through the window at a long table, wearing black, surrounded by her sorority sisters. She saw us approaching and her face went through like five different expressions. Happy birthday, babe! Maya said way too loudly as we walked in. Happy 27th! The table went silent. One of

My mom is the academic baddie of the family. She has three degrees and one PhD, all from Ivy Leagues. And whenever I won an academic award, she'd brag about it for weeks, say it was all because of her. That was her thing. It was like she still wanted to hang on to her glory days. Well, I wasn't going to be the one to ruin that. So when she wanted all of my college application essays to go through her first, I let her. After all, she was the one to get my GPA up to 4.2. But then something strange happened. No college was accepting me, and I never received a single rejection email either. Instead, I got angry, sometimes even threatening ones like Harvard, who said my essay was a disgrace, or brown, who threatened to have me blacklisted from other schools. It was around this time that I started to notice a pattern. Every time I got rejected, she got this look in her eyes like she'd known all along, like she wanted it that way. But there was only one college I actually wanted to go to, university of North Carolina at Charlotte. I never told my mom about it because it wasn't an Ivy League. Plus, I didn't want her to think I was a failure for not getting accepted into yet another college. But then something strange happened. I got an interview within just two weeks. Of applying. They told me I was exactly the kind of student they were looking for. And that evening, I couldn't help myself. I did the craziest thing known to mankind. I told my mother. And despite everything, I still expected her to jump up with excitement or at least smile. But no. Instead, she just said, that's wonderful, sweetie, but don't get too excited. You don't want to be disappointed. I stared at her blankly. It was the first time I asked myself whether my mom really wanted the best for me. And I reminded myself about all the hours she had put into making me study, how my GPA was only high because of her. So I told myself the same thing she's always said to me, that I was being ungrateful. But after a week, I finally snapped because my dream college told me I was the perfect candidate. But week later, I got the email from U N. C. Charlotte. There it was in plain red, Ariel font, rejected. It was the nastiest email I had ever seen. Didn't even mention my grades, just talked about my poor character. But I wasn't confused. I knew that somehow my mom was behind it. So I stopped telling her anything, found a tiny school 3 states away that she never heard of, applied in secret, got in, packed my car the day after graduation and left while she was at her stupid book club for the first few Weeks, she called me every day but I never picked up because every time she would leave me a cute little voice recording, it was 5 minutes long where she described how much of an embarrassment I was to the family name. Another said I was sabotaging everything she had worked for and my favorite, that I was going to end up in a dead end job at 30 and end up dying alone. Like, mom, isn't that you? Lol. Anyway, I blocked her after that and most of my family took my side. Fast forward 5 years and I'm now a paralegal with an amazing salary and perspective job. I was in the middle of joking to my coworker about how we both thought we never get into college when she asked what my GPA was, 4.2 dash. What? What? She exclaimed. How the EF did you struggle to get in? Before I could even respond, she picked up her phone and called her dad. My dad's a college admission officer. Sorry, but I need to know what happened. I just smiled. Daisy had always been a little quirky. Daddy, do you know his effery encounter my name? By this point, I was almost killed over from how hard I was laughing, swatting the phone to try and get her to give up. But as soon as he responded, my body went still from 2,019 to Harvard. Daisy was smiling, I wasn't. Yes, daddy, I knew your memory was Still good. Why didn't she get.

One day my daughter came back from school and ran into my arms like she was scared. I could feel her shaking so I took her inside and made some French toast, which was her favorite food. I thought she just had a really bad day and missed being at home. But I couldn't have been more wrong. Once she calmed down, she told me, Mommy, something happened today and I think I'm supposed to tell you about it. An uneasy knot formed itself in my heart when she told me that the school counselor had called her into his office for a special game. He handed my daughter a stuffed unicorn and told her that this new game was very popular with the children, which made my daughter excited and eager to learn. Then the counselor made her point the unicorn between his legs and push on it repeatedly. My daughter told me how he made weird faces at times and then closed his eyes and leaned back. Towards the end, I was so horrified and felt a wave of nausea rush through my body so I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. What kind of sick person would make a 7 year old girl do this kind of thing? Not to mention he worked at a school and it was me who willfully sent my daughter near his vicinity. I kept Bouncing between blaming myself and wanting to burn the entire world. My husband was no longer with us, so it was up to me to stand up for my daughter. I don't know what made me approach the school administration before the police, but that's exactly what I did. And the school administration laughed at me, saying that my daughter was clearly playing a prank. They said they had heard other students make similar jokes about the school counselor and said that parents should teach their kids not to lie. By the time I made it to the police station, the school had already called them and explained the situation. They thought I was a crazy mother who was trying to give merit to my daughter's filthy lie. I had looked straight into my daughter's eyes when she told me the story, so I knew she was telling the truth. But no one wanted to believe me. And I felt like I was in a nightmare. This is when I remembered something important and ran back home to open my jewelry safe. Inside there was a note that I hadn't looked at for a long time. You see, although I was currently a doctor, I had been a very inexperienced nurse at one point. And one time a very stern looking man with a lot of face tattoos walked into our hospital with a bullet wound. No other nurse wanted to treat him since he looks so scary. So they Sent me. I convinced myself that everyone deserves treatment and cleaned his wounds with the utmost concentration. I even engaged him in conversation and joked about how he should stay away from bullets in the future. When it was all over, the guy thanked me and handed me a note with his phone number on it. He said, if you ever need someone taken care of, I won't ask for any payment. I typed in that phone number and to my surprise, it actually connected. I told him who I was and he said, I remember you.

How did you do it? My ex, Ashley, thought our relationship was charity work. Every time we went somewhere together, she'd find ways to remind me I'd never find someone like her again. It started with her introducing me as just a friend at bars. When guys hit on her, she'd let them buy her drinks. Then mentioned she had a boyfriend after. You should see their faces when I point to you. She'd laugh later. The shock is hilarious. The worst was when she just disappeared one Saturday. No text, nothing. Then I saw her Instagram story. Ashley on some yacht wearing basically a string bikini, sitting on some guy's lap while he popped champagne. Videos of her dancing with a bunch of rich dudes, them doing body shots off her stomach. Best day ever. With location tag, Miami Beach. We live in Jersey. When she came back Sunday night, sunburnt and hungover, I was furious. Where the f were you? She rolled her eyes. Tom invited me to his yacht party last minute. It was a networking opportunity. Tom was some crypto guy who'd been dming her for months. You went to Miami without telling me? She laughed, actually laughed. It was last minute, babe. These chances don't come often. When I showed her the videos of her grinding on those guys, she shrugged. It's a boat thing. Everyone was dancing. Don't be so uptight. You're in a relationship, I yelled. Yeah. And I came back, didn't I? She ruffled my hair like I was a child. I could have stayed in Miami. Tom has this insane condo. He wanted to fly me to Ibiza next week. She pinched my cheek. But I came back to Jersey to my little computer nerd, my anxious overthinker who's mad about a boat party. She kicked off her heels and collapsed on my bed. I looked past all these red flags with rose colored glasses until the one year anniversary incident happened. I planned everything perfectly just for her on our anniversary. Flowers in hand, campaign in my car, reservation at her favorite restaurant. I was about to knock on her apartment door to surprise her when I heard voices through her open window. Ashley and her friends, all Instagram model types who made fun of me whenever they visited. Ash, I still don't get it. Her friend Jenna was saying, why are you with him? You could have literally anyone. I kept closer to the window, still holding the roses like an idiot. Ashley laughed. You want to know a secret? He'll never leave me, ever. I could do anything and he'd take it. I have complete freedom. I go to Miami. He waits. I hang with my exes. He deals with it. Tom keeps flying me places. Brad takes me to dinner. But this one, she laughed again. He worships me, like actually worships me. But don't you want someone better? Another voice. Asked eventually, yeah. But you know how Brad destroyed my confidence when he cheated with that bartender? This one looks at me like I'm God. He tells me I'm perfect every morning, begs me not to leave him. I need that right now. I heard them all giggling. Once I feel like myself again, I'll find someone on my level. But for now, he's exactly what my ego needs, like therapy but free. They all burst out laughing. I stood there, flowers in hand, and knew something had to change. She needed me for her ego. Time to take away her supply. I spent the next two weeks planning exactly how to.

For as long as I can remember, my sister Claire has tried to compete with me. She's two years older, but whenever I achieved something, she found a way to one up me. When I got engaged, she got engaged six months later. When I bought my first house, she bought one down the street. But nothing compared to what she did when I got pregnant. My husband and I struggled for years with infertility. After two heartbreaking miscarriages and countless doctor visits, we finally got the news that we were expecting. It felt like a miracle. From the moment I saw those two pink lines, I already knew the name I wanted for my daughter. My grandmother raised me. After my dad passed and my mom checked out, she was my entire world. Her name was Evangeline. And before she passed, she used to say, if you ever have a little girl, I hope she carries my name. I told Claire the name one night when I was three months pregnant. I thought we were having a sister moment. She smiled and said it was beautiful. I should have known better. Two months later, Claire announced she was pregnant, too. She acted surprised and thrilled that our babies would grow up together. I was genuinely happy for her. Until the family baby shower she threw for herself. As I walked into the decorated venue, I saw a giant sign that nearly knocked the breath out of me. Welcome baby of Evangeline. I froze. I thought it had to be a coincidence, but now Claire got up and made a speech about how she always loved our grandmother's name and how it was perfect for her daughter. I pulled her aside after the speeches, trying to keep my voice steady. Claire, you knew I was naming my daughter of Evangeline? She smirked and shrugged. Well, I'm due first. Nothing stopping you from picking something else. I was stunned. My entire family just stood there awkwardly pretending not to take sides. My mom even whispered, it's just a name, honey. But it wasn't. It was the one promise I made to my grandmother. I went home that night and cried harder than I ever had through our infertility journey. But the longer I sat there, the more my sadness hardened into something else. Termination. If Claire wanted to play dirty, fine, but she underestimated me. I spent the next few weeks quietly gathering every piece of paperwork I needed. See, Claire hadn't actually filed any legal paperwork yet. She was calling the baby Evangeline, but hadn't registered the name officially. Meanwhile, I expedited my own legal name reservation with the state. In our state, you can pre

Hi. Is Nicole there? Yes, it's Nicole. Hey, Nicole. How are you? My name is Jubal and I host a morning radio show called Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Okay. How can I help you? Well, I'm calling you today because we recently got an email into our show from somebody who's trying to get a hold of you. Someone trying to get a hold of me? Yeah. Apparently they've tried to call you a bunch and you're not responding to them. So they asked if maybe we could get you on the phone. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I'm a little confused. It's a segment that we do on our show called The 2nd Date. It's where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up not calling them back, they email us to see if we can get you on the phone and find out what happened. Oh, jeez. So the guy's name is Ed, and you know Ed from your rock climbing group. Oh, my God. Yeah, I do. I know him well. Ed emailed us because he said that when you guys were supposed to go out, you ended up saying you had to rain check it to help your friend out with a flat tire. But since then, you haven't talked to him or even shown up to the rock climbing group. He's giving you a lot of information. Um, what else did he tell you? God, that's pretty much It, he just told us that you guys met at class and we're supposed to go out and then you, he thinks you made up an excuse. Uh, I did, but I think he's leaving out a big part of the story. Really? He did, he did something weird, didn't he? I know he did something weird at your house. I definitely classify it as weird. Yeah. Okay. So what happened? Oh, God, this is so embarrassing. Is it like what, what did Ed tell you about our, about our date? He said that you guys were at your rock climbing class and then after you were supposed to go somewhere, so you went back to your house to shower and then.

My son came into my room fully dressed for school and just stood there in the doorway like he was waiting to be punished. I asked what was wrong and he said, can I stay home today? I feel really sad. I don't know why. I just don't wanna go. At first I almost gave him the response I was raised on. Life doesn't stop just because you're in a mood. But the way he said it, it didn't sound like a kid trying to skip class. It sounded like a kid trying not to cry from something much worse. I told him to go sit down while I got ready, then walked into the bathroom and locked the door. I needed a second to breathe because something about it hit too hard. Not the sadness, the fact that he asked. As a kid, I was taught to hide feelings like that, to bury them deep, never speak them out loud, and especially never expect kindness afterward. So I took a breath, came out and told him, alright, you're staying home, but you're not in trouble. And I'm not mad. He kept looking at me like he was waiting for the butt. There wasn't one. We spent the day doing nothing worth posting about. We didn't talk about why he felt sad. I didn't try to fix it. I just let him exist. We made lunch, watched something stupid, and sat on the couch. Like the world wasn't pressing down on either of us. At one point, he looked over and asked, do you ever feel sad for no reason? I nodded more times than I can count. He didn't say anything else, just leaned against me and closed his eyes. That night, while he brushed his teeth, he looked at me in the mirror and said, I thought you'd be mad. Last time I cried, you told me to act my age. I. I didn't even remember saying that, but apparently he did. After he went to bed, I stayed up cleaning the living room. I found his backpack under the blanket he had curled up in, and when I unzipped it to pull out his lunch box, I saw a folded sheet of paper tucked between two math work sheets. It wasn't a school assignment. It was a note written in pencil, erased and rewritten more than once. It said, I don't want to feel this way anymore, but if I tell someone, they'll make me feel worse for not wanting to be alive.

I hated group projects more than anything in college. Every single time I'd end up doing all the work while everyone else just showed up for the grade. So when Professor Williams assigned our final ethics project worth 30% of our grade, I swore things would be different this time. The professor randomly put me with three students I barely knew, Alex, Jordan and Sam. I was actually excited because maybe working with strangers would mean they'd actually care about their grades. Boy, was I wrong. I made a group chat the same day and sent detailed messages about meeting times, dividing up the work and setting deadlines. Radio silence. I tried again the next day. Nothing. I even walked up to Alex after class and asked if he got my messages. He just shrugged and said, yeah, we'll figure it out later. Two weeks passed. The 20 page research paper was due in 10 days and nobody had written a single word. I kept sending messages, trying to set up meetings, offering to do video calls. They left me on read every single time. I had a choice. I could let our whole group fail or I could do what I always did. So I spent the next week pulling all nighters, researching corporate ethics scandals, writing analysis after analysis, adding proper citations and references, 23 pages of solid work. I was exhausted but proud when I Submitted it online. I only put my name on it, not theirs, just mine. The very next morning, the day before our presentation, my phone started buzzing like crazy. Alex was calling me over and over. When I finally picked up, he sounded panicked. Hey, Maya, we're all ready to present now. Just make sure you add our names back to the title slide before class. Okay? I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Add your names back. You guys didn't help write anything. Come on, don't be like that. We're a team. Just put us on there. I hung up. 20 minutes later, Sam was knocking on my dorm room door, acting all friendly like we were best friends. Maya, hey, we just wanna make sure everything's good for tomorrow. We can all present different sections. What sections did you write? I asked. Well, we didn't technically write them, but we can present them. That's basically the same thing, right? I told her no and closed the door. That's when things got ugly. They emailed Professor Williams that same night, claiming I had excluded them maliciously from the project and refused to collaborate. They said I was trying to take all the credit for work they had done. They even said I deleted their contributions from the shared document. Professor Williams replied to all of us the next morning. He said there would be a hearing after class where each person would be graded individually based on what they Could prove they contributed. When I walked into the classroom for our presentation, my three group members were already there with printed papers and fake concerned expressions. They had actually printed out what looks like rough drafts with their names on them. During the hearing, they went first. Alex claimed he had written the entire introduction and that I had deleted it and rewritten it in my own words. Jordan said he had researched all the case studies, but I had stolen his work. Sam said she had done the conclusion, but I had cut her out completely. They showed Professor Williams.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how To enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and, and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor role. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we. I watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for.

So my brother Jake got married, like, three weeks ago, and the whole thing was basically a slap in the face. His wife Megan, decided nobody under 21 could come because they were serving alcohol and didn't want any minors getting drunk. I was 19 at the time, which apparently made me some kind of liability. The excuse was complete bullshit, and everyone knew it. I don't even drink that much. Maybe a beer here and there with friends, but I'm not some alcoholic teenager who's gonna embarrass their precious wedding. But whatever. That's what they decided, and my parents just went along with it, like always. I asked them to reconsider a few times because, honestly, it hurt. Jake and I used to be close growing up. We shared a room until I was 14, played video games together, the whole thing. But ever since he started dating Megan two years ago, she's basically been calling all the shots. She thinks she's better than everyone because her dad owns some car dealership and she went to private school. After they kept saying no, I just stopped caring. If I wasn't good enough for their wedding, then fine. I wasn't gonna beg anymore. Then last Saturday rolls around, and Jake texts our family group chat saying he wants everyone to go to some fancy steakhouse to celebrate the wedding. My parents Were all excited, talking about how nice it would be to finally celebrate as a family, but I just replied that I wasn't going. My mom called me right away asking why not? I told her the same thing I told everyone else. I didn't see the point in celebrating something I wasn't even invited to. She tried to guilt trip me, saying it would mean a lot to Jake and that my cousins Becca and Tyler were going even though they didn't get invited either. But here's the thing. Becca is 13 and Tyler is 15. Their parents literally forced them to go. They didn't have a choice. I'm 19, I pay my own phone Bill, I work at Best Buy part time, and I'm starting community college in the fall. I can make my own decisions about where I spend my Saturday night. My parents kept trying to convince me all week. My dad even offered to pay for my meal, which honestly just made it worse. Like, you couldn't fight for me to be at the actual wedding, but now you wanna throw money at me to show up to the Celebration dinner? The night of the dinner, I. I stayed home and ordered pizza. I was playing call of duty with my friends when my phone started blowing up. First it was Jake texting me asking where I was. Then Megan sent me this long paragraph about how disappointed she was that I couldn't be mature enough. To support my brother's happiness. Funniest part is they acted all surprised that I didn't show up. I literally told them I wasn't going. What did they expect? After they got home from dinner, Jake came to my room and tried to have some.

It's the only place where she feels completely safe, where she has control and where no one can hurt her. She takes it everywhere, clutching it like armor against a world that's already proven it can be cruel. I used to worry about the addiction until her therapist explained it. It's her safe space. Let her have it. I met Lucas eight months ago. I didn't tell him about Maddie for the first three months, not because I was hiding her, but because I needed to be sure. She'd only met two of my dates in the eight years since her father left, and both times ended in disasters that set her progress back months. The first one tried to high five her. She didn't speak for three days. The second brought her A teddy bear, and tried to hug her. The panic attack lasted an hour. Lucas was different from the start. When I finally told him about Maddie, about the abuse, about the silence, about the switch that never left her hands, he didn't do what the others did. He didn't say, I'm great with kids or she'll warm up to me. He just said, I'll just follow your lead. We waited another two months before they met. I planned it carefully. A brief encounter at our apartment. No pressure, no expectations. Maddie knew he was coming. She sat on the couch with her switch headphones on, already retreating into her digital world. Lucas walked in, gave her a small wave. She didn't return, and then did something unexpected. He pulled out his own switch and sat in the chair across the room, not next to her, not trying to see her screen, just playing his own game. Twenty minutes passed in silence. Then Maddie's head tilted slightly. I saw her glancing at his screen. Another 10 minutes go by and she pause her game. I held my breath. Is that Mario Kart? Her voice was so quiet I almost missed it. Lucas looked up. Casual as anything. Yeah, the new one. Do you play? She nodded. I'm terrible at Rainbow Road, he said, then went back to playing. Five minutes later, I can beat Rainbow Road. No way. It's impossible. And just like that, my silent daughter was offended enough. To speak again. It's not impossible. I have three stars on every cup. Lucas paused his game, looking genuinely impressed. Every cup? Even 2 hundred C C? She actually sat up straighter. Especially 2 hundred C C. Prove it. I watched, stunned as Maddie scooted to the edge of the couch, not closer to him. She maintained that careful distance, but engaged. We could race online. They exchanged friend codes without ever leaving their separate spaces. For the next hour, they played Mario Kart together while sitting eight feet apart. Maddie didn't just play, she trash talked. You're about to eat my dust, she muttered after selecting her character when she won the first race. She actually smiled when Lucas Blue shelled her on the third lap of

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy Robert looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let me guess, looking for a rich boyfriend? Smart girl. Lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colours are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interesting perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me, and continued his lecture. A girl like you probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man, because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do. Flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was familiar with the Artist's work. Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the Pretty Pictures doesn't count as being familiar with Art, Sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes from decades of study, not whatever you Learned from TikTok. Robert decided to test me. Rapid firing questions. Who's Basquiat? What's Kiara Scuro? Name three Renaissance painters besides da Vinci. When I started to answer, he cut me off. Wrong. See, this is why galleries shouldn't have open events. You probably googled some terms before coming here to impress men, but Riley here is working in a tradition you couldn't possibly understand without a proper education. Not community college, sweetie. Real universities. He returned to my painting, now explaining it louder to raw crowd. What Riley has achieved here would cost probably 100,000 in education to even attempt. The materials alone cost more than you'd make in a month at whatever retail job you have. He looked at my outfit with disgust. Target clearance rack, right? Someone who shops there couldn't possibly grasp the investment in this piece. He probably spent more on one brush than your entire outfit. When I suggested the artist might be self taught, Robert sneered at me. Is that how you Learned about art? Painting parties? Robert grabbed my wrist to me to another angle, his grip too tight. You're too stupid to even stand in the right spot. Riley intended for This. To be viewed from exactly here, your ignorance is actually disrespectful to his work. He kept his hand on my wrist while explaining though. Honestly, explaining this to you is like teaching calculus to a toddler. You lack the basic foundation to understand any of it. He noticed me trying to pull away and squeeze harder. What am I keeping you from taking selfies? This is exactly why serious collectors hate these events. Girls like you come for the free alcohol and to hunt for sugar daddies. You're polluting the space where real art appreciation happens. He waved at a security guard. She's drunk. And her

Said I'd end up cleaning toilets for people like him, not knowing his dad worked for my mom. I was the quiet kid in eighth grade whose mom always said to keep a low profile at school. She dropped me off a block away every morning before heading to her office, and I knew not to mention that she meant the executive suite of the biggest company in town. Bruce's dad worked there, too, always bragging about being a regional sales manager. Bruce had no idea my mom was the one who signed his dad's paychecks, though. And because of that, Bruce made me the target of his bullying. Everything started on a Tuesday morning in early October when Bruce knocked my books out of my hands in the main hallway while I knelt down to gather my scattered papers. He stood there laughing with his friends. Later that same day, when I held the door open for him after lunch, he shoved past and told everyone I was probably hoping for a tip like a doorman. By Thursday of that week, he had progressed to stealing my lunch money during second period and announcing loudly that I was too poor to afford food anyway. Friday afternoon brought another escalation when he shoved me into a locker after PE and made comments about my clothes smelling like thrift store while the entire hallway erupted in laughter. The following week brought even worse treatment. Every time I raised my Hand. During English class on Monday, he interrupted to call me stupid and wrong. When test results came back on Wednesday and I had earned an A, he grabbed my paper right off my desk and ripped it into pieces while telling everyone the teacher probably felt too sorry for me to give me the F I really deserved. During lunch periods throughout that week, his harassment evolved from simply knocking over my tray to something more humiliating. Would grab my sandwich from my reused grocery bag, take a dramatic bite, and spit it out while declaring it was welfare food and mystery meat before throwing everything in the trash. On a particularly bad Thursday, I tried a different approach and offered him my chips, thinking maybe kindness would work. He knocked them out of my hand and ground them into the cafeteria floor with his heel while explaining that he didn't want to catch whatever diseases poor people carry. The entire cafeteria watched in silence. He made me clean up the mess with my bare hands. Physical education class became my daily nightmare after that. He would wait until I was changing clothes, then grab everything I owned and throw it all in the shower, leaving me standing there in my underwear. While I tried to retrieve my soaked clothes, he would loudly describe to the entire locker room how skinny and malnourished I looked from eating dollar store food. The harassment reached new levels the day he found My phone with its cracked screen. In early November, he picked it up and called it ancient junk, then explained that his dad had told him poor people always have broken phones because they can't take care of anything. He threw it on the ground and stomped on it repeatedly until the screen went completely black and the phone wouldn't turn on anymore. When I wore the same jacket three days in a row because my other one was still drying from being thrown in the shower, he started a rumor that I only owned one set of clothes. He would make gagging sounds whenever I walked past in the hallways and hold his nose while telling everyone I hadn't changed my underwear in a week. Career day arrived in mid November, and Bruce had spent the entire week telling everyone how his dad was going to present about being successful in business. The morning of the presentations, he cornered me in the bathroom and pushed my head toward the toilet while his friends held the door shut. He kept my face inches from the water and told me I better get used to cleaning toilets for rich people like him. His dad went first during the presentations, strutting around the classroom.

Ever since I was born, our house had an open door policy. If that open door policy took steroids, my dad specifically loved enforcing it and always told us that if a door was left closed, I could say goodbye to it. I always thought he was joking until I turned 5 and experienced it myself. I was in the room with my dolls with a closed door, when suddenly it slammed open. Next thing I knew, dad had his tools out and was taking the door clean off its hinges. He then went out into the back and burned it. It still had my bunny stickers on it, but he didn't care how hard I cried. On top of that, by dinner, not only the door, but the dolls I bought with my own money were burned, too. I cried to my mom, but all she could say was that dad had anxiety about hidden dangers, so it was best to just let him feel safe. Thing is, this only got worse as I got older. When I got my first period, I desperately wanted some privacy, but the curtain my dad installed wouldn't fully close. Naturally, I shut the door. That's when he barged in, claiming nothing natural needs hiding. He stood there while I changed my tampon in the shower, telling me not to be shy. I thought it couldn't get much Worse. But I was wrong. After weeks of begging my mom for a sleepover, she finally agreed for my 14th birthday. My friends arrived excited, having never visited until they saw our doorless house. There were a few strange glances thrown my way, but we moved on, running straight to my room, giggling with excitement. But the happiness did not last long. My dad started hourly safety patrols with his flashlight, peering into my room. He came in and examined every one of my friends, telling them to twirl to make sure they didn't have anything on him. And since I was the only one with the skirt, I had to twirl the longest. My friends were too creeped out and got their parents to pick them up the next day in school. Everyone was whispering about my doorless house and creepy dad. Their parents banned them from talking to me. I lost all my friends and became completely isolated. I remember at this time I began truly hating my dad, and that only intensified at 16. I woke up to him pulling off my blanket. I screamed at him and he went red before claiming he was searching under my mattress for contraband. My mom actually tried to intervene, but she was dragged out of my room. All I heard was the slap before the house went silent. The next morning, my mom had a bruise, and my door frame had a camera set up in it. I left At 17, with just a backpack to go to college, I didn't speak to either of them for a full 20 years. And I should have left it like that. But one day I decided to bring my 12 year old daughter to visit. I didn't want to see dad, only mom. So I had her promise me that she'd keep my dad away from my daughter. She said yes. Well, at around 2:00am, I woke to the feeling of my daughter pressing into my chest. She was sobbing that Grandpa had been touching her hair. And that's when I saw the blanket we had put up for some privacy have been torn down. Dad had been touching my daughter the whole time we slept. I rushed out and saw him in his room sleeping, pressing the blanket against his chest. I wanted to call him on the spot, but before I had the chance to confront him, my mom appeared out of the bathroom. I could see visible signs of what must have been her attempting to stop him. She broke down and started whisper apologize

I stared at that crumpled 20 and two tens like they were aliens. My daughter Emma was only 7, and I had no clue whose kid I was supposedly feeding. The handwriting was neat, definitely an adult's. And the note was on some fancy stationery with little flowers on it. When Emma got home from school, I showed her the money and asked what was going on. She just shrugged and said, oh, that's from Becca's mom. Becca doesn't have lunch money this week, so I've been sharing my sandwich. My heart melted a little, but I was also confused. Why didn't this mom just pack her own kid lunch? The next morning, I decided to pack extra food just in case. Two sandwiches, two juice boxes, extra crackers. Emma didn't even question it. She just smiled and said, thanks, Dad. Becca will be so happy. I dropped her off at school, then went to work. But I couldn't stop thinking about this Becca kid. That afternoon, I got a call from the school. Mister Williams, we need to discuss something with you about Emma. My stomach dropped. Did she get in trouble? Did something happen? I rushed over there, expecting the worst. The principal, missus Davis, sat me down in her office with this weird look on her face. Your daughter has been bringing extra food every day. This Week and sharing with a classmate. We normally don't allow food sharing because of allergies, but we wanted to talk to you about the situation first. She explained that Becca's family was going through a rough patch. Her mom worked three jobs but still couldn't afford school lunches. They'd applied for the free lunch program, but there was a waiting list. Meanwhile, Becca had been sitting at lunch with nothing but a water bottle. Emma apparently noticed on Monday and just started splitting everything in half. Her sandwich, her apple slices, her cookies. She'd even been giving Becca her juice box and drinking from the water fountain instead. I was proud of my daughter, but also heartbroken. No kid should go hungry at school. I told Missus Davis I wanted to keep packing extra food until Becca's free lunch kicked in. He smiled and said that would be fine, but mentioned that Becca's mom had been trying to find me to pay me back. That evening, there was a knock on our door. A woman in scrubs stood there looking exhausted. Are you Emma's dad? She asked nervously. I'm Janet, Becca's mom. I work at the hospital downtown. She looked like she hadn't slept in days. He pulled out a worn envelope and tried to hand it to me. I know $40 isn't enough for all the food Emma's been sharing, but it's all I have right now. I get paid again on Friday. Her voice was shit.

We had this situation yesterday with a married woman who came in with her boyfriend, really awkward when she realized her husband's sister worked there. The table goes quiet. Forks stop moving. Jordan looks confused, glancing between me and Nicole. What do you mean? Jordan asks slowly. Nicole's face is red now. She's just making things up. You know how dramatic she can be. I pull out my phone, show Jordan the secure.

His parents showed up at our door in March without even asking. His mom literally called and told me they were coming to wait out quarantine at our place. Like, not asked, told me. And I already knew this was gonna suck because they've always treated me like garbage. They make these snide comments about everything I do, act like they own the place, and basically think I'm not good enough for their precious son. Right from day one, they started running our apartment like it was theirs. They tell me what to cook, when to clean, how loud my music could be. But the worst part was the stupid air conditioning fight that went on for weeks. It's been like 85 degrees every single day here, and I keep the AC at 70 because that's comfortable, but nope. They started whining about being cold, so I compromised and put it at 75. I'm already sweating my butt off, but whatever. I'm trying to keep the peace. That wasn't good enough, though. They wanted the heat on in 90 degree weather. The heat. I'd wake up in the middle of the night, literally drenched in sweat because they'd sneak over and crank the thermostat up to, like, 80 degrees. I told them to stop messing with it probably 20 times, but they kept doing it anyway. So yesterday morning before work, I grabbed a Roll of duct tape and put, like, 10 pieces over the thermostat. I even wrote a note that said, do not touch the thermostat while I am at work. In big letters. Pretty clear, right? I get home at six PM, and it hits me like a wall of heat the second I open the door. It's hotter inside than it is outside, which shouldn't even be possible. The duct tape is ripped off, my note is crumpled up on the floor, and they've got the heat cranked to 98 freaking degrees. 98! I checked the thermostat three times because I couldn't believe it. I marched straight to the guest room, where they're just chilling like nothing happened. His mom is sitting there filing her nails, and his dad is watching some cooking show. I'm like, dripping sweat already, and I go, why could you not follow the simple instruction of do not touch the thermostat? This is my home! I'm tired of you saying rude things to me. I'm tired of you treating me like a child and making your own rules for my apartment. You either need to respect me and my boundaries or go back to your own house. Mom doesn't even look up from her nails at first. Then she gets this nasty look on her face and says, you have no right to barge in here without knocking. That was not only an invasion of privacy, but you need to take the attitude out of Your tone. I've dealt with much bigger bitches than you before. That's when I completely lost it. She called me a bitch in my own apartment, after I let them stay here for free, after I've been bending over backwards trying to make them comfortable, after they've been treating me like dirt for months. She kept going on and on for, like, 30 minutes about how disrespectful I am and how I need to learn my place and all this other garbage. I just stood there letting her dig her own grave. When she finally shut up, I looked at both of them and said, get out. Pack your stuff and get out of my apartment right now. His dad tried to jump in, like, now hold on. Let's all calm down here, but I cut him off. No, you heard what she said. She called me a bitch in my own home. Get out! They started arguing that they had nowhere else to go and that I was being dramatic. I told them that wasn't my problem and they had one hour to pack their bags before I called the cops. His mom started crying and saying I was ruining their family, but I was done.

I also canceled the two surprises I planned as a gift. I've been secretly paying for the premium open bar package. And upgraded their honeymoon suite to the penthouse. All in all, I was covering about $8,000 worth of upgrades she didn't even know about. Each vendor I call is shocked when I explain this situation. The cake baker actually says, after everything you've done for her. But I just tell them I need to cancel, and they all understand. Some of them even refuse to work with her if she tries to. The venue calls her three days later to confirm cancellation. That's when my phone starts going off crazy. 47 missed calls in an hour. When I finally answer, she's hyperventilating. What did you do to my wedding? She screams so loud, I have to hold the phone away from my ear. The venue wants $12,000 for a last minute booking. The florist won't even return her calls. The photographer is booked. The caterer says they have no record of her event. I let her rant for a solid minute before I calmly explained that all those vendors were my connections, my accounts, my negotiations. You said you didn't want anything from me, remember? She starts sobbing about how the wedding is in 11 days and everything is ruined, and how could I do this to her? You literally told me not to come. I reminded her these Were all my favors to call in, not yours? She tries to guilt trip me, saying I'm ruining the most important day of her life. Frisa, you said good. When I told you I'd have to cancel everything, you hung up on me. She calls me a jealous bitch and says she'll never forgive me. That's fine, I tell her.

But honestly, if she really felt that threatened by me just existing in a bridesmaid dress, then fine. I told her, okay, if that's what you want. She sounded surprised, like she expected me to beg or cry or something. That night, I started going through all my emails. Every vendor communication is in my inbox because I'm the one who's been handling everything. The venue, that's my boss's country club and he gave us the friends and family discount. The florist, she, the client from my job, the photographer, charging $2,000 instead of his usual $6,000. I designed his entire website portfolio for free last year. The caterer, the DJ, the bartenders, even the hair and makeup team, they're all doing this as favors to me, not her. My sister has no idea that every single contract is technically under my name. The next morning, I called Brisa one more time. Just so you know, if I'm not part of the wedding, I'll need to cancel all the arrangements I made through my connections. She immediately snaps back, good, I don't want anything from you. Anyway, she hung up before I could say anything. I don't think she had any clue what that meant. I spent the rest of that day making calls. First, the venue. I explained that I won't be attending the wedding anymore, so I need to cancel the reservation I made. My boss is confused but says no. Problem next, the florist. She's actually offended when I tell her what happened and says she wouldn't work with my sister now, even if she begged. The photographer is booked solid and happily takes another wedding for that date at his full rate. One by one, I cancel everything, the caterer, the DJ, the cake baker.

So I've been helping my older sister Brisa, plan her wedding since the day she got engaged. We're talking eight months of venue tours, cake tastings and colour swatching. Every shade of blush pink known to mankind. She called me her angel sister to everyone, bragging about how she couldn't imagine doing any of this without me. We spent every Sunday together working on centrepieces, addressing invitations, making those little favour bags. Never once did we argue about anything. Then, two weeks before her big day, we're at the final bridesmaid dress fitting downtown. I step out of the dressing room in this dusty rose dress she picked, and I watch her face just completely change. She goes quiet for the rest of the appointment, barely looks at me. That night, I'm meal prepping for the week when my phone rings. We need to talk about the wedding, she says, and her voice is ice cold. I'm thinking maybe there's a vendor issue or something. But then she hits me with, you're out of the wedding party. Actually, don't even come to the wedding at all. She tells me I looked too good in the bridesmaid dress and she won't have me stealing attention on her special all day. I literally laughed because I thought she was joking. We're sisters. I offered to wear a different dress, do my hair different, wear less makeup. Literally anything. But she's dead serious. This is my wedding and my day. I don't want you there. I could have fought her on it, could have called our parents, made it into this whole family drama. But honestly, if she really felt that threatened by me just existing in a bridesmaid dress, then fine. I told her, okay, if that's what you want. She sounded surprised, like she expected me to beg or cry or something. That night, I started going through all my emails. Every vendor communication is in my inbox because I'm the one who's been handling everything. The venue, that's my boss's country club, and he gave us the friends and family discount. The florist, she's a client from my job. The photographer, charging $2,000 instead of his usual six thousand dollars. I designed his entire website portfolio for free last year. The caterer, the DJ, the bartenders, even the hair and makeup team. They're all doing this as favors to me, not her. My sister has no idea that every single contract is technically under my name. The next morning, I called Brisa one more time. Just so you know, if I'm not part of the wedding, I'll need to cancel all the arrangements I made through my connections. She immediately snaps back, good, I don't want anything from you. Anyway, she hung up before I could say anything. I don't think she had any clue what that meant. I spent the rest of that day making Calls first, the venue. I explained that I won't be attending the wedding anymore, so I need to cancel the reservation I made. My boss is confused, but says no problem. Next, the florist. She's actually offended when I tell her what happened and says she wouldn't work with my sister now even if she begged. The photographer is booked solid and happily takes another wedding for that date at his full rate. One by one, I cancel everything the caterer, the DJ, the cake baker, who was doing a five tier for the price of three. I also canceled the two surprises I planned as a gift. I've been secretly paying for the premium open bar package and upgraded their honeymoon suite to the penthouse. All in all, I was covering about $8,000 worth of upgrades she did even know about. Each vendor I call is shocked when I explain the situation. The cake baker actually says, after everything you've done for her. But I just tell them I need to cancel and they all understand. Some of them even refused to work with her if she tries to rebook. The venue calls her three days later to confirm cancellation. That's when my phone starts going off crazy. 47 missed calls in an hour. When I finally answer, she's hyperventilating. What did you do to my wedding? She screams so loud I have to hold the phone away from my ear. The venue wants $12,000 for a last minute Booking? The florist won't even return her calls. The photographer is booked. Caterer says they have no record of her event. I let her rant for a solid minute before I calmly explained that all those vendors were my connections, my accounts, my negotiations. You said you didn't want anything from me, remember? She starts about how the wedding is in 11 days and everything is ruined, and how could I do this to her? You literally told me not to come. I reminded her these were all my favors to call in, not yours. She tries to guilt trip me, saying I'm ruining the most important day of her life. Risa, you said good. When I told you I'd have to cancel everything, you hung up on me. She calls me a jealous bitch and says she'll never forgive me. That's fine. I tell her

My friend autumn asked me to hang out with her during her overnight shift at the pawn shop there had been three robberies at other shops in the area this month and an employee was killed at the last one. I got there at 9 as the last customer was leaving and autumn was locking the front door, explaining we'd only buzz in people who had items on them. The buzzer went off for the first time at 10:30 when autumn buzzed the man in. He walked up to the counter with this big smile, and he needed quick cash for a family emergency and had electronics to sell. But something felt off about how he kept looking around the shop instead of at us while he talked, memorizing where all the cameras were. While autumn examined his old laptop, the man walked around the shop, stopping at the case with the guns, asking if those were real. Autumn said yes, but they kept them locked, and he nodded, then asked about the jewelry case electronic section, like he was cataloging everything valuable. He came back to the counter and after a minute asked how much cash the shop kept on hand for buying items, when autumn looked up nervously and said it varied. He asked if we knew about Luna, the employee who died last week. The way he knew her name made my skin crawl because it hadn't been Released in the news, Autumn's hands started shaking, and she said, no, we didn't know her. He said that was good, because it would be traumatic to lose a friend that way, bleeding out behind the counter while the safe was being emptied. Neither of us had heard that detail, and autumn asked how he knew that. He smiled and said he paid attention to things. He asked if we were alone in the shop, and when autumn said the owner checked the cameras remotely, he looked directly at each camera and counted them out loud, then said, cameras didn't help Luna. My heart was pounding now as he walked to the back area where the guitars hung, running his hands along them, then to the tool section. Picking up a crowbar and feeling its weight, he brought it back to the counter and set it down, saying it was a nice one, good quality. Could probably open anything with it. He asked autumn if she'd ever been robbed before, and when she said no, he said, Luna probably said the same thing before that night. He leaned across the counter and asked if autumn knew what Luna's mistake was. We. We're both frozen, as he said she'd been too slow opening the safe, had fumbled the combination twice because her hands were shaking, and that made everything take longer than necessary. He said delays were dangerous for everyone involved. Adam's hand moved toward the silent alarm, but he grabbed Her wrist, not hard, but firm. And said Luna had tried that too, but the police took 12 minutes to arrive. He let go and stepped back, say, and he needed to make a withdrawal from the safe. All the cash and the good jewelry from the case. Autumn said she couldn't do that, and he said she could and would, because he'd asked nicely once already.

So I gave him the 1950s housewife he wanted. I had been with Craig for three years when he completely ruined my promotion dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. Women today are the problem with everything, he said, twirling his pasta. They don't know how to be real women anymore. They're always trying to wear the pants, competing with men instead of serving them. My grandpa had it right. His woman stayed home, cooked his meals, and didn't talk back. My wine glass stopped halfway to my mouth. Craig, we are literally here to celebrate my promotion. That's exactly what I mean. You care more about your stupid job than making me happy. Back in the day, women knew their place and kept their man satisfied. I looked around the restaurant where we were supposed to be celebrating my success. So you want a traditional relationship, like the actual 1950s? His eyes lit up. Finally you get it. Yes. A real woman who acts like a woman should, the way god intended. Okay, traditional it is. He reached over to grab my hand. See, I knew you would understand. Most women would get all feminist and defensive about this. The next morning, I showed up to breakfast in a full 1950s housewife outfit, complete with pearls and a puffy dress that covered my ankles. Good morning, Mr. Anderson, I said, putting his coffee down. He laughed. Okay, the outfit is cute. But you don't have to call me that. Oh, but I do. In the 1950s, a proper lady always addresses her man respectfully. His smile started to fade that evening when he wanted to go to his friend's party. I shook my head. Oh, no, Mr. Anderson. I can't share a car with you. We're not married. People would think I'm a prostitute. What? That's insane. In the 1950s, married couples needed chaperones. I will have to take the bus and meet you there. The bus? Just get in the car. That would make me a loose woman, Mister Anderson. He had to explain to everyone at the party why we arrived separately. At the party, his friend Kyle asked about my promotion. I turned to Craig. May I answer him, Mister Anderson? Craig's face went red. Just talk to him. As you wish. I turned to Kyle. Mister Anderson doesn't believe women should work. I will be quitting my job soon to focus on cooking and cleaning like a real woman. My mother failed to teach me that my only value is serving a man. Kyle nearly choked on his beer. Dude, what the hell? She's being stupid. Craig muttered. No. Mister Anderson believes modern women are broken. We think we deserve Equality when we should be grateful men even put up with us. I sat quietly, hands folded, only speaking when Craig gave permission. His friends kept staring at him. The real entertainment started at his company picnic. When his boss's wife asked about my job, I smiled sweetly. Mister Anderson says careers make women forget how to be women. Would you like my potato salad recipe instead? It's the only thing I'm good for. I spent the entire event walking three steps behind Craig, staring at the ground, calling him Mr. Anderson, and asking his permission for everything. May I have a hot dog, Mr. Anderson? Just take the damn hot dog. Is that a yes? I need you to say yes or no. His co workers started whispering. When someone asked why I kept calling him Mr. Anderson, I explained happily. Craig says modern women destroyed society by thinking they're equal to men. He wanted a traditional 1950s relationship where I knew my place. His boss overheard Craig. Did you really say that? She's twisting my words. Craig growled, oh, no. Mister Anderson was very clear. He said women should shut up, stay home, and give men sex on demand. The boss's face went ice cold. HR will want to discuss this on Monday, Craig. By week three, Craig was cracking. Can we please have sex? He asked. One night, I gasped to my girls, literally, Mr. Anderson, good girls don't do that before marriage. What would Jesus think? We have been having sex for three years. That was the old me. The new traditional me saves herself for marriage. He punched a pillow. Then came his mother's birthday dinner at Craig's favorite steakhouse. When the Waiter came over. I handed him my menu immediately. Mr. Anderson will order for me. Ladies don't talk to other men. Craig's mom's jaw dropped. Craig, what is going on? Your son wanted a traditional 1950s relationship, I explained down shyly. He says modern women ruined everything by having jobs and opinions. Craig Michael Anderson! His mother's voice could have broken windows. You're trying to control this sweet, successful woman. Mom, she's doing this on purpose! May I speak, Mister Anderson? I asked sweetly. Stop calling me that! But you wanted to be the man of the house. Traditional men are called Mister by their women. His mother yelled at him through the entire dinner, while I sat silently asking Craig for permission to eat each bite. On the drive home, he exploded. Fine, I was wrong. Please just go back to normal. I smoothed my dress carefully. Oh, Mister Anderson, A traditional woman never questions her man's first decision. It would not be proper for me to disagree with you. The vein in his forehead looked ready to pop as I smiled sweetly and walked exactly three steps behind him to his apartment door.

He never let me drive it. The nickname was tomato because it was red and he said it sounded like the brand name. You should have been embarrassed by that name. Ha ha. Do you remember what the logo looked like? I remember it had something like P72. My ex said there were only 72 of those cars in the world. P72? Yeah, and I hated the noise.

He blew it all open. But you didn't tell me any of this. How are we supposed to know? You weren't supposed to know for your own safety. That's why I kept it quiet. And now, because your brother decided to play detective, a journalist who trusted me got doxxed. An entire case got compromised. But still, he's your family. We can't destroy him over a mistake. He destroyed me. I lost my clearance. I lost my team. I lost people's trust. He didn't mean for that to happen. Intent doesn't undo damage. If I did what he did, would anyone let it slide? You're saying he should go to prison? I'm saying someone should finally be held accountable. Because every time someone says he didn't mean to, I'm the one picking up the pieces again.

That's impossible. Your father's phone was destroyed in the accident. It says, come to the lake. I'm waiting. When did you get this? Just now. Three minutes ago. Block that number immediately. Why? What if it's really him? Your father is dead, Emma. We buried him last month. But what if it wasn't him in the casket? What if. Stop! The police confirmed it was him. There's another text. I know you're reading these messages. Someone is playing a cruel joke. It says, ask your mother about the cabin key. What? What Cabin Key? Mom, how would they know about that? Know about what? Mom, you're scaring me. Where are you right now? At Jessica's house. Why? Stay there. Don't go anywhere. I'm coming to get you. The text says she's lying to you. She's always been lying. Turn off your phone now. Mom, there's someone outside Jessica's window. Lock the doors. Call 9 1 1. They're wearing dad's jacket. That's not possible. His jacket was in the car with him. Unless it wasn't him in the car. Emma, listen to me. Whatever you do, don't open the door. They're holding something up to the window. What is it? It's. It's Dad's watch. The one you said burned in the fire. That's not possible. Mom, what's going on? Why did you lie about the watch? I didn't lie. I thought it was destroyed. Jessica's mom just got home. She's going to The door. Tell her not to open it. She already did. There's no one there. Check the window again. They're gone. But they left the watch on the porch. Don't touch it. Too late. There's a note inside. What does it say? Ask her about July 15th. Boost for part two.

Because we are looking for a partner, not a project. And at the end of the day, we're gonna keep focusing on ourselves and on our glow up until we find someone who fuck it's right and treats us how we deserve. Because nobody has time for shitty coffee, shitty sex or shitty relationships. And if it's not bringing you income, inspiration or to orgasm, we don't fucking want it.

I've got temperatures up here for the next few days. Now take it to the floor Tuesday, Wednesday morning, that's when we're in that hard freeze territory. You can see the speeds. Three, six, nine. We're just fine. But a cold front's gonna sock it to us one more time with strong winds blasting in here tomorrow. We have a couple of cold fronts on the way and temperatures will get low, get low, get low, get low. Look at next week. Highs only in the 30s. Very likely we're going to see a hard freeze. And that's why you need to protect your home. To the window, to the wall, and basically everywhere in between, especially the pipes. And could we see a wintry mix? Well, it is possible. I know when you see this pink, you're like, ah, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet coming our way. Well, some sweet, some light freezing rain possible, but light is the keyword here.

Well, I don't, cause I would be weird. But I do think it was so crazy that it really helped my character development. So when I was in middle school, I had a best friend, okay, when I was in sixth grade, we were like. We were like this. And I went to an international school, okay? So, like, basically, new people were coming in and out, like, all the time. Like, sometimes people would only stay for a year, and then sometimes if you're, like, local to the area, you would, like, stay there your whole life. So me and my best friend were like this. But then one year, like, the beginning, I think this was, like, at the beginning of sixth grade, or maybe even in the middle of the year, a new girl came, and she kind of started to join our little group and, like, okay, a trio. Like, I can do this. Then slowly I started to notice that they would, like, gang up on me, like, do two against one. Like, like, little things like hanging out at each other's houses and then, like, telling me how much fun they had, but, like, that I wasn't invited. And then, like, when you'd pick a partner for a project, like, they would pick each other and be like, but not me. We'll call the first friend T and the second friend C. So T&C started being like this and, like, leaving me out from stuff. And then it slowly became, like, they would just completely ignore me. Like, I wasn't part of the group at all. Like, it was just them, too. But then when it was separately, like, when I had a class with T, she would be really, really nice to me. And when I had a class with just C, she would be really, really nice to me. Very mind game stuff. And it got to the point where I was like, okay. Like, I don't do well with being bullied. Like, that's what I felt like. I was like, I'm being bullied. I've never been the type to, like, take it. Like, I need to, I, I need to stand up. Like, I need to say something, even if it means, like, I'm not gonna have any friends for the year. But right when I was deciding, like, oh, I think I'm gonna, like, just call them on their shit, like, I don't care if they completely ditch me and I have no friends for the year, like, I need to, girl, I need to stand up. My dad, my parents were like, guess what

I have to show you everything she did, starting with cupboard No. 1 in the kitchen. You might be like, okay, she put your spices on the rack? No, girl, I bought this for my skincare. This was hidden away in my closet. And maybe I can find a screenshot of, like, what my cupboards used to look like, cause this was not it. And what makes it crazier, I don't know if this was an accident or what, but I'm pretty sure she did it alphabetically. Basil, chili, cinnamon, garlic powder, pepper, red peppers. Yeah, it's in perfect alphabetical order. So I found this, like, stack of hair bands on my vanity table, and I was like, where did you find these? Like, I get that you find hair bands when you're cleaning. This was, like, a lot of hair bands. Very shortly realized not only has our homegirl put in a damn basket in our cupboards, stacked and organized all my ramen, she has also put the proper clips on all of my pasta and rice bags instead of the hair bands I usually use. Also, grow up. He also made me a medicine box. Like, I just know she watched that back to college medicine box that that mom, like, built her daughter. Like, she pulled these from Every different spot of my apartment. Like, none of this stuff was, like, in the cupboard at all. Some was in my bathroom, some was in my bedroom, and now it's all in here. It gets better. She decided to give me baskets for my dishwasher pods and my trash bags hanging on the inside of my cupboard. You showed up with adhesive clips in a dream? Cause it just gets better. Dishwasher brush hung. And this was just a bottle of, like, Dawn dish soap. Put it in a soap dispenser. Let's take a trip to my bathroom really quick. Toothbrush now hanging on the wall. And what I love most about it, it covers a stain. You can kind of see part of it, but there's a stain on this wall from hair dye. The clip covers it. She also hung the towel that used to be wedged in between here and hid the other part of the stain. That's from hair dye. The next thing first, I was like, did she, like, leave me a note? Like, what is this? No note. She just started me a grocery list, ripped out a page from god knows what incredible stuff. The last thing. Like, this is why I. Look, I know she's a mother. She called me out so hard for this. Tell me, why the stack of unopened mail sitting on my counter? Judge? Because. Yeah, girl, like, right? Clock it. Why do I have. Why do I have so much unopened mail. And finally I was like, damn, did she do all that and steal my vacuum? Like. Cause I could not find my vacuum for the life of me. Honestly, at that point I was like, just take it as a tip, like, you deserve it. And then I find it. Hung my vacuum on my storage cupboard. Mind your business. If you see me making a 52 part series on how I fell in love with my cleaning lady. Uh huh. I'm coming for you, Kendra.

So I'm gonna teach you guys today how to lay your baby down and keep them asleep. Most babies fall asleep in our arms when they're really little, but the second we lay them down, they pop awake and it's really hard to get them back to sleep. So one of my tricks is to make sure if you're in this position where you have your arm kind of underneath your baby's back, that you reposition your hands first before you even try to lay down. One hand's gonna go behind the head and one under the bum. So I freed up my back so that my arms not stuck under the baby when I lay down. Next tip is to make sure that when you go to lay your baby down, you don't remove them from your body and just kind of bring them down. It triggers their moral reflex, which makes them feel like they're falling. So instead you hold your baby close to your body and you bend your entire body down so you're gonna go all the way down to the crib, all the way down, and you are gonna pull the hand from behind the bum out and you're gonna put it on their chest. So now I have one hand on the chest and I have one hand behind the head. I'm moving the hand.

What do you do when you're not acting? Streaming. Do you dance in real life? Yes, I've been break dancing since I was seven, but it's been a while since I've danced. Um. Just at home.

Just go back to sleep. Did I believe that? No. Actually, I'm pretty sure there was something under the bed, but I lied to her for her comfort. And then she asked me to check under the bed. And in my head, I was like, ain't no fucking way am I getting out of bed right now to check under it. Instead, I reassured her that there was nothing under the bed, and I told her to go back to sleep. And she tried for a minute. Her eyes fluttered. They. They, like, a little bit, and then they popped right open again. And she was looking at the TV, the TV that was turned off in our dark room. And she goes, mommy, who's that on the TV? And in my head, I'm thinking, dog, I don't fucking know. You tell me. You're the one seeing dead people. Who the fuck is that on the TV? Because I don't see it, but I'm terrified. I don't say that. No, instead, I Say, honey, the TV's turned off. There's no one on the TV. Just go back to sleep. And she falls back asleep eventually. You know who doesn't? Me. Because I'm afraid of what's under the bed now. And I'm wondering who the fuck that was on my TV. On my TV that was turned off. Who was it?

I was just gonna let it go because, you know, I've got plenty of gas cans, but my wife thinks we should call the business book service and then steal our gas can back whenever they come out.

That women are the superior sex. I mean, imagine. Dudes can't even fathom what it's like to live in a woman's body. Imagine going through puberty with all of those hormones, and then that happening. You. And then you have decades where you can't even go a singular month without your body turning on itself. And then you're supposed to, like, grow a human and have a catapult out out of you? No. And then your reward for decades of dealing with that is menopause. Not to mention the expectations of society on that woman who's now created a child with a chest to take care of, on top of being boss babe while maintaining her beauty standards. But, of course, not too beautiful, because if we're too beautiful, then she's dumb, and this is all that she's worth. And during all of that, having to keep their eyes out in parking garages for men. Meanwhile, boys just grow some hair, lose some hair, drink beer, and then have a meltdown when they don't get the attention they think they deserve.

In your poor, pitiful little souls, you haven't won a damn thing. But I'll tell you who did win. That's Charlie. Charlie isn't laying in some cold grave. His body, maybe, but he's not. Charlie is alive, more alive than ever. Because that faithful servant is walking the streets of gold right now. He is walking shoulder to shoulder with the Almighty god himself. Oh, and listen to me clearly. That man is feeling no more pain, no more sorrow, no more grief. Just eternal victory. You didn't take him down. You just handed him the prize that every Christian is striving for. So while you sick, disgusting people are out there chanting, we got Charlie, I want you to hear me loud and crystal clear. You didn't break him. You just crowned him. You just gave him the very thing he devoted his life to reaching. That man is up there rejoicing, while you're down here rotting in your own hate. Now, don't get it twisted. Down here, we are hurting, we are grieving, and we are angry. But that anger, oh, honey child, that's a fire. And that fire, it's about to burn hotter than you will be able to handle. Because we are gonna be picking up Charlie's Sword, we are gonna be strapping on Charlie's shield because we are gonna keep marching forward louder, stronger, and bolder than ever before. So you think you won? Well, congratulations. All you did was ignite the army. And that army is coming.

Americans will turn war into an extreme sport while the military stands back and records it just so that they can show the rest of the world the examples on why not to fuck with us. Geneva Convention would turn into a to do list on every American household fridge. We take that shit so seriously we have Comedy Central sending Kevin Hart to tell us rules for engagement.

Then the next morning, Ryan comes running down the stairs. He runs into my room and he goes, I need your help. There is poop up the wall, on the floor, it's everywhere. And I'm like, what? And he goes, do you need me to get you a picture? Do you wanna see? It's everywhere. And I just look at him for a minute and he goes, can you come help me pick up your dog's shit, please? It was at that moment that I remember he had been sleepwalking the night before, and I turned around and I said, Ryan, um, I think you pooped in your sleep. The look on his face was something like this. What? And he goes, no, I'm pretty sure it was Charlie, our golden retriever. And finally I convince him that he clearly was the one that shit everywhere. So he goes upstairs with a garbage bag and all the cleaning wipes, and all I hear is this mom, I really, really. Hahaha. For the rest of the day, he is freaking trying to figure out how this happened at his age. Quite frankly, I'm a little mortified myself that My almost 16 year old shot himself in his sleep. Anyway, the next night, at around one in the morning, I'm in the bathroom getting ready to go to bed, when all I hear is an explosion of some sorts. Kind of like the Niagara Falls turning on for the first time. When I came out of the bathroom, I saw it. The crime scene of shit. My golden retriever had exploded in my bedroom. A huge disaster. I deal with it, and then I go to bed. So one in the morning, I'm not thinking yet. I start falling asleep. And then a light bulb went off in my head. It occurred to me that maybe, just maybe, it was not the teenager who shot. And that maybe it was indeed the golden retriever. The best part? In three years, my golden retriever has not once walked up those stairs. Because those stairs are terrifying for him. But that night, he thought to himself, oh, god, I'm gonna shit myself. If I shit on the carpet, mom will know. But if I shit in Ryan's room, right up against the wall and down on the floor, they'll think it was him. The golden retriever outspared to my teenager.

He told him to quit being a fucking racist. And the kid put his hands on him, and my son gave him something to think about on the way to the nurse. Now, I picked my kid up from school and took him for ice cream, and my client says, stop telling your kids, if someone hits them, hit them back. You're part of the problem. Hmm? No, I'm not. I'm the solution your kid wasn't ready for. If you think I'm gonna send my child into school like a little lamb and tell him go get an adult in the midst of being mollywapped, absolutely fucking not. This isn't Daniel Tiger's conflict resolution. This is real life. I don't raise bullies, but I'm sure shit not raising a victim who stands there like, please stop hitting me. I'm emotionally aware. My kids gonna pop off like they've been waiting their whole life for the green light. I'm not gonna sit there in the principal's office like, oh, I told him to walk away, cause no, the fuck I didn't. I told him to aim center mass and don't stop until it's over. And if your kids started it, I don't care how it ended. If you wanna raise your child to be a gentle negotiator, go for it. But if they bring that open palm diplomacy into a Hallway fist fight. They're gonna meet my kids. Knuckle biscuits. I'm not sending my kids to school so they can work on their breathing exercises. Mid ass whooping. They're not gonna sit there like I'm feeling unsafe in my body right now. And if you think that way, it's cause your kid loses. Every fight they start cry about it.

Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I stayed home from work last night. We're going through some stuff. Don't worry. We're good. We're fine. Today is a new day. This, that, and the third. I woke up 20 minutes before my alarm, and I thought, this is great. This is great. I'm up early. I'm gonna take a shower, get the kids lunches packed, get him to the bus stop, get home and get some stuff done. You're an asshole, Amanda. You always believe you're gonna have a productive day, you optimistic sun, shiny puke. Just love yourself, girl. Just love yourself that. Yeah. No, no. Taking a shower, I heard the bathroom door open. My son's sweet little sleepy voice telling me he had to pee. Go ahead, buddy. Go pee. I heard him pee. I'm putting conditioner in my hair, heard the toilet flush, heard the sink run. And then as I'm soaping and conditioning my hair, he jerks the shower curtain open, and I feel something hit my leg. I hear the shower curtain close as I'm trying to quickly get the soap out of my eyes. And then I hear the bathroom door slam. Look down, but there's a plastic cup in the tub. Why do you put a plastic cup in the tub? Oh, god, this kid is so weird. I'm washing the front of my body, and I Feel something on my back. Now my hair falls out quite a good deal, so I thought it was a loose hair, but it was annoying, you know, it just. It was like that weird tickly feeling. So I turned my back to the water, and then I didn't feel it anymore. Cool. Got done showering. I'm ready to get out of the tub, and I hear the door crack. And my son says, did you see it, Mommy? See what, buddy? Did you see it, Mommy? Buddy, what did you do? Door slam shut. Oh, my god, this kid is so weird. Open up the curtain. As I go to step out, I look down to see a big hairy spider on my leg. My son caught a spider in a cup and threw it in the shower with me. Do you know how bad it hurts to try to launch yourself out of a tub, smacking at your leg and slam into the wall in front of you? Because I do. Do you know how bad it hurts to slip, trip, and fall on the floor and bust your elbow off that weird baseboard heater? I always get made fun of for saying it, but i'mma say it. The radiator. Do you know how bad that hurts to bust your elbow off that son bitch at 6:00 in the morning? Cause I damn sure do. Do you know how bad it hurts to try to flip over and Crawl across the bathroom floor only to get tangled in a towel and bust your face off a towel rack? Cause I do. And now when my son gets home, I'm going to get gentle, sweet revenge on my sweet little man. He's so cute! I love him so much hahaha.

He told him to quit being a fucking racist. And the kid put his hands on him, and my son gave him something to think about on the way to the nurse. Now, I picked my kid up from school and took him for ice cream, and my client says, stop telling your kids, if someone hits them, hit them back. You're part of the problem. Hmm? No, I'm not. I'm the solution your kid wasn't ready for. If you think I'm gonna send my child into school like a little lamb and tell him go get an adult in the midst of being mollywapped, absolutely fucking not. This isn't Daniel Tiger's conflict resolution. This is real life. I don't raise bullies, but I'm sure shit not raising a victim who stands there like, please stop hitting me. I'm emotionally aware. My kids gonna pop off like they've been waiting their whole life for the green light. I'm not gonna sit there in the principal's office like, oh, I told him to walk away, cause no, the fuck I didn't. I told him to aim center mass and don't stop until it's over. And if your kids started it, I don't care how it ended. If you want to raise your child to be a gentle negotiator, go for it. But if they bring that open palm diplomacy into A hallway fist fight. They're gonna meet my kids. Knuckle biscuits. I'm not sending my kids to school so they can work on their breathing exercises. Mid ass whooping. They're not gonna sit there like I'm feeling unsafe in my body right now. And if you think that way, it's cause your kid loses. Every fight they start cry about it.

And you got so scared, you went to your room and threw away that little my buddy doll you had. I didn't know what was going on. So I took that doll out of the trash and put it back on your dresser and went to work. Well, the next morning, your mother called me, and you in the background, screaming and yelling. And she told me the story. What happened? 7, 7 years old. And she told me the story, what had happened. So I thought it was pretty fucking funny. So I get home, and you'd already had a burial for this damn doll. You'd slice it up with a pair of Scissors and buried it in the backyard. So I waited. You went to sleep. I went out and unburied that doll, stitched it up real good and set it back on the dresser. And then. Nothing funny about childhood trauma. I went to work and waited for the phone call. Well, your mom called me, and you just said, so hysterical you couldn't even make a word. You just crying and bawling your eyes out. And then You burn that damn doll and buried it again. So the next night I unburied it after you went to sleep. You son of a bitch. I super glued the fucking burnt parts back together. Stitched up the little overalls. And you ended up. I was off the next day. See, it was. I took the damn dog, I tied a piece of yarn around it like this. And put it on the top bunk bed on that little safety railing. So when you woke up, you slept on the bottom bunk. And you woke up and it was right there in your face. You're so. I woke up screaming. You wouldn't even get out of the bed. You just kept hitting that doll with your belly. And this is the man you married. Younger stepmother. And you also bit yourself in the ass. Cause I ended up sleeping in bed with you till I was like 12 years old. No, baby, you were in my bed. You were in my room.

Welcome to Cooter Economics 1:01. I'll start off this class by saying the ones that are charging for it are charging way too fucking much, and the ones that ain't are giving way too much away. It's a saturated market. It's about the most saturated market you're gonna find. You can't throw a rock in a crowd without hitting three pieces of cheap Cooter. Now, if you're buying Cooter individually, the going rate on average is about $43. However, if you find a single mom that the dad ain't in the picture, then you're in it. A Dollar General toy, $10 worth of gas, and a little bit of attention. If you find one that thinks her shit don't stink, you'll probably have to spend 100 to 150 on a nice meal and you're still in there anyway, so you're good. Now, if you want to buy a bulk Cooter, okay, if you're buying Costco Cooter, this is how you do it. You're gonna go get a fifth of Tito's, you're gonna fill your boat full of gas, then you're gonna post about it. By Saturday, you're gonna have a boat full of Cooter, and then you're gonna make post about that. This is where marketing comes in. You're gonna make those posts showing off the boat and the Tito's and the Cooter.

And for your seven year old son to pick that moment to say, daddy, sometimes my moves. Now we're gonna do this now. You know, son, I don't really want the first conversation that we have about your privates to be while I'm looking like a drag queen. Hit me in the face with a pillowcase full of loose makeup.

I have a rule in the store. While we are shopping, if you are walking, you have to have your hands on the cart. My other daughter had two hands on the cart to trick me so that her sister could go get a baby brother. This poor woman was just trying to pick out the right type of toilet paper. My sweet, innocent little daughter just comes up and kidnaps her son. The worst part about all of it. Okay, it's gonna sound horrible, but the mother and her child were black, okay? So when my daughter come running up to me with this child, she says, Mommy, Mommy, can we keep the chocolate baby? I have never been so embarrassed in my life.

If you're the type of guy that thinks you should be able to control what your girl wears. Honey, the only thing you should be keeping under control is the amount of times you tell women in bed, oh, this has never happened to me before. And you're the type of guy that'll tell a woman like me, go put on some clothes and get a real job. Does that mean that I could tell you to take off that old trucker's hat, cause that hairline has gone into early retirement? And tell me again why I should have to cover up my skin in order to hide your insecurities? That would be like asking LeBron not to wear his championship ring because you never made varsity basketball. Too soon you'll say it's embarrassing to take a woman out that's wearing something revealing, but it's not embarrassing for you to reveal that you need a spoon to twirl your pasta and you only tip 5%. And when defending your Ben Shapiro bullet points, you'll say things like, well, at least I don't sell my body and then join the military. And it's weird, because the way we look is the exact reason that you do the song and dance to get our attention mention in the first place. Was my body ever a wonderland? Or just some territory for you to control and conquer? So listen, my little conquistador dorks, I know you like to Act like you wrote the book on women. But let's be honest. Any man that says that he knows exactly how to read a woman is always illiterate.

When I was in high school, I had a little white dog named Charlie, and he was my best friend. My mom hated looking after him and always made comments about him being too much to take care of. One night, she joked about giving him away, but I didn't think she was serious. However, the next night I got home late, and when I looked for him, he wasn't there. I searched everywhere but couldn't find him. In that moment, I completely lost it. I remember storming out to my living room and completely lit into my mom. I called her the worst mom in the world and told her she doesn't love me. I said I hope I never see her again and stormed back to my room. She tried to come in, but I kept the door locked and told her to leave me alone. I cried myself to sleep, but the next morning when I got up, I heard something in my closet. When I opened it, Charlie ran out. I was so glad to see him, but then I realized what I had done. I felt so horrible and had to tell my mom how sorry I was. I went out to see if she was home, but she had already left for work. She had to drive to Manhattan, so she left early and came home late most days. I felt So bad. I stayed home from school and just wanted to give her a hug. That day, I remember watching TV when the channel changed itself and I saw the building on fire. I didn't think it was real, but after a few minutes, I realized what was happening. This was on September 11th, and after I watched for a few minutes, I realized that was the building my mom was in. I was trying to just catch my breath and barely heard our phone ringing in the kitchen. I answered it and heard her. She was telling me she loves me and was so sorry for not being good enough. I tried to tell her I was sorry and ask if she was okay. She told me she loves me, and before I could say anything, I heard something loud over the phone. The line cut out, and I asked if she was there. It was silent, and when I looked at the TV, I saw the building collapsing. I'll never forgive myself. If you still have your parents, please go tell them you love them.

Last summer, my parents decided we needed a technology free family bonding road trip to Yellowstone. They announced this plan at dinner, looking way too proud of themselves. No phones, no tablets, no Nintendo Switch. I declared we're going to reconnect as a family and appreciate nature. My 16 year old sister Denki and I just stared at them in horror. A week long road trip with no electronics. They might as well have suggested we travel by covered wagon. But what if there's an emergency, Denki asked, already plotting. We'll have our phones for emergencies only, mom said, but they'll be locked in the glove compartment. The night before we left, Denki and I held an emergency sibling meeting. We were not going down without a fight. Operation Digital Rebellion is a go, she whispered, pulling out a duffle bag full of contraband electronics. We spent hours hiding devices throughout our luggage. Denky sewn a secret pocket into her pillow for her phone. I hollowed out a thick book and stuffed my Nintendo Switch inside. We even hit a portable charger inside a bag of trail mix. Day one started with Dad's enthusiastic announcement. Isn't this great, kids? Look at all this beautiful scenery. Let's play the license plate game. Wow, dad, a Nebraska plate. Riveting, Denky deadpanned while secretly texting her boyfriend through her pillow. By hour 3, mom was getting suspicious. Just because we were being Unusually cooperative about her car games, little did she know I was playing Pokemon under a blanket while pretending to nap. You kids seem awfully quiet back there, she said, turning around, just enjoying the family bonding, mom, I said, quickly shoving my switch under my fake book. Denky had gotten creative with her rebellion. She downloaded audio books and was listening through earbuds she threaded through her hoodie strings. Every time mom asked her a question, she'd pretend to be deep in thought about nature. By Day 2, we'd established an elaborate system. Denky would be the lookout while I gamed. Then we'd switch. We communicated through coughs and sneezes. That meant parents incoming or coast is clear. The funniest part was when dad stopped at this scenic overlook and insisted we all take a family photo. While he was setting up his camera, Denky was frantically trying to finish a level on her hidden phone game. Denky, Smile, Dad called out, just a second. I'm appreciating the natural beauty.

Growing up, my dad had one phrase that he loved. My house, my rules. When I was 16 and wanted to dye my hair purple for junior year, he stood in the bathroom doorway, blocking my path. Not under my roof, Alexis. You want purple hair, get your own place. When my boyfriend asked me to prom, dad made him sit through a two hour interrogation before declaring, no dating until you're 18. My house, my rules. I couldn't even watch P G. 30 teen movies until I was 17 because inappropriate content isn't welcome under my roof. My friends stopped coming over after dad made them sign a behavioral contract to enter our home. He controlled what I wore. No ripped jeans in my house. You look homeless. What I ate vegetarian phase. Not at my dinner table. And my opinions, too. You don't get to disagree with me while you're living rent free. When I got accepted to art school, he laughed. Art degree? Not with my money. You'll study business or nothing. Mom would whisper apologies when he wasn't looking, but never stood up to him. The worst part was his favorite closing line whenever I protested. When you have your own place, you can do whatever you want. Don't like it? There's the door. He'd literally point to the front door, knowing I had nowhere to go. At 17, with $82 in My savings account! Life isn't fair, Princess. The person who pays the bills makes the rules. Remember that. Well, I took student loans and went to art school anyway, living in a studio apartment with three roommates and a family of roaches. Dad called it learning life the hard way. Should have listened to me about that business degree, he'd say during Sunday dinners. While I was building my graphic design portfolio at 3:00am, Dad was getting

Everyone loved my mom's boyfriend Gary, but something about how excited he was to spend time alone with my 15 year old sister Maddie felt wrong. He moved in last year, fix things around the house and offered to teach Maddie to drive since mom work double shifts at the hospital. Happy to help, he'd say. The neighbor said mom was lucky, but those driving lessons were three hours when they should have been one. That wasn't normal. Gary would pick up Maddie when mom was at work or sleeping between shifts. We practice on different roads. Explain. But Maddie was changing. My sister who used to blast music and steal my makeup now wore baggy hoodies every day. One night I heard her crying after a lesson. When I knocked, she said she was fine but her voice was shaking. She'd delete Gary's texts immediately after reading them. Mom was too exhausted to notice anything. Between double shifts and sleeping pills for her insomnia, she barely saw us. She trusted Gary completely because he was helping. Last week she mentioned Gary took Maddie to Springfield for practice. That's two hours away. The week before was Riverside, always somewhere far where nobody knew them. Then yesterday, I walked past the bathroom and heard Maddie throwing up. She'd been doing that after lessons lately. I found pregnancy tests hidden in her trash wrapped in toilet paper, both negative. But why did She need them. Why was she so scared she might be pregnant? Something was seriously wrong here. Last Tuesday, I was putting groceries in Gary's car when I found a hotel key card in the door pocket. Why would Gary have this from last week's lesson when I asked him about it later?

My mother in law, 60th was coming up and I volunteered to plan this huge birthday party weekend in wine country. We're talking 10 people, fancy dinner, the whole deal. I spent months researching this upscale place that was also a winery and made reservations way in advance. Day comes and we show up two hours early because we figured we'd do some wine tasting first. The place was completely empty when we checked in. So I asked if maybe they could seat us earlier. They said no, they were too understaffed, whatever, no big deal. We grab some wine and listen to the live music outside. About 20 minutes before our reservation time, I get this text saying we can come get seated. Perfect timing because it was starting to drizzle. We walk over to the hostess and she drops this bomb on us. Cause it's raining and our table is outdoors. They can't seat us tonight. I'm standing there trying not to lose it. I explained that I made this reservation months ago. We've been waiting here for 2 hours and nobody told me this was an outdoor table that could get cancelled for weather. There was no indoor or outdoor option when I booked. This is for a 60th birthday party. I asked if they could split us between smaller tables inside. The manager just keeps shrugging and saying there's nothing they Can do because they can't control the weather. Like that's my fault. Somehow I finally snapped and told them what they could have done was not reserve a table to a large party that they couldn't guarantee. The manager literally shrugged at me again. So we leave and it's Saturday at six PM every other restaurant is booked solid. I had to drive to the grocery store and cook a full dinner for 10 people from scratch. My mother in law's birthday dinner turned into me frantically making pasta in her kitchen while everyone pretended it was fine. I emailed the manager asking if they could comp anything because our experience was.

She's more of a team player. Then corporate called asking why their new regional director was quitting. I've been grinding at Peterson marketing for three years. 60 hour weeks, campaigns that save struggling accounts. When the regional director position opened up, everyone knew I was the obvious choice. Everyone except my boss, Mister Hayes. Friday afternoon, he called me into his office with Jessica, my coworker who'd been there eight months. After careful consideration, Hayes announced, we're promoting Jessica to regional director. Can I ask why? Jessica is more of a team player. You frankly lack the positive energy we need, Daniel. Jessica nodded sympathetically. I'm sure there will be other opportunities. Hayes didn't know was that I've been interviewing with Meridian Corp, Peterson Marketing's biggest client, responsible for 40% of our annual revenue. I've been secretly interviewing for their new creative director position. The final interview was scheduled for Monday. Congratulations, Jessica, I said calmly. I'm sure you'll do great. He's looked surprised by my reaction. He'd probably expected me to argue or make a scene. Monday morning, I sat across from Meridian's CEO, Sarah Chen, discussing my vision for their marketing strategy. She'd been impressed with my work on their campaigns and wanted me to lead their entire creative division. When can you start? She asked after offering me the position. Two weeks, I said, I just need to wrap up some projects. That afternoon, I submitted my resignation. Letter to Hays. Professional brief effective immediately. In two weeks. He called me into his office immediately. What's this about? You can't just quit because you didn't get promoted. I'm not quitting because of the promotion. I said I'm quitting because I got a better job. Better job? Where? Meridian Corp. Creative director position. Hayes's face went White. Meridian? They're our biggest client. I'm aware. Tuesday morning, Jessica started her new role by immediately scheduling a team meeting to discuss collaborative synergies and optimizing our creative workflow. The buzzword bingo was painful to watch. Wednesday, Sarah Chen called Hays directly. We need to discuss the Peterson account. She told him we're not satisfied with the current creative direction. Hays scrambled to reassure her, probably promising better results and closer attention to their needs. Thursday, the bomb dropped. Sarah called Hays again. We've decided to bring our marketing in house. Daniel will be heading up the team. We'll be terminating our contract with Peterson effective next month. I wasn't in the office when this call happened, but according to my friend Mike, Hays dropped his coffee mug and stained his white shirt. Friday afternoon, Hays called me frantically. Daniel, we need to talk. There's been a misunderstanding about your resignation. No misunderstanding. I said I started Meridian on Monday. About the promotion. Maybe we made a hasty decision. Jessica isn't quite ready for the responsibility. What happened to being a team player? Long pause. Look, Meridian represents 40% of our business. If they leave. That sounds like a Jess

My stomach sank. What bracelet? She pulled out her phone and showed me a receipt. Three thousand dollar custom gold bracelet with your birthstone. Delivered four months ago. I'd never seen it in my life. My mom suddenly got very interested in her coffee cup. Dad started scrolling through his phone like nothing happened. The air in the restaurant felt thick with tension. Mom, I said slowly, did you. You sign for a package addressed to me? Her face went red. We thought it was a mistake. Grandma sends so many things. A mistake. Grandma's voice could cut glass. I had it engraved with his name and track the delivery myself. I watched my parents exchange that look. The same guilty look they've been giving each other for months whenever grandma brought up gifts or money. I thought I was being paranoid. But now everything was starting to make sense. Show me the tracking information. Dad interrupted, trying to sound authoritative. Grandma scrolled through her phone. Delivered to your front door on March 15th at 2:47 p m. Signed for by Leora Hensley. She looked directly at my mom. That's you, isn't it, Leora? My mom's hands started shaking. I, I don't remember every package that comes to the house. You don't remember a three thousand dollar piece of jewelry? Grandma's eyebrows shot up. That's when I noticed my sister's new tennis bracelet sparkling on her wrist. The same design, the same stones, the same everything. My stomach dropped. I'd seen Alara wearing it for weeks, bragging to her friends about how she'd treated herself after getting good grades. Alara's idea of treating herself was usually a five dollar coffee, not luxury jewelry. Alara, I said, staring at her arm, where did you get that? She yanked her sleeve down faster than I'd ever seen her move. I, um, saved up for it. Alara works part time at a smoothie shop, making $12 an hour. She spends most of her paycheck on makeup and clothes. There was no way she had $3,000 saved up. How long did you save? I pressed, feeling my anger building. Like a few months, she mumbled, not making eye contact. A few months of smoothie shop money bought you a three thousand dollar bracelet? Mom jumped in. Alara's been very responsible with her money lately. Really? I turned to my parents because last month she asked me for $20 for gas money. The month before that she needed $50 for textbooks. Just last week she was complaining about being broke. Dad cleared his throat. Warren, you're being dramatic. Maybe Alara got a bonus. Or from a smoothie shop. I cut him off. Alara, what's the most expensive thing you've ever bought with your own money? She fidgeted with her napkin. I don't know. Maybe my phone.

We're giving her the wrong baby. Did she just say wrong baby? I was lying in my hospital bed, exhausted from 16 hours of labor when I heard those words through the thin nursery wall. My daughter had been born three hours ago and I was waiting for them to bring her back from her routine Newborn check up. The nurses thought I was sleeping, but I was wide awake, too excited to rest after finally meeting my little girl. Through the crack in the door, I could see two nurses standing over the baby stations holding tiny plastic wristbands in their hands. The younger nurse, Sarah, looked panicked as she whispered urgently to her supervisor. Mrs. Peterson in room 3, 14 is supposed to get baby Girl Williams, we accidentally put baby Girl Thompson's bracelet on the wrong infant. If we don't fix this now, she'll take home someone else's child. My blood turned to ice as I realized they were talking about me. I was Mrs. Peterson in Room 3, 14, and I've been waiting to hold my daughter for what felt like forever. The supervisor, an older woman with graying hair, was examining two nearly identical newborns lying side by side in their plastic bassinets. Both babies had similar birth weights. Both were healthy girls born within an hour of each other, and both had somehow gotten their identification mixed up during The chaos of a busy delivery night. Sarah's hands were shaking as she explained how the mix up happened. Baby Thompson was born at eleven forty seven PM to the mother in room 318, but her wristband fell off during the vitamin K injection. When we put a new one on, we accidentally used the label printer that was set to Mrs. Peterson's information. I stayed perfectly still, pretending to sleep while listening to them debate how to handle the situation without anyone finding out about their mistake. The supervisor was clearly trying to avoid paperwork and potential lawsuits that would come from admitting they'd nearly sent home the wrong babies. Let's just switch the bands quietly and tell both mothers their babies had extended monitoring, she said, dancing around nervously. Neither family will know what happened and we can avoid.

I named the dog after her instead. When I found out I was pregnant, Jake's mom, Patricia, immediately started making lists, not baby shower lists or nursery ideas, but actual baby name lists that she texted me every single day at 7 a. M. Sharp. Good morning, sweetie. Here are today's suggestions. Patricia Rose, Patricia Grace, Patricia Bell. She wasn't even being subtle about it. Jake thought it was sweet that his mom was excited. I thought it was completely insane. This woman had opinions about everything from what I ate to how I folded laundry. But naming my kid after herself was crossing a line I didn't know existed. When I tried talking to Jake about it, he just shrugged and said his mom had always been involved and that's just how their family worked. By month 6, Patricia was showing up at our apartment with baby clothes that all had P names embroidered on them. Penelope, Priscilla, Paisley. She'd hold them up and say things like, won't little Patricia look adorable in this? I started hiding the clothes in our bedroom closet because seeing them made my blood pressure spike and my doctor was already worried about that. The breaking point came when we were registering at target. Trisha insisted on coming with us, which should have been a red flag. We're scanning cribs and bottle warmers, having a normal time when she grabs the registry gun right out of My hands and starts adding stuff. Personalized blankets with Patricia stitched in pink letters, wall letters spelling out.

I'm 18 and heading to college next year while dad designs million dollar homes. We barely have time to text anyone, let alone hide secret conversations. She goes, transparency builds stronger families. Sounds like something from a self help podcast, but here we are. She demands our phones right there at breakfast and starts scrolling through everything, even checking our recently deleted photos. This will bring us closer together. She announces her phone vibrates and she checks it running to meet my sister for coffee. Dad suggests Starbucks near his office, but she says no. Her sister prefers that place across town. For weeks now, she's been weird about her phone, always keeping it face down, taking calls in the garage. Says it's about some surprise party she's planning. She doesn't realize she just played herself. First week and I have to explain every discord message to mom for forty five minutes straight. She wants to know who frogging Plant 67 is and why he's sending memes about depression. It's my lab partner joking about our chemistry grade.

I was checking a student's temperature when I heard him tell his friend about his stepdad's boxing lessons. What he said next made me call 9 1 1. I've been a school nurse for 15 years. You hear all sorts of things when kids think adults aren't listening. That Thursday afternoon in the health office, I overheard two boys discussing something that would land a man in prison. Kai was waiting for his friend to finish getting his inhaler when the other boy pointed at Kai's arm. What happened there? That's from boxing practice with my stepdad, Kai said. Rolling up his sleeve. I saw more bruises running up his arm and my stomach just dropped. Doesn't that hurt? His friend asked. Yeah, yeah, especially when he's been drinking. He won't let me block, says real men don't flinch. I literally froze behind my desk. I was about to interrupt when Kai said something that made my blood freeze. He kept talking like this was totally normal, describing Sunday mornings when his stepdad was hungover, how he'd make Kai stand still for stomach punches, how it was supposed to make him tough. His friend looked scared, but Kai didn't even notice. He explained that his mom worked weekends and didn't see it happen. When she asked about bruises, the stepdad told her Kai needed to toughen up. She believed him. My hands were shaking because I knew this wasn't boxing. This was straight up abuse. How long has this been happening? I asked and both boys jumped because they didn't know I was listening. Since Christmas break. He moved in right before and said he'd make me strong like him. That was only three months ago. But what he said next changed everything. Yesterday I threw up in class cause my ribs hurt so bad. Told the teacher I ate something bad. That's when I knew this was escalating fast. I called Child Protective Services right after those boys left my office. A student just described being beaten by his stepfather. He thinks it's boxing training. The child vomited yesterday from rib pain. They classified it as emergency response within 48 hours. A social worker went to Kai's house while his mom was at work. The stepfather answered the door and tried to explain every.

When I asked what allowance, his face went white. For four months, I've been grinding three jobs tutoring high school kids, weekend event staffing and bar shifts until 2:00am, classes until three PM, then straight to tutoring until 6. Quick dinner of instant noodles, then bar work until closing. I get home at 3:00am, study until 5, sleep for two hours, repeat. Surviving on ramen packets and day old bread. When textbooks cost $400 each, I photocopy pages at the library. My friends go out Thursday nights while I'm serving drinks to businessmen who tip in singles. My bank account never goes above $200. Every dollar is calculated. $50 for groceries, $30 for laundry. I wear the same three shirts, and my shoes have holes I cover with duct tape. Meanwhile, my sister Mariah floods Instagram from Paris. Designer coffee at trendy cafes, weekend trips to Monaco. New Dior dresses with captions like mom always knows exactly what I need. Hashtag blessed, hashtag fashion life. When I begged mom for even $200 for groceries, she sighed heavily. Money's tight. Your father's practice is struggling. Paying your tuition is already stretching us. I worked harder, picked up extra shifts, skipped meals to save money. Last Friday, everything changed. I was carrying cocktails when the room started spinning. I remember reaching for the bar to steady myself. Then nothing. I woke up in a hospital bed with an IV. The doctor was Stern, you collapsed from exhaustion and malnutrition. Your blood sugar was dangerously low. My bar manager visited, looking guilty, even working doubles every weekend, the rest of the month off. That meant losing $1,200 in income I desperately needed. My friend visited with groceries and made me spaghetti. While eating the first real meal I'd had in weeks, he said something that shattered my world. Your dad's a surgeon with a luxury car. You went to private school. How is your sister affording Paris? If money's so tight, you're working yourself into the hospital? That night, I called Mariah directly. Just checking in. How's Paris? Amazing. Mom just sent me the cutest Chanel bag for my birthday next month. My stomach dropped. How are you managing financially? Paris must be expensive. Oh, I don't worry about that. Mom transfers me about $3,000 a month, plus extra whenever I need something special. $3,000 a month plus extras? While I was told there wasn't a single dollar to spare. At Sunday dinner, when dad asked about my allowance, I watched our family explode. What do you mean? Dad's voice was confused. I've been sending $2,000 every month since you started school. Mom kept cutting her pot roast, not looking up. Where is Henry's money? Dad asked mom. Silence stretched forever. I haven't sent any money to Henry. What? Why not? I've been keeping it for Mariah. She needs it more. She's studying fashion in Paris. It's expensive. She needs to look the Part dad's face turned white. You've been withholding Henry's allowance, letting him work himself into a hospital while secretly sending thousands to Mariah for shopping. Mariah has potential. She's special. She's delicate. Henry is exactly like you. He'll be fine. He doesn't need help. And Henry doesn't have potential. He's studying

I'm legally blind in my right eye, but the military didn't know that because I memorized the eye chart during my physical. Basic training was a nightmare. Every time we hit the range, I'd spray bullets everywhere except the target. My drill sergeant thought I was the worst shooter he'd ever seen. Other recruits started calling me stormtrooper because I couldn't hit anything. The drill sergeant would yell, where are you aiming, Thompson? And I'd point at the target while my shots hit the dirt 20 feet to the right. One time I accidentally shot the target in the lane next to mine and got excited thinking I'd finally hit something. The night before final qualification, I was panicking. You need to hit 23 out of 40 targets to pass. My best score was four. I was going to wash out and disappoint my whole family who thought I was becoming a real soldier. That's when I met Kowalski, this farm kid from Iowa who could thread a needle with a rifle. He felt bad for me and offered to help. During our final practice session, Kowalski noticed I kept closing my left eye and aiming with my right. When I told him I could barely see out of that eye, he looked at me like I was insane. Dude, you've been using your bad eye this whole time. He taught me to switch to left handed shooting. In 30 minutes, suddenly I could actually see the targets. It was like putting on glasses for the first time. I managed to hit 15 targets during practice, which felt like a miracle. Qualification day arrived and I was terrified. The range master assigned shooting positions randomly. By pure luck, I got placed right next to Kowalski. Here's where it gets weird. About halfway through the test, a massive dust storm rolled in. Visibility dropped to almost nothing. Range master should have stopped the test, but he was retiring that day and wanted to get it over with. In the chaos and dust, Kowalski and I ended up shooting at each other's targets by mistake. His incredible aim was hitting my target while my decent but not great shooting was hitting his. When the dust cleared and they scored the targets, I had somehow shot a perfect 40 out of 40. The range master was so shocked he made them recount three times. Kowalski scored a 23, exactly passing, but way below his usual performance. He winked at me and whispered, storms make everything confusing. I graduated as the surprise top marksman of our class, got a medal and everything. 20 years later, I still can't hit the broadside of a barn, but my military record says I'm an expert shooter. Sometimes the best qualification is just really good timing and a friend from Iowa.

After my car accident, I decided to pretend I couldn't remember who anyone was. No memory, no recognition, nothing. Just blank stares and polite confusion. The doctor said I'd hit my head hard, but they expected a full recovery. I didn't tell them I remembered everything the second I woke up. What I didn't tell anyone was that before the crash, I'd already been planning to distance myself from half my family. They only showed up when they needed some rides, babysitting, money, a place to stay. I was the reliable one, the you're so strong girl. But I was tired. So when the nurse asked if I remembered my name and I said no, I watched the panic ripple through the room like a stone hitting water. My mom cried immediately. My little brother sat down hard and held my hand. But others, they looked easy, like they didn't know how to function without the version of me that gave and never asked for anything back. They brought in my cousin Mandy, who once asked to borrow $2,000 and ghosted me. When I said no, she walked in with fake tears and a brand new purse. You don't remember me, she said. I shook my head. She blinked, paused and said, well, I guess it's for the best. Maybe now you'll stop being so dramatic about everything. I made a mental note and watched her leave like She had better things to do. Next came Uncle Todd, who never missed a family dinner when I was cooking but always forgot my birthday. You know me, he said, chuckling. I used to throw you in the pool at barbecues. I just stared at him. He sighed and said, well, if you don't remember, I guess there's no point bringing up that loan. You never paid me back. There was no loan. He left 10 minutes later. But my mom, she stayed all night, held my hand and told me stories even when I didn't respond. My brother brought my favorite book without being told. My aunt, who never asked me for anything, brought old photos. And when I said I didn't recognize her voice. Two weeks passed by. Then the doctors had started to worry my amnesia wasn't following the right trajectory. I kept saying I remembered little things, random details like how to play piano or the name of my first pet, but never people. That's when I ended it. I told them it was all coming back slowly, one face at a time. I played the part until I was home, out of the hospital and back on my feet. Then I quietly cut ties with people who vanished the second I wasn't useful. I stopped answering their texts, let calls go to voicemail, stopped showing up to the parties where I was expected to smile and carry everything. And I didn't explain myself because the Smartest thing I ever did was give my family the chance to love me when they thought I had nothing to offer. And the ones who did, they're still here.

When did your parents favoritism come back to bite them? I'm not even gonna sugarcoat it. My brother Caleb was the golden boy since day one. Born three years before me, walked early, talked early, never got in trouble. He played piano by 5, ran track by 10, got scouted for college football before he was old enough to drive. My parents treated him like he was made of gold. Me, I like to draw. I was quiet, sensitive. I guess they called it being dramatic. When I brought home a B+, my dad would sigh and say, why can't you apply yourself like Caleb? Caleb could crash the car and it was the other driver's fault. Caleb could miss curfew and it was boys will be boys. I stayed out 5 minutes too late one time and got grounded for a week. And it wasn't even just rules, it was how they looked at him with that glow I got the leftovers of their attention. Always just tolerated. He got a brand new Jeep at 16. I used it once, got chewed out for leaving a soda can in the cup holder, bought my own crappy car with money I made working part time at a bookstore. They didn't even ask what colour it was. Caleb went off to college on a full ride and still got monthly deposits from mom. I had to fight just to get faps of forms filled out. They Told me art degrees aren't real degrees. I got one anyway. Hustled freelance jobs, slept on couches, built my own little world with zero help. Then came the wedding. Caleb met this girl, real Instagram couple vibes. My parents were obsessed with her. They paid for a full destination wedding in the Bahamas, custom suits, photographers, the whole thing. I wasn't even invited to the rehearsal dinner because there wasn't enough space. Meanwhile, I eloped with my girlfriend of four years. We signed the papers, ate tacos and went home. My mom didn't even call. My dad texted, congrats, I guess. Fast forward 6 years. I hadn't heard from Caleb in a while. He stopped posting on social media, which was weird. Then I got a call from our cousin. Hey, you heard about Caleb? Apparently he got laid off and had been spiraling gamble drinking. His wife left him, took the kids, filed a restraining order. I thought it was gossip until mom called me sobbing. Caleb had moved back in with them. Jobless, depressed, owing 70 K in debt. My dad had already drained half the retirement to help him get back on his feet. My mom was picking up overnight shifts at the hospital. Again, at 62, Dad sold his truck. Then came the day I came home for the first time in years. I pulled into the driveway, Caleb's Jeep, the same one they gave him in high school, rusted and half disassembled on the lawn. The perfect house looked like it hadn't seen paint since 2005. I walked in. Mom looked old, like scared old. Dad was pacing. Caleb was on the couch, eyes bloodshot, unshaven, yelling at some video game. No, hello. No, good to see you. Just a grunt. We sat down for dinner. It was quiet. Then mom asked, can you you help us? She didn't mean emotionally. She meant money. They needed $40,000 or the bank was taking the house. I said nothing. I just looked at Caleb, this man child with the sunken eyes and stained shirt, and I thought of every time I had to convince myself I mattered. Every time I cried in my room while they cheered for his touchdowns, every time they looked through me. Then my dad, my stoic dad started crying, like full on shoulder shaking, sobbing. He said we backed the wrong horse. And I swear to god my fork stopped halfway to my mouth.

When I was 14, my dad surprised me with a laptop for Christmas. I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Finally, I could do school projects, watch shows and even start writing the little stories I loved. But right after handing it to me, he said, oh, and I've installed parental software on it just so you're safe. I didn't think much of it at first. I wasn't doing anything bad anyway. I was googling how to survive algebra and binge watching old TV shows. My dad would casually check my browsing history every now and then. And honestly, it made me feel like he cared, like he wanted to protect me. But then as high school went on, my world started to get heavier. I made friends who weren't the popular kids but felt like my people. There was Sarah, who struggled with eating and hated how she looked. Jason, who was terrified of admitting he liked guys. And Lily, who was constantly caught between her parents screaming matches. We weren't reckless. We were just surviving. And the group chat we made became our lifeline. It was the only place we could be raw and real about everything. I remember one night after another anxiety spiral. I typed out, I feel like I'm drowning in school and I don't know how to tell anyone. My friends responded instantly with love, advice and stupid memes to make. Me laugh. For once I didn't feel broken. I felt understood. But one evening I left my laptop open after finishing an essay. My dad went in to make sure it was running okay and instead he found our chat. He didn't skim it. He screenshot page after page. I found out he spent hours reading through months of our conversations, every confession, every event, every secret. The next day he sat me down with this grave look on his face and said, I'm worried about your friends. Some of these things sound dangerous. And then without asking me, he forwarded the screenshots to Lily's mom and even called Sarah's dad. By Monday, the fallout hit. Sarah showed up to school furious saying her parents were now watching her every bite of food. Jason stopped replying to any of us because he thought someone would out him next. Lily, she wouldn't even look at me. Our group chat was dead. Within days, the safe place we built was gone. My dad told me he did the right thing, that he might have prevented something terrible and maybe he did. But all I could feel was betrayal because he didn't just protect us, he exposed us. After that, I stopped sharing with him. When I cried myself to sleep because of panic attacks, I made sure he never heard. When I felt like I couldn't breathe in class, I pretended I was fine. He could check my laptop, my history, Even my texts. But he'd never find the real me again. And that's the thing about teenagers. It's not that we don't want to tell our parents. It's that the moment we feel like we can't trust them with our truth, we learn to keep everything locked away, even the parts that matter most.

Dad left me at Grandpa's house when I was 11 because his new wife didn't want me around. I thought it was the worst thing ever. But Grandpa taught me everything about farming and business. See, Grandpa wasn't just some old farmer. He owned 500 acres of prime agricultural land worth millions. When dad was growing up, Grandpa was an alcoholic who barely kept the farm running. But by the time I arrived, he'd gotten sober and turned everything around. For seven years, it was just me and Grandpa. He taught me how to work cattle, manage crops, handle finances and run a business. We'd wake up at 5:00am every day, work until sunset, then he'd help me with homework. He never missed a single school event. When he died, he left me everything. Not just the land, the house, the equipment, the bank accounts, everything. I was 18 and suddenly owned more than most people see in a lifetime. Dad didn't even come to the funeral. Didn't call to check on me. Nothing. I spent the next 15 years building Grandpa's legacy. I turned the ranch into a successful agritourism operation. Many families come stay for weeks, learning farm life. I also run a farmers market, sell organic beef and lease land to other farmers. Last year I cleared 800,000 dollar profit. Dad Never called once in 15 years. Not on my birthday, not on holidays. Nothing. I sent him a graduation invitation when I finished my agriculture degree. He didn't show. When I got married three years ago, I didn't even bother inviting him. Then last week, out of nowhere, dad shows up at my door. Not to apologize, not to reconnect. He wanted to talk business. Turns out his precious daughter, my half sister, who I've met exactly twice, struggling financially. Her husband lost his job, they're behind on their mortgage and she needs a fresh start. Dad figured I could just hand over some land and give her a management position. Family sticks together, he says with a straight face. The audacity was unbelievable. This man who abandoned his eleven year old son was lecturing me about family loyalty. I told him I'd think about it, hoping he'd get the hint and leave. Instead, he started texting me multiple times, daily. Detailed messages about which parcels of land would be perfect for his daughter. Suggestions about what roles she could fill in my business. Even ideas about where she and her husband could build a house. The messages got more demanding each day. She deserves this opportunity. Grandpa would have wanted this. You owe the family. It was like he thought my property was some kind of family commune he could just redistribute. After a week of constant harassment, I'd had enough. I called my friend Samuel, who's a local Police officer and asked him how to get a trespass order. Thirty minutes later, I walked out of the station with legal paperwork in hand. Then I asked another close friend, Peter, to take a road trip with me. I need backup for a family reunion. I told him. He didn't ask questions, just grabbed his keys. It took us 10 hours to drive to Dad's house. I needed that time to clear my head and plan exactly what I was going to say. Peter kept offering to drive, but I needed something to do with my hands while I processed everything. We pulled up to Dad's modest

My brother texted, stay away from us. I replied, done. Then I withdrew my name as guarantor for their new house mortgage. I'm the family's designated adult. The one who gets late night calls for rides. The one who co signs things. My brother Robert is 29, charming, lives on impulse. His fiance Bethany, is intense, obsessed with social media. I never warmed to Bethany. She had this way of complimenting that felt like a slap. It's amazing that you're so stable and practical. Her smile never reached her eyes. Three months ago, they found their dream house in a neighborhood they couldn't afford. Their income wasn't enough for the mortgage. Robert asked me to be the guarantor. A massive 30 year financial risk. I had a lawyer draft a simple agreement with two key clauses. If they defaulted, I could take over their equity for what I paid. And my guarantee was contingent on mutual respect and good faith. Any defamation would be grounds for immediate withdrawal. Robert barely glanced at it. We're brothers. Good faith is a given. We signed it in front of a notary. At a family barbecue last weekend, Bethany came over. Maybe tipsy, stood too close. You're always so serious. You to try to have some fun. It made me uncomfortable, so I walked away. Two days later, my phone exploded with a text from Robert. Bethany had confessed. I've been making her uncomfortable. For months, she claimed I cornered her, whispered she was too good for him, that she should be with a real man who could provide. The accusations were so specific, so venomous. This wasn't a misunderstanding. This was targeted character assassination. I tried calling Robert. No answer. Then the final message. I can't believe you'd do this to us. Bethany is a wreck. Just stay away from us. After 29 years together, my brother was gone. A strange calm settled over me. I texted back. Done. My next call was to the mortgage advisor. Due to a significant personal conflict, I am formally withdrawing as guarantor. Sir, this will almost certainly lead to denial of their entire mortgage application. I am aware of the consequences. Three days later, frantic banging on my door at ten PM. Robert looked like he hadn't slept in days. What did you do? The loan is denied. You torpedoed the whole thing. You told me to stay away. I'm staying away from your finances, too. That was personal stuff. Bethany was upset. You don't ruin someone's future over a fight. A fight is arguing about who helps dad clean gutters. This. It was character assassination. And you believed her? Instantly, without question. His phone buzzed. Bethany's voice. Is he fixing it? Make him fix it. You have to call the bank, Robert demanded. Tell them it was a mistake. No, I'm not a light switch you can flick on and off. You don't get to Treat me like a monster in a bank. In the same week, the family pressure campaign started. Immediately, mom called families work through things, but Bethany launched a smear campaign, spinning stories about my growing jealousy and erratic behavior. Then a certified letter arrived from their lawyer demanding I reinstate the guarantee or face legal action. I was panicking until my girl

Then she stormed back to the restaurant, claiming that the soup was too hot and that the lid of the takeout box had melted. The 24 year old cashier, Janelle Burland, refunded her and offered to replace the meal, but Martinez wouldn't listen. She continued to verbally abuse her child and other customers in front of them. Janelle remained calm and asked her to stop the abuse and leave, otherwise she would call the police. Unexpectedly, the customer suddenly poured the almost boiling hot soup onto Jonell's face. When Jonell realized what had happened, she quickly ran to rinse her face, but the hot soup still caused severe burns on Jonell's face and her nose and eyes were bleeding. Subsequently, the police arrived at Martinez's residence and arrested her. At the hearing, Martinez refused to plead Guity sheep, paid a bail of $5,000 and was released later that day.

The landlord started laughing. My roommate's boyfriend, Wesley, had been planning this moment for months, ever since he started staying over back in June. He'd been telling his boys about how he was finessing his way into a free apartment. He even started forwarding his mail here to establish what he called residency rights. The relationship wasn't even official before Wesley started making his move. He'd walk around my apartment, well, what he thought was going to be his apartment, measuring rooms and telling his cousin which wall would be perfect for his TV setup. Melanie's been carrying this dead weight for too long, he'd mutter while eating my groceries. Time for her to learn she doesn't need a roommate anymore. So there I was, standing in my own living room on a Thursday night. The whole place smelled like the Cologne Wesley bathed in. Wesley showed up with his cousin Mitchell and two duffel bags, already acting like he owned the place, both of them looking like they were ready to physically move me out if needed. Melanie, I hope you found somewhere else to stay, Wesley said, dropping his bags by the door. This is happening tonight. You've been taking advantage of my girl's kindness for long enough. I stayed quiet, scrolling through my phone, let him have his moment. Moment? Melanie sat on the couch, avoiding eye contact with everyone. Wesley had been working on her for Weeks convincing her that I was holding her back, that they needed their privacy, that couples shouldn't have roommates. She'd started parroting his words recently. Maybe it's time for a change. Maybe we've outgrown this arrangement. Classic Wesley manipulation. The man didn't even have his own place. He been couch surfing. Before he latched onto Melanie, Wesley pulled out a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket. I printed out this 30 day notice. But honestly, you should just go tonight. Make this easy on everyone. Mitchell nodded like this was all perfectly legal. Smart move, Wesley. She's had a free ride long enough. I looked at the paper and almost laughed. He downloaded some random eviction template and just wrote my name on it in pen. Melanie finally spoke up, her voice barely a whisper. Maybe we can give her the weekend at least. Wesley shot her a look that made her shut up immediately. Nah, baby, we discuss this. She goes tonight. That's when I made the call. Hey, Mister Sanders, I said, putting him on speaker. Could you come up to 2C? We have a situation here. Wesley's chest puffed out. Good. Call the landlord. I'm taking over this lease. Anyway, Melanie and I are common law now. Five minutes later, Mister Sanders walked in with his master keys jingling. He was this 60 year old Brooklyn native who'd owned the building for 30 years. He took one look at the scene. Wesley with his bags. Mitchell Trying to look intimidating, Melanie shrinking into the couch and me standing there calm as could. What's going on here? Mister Sanders asked, though his slight smirk told me he already knew. Wesley stepped forward with all the confidence of someone who'd watched too many law shows. I'm moving in and she's moving out. I've been living here for three months, which makes me a tenant. Melanie and I are together, so I'm taking over her half of the lease. Mister Sanders looked at Wesley like he just said the earth was flat. Then he started laughing. Not a chuckle, but a full belly laugh that went on for a solid 30 seconds. Leslie's face started twitching. What's so funny, old man? Mr. Sanders wiped his eyes and pulled out his phone. Let me show you something, son. He pulled up a document. This is the lease for apartment two C. See that single name? That's not Melanie. That's not

Two weeks after my suicide attempt, I was finally stable enough to have visitors. But when I heard my sister Ashley's voice in the hallway, something made me keep my eyes closed. She walked in with my mom, both whispering like I was already dead. Maybe this is a blessing in disguise, Ashley said. She's been nothing but drama since dad left. Mom side, the medical bills are already crushing us, and you know she'll just try again. My heart stopped. Try again, Ashley kept going. Plus, now that everyone knows about her situation, it's embarrassing. People at church keep asking questions. The situation? That's what they called my depression after I came out as gay at 17. Three years of conversion therapy, family meeting, and constant prayer circles trying to fix me. Then came the real knife. If she does it again and succeeds, Ashley whispered, the life insurance has a two year suicide clause. Ask that now. Mom actually considered this? Ashley, don't even think that. But she didn't sound horrified. She sounded interested. I'm just saying, Mom, Jacob needs college money, and with her gone, we could finally move past all this shame she's brought on us. Jacob was Ashley's perfect golden child. Star athlete, straight A's, everything. I apparently wasn't. The next day, they brought Jacob himself. He was only 15, but Ashley had clearly been working on him. Why can't Aunt Sarah just be normal? He asked. My Friend's parents won't let me hang out with them anymore because of what she did. Mom patted his shoulder. Some people are just broken, honey. And broken things sometimes can't be fixed. I wanted to scream. Instead, I. They're listening to my own family discuss my suicide attempt like it was a public relations problem. The final blow came when my dad showed up. The man who left us when I came out, who hadn't spoken to me in two years. I heard about Sarah. He told mom. Maybe this is God's way of telling us she wasn't meant for this world. That's when I opened my eyes. All three of them jumped back like they'd seen a ghost. Actually, I said, hang up slowly. God told me something different. He told me, you're all going to hell. The look of pure terror on their faces was worth every second of pain. I discharged myself that afternoon and haven't spoken to any of them since. Turns out the best revenge is living well.

They assigned me decorations. I figured I'd buy some balloons and disappear before the actual party. But then they shared details about Sarah's favorite sunflowers, her rough year after divorce. These people clearly loved her, and I got invested in making her day special. The party was across town. I showed up with sunflower decorations, feeling like a fraud. When I knocked, a woman said, you must be the decorator. Sarah is going to love these. I just nodded and started setting up. Everyone thanked me for helping, even though they'd never met me. When Sarah arrived, she burst into tears. Seeing all her friends, she hugged everyone, including me. Thank you so much for coming, she says. I don't think we've met. Before I could answer, someone shouts, that's the decorator from the group chat! Sarah hugged me again. You're an angel for helping plan this. I spent the whole party pretending I belonged. Sarah kept introducing me as the sweet decorator who made everything beautiful. Learned she just started a new job and was feeling isolated. Seeing her surrounded by people who cared made her cry happy tears. At the end, Sarah asked what she owed me. I said it was free Just happy to help. She insisted on paying anyway and asked for my card. I never told anyone the truth. Sarah has been texting me party ideas since. And honestly, I might just start a decorating business.

When they realized I was wearing the same foundation shade. So I'm getting ready for Emma's birthday party. I grabbed my new Fenty Foundation that I've been saving for a special occasion. The shade was called Honey Creme, and it matched my skin perfectly. I spent like, an hour blending it, making sure everything looked flawless. This foundation cost me two weeks of babysitting money, but I figured it was worth it for such a big party. When I walked into Emma's house, everything seemed normal at first. The usual crowd was there, music was playing, and people were taking those typical mirror selfies by the kitchen. But then something weird started happening. One by one, I noticed girls going to the bathroom and coming back looking really upset. First it was Katie, then Megan, then even Emma herself. I couldn't figure out what was going on until I overheard Ashley whispering to her friend by the snack table. She kept glancing at me and saying something about foundation shades. That's when it hit me. I pulled out my phone and turned on the front camera to check my makeup. Everything looked fine to me. But then I noticed something strange. Under the party lighting, my foundation looked completely different than it did in my bedroom mirror. Instead of the warm honey color I thought I was wearing, it looked almost gray and ashy. But that still didn't explain why everyone Was acting so weird around me. Then Brianna walked up to me with this really concerned look on her face. He pulled me aside and whispered that maybe I should go touch up my makeup in the bathroom. I was confused, but followed her anyway. When we got to the bathroom, she closed the door and locked it. That's when she told me the truth. That made my stomach drop. Apparently, there had been this whole group chat going around school for weeks. Some of the popular girls had been making fun of different people's appearances, including mine. They had specifically been mocking my skin tone and saying I probably couldn't afford good makeup. One girl, Jessica, had even bet that I would show up to the party wearing cheap foundation that didn't match. But here's where it gets really messed up. Jessica had somehow found out exactly what shade of foundation I bought. She'd seen me at Sephora the week before and watched me get colour matched. So she went and bought the exact same shade, even though it looked terrible on her pale skin. Her plan was to show up wearing it as some kind of joke, like she was making fun of me. The problem was, when Jessica arrived at the party wearing the same foundation shade, it became obvious to everyone what she had been planning. The foundation looked absolutely horrible on her because it was way too dark, and everyone could tell she was trying To mock someone when they saw me walk in wearing the same shade, but looking natural and beautiful, they all

What happened? I was driving cross country for grad school when I stopped at this sketchy truck stop in Oklahoma. The bathroom was disgusting, but I really had to go. While sitting there, I noticed someone had carved if found, call this number into the stall door with a phone number underneath. I thought it was weird. Like what did they mean if found? Is it a joke, some kind of scavenger hunt? I took a picture of it with my phone, mostly because it seemed random and funny. Two days later, I'm bored in my new apartment with terrible Wi-Fi and no cable yet. I'm scrolling through my photos and see the bathroom number again. Some stupid reason I decide to call it. What's the worst that could happen, right? A woman answers on the third ring. Hello. She sounds tired, maybe middle aged. I feel like an idiot immediately. Um, hey, this is going to sound really weird, but I found your number written in a bathroom stall in Oklahoma. It said, if found, call this number. So I thought I'd call and see what's up. Dead silence, like complete silence for maybe 10 seconds. What town? She asks. And her voice is different now. Shaky. Somewhere outside Tulsa, Little Truck stop off I forty. More silence. Then she starts crying. Not like sad crying, but shocked crying. That's my sister's phone number, she whispers. She has Been missing for three years. My stomach drops. This went from funny to horrible real fast. She explains that her sister, Jessica, was 22 when she disappeared. She'd been driving from Texas to Kansas for a job interview. Her phone last pinged at that exact truck stop before going dead. Police searched everywhere but found nothing. I tell her I'm driving back that way tomorrow and I'll check the bathroom again. She gives me her name, Linda, and begs me to look for anything, any clue about what happened to Jessica. The next morning, I drive three hours back to that truck stop. The bathroom is just as gross as before. I examine every inch of that stall. Behind the toilet paper dispenser, there's a tiny gap where the metal meets the wall. I stick my finger in and feel something. It's a folded photo, all yellow and wet from three years of bathroom humidity. When I unfold it, I see a young woman with brown hair smiling at the camera. On the back in smeared ink, someone wrote, tell my sister I'm sorry. I tried. I take pictures and call Linda immediately. When I describe the photo, she starts sobbing. It's Jessica, she wrote that, Linda says between sobs. I know her handwriting. I drive straight to the police station. They reopen Jessica's case with this new evidence. Turns out there were other missing persons reports from truckers who'd used that route around the same time. It took 8 Months. But they found remains in woods about 5 miles from the truck stop. DNA confirmed it was Jessica. The case is still open, but at least Linda knows what happened to her sister. Linda told me Jessica had written the number hoping someone would find it and call if something happened to her, like a backup plan. Smart girl. Just wish it could have saved her instead of just giving us closure. Another full story on channel link below.

I worked nights at Tony's Pizza during college to pay my rent. When the phone rang at 11:30 on a Tuesday, I wasn't expecting anything crazy. This guy calls in and orders 12 large pizzas, all different toppings, pepperoni supreme, Hawaiian meat lovers, veggie white sauce, barbecue chicken, the whole menu basically. I'm writing it all down thinking this has to be for some late night office party or something. Then he says, I need these ready in 20 minutes. I pause for a second. Sir, with 12 large pizzas and all different toppings, we're looking at about 40 minutes minimum. Our ovens can only fit so many at once. Cuts me off immediately. You're just being lazy. I've ordered from here before and you guys are always slow. Just get it done or I'll call your boss. My heart sinks because I really need this job. Rents due in three days and I'm already behind. So I tell him we'll try our best and hang up. I run back to the kitchen and explain the situation to Carlos, our cook. He looks at me like I'm crazy but starts pulling out dough. We're both working like maniacs, stretching dough, adding sauce, throwing toppings everywhere. The manager even jumps in to help. We're sweating, covered in flour, moving faster than I've ever seen this place move. We actually managed to get all 12 pizzas done in 25 minutes. I'm genuinely proud. Of what we pulled off. I call the guy back, slightly out of breath. Hey, your 12 pizzas are ready for pickup. That'll be 247 to 80. There's this pause and he starts laughing. Not like a chuckle, but this loud, obnoxious laugh. Oh, man, I changed my mind. Cancel the order. My stomach drops. Sir, I'm sorry, but we don't accept cancellations on large custom orders. The pizzas are already made. He's still laughing. Maybe next time don't be so slow. Learn to manage your time better. And he hangs up. I just stand there holding the phone, staring at 12 perfect pizzas that nobody wants. Carlos is looking at me, waiting for an explanation. The manager comes out and I have to tell him what happened. We'll have to toss them, he says, shaking his head. Can't resell custom orders. That night, I watched $247 worth of food go straight into the dumpster. I was furious. But instead of exploding, I got smart. Our system keeps caller information for delivery tracking. I pulled up his number and found his address. Then I did some digging online. Social media made it easy. Found out where he worked, what he drove, even his full name. A week later, same number calls in different voice this time, but I recognized the number immediately. Don't take that order, I tell my manager. That's the guy who scammed us last week. But I wasn't done. I had his number memorized by now. I Started calling other.

Well, have some more. So I'm 17 living in Jersey and we just got dumped on with like two feet of snow. Schools canceled, roads are trash. And I'm thinking this is perfect timing to make some quick cash. I grab my shovel and start hitting up houses in my neighborhood. First few houses go great. Made about 80 bucks in like three hours just clearing driveways and walkways. Pretty solid money for someone who usually makes minimum wage scooping ice cream at the mall. Then I get to this house on Maple Street, big two story place with a massive driveway that curves around to a three car garage. This lady comes out wearing this fancy purple coat and matching boots. She's probably in her 50s with this weird fake smile. She goes, oh, honey, you're exactly what I need. I'll give you $50 to clear my whole driveway and the sidewalk too. It's a lot of work, but you look strong. Fifty bucks for one house? Hell yeah. I tell her it's a deal and get to work. This driveway was no joke. Took me like 20 minutes of non stop shoveling. My back's killing me. My hands are frozen even with gloves and I'm sweating under my coat. But I'm thinking about that 50 bucks the whole time. Finally finish and walk up to the front door, ring the doorbell twice. Nothing. I can see lights on inside. So I know someone's home. I wait like two minutes and ring again. Still nothing. I walk around to the back door and knock pretty loud. I can hear a TV on inside, but nobody comes. Then I see movement in the kitchen window and catch this lady literally peeking at me through the blinds. Second she sees me looking, she ducks away real quick like she's playing hide and seek. That's when it hits me. This lady just scammed me out of 20 minutes of hard work and 50 bucks. She never planned on paying me at all. I'm standing there in the cold feeling like a complete idiot. Start walking home all pissed off, kicking chunks of ice and muttering about how people suck. But then I remember my buddy Tyler, who lives three houses down, has this snow blower his dad bought last winter. Tyler's cool about it. When I explain what happened, he goes, dude, that's messed up. Yeah, take it. Just bring it back when you're done. This thing's a beast, like one of those big orange ones that can clear a whole driveway in five minutes. I wheel it down to the ladies house and fire it up. The revenge part was beautiful. Aimed that snow blower right at her perfect little driveway and started blasting every single flake. I just shoveled right back where it came from. But I didn't stop there. I grabbed snow from her neighbor's yards, too, piled it up, even Higher than before. Made sure to pack it real tight so it'd be extra hard to shovel, even through some ice chunks on top for good measure. About halfway through my snow dump, the front door flies open and this lady comes charging out in her slippers, no coat, screaming her head off. What do you think you're doing? You can't do this. I'm calling the police. I just kept blowing snow onto her driveway while yelling back, you said you'd pay me 50 bucks. Where's my money? I never said that. You're vandalizing my property. Funny how your memory works when you don't want to pay someone. She's standing there in the snow in her pajamas, turning red in the face. But I just finished up, turned off the machine and wheeled it back to Tyler's house. Heard through the neighborhood Grapevine that she ended up having to pay some company like 150 bucks to clear her driveway the next day because it was packed so tight. Apparently, she tried calling the cops, but they told her it was a civil matter since I was just moving snow around on public property.

I've been driving trucks for 12 years now, and I've seen people, men especially, at their darkest late at night on the road. I started driving trucks after my daughter was born because it paid better than warehouse work. My route takes me from Dallas up through Arkansas and into Tennessee. There's this one gas station that I try to avoid like the plague. It's one of those places where the parking lot lights are half broken and there's always sketchy stuff going down. Some nightmare on Elm Street shy. Last time I was there, some tweaker tried to sell me a chainsaw at 3 in the morning. But sometimes you need gas and it's the only stop for 40 miles. This happened about six months ago. I pulled in around 11 at night and noticed something was different right away. The old guy who usually work nights wasn't behind the counter. Instead, there was this young girl who couldn't have been older than 19. She had bright purple hair and enough piercings to make her head explode in an MRI. Full sleeve tattoos on both arms, too. She was reading a textbook when I walked in, so I figured she was a student. I grabbed an energy drink and some beef jerky and Went up to pay. You new here? I asked while she rang me up. Yeah, started last week, she said without looking up from scanning. They had a help wanted sign in the hours work with my class schedule. Well, my stomach dropped a little. This girl had no idea what she'd signed up for, so I told her very respectfully, listen, I don't mean to pry, but you might want to find somewhere else to work. This place gets rough, especially at night. She finally looked up at me, and her face went hard. I can take care of myself, thanks. That annoyed me a little, but I needed her to understand. I'm sure you can, but the drivers that come through here aren't your average cost. Some of these guys have been on the road for days straight. They get weird ideas in their heads, especially when they see a young woman working alone. Is that supposed to be a threat? Her voice got sharp. No, I'm trying to warn you. I've been stopping here for years, and I've seen some bad stuff go down. You need to at least keep some heat under the counter for Protection. Get out. She pointed at the door. I don't need some random trucker man explaining danger to me that I can handle myself. I don't even know what mansplaining is. I said, look, I have a daughter about your age, and I'd want someone to tell her before I could Even say anything else, she screamed out. Before I call the cops and report you for harassment. I held up my hands and backed away. Fine. I tried. Some people just won't listen when you're trying to help them. I paid for my stuff and left without another word. Back in my truck, I popped open the energy drink and did my usual safety check. Tires looked good, load was cure. I was just about to pull out when I remembered I'd promised my wife I'd grab diapers on the way home. My wife just had another baby girl. She goes through them like crazy and we were almost out. I sat there for a minute debating whether to go back in. The girl clearly didn't want me there, but I really needed those diapers. I waited about five minutes to let things cool down, then headed back inside. The store was empty. That purple haired girl behind the counter. I hoped for the best and told myself maybe she was in the bathroom or on break. Then I heard.

I stayed up all night sewing. My daughter Emma had been practicing her dance routine for months. She was playing a Woodland fairy and I wanted her costume to be perfect. I spent weeks hunting down the right fabric, this shimmery green tool that looked like actual magic when it caught the light. I even drove to three different craft stores to find these tiny silver bells that would jingle when she moved. The night before the recital, I was still at my kitchen table at 2:00am, hand sewing each individual sequin onto the bodice. My fingers were bleeding from needle pricks and my back was killing me from hunching over the tiny details. But seeing Emma's face light up when she tried it on made every minute worth it. She spun around our living room like she was actually floating. The recital day arrives and I'm in the auditorium with my phone ready to record everything. Emma looks absolutely stunning backstage in her costume. All the other parents are complimenting how beautiful it is. That's when this mom, Jennifer, walks up to me with this huge smile. She starts going on about how talented I am, asking where I Learned to sew like that, saying she could never make something so intricate. I'm feeling pretty proud, thanking her, explaining how I taught myself from YouTube videos and practiced on old sheets first. And the kids come out for Their group number and I'm filming Emma dancing like the little star she is. After the performance, I'm standing near the refreshment table when I overhear Jennifer talking to a group of other moms. She's telling them how she stayed up all night making that gorgeous fairy costume, how she's always been crafty, how sewing relaxes her. She's describing every single detail. I spent hours perfecting the hand sewn sequence, the layered tool, even the silver bells I drove across town to find. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I walked over and said, excuse me, but that's actually my daughter's costume that I made. Jennifer just laughed and said, oh, no, you must be mistaken. That's definitely Emma's costume that I worked so hard on. The other moms are looking back and forth between us, clearly confused. One of them asks Jennifer to show them the dress up close. She confidently walks over to where the kids are changing out of their costumes. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed everyone the step by step photos I'd taken while making it. Pictures of me cutting the pattern, sewing the bodice, attaching each layer of tool. There's even a selfie of me at 2:00am with the finished costume looking exhausted but happy. Jennifer's face went completely red. She started stammering about how she helped with some of the details, how she gave me advice on the design. But I, I had photos proving I'd done every single Piece myself. The other mom started asking Jennifer why she would lie about something like that. She grabbed her daughter and rushed out of there so fast she left her purse behind. But here's the best part. One of the moms in that group turned out to be a coordinator for the local theater company. She was so impressed with my work that she asked if I'd be interested in designing costumes for their upcoming production. That lie Jennifer told actually got me my dream job. Now I'm the head costume designer for three different theater groups in town.

When I was 15, my older brother Eric left home after this huge screaming match with our dad. Dad had always been super strict about everything, grades, curfew, chores, you name it. But Eric was 18 and wanted to do his own thing. You know, they got into it over something stupid like Eric staying out past midnight on a weekend. I remember standing at the top of the stairs listening to them yell. Dad was going off about respect and responsibility and Eric was shouting back about how nothing he ever did was good enough. Then dad said the words that still give me chills. If you walk out that door, don't bother coming back. Eric grabbed his backpack, stuffed some clothes in it and slammed the front door so hard the whole house shook. Mom tried calling him that night, but his phone went straight to voicemail. She left like 20 messages. Dad just sat in his recliner watching TV, acting like nothing happened. But I could tell he was waiting for Eric to come crawling back. We all were. Days turned into weeks. Mom would set an extra plate at dinner out of habit, then quietly put it away. She'd leave Eric's bedroom door open and sometimes I'd catch her just standing there staring at his unmade bed. Dad never talked about it, but he started checking his phone constantly, probably hoping for a text or Something I kept thinking Eric would show up for my birthday in October or maybe Thanksgiving when Christmas came and went with no word. I figured he was just being stubborn. Maybe he got a job somewhere. Maybe he had a girlfriend. Maybe he was living his best life and just didn't want to deal with family drama. Mom would cry sometimes when she thought nobody was looking. She'd sit at the kitchen table late at night staring at her phone, waiting for a call that never came. Dad would find her there in the morning and they'd have these weird, quiet conversations that stopped when I walked in. Years went by. I graduated high school, started college. Sometimes I'd wonder if Eric even knew I existed anymore. I used to imagine running into him at a gas station or something and he'd be all successful and happy and we'd laugh about how stupid that fight was. I pictured him having kids someday that I'd never meet. The hardest part was how dad changed. He got softer with me, like he was scared I'd leave, too. He'd ask about my friends, my classes, even offered to help with homework. He didn't understand. It was nice but also weird. As I could tell, he was thinking about Eric the whole time. Then I turned 21 and everything fell apart. I was at my apartment when this cop showed up at my door with an envelope, said they'd been trying to reach My parents but couldn't get through. The letter was from the state police and it had Eric's name on it. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely read it.

I was sitting in my cubicle on the third floor of this boring office building downtown, staring at spread sheets and thinking about what to make for dinner. Around 2:30, I noticed my phone lighting up with calls. Three missed calls from Jackson Elementary. I figured my son Tommy forgot his lunch money again. Or maybe got in trouble for talking too much in class. The kid never stopped talking at home, either. I stepped into the hallway to call them back. Secretary's voice sounded weird, shaky. She said there was an incident near the school and all parents needed to come to the community center on Oak Street immediately. When I asked what kind of incident, she just repeated the address and hung up. My hands started sweating. I grabbed my purse and told my supervisor I had a family emergency. The whole drive there, I kept thinking about how Tommy always forgot to look both ways before crossing streets. Maybe he got hit by a car walking to the corner store for chips. The community center parking lot was chaos. Police cars everywhere, ambulances, news vans. Parents were running around screaming their kids names. I saw Missus Garcia from Tommy's class crying into her phone. Inside, they had tables set up with volunteers checking names off lists. I got in line behind this dad who was shaking so bad he could barely hold his ID. The volunteer at my table, Was this young guy, maybe college age. And he looks like he wanted to throw up. I gave him Tommy's full name. Thomas Mitchell. Fourth grade, Mrs. Peterson's class. He flipped through papers, then called over an older woman. She had that look people get when they're about to tell you something terrible. She asked me to follow her to a smaller room. There were folding chairs in a circle and a box of tissues on every surface. That's when I knew. She sat me down and explained that there. There was a shooting at the park next to Tommy's school. The fourth grade classes were outside for recess when it happened. Some guy with mental problems started firing randomly at people walking by. Tommy had been playing on the monkey bars when it started. The other kids ran toward the school building, but Tommy must have gotten confused and ran the wrong way, toward the fence, toward the shooter. The woman kept talking, but I stopped hearing words. Something about how brave the teachers were, how they tried to protect everyone, how the police got there fast. But all I could think about was Tommy on those monkey bars. Probably showing off for his friends like he always did. I asked to see him. He said that wasn't possible right now, but they would arrange something later. She handed me a plastic bag with his backpack. The same Pokemon backpack he begged me to buy at the start of The school year, the worst part wasn't even that moment. It was driving home and seeing his bike in the driveway. His cereal bowl still in the sink from breakfast, his homework spread out on the kid.

One day, my kids came up to me and told me they didn't want to go over to Mommy's house anymore. I had split custody with my ex, but this was the first time when they outright refused to visit her for the weekend. I knelt down to their level and asked them what was up. Did Mommy say something to you? Then they told me how Mommy's new boyfriend would make them do weird things and also made them promise not to tell anyone. When I asked what these things were, my heart was shattered into a million pieces. Would make both my kids stand in front of a camera and strip to their undies. Then he would take a few pictures, give them both some candy, and go back to his room. At first, my kids were happy to get free candy, but they eventually realized that something was wrong and became uncomfortable, so they asked him to stop. And my wife's boyfriend landed an open handed slap on my daughter's face. They went to their mommy to complain and told her the absolute truth while crying. But instead of helping them, she told them to stop being jealous of her new relationship. She was under the impression that I had told our kids to spin this story and simply refused to believe them. I was so angry, but also distraught at the same time. The First thing I did was call the cops. But the person who showed up was my wife's brother in law, who was also a deputy. He told me the same thing that my wife said to our kids. Stop being jealous and stop telling disgusting lies about other people just because you can't handle their happiness. I don't know what kind of mother my ex wife was being that she didn't even consider the possibility of her boyfriend actually doing this. But I knew one thing, which was I couldn't just stay still. I sent my kids to my parents house before taking action. I was a regular at this local bar where I had made friends with these two ex convicts. Both of them agreed to go along with my plan. We waited for my wife to leave for work and snuck into her house to find the boyfriend. I knew he was unemployed, so he was probably in his room all day. He looked terrified when he saw me entering the house and tried to scream, but we stuck a cloth muffler into his mouth. You see, I was under the impression that he was using those photos he took to get himself off like a sicko. So my plan was to simply find the photos, delete them forever, and threaten him enough so that he never does it again. But then the boyfriend confessed as to what he was actually doing. Turns out he had a very Long line of other sickos who wanted to buy these photographs and were paying him top dollar for them. He had about six copies of each photo ready to be shipped out in a couple days time. The severity of the situation dawned on me, and I realized that if my kids didn't have enough courage to come to me, then I never could have stopped these photos from going out there.

My high school was trying to stop us from doing our senior prank simply because our new principal just felt like it. He said he'd stop our whole class from graduating and would hold us all back by a year if even one single person tried to pull a prank. Everyone was up in arms about it. But then about two weeks until the week of the prank, somebody had an idea and anti prank. This idea was instantly accepted, and it had floated around the halls until everyone was on board for an entire week. Every senior was going to bring in a potentially threatening item for a senior prank, but do absolutely nothing with it. The week of the prank started, and on that Monday, every single one of the 700 seniors in our year hand carried a watermelon with them to every class. There were hundreds and hundreds of watermelons being carried through the halls, with some kid even having a wheelbarrow full of them, and principal was absolutely freaking out. By noon, an announcement was made that all watermelons needed to be eaten or thrown away or they would be confiscated. By that afternoon, every watermelon was taken away. The next day, we brought in a bowl or a plate, and the same exact thing happened. We did this every day with a new item until the grand finale. The day Of the prank, I'll never forget it. We all brought in a gallon jug of water as usual. There was an announcement by the principal that they would take away the water from people. Lunchtime came, and teachers started going around, and by the end of lunch, every jug of water had been confiscated. And this. This is exactly what we had all been waiting for. We wasted no time and started taking to social media. Thousands of tweets were sent to new stations, and every single one of these tweets was about how our principal was taking away water from the students. We tweeted that we weren't allowed to drink water and were severely dehydrating. We're begging news stations to help us get our water back. The fact it was 94 degrees outside only helped us. And before the end of the day, four different news reporters were at our school. Our principal was beside himself. I'm pretty sure I saw him running to the staff bathroom to throw up as he saw the reporters at the doors. He wanted to stay indoors, but he was advised by the assistant principal that not responding would only make things worse. So he stepped outside and was instantly swarmed with questions about why he would torment his students. He tried his best to explain what we had been doing the whole week, but was severely unsuccessful. I'm guessing the stress of everything caused his brain to malfunction, because in between answering Questions. He whipped out a bottle of water and took a sip. A picture of him doing so was captured, and the very next day he was on the front page of the local newspaper.

Standing in the back row of the funeral home with kernel whiskers tucked inside my jacket probably wasn't my best decision. But Grandpa's last text to me before he died was, bring the ferret to my funeral no matter what anyone says. And I wasn't about to let him down now. My mother spotted the ferret's tiny head poking out during the opening prayer and her face turned purple like she was choking on her own rage. She marched straight through the crowd of mourners to get to me, catching many stray glances on the way by. And when she reached me, she grabbed my arm so hard I thought she might rip it off. None of this would have happened if I hadn't bought Colonel Whiskers three years ago from an exotic, a pet store that was going out of business. It was an impulse decision and I did it mostly because my apartment felt empty and I wanted something weird enough to be a conversation starter at parties. Grandpa would come over for Sunday dinner and I'd catch him sneaking Colonel Whiskers pieces of chicken under the table when he thought nobody was looking. But he always acted gruff about it, saying ferrets are just elongated rats with better PR. He mentioned once that the ferret's eyes reminded him of something from his army days, but he never finished the thought. I taught Colonel Whiskers a few basic trick. It's Like standing on his hind legs because I saw it on YouTube. But Grandpa just rolled his eyes and said, you're wasting your time on that weasel. The weird part was how Grandpa started showing up at random times during the week claiming he left his reading glasses or needed to borrow sugar. But he'd always end up sitting near Colonel Whiskers cage just staring at him for 20 minutes before leaving. Two weeks before he died, he sent me that text about bringing the ferret. And when I asked why, he just respond, did you'll see? Love you, which should have been a red flag because Grandpa never texted anyone about anything unless it was to complain about his cable Bill. So here stood my mother shrieking that I was bringing diseased animals into a sacred space and deliberately mocking Grandpa's distinguished military service with my pathetic attempt at getting attention. Everything always has to be about you, doesn't it? She spat, while telling everyone that I'd always been jealous of the relationship she had with her father and that this was my sick way of making his funeral about me. Colonel Whiskers just sat there in my jacket blinking at everyone with his beady little eyes, confused about why everyone was yelling. My mother grabbed the funeral director by his sleeve when he tried to intervene and yelled louder saying the ferret was probably rabid and definitely illegal. And she knew for a fact that Grandpa was terrified. Of small animals ever since Vietnam, which was complete fiction. But she was too deep in the back down. My brother tried to intervene, but she wheeled on him screaming, she probably trained that thing to urinate on the casket, which was insane even for her. But she kept going, saying I was the kind of person who would steal jewelry from mourners and she had 17 years of evidence to prove it. She announced to the entire room that Grandpa specifically told her before he died, I never want to see that disgusting creature again and that if I had any respect for his memory, I would leave immediately before she called both the police and animal control. The room erupted into chaos with relatives shouting over each other about whether ferrets belonged at funeral, while my mother kept yelling that I was an emotional vampire who fed on family misery and that's why I brought a rodent to their father's funeral. I kept trying to explain that ferrets aren't rodents, but nobody could hear me. Over all the screaming, the funeral director cleared his throat and announced it was time for Grandpa's requested video message, which nobody knew about. And the scream behind the casket flickered to life, showing Grandpa in full military dress uniform. He stared directly into the camera and said, if my daughter is making a scene about Colonel Whiskers right now, then everything is going according to plan. And my mother's face went white. Grandpa continued, what none of you know is that I've been secretly training that ferret for two years in advanced military drill procedures because I needed a mission and this seemed funny as hell. While my jaw dropped open, he barked, Colonel Whiskers, attention and the ferret.

Growing up, my sister Kayla made everything about her. My birthday parties, she got gifts, too, because I wouldn't exist without her. Every graduation, every achievement hijacked. When I won the science fair in 8th grade, she convinced my parents to throw her a supportive sister party the same night. When I got into college, she announced her engagement at my Celebration dinner. When I graduated with honors, she showed up in a revealing red dress and spent the whole ceremony flirting with professors. The pattern never stopped. Kayla had this way of making herself the victim. Whenever I achieved anything, you're so lucky, she'd say. I sacrificed so much for you. Growing up. Meanwhile, I was the one babysitting her kids while she partied through her 20s. I was the one lending her money she never paid back. I was the one covering for her when she bailed on family obligations. When I got engaged to my Indian fiance, Priya, I was terrified Kayla would find a way to ruin it. Sure enough, at our engagement party, she immediately joked about wearing white to our wedding. It'll be so funny, she laughed, like in the movies, I'll be the mysterious woman in white. She even made this dramatic pose, hand on her forehead like some soap opera actress. I pulled her aside and told her, absolutely not. This is my one day. Kayla, please. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic, that it was just a joke. God, you're so sensitive. It's not like anyone would actually confuse me for the bride. But she seemed to agree to drop it, too. Weeks later, I found out she'd gone behind my back and asked Priya directly, your sister seems really excited about her dress choice. Priya mentioned casually over dinner, she kept asking about fabric and styles. My blood ran cold. I knew exactly what that meant. I freaked out on Priya explaining Kayla's entire history of stealing my moments. She did this at my high school graduation, wore this attention grabbing red dress and flirted with all the dads. At my college graduation, she announced her pregnancy. She'll definitely show up in some elaborate white gown designed to make everyone look at her instead of us. That night, I had a complete breakdown, sobbing, hyperventilating. 28 years of suppressed resentment came pouring out. I was convinced Priya would see my toxic family dynamics and run for the hills. Who wants to marry into that kind of drama? Instead, she held me and said something genius. You know, white isn't the bridal color in Indian weddings, right? I froze. In all my panic about Kayla's manipulation tactics, I completely forgotten that crucial detail. Kayla had no idea Priya would be wearing a stunning red lehenga with intricate gold embroidery. Wedding day arrives. I'm getting ready with my groomsmen when my Cousin texts, dude, your sister just walked in looking like she thinks she's the bride. My stomach dropped until I remembered Priya's words. Then I actually started laughing. Kayla struts in wearing this elaborate white ball gown, strapless with a cathedral train, clearly custom made and expensive. She'd even hired a professional makeup artist, had her hair done in an elaborate updo with white flowers. The confused looks from Priya's family were absolutely priceless. Indian weddings are vibrant, colorful celebrations. And here's Kayla looking like she wandered in from a completely different century. During the ceremony, I kept glancing at Kayla. She looked increasingly uncomfortable as she realized everyone.

We need at least 200 K for the perfect day. Hey, she'd say, eyes lighting up. I thought she was just excited to marry me. Two weeks before our wedding, I decided to surprise her at work with coffee. The receptionist looked confused. Julia. She called in sick today. My stomach dropped. I drove to her apartment, found my father kissing her in the parking lot. I sat in my car, hand shaking, watching them laugh together. 20 years of no contact, and he shows up now. The timing was too perfect. I left without a word. That night, I checked her phone while she slept. Messages going back two years. She was his girlfriend before she even met me. They've been planning this whole thing. Marry me, divorce me, split my inheritance. The worst part? Reading how they mocked me. He actually thinks I'm a virgin. Poor kid has no idea what real women are like. Two more weeks and we're set for life. My father's replies were even worse. Always knew he was weak like his mother. Easy money from an easy target. I spent the next two weeks playing the perfect fiance. Smiled at dress fittings, nodded at seating charts, all while screenshotting every conversation, recording every call. The night before the wedding, Julia was practically glowing. Tomorrow's gonna be perfect, babe. She kissed my cheek the first time she touched me in months. Wedding day arrives. 150 guests packed in. Julia's family flew in from three states. Her dress cost $8,000. My money, obviously. She's walking down the aisle with that huge smile, probably calculating dollar signs. My father's in the third row, smirking like he's already won. The pastor begins, dearly beloved, we are gathered here today. Julia squeezing my hands, whispering, I love you so much. If anyone has a reason these two should not be wed, speak now or forever hold your peace. Dead silence. Julia is practically vibrating with excitement. I clear my throat. Stand up. I do. Julia's face goes white. Confused murmurs ripple through the crowd. I pull out my phone, connect to the ceremony screen behind us. Everyone should see What kind of woman I almost married. The first screenshot appears. Julia to my father. Can't wait to get his money and get out of this dump. Gasps echo through the chapel Julia's grabbing my arm! Stop, please! This isn't. Next message. Just a few more weeks. He's so stupid. He actually believes you love him. Her family's jaws are on the floor. My father's trying to sneak toward the exit. Here's my favorite. I announce, pulling up a voice recording. Julia's voice fills the speakers. The virgin act is killing me. But desperate boys pay better once we're married.

When I turned 15, my mom went from strict to straight up paranoid. One night after dinner, she plopped down next to me with this weird smile and said she was installing a family safety app on my phone. I watched her tap away, giving herself access to everything. My location, photos, texts, even my drafts on social media. It's just to keep you safe, honey, she said, handing my phone back like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. It felt like having a stalker who lived in my house. At first I tried to be cool about it. Maybe it would calm her down, right? Wrong. Things got insane fast. She text me in the middle of conversations asking who I was with. She'd comment on memes I hadn't even posted yet because she was reading my drafts. Worst part? She started replying to my friends pretending to be me. My buddy Jake texted asking if I wanted to hang out, and my mom replied, sure thing, buddy! With way too many exclamation points. Jake called me laughing, asking why I was texting like a soccer mom. I had no idea what he meant until I checked my messages. Then came the day that broke me. I was in history class when Mrs. Wilson pulled me aside. She look uncomfortable as hell. Liam, your mother called the school. She's concerned about some message you sent about Me. My stomach dropped. I knew exactly what she meant. I texted my best friend Kyle the night before, joking about how our history teacher's haircut looked like she stuck her finger in an electrical socket. It was just stupid friend stuff, not meant for anyone else. But my mom had read it and called the school to complain about my private joke. I wanted to disappear into the floor. By lunch, Kyle wasn't talking to me. Neither was Jake. Word got around that my mom was reading everything, and suddenly nobody wanted to text me anymore. Some kids even blocked me. It was like my social life had a disease, and the disease was my mom. That night, I stared at my phone, feeling trapped. But then I noticed something. The tracking app worked both ways. It logged every time someone accessed the account. I spent hours studying those logs, and what I found made my skin crawl. My mom wasn't just checking my phone during the day. She was logging in at 1:00am, 2:00am, even 3:00am. She was forwarding my messages to her laptop. She was screenshotting my photos. He was living inside my phone 24 7. So I came up with a plan. I created a fake friend named Daniel, made up this whole persona, gave him a backstory, even found some random photos online to use as his profile pic on a group chat with myself. Then I started a long conversation with Daniel about this Epic party happening at some remote barn outside town. I made it sound exclusive, secretive, like something a paranoid mom would totally freak out about. I mentioned the address, random dirt road I found on Google Maps that LED to absolutely nothing. I talked about how it was starting at midnight, how everyone was going to be there, how I couldn't wait to finally do something without my mom knowing. Then I put my phone down and waited. At 1:00am, the app logged that she opened the conversation. At 1:00am, I heard her bedroom Door Creek open. At 1:00am, I heard the garage door. 2:15 a m, my dad's phone rang. It was the police. They pulled over a woman in pajamas doing 85 miles per hour on a back road, claiming she was looking for her son at some party. She couldn't explain why she was driving around in the middle of nowhere at 2 a m. Dad had to drive out and pick her up. When they got home, I pretended to be asleep, but I heard everything through my bedroom wall. Linda, what the hell were you thinking? He's at some party. I saw the messages. What messages? He's been asleep for hours. The next morning, I came downstairs for breakfast like nothing happened. Mom looked exhausted, embarrassed. Dad looked pissed. Calmly pulled out my phone and opened the tracking app. Hey, dad, wanna see something interesting? I showed him the message logs. How mom had been reading Everything. For months, how she'd been waking up in the middle of the night to spy on me. How she'd driven to a fake party based on fake messages I'd created just to prove a point. Dad didn't say much. He just took Mom's phone, walked over to the kitchen counter, and factory reset it right there. The sound of it powering back up was the sweetest thing I'd ever heard. From now on, he said, looking at both of us, Liam keeps his phone and, Linda, you need help. Mom tried to argue, but dad shut it down. You drove into the middle of nowhere at 2 a m. Based on text messages? That's not normal. Three months later, mom started therapy. She still worries about me, but now she asks questions like a normal parent instead of reading my messages like the FBI.

So I've been friends with ULA for about four years now. She's this sweet girl who works at the coffee shop downtown. But there's this one thing about her that always comes up when she's dating. Her tattoo right below her collarbone in pretty cursive letters, it says Forever Brian's. He got it when she was like 22 after her fiance Brian, died from cancer. The whole thing happened super fast. They found out he was sick and three months later he was gone. I get it. That's devastating. But 15 years later, she's still single and keeps wondering why every guy she gets serious with eventually bails. I've watched her go through 4 different relationships since I've known her. There was this accountant named Greg who seemed really into her until he saw the tattoo during their third date. He literally asked her if she was planning to get it covered up. Then there was this teacher, Mark, who dated her for 6 months before he finally told her it made him feel like he was competing with a dead guy. Most recent one was this mechanic who straight up said he couldn't handle feeling like a placeholder. Last Thursday night, my wife Jessica was having ULA over for one of their girls nights. I was downstairs playing ball, doors gate when They both came down around 10:30, clearly having had a few drinks. ULA looked frustrated and Jessica was giving me this look like, help, help us out here. We need a guy's opinion, Jessica said, nudging me to pause my game. I warned them. I literally said, if you want my honest opinion, it's probably going to hurt your feelings. Are you sure? ULA nodded and sat down on the couch. I need to know why guys keep leaving me. Everyone says I'm great, but then things get serious and they disappear. So I asked them if they remembered Titanic. They both said, yes, obviously. Then I asked what the main story was about. I said it was a love story between Jack and rose. Okay, I said, but think about Rose's husband, the guy she actually married. He stayed with her for 60 years, raised kids with her, grew old with her. But when rose died, who did she go back to? Jack. After 60 years of marriage, her husband still wasn't her forever person. Ulla's face went white. That tattoo is basically telling every guy you date that they'll never be your number one, which is fine when you're just hooking up. But when things get serious, you're asking them to sign up to be Rose's husband. Nobody wants to be the second choice. Ulla started getting defensive. But Brian's dead. It's not like he's competition. That's exactly the problem. I said, they can't compete with a dead Person Brian will always be perfect in your memory. He'll never disappoint you, never leave dirty dishes in the sink, never snore or get fat or have a midlife crisis. Every guy you date knows they'll never measure up to that. Jessica was giving me warning looks, but ULA had asked for honesty. Look, I continued. Everyone wants to find their forever person, but you're walking around with a tattoo that says you already found yours. So guys, keep it casual until you want more. Then they protect themselves and leave. Nobody wants to be a placeholder. That's when ULA started crying, not just tearing up, full on sobbing. She kept saying I was wrong, that Brian wouldn't want her to be alone forever, that the tattoo was about honoring his memory. I'm not saying forget about Brian, I told her, but that tattoo is like wearing another man's wedding ring. It sends a message whether you mean it to or not. She ended up passing out on our couch that night, which honestly was a relief because the conversation was getting pretty intense. The next morning, she was quiet during coffee, but before she left, she said she was going to call some tattoo removal places to get consultations. I felt terrible. I told her to maybe talk to a therapist first. Removing it shouldn't be a decision she makes while hungover and emotional. But three days later, she texted me a photo of her chest with the tattoo. Completely lasered off, just red, irritated skin where the letters used to be. She said she'd been thinking about it for months and my honesty just gave her the push she needed. Two weeks after that, she matched with this guy on a dating app. They've been inseparable ever since. Last weekend at dinner, she thanked me for being the only person who told her the truth instead of just being polite.

But she started shaking when she realized what she had done. We were supposed to leave for Italy the next morning. My husband's whole family was going, parents, siblings, everyone. This was supposed to be our dream vacation to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. I was so excited since I've never been to Europe before. But my mother in law, Valerie, has always absolutely hated me. From day one, she's made it crystal clear that she thinks I'm not good enough for her precious son. She's made my life hell for the past three years with constant passive aggressive comments and deliberate exclusions from family events. The worst part, my husband just stands there and lets it happen. He never defends me, never calls her out. It's like he's terrified of Mommy dearest. For weeks leading up to this trip, Valerie had been making little comments, oh, I hope everyone's paperwork is in order. It would be such a shame if someone couldn't make it last minute. These international trips are so complicated. I started getting paranoid, but I thought I was just being crazy. Then my coworker at the print shop jokingly said, you should make a fake passport just in case she tries something. We both laughed, but honestly, something about Valerie's behaviour had me worried. So the day before we left, I actually did it. I used our high end printers. At work to create a convincing fake passport. Same photo, same info, but completely bogus. I figured if Valerie was planning something, at least I'd be prepared. That morning, I was in their kitchen finishing my packing when Valerie appeared. She had this weird gleam in her eyes that immediately put me on edge. You know what, Amanda? I'm done pretending to like you, she said. Suddenly, her voice dripping with venom. I've been waiting three years for the perfect moment to get rid of you. Before I could even process what was happening, she lunged for my passport sitting on the counter. I tried to grab it, but she was faster. Oops, looks like you can't come to Italy after all, she said. With the most evil smirk I've ever seen. She pulled out her kitchen lighter and set the passport on fire right there in the sink. I watched it burn completely to ash while she stood there looking absolutely triumphant. Guess you'll have to stay home while we have the time of our lives in Rome, she taunted. That's when I started laughing.

The first time I met my boyfriend Jared, I remember blushing from his deep voice and falling for the way he protected me when people yelled at me in video games. We were part of the same gaming discord during lockdown, playing till 3 in the morning every day. At first we just talked about new games and complained about terrible teammates, we started staying in voice chat after everyone else logged off. By the end of that first month, we were video calling every single day, talking about what it'd be like to go on an actual date together. Well, when we did find out, things got really complicated. I got a job offer in his city. When I told Jared, he immediately asked me when I'd be moving in. The excitement in his voice made me giggle. It's a sign, he kept saying. I agree. We started making plans about things we do once I moved in. We can move my table here and have matching gaming setups. We'll go to this awesome restaurant down the street and slow down. I laughed. Have all the time in the world to do everything now. Right before the big move, our discord server threw us a virtual party, even inviting both of our families to the video call to meet and celebrate it. Jared met me at the airport holding a giant bouquet of flowers. I ran straight Into his arms and closed my eyes, taking in the scent of his Cologne and warmth of his hug for the first time. I listened to his heart race just as fast through his chest. Wow, this is amazing, I whispered. The rest of the week was everything I'd ever imagine. We held hands while grocery shopping. We cook dinner together without a screen between us. We could kiss whenever we wanted. But by the third week, things started to get messy. Jared was a terrible morning person, waking up full of energy at 5 a m. Every day. He wanted us to go running in the mornings together before work, meet up in lunch, and fall asleep early. But me, I couldn't even form words before 10:00am, let alone go running online. I just sent a sleepy emoji and close my eyes while he went on his jogs. Now I woke up grumpy trying to match his schedule. Then there was his apartment. His gaming setup was always perfect on camera, but the rest of the place looks like a crime scene. Dirty dishes growing mold, clothes covering every surface, and he'd literally step over garbage instead of picking it up. One day while he was at work, I went full crime scene clean up on the apartment. I scrubbed and cleaned and threw out everything that resembled trash. I reorganized his clothes, his gaming setup, everything. When Jared got him, I expected a big thank you kiss, but Instead, he screamed at me, why'd you touch my stuff? Where are my controllers? My extra key fobs? Where's the food I was saving for tomorrow? I gagged. You mean the pizza that was starting to get moldy? Gross. What? I can just cut out the moldy parts. That was such a waste. And we'd argue and argue the rest of the day, calling each other names we'd never say online and end up sleeping with our backs turned to each other on the bed, both sides refusing to budge. But the worst part was realizing just how bad we were acting when we shared the same space. I desperately needed three hours of silence, of just doing whatever I wanted without judgment each day. But he took it personally, saying it made him feel like a bad boyfriend when I didn't want to constantly talk to him. One night, about a month in, I locked myself in the bathroom just to get some alone time. I sat on the toilet lid, scrolling through through our old messages. And it hit me. The boyfriend I wanted to be with wasn't him. That the online guy I loved was only a small portion, and the rest just wasn't it. So we had a talk. The calmest one we had all month. I think I was happier when you were pixels on my screen. I told him. He nodded. Yeah, me too. We both started laughing, then crying. We both wanted it. To work so badly. And somehow it felt bitter when it didn't. I kept the job, but got my own apartment across town. We tried going back to Facetime dates for a few weeks.

He abandoned me and our 2 month old son 8 years ago because he wasn't ready for fatherhood. I thought it would destroy me, but I figured it out alone. See, my ex wasn't just unprepared. He was cruel about leaving. Packed his things while I was at my postpartum check up, left a note saying he made a mistake. Jake moved in with his coworker Lena that same week, the woman he swore was just a friend. Within a month, they were posting couple photos. While I was selling my jewelry to buy formula, I worked nights at the hospital as a receptionist, $12 an hour, paid my elderly neighbor to watch the baby. Some weeks I chose between diapers and groceries. Food banks became my regular stops. Meanwhile, he was taking Lena on weekend trips hosted about finding true love. Never sent a penny for his son. Leon is 8 now, straight a student, soccer star, polite kid who helps neighbors carry groceries. He doesn't ask about his father anymore. Stopped asking at age 5. My ex showed up maybe four times a year, always canceled, last minute, sorry, something came up, work thing, Lena is not feeling well, car trouble. Leon would sit by the window waiting. I'd make excuses, emergency at daddy's work. Eventually Leon stopped waiting by the window. I went back to school. When Leon was 3, got my degree, got a real job, made real money and bought us a small house when he was 6. Last month, my ex got married to Lena. His mom sent me photos. She thought I should see how happy he looked. Lena's pregnant. Do any day starting his real family. His mom said, like, Leon doesn't exist. And two weeks ago, out of nowhere, my ex shows up at my door not to see Leon. Leon was at soccer practice. He came to ask for something. Lena had their baby three weeks ago and the delivery went badly. She needed an emergency C section. Now she has postpartum depression. She can't hold the baby without having panic attacks. She won't get out of bed. His mom lives in Florida but won't come help. Lena has no parents, so he wants me to watch their baby every weekday, 9 in the morning until 5 at night for three months, maybe longer if Lena doesn't get better. You managed fine with Leon, he says, standing at my door like he has any right to be there. You know how to handle babies. The audacity was breathtaking. This man who ran away from his own crying baby was asking me to raise his new daughter. I work. I told him, jobs have flexible schedules. You could work nights again or take family leave. Family leave to watch his child while his wife recovers from what I went through. Alone, I tried to close the door. He blocked it with his foot. Leon should meet his sister. Ophelia needs stability. You're already experienced, Philia. He named his daughter Ophelia, the name I'd wanted if we'd had a girl. He left his number and said to think about it. Then the text started. Daily, sometimes hourly, pictures of the baby, guilt trips. Lena's getting worse. The baby's not eating well. They're drowning. I'm the only one who can help. Family helps family. Don't punish Ophelia for our past. Be the bigger person. Then came uglier messages. I was bitter, vindictive, poisoning Leon against his sister. No wonder he left me. I was probably why Lena got depressed. Toxic energy, bad karma. Maybe I should look at why I'm alone. After a week of harassment, I. I had enough. I decided to drive to his house myself the next morning at 6 a. M. It was a three hour drive to my ex's suburban house, the house he bought with Lina. Four bedrooms, two car garage, pool, everything we planned before Leon was born. I sat in my car until I saw movement inside. Then I walked to the door and knocked my. My ex answered in boxers and a T-shirt, coffee mug in hand. His face went from annoyed to shocked when he saw me. Here's your answer, I said, handing him a printed invoice. Eight years of childcare, nights, weekends, sick days, total two.

You're no longer needed. They thought I'd cry after being fired mid trip. But 72 hours later, $1.5 billion vanished. I was somewhere over the Atlantic, halfway between South Palo and London when my phone buzzed. The subject line, termination notice effective immediately. No call, no meeting, just one sterile email from the same C E. O who two weeks earlier had looked me in the eye and said, you're the only one I trust to close this deal. I blinked at the screen in disbelief. Around me, the cabin was dark. Other executives snored in their business class pods. I sat frozen, staring at the words that had just erased nine years of my life. This wasn't just any deal. For 10 months, I had been piecing together what insiders called the Trident project. Three telecom giants across three continents moving their infrastructure onto our cloud. Value, $1.5 billion over seven years, Tokyo, London, SAO Paulo. I had carried it on my back and now I was no longer employed. At first, I felt nothing but silence. Not anger, not fear, just the hollowness of being erased. Midair, I reached under my seat and pulled out the matte black laptop no one at the company knew existed, the one I had encrypted myself. See, I'd Learned the hard way that loyalty isn't protect action. Months earlier, I'd overheard board members laughing about me. She dominates every room. She's not E V P material. She's a field op. Translation, too competent to ignore, too threatening to promote. So while they promoted the CEO's inexperienced daughter who once nearly leaked client data in Singapore, I quietly built something else, skeleton company, a backup plan, a parachute named Trayvant. Still, I kept delivering. I rewrote collapsing contracts, cleaned up their scandals, even let my work get published under other people's names. And now, somewhere over the ocean, they thought cutting my email would cut my influence. They were wrong. By the time I landed in London, my badge was dead, my desk wiped, my name stripped from the newsletter. But my clients, the ones I had spent sleepless nights convincing, hadn't signed with the company. They had signed with me. The first call came that night. Linda Clark, your com's general council. Why did your CEO's daughter send me your slides with her name on them? She asked flatly. I didn't answer. I didn't have to. She already knew. The next morning in Tokyo, Yuki Asano of telnova said quietly, we trust you, but not them. If you ever decide to lead instead of follow, call me. And in sound, Paul Louise Mata leaned across the table. After grilling me for four hours, I'll commit, but only if you're the one steering, not venture on. That's when it clicked. They hadn't fired me out of confidence. They had fired me out of fear. 72 hours after the email, while my former colleagues scrambled, To reach clients who no longer picked up, I opened Travont Secure Portal. Three logins blinked green. Tell Nova you, Eurocom, Brazil Link, all inside. I hit publish on a press release so simple it barely looked real. Travon Inc. Proudly announces a multi continent partnership with Telnova, Eurocom and Brazil Link. Value $1.5 billion. No fanfare, no vengeance speech. Just back in the glass tower I used to call home, the CEO's daughter probably clinked champagne glasses while headlines rolled in. Venture on loses Trident clients overnight me. I sat in a quiet hotel room with black coffee watching the sunrise. I wasn't broken. I wasn't erased. They thought firing me mid flight would end me. Instead, it freed me. And $1.5 billion later, the silence spoke louder than I ever could.

At the reading, the lawyer started laughing. My stepfather, Rick, had been married to my mom for only three years. When she died, he immediately started acting like he owned everything. Don't get too comfortable, he told me at Mom's funeral. You'll need to find your own place soon. I, I was 19 and halfway through college. Mom had been paying my tuition. Rick made it clear those days were over. Time to learn some responsibility, he said, packing up mom's jewelry. Two weeks later, we're sitting in the lawyer's office for the will reading. Brought his adult son, Kyle, for moral support. They were both grinning like they'd won the lottery. I want it on record, Rick announced before the lawyer even started, that I'm cutting Julia out completely. She's not my blood, and my wife would want her real family to inherit everything. The lawyer, Missus Patterson, looked confused. Mister Johnson, I don't think you understand how this works. Oh, I understand perfectly, Rick. Smirk. I'm the husband. Everything goes to me. Then I decide what happens to Julia. Kyle nodded along. Dad's been way too generous, letting her live in the house this long. That's when Missus Patterson started laughing. Gentlemen, I think you should sit down. Rick looked annoyed. Just read the will, lady. That's the thing, missus Patterson said, still chuckling. Your wife did write a will, but it's not what you think she pulled. Out a thick folder. Jennifer wrote this will two years ago after she was diagnosed with cancer. My heart stopped. Mom never told me she was sick. She left very specific instructions. Missus Patterson opened the will and started reading. I leave my house at 425 Oak street. To my daughter, Julia. Rick's face went white. I leave my savings account currently containing $847,000. My daughter, Julia. Kyle's mouth dropped open. I leave my life insurance policy, valued at $650,000. To my daughter, Julia. Rick stood up. This is impossible. I'm her husband. Yes, you are. Missus Patterson agreed. And Jennifer left you something, too. She flipped the page. To my husband, Rick, I leave my 2018 Honda Civic and my collection of coffee mugs. That's it. Rick screamed. Actually, there's more. Missus Patterson said. A letter. She handed me an envelope with my name on it. Inside was a handwritten note from mom. Julia, if you're reading this, I'm gone, and Rick is probably very angry right now. I need you to know that I was sick for eight months before I died. Rick knew about the cancer, but he convinced me not to tell you because it would interfere with your studies. My hand started shaking. He also suggested I shouldn't waste money on expensive treatments since the doctor said I only had a 30% chance of survival. He said we should save the money for our future together. That's when I realized Rick married me for my Money, not love. So I made sure the money went to the person who actually loved me. You, I. I looked up at Rick, who was reading over my shoulder. His face was bright red. She was dying anyway, he shouted. Why spend money on treatments that probably wouldn't work? Because she was my mother, I screamed back. Missus Patterson cleared her throat. There's one more thing. Jennifer also left instructions about the house. Julia, you have the right to evict any current residents immediately. Rick realized what that meant. You can't kick me out. I live there. Actually, I can, I said standing up. It's my house now. Pack your stuff. You have 30 days. Rick and Kyle stormed out, but not before Rick turned around. Your mother was a bitter, vindictive woman. No, I said, she. I was just smarter than you thought. Last week, I used some of Mom's money to pay for the cancer research fund at the hospital where she was treated. Rick is living in a studio apartment across town and working at a car dealership. Sometimes the best revenge is just letting people show you who they really are.

Our cafeteria had this weird echo problem in the back corner where the ceiling tiles were loose. If you whispered there during lunch, it would amplify and carry across the entire room like a ghost voice. I discovered this by accident when I was hiding back there, eating alone, complaining under my breath about Mr Rodriguez's impossible math test. Suddenly, half the cafeteria turned around looking confused. That's when the idea hit me. I started small, whispering random stuff during lunch to test the range. Someone left their car lights on or free pizza in the gym, just enough to watch heads turn and people look around confused. The acoustics were perfect. My voice would bounce off the loose tiles, get amplified by the weird ceiling cavity, then float across the room like some supernatural announcement. It sounded nothing like my normal voice, more like a distant radio transmission or a voice from another dimension. But then I overheard the drama that would change everything. Jessica Chen was bragging to her friends about how she'd been anonymously reporting kids to administration for vaping. I've gotten like 12 people suspended, he laughed. They have no idea it's me. I just sent anonymous tips to Principal Walsh's email. She was proud of it, genuinely proud of ruining people's lives for a few extra points on her college applications. Perfect. Target acquired. The next day during lunch, I positioned myself in the Echo corner. I Waited until Jessica was surrounded by her usual crowd, then whispered just loud enough. Jessica Chen is the vaping snitch, the whisper float.

So I'm dating Mitchell. He's 56, I'm 28. And yes, he's rich, like really rich. We met at the Starbucks where I was working on my laptop. He loved that I wasn't trying to get his attention and that I added to my coffee, in his words, more sugar than the Boston harbour needed in 1773. But here's what six months of dating him actually looks like. Waiters hand him the wine list. Never me. His friends, wives talk to me like I'm five, explaining what investment means really slowly. The valet gives Mitchell my car keys every single time. At his country club, someone always asks what I'm studying. I graduated four years ago. Last week, his lawyer asked if I needed help reading the dinner menu. It had seven items on it. Mitchell's company Christmas party is everything I expected and worse. I'm wearing this gorgeous Chanel dress that I bought myself because I liked it. And not even five minutes in, one of the wives pulls me into the bathroom. She puts her hand on my shoulder like she's about to deliver for terrible news and tells me I need to save the money Mitchell gives me for when this ends. When I mention having my own money, she laughs like I've told a joke and presses her friend's financial advisor card into my hand. He specializes in girls like me, apparently. Mitchell gets pulled into a work Emergency leaving me at the bar where his call kids don't bother lowering their voices. How much do you think Mitchell spends on her monthly? One says. Worth every penny at that age, another answers, cheaper than my boat maintenance. When I approach and mention my startup work, they find it hilarious. One actually asks if Mitchell taught me the word portfolio. Another suggests I'm confusing shopping with investing. Then the boss himself walks over with his champagne and says the most insulting thing yet. When you and Mitchell are done, you should date my son. He's more age appropriate and needs a pretty girl. I say, I don't need anyone to take care of me, but he just pats my head like I'm a golden retriever. We all know what you need, sweetheart. I'm about to tell him exactly what I needed in that moment when I hear Mitchell's voice from the conference room. The door is cracked open and he's on speaker phone negotiating to buy a tech company. The seller is refusing his 10 million offer, insisting it's worth more, but won't explain why. Mitchell sounds increasingly desperate, repeatedly asking what he's missing. That's when my blood runs cold. I know this company. I know it intimately. I know exactly what Mitchell is missing. I push into the conference room. Before I can stop myself, Mitchell looks up, irritated at the interruption. He tells the seller on the phone, sorry, my girlfriend just wandered in. I'm already scanning The papers across the table confirming what I suspected. The seller's voice crackles through the speaker asking what's going on. I state simply that the company has three major clients not listed in the disclosure. Mitchell freezes. This Eller's voice turns sharp, demanding to know how I could possibly know that. Mitchell starts apologizing for my intrusion while the C, E, O appears in the doorway. Mitchell, that's confidential information. You shouldn't be sharing these things. His wife laughs, suggesting I overheard something. And I'm trying to sound smart, but I continue.

The vent wasn't connected to any actual duct system. It was just a fake vent cover. And behind the black mesh screen was this tiny little camera lens. My stomach dropped to the floor. We tore apart my entire apartment and found three more hidden cameras. One was tucked behind a wall outlet in my bedroom. Another was inside the hallway light fixture. The worst one was drilled into the back of my bookshelf that I never moved because it was too heavy. We called the cops immediately. The cameras had wires that LED down to this creepy little storage unit in the basement. When the police opened it up, there was this whole surveillance setup. A small T V. Monitor, stacks of D V D's with dates written on them, and folders full of time stamps and notes about my daily routine. It was like some psycho's personal spy den. But here's the twist. Missus Caldwell didn't actually live in the unit above me. Her adult son, Kevin, did. And according to building management, he wasn't even supposed to be living there permanently. She told them he was just visiting occasionally to help with repairs. Kevin had his own key to my apartment. The maintenance guy confirmed that Kevin had done routine checks of my unit during my first week there while I was at work. That's when he installed all the cameras. Police arrested Kevin on the spot when they found him in the storage room. He Was just sitting there watching footage of me making breakfast from that morning. Missus Caldwell claimed she had no clue what her son was doing, but I wasn't buying it. She knew way too many details about my personal life. I moved out exactly one week later, and for months afterward, I checked every single vent and outlet in whatever place I stayed at. Even hotel rooms.

I've been living in my new apartment for four months when my upstairs neighbour, Missus Caldwell, made this weird comment at the mailbox. She was this lady in her 60s who always wore these bright scarves and smelled like peppermint. She seemed harmless enough. I love that green dress you wore Tuesday night, she said with this sweet smile. I froze. Yeah, I wore a green dress Tuesday night. But here's the thing. I never left my apartment. I was home alone watching Netflix on my couch. The dress wasn't even visible through my living room windows. Unless you literally pressed your face against the glass and stared in. At first I thought maybe she saw me through a crack in my curtains when I threw out trash earlier. But then the comments kept coming. I hope your spaghetti turned out better the second time. You looked so frustrated when it burned. You and your cat snore at the exact same time. It's actually pretty cute. You really should stop falling asleep with the TV on. That blue light's gonna wreck your skin. I started checking every single window in my place. My curtains were always closed. My blinds were tilted up so nobody could see in. I even covered my people with tape. So how the hell did this woman know everything I was doing that weekend? I called my cousin Ethan over. We set up our phones with motion Detection apps in every room. And I left for 30 minutes, came back and checked all the footage. Nothing weird. Then Ethan had this idea. What if it wasn't the windows? We started testing everything. Smoke detectors, electrical outlets, even the TV. Still nothing suspicious. But when Ethan opened the small bathroom vent to check if maybe sound was carrying through the vents, he noticed something really strange.

My brother texted, stay away from us. I replied, done. Then I withdrew my name as guarantor for their new house mortgage. I'm the family's designated adult, the one who gets late night calls for rides, the one who co signs things. My brother Robert is 29, charming, lives on impulse. His fiance, Bethany is intense, obsessed with social media. I never warmed to Bethany. She had this way of complimenting that felt like a slap. It's amazing that you're so stable and practical. Her smile never reached her eyes. Three months ago, they found their dream house in a neighborhood they couldn't afford. Their income wasn't enough for the mortgage. Robert asked me to be the guarantor, a massive 30 year financial risk. I had a lawyer draft a simple agreement with two key clauses. If they defaulted, I could take over their equity for what I paid and my guarantee was contingent on mutual respect and good faith. Any defamation would be grounds for immediate withdrawal. Robert barely glanced at. We're brothers. Good faith is a given. We signed it in front of a notary. At a family barbecue last weekend, Bethany came over, maybe tipsy, stood too close. You're always so serious. You should try to have some fun. It made me uncomfortable so I walked away. Two days later, my phone exploded with a text from Robert. Bethany had confessed I've been making her uncomfortable for Months. She claimed I cornered her, whispered she was too good for him, that she should be with a real man who could provide. The accusations were so specific, so venomous. This wasn't a misunderstanding. This was targeted character assassination. I tried calling Robert. No answer. Then the final message. I can't believe you do this to us. Bethany is a wreck. Just stay away from us. After 29 years together, my brother was gone. A strange calm settled over me. I texted back, done. My next call was to the mortgage advisor. Due to a significant personal conflict, I am formally withdrawing as guarantor. Sir, this will almost certainly lead to denial of their entire mortgage application. I am aware of the consequences. Three days later, frantic, banging on my door at ten PM Robert looked like he hadn't slept in days. What did you do? The loan is denied. You torpedoed the whole thing. You told me to stay away. I'm staying away from your finances, too. That was personal stuff. Bethany was upset. You don't ruin someone's future over a fight. A fight is arguing about who helps dad clean gutters. This, it was character assassination. And you believed her instantly? Without question. His phone buzzed. Bethany's voice, is he fixing it? Make him fix it. You have to call the bank, Robert demanded. Tell them it was a mistake. No, I'm not a light switch you can flick on and off. You don't get to treat Me like a monster in a bank. In the same week, the family pressure campaign started. Immediately, mom called. Families work through things. But Bethany launched a smear campaign, spinning stories about my growing jealousy and erratic behavior. Then a certified letter arrived from their lawyer demanding I reinstate.

When I asked what allowance, his face went white. For four months, I've been grinding three jobs, tutoring high school kids, weekend event staffing and bar shifts until 2:00am, classes until three PM, then straight to tutoring until six PM, quick dinner of instant noodles, then bar work until closing. I get home at 3:00am, study until 5, sleep for two hours, repeat, surviving on ramen packets and day old bread. When textbooks cost $400 each, I photocopy pages at the library. My friends go out Thursday nights while I'm serving drinks to businessmen who tip in singles. My bank account never goes above $200. Every dollar is calculated, $50 for groceries, $30 for laundry. I wear the same three shirts and my shoes have holes I cover with duct tape. Meanwhile, my sister Mariah floods Instagram from Paris. Designer coffee at trendy cafes, weekend trips to Monaco, new Dior dresses with captions like, mom always knows exactly what I need. Hashtag blessed, hashtag fashion life. When I begged mom for even $200 for groceries, she sighed heavily. Money is tight. Your father's practice is struggling. Paying your tuition is already stretching us. I worked harder, picked up extra shifts, skipped meals to save money. Last Friday, everything changed. I was carrying cocktails when the room started spinning. I remember reaching for the bar to steady myself, then nothing. I woke up in a hospital bed with an IV. The Doctor was stern. You collapsed from exhaustion and malnutrition. Your blood sugar was dangerously low. My bar manager visited, looking guilty, even working doubles every weekend. The rest of the month off. That meant losing $1,200 in income I desperately needed. My friend visited with groceries and made me spaghetti. While eating the first real meal I had in weeks, he said something that shattered my world. Your dad's a surgeon with a luxury car. You went to private school. How is your sister affording Paris? If money's so tight, you're working yourself into the hospital. That night, I called Mariah directly. Just checking in. How's Paris? Amazing. Mom just sent me the cutest Chanel bag for my birthday next month. My stomach dropped. How are you managing financially? Paris must be expensive. Oh, I don't worry about that. Mom transfers me about $3,000 a month plus extra whenever I need something special. $3,000 a month plus extras. While I was told there wasn't a single dollar to spare. At Sunday dinner, when dad asked about my allowance, I watched our family explode. What do you mean? Dad's voice was confused. I've been sending $2,000 every month since you started school. Mom kept cutting her pot roast, not looking up. Where is Henry's money? Dad asked mom. Silence stretched forever. I haven't sent any money to Henry. What? Why not? I've been keeping it for Mariah. She needs it more. She's studying fashion in Paris. It's expensive. She needs to Look the part. Dad's face turned white. You've been withholding Henry's allowance, letting him work himself into a hospital while secretly sending thousands to Mariah for shopping. Mariah has potential. She's special. She's delicate. Henry is exactly like you. He'll be fine. He doesn't need help. And Henry doesn't have potential. He's studying.

Then he called me, desperate when he found out I had already found someone better to accompany me. My sister Kira was always the golden child. I was the accident that came 11 months later. My mother kept my hospital bracelet in a drawer labeled oops until I could read it myself. At age six, favoritism was constant. Kira got new clothes every season, while I wore her hand me downs. Christmas, when I turned 8, I watched her unwrap the American Girl doll I begged Santa for. My gift was a dollar store knock off with the $1 99 cent sticker still on it. When I started crying, my father said, Selena, you're too old for tears. Kira is more sensitive than you. That was the moment I Learned I had to hide my emotions to avoid disappointing them further. Middle school was worse. At my eighth grade graduation, I won three academic awards while Kira sat in the audience getting seas. During the car ride home, instead of celebrating my achievements, my parents spent the entire time discussing how Kira must feel seeing me on stage so much. My mother said, Selena, maybe next time don't look so excited when they call your name. Think about your sister's feelings. In high school, I pulled straight A's while Kira barely passed. When report cards came home, they Pin hers to the fridge and put mine in a drawer. The day I got accepted to Northwestern with a full scholarship, I found my parents comforting Kira, who just been fired from her clothing store job for showing up late. My mother looked at my acceptance letter and said, Selena, this really isn't the time. Can't you see your sister is upset at. They spent an hour consoling her for losing a minimum wage job while completely ignoring my full scholarship that would save them $200,000. That night, my aunt Sandra told me something that changed everything. Selena, you were never an accident. Your parents did fertility treatments to give Kira a sibling, but when you turned out smarter than her, they didn't know how to handle it. Everything clicked into place. The constant comparisons, the downplaying of my achievements, the way they seemed annoyed when I succeeded. College became my escape. I met Matt there, someone who valued my intelligence instead of feeling threatened by it. For the first time, I experienced what it felt like to be someone's first choice. When he proposed during our senior year, I cried from relief as much as joy. Someone finally chose me first and meant it. Three weeks before my wedding, my father called. Lena. Kira scheduled her housewarming party for the same day as your wedding. Your mother and I think we should support her instead. You'll have Matt's family there. My heart shattered. Dad, she's known my wedding. Date for eight months. We'll try to stop by the reception if we can. When I told Matt's father, Jim, what happened, his eyes filled with tears. Selena, it would be the honor of my life to walk you down that aisle. His voice cracked with emotion. I've watched you for four years, and you're already the daughter I never had. Wedding day arrived. Jim was waiting at the church doors in his best navy suit.

Friend's mom was sort of weird. She was usually in her bedroom on her computer unless she was in the living room demanding us to paint her nails. Anyways, the rule was to eat before you got there because you wouldn't be fed while there. If you're there while they have dinner, you sit in the living room or my friend's bedroom and wait. Weirdly, this extended to breakfast than any other meal had while I was there, no matter how long I was there. Anyways, I figured out by age 8 that I could go three days max without eating before I passed out and got sent home. 2. I slept over a friend's house in grade school. One time he prepared us a bowl of cereal the next morning for breakfast, not thinking anything of my behavior. I didn't finish the milk. I just never used to. I don't know. He was like, are you are you going to finish that? Me? I don't think so. Him? Does that matter? He panicked. Absolutely panicked. he put it down the toilet before his parents came back into the room. I don't know what the rule was exactly, but based on his reaction, I still feel bad about it. I was like 8. And didn't think now that I'm older I realize his family probably didn't have much and he didn't want them to see anything being wasted 3 the family would just put all the plates on the floor for the dog to lick clean before putting them back in the cupboard 4 when I was around 8 I went to a friend's house for a playdate slash dinner after school when I asked for a drink her mom gave me a baby bottle with squash in it I laughed but she didn't laugh back my friend took her own bottle and started drinking I asked the mom if I could please have a cup instead but she told me no and that children drink from bottles in their house never went there again. 5 I I went to see a college friend over the summer stayed the night her parents weren't home when I got there and we went into the living room to talk there were 4 recliners no couch or other chairs she sat in one recliner I sat in another she asked what are you doing and informed me I was sitting in her dad's chair the remaining chairs belonged to her mom and brother where was I supposed to sit on the floor? 6 they yelled at me for not letting the cat that was walking around on the table eat from my plate I love cats but what in the world apparently gently nudging the cat Away from my food was interfering with the freedom of another sentient being. I was 12. I think I was pretty freaked out. Seven, when I was a kid, my friend's dad made his kids line up on the couch and just sit there silently while they watch TV and sip. If you were visiting, you had to do it too. When my mom heard about it, I wasn't allowed to go over there when he was home. My mom knew a weirdo's behavior when she saw it. Eight, I had a friend who instead of washing the dishes after a meal, just put them straight back in the cupboard. I thought his parents would freak out, but it turns out it was just something they did in their house. Whenever I went over, I always made sure to eat beforehand. 9, my friend must ask his father before he is allowed to eat anything in their house. One time our group of friends wanted to go out on a Friday night. We asked if he could come and our friend said he was grounded. We asked him what he did this time and he responded, I ate a bowl of cereal when my dad wasn't home. Probably the saddest thing I've ever heard someone get grounded for. And if I went over to eat dinner with them, I was given the options of water, bottled water, mineral water or milk. I would say milk, but apparently when you say Milk, that translates to a glass of water. 11. Don't put keys on the table. Superstition that supposedly brings bad luck. I guess I have terrible luck. Been doing it all my life.

One, I have to give pretty bad news on a frequent basis. Most people know it's coming. During my last week in residency, I had to tell a mother that her daughter wasn't going to make it. She came in talking the night before and had surgery for a life threatening problem. We thought she would make it. After halfway through the day, her vitals and labs took a nose dive and it was obvious that our efforts had only temporized her, but we lost. She was intubated and peaceful, but she was young and had two small kids. We have all seen the TV drama style screams, pounding on the table, begging for someone to do something, sobbing. When it's reality, it's so much harder. Her mom was crying on the floor asking me to take her organs to save her daughter. I'm not emotional, but that day wrecked me. I went to the bar after with my attending and we didn't talk. I try not to think about it. 2 er DOC, I just had a young lady brought in. She was only 22. Her brother came as we were coding her chest compressions. We had done everything and there was no bringing her back. I asked if he wanted to be in the room when we stopped and he said yes. His reaction was heartbreaking. Screamed and cried and then Picked up her body and whispered in her ear, I love you so much, you're my best friend. And just held her and kept saying, I love you. All the staff had to take a moment after that. I'll never forget them. 3, telling a very young patient that their condition, which was assumed to be curable through surgery, was in fact not so because it had spread to the brain. It was a rare condition that rarely spreads and that rarely affects younger people. Some people get all the terrible luck in the world. The patient was remarkably stoic, but one of the parents lost it. The tears, wailing, pleading and breakdown aren't anything I'll forget. The rage against the system, the accusations, I must be wrong, and then the pleading and tears again. I think it's the fact I took their hope away from them. There is no happy ending to this story, but I'm the one who had to tell them. Years later, I can still see their face and grief. It's burnt into my memory. And it took a while to accept that perhaps trying so hard to forget would disrespect the patient's memory. I'm trained to deliver bad news and do it regularly. This one remains one of the only times where a case utterly emotionally broke me. Four, a patient of mine I hadn't seen in forever came to emerge because he couldn't manage at home, was too weak and losing weight. Blue collar Guy, I took one look at the 50 pound weight loss on him and knew, DOC, I think I'm on the way out. He said, not going to lie to you. I'm worried about that too, I said. Five, not a doctor, but a midwife. Whenever a pregnant patient comes in with reduced movement, I hold my breath until we find the Houdini's heartbeat. But sometimes it's not there. The gut wrenching cry of a parent being that there is no heartbeat is unmistakable. It gets me every time. 6. I told a woman that her husband wasn't going to make it and I didn't know why and probably couldn't do anything to prevent it. She thanked me and later sent a card after her husband passed. I hope she's doing okay. 7. Nurse here. I once stood in the hall and listened while a surgeon told a 22 year old girl that after weeks of trying, the only option left was to amputate her leg. The sound the girl made will never leave me. 8. Probably the one that stands out is telling a young dad that his wife and baby passed in a road transport accident. I think it was the whimpering, soft crying that got me got out of critical care. After too many of those types of situations. It was wearing me down. 9. Patience. Mom, are you telling me that I am going to lose my son today? Me? Yes.

That's why you're blocked until I'm home. When she came back expecting me at the airport, she found out who was really waiting for her. I run a cyber security firm. My fiance Rachel and I had been together for four years. Wedding planned for December. She announced a Miami bachelorette trip with her sister Emma, cousin Sophia, and best friend Megan. When I offered to book their hotel through my corporate account for a discount, she snapped. Don't need to know where we're staying. Why do you need to control everything? It's a girl's trip, David. You don't need to know what happens on a girl's trip. That's why you're blocked until I'm home. Then she held out her hand. Your ring stays here. What happens in Miami stays in Miami. I slipped off my engagement ring without argument. Her triumphant smile told me everything. She'd already decided what would happen in Miami. That night, I activated the parental controls I'd installed on her phone months earlier when fixing her hacked Instagram. He'd forgotten about the admin access. Her sister Emma texted their group. Can't believe David bought that Bachelorette story. The wedding photographer wants confirmation. He's lying down Thursday. Wedding photographer? Our wedding wasn't until December.

The pilot filed A flight plan to Turks and Caicos, where you can marry immediately without waiting period. Her maid of honor, Megan, posted a story from the plane. In her champagne glass reflection, I saw a man's hand wearing a Princeton class ring. I knew that ring. It belonged to Connor, her ex who dumped her for a job in Switzerland five years ago. The one she cried about for months. One whose mother told her she wasn't good enough for their family. Her location showed the Beaches Resort Chapel. Through the resort's public webcam, I watched my fiance in a white dress exchanging vows with Connor while her friends smiled. The same friends who'd eaten dinner at my house two nights ago. But Connor wasn't the only one with a secret. His job in Switzerland was actually federal prison for embezzlement. He'd been released six months ago, broke, desperate with fraud convictions that meant no legitimate firm would touch. I called Rachel's father, a federal judge who'd been saving for our wedding. I sent him screenshots of Connor's criminal record, his bench warrant for unpaid restitution, and live footage of his daughter marrying a convicted felon who owed the government $3.8 million. Judge Miller was on the next flight out with federal marshals. Her sister Emma hadn't turned off location sharing. I sent her husband the coordinates showing her at the chapel during work hours when she claimed to be at a dental conference.

Um, hi. Who's this? I can't tell you that, but I go to your school. We've never talked, but I've had a crush on you since middle school. If you had a crush on me for so long, why have we never spoken? Because I'm scared and I don't know if you would feel the same way. Why don't we play a game? Okay. What kind of game? You have until July to figure out who I am. Is this an excuse to get me to talk to you for the whole year? Pretty much. Why not? I do need to let you know I already have a crush on a girl in my school, so don't get your hopes up. That's fine. Let's see what happens. Hey, you looked hot today. You were watching me. It's kind of weird. Rizz app, respond with, how could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? How could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? Wow, that actually made me feel good. At least give me clues about yourself. Why? So I can at least get a starting point on who you are. Fine. I am blonde. That doesn't help me. There are lots of blonde girls in our school. Be more specific. I have a birthmark on my neck, so I have to go check every blonde girl's neck. So tell me about this girl. You like her name? Is Violet. She's perfect. We have never spoken, sadly. Do you know her, violet? Oops, sorry. I do know her. Maybe when I find out who you are, you can introduce me to her. You can ask her right now and she will say yes. How can you be so sure? I'm too scared to ask her. Don't worry. She is nice. Okay. Good night, mystery girl. I'm going to get some sleep. Good night. What? I don't get a message today? Ah. Does someone miss me in your dreams? I was just surprised how my crush since middle school hadn't messaged me today. I have a question for you. Sure. Ask away. How could you have loved me for so long if we haven't spoken ever? You are handsome. The way you talk to people, you are such a kind soul, polite. You make everyone laugh. You are a gentleman. I always knew you are what I always wanted. Now I really wanna know who you are. Patience. Hey, hey, can I admit something to you? Sure. I'm not interested in Violet anymore. Really? How come? She's beautiful. So beautiful that I was too scared to even go near her. That's the issue. She's perfect in every way, but I have fallen for someone else. Someone who I do speak to, someone who understands me, someone without a name or a face, but someone who loves me. The day you find out who I am, I hope we will. Be together. Me too. Mystery Girl, can I confess something to you? Sure. What's up? I think it's time to tell you who I am. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

Everyone laughed except me. I quietly raised my hot dog and said, challenge accepted. That night, I packed everything into two suitcases and left my key on the kitchen counter. No, no, no. Goodbye. Just gone. I've been the family doormat for 29 years, the one who organized every holiday, baked every birthday cake and cleaned up everyone's messes while they took selfies without me. So when mom made that joke at our BBQ with my aunts and siblings all laughing, something inside me just clicked. I moved three hours away to a lake by blocked everyone's numbers and started over as Jade instead of JD, the nickname that made me feel like a child. For the first week, my phone stayed silent, exactly like mom predicted. But week 2, my brother called 47 times. Turns out nobody knew how to work the washing machine I've been maintaining for years. Their clothes piled up like a laundry mountain until he finally had to buy new underwear instead of figuring out the spin cycle. Week 3, my sister showed up at my old job crying, begging my former co workers for my new number. She had a family emergency, aka, couldn't figure out how to renew her car registration, the same registration I've been handling for her since she was. My co workers told her I'd move states. Away. She broke down in the parking lot because she'd never even Learned where the DMB was located. She ended up paying $300 to some sketchy guy who promised to handle it. Dad drove to every apartment complex in the city looking for me. He'd never realized I was the one who remembered everyone's medication schedules, grocery lists and which bills were due when. Without me, he missed his blood pressure medication for three weeks and had to go to urgent care. The doctor asked if he had family support at home. Dad just stared at the floor and mumbled something about his daughter being away. Mom had a complete breakdown when she.

My husband came home from work last Tuesday with this look on his face that I knew meant trouble. He'd been on the phone with his ex wife all afternoon about Caleb, his 24 year old son. Caleb had overdosed again, fourth time this year. And this time they found him passed out in some gas station bathroom with a needle still hanging out of his arm. I was making dinner when my husband sat down at the kitchen table and just stared at me. My daughter Emma was upstairs doing homework, completely unaware of what was about to happen. He cleared his throat and said they needed $30,000 for an impatient rehab program, 60 days, some fancy place up in the mountains that supposedly had better success rates. I stopped stirring the pasta sauce and turned around $30,000. We'd already blown through almost $14,000 on outpatient programs that didn't work because Caleb either didn't show up or relapse the second he got out. I'd personally paid a thousand bucks for his first detox thinking maybe this time would be different. Then my husband paid 6,500 for another program. Then we split another sixty five hundred when Caleb swore on his dead grandmother's grave that he was ready to get clean. Here's the thing about Caleb. He'd stolen my wedding ring, my mother's jewellery, our t v, Emma's laptop and even loose change from Emma's piggy bank. The kid Had no problem looking a 15 year old girl in the eye and taking her birthday money. And every time it was the same story. He was sorry. He was gonna change. He just needed one more chance. So when my husband said they wanted to use Emma's college fund, I actually laughed, not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe he was serious. That money came from Emma's dad who died when she was 6. Her grandparents had been putting money in there since she was born, $180,000 that was meant to get her through whatever college she wanted without debt. Emma's crazy smart, like scary smart. Her teachers keep telling me she could get into Harvard or Yale if she keeps her raises up. But even with scholarships, those schools cost a fortune and our incomes too high to qualify for financial aid. That money was supposed to be her safety net, her ticket to whatever future she wanted. I told my husband absolutely not. The fund was off limits, period. That's when he lost it, started yelling about how I was choosing money over his son's life, how addiction was a medical condition, how we had a moral obligation to help family. He kept saying medical emergencies come before education, like Emma going to college with some luxury instead of her entire future. The worst part happened three days later. I came home from work early and found my husband and Emma sitting at the Kitchen table. She looks like she'd been crying. And there were all these pamphlets spread out about the rehab place. My husband had asked her directly if she'd be willing to give up 30,000.

I knew dating Rachel meant getting past her three older brothers, but I had no idea they'd turned protecting her into a military operation. She'd been with a guy named Jeff for two years, and he'd broken her jaw when she tried to leave him. So now her brothers treated every man who looked at her like a potential, actual threat. The first time I picked her up for dinner, her oldest brother answered the door holding a baseball bat like he was stepping up to home plate. The middle brother stood behind him, cracking his knuckles, while the youngest just stared at me, taking photos with his phone, probably for some criminal database they were building. Rachel pushed past them, looking mortified, but I caught the oldest one mouthing, we're watching you. As we walked to my car. They threw literally everything at me to see if I'd crack or run away screaming. Every restaurant we went to, somehow one brother would already be there, pretending to read a menu upside down while photographing my every move. During our third date, the youngest brother actually sat down at our table uninvited and said, so what exactly are your intentions with our sister? Because we've got shovels, and we know how to use them. Instead of getting angry, I looked him straight in the eye and said, my intention is to never give you a reason. To use them, which made him blink first. They ran background checks and left the results on my windshield with certain things circled in red marker like a teacher grading papers. The middle brother created a fake Instagram profile as a woman named Jessica and sent me messages trying to get me to cheat, but I just screenshot everything and sent them to Rachel saying, your brother needs to work on his catfishing skill because Jessica types exactly like him. When they followed us to the movies, I bought them popcorn and had the usher deliver it to their seats with a note saying next time just join us instead of lurking, which actually made the youngest one laugh. I started leaving gift cards for coffee on their trucks when I spotted them tailing us with notes like stalking must be exhausting, so caffeine's on me, and eventually the oldest brother actually used one. The breakthrough came when I showed up at their mother's birthday even though Rachel warned me they told me the wrong time on purpose. I arrived three hours early with flowers for their mom and helped her cook while she told me embarrassing stories about all four of her kids. By the time everyone else arrived, I was wearing her apron and knew about the time the oldest brother cried watching The Lion King at age 16. He pulled me aside later and said that was sneaky as hell, but he was almost smiling when He said it. After two months of this dance, where I matched every test with patience and humor, the middle brother finally asked me directly, why haven't you given up yet? We've broken seven guys before you. I told him the truth. That Rachel was worth whatever bizarre hazing ritual they needed to put me through. The real test came during Rachel's company holiday party, when I stepped outside for air and found all three brothers waiting by my car. The oldest one stepped forward and said, she's getting attached. We need to know if you're going to hurt her. Before I could answer, we heard Rachel scream from the parking garage and saw her backing away from a man I recognized from photos as Jeff, who'd been released early for good behaviour. Her brothers froze, but I shoved past them and put myself between Jeff and Rachel. Jeff laughed and said, who's this clown supposed to be? And I

Oh no, you are not going to be bent over him with your chest in his face while you massage his head just so that you can bring him back here and continue to play with his hair. You know what? Here, what are you doing? I'm giving you the shear so that you can finish your boyfriend's hair because it is clear that no one who shares the same anatomy as you should be touching him unless it is you. So next time, either take him to a barber or do it yourself. Well, could you just finish? No, because you have been rude to me since the beginning and I have tried to brush it off, but it makes absolutely no sense to come to a hair salon and get mad at a hair stylist for doing hair. Okay? And if I was the man stealing woman that you've already decided I am in your head, I would be pretty stupid to do it right in front of your face considering you're probably the one who's gonna be paying me and tipping me, probably not tipping me because any tip That he would give me would be perceived as flirting by you, right? So either you finish it or you get out. Come on, babe. We'll go somewhere else. I just wanted a haircut.

You're not allowed to go outside. Why not? Everyone else gets to leave. I watched my classmates file past her into the hallway. Mrs. Paxton waited until the last student left before closing the door. She turned to me with that fake concerned face adults make when they think something's wrong with you. Cause of your sickness, you need to stay inside. What sickness are you talking about? I don't have any sicknesses. I felt fine and hadn't missed a single day of school all year. She walked over and put her hand on my shoulder. Sweetie, your mom told us everything. I'm not allowed to discuss it with you. If you leave this classroom, there will be consequences. Before I could ask more questions, she grabbed her lunch bag and headed for the door. She said she'd be right back after heating up her food in the teacher's lounge. The door clicked shut behind her, and I was alone in the empty classroom. Through the windows, I could hear all my friends playing outside. Carla's laugh echoed across the playground. Someone was bouncing a basketball on the blacktop. The swings creaked back and forth, normal recess sounds that I should have been part of. I tried to focus on homework, but couldn't concentrate. What sickness was Missus Paxton talking about? Mom hadn't mentioned anything. At breakfast, I felt my forehead, but it wasn't hot. My Throat didn't hurt. I wasn't coughing or sneezing. Nothing made sense. Ten minutes passed, then 15. The sounds outside got louder as more kids finished lunch and joined recess. I could see them through the window running around and having fun while I sat trapped at my desk like I was in detention. But I hadn't done anything wrong. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. I needed to get out of this room and find out what was going on. I walked to the door and turned the handle. It didn't budge. I tried again, harder. The door was locked from the outside. Missus Paxton had actually locked me in. Panic started creeping up my chest. This wasn't normal. Teachers don't lock students in classrooms. I banged on the door, hoping someone in the hallway would hear me. The sound echoed in the empty room, but no one came through the little window in the door. I saw Mr Al Monte walking by with his coffee mug. I knocked frantically on the glass until he noticed me. He looked confused and came over to investigate. I could see him trying the door handle from the outside. Please let me out. I pressed my face against the glass. He was reaching for his keys when Missus Paxton appeared out of nowhere. She grabbed his arm and pulled him aside. I couldn't hear what she whispered, but I saw his expression change. His eyes went wide and he actually took a step Back from the door, Missus Paxton whispered something else, and Mr Almonty's face went pale. He looked at me through the window like I was dangerous, like I was some kind of monster instead of a normal fifth grader. Without a word, he backed away and hurried down the hall. Missus Paxton gave me a sad smile through the window before walking away, too. She didn't even try to explain, just left me locked in like a prisoner. I slumped against the door, feeling more alone than ever. The classroom phone on Missus Paxton's desk caught my eye. If no one would tell me what was happening, maybe mom would. I knew I wasn't supposed to use it, but this was an emergency. Being locked in a classroom had to count as an emergency. I dialed Mom's cell number from memory. She picked up on the third ring, sounding distress, probably working from home like usual. She asked why the school was calling. And I explained everything, the locked door, the mysterious sickness, the way Mister Al Monte looked terrified of me. Mom went quiet for so long, I thought the call dropped. Then I heard her sigh, not an annoyed sigh, but a sad one, the kind she made when she had to tell me something bad, like when Grandpa got sick. I was hoping we'd have more time before this conversation. Her voice was shaky. Mom, what's wrong with me? What sickness does everyone know about except me? I gripped the phone tighter. Oh, honey, I should have told you sooner, but I didn't know how. The doctor said it might not manifest until you were older, but I guess it's starting now. She was definitely crying. What's starting? Mom, you're scaring me. My own eyes started watering. Listen carefully. What I'm about to tell you is going to change everything. Full story on channel link below.

I raised my hand as a joke. I helped my mom watch YouTube videos when she was pregnant with my brother. Does that count? The class laughed and I smiled, proud of my quick thinking. But Mister Gonzalez wasn't smiling. His face had gone completely white and his hands were shaking as he gripped the edge of his desk. Good. Come with me now. The entire classroom went silent in South Dallas when a teacher used that tone. You didn't ask questions. Everyone stay in your seats. Do not leave this room. If I'm not back in 20 minutes, have someone call 9, 1 1. He was already pulling me toward the door and that's when I noticed the dark stain on his sleeve. It looked wet. It looked like blood. Mr Gonzalez, what? What's happening? Is someone hurt? I tried to pull my arm free, but his grip was iron tight. I don't think I'm qualified for whatever. You're the only one who raised their hand. He cut me off. That makes you qualified. Outside, his car was already running with the doors open. She said she had until Thursday. He kept muttering while speeding out of the school parking lot. The midwife isn't answering her phone. I gripped the door handle, calculating if I could jump out at the next red light. Mr Gonzales, you're scaring me. Should I call my mom? No. He's swerved around a car and I slammed into the window. No one can know. Put your phone away. Turn it off. I'm not turning off my phone, I shouted, but I did anyway. We were going 50 in a 25 zone and Mister Gonzalez kept checking his mirrors like someone was following us. Finally, he pulled into a driveway of a small yellow house that definitely wasn't his. Listen to me. He grabbed my shoulders before we got out. They can't know she was here. Do you understand? No matter what happens, they can't know. I don't understand anything. I was practically yelling, now I'm 17. I don't even have my license yet. Marco. He used my name for the first time, his voice desperate. You've kept bigger secrets than this. I know your family. I need that same silence now. He wasn't wrong. I'd already seen two drive bys this year and never said a word to the cops. But this felt different. He shoved a pair of surgical gloves into my hands. Put these on. The front door was unlocked. Inside, we followed the sound of crying to a back bedroom. A woman was curled up on a bare mattress. She looked young, maybe early 20s, with long black hair stuck to her face with sweat. It's too early, she gasped in accented English when she saw us. Then she looked at me and started crying harder. He's just a child. You brought a child. I'm 17. I said, stupid. Like that made any difference. I watch Grey's anatomy if that helps. She switched to Spanish and started begging Mister Gonzales for something I couldn't understand. He pushed me toward her. Check how dilated she is. What? I backed up so fast I knocked over a lamp. I don't know how to do that. I've never even seen a. I can't. Then hold her hand and pretend you know what you're doing, he snapped. That's when I noticed the medical supply eyes. A whole closet full of them. Some of the boxes were labelled property of Saint Mary's Hospital in red letters. Are those stolen? I heard myself ask. My voice sounded far away. Did you steal from a hospital? No. Both of them shouted at once. The woman grabbed my hand so hard it hurt. Her nails dug into my skin through the gloves. Just, just don't call the hospital. They'll send me back my family. She switched to spam. Finish again, crying about money and payments and someone named Elena. I don't understand. I was crying now, too. Someone please tell me what's happening. Mister Gonzales was putting on surgical gloves with practice movements that made me wonder how many times he'd done this before. Check her phone. He ordered me. See if the embassy called. I had to pull the glove off with my teeth. The screen lit up with missed calls and texts. Immigration enforcement had called six times in the last Hour. There's something here about immigration, I said. My whole body was shaking. They called six times. They know, the woman sobbed. Someone told them the van will come. Someone's looking. I pointed at the window with my bloody hand. The neighbors see us. Get away from the window, Mister Gonzalez barked at me. I dropped to the floor and crawled to the corner, leaving bloody handprints on the carpet. To the woman, he spoke softly in Spanish, checking how dilated she was. She's at 9 cm, said you need to help me. I don't know what that means. If they find out about the surrogacy, the woman gasped between contractions. They'll deport me before I get the money for it. My daughter needs surgery. Please, you promise to help. Surrogacy, the word clicked in my brain. This isn't your baby. She shook her head, tears streaming. China, baby for China parents.

My son was diagnosed with a rare heart condition when he was 4. By the time he turned 7, he needed a specialized surgery that only one doctor in Boston could perform. The procedure cost $123,000, and our insurance denied coverage, calling it experimental. We'd already sold our house and moved into a tiny apartment. I was working two jobs while my husband took care of our son, whose condition was deteriorating rapidly. His lips would turn blue during even mild activity, and he'd started having fainting spells. Last month, his cardiologist called us in for an emergency appointment. His heart was failing faster than they expected. If he doesn't get this surgery within three weeks. I don't think he couldn't finish the sentence, but we understood. We were still $11,000 short, despite the gofundme and community fundraisers. I picked up a third job at an upscale hotel bar in downtown Chicago, working overnight shifts after my day jobs. I was surviving on two to three hours of sleep, but nothing mattered except getting that money. On my fifth night, I was so exhausted I could barely stand. That's when Keanu Reeves walked in alone, around 1:00am. He was in town filming. According to the local news. He wore simple clothes and looked tired, sitting at the far end of the empty bar. I recognized him immediately, but could see he wanted privacy. I just nodded and Asked, what can I get you? No name, no recognition. He ordered a whiskey, neat and asked for the food menu. While making his drink. My hands were shaking from exhaustion. I dropped a glass and it

On September 8, 2025, workers at a Hollywood tow yard noticed a foul odor coming from a 2023 Tesla registered to singer David Anthony Burke, aka David, the 20 year old artist behind viral hits like Romantic Homicide and feel it. The car had been abandoned in the Hollywood Hills after it was impounded days earlier. But when police opened it around noon, they discovered a decomposed body wrapped in plastic and stuffed into the front trunk. The remains were so badly decayed that identification wasn't possible on the spot as the LAPD quickly handed the case over to homicide detectives in the county coroner. At the time of the discovery, David was actively on his withered world tour, posting on social media and preparing for upcoming shows, making it unclear whether he had any connection to the car's contents. Authorities have not released the victim's identity and emphasize that it's unknown if David himself is involved in the case, which remains an active homicide investigation.

In my family, the oldest son doesn't cry, ever. My grandfather never shed a tear when his brother died in Vietnam. My dad didn't even blink when his own father passed. They called it being strong. I called it suffocating. When my younger brother Jake took his own life at 22, I was supposed to be the rock, stand tall at the funeral, comfort everyone else, keep it together, because that's what oldest sons do. But I couldn't breathe, literally. I'd wake up gasping at 3 a. M, remembering how Jake used to sneak into my room during thunderstorms when we were kids, how he text me memes at midnight just to make me laugh. How I missed every single warning sign because I was too busy being the perfect oldest son. Three weeks after the funeral, I was losing it. I hadn't slept more than two hours at a time. I'd sit in my car in random parking lots and just scream until my throat hurt. My girlfriend Emma kept begging me to talk to someone, anyone. So I did something no man in my family had ever done. I googled therapists near me and booked an appointment under the name Mike Johnson because I was terrified someone would recognize my real name. Doctor Martinez was this tiny woman with kind eyes who didn't make me feel like a freak for crying in her office. She taught me Breathing exercises helped me understand that grief doesn't have a timeline, that it was okay to fall apart. I started going every Tuesday at two PM for the first time since Jake died, I could sleep through the night. I even started cooking again instead of living off gas station sandwiches. But then my mom found the appointment reminder card that fell out of my jeans pocket when she was doing laundry. Therapy, she said the word like it was a disease. What will people think? When my dad got home from his construction job, she showed him the card. His face went red, then purple. Are you kidding me right now? He slammed his lunch box on the counter. You're telling some stranger our family business making us look weak? I, I tried explaining that therapy wasn't about blame, that I never even mentioned them, that I just needed help processing losing Jake. You're the oldest, my dad said, pointing his finger at my chest. That means something in this family. Act like it. When I told them I wasn't stopping therapy, everything changed overnight. My dad stopped talking to me completely, just grunted when I said hello. My mom would make dinner for three people instead of four, leaving me to figure out my own food. And the extended family got involved. My Aunt Carol, who used to invite me to every barbecue, suddenly had limited space when she threw parties. My cousin Beth uninvited me from her Wedding because my.

About 15 years ago, my dad completely destroyed one of my mom's green dinner plates. She had this whole matching set of those Corelle dishes with the little green daisies that basically every house had back in the late 70s. This was the very first plate to ever break, and my dad was absolutely mortified. He jumped in his car and drove straight to Walmart, bought some random plain white plate, and snuck it to the bottom of the stack in our cabinet. He figured if he buried it deep enough, maybe mom would never notice. Wrong move, dad. The sneaky plate got discovered during one of our family gatherings when all us kids were home visiting. My two older sisters and I were helping with dinner prep, and someone pulled out all the plates to set the table. There it was, this random white plate, sitting there like a sore thumb among all the green daisy ones. Since I'm the youngest kid, guess who got blamed? Yep. Me. Mom was convinced I'd broken her precious plate and tried to cover it up with this mismatched replacement. My sisters just stood there smirking while I got lectured about honesty and taking responsibility. I tried explaining it wasn't me, but nobody believed the baby of the family. That's when something clicked in my petty little brain. If I was gonna get blamed for mismatched plates anyway, why not make it my thing? So I started my mission. Every time I visited Mom's house, I'd bring a little gift another random corolle plate to add to her collection. I hit up thrift stores, garage sales, eBay, anywhere I could find weird corolle patterns, Star Wars lunch, and plates from some limited edition perfect Disney dessert plates with faded cartoon characters into the cart. Plates with printing mistakes or weird colour combinations? Don't mind if I do. The best part was being sneaky about it. I'd wait until mom was distracted watching TV or talking on the phone, then slip into the kitchen and bury my latest find somewhere in the middle of her plate stack. Sometimes I'd space them out, hide one during Christmas, another during Easter, maybe slip one in during a random Tuesday visit. Mom started noticing her plates were getting weird but couldn't figure out why. She'd pull out a stack for dinner and find a random rainbow striped plate or one with some corporate logo on it. She'd hold it up looking confused, asking if anyone knew where it came from. We'd all just shrug and say maybe she forgot she bought it. For months I kept this up, watching her plate collection slowly turn into this bizarre mismatched mess. Every family dinner became this guessing game of what weird plate someone would end up with. My nephew got stuck with a plate that had dancing tacos on it. My sister in law ended up eating off something that looks like it came from A hospital cafeteria. But today. Today was my masterpiece. I've been stalking eBay for weeks waiting for the perfect opportunity. Finally found a seller with three brand new green Daisy Corolle dinner plates, the exact same pattern as Mom's original set. I drove over to Mom's house this morning with my secret weapon. Told her I wanted to borrow her casserole dish for a potluck, which gave me the perfect.

Our town had this problem that made everyone lose their minds. Lake Morrison was basically dying. Every summer, the water would drop so low you could walk halfway across it and all the fish would just float belly up. It smelled like hot garbage mixed with dead seafood. This was killing our town because Lake Morrison was literally our only claim to fame. Every summer, families would drive three hours to camp and fish here. But for the past five years, they'd show up to find a giant MUD puddle with some sad water in the middle. The town council went absolutely nuts trying to fix it. They hired three different engineering firms for over $200,000. One expert blamed climate change. Another said our pipes were ancient. The third guy insisted it was bad drainage from the new shopping centre. Every month, there was a town hall meeting that turned into a screaming match. People were furious about their tax money being wasted. Missus Patterson would stand up and yell about her dead koi pond. Jim from the bait shop said he might have to close because nobody was buying worms anymore. Last August, the biggest meeting yet was packed wall to wall. The mayor looked exhausted as person after person complained. That's when Curtis Webb stood up from the back row. Curtis was this quiet guy who fixed people's sheds and cleaned gutters. He drove this beat up blue Truck with paint cans rattling around in the back. Most people barely knew his name. Wore the same faded overalls every day, and had this habit of adjusting his baseball cap when he talked. Curtis cleared his throat and said, I think the water is leaking through the West Dam. There's probably a crack or something. The room went dead silent. Then Councilman Bradley actually laughed out loud. Curtis, we've had actual engineers examine every inch of that damn. I think they know more than someone who hammers nails for a living. People started whispering and snickering. Curtis just nodded, sat back down, and didn't say another word. That weekend, Curtis rented A kayak from the Marina for 20 bucks. He paddled out to the west side of the damn, where nobody ever went because it was all thick woods and mosquitoes. He brought his old flip phone that still recorded videos. What he found was insane. There was this crack in the concrete about the size of a basketball, and water was just pouring out like a broken fire hydrant. It was shooting straight into the woods where nobody could see it from shore. Curtis filmed the whole thing.
