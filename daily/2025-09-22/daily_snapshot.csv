My roommate Kate has this incredible superpower of she can selectively forget her wallet every single time we go somewhere that cost money. But somehow she never forgets it when she's going shopping alone or getting her nails done. We've been living together for eight months, and I've been keeping track. She's forgotten her wallet 17 times. 17! And every single time, she gives me this look like I'm supposed to cover her because I have a corporate job and she's a freelance artist. Last Tuesday, she comes bouncing into our apartment with this huge grin. Guess what? I booked us a table at Meridian for my birthday dinner Friday night. I invited Jessica, Mike, and L, Too. Meridian, the place where appetizers start at $35. I knew exactly what was coming. This was going to be her biggest scam yet. Order expensive food for everyone on her special day, then conveniently forget her wallet and guilt everyone else into splitting the massive Bill. Friday night arrives. She's getting ready, humming some Taylor Swift song, completely in her element. I'm watching from my doorway as she does her usual routine. Phone, check. Keys, check. Lipstick, check. Tiny purse, check. She even did that fake little gasp and snap, like, got everything. As if to seal the performance. But there it was. Her wallet, sitting in plain sight on the nightstand, once again, mysteriously excluded from the essentials. It Was like watching someone rehearse a scam she's pulled off a dozen times. Wallet sitting on nightstand, ignored. I'm just going to touch up my mascara real quick. She calls out, heading to the bathroom. That's when I made my move. I slipped into her room and grabbed the wallet. Black leather. Kind of heavy, actually. I could feel credit cards and cash inside. We meet everyone at the restaurant. Meridian has this whole upscale vibe. Dim lighting, fancy cloth napkins. Waiters in actual uniforms. Kate is in full birthday girl mode, telling everyone to order whatever they want. It's my special day. Go crazy. Jessica orders a forty dollar salmon. Mike gets the 55 dollar steak. L goes for the lamb, which is like sixty dollars. Kate orders the seafood tower for herself. Eighty five dollars. We're laughing, having a good time, taking birthday photos. Kate is being the perfect hostess. Then the check comes. $230. Kate looks at it and starts patting down her tiny purse. Checking her jacket pockets, looking under the table. Oh my god, you guys, I am so embarrassed. I totally forgot my wallet at home. Here we go. Can someone cover me? I'll Venmo every

My husband always said he'd do anything to become a father, but I never imagined anything including my younger sister. We've been trying for three years. Every negative test felt like a tiny funeral while Mark sat beside me scrolling adoption sites like shopping online, sighing louder with each click. When my sister Emma offered to be our surrogate at Thanksgiving, I thought we caught a break. She'd already had two kids. I do anything for you, she said, squeezing my hand. Family helps family. I watched Mark's eyes meet hers across the table. That should have been my first warning. The fertility clinic quoted us $30,000 for IVF with surrogacy. Mark started a spreadsheet, calculating interest rates, loan options and even selling his motorcycle. Then one night over Chinese takeout, he sat down his chopsticks and said, what if we did it the traditional way? I laughed. What do you mean traditional? He leaned forward, completely serious. We skip the IVF. I just plant my seed directly in Emma. No medical costs, no procedures, same result. My chopsticks clattered to the table. He kept going, launching into this whole speech about efficiency and saving money, how people did it for centuries, how it would be clinical and quick, just a medical procedure without the medical bills. He said, I couldn't speak. I was too busy trying to process that my husband Had just asked to bang my sister. The guilt trip started immediately. I guess you don't really want kids. Other wives would understand the sacrifice. He even compared me to his coworker Janet, who'd done egg donation for her sister. Each comment was designed to make me feel selfish for saying no. By Week 3, Emma called me. Mark explained everything, she said, voice dripping with concern. I want you to know I'm open to it, whatever helps you become a mom. She went on about how it would be beautiful creating life for her sister and how the baby would be loved by everyone. I thanked her but said I wasn't sure yet and hung up. Then came the Thursday that changed everything. Mark was at his brother's bachelor party and I needed our insurance card for a dentist appointment. I searched his home office, rifling through his file filling cabinet and behind the tax returns, I found a Manila folder labeled medical. Inside were test results from two years before we married. Male factor infertility. Sperm count 0, completely sterile. My hands shook reading the urologist notes. Genital irreversible, no surgical options. He'd known every fertility appointment where he'd held my hand while doctors explained how my body was failing us every time I sobbed over negative tests. He knew he was the problem. I kept digging and opened his computer to see what else he might be hiding and saw text with my sister going back six Months. They talked about how once I agreed to the surrogacy, they wouldn't have to sneak around anymore, how this was really going to work and how they'd finally have a daughter of their own and make leaving me easy. They were actually joking about how simple their plan was. Emma wrote, she'll probably thank us for taking the burden off her. With a laughing emoji. Mark replied that they'd tell our families the baby needed her biological mom, that the child couldn't bond with me properly. Will look like we're doing what's best for the baby. He'd written, for stealing my life one text at a time. I could have left right then and there and dodged the biggest bullet of a lifetime, but what's the fun in that? So I called the one person he despised most, his older brother, Ryan, Harvard MBA investment banker. Daddy's favorite market's been our entire marriage. Making snide comments about Mister Perfect and trying to one up every story about Ryan's success. I laid it all out to Ryan, who just said, Jesus. Even for Mark, that's evil. When I told him I had an idea but needed his help, he didn't even hesitate. Whatever you're thinking, I'm in. From then on, I started acting defeated. I told Mark over breakfast, you're right, we should be practical about this. His whole face lit up like his plan was finally working. Later that same night, I asked Mark to meet me at home. For an important conversation. When he arrived, I was sitting calmly on the couch. I've been thinking about your suggestion about doing things tradition, I said. Mark leaned forward eagerly and, well, I found someone. We've already started trying. His face went white. What do you mean trying? You're infertile. Who? Oh, didn't I mention? Turned out I'm perfectly fertile. Just needed someone with working equipment. Called upstairs. You can come down now. Ryan walked down, adjusting his tie. Hey, little brother, thanks for the practical suggestion. I pulled out his fertility report and laid it out for him. Why are you upset? You're sterile. You've always been sterile. I held up my phone. Oh, and I just sent Emma your fertility report. All those promises about babies, she's finding out right now that you can't deliver. His jaw dropped as his phone started buzzing frantically. Came at me and said, you ruined my life. But Ryan was already dragging him toward the door. I filed for divorce the next morning and it was finalized after six months. Emma dumped him the moment she found out he was sterile and Mark lost everything. I'm focusing on myself now and honestly, I've never been happier. But I still think about Mark lying awake at night, wondering if his perfect brother really did screw his wife and when I might be expecting his brother's baby. I hope the thought eats him alive.

Girl, when I tell you, I almost fainted when the school called me. I ain't even playing. So it's a regular Thursday. I'm in the middle of target looking for a throw pillow that matches absolutely nothing. And my phone rings. Caller ID says Lincoln Elementary. My stomach dropped. I thought, oh, god, did she fall off the monkey bars again? Did she hit someone? Or worse, did she say something? Think she heard me say? So I answer all fake sweet, like, hi, this is her mom. And the lady on the other end says, ma'am, we need you to come in immediately. Your daughter had an incident. Now listen, my daughter Layla is cute, like real cute. Big eyes, big hair, big attitude. She's 8, but she's also part gremlin when she's hungry or bored. So I throw the pillows back, leave the cart and speed down to that school like it's the Indie 500. I walk in, heart pounding, and the secretary just points at the principal's office like, yeah, she's in there. Open the door and baby Layla is sitting there with her arms crossed like a little mob boss. Principal looking nervous. There's a boy across from her with an ice pack on his head and a teacher looking like she aged 10 years today. I go, Layla, what did you do? She goes, he tried to take my cookie. So I defended myself. Calm like she's In court, the principal sighs and says she hit him with a lunch tray. I blink, I'm sorry, she what? Now the teacher jumps in. She told the boy, touch it and you lose a finger. We thought she was joking. Next thing we know, he grabs her cookie and boom, metal tray to the forehead. I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing because I know where she got that line, me. She got it from me. I said that last week about my fries at Chili's. But I clear my throat and say, Layla, you can't go around hitting people. She, he tried to rob me. What was I supposed to do care like it's a fairy tale? That cookie had my name on it in Sharpie. I wrote it. Possession is 9/10 of the law, y'all. She hit him with legal terms. The boy starts sniffling like he's the victim. And Layla leans in and says, you should have asked. Now look at you, iced up like leftovers. I had to turn around and pretend to cough so I wouldn't laugh. I'm dying inside. The principal says, we don't condone violence. Layla goes, neither do I, but I condone consequences. I swear, this child is either gonna be a lawyer or in jail. So I take her home, try to give her a serious talk. I go, you can't be violent even if you're right. There's rules. She goes, exactly. Rule No. 1, don't touch my food. I said, Layla, I'm serious. She goes, okay, okay. Next time I'll use words. Maybe, probably. And then y'all ready for the kicker? That night, I get a text from the mom of the boy. I'm bracing myself.

They arrested him for theft, and not only was he expelled from the school, but actually spent the night in juvie.

Now he's trapped in his own mess. I was adopted and my foster parents treated me like their own kid and their kids treated me like their sibling, except for Chad. Chad was an insensitive a hole to everyone. He would fight our older sister, say horrible things to everyone. And his anger issues caused him to break doors and punch holes in walls. The worst thing was when he got up in front of our whole class year and told them I wasn't his sister and never would be. He claimed I would never be a part of his family and I should stop trying. He would keep doing this up until he moved out and I stopped talking to him. I have stayed as far away from him as possible, only seeing him for family pictures every year because our mother asks. Recently he got married and had a baby and everyone was congratulating him except for me. Our mom noticed and asked why I was distancing myself from him. I told her about high school and she said this is still my kid and it's my first grandbaby. And it was the reason she wasn't going to be upset over it. I knew that would happen. Out of nowhere, I got a message from Chad begging me to go babysit for Them because you're the only one who can deal with these kinds of babies because no one will help. He knows I have insomnia and that's why I don't mind staying up. I can't tell if that's a blessing or a curse at this point. For some reason, I accepted and went over at eight PM when I showed up, I was greeted by Chad's wife who had the biggest eye bags but still greeted me with a smile. She explained the baby's night route feedings and said they would be home around 12:30 at most. After this, Chad showed up, looked at me for over a minute and gave me a small wave, then left the house. His wife followed and told me to call or text if I needed anything. For a minute, I was just stunned but went to take care of the baby. He was fine the whole time. And then twelve thirty PM rolled around, but they weren't home. I decided to wait and then ended up texting them at one asking where they were. I got no reply from either of them. They finally showed up at 3 in the morning. I'm livid at this point. I walked into the living room and told them I was waiting for their response. Chad's wife said, oh, Chad said it was fine and that it would only be an hour more. I cut her off to say, it's fine, whatever, the baby's sleeping. I thought I Could walk out of there with my head held high. But when I walked past Chad, I blurted out, so you aren't going to say anything to me after I looked after your kid for seven hours? He snorted at me and was like, no, my wife is the one who talked me into this. Pissed off, I said, so this wasn't a way to apologize for high school or all those other times you outcast me from the family because I was under the impression that you'd want to patch things up? He snapped back, why should I apologize? Nothing from high school has changed. You really do need to just grow up and understand that me and my wife aren't going to cater to you like mom and dad did because you're adopted. You ain't our family and you won't ever be. I turned to his wife and told her she married a disgusting piece of crap and if he continues to act this way, his son will grow up to hate him, too. One day she'll resent him for what he is and she'll only have herself to blame. Chad got angry and said, I had no right to talk to her like that when not even my real family wanted me. I reminded him that his wife also has an adopted sister, told her that if this was the way he spoke about me, then what did she think he was saying about her sister? He Surely wasn't treating her like a princess. I could see that I was getting through to her. But then Chad punched a wall. Classic Chad. I screamed not out of fear, but because I wanted to wake the baby up out of pure spitefulness. Right on cue, we could hear him crying and Chad and his wife audibly groaned. Chad then asked me to go take care of the baby so he and his wife could go to sleep. I told him like hell and gave him the middle finger before leaving and slamming the door. From another relative, I heard that they had a big argument and his wife is currently staying with her parents. Her parents also had a change of heart towards him. Now he's claiming that I made him say that on purpose, which is ridiculous. I smell a divorce in the future.

When I was 17, my mom forced me to start babysitting, but I had no idea who I was doing it for. When I met this woman, I couldn't believe how overprotective she was. She had cameras in every room of the house and asked me to call her every half hour just to make sure her daughter was okay. She told me I wasn't allowed to do anything except watch her. And when she finally left, I basically just sat there for three hours doing nothing until she came home. She came back and basically ran into the room to make sure the girl was okay and I assured her everything was fine. I had long hair at the time and had put it up at this point. And should probably now mention I have severe hearing loss. I have to wear hearing aids, which can usually be easily mistaken for headphones. Then as I was standing up to say bye to the girl, her mom noticed them in my ears. She thought I was wearing headphones the whole time and wasn't paying attention to the little girl. This made her furious and a second later, I felt her grab my head. All I remember was feeling the worst pain I've ever felt in my ear. I turned around to see her holding my hearing aid and realized what she did. She thought I was listening to music, so she ripped my hearing Aid out of my ear thinking it was a headphone. And since they connect directly to my eardrum, she completely ripped that out, too. The pain was so intense I passed out and woke up in the hospital to my mom crying. She was livid. And even though they begged us not to, we sued her. I will never hear out of my ear again, but I'll never have to work again either.

My parents never planned to have another kid after Abby. She was their perfect little girl. Smart as hell. Played piano like Mozart, made honor roll every semester. But when she got hit by that drunk driver at age 8, everything changed. Nine months later, boom, there I was. I grew up thinking I lived in a museum, not a house. Abby's room stayed exactly how she left it. Her bed made perfectly, her soccer trophies lined up on the shelf. Even her stupid math homework still pinned to the bulletin board. Nobody was allowed in there, not even me. My parents acted like they were babysitting someone else's kid when I was around. They take maybe three photos of me a year. And that was being generous. My birthdays were these weird, quiet affairs where mom would make a cake and we'd all sit there eating it in silence. No friends, no parties, nothing. Every July, they pack their bags and disappear for a week to visit Abby's grave. They drop me off at Mrs. Henderson's house next door and act like I didn't exist. Mrs. Henderson was nice enough, but I always wondered why I couldn't come with them to see my own sister. When I turned thirteen, I finally asked dad about Abby during dinner. Big mistake. His fork hit the plate so hard, I thought it cracked. She was perfect, he snapped, not even looking. At me, you don't get to ask about her. Mom just stared at her food like it was the most interesting thing in the world. That's when it hit me. I wasn't their son. I was their do over. Their second chance at getting what they really wanted. High school was brutal. I'd watch other kids complain about their parents being too involved, too loud at games, too embarrassing. Meanwhile, mine forgot to show up to my graduation. They said they had to work late, but I saw dad's car in the driveway when I got home. That's when I started writing letters to Abby. Not because I believed in ghosts or anything, but because I needed to understand what made her so damn special that my parents couldn't love anyone else. Dear Abby, I wrote one night, I know you were awesome and everything, but I'm tired of living in your shadow. They wish you never died, and they wish I was never born. But here I am anyway. I left that letter taped to the attic door where they kept all her stuff. I figured if they wanted to worship their dead daughter so much, they might as well read what their living son had to say. The next morning, I found a dusty photo album slid under my bedroom door. No note, no explanation. Just this old book filled with baby pictures. My

Savannah had been stealing my moment since we were kids. At my 10th birthday, she blew out my candles to help me. At my high school graduation, she wore white and told everyone we were both graduating even though she was a sophomore. At my engagement dinner, she spent the night telling Nathan's family how she introduced us, even though they met at work. Cancer diagnosis was just another moment for her to steal. Two days after my diagnosis, Savannah moved into our house without asking. She made a Caringbridge page but wrote everything from her perspective. Every post started with how hard it was for her to watch me suffer. Friends praised her dedication while I spent hours throwing up from chemo. Three weeks in, I asked if Nathan could drive me to appointment, sometimes started crying and said I was pushing her away during the hardest time of her life. She posted about how sick people lash out at caregivers. Nathan said I should apologize. By month 2, she reorganized our entire house. I moved Nathan's things to the guest room and started screening my calls. She turned away visitors saying stress would hurt my recovery. She joined Nathan for evening runs to discuss my care. They'd come back sweaty and avoid eye contact. Four months into treatment, my white count dropped and the nurse sent me home early. I Took an Uber because Savannah had our car for shopping. I heard voices from our bedroom and climbed the stairs slowly. When I opened the door, they were in my bed. Savannah was wearing the anniversary pajamas Nathan bought me. She, I jumped up wearing my robe and rushed over with fake concern. She asked why I was home early and said I must be confused from the medications. She actually told Nathan to call my nurse about hallucinations. He just sat there in his boxers while she performed. My legs gave out. I slid down the door frame, realizing she'd stolen my husband while I was fighting cancer. Nathan finally said, I've been distant and Savannah understood his stress better. He compared his stress to my cancer. They moved out next week. Savannah told everyone I'd become paranoid from treatment. She posted about watching loved ones lose themselves to illness. People praised her for setting boundaries. Most friends believed her. I finished three months of treatment alone. No one cheered when I rang the bell. I recorded it myself but deleted it that night on my bathroom floor. I decided Savannah had stolen from me my whole life. This time would be different. During recovery, I studied Savannah's patterns like I was planning a battle. I made fake social media accounts to track her posts and learn her routines. Found out she had joined a fancy yoga studio and was flirting with her married instructor. She worked at a Marketing firm downtown and volunteered for their charity events. She and Nathan had rented a condo near the river. I mapped out her entire life and looked for weak spots. I joined her yoga studio but went to different class times, became friends with the instructor's wife at the juice bar next door. We bonded over books and recovery stories without me mentioning Savannah. When Savannah started asking for private sessions, his wife was already suspicious. She found on their text messages and confronted Savannah in the packed studio lobby. She read every flirty message out loud. While Savannah tried to cry her way out, the entire studio turned against her. Next, I joined the board of her company's charity foundation as a cancer survivor advocate. At their annual gala, I gave a speech about finding strength during treatment. I started by describing the loneliness of chemo and how cancer strips away fake.

My 12 year old daughter Adeline takes the bus home from school every day. She's always been chatty about her day. But last week something changed. She started mentioning this nice man who always sits behind her and asks about her homework, her friends, what she likes to do after school. Red flags everywhere. At first I thought maybe she was just being friendly. But then Adeline said he'd complimented her hair and asked if she walked home alone from the bus stop. When she told me he knew which stop was hers, even though he never got off there, my stomach dropped. I decided to follow the bus route in my car the next afternoon. Sure enough, there's this guy in his 40s who gets on at the stop right after Adeline's school. He's not dressed like someone heading to work, no briefcase, no uniform, just sitting there in a baseball cap watching the kids. Followed the bus for three stops. He never got off, just rode it to the end of the route, then walked back to his car parked at the school. When Adeline told me he'd offered her candy and asked where exactly we lived, including what our house looked like, I knew I had to act fast. Next morning I called in sick to work and got on that bus myself, sat three rows behind him with sunglasses and a hoodie up. Adeline didn't even notice. Me boarding. I watched him scan every kid getting on, but his eyes locked on Adeline the moment she stepped up those bus steps. He immediately moved to the seat directly behind her and started his routine. How was school today, sweetheart? Did you think about what I said yesterday about our little secret? Adeline looked uncomfortable but was trying to be polite. Um, I guess so. Good girl. Smart girls like you deserve special treats. Maybe we could meet up sometime when your parents aren't around. I know a place near your house where we could talk. That's when I stood up. Walk.

My boyfriend Jake had this super important work party coming up. He kept telling me how fancy it was and how I needed to look good for his boss and co workers. He even said his promotion might depend on making the right impression. I went shopping and found this gorgeous red dress at Nordstrom. It was classy, but had a little slit up the side. Perfect for a fancy company event, right? The day of the party, I spent hours getting ready. Did my hair, makeup, nails, the whole thing. When Jake saw me, he froze. He looked me up and down and said the dress was too much. I asked what he meant, and he said it was too flashy for his work people. I was confused because it wasn't even that revealing. He suggested I change into something more conservative, but we were already running late, so I said I'd be fine. He got quiet and weird in the car, checking his phone constantly. When we got to the hotel ballroom, I immediately noticed something was off. All the other women were dressed super plain, like boring black dresses and beige pantsuits. I looked around and realized I was the only one wearing anything with color or style. Jake introduced me to his boss, Mr. Williams, who seems nice enough. But then I met his co workers and their wives. They were all giving Me these weird looks and whispering to each other. One woman, Janet, came up and asked where I got my dress. I told her Nordstrom. She said, oh, that's expensive, and walked away. During dinner, I overheard two wives talking behind me. One said something about how some people try too hard to get attention. The other laughed and said, young girls these days don't know how to dress appropriately. I realised they were talking about me. My face turned hot with embarrassment. Jake barely talked to me all night. He kept checking his work phone and avoiding eye contact. When I tried to join conversations, people would smile politely then change the subject. I felt like everyone was judging me for my dress choice. During the award ceremony, I excused myself to the bathroom. In the bathroom, I ran into another woman around my age. She introduced herself as Lisa and said she was there with her husband.

Nathan and I dated for three years before I realised he was cheating with his coworker Michelle from the marketing department. When I found out, I packed my stuff that same night, blocked him on every social media platform, and moved across town to start fresh. I deleted his number, threw away his hoodies, and promised myself I'd never look back. Six months later, I'm marrying David, the kindest man I've ever met. We met at a coffee shop where he was reading the same obscure philosophy book I was. He's patient, thoughtful, and treats me like I'm worth everything. Perfect ceremony.

My mom is crying happy tears in the front row. David's grandmother flew in from Italy just for this moment. Everything is absolutely perfect, right? As Pastor Williams asks if. If anyone objects to this union, Nathan bursts through the heavy oak doors wearing a wrinkled navy suit that looks like he slept in it. I have to stop this! He shouts dramatically, strutting down the aisle like he's the main character in some romantic comedy. Audrey, you're making a huge mistake marrying this guy! Everyone gasps audibly. My bridesmaids look horrified, mouths hanging open. David squeezes my hand. Supportively whispering, it's okay. We got this. Love you. Nathan reaches the altar, breathing heavily from his dramatic entrance, sweat beating on his forehead. This woman is a complete fraud. She's been lying to all of you about who she really is. Pastor Williams tries to stay composed, adjusting his wire rimmed glasses. Sir, this is highly inappropriate. Please leave immediately or I'll call security. No, they need to know the truth. Nathan interrupts, gesturing wildly with his hands. Audrey told me she was saving herself for marriage, but I have proof she's been with other men. She's not the pure Christian girl she pretends to be. She's a liar! A few people gasp. My aunt clutches her pearls. One of the groomsmen mutters, bro, this isn't high school. Even the flower girl looks up like, what is this man doing? The church goes dead silent. You could hear a pin drop. I feel my face burning with embarrassment. My mom looks mortified in the front row, her hands covering her mouth. David's family looks confused and uncomfortable. That's when Pastor Williams completely loses it. He starts laughing so hard he's doubled over, tears streaming down his face, shoulder shaking uncontrollably. The sound echoes through the church. Nathan looks confused, his confidence wavering for the first time. What's so funny? This is serious. I'm trying to save her from making a mistake. Pastor Williams catches his breath, wiping his eyes with his handkerchief. Son, are you talking about my daughter? Audrey Nathan nods confidently, puffing out

When I was pregnant, my boyfriend Jake and I had the typical fights about baby names. He wanted something trendy like Harper or Paisley. I kept pushing for Margaret. He'd roll his eyes every time I brought it up and say stuff like, babe, that's such an old lady name. Or do you want our kid to get bullied? But here's the thing. Jake didn't know Margaret wasn't random to me. It was my grandmother's name and she basically raised me when my mom was too busy getting high to take care of a kid. Margaret taught me how to tie my shoes, helped with homework, made me grilled cheese when I was sick. She was the only stable thing in my whole chaotic childhood. Jake never met her because she passed away two years before we started dating. I tried explaining the connection once, but he just brushed it off and said, well, can't we honor her with the middle name instead? I dropped it because fighting while pregnant seemed pointless. So when our daughter was born and the nurse asked for the name, I looks Jake dead in the eyes and said, Margaret Rose. He literally went pale. The nurse was writing it down before he could even process what happened. Are you serious right now, he whispered. I just shrugged and said, I told you I liked it. For weeks after, people kept giving me these looks when I'd introduce Baby Margaret. My sister flat out asked if I was trying to make my kids life harder. Even the pediatrician seemed confused when he called out Margaret in the waiting room and a tiny baby showed up. But then something weird happened. When Margaret was about 6 months old, we were at the grocery store and this elderly woman behind us in line heard me talking to her. She got this huge smile and said, oh, my goodness, Mark, that was my best friend's name growing up. Such a beautiful, strong name. Then when Margaret started daycare, her teacher, Mrs. Chen, told me it was refreshing to see a classic name. Apparently she was getting tired of having three Aydens and four Madisons in every class. The real kicker came when Margaret turned 2. We were at a family barbecue and my great aunt pulled me aside. She said, you know, your grandmother would be so proud you named your daughter after her. I was confused because I'd never told anyone the real reason.

So I introduced her to someone who ruined her life. I was given a built in boyfriend thief when my younger sister Ashley was born. And I'm not talking about borrowed hoodies or flirty glances. I mean it. Like if I brought home a boyfriend, she'd have him in her bed within a month. If I introduced someone at dinner, she'd already be texting him under the table. If I posted an anniversary photo, she'd somehow end up accidentally running into him at his gym. People said she got Mom's looks and I got Dad's personality. It started very small, almost innocent. Even like when my high school boyfriend suddenly wanted to study at our house all the time, Ashley would walk by in towels asking him for homework help. I didn't see it then since I trusted them both. But by the time we hit our 20s, it got calculated. I dated Shane for six months before introducing him to my family. One week after that dinner, Ashley had a crisis and needed his shoulder to cry on at 2:00am. They slept together that night. Next came Julio from my accounting firm. The pattern repeated, family dinner, sudden emergency, midnight comfort. When I confronted her after finding their texts, she tilted her head and smiled. I'm just making sure they're good enough for you. Julio failed the test. And honestly, I agreed if they would leave me for my sister, they Weren't the right one for me. Then came Seth, who I dated for two years. We talk about getting married after I finished my teaching degree. Ashley got too drunk at the birthday party I'd thrown him and kissed him in front of everyone. When he chose her, she posted, sometimes you can't help who you fall for. Sorry, not sorry. Mom pulled me aside at Thanksgiving, voice sharp. You need to stop bringing these men around. Ashley can't control herself when you parade them in front of her. Why do you keep tempting her? In my head, I hadn't tempted anyone. Three months later, I met Adam at a friend's wedding down in Portland. He was everything and successful and apparently loyal. For eight months, I kept him completely secret. We dated in different towns, avoided social media and told absolutely no one. I thought I'd finally won because this was the best, best relationship I had ever been in until my cousin accidentally mentioned him to mom who mentioned him to Ashley. She found him within days through his company website. I walked into his apartment with the key he'd given me and found them together in our bed. But the worst part came when Ashley sat up still naked and said, I did you a favor. He barely lasted 10 minutes. You deserve better, sis. Adam just shrugged, your sister is way too hot for me not to try. I stood there shaking while she gathered her Clothes, kissing him goodbye like I wasn't even there. That's when I decided to give Ashley exactly what she craved. Man she couldn't resist but definitely should. I spent weeks searching through court records and police databases. That's how I found Wayne, a gorgeous, charming man who claimed to be a venture capitalist from Boston, recently divorced after his ex wife documented years of financial and physical abuse. Two restraining orders from other exes. Under investigation for fraud, court documents showed he'd hidden assets, forged signatures and manipulated multiple women into debt. Perfect. I created a fake LinkedIn profile as a potential investor and reached out to him. We met for business Coffee where I mentioned my beautiful sister who always stole my boyfriend's and showed him her Instagram, said that I could never find love. His eyes lit up at the ability to control me because no one gave me a chance. Very quickly, things progressed and I told him I was trying to keep my new relationship secret from her and invited him as my date to Mom's birthday dinner. Knowing exactly what would happen. He thought he was playing me and I would be his next new victim. And at first he played it.

So my daughter Emma is 15 and has been dating this kid, Noah, for about four months now. Every time they go out, Noah pays movies, dinner, ice cream, even when Emma wants to grab something from the gas station. At first I figured, whatever, teenage boys like to show off. But then I started hearing conversations between Emma and my wife where my wife would literally say things like, oh, honey, that's so sweet. He's such a gentleman and you should never have to pay when you're with a boy. Last week was when it really hit me. Emma comes home talking about how Noah spent 40 bucks taking her to some fancy burger place downtown. I asked her if she offered to split it. And she looked at me like I had three heads. She goes, dad, why would I do that? Mom says boys are supposed to pay for dates. I confronted my wife about it that night and she got all defensive, started going on about how it's traditional and romantic and how Noah's family has money anyway, so it's fine. I told her she's basically teaching our daughter to be a gold digger. And that shut down the conversation real quick. But it kept happening. Emma would come home bragging about expensive stuff Noah bought her a new phone case. Some jewelry, taking her to the movies every weekend. The kid was probably spending his entire part time job paycheck on my daughter. Things got really bad when Emma mentioned wanting to go to homecoming. She starts talking about the dress she wants, which costs like $200, casually mentions that Noah said he'd buy it for her along with paying for dinner in the limo. I asked her how much all of that would cost and she just shrugged and said, I don't know. That's Noah's problem. That's when I lost it. I sat both Emma and my wife down and told them this had to stop. I explained that Noah is a 16 year old kid working at a grocery store making minimum wage, not some sugar daddy. Emma got all upset and said I was being mean and that all her friends, boyfriends pay for everything, too. My wife backed her up saying I was being old fashioned and that it's normal for boys to want to spoil their girlfriends. I told them both they were living in fantasy land and that Emma needed to start contributing to dates or I'd have a conversation with Noah's parents about what was happening. The whole thing came to a head when Noah's mom called me last week. Turns out the poor kid had been stressed about money and finally told his parents he was spending everything he earned on Emma. His mom was really nice about it, but.

My husband always said he'd do anything to become a father, but I never imagined anything including my younger sister. We've been trying for three years. Every negative test felt like a tiny funeral while Mark sat beside me scrolling adoption sites like shopping online, sighing louder with each click. When my sister Emma offered to be our surrogate at Thanksgiving, I thought we caught a break. She'd already had two kids. I do anything for you, she said, squeezing my hand. Family helps family. I watched Mark's eyes meet hers across the table. That should have been my first warning. The fertility clinic quoted us $30,000 for IVF with surrogacy. Mark started a spreadsheet, calculating interest rates, loan options and even selling his motorcycle. Then one night over Chinese takeout, he sat down his chopsticks and said, what if we did it the traditional way? I laughed. What do you mean traditional? He leaned forward, completely serious. We skip the IVF. I just plant my seed directly in Emma. No medical costs, no procedures, same result. My chopsticks clattered to the table. He kept going, launching into this whole speech about efficiency and saving money, how people did it for centuries, how it would be clinical and quick, just a medical procedure without the medical bills. He said, I couldn't speak. I was too busy trying to process that my husband Had just asked to bang my sister. The guilt trip started immediately. I guess you don't really want kids. Other wives would understand the sacrifice. He even compared me to his coworker Janet, who'd done egg donation for her sister. Each comment was designed to make me feel selfish for saying no. By Week 3, Emma called me. Mark explained everything, she said, voice dripping with concern. I want you to know I'm open to it, whatever helps you become a mom. She went on about how it would be beautiful creating life for her sister and how the baby would be loved by everyone. I thanked her but said I wasn't sure yet and hung up. Then came the Thursday that changed everything. Mark was at his brother's bachelor party and I needed our insurance card for a dentist appointment. I searched his home office, rifling through his file filling cabinet and behind the tax returns, I found a Manila folder labeled medical. Inside were test results from two years before we married. Male factor infertility. Sperm count 0, completely sterile. My hands shook reading the urologist notes. Genital irreversible, no surgical options. He'd known every fertility appointment where he'd held my hand while doctors explained how my body was failing us every time I sobbed over negative tests. He knew he was the problem. I kept digging and opened his computer to see what else he might be hiding and saw text with my sister going back six Months. They talked about how once I agreed to the surrogacy, they wouldn't have to sneak around anymore, how this was really going to work and how they'd finally have a daughter of their own and make leaving me easy. They were actually joking about how simple their plan was. Emma wrote, she'll probably thank us for taking the burden off her. With a laughing emoji. Mark replied that they'd tell our families the baby needed her biological mom, that the child couldn't bond with me properly. We'll look like we're doing what's best for the baby. He'd written, for stealing my life one text at a time. I could have left right then and there and dodged the biggest bullet of a lifetime, but what's the fun in that? So I called the one person he despised most, his older brother, Ryan, Harvard MBA investment banker. Daddy's favorite market's been our entire marriage. Making snide comments about Mister Perfect and trying to one up every story about Ryan's success. I laid it all out to Ryan, who just said, Jesus. Even for Mark, that's evil. When I told him I had an idea but needed his help, he didn't even hesitate. Whatever you're thinking, I'm in. From then on, I started acting defeated. I told Mark over breakfast, you're right, we should be practical about this. His whole face lit up like his plan was finally working. Later that same night, I asked Mark to meet me at home. For an important conversation. When he arrived, I was sitting calmly on the couch. I've been thinking about your suggestion about doing things tradition, I said. Mark leaned forward eagerly and, well, I found someone. We've already started trying. His face went white. What do you mean trying? You're infertile. Who? Oh, didn't I mention? Turns out I'm perfectly fertile. Just needed someone with working equipment. Called upstairs. You can come down now. Ryan walked down, adjusting his tie. Hey, little brother, thanks for the practical suggestion. I pulled out his fertility report and laid it out for him. Why are you upset? You're sterile. You've always been sterile. I held up my phone. Oh, and I just sent Emma your fertility report. All those promises about babies, she's finding out right now that you can't deliver. His jaw dropped as his phone started buzzing frantically. Came at me and said, you ruined my life. But Ryan was already dragging him toward the door. I filed for divorce the next morning and it was finalized after six months. Emma dumped him the moment she found out he was sterile and Mark lost everything. I'm focusing on myself now and honestly, I've never been happier. But I still think about Mark lying awake at night, wondering if his perfect brother really did screw his wife and when I might be expecting his brother's baby. I hope the thought eats him alive.

I'm not usually the type to clap back on social media. I'm the neighbor who brings cookies to new move ins and returns lost packages that Amazon drops at the wrong house. But everyone has a breaking point. And mine came at 1:00am on a Thursday when some jackass decided to celebrate America with fireworks while the rest of us were trying to sleep. I love fireworks on the fourth of July, New Year's Eve, hell even random Saturdays and summer. But Thursday at 1:00am when I had to drive two hours for an 8:00am meeting? That's just being an asshole. My dogs went ballistic, I went from dead sleep to fighter flight mode, and my alarm was set for 4:00am. So yeah, I was pissed. After my meeting. Exhausted and running on gas station coffee. I posted in our neighborhood Facebook group to whoever set off fireworks at 1:00am. Some of us have jobs. There's a time and place. Thursday morning. Isn't it simple enough? Right? I wasn't even that harsh. Then this guy, let's call him Brad because he looks like every Brad who peaked in high school. Commented maybe you can't sleep because you're a fat pig. Just like that. No context, no reason, just pure cruelty from a stranger. His profile showed a guy in his late 30s with a wife, two kids, and a bio about family. Values the kind of guy who posts Bible verses on Sunday and your body, my choice memes on Monday. Here's the thing. I just lost 50 pounds. I was feeling better than I had in years, finally comfortable in my own skin, and this random douchebag decided to take a shot at me for no reason. He didn't even set off the fireworks, which I found out later were from teenagers three blocks over. He just saw an opportunity to be cruel and took it. The comment sat there getting laugh reacts from his buddies while I stared at it during my drive home. That's when something shifted. I could have reported it, blocked him, been the bigger person. Instead, I clicked on his profile. Brad Williams, married to Karen Williams for 12 years. Tons of couple photos, anniversary posts, whole blessed wife performance. Then I had an idea that would either be genius or get me blocked from the group. But after being called a fat pig in front of 500 neighbors, I was ready to risk it. I typed my response carefully, making sure to use his first name. Listen, Brad, I'm sorry I had to end things between us, but I just didn't have the same feelings. What you're saying now is hurtful. Please stop messaging me and commenting on my posts. I told you a dozen times already, we're done. It's over. And I immediately left for a cruise I booked months ago. Seven and days No internet, no cell service. Just me and my best friend drinking overpriced margaritas and forgetting Brad Williams existed. I figured worst case, I'd come back to being kicked out of the group. Best case, his wife would see it, and he'd have some explaining to do. I didn't expect what actually happened. When I finally got Wi-Fi again in Cosamel, my phone exploded. 47 Facebook messages, 23 friend requests, 186 notifications. My cousin had texted, girl, what did you do? 17 times I opened Facebook to find my inbox flooded. Karen Williams had sent 12 increasingly frantic messages asking for details about my relationship with her husband. Brad had sent several, calling me a lying bitch and threatening legal action. But the real treasure was a message from someone named Jessica saying she was also sleeping with Brad and thought she was the only mistress. Apparently, my comment had lit a fuse. Karen saw it within an hour, confronted Brad, and in his panic to deny knowing me, he'd accidentally revealed he had a secret Instagram account. Karen found that account, which LED to finding Jessica, which LED to finding out about someone named Ashley, and the whole house of cards came tumbling down. By day three of my cruise, two more women had come forward. Brad's little fat pig comment had started an avalanche that revealed four affairs spanning six years. Neighborhood Facebook group was better than Reality TV. Karen posted a photo of Brad's stuff in garbage. Bags on the lawn. Jessica showed up at their house demanding answers. Ashley leaked his nudes to the group before admin could delete them. Brad kept making new accounts to defend himself, each one getting blocked faster than the last final post before disappearing completely. That fat bitch ruined my life with her lies. Last I heard, Karen divorced him and Brad's living in his brother's basement. And I only know this because Karen told me everything herself when she invited me to her girls night. Sip and paint. She sent the message, you have to come, fatty. With a crying laughing emoji. We had an awesome time painting wine bottles and sharing Brad's most embarrassing bedroom secrets. I'm down 54 pounds and sleep like a baby now. Turns out I wasn't the pig after all.

Now he's trapped in his own mess. I was adopted and my foster parents treated me like their own kid and their kids treated me like their sibling, except for Chad. Chad was an insensitive a hole to everyone. He would fight our older sister, say horrible things to everyone. And his anger issues caused him to break doors and punch holes in walls. The worst thing was when he got up in front of our whole class year and told them I wasn't his sister and never would be. He claimed I would never be a part of his family and I should stop trying. He would keep doing this up until he moved out and I stopped talking to him. I have stayed as far away from him as possible, only seeing him for family pictures every year because our mother asks. Recently he got married and had a baby and everyone was congratulating him except for me. Our mom noticed and asked why I was distancing myself from him. I told her about high school and she said this is still my kid and it's my first grandbaby. And it was the reason she wasn't going to be upset over it. I knew that would happen. Out of nowhere, I got a message from Chad begging me to go babysit for Them because you're the only one who can deal with these kinds of babies because no one will help. He knows I have insomnia and that's why I don't mind staying up. I can't tell if that's a blessing or a curse at this point. For some reason, I accepted and went over at eight PM when I showed up, I was greeted by Chad's wife who had the biggest eye bags but still greeted me with a smile. She explained the baby's night route feedings and said they would be home around 12:30 at most. After this, Chad showed up, looked at me for over a minute and gave me a small wave, then left the house. His wife followed and told me to call or text if I needed anything. For a minute, I was just stunned but went to take care of the baby. He was fine the whole time. And then twelve thirty PM rolled around, but they weren't home. I decided to wait and then ended up texting them at one asking where they were. I got no reply from either of them. They finally showed up at 3 in the morning. I'm livid at this point. I walked into the living room and told them I was waiting for their response. Chad's wife said, oh, Chad said it was fine and that it would only be an hour more. I cut her off to say, it's fine, whatever, the baby's sleeping. I thought I Could walk out of there with my head held high. But when I walked past Chad, I blurted out, so you aren't going to say anything to me after I looked after your kid for seven hours? He snorted at me and was like, no, my wife is the one who talked me into this. Pissed off, I said, so this wasn't a way to apologize for high school or all those other times you outcast me from the family because I was under the impression that you'd want to patch things up? He snapped back, why should I apologize? Nothing from high school has changed. You really do need to just grow up and understand that me and my wife aren't going to cater to you like mom and dad did because you're adopted. You ain't our family and you won't ever be. I turned to his wife and told her she married a disgusting piece of crap and if he continues to act this way, his son will grow up to hate him, too. One day she'll resent him for what he is and she'll only have herself to blame. Chad got angry and said, I had no right to talk to her like that when not even my real family wanted me. I reminded him that his wife also has an adopted sister, told her that if this was the way he spoke about me, then what did she think he was saying about her sister? He Surely wasn't treating her like a princess. I could see that I was getting through to her. But then Chad punched a wall. Classic Chad. I screamed not out of fear, but because I wanted to wake the baby up out of pure spitefulness. Right on cue, we could hear him crying and Chad and his wife audibly groaned. Chad then asked me to go take care of the baby so he and his wife could go to sleep. I told him like hell and gave him the middle finger before leaving and slamming the door. From another relative, I heard that they had a big argument and his wife is currently staying with her parents. Her parents also had a change of heart towards him. Now he's claiming that I made him say that on purpose, which is ridiculous. I smell a divorce in the future.

She had cameras in every room of the house and asked me to call her every half hour just to make sure her daughter was okay. She told me I wasn't allowed to do anything except watch her. And when she finally left, I basically just sat there for three hours doing nothing until she came home. She came back and basically ran into the room to make sure the girl was okay and I assured her everything was fine. I had long hair at the time and had put it up at this point.

This made her furious and a second later, I felt her grab my head. All I remember was feeling the worst pain I've ever felt in my ear. I turned around to see her holding my hearing aid and realized what she did. She thought I was listening to music, so she ripped my hearing Aid out of my ear thinking it was a headphone. And since they connect directly to my eardrum, she completely ripped that out, too. The pain was so intense I passed out and woke up in the hospital to my mom crying. She was livid. And even though they begged us not to, we sued her. I will never hear out of my ear again, but I'll never have to work again either.

What did you consider intimate? I didn't know families hugged until I was 19. In my house, we lived like roommates who hated each other. Nobody talked, nobody touched. Nobody said I love you, ever. When I cried, I did it alone. When I got sick, my mom left medicine on the counter and walked away. I thought this was normal. Then I met a family that broke me. My college roommate, Kara, invited me home for Thanksgiving. I typed three different excuses before deleting them. She'd been trying to be my friend since September. When I told my parents, they only asked what time I'd be back Sunday, nothing else. But Kara kept insisting. Her mom already bought extra food. I had no good reason to say no. Walking into Kara's house, I had no idea I was about to discover what I've been missing my entire life. Her mom hugged me at the door. Not a quick pat, a real hug. Three full seconds. My whole body went rigid, like she was attacking me. I didn't know where to put my hands, so I just stood there with my arms pinned to my sides like an idiot. At dinner, they went around the table sharing their days on purpose, like they actually wanted to hear each other talk. When Kara's brother said he failed his history test, I literally braced myself for the uncomfortable silence. Instead, his dad put down his fork. And said, man, that sucks. Tell me what happened. And then they all just. He listened to him. The whole family stopped eating to help him feel better. I sat there confused, waiting for someone to tell him to try harder or stop whining. Nobody did. When Kara's mom burned the rolls, he laughed about it, got distracted thinking about dessert. Everyone started teasing her, and she laughed even harder. I kept waiting for someone to storm off or slam something at my house. Burning food meant my dad would eat in his car and my mom would bang cabinets. For a week, these people were laughing. Then I noticed something that made my chest feel weird. Kara's hand on her mom's shoulder. Her dad ruffling her brother's hair. Everyone piling on one couch even though there were other seats. I pressed myself against the armrest, trying not to accidentally touch anyone, because in my house, physical contact meant someone was either really angry or someone died. After dinner, Kara and her mom were doing dishes, just chatting, and her mom said, I'm proud of how you handled Professor Williams. Kara hadn't even brought it up. Her mom just knew about it and cared. My throat got tight watching them. The next morning, Kara walked in and announced she was anxious about her paper. Her dad literally stopped making coffee to listen to her talk about her feelings for 15 minutes straight. He helped her make a plan. Nobody told Her. She was being dramatic. I sat there with my cereal getting soggy because I couldn't process what I was watching. But that night destroyed me completely. Through the walls, I heard them saying, good night. Love you, mom. Love you, too, sweetheart. Night, dad. Love you. Love you more, kiddo. Every single night. Like breathing. I laid there shaking, trying to remember one time my parents said those words. Nothing. These people said, I love you every day. And my family couldn't even say good job. I never told Kara about my family. When her mom asked about our Thanksgiving traditions twice, I changed the subject. Both times, my hands were literally shaking. She stopped asking, but squeezed my shoulder. When I sat back down, I almost lost it right there. At breakfast on my last morning, Kara's dad asked if my parents minded me being gone for the holiday. Said they were fine with it. And he exchanged this look with Kara's mom. Not a mean look. More like they were figuring something out about me that I didn't want them to know. When Kara's mom drove me to the bus station, she turned the radio down halfway there. Listen, honey, you're welcome here anytime. Any holiday, any weekend. Or just because. I stared at my hands because I knew if I looked at her, I'd start crying. Before I got out, she hugged me way longer than necessary. When she pulled back, her eyes were watery. You Deserve to be loved, sweetheart. I hope you know that. I literally couldn't speak. Nobody had ever said that to me before. That visit broke me open. I started small. Asked friends how they were and actually listened. Said thank you and meant it. Called the campus counseling center. Hung up twice before booking. Three months later, I told someone I love you for the first time. They said it back. And I didn't die.

I didn't know guys will just stand in the shower for 10 minutes doing nothing, no water running, just standing there like they're waiting for a download to finish. The first time I walked in on it, I thought something was wrong. He looked at me all calm and said, I'm just mentally preparing. I've never looked at showers the same way. 2. I found out men treat fridges like treasure hunts. He'll open it five times in a row, stare like something new is going to spawn, sigh dramatically, and then eat plain cheese straight from the block. I once asked why he keeps checking. He said, in case a snack magically appears. Three, I didn't know guys hum to themselves during the most random tasks. My boyfriend will be cleaning the sink, humming what sounds like boss battle music, then suddenly switch to singing about how this sponge is my sword. I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said, but it still smells like me, so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said, because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6, 10. They make sound effects for everything, opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7, they'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8, they'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes. And apparently that's normal to them. 9, they'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car, groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10, they can sit in total silence for an hour staring at the wall. And when you ask what they're thinking about, they say nothing. And somehow they really mean nothing.

And then when the one time I send him a video, he gives me a skull emoji and wilted flower after just 10 seconds, but the video is two minutes long. How the fuck is he doing that? Is he watching on 10 x fucking speed? Or maybe he's hiding the fact that he is flash or something. And then bro starts actually tweaking if I don't keep our streak going. Like, bro, I'm sorry if I don't live on fucking TikTok, can you please stop sending me so many videos? I use TikTok to watch the videos on my for you page, not the videos that you send me. Send this to your friend and see if they watch this whole video. Top Hat man. 32 out.

So I moved across the country for my dream job. But six months later, she showed up at my door saying, I'm ready to commit now, because distance doesn't matter when it's real love. And I laughed before introducing her to my new fiance, who was cooking dinner in our kitchen. I'm Marcus, 26, and when Jess dumped me six months ago, she said I was emotionally unavailable and socially stunted. Her exact words. You hide behind your work and can't form real connections. I need someone who actually has friends and knows how to be vulnerable. This happened right after I got accepted to my dream veterinary residency in Denver. We've been together two years, and I thought we were solid. I was planning to propose that Christmas, even had the ring picked out. The breakup destroyed me. I spent three days eating cereal in bed, questioning everything. Was I really that disconnected? Maybe she was right. Maybe I was just using her as a placeholder while focusing on my career. But I'd committed to the residency. So I packed up and drove to Denver with just my clothes, textbook, and a broken heart. If I was going to be miserable, at least I'd do something I loved. The animal hospital was this busy emergency clinic downtown. Doctor Peterson put me on 12 hour shifts. Immediately, I was so exhausted learning new procedures that I barely thought about Jess. Something unexpected happened, though. My colleague Mike kept inviting me to trivia night. At this, I made excuses. Too tired, had studying. But Mike was persistent, and I finally gave in just to shut him up. Trivia night was actually fun. Mike's team called themselves the Possum 4 and competed against other medical professionals. I was weirdly good at Animal Facts, making me valuable for the first time in months. I was laughing and genuinely enjoying people's company. Mike introduced me to his hiking group. Outdoorsy medical people doing weekend trails around Colorado. I'd always loved nature, but never had anyone to explore with. Suddenly, I was spending Saturdays climbing mountains and having real conversations with people who weren't. Just then I started volunteering at the city animal shelter on days off. They needed someone with medical training for health assessments. That's where I met Diana. She was the shelter coordinator, this amazing woman who knew every single animal's personality and history. She'd work late with difficult rescue cases, and I started staying to help with medical checkups. We'd talk for hours about each animal's progress and recovery stories. Diana had this gift for seeing potential in every broken creature. She was patient, compassionate, incredibly smart about animal behavior. Three months later, we went on our first date to a dog friendly brewery where half our shelter animals had been adopted. We spent the evening pointing Out our kids and discussing dreams of opening our own rescue. Focused practice with Diana. Conversation felt effortless. We could talk about work, family, random thoughts. Everything flowed naturally. I'd never experienced that easy connection, even with Jess. Diana actually listened when I talked about cases. Last month, I proposed

Aria was the girl who'd throw any girl under the bus for five seconds of male approval. Since freshman year, everyone knew Aria as the girl who'd loudly announced she only hung out with guys because girls are too much drama. She'd sit at the guys table, laugh at every sexist joke louder than anyone else and somehow convinced herself that calling other girls too sensitive made her special. The crazy part was the guys ate it up. Even teachers thought Aria was refreshingly laid back compared to other girls. I remember this one time in P E. When a girl complained about the boys snapping girls bra straps. Aria actually stood up and said, it's just guys being guys. Stop being such a baby about it. The male coach literally thanked her for being rational. That was Aria's whole thing. She was the cool girl who got it. She'd brag about watching porn with the guys, rate other girls bodies with them and called feminism victim mentality. Girls who tried to call out inappropriate behavior became her targets. He'd mock them with fake crying sounds, post their complaints on social media to ridicule them and loudly proclaim how she wasn't like those uptight bitches who couldn't take a joke. During junior year when Natalie recorded getting groped at a party, Aria was the first to say Natalie was probably asking for it wearing that dress. Guys would high five her. Call her basically a dude with tits and she'd beam like she'd won the lottery. When we all came back on Monday after spring break of senior year, we were preparing for the moment Aria went off on a girl and snickered with one of her guy friends. But first period arrives and Aria walks past the guys table without even glancing at them. Not like avoiding them. Aria just walked past like they didn't exist. She sits down at a table full of girls, the same girls she'd spent three years mocking. Vivian, who she'd called a dramatic princess. Audrey, who she labeled attention seeking for reporting harassment. Natalie, whose reputation she tried to destroy. The guys started calling her over. Yo, Aria, we saved your spot. She didn't even turn her head. It was like she'd gone deaf to male voices. At first, everyone thought it was some weird joke. Maybe she lost a bet over spring break. Maybe this was some elaborate prank that would turn into the ultimate pick me moment. We were on the edge of our seats waiting for her to burst out yelling, I was right, girls are too much drama. But Aria kept sitting with the girls. She stopped responding to the guys texts, unfollowed all of them on every platform. When Ethan tried to talk to her after chemistry, she looked right through him and kept walking. Days turned into weeks. Guys went from confused to angry. They started spreading rumors. That Aria was on her period, that she turned into a crazy feminist overnight, that she was probably a lesbian now. They tried everything to get a reaction. Nothing. Aria just kept sitting with the girls, actually listening when they talked, not interrupting to defend male behavior. The girls were suspicious at first. This had to be some long con to gather gossip for the boys. But Aria never brought up the guys, never defended them. When Jade mentioned feeling uncomfortable about something her boyfriend said, Aria actually responded with, that's not okay. You deserve better. Everyone's jaws broke the floor. Then we all found out what happened. It was so much worse than anyone imagined. Audrey revealed what she'd heard from her older brother, who went to college with Ethan's brother. During spring break, there'd been a huge party at Ethan's house while his parents were gone. Yeah, had gone, got drunk and crashed in the guest room. The next morning, she'd woken up early and went to find her phone. Ethan's laptop was open on the kitchen counter, and the screen was on a group chat. A group chat with every single guy she hung out with, plus dozens from other schools. The chat was called the Spank Bank. Arya had scrolled up.

When Tom told me Linda was gone, I thought we'd finally have peace. Those kids, Emma and Jake, had been living with us every other weekend since we got married. But now they were ours full time. And honestly, I was excited. I've been buying them school supplies, taking them to soccer practice, helping with homework while their mom barely showed up to games. The funeral was weird. Tom cried more than I'd seen in our whole relationship. Emma kept asking when mom was coming back, and Jake just sat there staring. I held their hands during the service, thinking about how we'd need bunk beds and a bigger car. Two days later, Tom got a call from Linda's lawyer. She'd left everything to Tom and her will. The house, her savings, her car, even custody. But here's the thing nobody expected. She also left a letter explaining why. Tom read it out loud while the kids were at school. I know I wasn't the best mom. I know you guys gave them to. Really, I couldn't. But I need them to understand something about their real father. My stomach dropped. Real father? Tom went white as paper. Turns out, Linda had been lying for six years. Tom wasn't Emma and Jake's biological dad. Some guy named Ryan from her college was. He'd been getting child support from Tom. This Whole time knowing he wasn't their father. The letter had DNA test results tucked inside, proving everything. Tom just sat there holding the papers, not saying anything. I asked if he was okay, and he said, I don't know what I am anymore. The kids came home an hour later asking about dinner. Like nothing had changed that night. Tom couldn't sleep. He kept saying, they're not mine. I've been raising someone else's kids.

My brother's boss disagreed. I walk into the restaurant holding my eight year old daughter's hand and she's never met these people. My family cut me off when I got pregnant at 17, called me a disappointment and slammed the door in my face. Eight years later, they finally agreed to meet us. My mother looks me up and down. Oh, honey, at least you tried to look nice. I'm wearing my favourite sundress, but apparently it's not enough. She hugs my daughter like she has the right. She's so well behaved despite everything. Despite everything. Like my daughter's existence is something to forcome. My sister asks if I need money for school clothes. My father won't even look at me directly. They picked this specific restaurant because it's affordable, which means they think I'm broke. My mother actually says, don't worry, sweetie, we ordered water for the table. We know being a single mom is hard. The server keeps glancing at me nervously, but I shake my head at her. My brother slides a 20 across the table for gas money home like I'm still 17, borrowing the family car. My mother asks if I ever finished high school. When I say I graduated college, she, those, oh, online degrees count too, honey. Then my brother stands up all proud. I have an announcement. I just got hired as restaurant manager at this very chain. Everyone's clapping and my mother says, See, your brother didn't ruin his life and look where he is now. My brother's bragging. I'm one of only four managers in the whole district. I report directly to regional. I'm making 60,000 a year. My father finally speaks to me. Maybe your brother can get you a job here. They're always hiring servers. My mother asks where the father of my daughter is. And I say, he left. Of course he did. What did you expect from having a baby so young? My sister shows photos from her Paris vacation last summer and tells me, maybe someday you can take your daughter somewhere nice. At one point, I managed to get out that I work in the restaurant industry. However, they keep assuming I mean waitressing. My mother tells another table very loudly, my daughter had so much potential, got pregnant at 17. We tried to help, but she wouldn't listen. My daughter asks why. Grandma seems angry. And I tell her Grandma's just confused. My brother is still going on about his promotion. The owner is supposed to stop by today, actually doing rounds at all the locations. The server is getting more nervous, hovering nearby. But I'm waiting. My family keeps talking about how hard being a single mother must be, how I probably can't afford daycare, how my daughter probably doesn't have a college fund. Such a shame, my mother says. She was so smart before she threw it all away. My daughter squeezes my Hand under the table. She knows something they don't. The manager approaches our table and my brother jumps up. This is my.

I giggled nervously. Um, yeah. Why? No, no, no, no, no. She suddenly screamed while walking as far away from me as possible. I just laughed because moms can be so weird sometimes. But the next day, my daughter came home from school crying, Mommy! Leah said her mom said she can't talk to me anymore. Leah was her best friend. I immediately took out my phone and texted her mom, asking if everything was okay. No response. I texted Emily's mom, one of the other girls in her trio. Still nothing. I had just managed to calm my baby girl down when the pizza arrived. Usually our delivery guy is the apator 5,000. But tonight he just set the box on my doorstep and practically ran away. George, you forgot your tip! I yelled, waving a 20. He just kept going. The next few days were insane. At my daughter's soccer practice, Helen saw me walking towards her and held her phone to her ear. No one had even called her, Helen, what's going on? She mouth sorry and walked faster. We used to complain about our husbands together. Parents were whispering and showing each other something on their phones. When I walked by, they quickly put them away. By Thursday, my daughter was refusing to go to school. They moved my desk away from everyone else. The teacher, Said it was for space reasons, but there's like ten feet between me and Leah now. I tried to bring her to the hairdresser to cheer her up, but when the woman saw me coming, she closed early. No apology. Just flipped the sign and pulled the blinds. My phone buzzed. It was my landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry. Rent can wait this month. This was the same man who charged me a fifty dollar inconvenience fee when I paid rent at 12:00am instead of midnight. Then the birthday party. Emily's sleepover. My daughter found out that everyone was invited except her. She was having such a bad panic attack that I had to call a hospital. Mom, what did I do? Emily is my best friend. Enough was enough. I called the school office. Something is happening to my daughter. She's being systematically excluded and I need answers right now. The counselor called back within an hour, but her voice was off, like she was choosing every word carefully. Mrs. Callahan, we just wanted to check in about your home environment. Is everything safe? If anyone new spending time around your daughter? What? What are you even asking me? I think it's best if we discuss this in person. Can you come in tomorrow morning? No. You'll tell me right now why my daughter is being tortured. Long pause. The principal will explain everything tomorrow. Beep. She hung up. Then at eleven PM, an email from my gym Membership terminated effective immediately. I've been going there for five years. The owner knew me by name. I was trying to figure out what to do when my daughter crawled into my bed at 2:00am, sobbing, Mommy, am I ugly? It took everything in me not to burst into tears. The lunch lady wouldn't look at me today. She just pointed at my tray. I finally caved. On Saturday morning, I found myself walking towards the principal's office while being escorted by a security guard. Other parents there for Saturday sports hold their kids against the walls as we passed. One mom literally shielded her son with her body, like we were dangerous. In his office, the principal locked the door behind us. The click was so loud in the silence. He walked to the windows and twisted the blinds shut. My daughter grabbed my hand tighter. Please sit down. I'll stand. What is this about? He sat at his desk, fingers hovering over his keyboard, then pulled them back. Mister Griffin, you're scaring me. Missus Callahan. He was looking at his screen, not at me.

One Friday night, Adam crashed his car into a tree. The er doctor told us his kidney was damaged. Not destroyed, but damaged. He might need dialysis in a few years instead of decades. My mom looked at me in the hospital waiting room and asked the question that made everything click. Would you consider donating your other kidney when he needs it? My dad nodded like this made perfect sense, like I was born to be Adam's personal organ donor. Like that was my only purpose in their lives. I stared at them for a long time. Then I asked. Asked if they'd even checked on how I was feeling after my surgery. My mom looked confused. You're fine now, she said. You recovered. I asked if they remembered that I missed my eighth grade graduation because I was too weak to walk across the stage. They didn't remember. I asked if they knew I still couldn't run without getting dizzy. They didn't know. I asked if they would have had another baby. If that baby. To give Adam kidneys, too. The silence told me everything. I Moved in with my grandma that night, packed one bag and left. My parents called once to ask when I was coming home. I told them I already was home.

Mr Gonzales, what? What's happening? Is someone hurt? I tried to pull my arm free, but his grip was iron tight. I don't think I'm qualified for whatever. You're the only one who raised their hand. He cut me off. That makes you qualified. Outside, his car was already running with the doors open. She said she had until Thursday. He kept muttering while speeding out of the school parking lot. The midwife isn't answering her phone. I gripped the door handle, calculating if I could jump out at the next red light. Mister Gonzales, you're scaring me. I call my mom. No, he Swerved around a car and I slammed into the window. No one can know. Put your phone away. Turn it off. I'm not turning off my phone, I shouted, but I did anyway. We were going 50 in a 25 zone and Mr Gonzalez kept checking his mirrors like someone was following us. Finally, he pulled into a driveway of a small yellow house that definitely wasn't his. Listen to me. He grabbed my shoulders before we got out. They can't know she was here. Do you understand? No matter what happens, they can't know. I don't understand anything. I was practically yelling, now I'm 17. I don't even have my license yet. Marco. He used my name for the first time, his voice desperate. You've kept bigger secrets than this. I know your family. I need that same silence now. He wasn't wrong. I'd already seen two drive bys this year and never said a word to the cops. But this felt different. He shoved a pair of surgical gloves into my hands. Put these on. The front door was unlocked. Inside, we followed the sound of crying to a back bedroom where a woman was curled up on a bare mattress. She looked young, maybe early 20s, with long black hair stuck to her face with sweat. It's too early, she gasped in accented English when she saw us. Then she looked at me and started crying harder. He's just a child. You brought a child. I'm 17. I said, stupid, like that made any difference. I watch Grey's anatomy, if that helps. She switched to Spanish and started begging Mister Gonzales for something I couldn't understand. He pushed me toward her. Check how dilated she is. What? I backed up so fast I knocked over.

So I made sure he saw exactly how much I didn't need him. Uncle Wayne was worth millions but lived like a miser, constantly testing our family to see who was worthy of his money. Every holiday was an audition where cousins would compete for his approval like desperate contestants on a reality show. I'm leaving everything to whoever proves they don't need it, announce at family dinners while everyone kissed his ass and hung on his every word. My cousins would bring him expensive gifts they couldn't afford, offer to clean his house for free, practically beg for his attention and validation. They'd research his interests and pretend to share his hobbies. My cousin Kyle even switched his major to business because Uncle Wayne mentioned he respected entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, I brought nothing and sat in the corner reading a book, completely disinterested in his little power games. Grace doesn't seem to care about family, he'd say loud enough for me to hear. Testing to see if I'd scramble for his approval like the others. You're right, I'd reply without looking up from my book. I don't care about your money either. This always made him pause. While my cousins were falling over themselves to prove their worth, I was actively proving my indifference. While they fought over who could drive him to appointments and grocery shop for him, I got a second job and started Saving every penny. While they argued about his will, I was building my own future. When they'd ask why I never visited Uncle Wayne, I'd say, he has plenty of volunteers. I found his manipulation disgusting. Watching grown adults debase themselves for money made me sick. I'd rather be broke with dignity than rich through desperation. My cousins thought I was crazy. Don't you want financial security? Anna would ask. I'm setting myself up without begging, I tell her. While they spent their weekends doing his yard work and running his errands, I was working overtime and taking online courses to improve my skills. While they were buying him birthday presents and Christmas gifts, I was investing in my education and building an emergency fund. Dynamic was fascinating to watch. The more desperate they became for his approval, the more he seemed to enjoy withholding it. The more I ignored him, the more curious he became about me. At family gatherings, he'd try to bait me into conversations about money and success. I'd give polite, brief responses and go back to whatever I was doing. I wasn't rude, but I wasn't performing for him either. Grace, what are your career plans? He'd ask in front of everyone. Working on it, I'd say, simply not elaborating. This drove him crazy because he couldn't figure out my angle. Everyone else was transparent in their attempts to impress him, but I genuinely didn't seem to care about his opinion or his money. The.

Everyone told me that I put down a girl and that's wrong, but I don't care. I do it a million times if I had to. By 6th grade, I grew taller than everyone else, which was cool, but I was a bit overweight, which never helped. By 7th, I stood a foot over most girls and weighed more, too. I got loud when I was nervous. A girl named Kira liked that. She had shiny hair, a clean hoodie and a laugh that pulled people in. It's started in the cafeteria. I sat with two girls from band trying to eat slow. Kira slid by my table and tapped the corner of my mouth like I had crumbs. I wiped, found nothing. Then Jim. We ran laps while the teacher clicked a stopwatch. My legs burned. Kira paced me for one lap and leaned close. She whispered, eat less, then sprinted ahead like she'd broken a record. By winter, the group chat made it worse. Someone posted a picture of my back on the bus. The caption said, thickzilla takes homeroom. I muted my phone and shoved it into my bag. I knew more about Kira than she thought. In 6th grade, a girl from her street whispered a story. Police cars outside her house one night. Her dad dead, her mom arrested. I didn't trust it until I searched on my school Chromebook. A short article appeared with her Street name and a line about a family fight reading it felt like holding a secret I didn't want I closed the tab and told no one. I even tried to be kinder. I held doors for her said hi in the hall told myself her jokes came from pain if I stayed calm, maybe she'd get bored she didn't. She watched my plate at lunch and shook her head she filmed my mile time and posted it she called me big show when I walked past her friends Spirit week she told the cheer girls I stretched out the Pep rally shirt on the bus when we hit a pothole and I grabbed the rail she laughed and said the bus didn't stand a chance. In health class she asked if stretch marks meant someone let themselves go and a few kids glanced at me before looking away. I Learned to breathe through it. In my room, I jogged in place with the fan on thighs rubbing out a low sound. I saved that page like a scar the the day it broke started like any Tuesday. The gym smelled like body spray and old rubber. We'd run the mile outside and came in to change. Lockers clanked sneakers grape I peeled my shirt off silver stretch marks flashing across my hips and thighs from growing too fast I dug through my bag too long for my clean tea. Kira stood at the end of the bench with a Bottle of shimmer spray, she pointed at my skin. Her voice carried. Wow, look at those stretch marks. Maybe save some lunch money for lotion. Heads turned. A water bottle rolled off a bench and bumped the tile. Two cheer girls stifled laughs. The girl from math stared at the floor. Someone whispered, stop, but it was weak. My eyes stung. Heat climbed my neck. Then the fan in my head went quiet. For two years, I'd carried her secret like glass. I'd taken the stairs, the jokes, the photos. I'd given her chances to.

I was 12 when my brother Adam needed a kidney. And they looked at me like I was spare parts. Adam was 17, the golden child, captain of the basketball team, honor roll student. I was the quiet one who drew pictures and stayed in my room. When the doctors said Adam's kidneys were shutting down, my parents got tested first. Neither of them matched then. And they tested me, perfect match. The nurse smiled and said I could save my brother's life. My parents didn't even ask if I wanted to do it. They scheduled the surgery that same week. I was scared, but everyone kept saying I was a hero. My mom cried and said god made me Adam's little brother for a reason. The surgery went fine for Adam. He bounced back. In two weeks, back to school, back to basketball. But I had complications. My body was rejecting something the doctor said. I felt sick all the time, couldn't eat, lost 20 pounds. Adam got a welcome back party when he returned to school. Half the town showed up. My mom gave this big speech about how grateful she was that god saved her miracle baby. She never mentioned my name once. I sat in the corner eating cake that tasted like cardboard. I dropped out of school for a semester to recover. My parents acted like this was normal. Like, of course, I Would sacrifice my education for Adam's health. When people asked where I was, they said I was homeschooling by choice. Six months later, Adam started drinking, heavy drinking. He'd sneak out to part, please come home wasted, throw up in the bathroom. My parents found bottles in his room and just took them away quietly. They didn't want to stress his new kidney. One Friday night, Adam crashed his car into a tree. The er doctor told us his kidney was damaged, not destroyed, but damaged. He might need dialysis in a few years instead of decades. My mom looked at me in the hospital waiting room and asked the question that made everything click. Would you consider donating your other kidney when he needs it? My dad nodded like this made perfect sense, like I was born to be Adam's personal organ donor, like that was my only purpose in their lives. I stared at them for a long time. I asked if they'd even checked on how I was feeling after my surgery. My mom looked confused. You're fine now, she said. You recovered. I asked if they remembered that I missed my 8th grade graduation because I was too weak to walk across the stage. They didn't remember. I asked if they knew I still couldn't run without getting dizzy. They didn't know. I asked if they would have had another baby if that baby to give Adam kidneys, too. The silence told me everything. I Moved in with my grandma that night, packed one bag and left. My parents called once to ask when I was coming home. I told them I already was home. Two years later, Adam needed dialysis.

I had to choose. I'm at work on a Tuesday morning when my wife texts, having contractions. Think this is it. Meet you at Memorial Hospital. I'm grabbing my car keys when my phone rings. It's my twin sister, and she's sobbing. My water just broke. I'm scared. I'm headed to Valencia Hospital. Please come. I freeze in the parking lot, holding the phone up to my ear. My wife is 39 weeks pregnant with our first baby. My sister is only 34 weeks, making this a high risk pregnancy. And her boyfriend left her two months ago after they found out the baby has down syndrome. The hospitals are 45 minutes apart in opposite directions. I stand there like an idiot while the two most important women in my life need me in two different places. I drive toward my sister first because she's alone and high risk. I call my wife from the car. When I tell her, she's crying, but says she understands. My sister texts, contractions getting stronger. Nurse says I'm 4 centimeters dilated. I think back to when my sister held my hand through our dad's death when we were 16. She's been there through my depression, my divorce from my first marriage, everything. She chose me as her birth partner months ago when her boyfriend bailed. My wife texts, contractions five minutes apart now. Then I'm scared, too. Then we promised We'd do this together. My wife has an anxiety disorder and she's been planning this birth for three years. The playlist, wrote letters to the baby. We practice breathing exercises every night. I'm driving when my breathing starts coming in faster and my hands are shaking so bad I swerve into the other lane. A truck horn blares and I yank the wheel back, nearly going off the road. I have to pull over on the highway shoulder just so I can gasp for air. Full panic attack. Head and hands on the steering wheel trying to breathe. My phone explodes with calls. I answer them one by one. My mother in law is screaming, we just got to the hospital. Where are you? How dare you leave her right now? My father in law texts, get back here now. Man up and support your family. Then my mom calls, we're getting on a plane, but that's five hours away. You need to step up as her big brother. Your sister has nobody. The baby might not survive. My dad texts, blood comes first. Your wife has family. Your sister has no one. I sit there for a moment longer, breathing. Then I call both hospitals. My sister's nurse says she's asking for you. She's terrified. My wife's nurse told me she's progressing fast. Where are you? My phone's at 5% battery from all the calls. At this point, the last thing I hear is my mother in law saying If you're not here when that baby comes, don't bother coming home. My phone dies right there in my hands, still vibrating. With another call coming in. I choose to go to my sister because she's alone and at higher risk. I speed toward her hospital, crying the whole way. I run into the emergency room, asking for her delivery room. The nurse looks confused.

When I moved from Beijing to northwest England, I quickly realised that the people weren't exactly welcoming to an Asian student. On my first day, I wanted to make some friends, so I walked up to a group of girls sitting near the windows and asked if I could join them for lunch. The blonde one literally recoiled from me and loudly went, Ew, while the others burst out laughing. One of them started doing that stupid pulling your eyes back thing while saying, go back to China in but she thought was a Chinese accent. I kept my expression neutral and then walked away with as much dignity as I could manage while they kept laughing behind me. A week later, I finally made friends with some theater kids who actually treated me like a human being. My new friends were excited to try the dumplings I brought for lunch, and for the first time since arriving, I felt like maybe things would be okay. Then that same blonde girl walked past carrying her water bottle. She tripped and dumped the entire thing over our table. Water soaked through everything, including the container of dumplings I brought. My friend sat frozen while she said, oops, my bad, I'm just cleaning the table and walked off laughing. When I tried complaining to the counselor, he gave me a patronising smile saying, girls, Will be girls. Maybe I should try harder to understand the culture. I wanted to scream that getting water poured on my food had nothing to do with culture. My breaking point came a few days later when I was walking home after school. I saw the group of five girls, including the blonde one, standing on the sidewalk and my stomach dropped. They spotted me immediately and before I could cross the street, they rushed over and surrounded me. My heart was racing and I could feel panic rising in my throat. But I tried to stay calm and said firmly, move out of my way. But they just laughed harder. The blonde one said something to the others and they all reached into their bags. At the same time, they pulled out their water bottles and I realized what was about to happen, but there was nowhere to go. They unscrewed the caps in unison like they were first it and then they all poured everything on me at once. The water was freezing cold and there was so much of it that I literally started shivering. As they walked away laughing, the blonde one called me the c word, slur, and they all thought that was hilarious. I'd never felt so humiliated and angry at the same time. Something inside me just broke. When I got home, I told my mum I've been caught in the rain because I couldn't bear to see her face if she Knew the truth. The next morning, I marched into the counselor's office and told him everything that had happened. He listened to the whole story, then shrugged and said since it happened off school grounds, there was nothing they could do about it. That was when I knew I had to handle this myself. I left his office and went straight to the engineering department where I knew they kept supplies for building theater sets. I found a bottle of brown acrylic paint and poured it into an empty water bottle. Then I waited. The next day after P E, I spotted the blonde girl walking back to the main holding by herself. Her hair was perfectly styled, even though she just been sweating in gym class, which seemed to be her superpower. She was checking her phone and walking slowly, which gave me the perfect opportunity. I followed her, keeping just enough distance that she wouldn't notice my heart was pounding and my hands were shaking, but I kept going. When I got close enough, I pulled out my water bottle, uncapped it, raised it over her head and poured the entire contents over her pristine blonde hair. The paint was thick and dark brown and it immediately soaked into every strand. She was just startled at.

I was six beers deep at the hotel bar when Alan put $300 on the counter. Bet you can't give a toast at that wedding next door. We could hear the DJ through the wall asking for speakers. My girlfriend had just dumped me over text for never taking risks or putting myself out there. I've been telling my friends all night that I could charm anyone, and Alan decided to test me. The guys all leaned in to see if I'd take the bet. The reception was at that point where they open the mic to anyone who wants to speak. My drunk plan was simple. I pretend to work with the groom and give a generic business guy speech. Rob told me dedication and commitment were perfect wedding words. The ballroom doors were open and people were walking freely between spaces. My shirt was wrinkled, but the lights were dim enough to hide it. I walked in from the hotel bar, and when the DJ saw me approaching the microphone, he looked relieved that someone finally volunteered. I grabbed the microphone and a champagne glass from a passing waiter and told everyone I needed a moment outside because big moments get to me. While people smiled and nodded and the bride sat up to listen, I started with safe stuff about knowing the groom from work and watching him grow as a professional before pointing at the bride and saying, this guy talks. About you, the way he talks about his biggest wins. Everyone laughed while the groom mouth thank you from his table with tears forming in his eyes. I kept going with generic lines about late nights at the office paying off. Remember those long nights when everything seemed impossible? I said, getting nods from everyone who'd ever worked late. Well, now you found someone worth losing sleep for. My voice cracked when I mentioned what makes a good partnership because that's what my ex said I couldn't do, but I pushed through and finished by saying they deserved all the happiness in the world. The room exploded with applause and the groom caught me in a huge hug saying it meant everything. Probably too emotional and drunk to wonder why he didn't remember me. And that's when Natalie walked up with dark hair and a smile that made me forget why I was there. She pressed a napkin with her purple penned number into my hand while saying I work for the wedding planner and I've never heard such a beautiful toast from a business guy. And we ended up dancing for a few songs while my friends watched from the doorway in shock. During our last dance, Natalie asked coffee sometime? Right in my ear and I said yes immediately. When my friends texted that the hotel bar was closing, she squeezed my hand, making me promise to call before I left, feeling better than I had in weeks. Two weeks later, the bride tried to send me a thank you card, but couldn't figure out who I was. The wedding planner pulled security footage and saw me walking in from the public bar and grabbing a glass from their reception waiter. The hotel banned me using my credit card information from the bar tab. That night, Natalie texted the planner

The landlord started laughing. My roommate's boyfriend, Wesley, had been planning this moment for months, ever since he started staying over back in June. He'd been telling his boys about how he was finessing his way into a free apartment. He even started forwarding his mail here to establish what he called residency rights. The relationship wasn't even official before Wesley started making his move. He'd walk around my apartment, well, what he thought was going to be his apartment, measuring rooms and telling his cousin which wall would be perfect for his TV setup. Melanie's been carrying this dead weight for too long, he'd mutter while eating my groceries. Time for her to learn she doesn't need a roommate anymore. So there I was, standing in my own living room on a Thursday night. The whole place smelled like the Cologne Wesley bathed in. Wesley showed up with his cousin Mitchell and two duffel bags, already acting like he owned the place, both of them looking like they were ready to physically move me out if needed. Melanie, I hope you found somewhere else to stay, Wesley said, dropping his bags by the door. This is happening tonight. You've been taking advantage of my girl's kindness for long enough. I stayed quiet, scrolling through my phone, let him have his moment. Melanie sat on the couch, avoiding eye contact with everyone. Wesley had been working on her for weeks. Convincing her that I was holding her back, that they needed their privacy, that couples shouldn't have roommates. She'd started parroting his words recently. Maybe it's time for a change. Maybe we've outgrown this arrangement. Classic Wesley manipulation. The man didn't even have his own place. He been couch surfing. Before he latched onto Melanie, Wesley pulled out a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket. I printed out this 30 day notice. But honestly, you should just go tonight. Make this easy on everyone. Mitchell nodded like this was all perfectly legal. Smart move, Wesley. She's had a free ride long enough. I looked at the paper and almost laughed. He downloaded some random eviction template and just wrote my name on it in pen. Melanie finally spoke up, her voice barely a whisper. Maybe we can give her the weekend at least. Wesley shot her a look that made her shut up immediately. Nah, baby, we discuss this. She goes tonight. That's when I made the call. Hey, Mister Sanders, I said, putting him on speaker. Could you come up to 2C? We have a situation here. Wesley's chest puffed out. Good. Call the landlord. I'm taking over this lease. Anyway, Melanie and I are common law now. Five minutes later, Mister Sanders walked in with his master keys jingling. He was this 60 year old Brooklyn native who'd owned the building for 30 years. He took one look at the scene. Wesley with his bags, Mitchell trying To look intimidating, Melanie shrinking into the couch and me standing there calm as could be. What's going on here? Mr. Sanders asked, though his slight smirk told me he already knew. Wesley stepped forward with all the confidence of someone who'd watched too many law shows. I'm moving in and she's moving out. I've been living here for three months, which makes me a tenant. Melanie and I are together, so I'm taking over her half of the lease. Mr. Sanders looked at Wesley like he'd just said the earth was flat. Then he started laughing. Not a chuckle, but a full belly laugh that went on for a solid thirty seconds. Wesley's face. He started twitching. What's so funny, old man? Mr. Sanders wiped his eyes and pulled out his phone. Let me show you something, son. He pulled up a document. This is the lease for apartment two C. See that single name? That's not Melanie. That's not

Uncle Wayne was worth millions, but lived like a miser, constantly testing our family to see who was worthy of his money. Every holiday was an audition where cousins would compete for his approval like desperate contestants on a reality show. I'm leaving everything to whoever proves they don't need it. Announce at family dinners while everyone kissed his ass and hung on his every word. My cousins would bring him expensive gifts they couldn't afford, offer to clean his house for free, practically beg for his attention and validation. They'd research his interests and pretend to share his hobbies. My cousin Kyle even switched his major to business because Uncle Wayne mentioned he respected entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, I brought nothing and sat in the corner reading a book, completely disinterested in his little power games. Grace doesn't seem to care about family, he'd say loud enough for me to hear. Testing to see if I'd scramble for his approval like the others. You're right, I'd reply without looking up from my book. I don't care about your money, either. This always made him pause. While my cousins were falling over themselves to prove their worth, I was actively proving my indifference. While they fought over who could drive him to appointments and grocery shop for him, I got a second job and started Saving every penny. While they argued about his will, I was building my own future. When they'd ask why I never visited Uncle Wayne, I'd say, he has plenty of volunteers. I found his manipulation disgusting. Watching grown adults to base themselves for money made me sick. I'd rather be broke with dignity than rich through desperation. My cousins thought I was crazy. Don't you want financial security? Anna would ask. I'm setting myself up without begging. Tell her. While they spent their weekends doing his yard work and running his errands, I was working overtime and taking online courses to improve my skills. While they were buying him birthday presents and Christmas gifts, I was investing in my education and building an emergency fund. Dynamic was fascinating to watch. The more desperate they became for his approval, the more he seemed to enjoy withholding it. The more I ignored him, the more curious he became about me. At family gatherings, he'd try to bait me into conversations about money and success. I'd give polite, brief responses and go back to whatever I was doing. I wasn't rude, but I wasn't performing for him either. Grace, what are your career plans? He'd ask in front of everyone. Working on it, I'd say. Simply not elaborating. This drove him crazy because he couldn't figure out my angle. Everyone else was transparent in their attempts to impress him, but I genuinely didn't seem to care about his opinion or his money. The The day he died, everyone gathered for the will reading like vultures circling fresh prey. My cousins had been speculating for years about who would inherit what. They'd made alliances and enemies within the family based on their perceived chances. The lawyer cleared his throat and began reading. Mr. Wayne has left his entire estate, valued at $3.2 million, to his niece Grace, with a note that reads, she was the only one who never asked me for anything because she was too busy building something for herself. The silence in that room was deafening.

The compensation was $800 plus a hotel voucher. This businessman in an expensive suit storms over and taps my shoulder. Hey, you should volunteer. I have a million dollar deal closing tomorrow. I politely told him I had an important interview and couldn't give up my seat. His face turned red. Do you know who I am? I fly first class every week. You look like you could use that $800 more than I need this hassle. I said no again and put my headphones back on. But he wouldn't let it go. He sits down right next to me. Listen, I'm trying to be nice here. That interview can be rescheduled. My deal can't. I told him he didn't know anything about my situation and asked him to leave me alone. He laughs and pulls out his phone. What company? I probably know the CEO. I. I can make one call and get you a better position. I ignored him completely and moved to a different seat across the gate area. He actually follows me and sits down again. You're making this harder than it needs to be. I'm offering to help you out here. Other passengers started noticing this guy literally following me around the gate area, starts talking loudly to anyone who listen. Can you believe this? I offered to compensate him personally. And he's being completely unreasonable. A woman with kids nearby asked him to keep it down because he was being, he turns to her and says, ma'am, I'm trying to solve a problem here. Then he goes back to the gate agent and I hear him say, that guy over there refuses to volunteer. Can't you just bump him instead? The gate agent explains that's not how it works and they need actual volunteer. He storms back over to me with this entitled smirk, fine. The gate agent suggested I negotiate directly with passengers. I told him the gate agent definitely didn't say that and he was lying. His voice gets even louder. I've been flying for 20 years and I've never met someone so stubborn. Now half the gate is watching this spectacle he's creating. He pulls out his business card and waves it around. I'm a senior partner at Donaldson and Associates. Look it up. Nobody cared about his business card, but he kept waving it anyway. Then he starts approaching other passengers, asking if they'll volunteer and pointing at me saying, he won't do it, so maybe you will. This college kid tells him, dude, leave him alone. You volunteer if it's so important. Snapped back, I'm in first class. They can't bump me. It has to be someone from economy. The college kid laughs and says, then deal with it like everyone else. He's getting more aggressive now, pacing around the gate area and complaining loudly. To anyone who'll make eye contact. Then he pulls out his wallet. Fine, I'll give you 1,000 cash right now. Just take the voucher, I told him.

When my wife and I had our first kid, Jason. Parenting felt almost easy. He was the kind of kid who made you think you were nailing at his parents. Quiet, thoughtful, always looking out for his mom. If she was tired, he'd sit with her on the couch and rub her arm. If we were out, he'd hold doors open, help carry groceries. Never needed to be told twice he wasn't perfect. No kid is. But there was this gentleness in him that made me proud every single, single day. Then came Olivia. From the second she could talk, she filled every room she entered. Loud, funny, charismatic, full of fire. Strangers would stop us at the store and say, wow, she's going to be a leader one day. And for a while, I believed it. I was proud of her boldness, proud that she wasn't afraid of anyone. But that spark changed as she got older. The boldness turned into sharpness. She lied about small things, then bigger things. He manipulated. She'd spill juice on the carpet and blame Jason, break something in the house and swear she didn't touch it. She always had an excuse, always managed to twist things so it seemed like someone else's fault. And little by little, I watched Jason fade. We tried everything, therapy, discipline, extra attention, less attention, family meetings, reward charts, stricter rules, softer approaches. Nothing stuck. Olivia always stayed one Step ahead. To outsiders, she was the sweet, funny girl. At home, she could be cruel when no one was looking. Then came the day everything cracked open. She told us Jason had been touching her inappropriately. My world split in two. Jason denied.

On my first day, I wanted to make some friends, so I walked up to a group of girls sitting near the windows and asked if I could join them for lunch. The blonde one literally recoiled from me and loudly went Ew! While the others burst out laughing. One of them started doing that stupid pulling your eyes back thing while saying go back to China in what she thought was a Chinese accent. I kept my expression neutral and then walked away with as much dignity as I could manage while they kept laughing behind me. A week later, I finally made friends with some theater kids who actually treated me like a human being. My new friends were excited to try the dumplings I brought for lunch, and for the first time since arriving, I felt like maybe things would be okay. Then that same blonde girl walked past carrying her water bottle. She tripped and dumped the entire thing over our table. Water soaked through everything, including the container of dumplings I brought. My friend sat frozen while she said oops, my bad, I'm just clean in the table and walked off laughing. When I tried complaining to the counselor, he gave me a patronizing smile, saying girls will be girls and maybe I should try harder to understand the culture. I wanted to scream That getting water poured on my food had nothing to do with culture. My breaking point came a few days later when I was walking home after school. I saw the group of five girls, including the blonde one, standing on the sidewalk, and my stomach dropped. They spotted me immediately, and before I could cross the street, they rushed over and surrounded me completely. My heart was racing and I could feel panic rising in my throat. But I tried to stay calm and said firmly, move out of my way, but they just laughed harder. The blonde one said something to the others, and they all reached into their bags at the same time. They pulled out their water bottles, and I realized what was about to happen. But there was nowhere to go. They unscrewed the caps in unison like they've heard, and then they all poured everything on me at once. The water was freezing cold, and there was so much of it that I literally started shivering. As they walked away laughing, the blonde one called me the C word slur, and they all thought that was hilarious. I never felt so humiliated and angry at the same time. Something inside me just broke. When I got home, I told my mum I'd been caught in the rain because I couldn't bear to see her face if she I knew the truth. The next morning, I marched into the counselor's office and told him everything. That had happened. He listened to the whole story, then shrugged and said since it happened off school grounds, there was nothing they could do about it. That was when I knew I had to handle this myself. I left his office and went straight to the engineering department, where I knew they kept supplies for building theater sets. I found a bottle of brown acrylic paint and poured it into an empty water bottle. Then I waited. The next day after P E, I spotted the blonde girl walking back to the main building by herself. Her hair was perfectly styled, even though she'd just been sweating in gym class, with seemed to be her superpower. She was checking her phone and walking slowly, which gave me the perfect opportunity. I followed her, keeping just enough distance that she wouldn't notice. My heart was pounding and my hands were shaking, but I kept going. When I got close enough, I pulled out my water bottle, uncapped it, raised it over her head, and poured the entire contents over her pristine blonde hair. The paint was thick and dark brown, and it immediately soaked into every strand. She was just startled at

My school had this completely insane bathroom rule where you could only use the restroom twice per day. Two times. That was it. They gave each teacher a clipboard with our names on it and they had to check us off every single time we asked to go. The whole thing started because some kids were apparently vaping in the bathrooms. So instead of dealing with those specific kids, the administration decided to punish everyone. They hired Mrs. Wilson as the bathroom monitor, and she took her job way too seriously. This woman would literally stand outside the bathrooms timing how long we were in there. By November, half the school was walking around looking like they were about to explode. My friend Connor actually wet himself during third period math because he already used his two bathroom passes for the day. The teacher just ignored him and kept teaching while this poor kid sat there humiliated. That's when Emma had enough. She was this quiet girl who never caused trouble, but she was also the smartest kid in our grade. During lunch, she pulled out the student handbook and started reading through all the bathroom policies. He found something interesting on page 47. The rules said students were limited to two bathroom visits per day, but it didn't say anything about how long each visit could be. Emma realized we could technically stay in there for hours as Long as we only went twice, Emma started spreading the word. She told us to bring books next, whatever we needed. The plan was simple, make each bathroom visit count. So we did exactly that. The next Monday, I grabbed a sandwich and my history textbook before asking for my first bathroom pass. I stayed in there for 45 minutes, studying for my quiz next period. When I came back, my teacher looked annoyed.

The judge decided to bring Lila into his chambers to ask what she liked about staying with each parent. Nothing too serious, just basic questions to understand her routine. Lila bounced into the room wearing a bright pink dress with unicorns on it, swinging her legs from the big chair and grinning at everyone. The judge smiled and asked her, do you have fun when you stay with your daddy? Lila nodded enthusiastically, oh yes! Daddy lets me wear makeup to the stripper place. The entire room went dead silent. Max turned bright red and his lawyer actually choked on his coffee. Tasha's mouth dropped open and her attorney started scribbling notes furiously.

Yeah, like an hour ago. Why? He dropped to his knees right there on the kitchen floor. For a second, I thought he was joking, but then he started dry heaving into the sink. She ate it. The whole thing. His voice cracked. He ran out to the bathroom, slamming the door. That's when Delilah burst through the front door, still in her dental hygiene scrubs. She must have left work early. Where's Killian? She asked, breathless. He texted to call 9 1 1 and something about you eating the last slice. Delilah pounded on the bathroom door. Killian, baby, what's wrong? He came out, eyes red, and showed her something. Delilah's face went from worried to devastated in seconds. Now. Oh, she whispered. No, no, no. My phone buzzed. It was our landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry. Rent can wait this month. My stomach cramped suddenly, sharp enough to double me over the chocolate cake. Another wave of nausea hit, and I barely made it to the kitchen kitchen sink. My roommate Damien rubbed my back, which was so out of character, I'd have laughed if I wasn't puking. She's been waiting two years to eat that cake, Killian muttered, looking at Delilah, who was now sitting on the floor, crying her eyes out. Two years for what? I gasped between heaves. Nobody answered. My phone rang. It was my mom. Hey, I'm So disappointed in you. How could you do this? She hung up before I could ask what she was talking about. We need to go to the hospital, Killian said. Now. What? Why? It's just food poisoning. Delilah stood up, her face pale. It's not food poisoning. Please, just trust me. We need to go now. Killian was already grabbing his keys. The cramping was getting worse. In the car, Delilah wouldn't even look at me. Killian kept checking his phone and wincing at whatever he saw. What was in that cake? I asked again, starting to panic. The pain was spreading. Delilah finally spoke, her voice hollow. My future just. We'll deal with it at the hospital, Killian said. At the ER, Killian ran ahead to talk to the intake nurse. I couldn't hear what he was saying, but she looked shocked and waved us through immediately. That's when I knew something was really, really wrong. Delilah looked like she might cry or scream or both. A doctor appeared with a portable X ray machine. We need to check your stomach contents immediately. For food poisoning? He exchanged a look with Killian and Delilah. Not exactly. Let's just see what we find. A nurse started prepping an IV. Any allergy Jeez I should know about? She asked. Medications? Latex. She paused, looking at her clipboard. Reactions to platinum or white? Gold. No, I answered, completely confused. They made everyone leave the room while they X rayed my abdomen. The Doctor studied the image on his tablet, zooming in on something. Killian's mom appeared in the doorway. She looked at me like I'd killed her dog. Is it still intact? She asked the doctor. It's been in my family for 90 years. The room went silent except for the beeping machines. Delilah finally looked at me, her face a mask of controlled rage. There's definitely a metallic object in your stomach, he whispered. I stared at him. A what? Delilah's face went red with anger. You ate my engagement ring. I what? Killian cleared his throat. I hid Grandma's ring in your favorite cake. I was going to propose. That was my cake from my boyfriend for our anniversary. It was on the middle shelf. The words tumbled out as my brain tried to catch up. That's the communal shelf. Everyone knows that. I was saving it for tonight. Delilah's voice rose. You. You literally have your own shelf. Your name is on it in purple Sharpie. My stomach gurgled again. The ring was in there, supposedly worth thousands of dollars. Floating around with a chocolate cake I thought was communal property. The doctor handed me a bottle of thick white liquid. This should speed things along. You'll need to and everything to recover the ring. Delilah started crying. Killian was still listing everything he had planned. His mom was facetiming with angry relatives. My roommate texted me. This is why I label everything, even my water bottles now. Next. Time, I told Killian as another cramp hit. Maybe just use a ring box like a normal person. There won't be a next time. Delilah screamed. The doctor cleared his throat. Well, this is certainly going to be an insurance nightmare, destroying property worth thousands. You're a thief! Killian's mom's fat. Delilah wiped her tears. Your type always takes what isn't theirs. As I sat there with the laxatives, I remembered something. Something that would make them regret how they treated me. I reached for my phone in my pocket and pulled out the photo gallery, scrolling back to yesterday afternoon. There it was, the chocolate cake, sitting right on the middle shelf of our fridge, with my handwritten note taped to the white bakery box that said Happy Anniversary, Brandon. Love me in blue pen. I turned the screen toward them and watch their faces change. Killian went white first, then his mom, then Delilah, who grabbed the phone from my hand to look closer. The time stamp showed three forty seven PM yesterday, clear as day. Killian started opening and close, closing his mouth like a fish, trying to find words that wouldn't come out. He finally managed to stammer about how Delilah had mentioned wanting chocolate cake last week and he just assumed when he saw it.

She returned 6 years later to find I'd divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years, Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation. To our eight year olds, that first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home, and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curveball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year two brought unexpected changes. Without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her bonus mom. Their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes, and tucked them in at night. Year five was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and. And being the mom who stayed, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year six, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward. After three Years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place.

She could pack an entire house in 48 hours, make friends at every new base within a week, and somehow kept three kids fed, clothed and in school through 8 different moves. She ran every FRG meeting while dad was deployed, organized care packages for the whole unit and never missed sending him his favorite beef jerky. Even when money was tight, she was the one other spouses called at 3:00am when they couldn't handle another night alone. Dad was coming up on his 20 years and mom had been planning for this moment since deployment No. 3. She'd saved every penny she could, researched real estate in Colorado where her sister lived, even picked out the exact house she wanted with the wrap around porch. Just one more year, she kept saying, then we can finally plant roots for a real home. The kids can finish high school in one place. The reenlistment ceremony was supposed to be next Tuesday. Mom thought it was Dad's retirement ceremony. She'd invited her whole family from Colorado, bought a new dress. Hell, she even made a photo album of all our moves titled The Journey to home. I helped her glue every picture. There was one of her crying in the driveway of our first base housing, pregnant with me. Another of her painting my sister's room for the fourth time in a different house. He written little notes under each one, things Like move No. 3 left behind the garden I planted and move No. 6, Tommy's best friend stayed here. But here's the thing, nobody knew dad had already re enlisted three months ago, signed another six years without saying poop. And that wasn't even the worst part. Mom found out at the FRG Christmas party. We were all there. The whole battalion family thing, kids running around with cookies, some Colonel's wife talking about resilience or whatever. Mom was helping serve punch when she overheard two lieutenant's wives gossiping by the dessert table. Did you see Major Wilson with Captain Brooks at the P X yesterday? They weren't even trying to hide it anymore. The other one laughed. 20 years his wife's been waiting and he's spending his reenlistment bonus on jewelry for another woman. Mom's hand froze on the ladle. I watched her face change real slow like watching ice form on a window. She sat down the punch walked straight across that community center and stood right in front of dad. He was laughing with some other officers by the Christmas tree. Is it true? That's all she said. Real quiet. Everyone around them stopped talking. Dad's face did this thing where he tried to look confused. Honey, what are you the re enlistment? Captain Brooks, is it true? The whole room was dead silent. Even the kids stopped running around. You could hear the shitty Christmas music playing from someone's phone. Dad straightened his uniform, looked her Right in the eye. We should discuss this at home. Mom laughed. Not a real laugh, the kind that makes your skin crawl. Twenty years, 20 years I've waited for you to come home. Really come home. Not just between deployments, not just for a weekend home. Her voice was getting louder. I've been the married single mother. I've been the mover, the, the keeper of everything while you played soldier. And you couldn't even tell me you signed away six more years of my life. Some colonel tried to step in, saying something about maintaining decorum. Mom turned on him. Decorum, decorum. Where was decorum when I was in labor with our second child and he was in a rock? Where was decorum when I had to explain to our son why daddy missed his high school graduation for a training exercise? She turned back to dad and Brooks. Really? She's 23 years old. Dad's jaw tightened. Linda, you're being hysterical. This is what military wives do. You knew what you signed up for. Maybe if you understood. Sacrifice. Sacrifice. Mom pulled out her phone, started scrolling. Let me tell you about sacrifice. I have 4,000 photos on this phone. You're in 217 of them. I know because I counted. I counted. While you were deployed. Again, she threw the phone at his chest, bounced off his medals. I sacrificed my career, my family, my friends, my sanity, my children's stability, everything. For what? So you could fuck your Co worker and sign up for more years without asking. You're embarrassing yourself, had said. Picking up her phone from the floor. And me in front of my command, mom nodded real slow. You're right. I am embarrassing myself, believing for 20 years that this would end, that I mattered as much as your precious career. She looked around the room at all the other wives. Some were crying, most were just staring. How many of you are waiting for retirement, too? How many of you think it'll be different when they hit 20? Nobody answered. Mom walked over to the dessert table, picked up the sheet cake that said Merry Christmas, 4th Battalion families in red and green frosting, walked back to dad and dumped the entire thing on his dress blues. The frosting hit his medals with this wet splat sound that made Katie gasp. Behind me. Red and green icing dripped down on Dad's chest, onto his shiny shoes, while chunks of yellow cake stuck to his ribbons. The whole room just froze, 300 people watching cake slide off major David Wilson's dress blues onto the waxed floor of the Fort Carson Community Center. Colonel Miller pushed through the crowd and stopped right in front of dad, his face turning purple. He didn't even look at mom, just stared at the mess on Dad's uniform and said real quiet that dad better be in his office at 0, 600.

Ever since I was born, our house had an open door policy. If that open door policy took steroids, my dad specifically loved enforcing it and always told us that if a door was left closed, I could say goodbye to it. I always thought he was joking until I turned 5 and experienced it myself. I was in the room with my dolls with a closed door, when suddenly it slammed open. Next thing I knew, dad had his tools out and was taking the door clean off its hinges. He then went out into the back and burned it. Still had my bunny stickers on it, but he didn't care how hard I cried. On top of that, by dinner, not only the door, but the dolls I bought with my own money were burned, too. I cried to my mom, but all she could say was that dad had anxiety about hidden dangers, so it was best to just let him feel safe. Thing is, this only got worse as I got older. When I got my first period, I desperately wanted some privacy, but the curtain my dad installed wouldn't fully close. Naturally, I shut the door. That's when he barged in, claiming nothing natural needs hiding. He stood there while I changed my tampon in the shower, telling me not to be shy. I thought it couldn't get much worse. But I was wrong. After weeks of begging my mom for a sleepover, she finally agreed for my 14th birthday. My friends arrived excited, having never visited until they saw our doorless house. There were a few strange glances thrown my way, but we moved on, running straight to my room, giggling with excitement. But the happiness did not last long. My dad started hourly safety patrols with his flashlight, peering into my room. He came in and examined every one of my friends, telling them to twirl to make sure they didn't have anything on him. And since I was the only one with the skirt, I had to twirl the longest. My friends were too creeped out and got their parents to pick them up the next day in school. Everyone was whispering about my doorless house and creepy dad. Their parents banned them from talking to me. I lost all my friends and became completely isolated. I remember at this time, I began truly hating my dad, and that only intensified at 16. I woke up to him pulling off my blanket. I screamed at him, and he went red before claiming he was searching under my mattress for contraband. My mom actually tried to intervene, but she was dragged out of my room. All I heard was the slap before the house went silent. The next morning, my mom had a bruise, and my door frame had a camera set up in it. I left at 17, with just a backpack to go to college. I didn't speak to either of them for full 20 years. And I should have left it like that. But one day I decided to bring my 12 year old daughter to visit. I didn't want to see dad, only mom. So I had her promise me that she'd keep my dad away from my daughter. She said yes. Well, at around 2:00am, I woke to the feeling of my daughter pressing into my chest. She was sobbing that Grandpa had been touching her hair. And that's when I saw the blanket we had put up for some privacy have been torn down. Dad had been touching my daughter the whole time we slept. I rushed out and saw him in his room sleeping, pressing the blanket against his chest. I wanted to call him on the spot, but before I had the chance to confront him, my mom appeared out of the bathroom. I could see visible signs of what must have been her attempting to stop him. She broke down and started whisper apologize

But I never told my husband grant, because his whole family raises golden retrievers and they literally have more photos with dogs than with people. On our third date, grant suggested we visit a dog park and I panicked and said, I'm allergic. When his face just dropped, I added, severely allergic. And now it's been eight years of this ridiculous lie. I carry fake Epipens filled with Vitamin Water like some kind of spy. I've left 17 birthday parties doing my whole itchy eyes performance.

Then after about a week, I started to notice grant has been doing laundry constantly now, which is weird because this man once wore the same shirt for a week. He says he just wants to help more, but something feels really off about it. My son suddenly volunteers to take out the trash every single day and he literally sprints to the garage, then to the bins like he's training for the Olympics. He won't even let me help when the bags are heavy. Meanwhile, my daughter keeps spending time in the garage organizing dad's tools, which makes zero sense. Because this girl thinks a Philip's head is a hairstyle. But then I find these muddy paw prints by the garage door yesterday. And they're definitely not from a cat like grant claims, because what cat has paws the size of a toddler's hand? There's creepy scratching sounds from the garage at night and grant says it's probably raccoons. But since when do raccoons whimper? Then credit card Bill comes in and I see it has a 47 dollar charge from Petsmart. Grant says it's fraudulent and he'll handle it, but he never actually calls the think about it. I find a bag of dog food in Grant's trunk when I'm getting groceries. And he says it's for donations at work. But his office doesn't even have a coffee fund, let alone donation drives. This morning I wake up and there's blonde hair on my pillow. That confirms it for me. And I'm about to fake a reaction. But then my brain kicks in because if I have an allergic reaction now, grant will wonder why I didn't have one while I was literally sleeping face first in it all night. So I just vacuum it up quickly and pretend I saw nothing. Grant starts testing me at dinner, casually mentions the neighbor got a new puppy and watches my face like he's a detective. So I have to do my whole routine, scratch my arms and sniffle. But he looks suspicious. My son asks, mom, what happens if someone With allergies accidentally touches a dog but doesn't know. My heart stops and I ask why this little boy has the nerve to say just curious for science class. But I know they're studying volcanoes. My daughter leaves her phone open to Google search is about how to tell if someone is really allergic and can allergies suddenly go away, which makes my stomach drop because my 12 year old is apparently Sherlock Holmes. Now this morning grant says he found fur on our bed sheets. He shows me this chunk of long golden fur and says the window was open, must have blown in from somewhere. So I have to pretend to feel itchy and take a fake Benadryl in front of him. All the while he watches me swallow it like he's monitoring a science experiment. I even had to open my mouth and lift up my tongue. Then he says something that makes my blood freeze. Funny thing, I found your allergy medication in the bathroom. And he holds up my prescription bottle. I looked up these pills and the markings don't match Benadryl. They match vitamin C tablets. He continues and his voice is so calm it's terrifying. Also, you slept on that pillow with fur for hours with no reaction. And yesterday when you were napping, something else happened in our bed that should have sent you to the hospital. I literally can't breathe because he knows. They all know. But then he says we Need to talk in the garage, all of us right now. I follow them like I'm walking to my execute. I open the door and immediately find a golden retriever puppy jumping on me, licking my entire face, fur absolutely everywhere. And my skin doesn't react. No hives, no, no sneezing, nothing. Instead, I scream bloody murder and trip trying to run away. My daughter starts crying and grant says quietly, this dog slept in our bed yesterday on your pillow. Actually, we have a video. That's when my son whispers, three months we've had him three months. The dog brings me a tennis ball like we're best friends and nobody knows what to say.

Um, hi. Who's this? I can't tell you that, but I go to your school. We've never talked, but I've had a crush on you since middle school. If you had a crush on me for so long, why have we never spoken? Because I'm scared and I don't know if you would feel the same way. Why don't we play a game? Okay. What kind of game? You have until July to figure out who I am. Is this an excuse to get me to talk to you for the whole year? Pretty much. Why not? I do need to let you know I already have a crush on a girl in my school, so don't get your hopes up. That's fine. Let's see what happens. Hey, you looked hot today. You were watching me. It's kind of weird. Rizz app, respond with, how could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? How could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? Wow, that actually made me feel good. At least give me clues about yourself. Why? So I can at least get a starting point on who you are. Fine. I am blonde. That doesn't help me. There are lots of blonde girls in our school. Be more specific. I have a birthmark on my neck, so I have to go check every blonde girl's neck. So tell me about this girl. You like her name? Is Violet. She's perfect. We have never spoken, sadly. Do you know her, violet? Oops, sorry. I do know her. Maybe when I find out who you are, you can introduce me to her. You can ask her right now and she will say yes. How can you be so sure? I'm too scared to ask her. Don't worry. She is nice. Okay. Good night, mystery girl. I'm going to get some sleep. Good night. What? I don't get a message today? Ah. Does someone miss me in your dreams? I was just surprised how my crush since middle school hadn't messaged me today. I have a question for you. Sure. Ask away. How could you have loved me for so long if we haven't spoken ever? You are handsome. The way you talk to people, you are such a kind soul, polite. You make everyone laugh. You are a gentleman. I always knew you are what I always wanted. Now I really wanna know who you are. Patience. Hey, hey, can I admit something to you? Sure. I'm not interested in Violet anymore. Really? How come? She's beautiful. So beautiful that I was too scared to even go near her. That's the issue. She's perfect in every way, but I have fallen for someone else. Someone who I do speak to, someone who understands me, someone without a name or a face, but someone who loves me. The day you find out who I am, I hope we will. Be together. Me too. Mystery Girl, can I confess something to you? Sure. What's up? I think it's time to tell you who I am. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

All seniors, please report to the auditorium immediately. Bring your phones and school IDS. Teachers, this is not a drill. I looked around as the class froze. Even our teacher looked rattled. Something was wrong. As we entered the auditorium, security guards were stationed by every exit. A row of unfamiliar adults sat at the front with laptops. Principal Mister Granger step to the mic. There has been a serious breach of our academic integrity policy, he began. Effective immediately, all senior students devices will be searched. Gasps erupted. Some kids laughed nervously, others panicked. Yesterday, Mister Ranger continued, we discovered a shared Google Drive folder containing answer keys to every major exam from the past two years, including finals. Whispers turned into full on murmuring. Based on digital evidence, the folder was accessed by over 120 student accounts. We are investigating all logins, I P addresses and messages linked to this ring. One of the tech guys stood up and started calling out names. Each student had to hand over their phone and Chromebook and sit in a designated section. My name was called. I hadn't seen the folder, never even heard of it. But apparently someone had shared it with everyone in a certain group chat. Even opening the link made you guilty by association. As I handed over my Phone, my hands shook. It had my whole life in it. The auditorium turned into a courtroom. Over the next two hours, more names were read, more devices collected. Some students started crying. One guy vomited in the back row. I sat next to my bed.

No, I don't really listen to the radio. Okay, well, that's a good did I like win something or what? No, you didn't. Um, listen, and you could still win Colin. We do a segment on this show. It's called The 2nd Date Update that's where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up not wanting to see them after, they can email us to get you on the phone and ask why. So we recently got an email about you. Alright, is this like a like a game show or something? I I mean, I guess sort of. Yeah, like a dating game show. Yeah, it's a second date game show right now. Alright, cool. Let's do it. No, it is not actually a game show. Like we're not gonna you're not gonna compete for a prize here. Well, maybe you're competing for a prize. I don't know. Anyway, we got an email about you from a girl named Amy that you went to a winery with. Oh, I don't really wanna be on this game show anymore. Too late, Colin. You're locked in now. Amy wants to know why you don't wanna see her again. She said a lot of really nice things about you. She was nice. But like she was, I don't like to use the word crazy, but psycho. Would you like to go with that instead? If you don't want to use crazy, that's not, that's not, I mean, there are other words you could use. Maybe she's just like unhinged or something. Whoa. I feel like that's more intense than even crazy. She didn't sound unhinged when we talked to her. Do you guys talk to her? Yeah. Yeah, we talked to her. She sent us an email about your date. And when we talked to her a little bit about it, she sounded perfectly normal to me. Said that you guys had a great time. And now you're like, it's obvious that you don't wanna see her again. I mean, it was like I went on a date with like two different people. So at one point of the day someone spilled something on her. I guess she started like freaking out about the spill. And I was like looking, I didn't see anything. Like I looked on her shirt. I looked on her like everything she was wearing like I don't see any spill. And then she's started going on like, oh, it's, it's on my shoe. You see spilled water on my shoe. And I look at her shoe and I don't see anything on her shoe. Like she's with, we're going over the top and I don't even see a spill. What? So I'm like, I'm trying to like Help her. So I'm like, do you need tissues? Do you need like a napkin? And what do you need me to do? Like I tried to be really helpful, but I'm staring at her shoes and I'm like, dude, there's nothing here. So it was just a over reaction to not spilling wine on her shoe that it was way more than an over reaction. And it got to the point where I had to take her away from the group and like calm her down because she was like flipping out about this imaginary thing. Was she about ready to like crack open a wine glass and cut somebody with it? I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if she.

I smiled like the movie with Katniss Everdeen. No, silly. It's when we see who cries first from being hungry. I never lose anymore, but Millie still does. Her little sister, maybe 5, was sitting in the corner clutching her stomach. How long do you play this game? I asked, keeping my voice light. My record is three days, Ava beamed with pride. Daddy marks it on the fridge chart. Millie only made it one day before or she cried like a baby. My assistant Jackie shot me a glance. That's when I noticed how Ava's dress hung loose on her frame. That's impressive, I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Do you play this game a lot? Every week, sometimes twice. If we've been bad, like when I forgot to clean my room, I had to play for four days. Four days is a really long time without food, I said, watching her stuff crackers in her pockets. What happens when someone loses? They have to wait longer, daddy says. Only we kids need food every day. Millie whimpered from her corner. My tummy hurts all the time. Ava whipped around. Shut up. What's wrong with you? You'll lose points. Do you want to wait another week? My hands stilled on the book I was preparing to read. That seems like a long time for the game, not Really? Theo went nine days once, but then he fainted at school and the nurse got all weird about it. Now he's not allowed to play anymore. She said it was pity for Theo. Theo's your brother, foster brother. He went to live somewhere else. Daddy said he was too weak for our family. Ava, when did you eat last? I asked casually, like we were discussing the weather. She counted on her fingers. Tuesday, daddy says, I'm getting stronger. It was Saturday. This child hadn't eaten in four days and was out of it. I noticed Millie's hair was thin, patchy in places. Her arms looked like twigs. And what about breakfast or snacks? I prompted gently. Oh, no, that's cheating. When we play The Hunger Game, it's nothing at all. Not even milk. Water is okay, though. Daddy's not mean. The way she said it, like allowing water made. I'm generous. Sent ice through my veins. Well, it's story time. Everyone eats, I said firmly, pushing the entire snack tray toward them. Different rules here. While the other children arrived, I watched Ava carefully portion out food to her sister, whispering, eat slow so you don't throw up. My stomach turned. They've done this before, Ava, I said quietly during snack time. Does your mommy play the Hunger Game too? Sometimes, but she cheats. I caught her eating crackers in the bathroom once. Daddy made her play for a whole week after that. She kept crying and saying She was sorry, but rules are rules. I excused myself to get more supplies and called CPS for my office. I have two children here showing clear signs of systematic starvation, I whispered urgently. The older one hasn't eaten in four days and thinks it's a game. Back in the story room, I sat close to the girls. During reading time, Ava leaned against me and I could feel her ribs through her dress. Do you play other games at home? I asked. During craft time, the strong game, Millie piped up. We stand with our arms up until someone and drops them. Ava nodded. I lasted two hours yesterday. Daddy says we're building character. She showed me the underside of her arms. Bruises lined them where blood had pooled. Sometimes we play the quiet game in the cold shower. If you make noise, you stay longer. I documented everything on my phone while pretending to take pictures of their crafts. When Ava stood up, I noticed her legs were modeled with purple marks. Those look like they hurt, I said gently. Only weak kids feel pain, she recited. Daddy's Making us Strong for when the world gets hard. Their mother arrived to pick them up, designer purse swinging, looking annoyed. Come on, girls, we have training this afternoon. I handed Ava an extra bag of snacks for the road. Her eyes went wide. But I haven't earned food yet. Her mom shot me a look to see if I'd Catch on story time. Food is free, I said with an innocent smile. No earning required. As they left, Millie turned back and waved with a smile that broke my heart. Two hours later, CPS arrived at their house with police backup. The investigation revealed a nightmare. Food charts on the fridge showed Ava once went 82 hours without eating for talking back. But that wasn't the worst part.

I found my work crush share crying in the break room, looking completely stressed. My dad's in the hospital, and I need to fly out tonight, but I can't find anyone to watch my kids. My ex won't answer, the babysitter I hired bailed, and I just. I can't afford to miss this flight, but I can't afford anything else either. She leaned against my shoulder, crying even harder. I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said, heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids. Three for at least two weeks. I waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest, around 14, looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work, Camilla. The middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, seven, wouldn't even look at me. They stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Cher hugged them quickly, told them to be good, and left for the airport. I stood there with three kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. First morning, I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed. She's not here, you know. You can stop trying, she said. Besides, you're Not her type. Mom doesn't date guys without kids. We've seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Shares, co workers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps. Everyone wanted to play dad until they realised three kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. Spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings. They hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive two weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy, be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Sometime within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Just leave me alone, he said, turning away. I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get mad at you or do anything without your permission. Not even tell your mom. But I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't have a dad. I Patted his head and walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. The next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rental G T R, strikingly white engine, purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved, wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now? I said loudly as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop, and quickly he hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said. I picked up the other two kids and took them to in and out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a helmet full of nachos, and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. Not bad, old man, Camilla said, watching her siblings enjoy the game. We made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard and everything to their mom with a caption we wish you were here. After that, things between me and the kids sort of changed. When the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom, I sat beside her bed reading out fairy tales. Until she fell asleep, I made the kids meals and lunch box

So I drove him straight into another state while he slept. Mr Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper just to throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he'd always had his favorite line. In the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into driver's ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my but dropped like a stone. Where do I turn? I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise, though with your steering straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchange looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight with you girls. Never know when we're Gonna stop or if we're gonna stop by the third lesson we discovered his pattern because nasty jokes for 20 minutes then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practice highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed he said when I veered slightly. I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife if we survive today's lesson that is three 3 teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon Sophia slightly veered and he exploded. Jesus are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high and why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My 5 year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I and then he was snoring head tilted back against the headrest looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realized he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up on the right And I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five North hanging over the highway. Like a dare, I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering. I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added, me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank back at the sleeping Mister Maya. And as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. Thirty minutes passed, then an hour and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up constantly with white.

I thought I was being a genius parent when my 11 year old son Wyatt kept begging me for money to buy Marvel rival skins every single day. He'd show me his phone with some new character outfit that cost $20 and ask if he could have it. Instead of just saying no or giving in, I decided this was the perfect chance to teach him about earning money through hard work. I spent a whole evening creating the most detailed chore chart ever. Each task had a specific dollar value based on difficulty and time. Taking out the trash was $2 while cleaning the bathroom was five. Washing dishes got $3. And picking up dog poop in the backyard earned four because nobody likes that job. I even laminated the chart and hung it on the fridge with magnets. Wyatt was so excited when I explained the system to him. He calculated that if he did every chore on the list each day, he could earn enough for a new skin in just four days. His eyes lit up when he realized he could actually get the Invisible Woman skin he'd been talking about non stop. We shook hands like business partners and I felt like parent of the year. The first week was absolutely magical. I'd come home from work to find the dishes already done and put away. His room was cleaner than it had been since we moved. In the dog poop that usually sat in the yard for days was picked up daily. He even started doing extra things that weren't on the chart, like organizing the garage and washing my car just to earn bonus money. I brag to everyone at work about my brilliant parenting move. My co workers were impressed and some even asked for copies of my chore chart to try with their own kids. I felt like I'd cracked the code on teaching kids responsibility while also getting help around the house. Wyatt was learning the value of hard work and I was getting a clean house without having to nag. By the second week, Wyatt had developed a whole routine. He'd wake up early to do some chores before school, then knock out the rest right when he got home. He kept track of his earnings in a little notebook and would show me his running total each night at dinner. It was more organized than most adults I knew and I was genuinely proud of him. Everything was going perfectly until I came home on a Tuesday afternoon to find the house exactly as I'd left it that morning. Dishes were piled in the sink and Wyatt's backpack was thrown on the floor instead of hung up. I figured maybe he was sick or had a lot of homework, so I didn't say anything at first. But when I went to let the dog out, I saw three days worth Of poop in the yard. I found Wyatt in his room playing Marvel rivals on his computer. When I asked about the dishes and dog poop, he didn't even look away from his screen.

So I've been feeling like the backup friend for months. It started when I got really sick with the flu last winter. I'm talking fever, can't get out of bed sick. I texted our group chat asking if someone could bring me soup or medicine from the store. Radio silence for three hours. Then finally, Emma responds with, Oof. Feel better. And that's it. But two days later, when Brad wanted people to come help him move his couch, four of them showed up immediately. I started paying attention after that. When I'd suggest hanging out, I'd get excuses. When anyone else suggested something. Suddenly, everyone was free. During conversations, they talk over me or just ignore what I said completely. At restaurants, they'd split the Bill evenly, even though I always ordered the cheapest thing because I was broke from college. The final straw was my birthday last month. I planned this whole thing at Dave and Buster's, sent invites two weeks early. The day of, I'm sitting there alone at a table for seven. One by one, the cancellations rolled in. Emma had a family thing. Tyler forgot he had to work. Jess said her car wouldn't start. But here's the kicker. I saw Tyler's Instagram story. Later that night. He was at some house party with people from our group, including Jess, whose car had mysteriously started working. That's When I decided to test them, I crafted this message about how my mom was in the hospital after a car accident, and I was scared and needed someone to drive me there because I was too shaken up to drive. I sent it to our group chat at seven PM on a Thursday. First response came from Emma an hour later. Oh, no. Hope she's okay. Keep us updated. No offer to help? Tyler hearted the message. That's it? Just hearted it like it was a funny meme or something. Jess texted me privately saying she would help, but her boyfriend had the car. Brad said he was at work until late. Two others never even responded. Six people I'd called my best friends for four years, and when I needed them most, they all had excuses. But here's where it gets interesting. I have this coworker named Alex, who I'd only hung out with a few times outside work. He barely knew me beyond small talk about weekend plans. I decided to text him the same message just to see what would happen. This guy dropped everything. Called me immediately, said he was leaving his girlfriend's apartment right then to pick me up. Showed up at my door 20 minutes later with snacks and a phone charger, asking which hospital and if I needed anything else. I felt so bad. I almost came clean right there. Instead, I told him my mom was okay, that it was just A scare and false alarm. He was genuinely relieved and said he was glad to help anytime. Meanwhile, my so called best friends were still posting TikToks and Snapchat stories like nothing happened. The next day in our group chat, everyone asked how my mom was doing. I said she was fine. Thanks for all the support. The sarcasm went right over their heads. Emma even had the nerve to say that's what friends are for with a heart emoji. I started pulling back after that. Stopped initiating conversations, stop suggesting plans. Guess what happened? Nothing. They literally didn't notice I was gone. Three weeks passed before anyone texted me directly, and it was only because Tyler needed someone to cover his shift at the pizza place where we both worked. Last weekend was the breaking point. I saw on Instagram they all went to this escape room place we talked about going to for months, the same place I'd suggested multiple times, and got shut down. There they were, all six of them, posting stories with captions like squad goals and best friends forever. So I made my decision. I started a new group chat called Real Friends Update with just Alex and two other people who'd actually shown they cared. I posted about moving on from fake friendships and finding people who actually value you.

Mom and I were waiting for you to come into our room and jump on us and tell us to come open presents. There was none of that. And I really needed it today.

My 11 year old daughter started acting like a grown woman and I thought it was just early puberty stuff. But then I realized something much darker was happening. My daughter was one of those girls who hit puberty like a freight train. One month she was my little girl in Pokemon t shirts. The next month I was desperately searching the junior section because nothing in kids sizes would button across her chest. I started noticing the attention before I could pretend it wasn't happening. We were at target when she said casual as anything that the man in electronics had followed us to three different aisles. She didn't sound scared, just stated it like a fact like she was telling me it might rain. It got bad when she started consuming content that no 11 year old should even know existed. Her iPad history at 2:00am showed romance novels about CEOs and secret bookmark folders labelled Dark Romance and Age Gap. She discovered Wattpad and archive of our own, reading explicit stories about innocent girls and men who know better. Her YouTube algorithm had shifted completely. Makeup tutorials for that clean girl aesthetic, how to look expensive, feminine energy that drives men crazy. She was watching videos about how to walk in heels, how to make your voice sound more sultry, how to flirt without being obvious. When I tried to stop her from consuming that Content. She turned into someone I didn't recognize. She started using therapy speak to manipulate every conversation. I was gaslighting her when I set boundaries, being toxic when I said no to crop tops, emotionally abusive for taking her phone at night. She'd Learned these words somewhere and weaponized them perfectly. Her friend group shifted overnight. The girls her age were suddenly so immature and childish. She gravitated toward eighth graders and high schoolers who'd wave at her during pickup. Started lying with disturbing ease. He was at the library, but really at Starbucks with older kids at Emma's house, but actually at the mall. She figured out how to delete specific texts while keeping others clear. Only certain parts of her history. Created fake contact names. Emma Mom was really someone named Tyler. She started sitting differently, legs crossed like an adult, hand gestures while talking that she'd copied from somewhere. At family dinners, she didn't insert herself into adult conversations about work, drama and relationships, offering advice like she was 30. When we visited relatives, she spent the entire time with the adults laughing at jokes she shouldn't understand, making comments about wine and coffee preferences she didn't have. The secrets multiplied like cancer. Her phone became Fort Knox. Password changed weekly, face ID disabled so I couldn't use it. While she slept, she'd angle the screen away reflexively. Muscle memory from constant deception. I found out from another mom that my daughter had been telling everyone she was 16, not 11, with a whole fabricated backstory about being held back, started lying about everything. Library visits that were really mall, trips with high schoolers, study groups that didn't exist, sleepovers at houses I'd never heard of. Her bedroom door stayed locked constantly. Music basting to cover phone conversations. She stopped talking to me entirely. Dinner became silent warfare, one word answers while scrolling under the table. Her former best friend's mom called concerned. Apparently my daughter had told the girl she'd outgrown their friendship. At her spring concert, she wore the required black dress, but she'd altered it somehow, taken in the waist, shortened the hem. She looked like a teenager, not an 11 year old. As she walked across the stage, I watched Father's heads turn and follow her movement. These weren't strangers. They were soccer dads, PTA volunteers, my neighbor. Their gazes lingered a bit too long before they caught themselves. But what disturbed me most was her awareness of it. She wasn't innocent to the attention anymore. She expected it and seemed to feed off it. After the performance, she didn't run to me like the other kids ran to their parents. She stood with the older performers laughing at something on someone's phone. When I finally got her attention, she rolled her eyes and mouth five more minutes like I was embarrassing her that night. I waited until she would.

My brother and I used to sneak out all the time, not for anything wild, just dumb, harmless stuff. Late night 7, 11 runs, laying on the trampoline to watch for meteors. One time we snuck out just to see if the new Taco Bell was open 24 hours. We weren't rebels, just bored kids who liked feeling like we were getting away with something. It started when I was 11 and he was 14. He'd tap three times on my wall around midnight, our signal. I tiptoe past our parents room in my socks, meet him by the laundry door and we'd sneak out like little burglars in pajamas. He always carried a backpack with snacks, flashlights and a notebook he pretended was mission logs. I think he just liked pretending we were spies. It became our tradition. Even when we weren't talking much during the day, we'd still sneak out. One time I fell asleep and missed the signal. The next morning, he left a granola bar and a sticky note in my sock drawer that said, rookie Mistake, you're on thin ice, Agent B. But as we got older, things changed, got busier with school, started driving, started dating. I assumed we just outgrown it. No more nightly missions, no more late Taco Bell disappointments. I tap on the wall sometimes just to see, but he never knocked back. Then one night, about a year after our last mission, I couldn't sleep. Too much energy. I tapped on the wall knowing it was pointless, but out of habit, I crept to the laundry room anyway and the back door was already open. I stepped outside. It was cold. Damn. The kind of quiet where even your own footsteps little too loud. I walked to the side gate and that's when I saw him sitting in the driveway, hoodie up, facing away from me. His backpack. The backpack was next to him. I almost called out, but something about the way he was sitting stopped pop me. Shoulders hunched, arms on his knees like he was holding something back. I moved closer and heard it. Quiet, shaky breathing, then a sniff. He was crying. I crouched down beside the car, not sure if I should say anything, but then I heard him mumble something under his breath. I can't do it anymore. He wiped his face on his sleeve and pulled out his phone. I peeked around the car just enough to see the screen. It was a message thread with someone in it.

I'm 23 and my family still cuts my food for me at restaurants. Not kidding. My mom will literally reach over and slice my chicken into bite size pieces while I'm eating it. Growing up as the youngest of seven kids by a huge gap didn't help. My siblings are all 10, 15 years older than me. So they've always treated me like they're living at family dinners. They still ask if I need help tying my shoes or if I remember to brush my teeth. My sister Amanda still tries to help me order at restaurants, telling servers she'll have the chicken nuggets without asking what I want. Last month at my cousin Abigail's wedding was the absolute worst. The whole extended family was there, aunts, uncles, grandparents, great aunts, family, friends. The worst, during cocktail hour, my Aunt Janet loudly announced that I couldn't have champagne because babies don't drink alcohol. She handed me a juice box instead. A juice box at a wedding? I'm 23 years old with a medical degree. Then came dinner seating. My uncle Mark grabbed my arm and said, come on, sweetie, you're sitting at the kids table. I tried to protest, explaining I was an adult, but he was already walking me over to a table full of actual children. Eight year olds coloring on placemats, 10 year olds playing with action figures and me with my college degree and my job. That none of them bothered asking about. The kids kept asking me questions like what grade are you in and do you like our coloring books? I spent the entire dinner helping a six year old nephew cut his chicken while my family laughed from the adult tables, pointing and taking photos like it was cute. My cousin Kelly walked over during appetizers. Ah, look at you helping the little ones, she cooed. Maybe someday you'll be ready for grown up conversations. She patted my head like I was a golden retriever. The breaking point came during cake cutting. When the bride and groom finished their ceremonial first slice, they started serving guests. My Uncle Mark walked over with a plate and a plastic fork. A plastic fork. Let me help you with this, honey, he said, and started cutting my slice into tiny little pieces like I was a toddler who might choke. Uncle Mark, I can careful with the fork, sweetie. He interrupted, taking it from my hands. We don't want any accidents. Remember what happened at Christmas when you tried to use the good silverware? I hadn't dropped anything at Christmas. He was just making stuff up. The entire reception was staring at this point. Other guests were whispering and pointing. Some were filming with their phones. I felt my face burning with embarrassment. That's when the bridesmaid of honor walked over. She was this elegant woman in her 40s looking confused. Excuse me, are you Doctor Nguyen, she asked, staring directly at me. Everyone at nearby tables turned to look. My Aunt Janet burst out laughing, like this was the funniest thing she'd ever heard. Oh, honey, that's just our baby cousin, she said condescendingly. She's still figuring.

A girl got stabbed on the subway and no one helped her. A decomposing body found in D4V D's car. A man was beheaded at Dallas motel. Charlie Kirk getting shot and killed at a university. And all on top of that, the 9 11 was 24 years ago today. As much as I hate Charlie Kirk and his decisions, no one deserves to get killed. Imagine what his wife and kids are feeling right now. His children can't grow up with their dad. His wife is now a single parent. I genuinely hate Charlie, but I can't imagine how his family is handling this right now. And apparently they witnessed it. The way the blood came out of his neck was genuinely traumatizing. The way his body went limp immediately was horrifying. But anyways, moving on to the D4V d situation. He's been on tour for like, what, a month now? He hasn't been in LA for like a month. And the body hadn't decomposed enough for it to be in that car for so long. The body was in there for three days and the police haven't even made him a suspect. And plus, he had a concert like yesterday, I'm pretty sure. But yeah, moving on to the girl that was stabbed, she was literally minding her business before she got stabbed. And as soon as she got stabbed, everyone was so Calm, like, hello, she needs help. There was literal blood dripping on the floor. I don't have much information on the other situations, but the fact that this is all happened in a week is honestly scary. Like this month has just started. What's going on?

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around, and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her co worker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. She showed me his Instagram. Tall, brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem? He didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby, and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed after that first dinner. My mom kept inviting him back. Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand, asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about Basketball scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night, after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us. Said she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly. Made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me. We can't keep this up forever, you know? That message hit me like a truck. I realized he was ready to end this whole thing. And I wasn't. Not even close. Instead, Of texting back or giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place. Cooked his favourite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over. Set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them. Just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggs bells around her mood swings. Year 1 was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I've been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten How to enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor role. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp in the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for.

The landlord started laughing. My roommate's boyfriend, Wesley, had been planning this moment for months, ever since he started staying over back in June. He'd been telling his boys about how he was finessing his way into a free apartment. He even started forwarding his mail here to establish what he called residency rights. The relationship wasn't even official before Wesley started making his move. He'd walk around my apartment, well, what he thought was going to be his apartment measuring room and telling his cousin which wall would be perfect for his TV setup. Melanie's been carrying this dead weight for too long, he'd mutter while eating my groceries. Time for her to learn she doesn't need a roommate anymore. So there I was standing in my own living room on a Thursday night. The whole place smelled like the Cologne Wesley bathed in. Wesley showed up with his cousin Mitchell and two duffle bags, already acting like he owned the place. Both of them looking like they were ready to physically move me out if needed. Melanie, I hope you found somewhere else to stay, Wesley said, dropping his bags by the door. This is happening tonight. You've been taking advantage of my girl's kindness for long enough. I stayed quiet, scrolling through my phone, let him have his moment. Melanie sat on the couch, avoiding eye contact with everyone. Wesley had been working on her for weeks. Convincing her that I was holding her back, that they needed their privacy, that couples shouldn't have roommates. She'd started parroting his words recently. Maybe it's time for a change. Maybe we've outgrown this arrangement. Classic Wesley manipulation. The man didn't even have his own place. He'd been couch surfing before he latched onto Melanie. Wesley pulled out a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket. I printed out this 30 day notice. But honestly, you should I just go tonight, make this easy on everyone. Mitchell nodded like this was all perfectly legal. Smart move, Wesley. She's had a free ride long enough. I looked at the paper and almost laughed. He downloaded some random eviction template and just wrote my name on it in pen. Melanie finally spoke up, her voice barely a whisper. Maybe we can give her the weekend at least. Wesley shot her a look that made her shut up immediately. Nah, baby. We discussed this. She it goes tonight. That's when I made the call. Hey, Mister Sanders, I said putting him on speaker. Could you come up to 2C? We have a situation here. Wesley's chest puffed out. Good. Call the landlord. I'm taking over this lease anyway. Melanie and I are common law now. Five minutes later, Mister Sanders walked in with his master keys jingling. He was this 60 year old Brooklyn native who'd owned the building for 30 years. He took one look at the scene. Wesley with his bags. Mitchell trying to look intimidating, Melanie shrinking into the couch, and me standing there calm as could be. What's going on here, Mr Sanders asked, though his slight smirk told me he already knew. Wesley stepped forward with all the confidence of someone who'd watched too many law shows. I'm moving in and she's moving out. I've been living here for three months, which makes me a tenant. Melanie and I are together, so I'm taking over her half of the lease. Mr Sanders looked at Wesley like he just said the earth was flat. Then he started laughing. Not a chuckle, but a full belly laugh that went on for a solid 30 seconds. Wesley's face started twitching. What's so funny, old man? Mr Sanders wiped his eyes and pulled out his phone. Let me show you something, son. He pulled up a document. This is the lease for apartment 2C. See that single name? That's not Melanie. That's not.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together. I've been playing husband since year two. Paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent, while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down. Tears in her eyes, hand on her heart. Then some perfectly rehearsed excuse. We're not ready, let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal number five. And she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time. Convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favorite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere, and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it. When she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew. And she didn't even let me finish the speech. Just shook her head with this pitying smile. Like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke. Asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant. And the mask Came completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said, voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place? After eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place? Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. By the time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. Didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working. She texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said, I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic started. Creep being in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not your husband, just like you said. She actually laughed at first, thinking it was some kind of joke. She came home that night, acting extra sweet, made my favorite dinner and tried to cuddle on the couch. Okay, you made your point, she said, kissing my neck. I'll think about what you said. Now fix my phone. I moved to the guest bedroom instead. The next morning, she couldn't log into Netflix. Then Hulu died.

I was 17 when I found out about the secret group chat. It happened totally by accident when I was trying to airdrop a funny video to my mom's phone. But when I looked for her device, I saw something called Fam Real instead of just Mom's iPhone. That was weird. So when she left her phone charging in the kitchen later, I checked it out. My stomach dropped when I saw the group members. Mom, dad, my older brother Jake, my sister Emma, and even Aunt Beth. Everyone except me. I scrolled through their messages from that day. They were planning dinner at this new Italian place downtown. Jake had sent a picture of the menu, and Emma was joking about how dad always orders the same pasta. Normal family stuff, except I wasn't invited. Then I saw something that made my chest tight. Emma had written, should we tell Natalie about dinner? Mom replied, she'll just complain about the food or say she's too busy. Dad added, let's keep it simple tonight. I kept scrolling back through weeks of messages. There were plans for mini golf, movie nights, even a trip to the zoo, all happening without me. In one conversation, Jake mentioned how they went to see the new Marvel movie. I had asked them about it the next day, and they said it was sold out. The worst part was a conversation from Three months ago, Aunt Beth had written, we should probably include Natalie more. Mom's response was, she makes everything awkward. Remember her birthday dinner? Emma chimed in. She complained about the restaurant being too loud the whole time. Jake added, plus she always has her headphones in anyway. My birthday dinner. The one where I wore my favorite dress and actually tried to join their conversations. I thought we had a good time. Apparently they spent the whole night annoyed with me. Found messages about a family trip to the mountains last winter. They had gone skiing for a whole weekend. When I asked where everyone was, they told me they were visiting grandma. I even texted grandma to see how she was doing, and she seemed confused about why I thought they were there. There were inside jokes I didn't understand, references to things that happened when I wasn't around. Jake had sent a picture of dad wearing Mom's reading glasses, and everyone was laughing about it. Emma wrote, classic dad moment, No.. 847. I had no idea what that meant. I sat in the dark kitchen reading message after message. They talked about me like I was some annoying neighbor kid, not their daughter and sister. In one thread, they were discussing Christmas plans. Aunt Beth suggested we all go to her cabin. Dad wrote, sounds great, but what about Natalie? Mom replied, we'll figure something out. My hands were shaking as I scrolled to the very beginning. Of the chat, it started eight months ago, right after my 17th birthday. The first message was from Emma. Finally, we can plan stuff without drama. Jake had replied. Best birthday present ever. I heard footsteps coming toward the kitchen. I quickly closed the phone and pretended to get water from the fridge. Mom walked in and smiled at me like nothing was wrong. Hey, sweetie. How was your day? I wanted to scream. I wanted to show her what I found and ask why they hated me so much. Instead, I just said it was fine and went to my room. That night, I lay in bed thinking about every family moment from the past year. All the times they said plans fell through or events were canceled. All the times they came home laughing about something and stopped when they saw me. All the times I felt left out and thought I was being paranoid. The next morning at breakfast, they were all acting.

Our cafeteria had this weird echo problem in the back corner where the ceiling tiles were loose. If you whispered there during lunch, it would amplify and carry across the entire room like a ghost voice. I discovered this by accident when I was hiding back there, eating alone, complaining under my breath about Mr Rodriguez's impossible math test. Suddenly, half the cafeteria turned around looking confused. That's when the idea hit me. I started small, whispering random stuff during lunch to test the range. Someone left their car lights on or free pizza in the gym, just enough to watch heads turn and people look around confused. The acoustics were perfect. My voice would bounce off the loose tiles, get amplified by the weird ceiling cavity, then float across the room like some supernatural announcement. It sounded nothing like my normal voice, more like a distant radio transmission or a voice from another dimension. But then I overheard the drama that would change everything. Jessica Chen was bragging to her friends about how she'd been anonymously reporting kids to administration for vaping. I've gotten like 12 people suspended, he laughed. They have no idea it's me. I just sent anonymous tips to Principal Walsh's email. She was proud of it, genuinely proud of ruining people's lives for a few extra points on her college applications. Perfect. Target acquired. The next day during lunch, I positioned myself in the Echo corner. I Waited until Jessica was surrounded by her usual crowd, then whispered just loud enough. Jessica Chen is the vaping snitch, the whisper.

My wife came home from yoga class yesterday looking like she'd been living in the woods for three months, no shower, hair looking like a bird's nest. And I swear she smelled like she'd been wrestling with a garbage can. He flopped down on the couch next to me while I was watching TV and asked, so what do you think of the new me? I tried to dodge it, told her it doesn't matter what I think as long as she's happy. But she kept pushing. Come on, I really want to know how you feel about this whole natural lifestyle thing. See, about six months ago, she joined this yoga class downtown. The instructors, some lady named Rainbow or Sunshine or something equally ridiculous. Ever since then, my wife's been on this kick where she thinks deodorant is toxic, makeup is poison, and shaving is oppressing her natural feminine energy. She showers maybe twice a week now and only if she gets visibly dirty. I've been keeping my mouth shut because, hey, her body, her choice. But when she kept asking for my honest opinion, I figured she actually wanted it. You really wanna know, I asked. Yes, I do. So I told her I miss the woman I fell in love with. She used to smell amazing when she hugged me. She'd spend time getting ready for our dates. She brushed her hair. I really don't like this whole all Natural thing, but it's not my decision. Wrong move. She started crying immediately, called me a shallow, vain jerk who only cares about appearances. Then she stormed off to the bedroom and slammed the door. But here's where it gets interesting. About an hour later, I heard her on the phone with someone. The walls in our house are thin, so I could hear everything. She was talking to her yoga instructor explaining what happened. The instructor's response, he's trying to control your journey back to your authentic self. This is spiritual abuse. I need to show him that you won't be manipulated. That's when I realized this wasn't just about yoga anymore. This was some kind of weird cult thing. The next morning, I woke up to find my wife had thrown away all my Cologne, aftershave and even my body wash. He replaced everything with some homemade soap that smelled like dirt and lavender. When I asked what the hell she was doing, she said we were both going to embrace the natural lifestyle together. I put my foot down, told her I wasn't throwing away my hygiene routine just because some yoga lady convinced her that soap was evil that started World War 3. She accused me of being materialistic and brainwashed by society. I pointed out that basic hygiene isn't materialistic, it just being considerate to the people around you. She said I was proving her instructor's point about spiritual abuse. This went on for three days. Three days of sleeping on the couch, eating awkward silent dinners and having my wife lecture me about toxic masculinity every time I brushed my teeth. Finally, I'd had enough. I called her sister Emma, who's always been the voice of reason in the family, told her the whole situation. Emma showed up the next day for what she called a sister intervention. She took one look at my wife and said, girl, you smell like a gym sock that's been left in a locker for six months. My wife tried to explain the whole natural lifestyle thing, but Emma wasn't having it. There's a difference between being natural and being gross. You can eat organic and do yoga.

My dad was absolutely convinced that Spanish would ruin our family's future. I was forbidden from taking Spanish class even though we lived in El Paso. While my friends chatted with half a neighborhood, I stood there like an idiot, smiling and nodding. Dad had this rule that we only speak English in America. Anyone who tried talking Spanish to us got the same speech. This is America. We speak English here. He'd say it loud enough for everyone to hear. Even at the Mexican restaurant we went to every Friday, the poor waitress would greet us in Spanish, and dad would interrupt immediately. English, please. My kids don't need to learn that. Mom would look down at her menu, pretending not to notice the other tables staring. I begged him to let me take Spanish instead of French. Everyone takes Spanish here, dad. I'm missing out on conversations with half my classmates. But he'd always launch into his lecture about how immigrants needed to assimilate. They came here, they should learn our language, not the other way around. He'd get this look in his eyes whenever he heard our neighbours speaking Spanish, probably talking about us. He'd mutter, that's why they won't speak English. Our neighbour, Missus Ruiz, felt bad for me. She'd live next door for 10 years and watched me grow up completely cut off from the community. During the summers, when I'd help her with groceries, she Started teaching me secretly. Just little phrases at first. Mija, every child here needs Spanish, she'd whisper while dad mowed the lawn. I'll teach you, but don't tell him. I practiced in my room with headphones on, watching Spanish Youtubers. I kept a notebook hidden under my mattress with vocabulary words. Missus Ruiz would visit me while we worked in her garden. For months, I Learned in secret, terrified dad would find out. That Saturday at Six Flags changed everything. Dad had finally agreed to take us because his company gave him free tickets. My four year old brother, Colin was so excited. He hadn't slept the night before. The park was packed with families for some Mexican Independence Day Celebration. Dad kept complaining about all the Spanish music and decorations. Can't even enjoy an American theme park anymore, he said, loud enough for families to hear. Around noon, dad realized his wallet was missing. His phone, too. Some pick pocket got him in the crowd near the roller coaster. While he argued with security about their incompetence, I turned around and Colin was gone. Just vanished. One second he was right behind me holding his Dinosaur toy. The next second, only his toy remained on the ground. My stomach dropped. Dad! Colin is gone! He spun around, scanning the crowd. Colin! Colin! His voice cracked with panic. Security called it in, but they were overwhelmed with a massive crowd. Thousands of people everywhere. Dad kept screaming Colin's name in English. While family streamed past. Several Hispanic families tried to help, asking in Spanish if we had a photo, but dad waved them off angrily. I heard two maintenance workers talking rapidly in Spanish on their radios. Something about a crying boy near the employee area. A boy lost, 4 years old, near the employee bathroom. My heart jumped. That had to be Colin. But dad was dragging us the opposite direction, still shouting in English. Another voice crackled through their radio. I panicked. Colin wasn't just lost. Someone had taken him and left him there. I grabbed Dad's arm. They found him, the maintenance workers. They're saying there's a lost boy by the employee bathrooms. Dad stared at me. What? How do you know that? Dad, please. They said someone LED him there and left him. We need to go now. His face went pale. Security couldn't understand the rapid Spanish on the radios. I ran to the maintenance workers. They responded immediately, giving me specific directions in Spanish. Behind the first aid station, through the employee entrance, near the back bathrooms. I translated frantically for security while dad stood frozen. We ran through the employee areas, following in their directions. There was Colin, sobbing in a corner, his little arms wrapped around his knees. A janitor was trying to comfort him in Spanish, but Colin didn't understand. I dropped down and hugged him tight. Colin, you're okay. We found you. Dad grabbed him and held him like he'd Never let go. The security supervisor reviewed the cameras later. An older man had LED Colin away by the hand during the wallet chaos. The man had been watching us for 20 minutes, waiting for the right moment. He'd abandoned him in the employee area when he heard the alerts going out. If those workers hadn't reported him in Spanish when they did, the supervisor said, we might not have found him. Before that man came back, dad sat there holding Colin, not saying a word.

My son was diagnosed with a rare heart condition when he was 4. By the time he turned 7, he needed a specialized surgery that only one doctor in Boston could perform. The procedure cost $123,000, and our insurance denied coverage, calling it experimental. We'd already sold our house and moved into a tiny apartment. I was working two jobs while my husband took care of our son, whose condition was deteriorating rapidly. His lips would turn blue during even mild activity, and he'd started having fainting spells. Last month, his cardiologist called us in for an emergency appointment. His heart was failing faster than they expected. If he doesn't get this surgery within three weeks. I don't think he couldn't finish the sentence, but we understood. We were still $11,000 short, despite the gofundme and community fundraisers. I picked up a third job at an upscale hotel bar in downtown Chicago, working overnight shifts after my day jobs. I was surviving on two to three hours of sleep, but nothing mattered except getting that money. On my fifth night, I was so exhausted I could barely stand. That's when Keanu Reeves walked in alone, around 1:00am. He was in town filming. According to the local news. He wore simple clothes and looked tired, sitting at the far end of the empty bar. I recognized him immediately, but could see he wanted privacy. I just nodded and Asked, what can I get you? No name, no recognition. He ordered a whiskey, neat and asked for the food menu. While making his drink. My hands were shaking from exhaustion. I dropped a glass and it

When I was in 6th grade, my school had this weird rule about no jewelry at all, even if it wasn't flashy or expensive. My mom, Dana, had given me this tiny gold ring that belonged to my grandfather, who died the year before. It wasn't much to look at, just this plain band with a college crest carved into it. But wearing it made me feel like Grandpa was still with me somehow. One Tuesday during recess, Mrs. Wilson spotted the ring on my finger and marched straight over. She grabbed my hand and yanked the ring off without even asking that it was distracting and against school policy. I tried explaining it was from my grandpa, but she just shook her head and told me it would be kept in the office for safekeeping until my mom could pick it up. I went home crying that day. When I told my mom what happened, her face went completely still. She didn't yell or anything, just sat there for a minute processing everything. And she said she'd handle it in the morning. Dana showed up at school the next day wearing jeans and sunglasses, looking calm, but something about her energy felt different. She asked the front desk lady to see the ring. The woman said it had already been moved to the principal's office for security. But when my mom got to Mister Fletcher's office, suddenly the Story changed. Now they claimed the ring couldn't be located anywhere. Mister Fletcher was this stiff guy with a goatee and one of those motivational posters about discipline on his wall. He promised to investigate but basically brushed my mom off like she was making a big deal over nothing, said these things happen and they'd keep looking. Two whole weeks went by. My mom called the school, visited twice at the run around. Every single time they kept saying they were still searching but had no updates. Then she showed up one Friday afternoon carrying a box of homemade cookies and wearing a camera around her neck. Like some tourist, she handed the front desk a permission slip she'd typed up about shadowing her son for a family photography project. The secretary barely glanced at it and waved her through. But my mom didn't come to my classroom. Instead, she wandered around claiming she was looking for the bathroom. That's when she ended up in the staff lounge where a bunch of teachers were eating lunch. And there sitting at the corner table grading papers was Mrs. Fletcher, the principal's wife who sometimes filled in as a substitute teacher. On her finger was my ring, my grandfather's ring, clear as day. My mom didn't make a scene or start yelling. She just casually asked Mrs. Fletcher about the pretty ring she was wearing while snapping what looked like a random photo of the room. Mrs. Fletcher, smile.

Every Christmas morning in our house felt like a lottery ticket that I could never win. My family had this weird tradition where my mom would write all four of our names on pieces of paper, fold them up and drop them in an old coffee mug. Whoever's name got picked would receive the golden gift, something expensive, personal or just really special. The rest of us got the usual stuff, socks with cartoon characters, a book we probably wouldn't read, or those cheap gift sets from the drugstore. When I was little, it seemed fair enough. Random chance, right? But by the time I hit 17, I started doing some basic math that made my stomach hurt. Four kids, 17 years of Christmas mornings, I had never been picked, not once. I brought it up casually one year while we were cleaning up wrapping paper. Guess I'm just really unlucky with that hat. I laughed, trying to keep it light. My mom looked up from stuffing gift bags into trash bags. Oh, honey, it's completely random. Your turn will come eventually. That year, my little brother Jake got a brand new PlayStation. I got a vanilla candle that smelled like the inside of a department store. I smiled, played along, helped Jake set up his console like the good big sister I was supposed to be. But something was bothering me and I couldn't shake it. The next few Christmases, I started paying closer attention. The pieces of paper never looked quite the same size. Some were folded differently. And my mom always seemed to fumble around in that mug for longer than necessary, like she was feeling for something specific. Christmas Eve when I was 19, I waited until everyone went to bed. House was quiet except for the furnace kicking on and the occasional creak of settling wood. I crept downstairs to where the coffee mug sat on the kitchen counter, already prepared for tomorrow's drawing. My hands were shaking as I reached inside one piece of paper, just one. I unfolded it slowly, already knowing what I'd find, Jake's name written in my mom's careful handwriting. I stood there in my pajamas holding this piece of paper under the dim light from the stove, feel filling 17 years of disappointment crash over me all at once. It had never been random. It had never been fair. I was just the kid they forgot to love properly. I went upstairs. I grabbed my own paper and pen and wrote out all four names. I folded them exactly the same way, made sure they felt identical. Then I went back downstairs and dumped Jake's name in the trash before putting the real lottery in the mug. Christmas morning, I watched my mom's face as she reached into the mug for the first time ever. She looked confused. He pulled out a name, looked at it, then glanced back. At the mug, like something was wrong. Emma, she announced, her voice flat. My siblings cheered. My dad patted my shoulder. Jake looked genuinely happy for me, which somehow made it worse. My mom handed me a small wrapped box with this forced smile that didn't reach her.

Cause I'm not married. But, yeah, I, I know whose phone that is. Oh, okay, great. Um, is there any way you could possibly give me their name so I can look up their address to kind of return their phone to them? Not really comfortable giving out her information. Um, maybe you could just turn it into the cops or something, and I can get a hold of her and let her know they have it. Okay, I gotcha. I didn't think about the fact that, like, trying to track down a woman I've never met is kind of creepy. No, no, it's cool. I, I mean, it's, it's nice that you're doing the right thing. I just don't think she'd want me giving out her personal info like that. I, I understand. Um, one more thing, though. Um, why does this phone number come up as Chris when it calls you? I'm sorry, what? When this phone that I found, when it calls you or text you, why does it come up as Chris? You just said this was a woman's phone. How. How do you know that? How do I know it's a woman's phone? You just told me it

At the reading, the lawyer started laughing. My stepfather tried to cut me out of my mom's will. Then the lawyer started laughing so hard he turned red in the face. When my mom, Catherine died last year, I knew her husband Victor would try something shady. He'd been controlling her finances for years while pretending I barely existed. So there I was, sitting in a stuffy law office, surrounded by mahogany furniture and the smell of old money and older grudges. Victor sat across from me, wearing his expensive watch, flanked by his entitled kids, Madison and Trevor. Madison was already planning purchases. First thing I'm buying is that penthouse in Manhattan. Trevor smirked and nodded. I'm getting that Porsche dealership we looked at. Victor just smiled. With those perfect veneers he bought with my mother's inheritance money. He shot me a look that could freeze. Hell, I don't even know why you bothered humming. Sarah. Catherine made it very clear in her final days, you get nothing. The lawyer, Mr. Harrison Stone, walked in with my mom's will. He looked like he was suppressing a grin already. Shall we proceed? He asked. Victor leaned forward, confident. Let's get this over with. I have a golf meeting with my investment broker at four. Mr. Stone cleared his throat. According to this will, Catherine's estate goes entirely to Victor and his children, with a small bequest to the local animal Shelter! And as for Sarah, Victor couldn't contain himself. He sneered, she gets nothing! Five years of marriage and I convinced Catherine that ungrateful children don't deserve inheritances. Addison and Trevor looked smug as sharks, but that's when Mr Stone lost it. He burst out laughing, like genuinely cackling. Victor snapped, what's so amusing

I should have left the playground the moment the blonde woman asked if I was going through a divorce, but my five year old niece was having too much fun on the swings to leave. She cornered me while the other mothers watched, insisting men only showed up here on weekdays when they had custody battles to win, completely unaware that I was the psychologist who evaluated parents for those exact battles. The blonde woman started with whispers to the other mothers, pulling her daughter away when my niece tried to play with her. And finally approached to ask which family I worked for since there was never a man here on weekday afternoons. When I explained I was watching my niece, her mouth tightened into a thin line and she planted herself in front of me. Something familiar about her stance. She told me how her ex husband used to pretend to care about their daughter, too, how he'd show up at playgrounds with the same practice smile I was wearing. And suddenly I placed her from the stack of evaluations on my desk, her Thursday appointment circled in red on my calendar. She tilted her head and asked if I was going through a divorce, too, if that's why I was suddenly playing uncle on a Tuesday afternoon instead of being at work like a normal man. And I kept my face neutral even as my chest tightened, because revealing myself now would only escalate things. Some of us take time off for family, I said quietly. But she scoffed and turned to the other mothers, announcing that divorced fathers always had excuses for why they were lurking around children. She called over a father in an expensive suit who was clearly on his lunch break, grabbing my elbow to position me beside him. And I let her because confrontation would make things worse. She pointed at his pressed shirt, then at my faded one, running her finger along his sleeve, then flicking mine with disgust while explaining to her audience that real fathers could afford to dress properly because they had actual jobs. My molars ground together until my jaw ached as the other mother's murmured agreement. And her confidence grew with every nod she received from her audience. He stepped closer, close enough that I could smell her coffee breath, and loudly asked if I had photos of children on my phone, suggesting that's what men like me did. While the mothers gasped, my hands started trembling as she announced to everyone with an earshot that there was a suspicious man making them all uncomfortable, that mothers needed to watch their children more carefully when strangers appeared. And sweat pulled at the base of my neck as I recognized the spiral from her case file, the same paranoid accusation she'd made about her ex husband. The situation deteriorated when she marched over to a group of playing children, her voice carrying across the playground as she told them to stay away from the scary man by the swings who wasn't supposed to be near kids. If tries to talk to you, you run to your mommies, understand, she instructed, pointing at me, while their eyes went wide with fear. And my stomach twisted as my niece's new friends backed away from her like she was contagious. She circled me like a predator, taking photos from every angle while narrating to the other mothers that predator alert groups needed clear documentation. And bile rose in my throat, knowing these photos would exist forever on the internet, attached to accusations I couldn't disprove without revealing my position. When my niece ran to me sobbing because the other children wouldn't play with her anymore, the blonde grabbed her arm and yanked her backward off her feet. My niece's small body hitting the rubber playground surface hard enough to knock the wind out of her. Your mommy asked me to take you to a safer person, sweetie. Your uncle won't be allowed near you anymore, she said with a fake, gentle smile while my niece gasped for air. And something inside me nearly snapped at watching her traumatize this innocent child to prove a point about her own custody. My niece's terrified screams felt like physical blows as she fought against the stranger's grip, reaching desperately for me while My legs turned to water, her small fingers clawing at the air between us as she dragged her further away. I forced myself to stay calm, knowing any movement toward them would be twisted into aggression. But when she started toward the playground exit with my screaming niece, I had to act. Let her go, I said, my voice steady, despite the rage building inside me. You're hurting her. Her face lit up with triumph as she released my niece and rushed at me, shoving me back against the fence with surprising strength. The chain link digging into my spine as she pinned me there with her forearm across my throat. He tried to lure a little girl into the bathroom, she said into her phone while I struggled to breathe. No, officer, he's getting.

I used to fake sick at least once a month. Nothing dramatic, just your classic ugh, my stomach hurts routine. I'd shuffle into the kitchen, wrap myself in a blanket, throw in a little cough, and wait for my mom to sigh and say, fine, but no video games. She always fell for it. Or maybe she just didn't care enough to argue. This time felt no different. It was a Thursday. I had a math test I wasn't ready for, and zero energy to sit through Mr. Danner's forty five minute rant about fractions, so I pulled out the old stomachache move. My mom was already halfway out the door for work, so she just nodded and left. I grabbed a bowl of cereal, flopped on to the couch, and turned on some cartoons, already feeling like I'd won. Dad works nights, so he usually sleeps through most of the day and the house stays quiet, but around 10:00 I heard his door open. I muted the TV and listened. He walked past the living room without noticing me, phone in hand, and stepped out into the garage. Didn't think much of it at first, figured maybe he was calling in sick or trying to get a refund for something. But then I heard his voice through the wall. And it wasn't his normal voice. It was quiet, tired, flat. I can't do this anymore, he said. I paused. I Tried. I really tried. But I feel like I don't even know my family anymore. I come home and everything's just cold. I tiptoed down the hall, heart suddenly racing. The garage door was cracked open, just like always, and I crouched beside it. I know this isn't what we wanted, but it's where we are now, he said. Every day I feel like I'm just pretend ending. Pretending to be fine. Pretending to be a good husband, a good dad. My stomach twisted. This time for real. I mean, look at him, he said. He doesn't even like me. He doesn't talk to me unless he wants something. And when he does, it's just one word. Answers. I don't even know who he is anymore. My throat went dry. I look at him and all I can think is, what happened? What did I do wrong? When did he start looking at me like I was a stranger? There was silence then. I know it's awful, but sometimes I wonder if I'd be happier alone. Just starting over. Somewhere quiet. Somewhere nobody knows me. My chest felt like it caved in. I haven't said anything to her yet, he continued. I don't even know if I will. But I can't keep going like this. I'm exhausted. I backed away from the door before I could hear more. I stumbled into the bathroom and locked the door behind me. Sat on the edge of the and stared at the floor. He didn't know I was home. He didn't know I was listening. And he definitely didn't know I had just realised something I could never unhear. My dad didn't just feel lost. He felt lost because of me. I stayed in the bathroom for over an hour, just trying to breathe. When I finally came out, he was back in his room. I crept into mine, got under the covers and didn't move for the rest the day. Later that night, he knocked on my door. How's your stomach? He asked. Fine. I mumbled. Need anything? No. He stood there for a second longer, then said, okay, let me know. I said nothing.

I'm close friends with the neighbors and a little while back, I realized my neighbors, they don't take enough videos of their kids. So I'm putting together a video collage of their kids for them for their upcoming anniversary. What? What? Oh my God, dude, you watching? That is, yeah, yeah. Whenever I see the kids playing in the yard, I take no camera, record it. I'm gonna put a soundtrack to it. The neighbors know. They're cool about it. The neighbors know it's, it's, it's total misunderstanding. You know, it's unfortunate happened during the date, but that, that's all it was. Well, hold up. It's not a big deal. You actually had a conversation with your neighbors about this. Yeah. So they know that you're videotaping their kids through your window. Yeah, they think it's a great idea. They're not the best at technology and I'm really good at computers. So they're happy to have me capture some moments, some moments where it looks like somebody's spied on their children. Like there's no audio. They're kind of far away. Like, I don't know that I believe you, Eugene. No, no, we're putting music to it. It's gonna be good. I know.

No, that's not how you do it. Yeah, Robin and Sandy they love it. Dude, it was the middle of the night and it was raining like that's a terrible time to get video first of all and also so creepy if kids went from car to house in the middle of the night. Wait, so wait, were the kids in the yard in the dark in the rain? I'm confused. Yeah. Yeah, they were playing in puddles. Now I have night vision on my camera. The kids were playing in the park. You're videotaping kids with night vision goggles Eugene. Yeah, friendship never sleeps. I I think you guys are misunderstanding what I'm saying. Yeah, I think other things never sleep. Eugene, you are literally have proof that the neighbors are cool with this. Yeah. Yeah, I talk to them. I feel like we need to call the neighbors like I feel like on this one we need to step in. Yeah, I definitely feel like we need to call a lot of people. Yeah, go ahead call them. Sandy loves me. Okay. Wow. I mean, okay, the video cameras died. Let's just bring it back to the date. It just wasn't working for me like on every level every step of the way. So you don't wanna continue game Of Thrones.

Okay, you started answering that before I even asked Diane Rude.

My younger sister, Ariana, turned into a homewrecker the moment my husband Kevin slipped the ring on my finger and started a desperate pick me routine. If Kevin were blue, she'd show up in blue. If you mention liking something, she'd become an expert overnight. If you posted about a restaurant, she coincidentally appeared during our date. It started subtle, almost innocent even, like singing next to Kevin. At every family dinner, Ariana would squeeze between us, claiming she couldn't hear from the other end. I didn't mind, since family is family. But after six months, it got obvious. Kevin joined a gym near his office. Ariana got a membership there the next day, showing up during his workout times in tiny sports bras. Kevin mentioned liking astronomy once. Suddenly, Ariana was texting him NASA articles daily, asking, can you explain this to me? Then came the fake emergencies. Her car broke down near Kevin's office. Her apartment had a gas leak. When I was out of town, she needed help moving heavy boxes that turned out to be empty. Kevin always told me immediately, showing me her texts with eye rolls. She's just young and confused, he'd say, and I agreed. Until she officially went too far. A hard knock at 9:00am, and there stood Ariana in a tiny white sundress, full makeup, hair curled like a magazine. Shoot! I need Kevin's help moving furniture, she announced, pushing past me. Where is he? But we both knew she lived in a furnished apartment. I was about to tell her to leave when she added, I'm sure you have errands to run. You can go away now. She was literally trying to dismiss me from my own home. Kevin came downstairs and she immediately grabbed his arm. Oh, perfect. You're already dressed. I promise I'll return him in one piece. Actually winked at me. I felt my chest burn with rage, but then had a different thought. I headed upstairs, loudly saying, I need to take a bath. But I didn't leave or go to the bathroom. I stayed upstairs where I could hear everything through the vents. Didn't waste any time. Oh my God, Kevin, you're so muscular! She giggled, clearly touching his arm. Do you work out every day? I bet you could lift me with one hand. Wanna try? I rolled my eyes. This girl had zero shame. I kept folding laundry, waiting for Kevin's polite deflection. Instead, I heard him say, seriously, Ariana, can I tell you something important? My heart sank. Oh, god, here we

My 16 year old Sophie had been begging for AirPods Pro all summer, the new 300 dollar model. She'd researched every feature, watched countless unboxing videos, even created a detailed comparison chart showing why the Pro version was essential for her aesthetic. Her birthday arrived and I surprised her with the exact model. I was so proud finding them in stock when they've been sold out everywhere. Her face dropped the second she opened the box. Um, these are the regular AirPods Pro. She held them like they were defective. I specifically said I need the AirPods Pro Max. Everyone at school has the Max version now. These make me look poor. The Max version. This kid wanted the $600 over ear headphones that cost more than my car payment. Her music career consisted of making 15 second TikTok dance videos to trending songs. The Pro version has the same sound quality I explained trying to salvage the moment. These are what actual musicians use for professional work. Mom, nobody cares about sound quality. It's about the look. These tiny earbuds are so basic. The max ones are a statement piece. Was already putting them back in the box. Can you just return these and get the right ones? It's only like 300 bucks more. Only 300 bucks more. Like I was made of money that stung deep. I'd specifically researched which model music professionals recommended. I'd read reviews, compared features. Even asked my friend who works in audio production. I'll think about it, I said quietly, taking the box from her. She was already back on her phone. Thanks, mom. You're the best. Make sure you get the space gray ones, not silver. Silver looks cheap on camera. I just nodded and walked away. Next day, I'm at Apple Store standing in the return line, still feeling terrible about the whole situation. The line was moving slowly and I could hear the customer service conversation happening ahead of me. I'm sorry, ma'am, your card was declined again. Do you want to try a different payment method? I looked up from my phone. A woman about my age wearing scrubs with Maria embroidered on them was standing there with her teenage son. He couldn't have been older than 15, wearing a faded band T-shirt and holding her hand supportively. Um, let me try this one, Maria said, pulling out a different card. Her hands were shaking slightly. Sorry, Miguel. I thought I had enough after paying rent. This one declined too, the employee said gently. The boy immediately stepped forward. It's okay, mom. I don't really need new earbuds for school. My old ones still work fine for online classes. Maria's shoulders sagged like someone had just crushed her dreams. Miho, you've been using those broken earbuds for two years. The left one doesn't even work anymore. And you need them for your virtual music lessons. Maybe next month I'll have Better tips from work, she said, her voice cracking. Your music teacher said you have real talent. You deserve proper equipment. Mom, sharing one earbud with my study group is fine. Besides, my music sounds better when we listen to.

So I drove him straight into another state while he slept. Mr Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper, just throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he'd always had his favorite line. In the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into driver's ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my, it dropped like a stone. Where do I turn, I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise, though with your steering. Straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchange looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight with you girls. Never know when we're Gonna stop or if we're gonna stop. By the third lesson we discovered his pattern. He'd make his nasty jokes for 20 minutes then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practice highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed. He's when I've beard slightly, I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife if we survive today's lesson. That is 3 teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon Sophia slightly veered and he exploded. Jesus, are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high and why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My 5 year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I and then he was snoring head tilted back against the headrest, looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realized he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up on the right And I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five North hanging over the highway. Like a dare, I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering. I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added, me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank, then back at the sleeping Mister Maya. And as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. Thirty minutes passed, then an hour and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up constantly with white.

I paid for this so I'm keeping it moment. My ex wife Emma thought she was so clever during our divorce. We've been married eight years and when things went south, she hired this shark lawyer who promised to take me for everything I had. The divorce was brutal. She wanted the house, both cars, half my business and spousal support. Her lawyer kept saying I was hiding assets and demanded access to all my financial records going back five years. But there was one thing Emma really wanted, my signed Jersey collection. I've been collecting them since high school. Mickey Mantle, Joe Montana, Michael Jordan, worth about $30,000 total. Emma hated that collection, always called it my stupid sports shrine and said it was a waste of money. But now that we were splitting up, suddenly she wanted half of everything, including jerseys she'd mocked for years. Her lawyer argued that since we bought some of them during the marriage, she was entitled to 50% of the collection. The Mickey Mantle alone was worth 12 grand. I tried explaining that most of these were gifts for my dad or things I'd saved up for with my own money before we even met. Didn't matter. Her lawyer wanted receipts for everything. So I spent weeks digging through old boxes, finding every receipt, every certificate of authenticity, every piece of paper that proved when and how I got each Jersey. That's when I found something interesting, the Michael Jordan Jersey, the crown jewel of my collection, worth $15,000. I had the original receipt from 2019, but it wasn't purchased by me. It was purchased by Emma as a surprise for my fortyth birthday. She'd spent months tracking it down through collectors, paid full price, even had it professionally framed. I'll never forget her face when my lawyer presented that receipt in court. She went completely white as he explained that according to her own legal argument, she just proved the most valuable item in my collection legally belonged to her. Her lawyer tried to backtrack, saying it was a gift and gifts don't count. But my lawyer was ready. He pulled out the divorce papers where Emma's team had specifically argued that the source of payment determined ownership, not the intent. The judge looked annoyed. He asked Emma's lawyer if they wanted to change their legal strategy, which would mean starting the entire asset division process over again. That would cost them another six months and 20,000 in legal fees. Emma was trapped by her own greed. If she backed down, she'd lose her claim to everything else. If she pushed forward, she'd have to give me the Jordan Jersey. While fighting for jerseys worth half as much, her lawyer whispered something in her ear. She shook her head violently. They whispered more. Finally, she slumped back in her chair, looking defeated. Fine, she said through gritted teeth. He can keep his stupid jerseys. But I wasn't done. I Stood up and addressed the judge directly. I'd like to make a counter offer regarding the Michael Jordan Jersey. Everyone looked confused. My own lawyer didn't know what I was planning. According to the receipt, my ex wife purchased this Jersey. According to her legal argument, that makes it hers. I don't want to take something that doesn't belong to me. Emma's eyes lit up. She thought I was giving her a 15 thousand dollar dollar victory. However, I continued. I'd like to.

I was the only night keeper at our aquarium who could handle Poseidon, our four million dollar giant Pacific octopus. And that evening he wrapped all eight arms around my forearm to gently pull crab from my beating tongues. His massive 200 pound body moved with surprising Grace through the crystal clear water of his tank. But when any other keeper approached, the same gentle creature became a destructive nightmare that sprayed black ink everywhere and destroyed thousands of dollars worth of equipment. Our new operations director Caroline watched from the observation deck with her arms crossed, clearly unimpressed by what she called my animal dependency problem during yesterday's staff meeting. She believed every creature should have multiple handlers because no single employee should be irreplaceable, especially not because of some oversized sea creature that cost more than most people's houses. Caroline has spent three weeks documenting every minor violation she manufacturer. Writing me up for wearing a different brand of reef safe sunscreen than the one corporate required, even though their brand gave me hives and docking my pay when Poseidon's complex eating routine ran five minutes over my scheduled break. Her masterpiece was hiring Tim, her former assistant manager who spent entire shifts taking Instagram selfies near the shark tank and had never worked with cephalopods in his 24 years of existence. Poseidon hated Tim with the burning intensity of a thousand suns shooting pressurized water jets That soaked him completely whenever he approached the tank. And once Tim slept so dramatically on the wet observation deck that he crashed through a three thousand dollar interactive display about octopus intelligence, Tim's solution was to stand 15 feet away from the tank and throw food pellets like he was feeding pigeons at the park, which made Poseidon retreat to his cave and refuse to eat for two entire days. Then disaster struck on Wednesday evening when major marine research donors were arriving for a private feeding demonstration at 8:30, specifically to see our famous octopus interact with his primary caregiver. Twenty minutes before the VIP tour, Caroline cornered me in the equipment room while I prepared Poseidon's dinner of fresh dungeness crab and puzzle feeders. Tim will handle tonight's demonstration, she announced with fake authority dripping from every word. You're needed in the children's touch tank area for deep cleaning duties. Everyone in that equipment room knew exactly what would happen if Tim approached Poseidon during feeding time, when the octopus was most territorial and aggressive. But I looked Caroline directly in the eyes and explained, obvious anyway, the sign won't accept food from Tim and he becomes violent when strangers approach during his dinner routine. Caroline snapped back that we'd manage without the feeding demonstration and gave me a direct order to report to the children's area immediately or face consequences. I slowly unclipped my security badge and identification card, placing both items on the stainless Steel prep counter. While our senior aquarist and two night staff members watched this confrontation unfold in stunned silence, I pulled out my phone to start recording and told Caroline that the sign was in full hunting mode because it was feeding time and Tim knew where all the equipment was stored. Caroline's face turned bright red when she realized I was documenting our conversation for legal purposes. If you walk out of this building, you're terminated immediately and permanently. I replied calmly that this was perfectly fine with me, already hearing Poseidon's agitated flashing echoing from the deep sea exit two rooms away. I'm recording this for unemployment documentation since you're firing me for refusing to endanger a 4 million dollar animal and potentially injure your completely inexperienced employee. I walked out of the building and barely made it to the parking lot before my phone started buzzing with frantic calls and text messages. Twelve missed calls came in during the first four minutes, starting with panicked messages from our senior Aquarius describing how Poseidon had grabbed Tim's entire arm through the feeding spot and refused to let go no matter.

After watching my dad hit my mom for years, I finally hit him back and ended up in a psych ward. They classified me as violent. So I spent 7 months in a white room with nothing but my thoughts. When I was finally released, all I wanted was a family of my own, one built on love, not fear. That's how I met Noah. He was 6, living in a group home after being removed from his fourth foster placement. The social worker warned me he was challenging, code for traumatized. But when I saw him sitting alone, methodically lining up broken crayons by size, something in my heart cracked open. I sat down beside him and asked what he was drawing. Without looking up, he said a house with no yelling. I noticed burn marks on his arms, perfectly circular cigarette burns. I had similar scars, only mine were from my dad's cigars. The first few weeks were rough. Noah tested every boundary, waiting for me to snap. He'd break things, scream that he hated me, try to run away. But I never raised my voice, never threatened, never hit. Instead, I'd sit with him during his meltdowns, speaking softly until his breathing steadied. One night, I found him in the kitchen at 3 a. M. Stuffing cereal into his pockets. I'm not mad, I said, keeping my distance. But can you tell me why his voice was barely A whisper in case you change your mind about me. Like everyone else, I opened the pantry, showing him the extra shelves I'd installed. This is your food, too. You'll never go hungry here, I promise. Slowly, things improved. He started sleeping through the night, stopped hoarding food, called me dad for the first time after I spent hours helping him build a blanket fort. Then he showed up at our door claiming he changed, found god wanted his son. Noah hid under his bed when he heard that voice, shaking so hard the frame rattled. The custody battle was brutal. His father had family money, hired expensive lawyers. They painted me as unstable because of my psych ward. Stay said a single man couldn't properly raise a traumatized child. But Noah's therapist testified about his progress. His teachers described his transformation from a silent, scared kid to an engaged student who helped younger children. The judge listened. The final hearing was yesterday. Noah squeezed my hand so tight it hurt as his father made one last plea. Then the judge looked at Noah and asked what he wanted. He stood up straight, looked his birth father in the eye and said, I already have a dad, the kind who builds forts and doesn't hurt people. Walking out of that courthouse, adoption papers finally signed no. It turned to me, can we get ice cream? Of course, buddy. Dad. Those other foster homes, they said I was too broken. That No one would want to keep me. I knelt down, meeting his eyes. You were never broken. You were waiting for someone who understood. At night, I heard him crying in his room. When I checked on him, he was organizing his crayons again. But this time, he was drawing our house with both of us inside, smiling. See, he said, pointing, no yelling. Now, whenever Noah has a hard day, we build a fort.

We're just calling to check in with people, see how they're doing. It's part of our service. Yeah, right. Haha. I'm actually calling you because somebody emailed us about you. Oh, God.

You're calling me about Jay? Yes, I am. Jay emailed us and told us about your date, said that it was really awkward because his co worker came along.

There's more out there. But can't you give them. I mean, you can throw a bone on that one. It's not like you've never comforted a girlfriend by talking about what a loser her ex was. Bro talk on a date. Yeah, I wouldn't say that. I wouldn't say that in front of another girl. Be like, oh, dude, she's a waste. You're saying horrible. Like she had man hands. You don't want her.

So he was asking if you Had any friends that his buddy could hook up with? Okay, can you call somebody and get them here right away? Oh my God. So that maybe he can sleep with someone. Really? Yeah. That's when I was like, okay, I'm gonna see you later. He actually asked you if you had a friend that would sleep with him. Yes. And could I get them on the phone right now? Oh my god. That is. What was your response to that? I was horrified and disgusted and I tried to extricate myself from the situation and said I need to leave. Was there like anything enjoyable about the date? I mean, it was funny on the outside. I'm glad I wasn't you know, emotionally involved at that point. Did you ever for once think about a friend you're like, oh, I bet you she'd do it and then almost call them? No, no, no, not at all. Can't even go there. Okay, so Michelle, I know that it sounds like you're a listener to the show and I don't know how many second date updates you listen to, but maybe you forgot that Jay is actually on the other line listening right now. No, I figured that was coming. I'm glad that he got to hear all that. Oh, okay, Jay. Well, you know, you there? Yeah, I'm here. Haha. Pretty harsh recap, Jay. Listen to what she just said. I I I I can't believe she's like saying this. Kind of stuff.

I care about my teenage boy, but I'd be dishonest if I said I wasn't let down by the kind of person he's becoming. My son began getting into this different look back when he was in middle school. At first he just wore black clothes, but once he got to high school, he's gone way too far with his strange style and I really don't like it. My wife doesn't seem to mind, but she's a pretty passive woman and has never been a very strict parent like me. If I were to describe how my son dresses now, he wears big, baggy black clothing and lots of chains and rings. At one point, he was even dying coloured strips into his hair. I remember being so upset the first day I saw this. It was just so embarrassing to see my child walking around like that. Now, I don't have a problem with gay people or anything like that, but I never really wanted that type of thing to be a part of my own household. I've never confronted my son about his sexuality and I really just don't wanna know if he does happen to be. Our relationship is already sort of strained and I feel like if I found out he wasn't straight, it would make it very hard for me to treat him the same. Like I said, I don't have a problem with gay people. I just don't wanna be shoved in my face on top of everything. Ever since my son entered high school, he's made friends with mostly girls. At first I was glad to see this, and I was happy that my son still might have a chance of growing up into a real man's man. But as time went on, I realised that he wasn't in a relationship with any of these girls dead. They were all just his close friends. He constantly has his friends over the house and is part of a friend group with three other girls. To be fair, these girls have always been nothing but polite to me and my wife and are always respectful of our house. Still, it just rubs me the wrong way that my son doesn't seem to have any close guy friends, and I feel like it's not good for him to grow up that way. I tried my best to be non judgmental towards my son, even though to me he looked like more of a freak of nature. Every day the more he kept leaning into his alternative fashion. I didn't understand it, since all of his friends were normal girls. He was the only weirdo in his friend group who dressed like some 90s mall rat. When I look at him, he honestly reminds me of the kind of kids I would pick on in high school. Anyway, about a Year ago, I ran out of patience with him when he came home one day with his nails painted a shade of bright blue. My son had never done anything like this before, and I couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly disgusted. I. I told him that he had gone too far with his emo bullshit and that I couldn't continue letting him make a fool out of himself like this. I told him that at one point he needed to become a man, and painting his nails made him look like some sort of weak top. My son and I had never really been close. We didn't even speak that often, so he looked very hurt as I was telling him all this. But I couldn't help it. He had needed a reality check for so long and there was no avoiding this conversation. I told my son to go get nail polish remover and remove his nail polish right there in front of me. That's when he started to get angry and said that he didn't have to change himself just to appease my dumb homophobic self. My son has never spoken to either of his parents this way, and I knew that there was no way I was letting him get away with it. I yelled at him for cursing at me like that, and I told him that he would remove his nail polish immediately or there would be serious consequences. He said that there was nothing Worse I could do to him than continue being such a hateful father. And that's when I lost my shot. I told him that I would ground him for the entire year if he didn't remove his nail polish within the next 60 seconds. Looked at me and told me that I could try, but I would never be able to control him and that he hated me. He ran up to his room after this, and I followed through on my threat. I took his phone away and replaced it with a flip phone, and he wasn't allowed to go out or have his friends over anymore. All he did after that for the rest of the year was call his friends in his room and completely ignore me. One night, I overheard him crying to my wife about how much he hated his life since being grounded. But all she said was that I was his father and he needed to respect me. Proud of my wife for sticking up to me behind closed doors. And I still felt like I had made the right decision. I won't lie and say that it hasn't been a difficult year. My son stopped talking to me the day I grounded him, and I honestly do miss him. He graduates next year, and I just hope before then he'll realise that I was only ever trying to do what was best for him.

I need extra hands. Yeah, I don't think so. I wasn't about to climb into a bathroom stall with a freak. No, please. I think I might bleed out. Her voice was shaking. And suddenly this wasn't funny anymore. It was summer from my English class, a pregnant senior who everyone whispered about but nobody really talked to. She was sitting on the toilet, gripping the handicap rail with white knuckles, and her face was covered in sweat. What's wrong? I asked, even though I was starting to guess. Please do something. I'm giving birth. She looked up at me with pure terror in her eyes. My whole body went cold. I was 17 and barely knew how tampons worked, let alone babies. But she was crying and alone, and I couldn't just leave her there. I hopped over the stall divider awkwardly and almost slipped on the wet floor. That's when I saw it. The baby was already crowning. There was blood on the toilet seat and the floor, and summer was making the low groaning sounds that scared me more than anything. This was actually happening in a gross school bathroom with fluorescent lights and graffiti on the walls. I'll be right back. I ran out of the bathroom. Still in shock. I sprinted down the hallway to Missus Bashar's classroom. She was my favourite teacher and The only adult I could think of who wouldn't freak out, I burst through her door, interrupting her lecture on photosynthesis. The whole class stared at me. I need your help urgently, please. I was out of breath and probably looked insane. Missus Bashar took one look at my face and followed me without asking questions. We ran back to the bathroom and I could hear summer sounds getting louder. Other kids were starting to peek out of classrooms wondering what was happening. Missus Bashar pushed open the stall door and immediately went into teacher mode. Okay, honey, I'm here. You're doing great. I'm going to support you while she gets the nurse. I didn't need to be told twice. I ran to the nurse's office faster than I'd ever run in PE. When I burst through the door, Nurse Patty was checking Casey's temperature. Casey, who everyone knew was Summer's boyfriend, the guy who'd been bragging about becoming a dad at prom. Summer's having her baby in the bathroom right now. I basically screamed it. Casey's face went from white to green. He threw up all over the floor before Nurse Patty could grab a trash can. But we didn't have time to deal with that. The three of us ran back to the bathroom with nurse Patty grabbing emergency supplies from her cabinet. By now, half the school had heard something was happening. Kids were crowding outside the bathroom door trying to figure out what all the screaming Was about teachers were trying to move them back to class, but nobody was listening. When we got back to the stall, it was chaos. Missus Bashar was holding Summer's hand while she pushed. The nurse immediately took over, checking how dilated she was and telling summer to breathe. Casey stood frozen in the doorway looking like he might pass out. That's when summer grabbed my hand and pulled me close. You have to get.

Just a hobby of mine. What the hell is the hobby? Is it to piss people off? Oh, ha ha. How did you even get my number? I asked the landlord. He said he's asked you many times, but you keep doing it. Well, I always stop when I'm asked to. But it's something I need to do. It's 1:00am. Do it sometime else. You're right. I'm really sorry. You should be. Don't make me have to come up there myself. I won't. Hey! Oh, sorry. I'll stop. I thought I was okay since it's early in the day. No, no, you're fine. I'm not that big of a Karen. Haha. Why did you text me then? I don't know. I guess I was just being curious on what you're doing. A bit nosy, don't you think? Alright, maybe. What's your name? Josh. And you? Jessica. Oh. Oh what? Nothing. Oh, come on, you can't say that and then not tell me. It's the name of a girl I know. Well, I'm better than her. You can't be better than someone who's already perfect. Oh, wow. She's perfect.

Why do you need to know so bad? I don't need to know. I just wanna know. Because you are the only person making this type of noise in the complex. I'm surprised everyone isn't complaining about you. And I told you I'm almost done. After that, you won't need to hear from me again. Oh my. Alright, just finish up. It's 8:00. You have an hour. Okay. And gosh, turn off that music. Sounds like a screeching cat. What? No way you can listen to that! I have to. You don't understand. You're so annoying. Okay, Today is the day you told me you would be finished.

My girlfriend was so insane that she told everyone that we broke up because I cheated on her in her dream. She was a spoiled rich girl who came from a terrible snobby family. They were the kind of people who would wipe their butts with hundred dollar bills if they ran out of toilet paper. If she and I ever got into an argument, she would run back to her daddy who would send her on a week long vacation to Cancun just so she could recover from our arguments. And one of these week long vacations to Cancun, she ended up getting pregnant from one of the six hotel staff she cheated on me with. But when she came back, instead of telling me, she told me that she was breaking up with me because she had a dream in Mexico that I would cheat on her. At this point I was so over the relationship that I didn't care if it ended. After I moved out and moved back to my parents house, I got a call from an anonymous number. When I I picked up the phone, it was my ex girlfriend's father. He called to say you broke my baby girl's heart. Now I'm going to break your head. I'd sleep with one eye open if I were you. I told him whatever and for him and his crazy family to leave me alone. Truthfully, I was scared of him. I knew he had enough money to hire whoever he wanted to do whatever he wanted. When I applied for a new job, I noticed someone was watching me at the office. They weren't just watching me, they were staring. When I left the building, I saw them following behind. I started to look around, and that's when I saw a black van with two men inside it, also watching me. I've seen enough movies to know what that meant. I didn't waste any time. I started running as fast as I could. I ended up running into a park where I found a police officer. I alerted him and told him that I was being followed by three men. I thought that he would help me, but instead he told me to put my hands behind my back and that I was being arrested. I demanded that he tell me why I was being arrested, but he told me to shut my broke ass up. The second he called me broke, I realized that this was all my ex's father I was doing. He paid the cop off to arrest me. At this point, I didn't even fight back. The cop put me in his cop car, and just as I thought, he brought me to my ex girlfriend's estate. When he threw me out of the car, my girlfriend's father was waiting for me, sipping tea like a James Bond villain. I asked him if he was going To take my life away. And all he said was, we need to talk. I followed him inside and passed by my girlfriend, who was getting her feet done. Her father sat me down and there was trembling in his voice. My babe

I thought everyone heard the vacuum cleaner screaming when it turned on. For years. My parents told me I was being dramatic when I covered my ears during everyday stuff. Turns out I wasn't dramatic at all. When I was little, probably like 3 or 4, I'd always ask my mom why the T. V. Was so loud. She check the volume and it would be on like 15 which is pretty normal, but to me it sounded like someone was yelling in my ear. My parents thought I was just being a weird kid. As I got older, things got worse. I started wearing these chunky noise cancelling headphones to school assemblies because the microphone feedback made me wanna throw up. During fire drills I would literally hide under my desk crying because the alarm felt like someone was stabbing my eardrums with a fork. The school nurse started calling my parents saying I was having panic attacks during normal school activities. My mom took me to our family doctor when I was 8. He did the basic hearing test where you raise your hand when you hear the beep. My hearing was perfect so he said I probably had anxiety. That's when the real nightmare started. Every little sound became torture. The microwave beeping sounded like a fire truck Siren. When my dad would start his car in the garage, I could feel The engine vibrations in my chest, and it made me dizzy and sick. Stopped eating dinner with my family because the sound of forks scraping plates made me want to scream. My parents were getting frustrated with me. My mom would say stuff like, normal people don't get panic attacks from the dishwasher running. My dad thought I was making it up for attention. They sent me to a counselor who gave me breathing exercises and told me to download meditation apps. By the time I turned 14, I couldn't function anymore. I stopped riding in cars because the engine noise made me nauseous. Showers hurt my ears so bad, I could only take them for, like, two minutes. I couldn't go to restaurants because the sound of people talking mixed with plates clinking. Sounded like metal scraping against metal. One day during sophomore year, we had a fire drill, and I completely lost it. I collapsed in the hallway, sobbing and shaking. The sound was so overwhelming, I thought my head was going to explode. Three teachers had to carry me to the nurse's office. Most of my teachers thought I was being overdramatic, but my substitute science teacher, Mrs. Lopez

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning, after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day, I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy, and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was. One Afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

I didn't know guys will just stand in the shower for 10 minutes doing nothing. No water running, just standing there like they're waiting for a download to finish. The first time I walked in on it I thought something was wrong. He looked at me all calm and said I'm just mentally preparing. I've never looked at showers the same way. 2. I found out men treat fridges like treasure hunts. He'll open it five times in a row, stare like something new is going to spawn, sigh dramatically, and then eat plain cheese straight from the block. I once asked why he keeps checking. He said in case a snack magically appears. Three I didn't know guys hum to themselves during the most random tasks. My boyfriend will be cleaning the sink, humming what sounds like boss battle music, then suddenly switch to singing about how this sponge is my sword. I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said but it still smells like me, so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6 point 10. They make sound effects for everything. Opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7. They'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8. They'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes, and apparently that's normal to them. 9. They'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car. Groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10.

So I gave them exactly what they asked for. I've been renting this house since 1985. The inside was covered in hand painted murals. I'd spent decades creating Disney characters, fairy tales, elaborate scenes on every wall. I was an art teacher and this house was my masterpiece. The original landlord always promised I'd eventually own it. We had a handshake agreement about the murals as long as they stayed inside, no problem. He passed away before anything was made official. His son inherited the property and came to inspect it with his teenage daughter. She fell in love with my artwork immediately. Dad, this is like living inside a storybook, she gushed, taking photos of every wall. That's when he delivered the news. We're not renewing your lease. My daughter wants this house, but I've been here almost 40 years without a lease. Your month to month. We need you out in 30 days. What about all my artwork? He smiled. That's actually perfect. We want the house exactly as it is for my daughter. Don't change anything. I was devastated but found a place out of state with a proper art studio. My contractor friend offered to help restore the house to move in condition for free since he wanted practice with his new paint sprayer. I'll get it ready for the new owners, he said. Make it perfect for them. The landlord's Son was thrilled. That's so generous. We appreciate you leaving everything pristine. Moving week, we emptied all my furniture into storage. Week 2, my friend started preparing the house. He sanded every single wall. All my murals, Cinderella's Ballroom, Peter Pan's Neverland Beauty and the Beast library, gone. Just colored blotches on bare walls. Then came the primer. His industrial sprayer covered everything in thick white kills. Every trace of artwork disappeared under industrial grade cover.

No, I don't really listen to the radio. Okay, well, that's a good idea. Did I like win something or what? No, you didn't. Um, listen and you could still win Colin. We do a segment on this show it's called The 2nd Date Update that's where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up not wanting to see them after they can email us to get you on the phone and ask why so we recently got an email about you. Alright, is this like a like a game show or something? I I mean, I guess sort of yeah, like a dating game show. Yeah, it's a second date game show right now. Alright, cool. Let's do it. No, it is not actually a game show like we're not gonna you're not gonna compete for a prize here. Well, maybe you're competing for a prize. I don't know anyway, we got an email about you from a girl named Amy that you went to a winery with oh, I don't really wanna be on this game show anymore. Too late Colin. You're locked in now. Amy wants to know why you don't wanna see her again. She said a lot of really nice things about you. She was Nice, but like she was, I don't like to use the word crazy, but psycho. Would you like to go with that instead? If you don't want to use crazy, that's not, that's, I mean, there are other words you could use. Maybe she's just like unhinged or something. Whoa. I feel like that's more intense than even crazy. She didn't sound unhinged when we talked to her. Do you guys talk to her? Yeah. Yeah, we talked to her. She sent us an email about your date. And when we talked to her a little bit about it, she sounded perfectly normal to me. Said that you guys had a great time and now you're like, it's obvious that you don't wanna see her again. I mean, it was like I went on a date with like two different people. So at one point of the day someone spilled something on her. I guess she started like freaking out about the spill. And I was like looking, I didn't see anything like I looked on her shirt, I looked on her like everything she was wearing like I don't see any spill. And then she's started going on like, oh, it's it's on my shoe. You see spilled water on my shoe. And I look at her shoe and I don't see anything on her shoe. Like she's with, we're going over the top and I don't even see a spill. What? So I'm like, I'm trying to like Help her. So I'm like, do you need tissues? Do you need like a napkin? Like what do you need me to do? Like I tried to be really helpful, but I'm staring at her shoes and I'm like, dude, there's nothing here. So it was just a over reaction to not spilling wine on her shoe that it was way more than an over reaction. And it got to the point where I had to take her away from the group and like calm her down because she was like flipping out about this imaginary thing.

What are you talking about? I have appendicitis, mom. I had Katie drive me here this afternoon. I was in so much pain I could barely move. I called you and dad. Neither of you picked up. Elizabeth, I'll come to see you once your father gets home. Benny can't stay home alone and the hospital scare him. Your father should get back in about 2 hours. Can you hang on until then? Don't let them do any procedures on you until I get there. Mom, are you serious? Right now, excuse me. Ben is 12, mom, 12 years old. He can stay home alone. He's not a little baby anymore. He can entertain himself. He doesn't need to be connected to you at the hip all the time or tell him to grow the hell up and just come to the hospital. If it was Ben in the hospital, not me, you'd be here in a heartbeat. You'd drop everything, leave work, leave anything. Elizabeth, how dare you talk to me that way? How dare you be so selfish? Have some respect, mom, you don't understand. You don't respect me. You don't care about anything that I love. You only care about Ben. Do you even love me, mom? Oh, Elizabeth, you haven't noticed a single thing about my life in years. You haven't even bothered to care, mom, you haven't noticed that I have a girlfriend. Mom, we've been dating for a year. Now, we went to prom together, but you make me leave early to pick up Ben from a sleepover because he forgot his iPad at home. My girlfriend and I got into the interview recently. It's on the school website, but you never even watched it. Elizabeth, please let me talk. I'm packing a bag right now. I'm going to bring Ben to his friend's house and head to you. No, all you do is talk and all I do is listen. I'm done, mom. I want you to hear me. Please, Mommy, hear me. I'm listening, Beth. I am listening. I hate myself. I feel like I'll always be nothing. You've made me feel like I'll forever be nothing, like I'll never matter. And honestly, maybe I won't ever matter. I've spent so much time adjusting to what you need me to be, what you expected of me. I stopped even caring if I liked myself. And I don't. I hate myself and I hate that all I do is please other people. Beth, I'm on the way right now. Please just wait until I get there. We can talk. Okay. Actually, no, I will. Listen. I will. I promise. And you talk. I'm sorry. I know. I should have said it sooner. Yeah, you're right. You should have. And it's too late for sorry. At least this way you can finally put that college fund of mine towards Ben's dreams like you've always wanted to. Elizabeth, what are You talking about, what are you doing? Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth, please answer me. Beth, please pick up the phone. I'm 5 minutes away. Mommy, so sorry.

None. I just feel like he's a completely different person than who I thought he was. Did he say something like horrible to you? No, it's just I don't respect him and the things that he contributes to. And, you know, I, I just don't respect him as a human being, the things that he contributes to.

Hi. Can I speak to Lisa, please? This is her. Hey, Lisa. How are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Um, hello. Hello. I'm calling you today because one of our listeners emailed us and asked us to get you on the phone. Really? Mm hmm. It's a segment that we do on our show called The 2nd Date Update. It's where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up blowing them off, they email us and ask us to get that person on the phone and ask why. So you recently went out on a date with somebody that listens to our show. Um, alright. His name is George. I think you would remember going on a date with George because you also invited him to your birthday party. Oh, yes, I did. Sounds like regret in your voice right there. Yeah. You have a second to talk to us about George? Yeah, I have a second. Um, fortunately, yeah. So he told us about how you guys met and he went to your birthday party. He thought everything went great. And then you sent him a text message saying you didn't want to talk to him anymore. Did he do something wrong? What? You know what? He was great with my friends, but the reactions at the end of the night were just not what I expected. Did your friends not like him? They thought it was Kind of a douche or something. It wasn't my friends who reacted about him. It was, it was my parents. Oh, oh, your parents didn't like him? Yeah. Like really? Didn't like them at all. Really? Are they like really strict parents? No, they're not really overprotected. That's why it's weird that they didn't like this person. What did they say to you? Well, they told me he asked questions and they told me, he asked my mom, how many grandkids do you want? What? Yes. Was he joking? My mom said, I don't know. She didn't make it seem like he was joking. Was it in context, though, about something they were talking about? How long was he talking to your parents? He was talking them for a long time. I think he was trying to impress them or something. But he was with them for a while before I got married. My mom would not really bring up grandkids, but some of them are like, oh, my god, I can't wait till she finally gets married. Give me some grandkids. No, no, that's not my mom at all. But to add that after like the first time meeting them, and especially we just went to coffee once, like we've only been on one date. So did she get the feeling, I mean, cause I could see him talking to her, just be like, hey, do you want grandkids someday? That's cool. Yeah. But if he's like, how many Grandkids you want? Cause I'm about to do work. I'm getting ready to do work tonight with how she felt about it. Yes, that's okay. Exactly how I talk to her. But don't you think, I mean, one question like that, like it was enough to write him off. No, it was the second question that he asked my parents. The second, what else, what else did he ask your parents other than if they want grandkids? He, he asked my dad for permission to marry me. Shut up. That is not true. He had to have been joking. There's no way he did. He, he had to have been joking, though. No, my dad said he was serious. Are you sure your dad's reading it correctly? I can't imagine a guy being out, technically your second date at your birthday party and then asking your father for permission to marry you. I wish it had to happen, but it did. And is that why you sent him a text saying, I don't want to talk to you anymore? Yeah. Okay. By the way, I completely support that. If that, that's what I'd love to know if he was actually joking, though, wouldn't you? No, I, I mean, I trust my parents. Alright. Well, I'd like to ask him, and he's actually on the other line listening right now, so we can do that. Are you serious? Yes, I am. Uh, first of all, this is being blown way out. Of proportion. Way out of proportion. I was having an adult conversation with some adults about adult things. I don't know what to say right now. This whole situation is just confusing. Did you. It's really confusing to me, too, George. Did you ask her father if you could marry her? It was in the context of a fun conversation. And I was like, you know, I was just like, hey, man.

So I drove around the corner and then I decided to get out of the car to maybe look, look for the cat. Uh huh. I thought maybe the cat was like outside or around the area. Yeah.

I got like a broken arm and I got a couple broken ribs. Oh my God. You're lucky that that's it, dude. Yeah, I've been in the hospital cause that happened. So you were gonna call her back, but obviously you've had Other things going on right now. Yeah. Um, it's just, it's just been nuts dealing with all this stuff. Yeah. Oh, she knows that. I'm so glad you're okay. Yeah. We talked to her. It sounds like she doesn't have any idea that you got hit by a car looking for a cat. I, uh, I don't, I don't, I don't know. I've been in the hospital. I, I don't know what she knows. Oh, my God. I would feel so bad if I was Rachel. It was a, I played myself forever. Very nice of you to try to find her cat, though. I, I don't even, I, but I didn't find the cat. No, you didn't? No. He found a car instead. You definitely found a car. Hey, Josh. Uh huh.

What? No, that is not appropriate. 43. 43. Okay. Have you ever been divorced before? What? Yeah. Wait, what? Yeah, cool. Have you recently gone out on a date with a girl named Carol who's also divorced? What's going on here? Oh, god. Sorry, man. I don't know how much you know about our show, but have you ever heard a second date update? No. No. Okay. Well, what that is is it's where if you go out on a date with someone and then not call them back after they email us to see if we can get you on the phone and ask why. So Carol actually emailed us about you and she told us how you hired her to decorate your place and then you ended up taking her out for dinner and now you're not calling her back. Yeah, I mean, but you know, I don't feel like I should go into all that on the radio. Well, she actually kind of wants you to. Why? Because she liked you and she wants to know what the reason is. Did she do something wrong on the date? I mean, it was just, it was kind of strange and I don't know, probably embarrassing for her. So I really don't want to get into it. Oh, well, if you're saying that it's something that's gonna embarrass her, she's prepared to be embarrassed. I mean, she's the one that emailed us to do this. Segment. So yeah, but I mean, she told me I don't know if she would want me telling everybody who's listening to this. Well, that's kind of the deal when you do this. We tell you beforehand like you have to be willing to air whatever dirty laundry it is and you have to be willing to hear something that might be embarrassing. So she knows she's totally clueless. Uh, okay. All right. Well, yeah, I don't know how much she like told you about the date, but you know, we, we were talking and both of us had been divorced. So we were just talking about some of our experiences with that and uh, apparently she's had four different husbands. Whoa. Oh, that's a lot. She only, it's a lot. Yeah. Well, you know, I mean, she only told us about one divorce or at least made it sound like she only had one divorce. Yeah. Oh, no, no, no, no. Um, it's really, uh, okay. So yes, she has said she had four. Um, two of them were actually divorces. Okay. One of them, I mean, I swear this is how I remember it. She said that she doesn't actually know where he is. He's wait, he's missing like she, the words she actually used were missing in action and then like laughed about it. So wait, it's not, it wasn't like a legit military thing. I don't think so. I mean, she, if it was a military Thing. I don't think she would have laughed. I mean, she laughed like she didn't know where he is and she laughed about it. So isn't she like technically still married to him? I don't. I honestly, I didn't want to ask much beyond that. Um, but she had said that she had been married four times. So, you know, I was like, well, what about the last one? And she told me that he died. Did she laugh about that, too, or was that a sad moment for her? Yeah. No, she, she offered that. And, you know, so I was trying to be sympathetic. And she was sort of cavalier about that, too. She said that apparently they were in the Caribbean and he, he fell off of a hoverboard. What? Oh, my God. That is a crazy story. No, she did not kill these guys. Why are you thinking that? That is the most ridiculous conclusion.

We were supposed to leave for Italy the next morning. My husband's whole family was going, parents, siblings, everyone. This was supposed to be our dream vacation to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. I was so excited since I'd never been to Europe before. But my mother in law, Valerie, has always absolutely hated me. From day one, she's made it crystal clear that she thinks I'm not good enough for her precious son. She's made my life hell for the past three years with constant passive aggressive comments and deliberate exclusions from family events. The first part, my husband just stands there and lets it happen. He never defends me, never calls her out. It's like he's terrified of Mommy dearest. For weeks leading up to this trip, Valerie had been making little comments, oh, I hope everyone's paperwork is in order. It would be such a shame if someone couldn't make it last minute. These international trips are so complicated. I started getting paranoid, but I thought I was just being crazy. Then my coworker at the print shop jokingly said, you should make a fake passport just in case she tries something. We both laughed, but honestly, something about Valerie's behaviour had me worried. So the day before we left, I actually did it. I used our high end printers at Work to create a convincing fake passport. Same photo, same info, but completely bogus. I figured if Valerie was planning something, at least I'd be prepared. That morning I was in their kitchen finishing my packing when Valerie appeared. She had this weird gleam in her eyes that immediately put me on edge. You know what, Amanda? I'm done pretending to like you, she said suddenly, her voice dripping. I've been waiting three years for the perfect moment to get rid of you. Before I could even process what was happening, she lunged for my passport sitting on the counter. I tried to grab it, but she was faster. Oops, looks like you can't come to Italy after all, she said. With the most evil smirk I've ever seen. She pulled out her kitchen lighter and set the passport on fire right there in the sink. I watched it burn completely to ash while she stood there looking absolutely triumphant. Guess you'll have to stay home while we have the time of our lives in Rome, she taunted. That's when I started laughing, full on belly deep laugh.

My billionaire uncle taught me his trick when I turned 25 and inherited his pharmaceutical company. He said never let them see the real you first. Make them fall for broke you. So I created a fake dating profile as Mike, the struggling musician, posted photos in my crappiest clothes, mentioned my time, any studio apartment and ramen diet. I even got a part time job at Guitar Center to sell the story. I matched with Emma, who seemed perfect. She was studying to be a veterinarian, drove her mom's old Corolla and always suggested cheap date spots like food trucks and free concerts in the park. She'd split, put every Bill down to the penny, insisting she knew how tight money was for musicians. After three months, I was falling hard. She'd bring me homemade lunches to Guitar Center saying she made extra and didn't want it to go to waste. Never asked about my music career or pushed me to make it big. She just seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with Broke Mike. Then she started acting strange. She disappear for hours with vague excuses about studying at the library. She'd make secretive phone calls and step outside when I was around. Once I saw expensive designer shopping bags in her backseat that she quickly covered with a blanket when she noticed me looking. I was getting paranoid. Was she cheating? Was I just her bro boyfriend while she Had some rich guy on the side. I hired a private investigator thinking she was seeing someone else. The report came back with photos that made my jaw drop. Emma entering a massive mansion with a circular driveway. Emma stepping out of a brand new Tesla Model s. Emma in an evening gown shaking hands with the mayor at some charity gala. I was curious. Here I was pretending to be poor to avoid gold diggers while she was living this secret rich life and playing me for a fool. I confronted her at what I thought was her small apartment near campus. Turns out it was just the guest house on her family's estate. Emma, who the hell are you really? She looked terrified and broke down crying. My dad owns the largest chain of veterinary hospitals in the state. My family's worth over $200 million. But every guy I've dated since high school only wanted me to fund their business ideas or introduce them to my rich friends. She wiped her eyes, mascara running. I've been living in the guest house and driving Mom's old car because I wanted to meet someone who'd like me when they thought I had nothing. You're the first person who never asked me for money or tried to impress me with expensive plans you couldn't afford. She looked at my shocked face. Please don't hate me, Mike. I know I lied, but I was just so tired of guys seeing dollar signs instead Of me. That's when I started laughing hysterically. Emma, I need to tell you something about my pharmaceutical company. Her confused expression was priceless. Remember how I said I inherited some money from my uncle? Well, he didn't just leave me money. He left me the entire company. I'm worth about $800 million. We just stared at each other in this ridiculous guest house. Two rich people who'd been pretending to be broke because we were both terrified of being used. She started laughing, too. So you're telling me I've been buying you lunch because I thought you were struggling while you've been letting me pay because you thought I was a poor vet student. Pretty.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years, and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size, and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend, she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler, who said she was being a total bitch. I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my Fitness Pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee, With extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better, and she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

My 12 year old daughter Adeline takes the bus home from school every day. She's always been chatty about her day. But last week something changed. She started mentioning this nice man who always sits behind her and asks about her homework, her friends, what she likes to do after school. Red flags everywhere. At first I thought maybe she was just being friendly. But then Adeline said he'd complimented her hair and asked if she walked home alone from the bus stop. When she told me he knew which stop was hers, even though he never got off there, my stomach dropped. I decided to follow the bus route in my car the next afternoon. Sure enough, there's this guy in his 40s who gets on at the stop right after Adeline's school. He's not dressed like someone heading to work, no briefcase, no uniform, just sitting there in a baseball cap watching the kids. I followed the bus for three stops. He never got off, just rode it to the end of the route, then walked back to his car parked at the school. When Adeline told me he'd offered her candy and asked where exactly we lived, including what our house looks like, I knew I had to act fast. The next morning I called in sick to work and got on that bus myself, sat three rows behind him with sunglasses and a hoodie up. Adeline didn't even Notice me boarding? I watched him scan every kid getting on, but his eyes locked on Adeline the moment she stepped up those bus steps. He immediately moved to the seat directly behind her and started his routine. How was school today, sweetheart? Did you think about what I said yesterday about our little secret? Adeline looked uncomfortable but was trying to be polite. Um, I guess so. Good girl. Smart girls like you deserve special treats. Maybe we could meet up sometime when your parents aren't around. I know a place near your house where we could talk. That's when I stood up. Walk.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years and I was supposed to be her maid of honour. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I, I've gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler who said she was being a total bitch. I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my fitness pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting Coffee with extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better. And she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

My 14 year old daughter started asking to sleep over at friends houses every weekend. And I thought it was just normal teenage social stuff. But then I noticed the pattern. Every Monday morning she'd come home looking absolutely destroyed. Dark circles so deep they looked like bruises. Shoulders hunched, dragging her feet like each step hurt. When I asked about the sleepovers, she just mumbled it was fun and disappear into her room. Her math teacher emailed saying she had a panic attack during class when he'd casually asked about her weekend plans. Her violent teacher called to say she'd quit, just walked out mid lesson without explanation. She lost 10 pounds in just over a month. Her favorite jeans hung loose on her hips. She barely touched breakfast anymore. Started missing Sunday family dinners, events she'd never miss before, not even when she had the flu. My partner thought I was losing it. She's 14, Lisa. Girls have sleepovers. You're being paranoid. But when I was cleaning her room, I found energy drink cans stuffed behind her dresser, dozens of them. My sweet girl who used to drink nothing but herbal tea, my mom instincts weren't just whispering anymore, they were screaming. I started watching her more carefully. She'd get text on Friday afternoon and her whole body would change. Shoulders would tense up, face would go pale, hands would start trembling as she packed always the same overnight bag. But I Noticed something odd. Work gloves sticking out of the side pocket. No more family game nights on Saturdays. No more baking cookies together on Sunday mornings. No more asking me to braid her hair before bed. It was like she was being pulled away from us by some invisible force. One day I was passing her room when I heard her on the phone. Her voice was different, scared, desperate almost. I know, I know I'll be there, her voice cracked. I can't do this every weekend anymore. Please. A pause. No, I understand. I promise I won't tell anyone. Then I heard her crying. Real gut wrenching sobs that made my chest tighten. The next morning at breakfast, I asked casually, which friend's house are you going to tonight, honey? Her spoon clattered into her cereal bowl. Her eyes darted to her phone like it might save her. Just, just Marlene's. Her mom already said yes. But I called Marlene's mom last week. Marlene had been at her dad's house in another state for the past month. That's when I really started noticing her phone behavior. When a specific notification sound played, just two quick beeps, her entire body would go rigid. Then she'd immediately delete whatever she'd seen. Something was very, very wrong with my daughter. I waited until she left for her sleepover that Saturday night. Then I did something I'd sworn I'd never do. I followed her. She didn't walk like a teenager heading to a Fun sleepover. She walked like someone heading to their execution, taking a weird winding route through the neighborhood, doubling back twice, constantly checking over her shoulder. At one point, she stopped completely, stood under a streetlight, and I watched her take deep, shuddering breaths like she was preparing for battle. She pulled out her phone and typed something. Even from my car, I could see her hands shaking as she hit send. The response must have been immediate because her shoulders slumped in defeat. Then she kept walking. What I discovered made my stomach drop to the floor. She didn't go.

My 16 year old Sophie had been begging for AirPods Pro all summer, the new 300 dollar model. She'd researched every feature, watched countless unboxing videos, even created a detailed comparison chart showing why the Pro version was essential for her aesthetic. Her birthday arrived and I surprised her with the exact model. I was so proud finding them in stock when they'd been sold out everywhere. Her face dropped the second she opened the box. Um, these are the regular AirPods Pro. She held them like they were defective. I specifically said I need the AirPods Pro Max. Everyone at school has the Max version now. These make me look poor. The Max version. This kid wanted the $600 over ear headphones that cost more than my car payment. Her music career consisted of making 15 second TikTok dance videos to trending songs. The Pro version has the same sound quality, I explained, trying to salvage the moment. These are what actual musicians use for professional work. Mom, nobody cares about sound quality. It's about the look. These tiny earbuds are so basic. The max ones are a statement piece. She was already putting them back in the box. Can you just return these and get the right ones? It's only like 300 bucks more. Only 300 bucks more. Like I was made of money. That's stung deep. I'd specifically researched which model music professionals recommended. I'd read reviews, compared Features even asked my friend who works in audio production. I'll think about it, I said quietly, taking the box from her. She was already back on her phone. Thanks, mom. You're the best. Make sure you get the space gray ones, not silver. Silver looks cheap on camera. I just nodded and walked away. Next day, I'm at Apple Store standing in the return line, still feeling terrible about the whole situation. The line was moving slowly and I could hear the customer service conversation happening ahead of me. I'm sorry, ma'am, your card was declined again. Do you want to try a different payment method? I looked up from my phone. A woman about my age wearing scrubs with Maria embroidered on them was standing there with her teenage son. He couldn't have been older than 15, wearing a faded band T-shirt and holding her hand supportively. Um, let me try this one, Maria said, pulling out a different card. Her hands were shaking slightly. Sorry, Miguel. I thought I had enough after paying rent. This one declined too, the employee said gently. The boy immediately stepped forward. It's okay, mom. I don't really need new earbuds for school. My old ones still work fine for online classes. Maria's shoulders sagged like someone had just crushed her dreams. Miho, you've been using those broken earbuds for two years. The left one doesn't even work anymore. And you need them for your virtual music lessons. Maybe next month I'll Have better tips from work, she said, her voice cracking. Your music teacher said you have real talent. You deserve proper equipment. Mom, sharing one earbud with my study group is fine. Besides, my music sounds better when we listen to.

Like me and my friend could be in the most tense, awkward, silent room and all it takes is one look, just one glance, and it's over for us. I'm talking courtroom silence, funeral level seriousness. And somehow in that moment, your brain's like, what if I laughed right now for absolutely no reason? And suddenly you're fighting for your life, your stomach is shaking, your eyes are tearing up and you're doing that weird wheeze cough to hide it, like hoping nobody notices. And bro, your friend isn't helping. They got that stupid smirk, biting their lip, looking anywhere but at you. And now it's a battle of who breaks first. You start doing that dramatic exhale, like breathing through your nostrils is gonna save you. And it's never a situation where you can laugh. It's like during class when the teachers yelling at the whole room talking about this isn't funny, this is serious. And now you're in the back, like trying not to burst that laugh out, trying not to make eye contact. Cause you know once you do, it's over worse, your friend starts shaking, doing that shoulder bounce laugh that's silent. And then your laugh becomes 10 x funnier cause now you're both gasping for air but making no sound, just wheezing like broken vacuums. If someone asks what's so funny, you can't even answer cause There's nothing to explain. It's just pure forbidden laughter energy at the worst possible time. To this day, I don't know how I survived those moments. Shout out to my laugh partner. We risked our lives not to laugh out loud. Tag your laugh buddy, cause y'all know the struggle.

Um, so I was looking at his iPad because it's connected to his phone and I had to reset our home like security system and he keeps the code on there and his note section.

So I was like, hmm, maybe I'll take a quick peek see if he picked up on the many hints that I've been leaving. Um, so wait, so wait. So you snoop so you're a Christmas gift snooper then for shame.

So to your knowledge he doesn't have like a cousin staff or a sibling? It's not his mom's name or his grandma. No, no staff that I can think of at all. And I'm like, well, maybe this is Just a coworker or a good friend. But still like, is it even okay for a married man to buy be buying diamond earrings for a friend or a co worker? I mean, I mean, it kind of depends. So right. I mean, if it's somebody maybe they're retiring after many years of working with him or are the diamonds like teeny tiny cheapos? Listen, but even if they are, I don't know if a married man has any business buying diamond earrings for another woman for any reason. Has he ever bought you diamond earrings? Yeah, but many, many years ago. Okay, but see, he took care of his wife first then I don't know. I don't think there's any reason why a married man should be buying diamond earrings for another woman. See, that's exactly how I feel as well. So okay, what do you want us to do then Casey? I like to know who this staff person is and why he's buying her diamond earring. Okay. Well, I'm not sure if we can answer the second question, but we can definitely find out the more important one which who is this staff person and and I'm assuming we can call your husband. Yes, absolutely. Okay. And what is his name? I don't think you ever told us. It's John. John. Okay, so hang on a sec and then we'll get John's number from you and then we'll call him when we come back next. Hello. Hi. Can I speak to John, please? Can I ask who's calling? Sure. This is the Z Morning Zoo radio show on Z1 0, 4, Nick, Natalie and Shaggy. Is this John? It sure is. What's up, everybody? Not much. How are you this morning? I'm doing well. I'm doing real well, actually. Uh, you know, I feel a lot better if you're about to tell me I won something, though. Oh, yeah. Well, ha ha. I wish that was why you were calling. Actually, we've been doing something really special on our show this week called Sexy Secret Santa, and that's why we called you. Okay. So the way it works is if somebody's got like a special person in their lives and they're kind of like a secret, they call us and tell us to wish them a very sexy Christmas. Kinda lame, you know? I know. But listen, we got a call from Steph about you. I guess she said you were a very special person to her. So who is Steph?

Hi. Can I speak to Lisa, please? This is her. Hey, Lisa. How are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Um, hello. Hello. I'm calling you today because one of our listeners emailed us and asked us to get you on the phone. Really? Mm hmm. It's a segment that we do on our show called The 2nd Date Update. It's where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up blowing them off, they email us and ask us to get that person on the phone and ask why. So you recently went out on a date with somebody that listens to our show. Um, alright. His name is George. I think you would remember going on a date with George because you also invited him to your birthday party. Oh, yes, I did. Sounds like regret in your voice right there. Yeah. You have a second to talk to us about George? Yeah, I have a second. Um, fortunately, yeah. So he told us about how you guys met and he went to your birthday party. He thought everything went great. And then you sent him a text message saying you didn't want to talk to him anymore. Did he do something wrong? What? You know what? He was great with my friends, but the reactions at the end of the night were just not what I expected. Did your friends not like him? I thought it was Kind of a douche or something. It wasn't my friends who reacted about him. It was, it was my parents. Oh. Oh, your parents didn't like him? Yeah. Like really? Didn't like them at all. Really? Are they like really strict parents? No, they're not really overprotective. That's why it's weird that they didn't like this person. What did they say to you? Well, they told me he asked questions and they told me, he asked my mom, how many grandkids do you want? What? Yes. Was he joking? My mom said, I don't know. She didn't make it seem like he was joking. Was it in context, though, about something they were talking about? How long was he talking to your parents? He was talking to them for a long time. I think he was trying to impress them or something. But he was with them for a while before I got married. My mom would not really bring up grandkids, but some of them are like, oh, my god, I can't wait till she finally gets married. Give me some grandkids. No, no, that's not my mom at all. But to add that after like the first time meeting them, and especially we just went to coffee once, like, we've only been on one date. So did she get the feeling, I mean, cause I could see him talking to her, just being like, hey, do you want grandkids someday? That's cool. Yeah. But if he's like, how Many grandkids you want? Cause I'm about to do work. I'm getting ready to do work tonight with how she felt about it. Yes, that's okay. Exactly how I talk to her. But don't you think, I mean, one question like that, like it was enough to write him off? No, it was the second question that he asked my parents. The second, what else, what else did he ask your parents other than if they want grandkids? He, he asked my dad for permission to marry me. Shut up. That is not true. He had to have been joking. There's no way he did. He, he had to have been joking, though. No, my dad said he was serious. Are you sure your dad's reading it correctly? I can't imagine a guy being out, technically your second date at your birthday party and then asking your father for permission to marry you. I wish it had to happen, but it did. And is that why you sent him a text saying, I don't want to talk to you anymore? Yeah. Okay. By the way, I completely support that. If that, I'd love to know if he was actually joking, though, wouldn't you? No, I, I mean, I trust my parents. Alright. Well, I'd like to ask him, and he's actually on the other line listening right now, so we can do that. Are you serious? Yes, I am. Uh, first of all, this is being blown way out of Proportion, way out of proportion. I was having an adult conversation with some adults about adult things. I don't know what to say right now. This whole situation is just confusing. Did you. It's really confusing to me, too, George. Did you ask her father if you could marry her? It was in the context of a fun conversation. And I was like, you know, I was just like, hey, man.

I was the first person in my family to go to college. My dad worked construction, my mom cleaned houses, and my little brother Jake gave up his bedroom so I could have a quiet space to study. When I got my acceptance letter to State University, I ran through the house screaming that I got a full scholarship. I didn't. I got partial aid that covered about 60%. The rest would be $28,000. My first year alone. Stood in the financial aid office staring at those numbers, knowing my parents would take out loans they couldn't afford, or call every distant relative begging for help. They'd already sacrificed so much. I walked to the student loan office down the hall and signed papers for a private loan. I told myself I'd pay it back on my own after graduation. Easy. The first payment came due six months later, while I was still in school. $240 a month. I got a job shelving books at the campus library for $8 an hour, and picked up tutoring sessions for kids who struggled with math. Between classes, I'd run to work. Between work, I tutor until midnight. My parents called every Sunday asking how my scholarship was going. I told them it was great. My mom would cry happy tears, talking about how proud she was that her smart daughter got everything paid for. Every month I made that payment. Sometimes I'd eat nothing but ramen. Noodles for three weeks straight. When my roommates went out for pizza, I'd say I wasn't hungry. When they asked why I worked so many hours with a full ride, I joked that I was saving up for something special. By graduation, the debt had grown to $53,000. Interest kept piling on top of interest. I still said nothing. I got a job in marketing in Chicago and moved to the smallest studio apartment I could find. It it was basically a closet with a hot plate, but rent was only 800 a month. My parents visited once and asked why I lived somewhere so tiny when I made decent money. I told them I was being responsible and saving for a house. Really? I was drowning. Every single month I transfer money to that loan. I walked 40 minutes to work instead of taking the bus. I bought clothes from thrift stores and told people I was into vintage fashion. I never went to movies or bars. When co workers invited me out, I'd make excuses about being tired or having plans. My friends thought I was incredibly disciplined. They joke about my monk like lifestyle and ask for budgeting advice. If only they knew I was living on peanut butter sandwiches and splitting single meals into two days of food. The worst part was lying to my family. When Jake started applying to colleges, he'd call asking for advice about scholarships. I'd help him with applications while knowing His chances were slim. When my parents mentioned how expensive college was getting, I'd nod and agree while making another payment on my secret debt. Five years passed.

Yeah, she was really complimentary. That's really nice. I mean, we had a lot of fun. It was a fun time. So you liked it? So she was fun. Are you not attracted to her? Is that the issue? No, I would she's cute. I like her, but it's just not gonna work out. Okay. Well, why if she's cute and you had fun, that sounds awful. Is that a problem? You don't like that? No, I really like that. It's just she lied. She lied. Whoa. About what? Uh, actually, let me rephrase that. She wasn't 100% truthful with me. Okay. Okay. Who is on a first date? Let's be honest. Well, yeah, but I mean, this is kind of an important thing that she wasn't very truthful about. What was it? Well, she said her name was Stephanie on Tinder. Okay. Okay. And then when we met, it was revealed that her name is summer. So she uses a different name on Tinder. Yeah. Well, No. 1, I don't know why someone would do that, but I, I can think of a lot of reasons. Maybe she's got a crazy ex or she doesn't want people to know or She just want her job to be able to search her on Tinder. Okay. I mean, nonetheless, I'd still wouldn't work out why? Why is that a big deal? Yeah. Well, yeah, our name is summer. Our name is summer. Okay. My last name is pants. And if, uh, yeah, if we were to, I don't know, like long term relationship get married at some point, her name would be Summer Pants. Come on. That that is the dumbest. I think that's amazing. Yeah, I, I would love that. Well, I would not love that. It make me very uncomfortable knowing maybe people are making fun of her behind her back or something like that. Oh my God. You jumped so many steps by the way. Well, I know I'm going fast, but I'm looking for a long term relationship. So I'm not there to just mess around with people. And so, so you're looking for a forever pants. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hey, don't get smarty pants and you okay. You don't feel like somebody with the name Summer Pants would be the person that you want to be around all the time. No, it's just a little too awkward. Okay. But you are so many assumptions here. One that she would even take your name when you got married. Like a lot of women keep their last name and that's fine. No, I come kind of from a more traditional point of view. So you want whoever you marry To take your last name. Yeah, I do. Even though it's an awkward life to live with the last name pants. I know it is. I'm living it. But you're Daniel Pants and you don't think summer pants would be a good partner for you? No, I just couldn't do that to her. Okay. Well, and that's it. That's the only reason. That is the biggest reason. Yes. That is so ridiculous to me. Yes. You could be missing out on the love of your life because of it. Silly thing and years of great jokes. Yeah. That's a problem for me. I don't want my wife's name to be a joke. I just want us to be a happy family of pants. See, now you're making jokes about your own last name, so you can't really judge. No, I'm allowed to. Okay. You're allowed to. Well, Daniel, I do have to let you know that summer is on the phone listening right now and she wants to talk to you. What? Yeah.

No problem. Okay. I love it. Love it. Any girl with brown hair? Save the number. Yeah, nice girl with brown hair. If you're just tuning in, Adam is about to make a very awkward phone call. He wants to call a girl that he's gone on two dates with. What's her name by the way? I didn't get that from you. Tony. Tony. Okay, so he and Tony have been on two dates and he's about to call her and ask her if she will marry him. Oh my god. I mean, usually that is something romantic that we set up. This is so far from romance. This is like anti romantic, right? The reason that he needs to do it is his grandmother is very wealthy and she put in her will that he has to marry someone while she's still around and be married for a year and he'll get over $1 million. The grandmother even had like a checklist of what this person must be like. So he went out on a date with a girl who matches that criteria and he wants to call her and see if she'll marry him so that they can both get paid. It's so crazy when you say it. I mean, but why her? Why not just set up some advertisement? Somewhere it explains all the rules and details of this and literally just do a business deal with somebody. Oh, I mean, yeah, I could do that but I actually think I like this girl and I think that you know, maybe I do see a future I just have to speed things up a little bit. I think you should include those words in your proposal. Yeah, they're really romantic. I think so. Alright, well, I'm gonna dial her phone number and let you make your phone call. Good luck. Thank you. Hello. Hey, Tony, it's Adam. Oh, hey, how's it going? Good. Is this a good time to talk? Yeah, I can talk. So how's your day? You're having a good day today? Yeah, I'm having a great day. Thanks for asking. How, how's your day going? So good, great day. Really good day. Um, what are you doing tonight? I was just gonna do hot yoga and then go home. Oh my God. I love how you're doing nothing. I haven't been doing it for a while but whenever I do it it's great. Um, I'm sorry I'm being awkward. It's because there's something I want to talk to you about and I'm, I feel like I'm so awkward right now over it. Oh, uh, what's going on? Um, so like, you know, we've been on a couple dates and it's been great right? Really good time. Yeah, I mean, I feel like We hit it off pretty well. Um, so I know it's maybe like doing this over the phone is kind of weird, but I guess that what I was kind of curious was like, do you, have you ever thought about like marriage? Uh, what, what, what are you asking me? What about like, I mean, like, do you see yourself getting married at any point? Uh, like ever or an either or? I mean, like sooner than later, let's say. Oh man, why are you asking me about that? Um, I know this is gonna sound so crazy and I know it's probably gonna catch you way off guard and I don't even know what I'm doing, but I, oh my God. Are you going to ask me to marry you? Is that what this is? Um, yeah, I guess I am. Oh my God. You sucked it too. What? Oh my God. This is it. This is, wait, what? Oh my, yes, yeah, yes. Oh my God. I have to call my friends, my mother, my grandmother. Oh my God. This is amazing. This is amazing. Oh my gosh. What? Yeah, huh? What? What? What? Um, you're excited? Yes, yes, I'm excited. I knew there was a connection, just like I knew you liked me, but you like really?

I found out men treat fridges like treasure hunts. He'll open it five times in a row, stare like something new is going to spawn, sigh dramatically, and then eat plain cheese straight from the block. I once asked why he keeps checking. He said, in case a snack magically appears. Three, I didn't know guys hum to themselves during the most random tasks. My boyfriend will be cleaning the sink, humming what sounds like boss battle music, then suddenly switch to singing about how this sponge is my sword. I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said, but it still smells like me, so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said, because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6, 10. They make sound effects for everything, opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7, they'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8, they'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes. And apparently that's normal to them. 9, they'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car, groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10, they can sit in total silence for an hour staring at the wall. And when you ask what they're thinking about, they say nothing. And somehow they really mean nothing.

Then start reposting some of them. Like I'll come across a video of a father and daughter and be like huh, that could be me and my dad if he didn't leave. Then I'll come across one of those top 10 funniest moments on the Kevin Lang Show and I'm there cracking up trying to hold in my laugh so I don't wake anyone up. Then suddenly I come across one of those gym motivation videos yelling at me through the screen you want to be known as lazy your whole life? And I'll be taking it serious, thinking hell no. Then they say drop down and do 10 push UPS. I do, but my noodle alarms are so weak I can't even do one. So the walk of shame. Climbing back in my bed. But no, the adrenaline is still there. I set an alarm at 6 am to go for a run, so then I decide to go sleep. Suddenly I'm hit with the most embarrassing memories flooding my head. Every move shifts to a Different one. My brain is practically telling me, ha! Remember this, you fucking loser? Eventually, I fall asleep, then wake up from the fuck ass alarm I set and be like, who the heck did I think I was?

My mom would go through my backpack every single day when I got home from school, checking my homework like I was in third grade. She'd read my text messages whenever she felt like it, and if I complained, she'd take my phone away for a week. My dad wasn't much better. He had this rule where I couldn't leave the house after six PM, even on weekends. If I wanted to hang out with friends, I had to give them a full essay about where I was going, who would be there, and when I'd be back. The final straw was when they installed one of those tracking apps on my phone without telling me. I only found out because my friend Jake mentioned seeing my location pop up when he was trying to text me. I confronted them about it that night, and my mom just shrugged and said it was for my safety. My dad backed her up, saying as long as I lived under their roof, I followed their rules. Been working at this pizza place since I turned 16, saving up every paycheck except for what I needed for gas and lunch money. By the time I graduated high school, I had almost $4,000 saved up. I started looking at apartments online during my lunch breaks, telling myself I was just browsing. But the More I thought about it, the more I realized I could actually do this. Found this tiny studio apartment about 20 minutes from my job. The rent was only 600 a month, and the landlord said if I could prove I had a steady income and pay first month plus deposit, he'd rent to me. I went to look at it on a day my parents thought I was at work. It was small and kind of dingy, but it was mine. I filled out the application that same day. Two weeks later, he called and said I was approved. I could move in the following weekend. That's when it hit me that I was actually doing this. I felt sick to my stomach, but also kind of excited. I started slowly moving my stuff out. Every day after work, I'd grab a backpack full of clothes or books and stash them in my car. Told my parents I was staying late to help close the restaurant, which wasn't totally a lie, since I was picking up extra shifts to make sure I could afford everything. The hardest part was getting my bigger stuff out. I waited until they went to my aunt's house for Sunday dinner, something I'd gotten out of by saying I had to work. I loaded up my car with my dresser, my desk, and my TV. Left most of the furniture since it wasn't really mine anyway, but I took the stuff that mattered. I Left them a note on the kitchen counter. I kept it simple. Told them I'd moved out, that I was safe, and that I'd call them in a few days when I was settled. I said I needed space to figure out who I was as an adult and that I hoped they'd understand eventually. I left my house key next to the note. My phone started blowing up around 8 that night. Missed calls, texts, voicemails. My mom was crying, and half of them my dad was yelling in the others. They wanted to know where I was, if I was okay, why I didn't talk to them first. They said they'd always supported me and couldn't understand why I do this to them. Turn my phone off and didn't turn it back on until the next morning. I had 37 missed calls and way too many texts to read through. I called them back and told them I was fine. Gave them my address and said they could come see my place if they wanted. My mom showed up.

Every Sunday for 15 years, my grandmother made the same announcement at family dinner. When I pass away, everything goes to whoever visits me most. She tap her cane on the floor and smile like she just revealed state secrets. This turned my entire extended family into vultures. My Aunt Rachel drove three hours every Tuesday just to vacuum Grandma's living room. Uncle Steve called twice daily asking about her arthritis. My cousin Jennifer moved back from California and started doing Grandma's grocery shopping. They all hated each other but pretended to be saints around her. Meanwhile, I was banned from inheritance discussion. I liked guys and chicken nuggets, and grandma made it crystal clear that sinners don't deserve family money. She'd change the subject whenever I entered rooms. My cousins would smirk and whisper about how I'd be working at McDonald's while they lived in luxury. But here's what none of them knew. I actually loved spending time with grandma. Not for money. She'd already told me I wasn't getting any, but because she was genuinely funny. When she wasn't performing for the Inheritance Hunters, while they argued over who deserved what, I'd sneak over on Wednesday nights to watch old movies and eat ice cream. Grandma would relax completely. When it was just us, she'd tell dinosaurs jokes from the two thousand BC and complain about how fake everyone was being. She even started Asking about my boyfriend and seemed genuinely interested in our relationship. Never mentioned these visits to anyone because I knew they'd think I was scheming. After she passed last year, the whole family gathered for the will reading. Rachel brought a calculator. Steve wore his funeral suit from 1995. Jennifer had already started planning her European vacation. They were practically drooling as the lawyer opened the envelope.

After watching my dad hit my mom for years, I finally hit him back and ended up in a psych ward. They classified me as violent. So I spent 7 months in a white room with nothing but my thoughts. When I was finally released, all I wanted was a family of my own, one built on love, not fear. That's how I met Noah. He was 6, living in a group home after being removed from his fourth foster placement. The social worker warned me he was challenging, code for traumatized. But when I saw him sitting alone, methodically lining up broken crayons by size, something in my heart cracked open. I sat down beside him and asked what he was drawing. Without looking up, he said a house with no yelling. I noticed burn marks on his arms, perfectly circular cigarette burns. I had similar scars, only mine were from my dad's cigars. The first few weeks were rough. Noah tested every boundary, waiting for me to snap. He'd break things, scream that he hated me, try to run away. But I never raised my voice, never threatened, never hit. Instead, I'd sit with him during his meltdowns, speaking softly until his breathing steadied. One night, I found him in the kitchen at 3 a. M. Stuffing cereal into his pockets. I'm not mad, I said, keeping my distance. But can you tell me why his voice was barely A whisper in case you change your mind about me. Like everyone else, I opened the pantry, showing him the extra shelves I'd installed. This is your food, too. You'll never go hungry here, I promise. Slowly, things improved. He started sleeping through the night, stopped hoarding food, called me dad for the first time after I spent hours helping him build a blanket fort. Then he showed up at our door claiming he changed, found god wanted his son. Noah hid under his bed when he heard that voice, shaking so hard the frame rattled. The custody battle was brutal. His father had family money, hired expensive lawyers. They painted me as unstable because of my psych ward. Stay said a single man couldn't properly raise a traumatized child. But Noah's therapist testified about his progress. His teachers described his transformation from a silent, scared kid to an engaged student who helped younger children. The judge listened. The final hearing was yesterday. Noah squeezed my hand so tight it hurt as his father made one last plea. Then the judge looked at Noah and asked what he wanted. He stood up straight, looked his birth father in the eye and said, I already have a dad, the kind who builds forts and doesn't hurt people. Walking out of that courthouse, adoption papers finally signed no. It turned to me, can we get ice cream? Of course, buddy. Dad. Those other foster homes, they said I was too broken. That No one would want to keep me. I knelt down, meeting his eyes. You were never broken. You were waiting for someone who understood. At night, I heard him crying in his room. When I checked on him, he was organizing his crayons again. But this time, he was drawing our house with both of us inside, smiling. See, he said, pointing, no yelling. Now, whenever Noah has a hard day, we build a fort.

So my daughter Emma is 15 and has been dating this kid, Noah, for about four months now. Every time they go out, Noah pays movies, dinner, ice cream, even when Emma wants to grab something from the gas station. At first I figured, whatever, teenage boys like to show off. But then I started hearing conversations between Emma and my wife where my wife would literally say things like, oh, honey, that's so sweet. He's such a gentleman and you should never have to pay when you're with a boy. Last week was when it really hit me. Emma comes home talking about how Noah spent 40 bucks taking her to some fancy burger place downtown. I asked her if she offered to split it. And she looked at me like I had three heads. She goes, dad, why would I do that? Mom says boys are supposed to pay for dates. I confronted my wife about it that night and she got all defensive, started going on about how it's traditional and romantic and how Noah's family has money anyway, so it's fine. I told her she's basically teaching our daughter to be a gold digger. And that shut down the conversation real quick. But it kept happening. Emma would come home bragging about expensive stuff Noah bought her a new phone case. Some jewelry, taking her to the movies every weekend. The kid was probably spending his entire part time job paycheck on my daughter. Things got really bad when Emma mentioned wanting to go to homecoming. She starts talking about the dress she wants, which costs like $200, casually mentions that Noah said he'd buy it for her along with paying for dinner in the limo. I asked her how much all of that would cost and she just shrugged and said, I don't know. That's Noah's problem. That's when I lost it. I sat both Emma and my wife down and told them this had to stop. I explained that Noah is a 16 year old kid working at a grocery store making minimum wage, not some sugar daddy. Emma got all upset and said I was being mean and that all her friends, boyfriends pay for everything, too. My wife backed her up saying I was being old fashioned and that it's normal for boys to want to spoil their girlfriends. I told them both they were living in fantasy land and that Emma needed to start contributing to dates or I'd have a conversation with Noah's parents about what was happening. The whole thing came to a head when Noah's mom called me last week. Turns out the poor kid had been stressed about money and finally told his parents he was spending everything he earned on Emma. His mom was really nice about it, but.

Did it ever come back to bite your parents? So my older sister, Sarah, was the star. She was a genius, a violin player and basically collected awards. I was also there. The biggest example was my 10th birthday. I woke up so excited. It's the big 1:00. I went downstairs and my parents were rushing around making a big breakfast. My dad ruffled my hair and said, big day today, champ. I was beaming. Then he handed me a poster and a marker pen. It said, go, Sarah, good luck at the state finals. It was for her academic decathlon. The breakfast was for her. My mom didn't even say happy birthday. She just told me not to get any syrup on Sarah's lucky blazer. I spent the whole day in the stands holding the poster while they cheered for her. When we got home, I thought maybe there'd be a surprise and there was a cake in the fridge. Felt a rush of relief. But when my mom pulled it out, it was a small cupcake with a single candle. She lit it and gave it to Sarah. I asked why. My mom said, for good luck on her final question tomorrow. Make a wish, sweetie. They completely, totally forgot. I went to bed that night having not heard the words happy birthday once. A few years went by and things stayed pretty much the same. Sarah was getting acceptance letters from colleges. And my parents were already planning to frame them. One evening, my dad brings out this old dusty shoebox from the top of his closet. He gets all excited and says, remember this, our family memory box. We all put something in here on New Year's Day, the year you turned 10. He remembered the box, but not the day we made it. He opens it up and my mom starts pulling things out. There was Sarah's first place ribbon from that same academic decathlon. There was a newspaper clipping about the local weather. There was a little note my mom wrote about her hopes for the New Year. Then my dad pulled out the last thing. It was a cheap plastic wrapped DVD. On the front, in my dad's own handwriting, it said, Alex's 10th birthday surprise. Do not watch until dinner. It was a home movie he had made for me. He had spent weeks interviewing all my friends and family, asking for their favourite memories of me. It was all meant to be a big surprise for my birthday dinner, the one we never had. The room went completely silent. My mom just stared at the DVD in his hand. My dad slowly looked at me, then at the box.

It started when we were kids. Didn't matter where we were, grocery store, gas station, school parking lot, one of us would shout, last one to the car is a loser. And it was on. No warning, no mercy, full sprint. We treated it like the Olympics. If you tripped, too bad. If you had a backpack on, sucks to be you. The car was the finish line and victory tasted like smug laughter and sibling pride. I had more wins, but only barely. My sister was scrappy. She once dove over the hood just to beat me by half a second. Our parents hated it. You're gonna dent the car, someone's gonna get run over. But they always smiled when they said it. Deep down, I think they liked seeing us act like idiots. We kept it going even as we got older. At 13, it was still funny. At 16, it was nostalgic. Even at 19, when we were both back from our first semesters of college, we did it in the target parking lot. I won that one, but only because she tripped over her own shoelace. She laughed the whole way to the passenger seat, flipping me off with both hands. It became our thing, a weird little tradition only we cared about no matter what, holidays, weekend trips, even funerals. Once we found a moment for it, it was like a way to say I still see you without actually saying it. Then I guess it just faded. I didn't notice it at first. One afternoon we came out of a movie theater and I instinctively yelled it. She just smiled, shook her head and walked to the car. I figured she was tired. Another time I tried it at the mall, she waved me off. You win, she said, already unlocking the door. It didn't hit me as weird until a few months later. We were at our cousin's wedding. The whole family was.

Just calling you to see how you're doing today, trying to recruit new listeners to the show. Is that really what you're doing? No, just probably after we tell you why we are calling, you might never want to hear from us ever again. Don't be so pessimistic. This could be great. This could be a great call for you, Jason. All right, so, uh, just let me know what's going on. Like, I'm kind of interested now. Oh, good. Okay, well, we do a segment on our show called The Second Date Update. That's where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up not calling them back after, they can email us to get you on the phone and see if we can figure out what happened. And we got an email from a girl named  Colleen  okay, yeah, and  Colleen  told us all about your date. She said that you met through a friend of hers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And she said that she had a really good time, but it's been over a week now, and she's heard nothing from you. Is that true? Yeah. Um, yeah. Okay, so can you tell us why? Yeah, I don't know if I Have, like, enough time for that? I mean, might be a little, you know. So it's not just you've been busy and you haven't had time to get back to her? I mean, if you want to tell her that. Okay, well, if it's a lie, I don't want to tell her that. Is there a particular reason? Like, did she do something wrong? No, no, she was awesome. I mean. Okay, I'm really into her. I mean, stop that, you know? Yeah. Wait, usually when you're really into somebody, you don't call them back after a really awesome date. You don't know my situation, right? I know. I'm trying to find out your situation. I'm trying to see if I can help you out, actually. Hold up, Jason, are you in a relationship? No, no, no, I'm not in a relationship right now. I'm single. Okay, so wait, why would you not call someone back that's awesome and that you're really into? Um, it's really complicated right now, and I just don't want to really talk about it. Okay, well, can you tell us anything? Because here's the thing, though. She really liked you, and from the sounds of it, you really liked her. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I really do. And, like, I. I will get in touch with her. Right. But I'm telling you right now, though, if you wait too long, that ship's gonna sail. Cause she actually did tell us that. It's been so long. Since she's heard from me that she's just thinking about cutting it and not even trying anymore. Yeah, she doesn't wanna spend her days thinking about some guy that's not thinking about her. Like, that's. You have to understand that she doesn't wanna waste her time. Uh, look, I really fucked up. And, uh. And I. Yeah. Okay. Well, can you tell us what happened? Yeah. All right. Just. You're not gonna tell her? No. We'll tell her something else if it's that bad. Yeah. Like, I want you guys to go out again cause you both liked each other.

I live with this guy Brett who thinks he's way smarter than everyone else. he's the type of dude who corrects people's grammar in group chats and always has to one up whatever story you're telling. The problem started when I got this new job at a warehouse that starts stupid early. I'm talking 5:00am shifts, which means my alarm goes off at 4:45. Now. Brett works from home doing some tech thing and doesn't wake up until like 10. So you think this wouldn't affect him at all since his room is on the other side of our apartment? But no. This guy starts complaining after my second day. Says my alarm is too loud and it's disrupting his precious sleep schedule. I'm like dude, it's literally three beeps and I turn it off immediately. Plus your room is down the hall with the door closed. He keeps whining about it for like two weeks. Even left me this passive aggressive note on the fridge about being considerate of roommates and proper sleep hygiene. The note was color coded. Who does that? Then I noticed something weird. Every morning when my alarm went off I'd hear this mad scrambling from his room followed by his door slamming and the shower turning on. At first I thought maybe he was just getting up to pee or whatever, but it happened Every single day at the exact same time. One morning, I was running late and forgot to grab my coffee mug from the kitchen. I went back to get it. I saw Brett's bathroom door was cracked open, and he was just standing there in the shower, fully clothed, scrolling through his phone. Not even wet, just standing there like an idiot. That's when it clicked. This dude was sprinting to the bathroom every morning to block me from using the shower. See, we only have one bathroom, and he knew I needed to shower before work. He figured if he got there first, I'd be late and eventually have to change my schedule or find a new job or whatever. The thing is, I had been showering at night specifically because I knew mornings would be rushed. I didn't even need the bathroom. But Brett's big brain assumed I'd have to shower in the morning like a normal person. So this guy had been jolting awake at 4:45 a m. Every day for two weeks, running across the apartment in his underwear, and then standing in a cold shower for 30 minutes just to spite me. Meanwhile, I'm getting ready in my room. Completely unaware of his master plan, I decided to have some fun with it. Started setting my alarm five minutes earlier each day just to see how far I could push it. By the end of the week, Brett was speed walking to the bathroom at 4:25 a m, and I could hear him shivering in there because he was too proud to turn on the hot water and give away his scheme. The best part was when he finally cracked

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We've known each other since freshman year, and when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything fifty fifty, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back, thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird, serious face she starts with. So I've been thinking, and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself, and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. But she's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue, because, honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I tell her, fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved, like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything, and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realize I bought literally everything that makes it nice. The 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine. The leather couch we're always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff, like my clothes and my desk. I unplugged the TV and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target, and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realized she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing. That

So I drove him straight into another state while he slept. Mr Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper, just throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he'd always had his favorite line. In the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into driver's ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my, it dropped like a stone. Where do I turn, I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise, though with your steering. Straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchange looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight with you girls. Never know when we're Gonna stop or if we're gonna stop. By the third lesson we discovered his pattern. He'd make his nasty jokes for 20 minutes then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practice highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed. He's when I've beard slightly, I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife if we survive today's lesson. That is 3 teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon Sophia slightly veered and he exploded. Jesus, are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high and why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My 5 year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I and then he was snoring head tilted back against the headrest, looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realized he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up on the right And I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five North hanging over the highway. Like a dare, I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering. I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added, me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank, then back at the sleeping Mister Maya. And as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. Thirty minutes passed, then an hour and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up constantly with white.

My 16 year old Sophie had been begging for AirPods Pro all summer, the new 300 dollar model. She'd researched every feature, watched countless unboxing videos, even created a detailed comparison chart showing why the Pro version was essential for her aesthetic. Her birthday arrived and I surprised her with the exact model. I was so proud finding them in stock when they'd been sold out everywhere. Her face dropped the second she opened the box. Um, these are the regular AirPods Pro. She held them like they were defective. I specifically said I need the AirPods Pro Max. Everyone at school has the Max version now. These make me look poor. The Max version. This kid wanted the $600 over ear headphones that cost more than my car payment. Her music career consisted of making 15 second TikTok dance videos to trending songs. The Pro version has the same sound quality, I explained, trying to salvage the moment. These are what actual musicians use for professional work. Mom, nobody cares about sound quality. It's about the look. These tiny earbuds are so basic. The max ones are a statement piece. She was already putting them back in the box. Can you just return these and get the right ones? It's only like 300 bucks more. Only 300 bucks more. Like I was made of money. That's stung deep. I'd specifically researched which model music professionals recommended. I'd read reviews, compared Features even asked my friend who works in audio production. I'll think about it, I said quietly, taking the box from her. She was already back on her phone. Thanks, mom. You're the best. Make sure you get the space gray ones, not silver. Silver looks cheap on camera. I just nodded and walked away. Next day, I'm at Apple Store standing in the return line, still feeling terrible about the whole situation. The line was moving slowly and I could hear the customer service conversation happening ahead of me. I'm sorry, ma'am, your card was declined again. Do you want to try a different payment method? I looked up from my phone. A woman about my age wearing scrubs with Maria embroidered on them was standing there with her teenage son. He couldn't have been older than 15, wearing a faded band T-shirt and holding her hand supportively. Um, let me try this one, Maria said, pulling out a different card. Her hands were shaking slightly. Sorry, Miguel. I thought I had enough after paying rent. This one declined too, the employee said gently. The boy immediately stepped forward. It's okay, mom. I don't really need new earbuds for school. My old ones still work fine for online classes. Maria's shoulders sagged like someone had just crushed her dreams. Miho, you've been using those broken earbuds for two years. The left one doesn't even work anymore. And you need them for your virtual music lessons. Maybe next month I'll Have better tips from work, she said, her voice cracking. Your music teacher said you have real talent. You deserve proper equipment. Mom, sharing one earbud with my study group is fine. Besides, my music sounds better when we listen to.

I paid for this so I'm keeping it moment. My ex wife Emma thought she was so clever during our divorce. We've been married eight years and when things went south, she hired this shark lawyer who promised to take me for everything I had. The divorce was brutal. She wanted the house, both cars, half my business and spousal support. Her lawyer kept saying I was hiding assets and demanded access to all my financial records going back five years. But there was one thing Emma really wanted, my signed Jersey collection. I've been collecting them since high school. Mickey Mantle, Joe Montana, Michael Jordan, worth about $30,000 total. Emma hated that collection, always called it my stupid sports shrine and said it was a waste of money. But now that we were splitting up, suddenly she wanted half of everything, including jerseys she'd mocked for years. Her lawyer argued that since we bought some of them during the marriage, she was entitled to 50% of the collection. The Mickey Mantle alone was worth 12 grand. I tried explaining that most of these were gifts for my dad or things I'd saved up for with my own money before we even met. Didn't matter. Her lawyer wanted receipts for everything. So I spent weeks digging through old boxes, finding every receipt, every certificate of authenticity, every piece of paper that proved when and how I got each Jersey. That's when I found something interesting, the Michael Jordan Jersey, the crown jewel of my collection, worth $15,000. I had the original receipt from 2019, but it wasn't purchased by me. It was purchased by Emma as a surprise for my 40th birthday. She'd spent months tracking it down through collectors, paid full price, even had it professionally framed. I'll never forget her face when my lawyer presented that receipt in court. She went completely white as he explained that according to her own legal argument, she just proved the most valuable item in my collection legally belonged to her. Her lawyer tried to backtrack, saying it was a gift and gifts don't count. But my lawyer was ready. He pulled out the divorce papers where Emma's team had specifically argued that the source of payment determined ownership, not the intent. The judge looked annoyed. He asked Emma's lawyer if they wanted to change their legal strategy, which would mean starting the entire asset division process over again. That would cost them another six months and 20,000 in legal fees. Emma was trapped by her own greed. If she backed down, she'd lose her claim to everything else. If she pushed forward, she'd have to give me the Jordan Jersey. While fighting for jerseys worth half as much, her lawyer whispered something in her ear. She shook her head violently. They whispered more. Finally, she slumped back in her chair, looking defeated. Fine, she said through gritted teeth. He can keep his stupid jerseys. But I wasn't done. I Stood up and addressed the judge directly. I'd like to make a counter offer regarding the Michael Jordan Jersey. Everyone looked confused. My own lawyer didn't know what I was planning. According to the receipt, my ex wife purchased this Jersey. According to her legal argument, that makes it hers. I don't want to take something that doesn't belong to me. Emma's eyes lit up. She thought I was giving her a 15 thousand dollar dollar victory. However, I continued. I'd like to.

I was 12 when a man in a blue pickup truck pulled up next to me while I was walking home from school. He asked if I wanted to earn $20 helping him move boxes. My parents had always warned me about strangers, but $20 seems like a fortune to a kid who got $5 allowance. The moment I got in his truck, I knew I'd made a terrible mistake. He immediately locked the doors and started driving in the opposite direction of where he said we were going. When I asked where we were headed, he told me to shut up and sit still. He drove for what felt like hours to a small cabin in the woods. No neighbours, no cell towers, nothing but trees. He dragged me inside and tied me to a chair and what looked like a basement. The smell was awful, like something had died down there. For the first two days, he barely spoke to me except to bring stale bread and warm water. I cried constantly, begging him to let me go home. He just stared at me with these cold, empty eyes and said my parents probably hadn't even noticed I was gone yet. On the third day, he made a mistake. He left his phone on the table while he went upstairs to make himself lunch. I, I could hear him moving around in the kitchen above me, the rope around my Wrists had loosened slightly from struggling and I managed to work one hand free. I grabbed his phone and called the first number I could think of, my mom's work number that she'd made me memorize for emergencies. When she answered, I whispered as quietly as I could, mom, I've been kidnapped. I'm in a cabin somewhere. There are tall pine trees everywhere and I can hear a train in the distance. Before I could say more, I heard his footsteps coming down the stairs. I quickly put the phone back and got my hand back in the rope just as he appeared. He looked at me suspiciously but didn't seem to notice anything different. What I didn't know was that my mom had immediately called the police. While staying on the line, they traced the call and started searching for cabins near train tracks in our area. Meanwhile, she kept calling his phone every few minutes, hoping I'd answer. The next morning, he seemed agitated, kept looking out the windows and pacing around the cabin. I realised later that police helicopters had been circling the area, getting closer to finding us. He started talking about moving me somewhere else, which terrified me. That afternoon, he went outside to load something into his truck. I heard him talking to someone on the phone, getting angry. While he was distracted, I noticed he'd left the basement door unlocked. This was my chance. I quietly climbed the stairs and saw him through The window still arguing on the phone by his truck. The front door was about 15 feet away. I knew I had to be smart about this. If I ran straight out, he'd see me immediately. Instead, I crawled on my hands and knees toward the back of the cabin. There was a small window near the floor that looks like it might be big enough for me to squeeze through. I managed to push it open and wiggle through, scraping my arms and legs on the frame. Once outside, I ran as fast as I could toward the sound of the train tracks. I figured if I could reach them, I might find help or at least know which direction LED back to civilization. My legs felt like jelly from being tied up for days, but pure adrenaline kept me moving. After running for about 10 minutes, I heard dogs barking in the distance. Then I heard voices calling my name. It was the search and rescue team my mom had called in. I screamed as loud as I could and kept running toward the voices. A police officer.

Last summer I got a text welcoming me to basketball dads 2023. Someone named Greg added me saying practice was Tuesdays at 6 and I needed to bring orange slices next week. I don't have kids, I'm not even that into sports, but I had just moved to a new city where I knew absolutely no one and something about being included felt nice so I just replied. Got it, thanks! Chat was surprisingly active. These dads were serious about their 8 year olds basketball league. They discussed zone defense strategies, complained about referee calls, and debated the merits of different sports drinks. I Learned that Coach Tim was too soft on the kids, that Brandon's dad never volunteered for anything, but always criticized that Kevin's son had real potential if he'd just focus more. When it came time for my orange slices, I panicked. Couldn't show up at a random children's basketball practice, so I texted that my car broke down but I'd Venmo someone for the snacks. Dave immediately replied no worries man, we got you. Car troubles are the worst. I sent $15 to Dave and felt strangely good about it. These guys were nice. Weeks passed, became invested in the team's progress. They lost to the Eagles by two points and I found myself genuinely disappointed. I celebrated when little Marcus finally made a basket after trying all season. Greg texted everyone about an end of Season Celebration at his house. All dads expect to attend. I considered coming clean, but by then I've been in the chat for two months. It would be weird to admit I wasn't actually part of their community, so I ghosted, ignored the invitation and subsequent messages asking if I was coming. The chat gradually slowed as the season ended. I figured that was it until three months later when my phone buzzed. Basketball Dads 2,023 has been renamed Soccer Dads fall 2,023 Greg alright, dad adds new season, new sport. Practice starts next Thursday. Dave my Tyler has never played soccer before. Any tips? Mike just buy good shin guards. Remember when Danny got bruised last year? They were back, and somehow so was I. This time I participated more, offering encouragement after games and soccer advice. I quickly researched on YouTube. The group needed a substitute. I nearly had a heart attack. Luckily, Brandon's dad finally volunteered for something. The team scheduled photo day and Greg sent a message. Need to confirm which kid belongs to 5 1 6 5 5 5 5 8 2 4 1 for the roster. That was my number. I froze. After eight months of being a phantom soccer dad, I had no choice but to confess. Guys, I need to tell you something. I don't actually have a kid on the team. I was added by mistake last year and just never left. Sorry for the weird deception. The chat went silent. For a full day. Greg finally

After watching my dad hit my mom for years, I finally hit him back and ended up in a psych ward. They classified me as violent. So I spent 7 months in a white room with nothing but my thoughts. When I was finally released, all I wanted was a family of my own, one built on love, not fear. That's how I met Noah. He was 6, living in a group home after being removed from his fourth foster placement. The social worker warned me he was challenging, code for traumatized. But when I saw him sitting alone, methodically lining up broken crayons by size, something in my heart cracked open. I sat down beside him and asked what he was drawing. Without looking up, he said a house with no yelling. I noticed burn marks on his arms, perfectly circular cigarette burns. I had similar scars, only mine were from my dad's cigars. The first few weeks were rough. Noah tested every boundary, waiting for me to snap. He'd break things, scream that he hated me, try to run away. But I never raised my voice, never threatened, never hit. Instead, I'd sit with him during his meltdowns, speaking softly until his breathing steadied. One night, I found him in the kitchen at 3 a. M. Stuffing cereal into his pockets. I'm not mad, I said, keeping my distance. But can you tell me why his voice was barely A whisper in case you change your mind about me. Like everyone else, I opened the pantry, showing him the extra shelves I'd installed. This is your food, too. You'll never go hungry here, I promise. Slowly, things improved. He started sleeping through the night, stopped hoarding food, called me dad for the first time after I spent hours helping him build a blanket fort. Then he showed up at our door claiming he changed, found god wanted his son. Noah hid under his bed when he heard that voice, shaking so hard the frame rattled. The custody battle was brutal. His father had family money, hired expensive lawyers. They painted me as unstable because of my psych ward. Stay said a single man couldn't properly raise a traumatized child. But Noah's therapist testified about his progress. His teachers described his transformation from a silent, scared kid to an engaged student who helped younger children. The judge listened. The final hearing was yesterday. Noah squeezed my hand so tight it hurt as his father made one last plea. Then the judge looked at Noah and asked what he wanted. He stood up straight, looked his birth father in the eye and said, I already have a dad, the kind who builds forts and doesn't hurt people. Walking out of that courthouse, adoption papers finally signed no. It turned to me, can we get ice cream? Of course, buddy. Dad. Those other foster homes, they said I was too broken. That No one would want to keep me. I knelt down, meeting his eyes. You were never broken. You were waiting for someone who understood. At night, I heard him crying in his room. When I checked on him, he was organizing his crayons again. But this time, he was drawing our house with both of us inside, smiling. See, he said, pointing, no yelling. Now, whenever Noah has a hard day, we build a fort.

At first, he just wore black clothes. But once he got to high school, he's gone way too far with his strange style and I really don't like it.

Now, I don't have a problem with gay people or anything like that, but I never really wanted that type of thing to be a part of my own household. I've never confronted my son about his sexuality, and I really just don't wanna know. If he does happen to be gay, our relationship is already sort of strained.

I just don't wanna be shoved in my face on top of everything. Ever since my son entered high school, he's made friends with mostly girls. At first I was glad to see this and I was happy that my son still might have a chance of growing up into a real man's man. But as time went on, I realised that he wasn't in a relationship with any of these girls dad. They were all just his close friends.

I tried my best to be non judgmental towards my son, even though to me he looked like more of a freak of nature every day the more he kept leaning into his alternative fashion. I didn't understand it since all of his friends were normal girls, he was the only weirdo in his friend group who dressed like some 90s mall rat. When I look at him, he honestly reminds me of the kind of kids I would pick on in high school anyway about A year ago, I ran out of patience with him when he came home one day with his nails painted a shade of bright blue. My son had never done anything like this before and I couldn't help but feel overwhelmingly disgusted. I, I told him that he had gone too far with his emo bullshit and that I couldn't continue letting him make a fool out of himself like this. I told him that at one point he needed to become a man and painting his nails made him look like some sort of weak top. My son and I had never really been close. We didn't even speak that often. So he looked very hurt as I was telling him all this. But I couldn't help it. He had needed a reality check for so long and there was no avoiding this conversation. I told my son to go get nail polish remover and remove his nail polish right there in front of me. That's when he started to get angry and said that he didn't have to change himself just to appease my dumb, a homophobic son. My son has never spoken to either of his parents this way and I knew that there was no way I was letting him get away with it.

He ran up to his room after this and I followed through on my threat. I took his phone away and replaced it with a flip phone and he wasn't allowed to go out or have his friends over anymore. All he did after that for the rest of the year was call his friends in his room and completely ignore me. One night I overheard him crying to my wife about how much he hated his life since being grounded. But all she said was that I was his father and he needed to respect me. Proud of my wife for sticking up to me behind closed doors. And I still felt like I had made the right decision. I won't lie and say that it hasn't been a difficult year. My son stopped talking to me the day I grounded him and I honestly do miss him. He graduates next year and I just hope before then he'll realise that I was only ever trying to do what was best for him.

I need extra hands. Yeah, I don't think so. I wasn't about to climb into a bathroom stall with a freak. No, please. I think I might bleed out. Her voice was shaking, and suddenly this wasn't funny anymore. It was summer from my English class, a pregnant senior who everyone whispered about, but nobody really talked to. She was sitting on the toilet, gripping the handicap rail with white knuckles, and her face was covered in sweat. What's wrong? I asked, even though I was starting to guess. Please do something. I'm giving birth. She looked up at me with pure terror in her eyes. My whole body went cold. I was 17 and barely knew how tampons worked, let alone babies. But she was crying and alone, and I couldn't just leave her there. I hopped over the stall divider awkwardly and almost slipped on the wet floor. That's when I saw it. The baby was already crowning. There was blood on the toilet seat and the floor, and summer was making the low groaning sounds that scared me more than anything. This was actually happening in a gross school bathroom with fluorescent lights and graffiti on the walls. I'll be right back. I ran out of the bathroom, still in shock. I sprinted down the hallway to missus Bashar's classroom. She was my favourite teacher and The only adult I could think of who wouldn't freak out. I burst through her door, interrupting her lecture on photosynthesis. The whole class stared at me. I need your help urgently, please. I was out of breath and probably looked insane. Missus Bashar took one look at my face and followed me without asking questions. We ran back to the bathroom, and I could hear summer sounds getting louder. Other kids were starting to peek out of classrooms, wondering what was happening. Missus Bashar pushed open the stall door and immediately went into teacher mode. Okay, honey, I'm here. You're doing great. I'm going to support you while she gets the nurse. I didn't need to be told twice. I ran to the nurse's office faster than I'd ever run in PE. When I burst through the door, Nurse Patty was checking Casey's temperature. Casey, who everyone knew was Summer's boyfriend, the guy who'd been bragging about becoming a dad at prom. Summer's having her baby in the bathroom right now. I basically screamed it. Casey's face went from white to green. He threw up all over the floor before Nurse Patty could grab a trash can. But we didn't have time to deal with that. The three of us ran back to the bathroom, with Nurse Patty grabbing emergency supplies from her cabinet. By now, half the school had heard something was happening. Kids were crowding outside the bathroom door, trying to figure out what all the screaming Was about teachers were trying to move them back to class, but nobody was listening. When we got back to the stall, it was chaos. Missus Bashar was holding Summer's hand while she pushed. The nurse immediately took over, checking how dilated she was and telling summer to breathe. Casey stood frozen in the doorway, looking like he might pass out. That's when summer grabbed my hand and pulled me close. You have to get

So, listen, we're smack dab in the middle of one of our most popular games right now, and it's called The Naked Game. Now, I know you're probably freaking out, wondering how this works, so I'm gonna let my co host, Tiffany, explain the rules. Okay, so we have somebody you know very well on hold right now, and he claims that if we asked you the question, who was the last person to see you naked? That you would answer him. Right.

Okay, and you just need a first name or a last name, too? No, no, first name is fine, I guess, but if you can't remember their last names, like, how many people have You seen you naked this week? Okay, buzz, time to shut up over there. Um, okay, Brooke, we need an answer. The last person to see you naked was Austin. Austin? Oh, I'm sorry, that's not the day we were looking for.

Yeah, so if you say like, who is the last person you were naked with? Then it would have been Lucas. Oh, so it wasn't Austin? No. And how do you think Austin feels about that? I, I don't know. Well, why don't you ask him? Cause he's listening right now. Yeah. Hey Brooke, so what happened to he's sleeping on the couch, I promise. I guess the couch turned into your bed then.

My family lived by one rule, you pay what you owe, no matter the cost. So when I was 19 and found out my father had borrowed 200,000 from the Koslov family, I knew our lives were over. My father sat at the kitchen table with his head in his hands while my mother paced and chain smoked. The deadline was three days away and we had nothing. Then Boris Koslov himself showed up at our door with his son, Nikolai. Boris looked at me the way you'd examine a car before buying it. He turned to my father and said, your debt disappears tonight if she marries my son. My father didn't even look at me before agreeing. My mother just lit another cigarette and stared at the wall. The wedding happened in Boris's basement. No dress, no flowers, just papers to sign and men with guns watching. Nikolai was 28 and had dead eyes. After the ceremony, he leaned close and whispered, your currency, nothing more. Remember that? The abuse started that first night. He showed me a room in his house with no windows and a lock on the outside. He said that's where I'd live if I caused problems. He monitored my phone calls and read my texts. If I took too long at the grocery store, he'd show up and drag me out by my arm. He'd remind me what his family did to people who betrayed them. How They made examples of entire bloodlines. He installed cameras in every room except the bathroom. When I showered, he'd bang on the door after exactly 10 minutes. He picked my clothes each morning and inspected me before we left the house. If my makeup wasn't right, he'd wipe it off roughly and reapply it himself. He weighed me every week and controlled my portions at meals. Every week we had dinner at Boris's house. I had to sit silent while they discussed their business like I wasn't there. Drug shipments, territory disputes, names of people who wouldn't be problems anymore. Nikolai would rest his hand on my knee under the table, squeezing harder if I showed any reaction. His mother would smile at me and say things like, such a good girl, knows her place. My parents called once a month to make sure I was being good. They never asked if I was happy or safe, just reminded me that my father's life depended on my cooperation. My younger sister wasn't allowed to talk to me because they didn't want her getting ideas. The breaking point came when Nikolai brought home another woman. He made me serve them dinner while they laughed and touched each other. When I dropped a plate, he backhanded me in front of her. She laughed and said, is this the debt payment? She's not even pretty. That night, while they were in our bedroom, I sat in the kitchen and realized I'd rather die. Trying to escape and live another day as property, I started planning carefully. I saved grocery money and tiny amounts and hid cash and tampon boxes. I memorized bus schedule and studied maps during my allowed library time. I smiled more, acted docile, made Nikolai believe I was finally broken. It took six months to save enough for a bus ticket to another state. I practiced walking with different postures in the bathroom mirror and studied accents on YouTube videos during my supervised internet time. You belong to us, I had said once. There's nowhere we won't find you. The night I ran, I left during his poker game when he'd be distracted for hours. I took nothing but the cash and clothes I could layer. I've been putting sleeping pills in his vodka for weeks, tiny amounts so he'd be groggy but not suspicious. At the bus station, I threw away my phone and bought a ticket with shaking hands. For 48 hours, I didn't sleep certain every stop would bring men with guns, which buses three times and doubled back twice to confuse anyone following. In a truck stop bathroom, I cut my hair with stolen Scissors and dyed it black with a box kit. I traded my coat with a homeless woman and bought men's clothes from a thrift store. By the time I reached my destination, I looked nothing like the girl who'd fled. I ended up in a small mountain town where I got a Job washing dishes under a fake name for two years. I jumped at every car door slam and every Russian accent. I moved constantly, never made friends, worked jobs that paid cash. I Learned to spot surveillance, bury my roots and keep emergency bags packed. One day.

What did you learn? When Nathan took me to his family's mansion for the first time, I knew I didn't belong. The driveway was longer than my entire street and their garage held more cars than my apartment building's parking lot. I was a waitress putting myself through nursing school and he was the heir to a real estate empire. I tried hiding my background. At first. I'd make excuses not to go to fancy restaurants, saying I wasn't hungry or had already eaten. When he bought me designer bags, I'd return them secretly and use the money for textbooks. I even practiced using the right forks at dinner by watching YouTube videos late at night. But Nathan wasn't like his family. He drove a beat up Volkswagen and wore the same three hoodies on rotation. When he found out I was returning his gifts, he started buying me practical things instead, grocery store gift cards, gas money, nursing scrubs. Never made me feel small. His mother, Andrea, was different. She'd ask questions like, what country club did your family belong to? Or which prep school did you attend? When I admitted I went to public school, she'd purse her lips and change the subject. Once she accidentally spilled red wine on my only nice dress at a family dinner. Things got worse when Nathan proposed. Andrea cornered me in the kitchen during our engagement party. How much, she asked, pulling out her checkbook. Name your price to walk away. You clearly only want his money. I was hurt but stood my ground. I love your son. I'm not going anywhere. Two weeks later, she showed up at the diner where I worked, ordering coffee and staying for my entire shift. She left religious pamphlets about marrying within your class with her 10 cent tip. My hands shook so bad I dropped three plates that day. Then came the custody battle. Nathan's cousin Amy had lost her kids to social services after a drug relapse. She was rich, well connected and desperate to adopt, but no agency would approve her with her history. That's when she found Tommy. Tommy was a sweet six year old boy from my old neighborhood. Mom was my regular at the diner, a single mother working three jobs. When she got sick with cancer, she asked me to help find Tommy a good home. I promised I would. Nathan and I applied to adopt Tommy. We had a stable home, good jobs. I'd finish nursing school by then and so much love to give. The social worker loved us. Tommy would come for weekend visits and we'd build blanket forts and make homemade pizzas together. But Andrea and Amy had other plans, hired expensive lawyers claiming we were financially unstable. They dug up my father's old Duis, my mother's welfare records. They painted me as white trash trying to climb the social ladder. Through Nathan, the final blow came When they offered Tommy's dying mother $50,000 to change her recommendation to Amy, she was drowning in medical bills. She took the deal. I was destroyed. But Nathan surprised everyone. He walked into the final court hearing and announced he was given.

One day my daughter came back from school and ran into my arms like she was scared. I could feel her shaking so I took her inside and made some French toast, which was her favorite food. I thought she just had a really bad day and missed being at home. But I couldn't have been more wrong. Once she calmed down, she told me, Mommy, something happened today and I think I'm supposed to tell you about it. An uneasy knot formed itself in my heart when she told me that the school counselor had called her into his office for a special game. He handed my daughter a stuffed unicorn and told her that this new game was very popular with the children, which made my daughter excited and eager to learn. Then the counselor made her point the unicorn between his legs and push on it repeatedly. My daughter told me how he made weird faces at times and then closed his eyes and leaned back. Towards the end, I was so horrified and felt a wave of nausea rush through my body so I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. What kind of sick person would make a 7 year old girl do this kind of thing? Not to mention he worked at a school and it was me who willfully sent my daughter near his vicinity. I kept bouncing between blaming Myself and wanting to burn the entire world. My husband was no longer with us, so it was up to me to stand up for my daughter. I don't know what made me approach the school administration before the police, but that's exactly what I did. And the school administration laughed at me, saying that my daughter was clearly playing a prank. They said they had heard other students make similar jokes about the school counselor and said that parents should teach their kids not to lie. By the time I made it to the police station, the school had already called them and explained the situation. They thought I was a crazy mother who was trying to give merit to my daughter's filthy lie. I had looked straight into my daughter's eyes when she told me the story, so I knew she was telling the truth. But no one wanted to believe me. And I felt like I was in a nightmare. This is when I remembered something important and ran back home to open my jewelry safe. Inside there was a note that I hadn't looked at for a long time. You see, although I was currently a doctor, I had been a very inexperienced nurse at one point. And one time a very stern looking man with a lot of face tattoos walked into our hospital with a bullet wound. No other nurse wanted to treat him since he looks so scary. So they sent me. I Convinced myself that everyone deserves treatment and cleaned his wounds with the utmost concentration. I even engaged him in conversation and joked about how he should stay away from bullets in the future. When it was all over, the guy thanked me and handed me a note with his phone number on it. He said, if you ever need someone taken care of, I won't ask for any payment. I typed in that phone number and to my surprise, it actually connected. I told him who I was and he said, I remember you.

My boyfriend Jake, had been the same couch potato for three years. The guy who needed me to open pickle jars was suddenly doing push UPS at 6:00am. When I asked what sparked this change, he just shrugged and said he wanted to get healthy, but something felt wrong. It's started small. He bought protein powder and left it on the kitchen counter like some kind of trophy. Then he got a gym membership to this fancy place across town instead of the Planet Fitness two blocks away. When I suggested we work out together, he got weird and said he preferred going alone to focus. The red flags kept piling up. He started showering immediately after coming home from the gym, which seemed normal until I realized he never smelled like sweat. His gym clothes were always perfectly clean, too. One day I decided to surprise him with lunch at his gym. The guy at the front desk looked confused when I asked for Jake. Turns out he hadn't been there in weeks. Confronted him that night, he got defensive and said he switched gyms because the other one was too crowded. When I asked which gym, he stuttered and said some random name I'd never heard of. That's when I knew he was lying. So I did what any suspicious girlfriend would do. I followed him the next Tuesday. I Watched him drive past three different gyms and pull into the parking lot of a Starbucks. Through the window, I saw him sitting across from this blonde girl who definitely wasn't just a workout buddy. She was laughing at everything he said and touching his arm constantly. My heart was pounding as I watched them for 20 minutes. When she got up to leave, he grabbed her hand and kissed it. I wanted to storm in there and cause a scene, but instead I waited. He came home an hour later with this fake exhausted look, complaining about how intense his workout was. I played along for two more weeks watching him lie to my face every single day. He even started buying workout supplements and leaving them around the apartment as props. The worst part was when he'd flex his non existent new muscles and ask if I noticed any changes. And I got clever. I told him my friend Emma was looking for a new gym and asked for his recommendation. He panicked and said his gym was full and not taking new members. When I offered to call and check, he quickly said they had a waiting list and it wouldn't be worth it. That weekend, Jake said he was going to a special Saturday morning workout class. Instead, I followed him to the same Starbucks. This time they were holding hands across the table and looking at something on her phone together when he leaned over And kissed her forehead. I knew I had enough evidence, but I didn't confront him yet. I had a better plan. I went home and researched the girl on social media, found her Instagram through the Starbucks location tag. Her name was Ashley. And according to her posts, she'd been seeing someone new for the past month. The timeline matched perfectly with Jake's sudden fitness obsession. Monday night, I casually mentioned.

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning, after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day, I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy, and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was. One Afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said but it still smells like me, so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6 point 10. They make sound effects for everything. Opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7. They'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8. They'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes, and apparently that's normal to them. 9. They'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car. Groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10. They can sit in total silence for an hour staring at the wall, and when you ask what they're thinking about, they say nothing. And somehow they really mean nothing.

Ever since my son Leo was a little kid, he was just awful to other children. At 5 years old, he was kicked out of kindergarten for backing other kids into corners just to watch them cry. When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning, after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother. So one day, I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. Cold feeling wash over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy, and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he was. One Afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice, and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon, when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this! Before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass, just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there, but I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

Mom chose her boyfriend Rufus over me when I was 16. He claimed I stole his Rolex, which was ridiculous since he pawned it weeks earlier for casino money. Rufus gave mom an ultimatum that night. Either she goes or I go. Mom didn't even hesitate. She packed my clothes and trash bags while I was at school and changed the locks. When I got home, my stuff was on the lawn getting soaked by sprinklers. I spent three weeks sleeping in a 24 hour laundromat. The owner eventually caught me, but instead of kicking me out, he offered me a job cleaning his other properties. That's how I met Mister Thief, a 73 year old man who was more powerful than I could have thought. His daughter had died at 17 in a car accident years earlier. When he found me scrubbing his toilet at 2:00am for grocery money, something in his eyes changed. Within a month, he moved me into one of his vacant luxury condos. Not some rundown unit, but a penthouse he usually rented for $5,000 a month. Mr. Thys brought me dinner every night, helped with homework, and taught me the property business. When other kids were learning to parallel park, I was learning to negotiate lease agreements and manage construction crews. He paid for my prom dress, my college tuition, even walked me down the aisle at my wedding. For five years, he was the father I never had. When he died of a heart attack, he left me everything. 47 rental properties worth $18 million. I was 21 and suddenly one of the largest property owners in the city. I tried reaching out to mom once during those years. Invited her to my high school graduation. She never showed. Drove by the house one Christmas Eve and saw her through the window laughing with Rufus. I knocked for 10 minutes. She looked right at me through the glass and closed the curtain. Mom's sister called me when I was 25. Said mom and Rufus were begging family members for money again, asking if I had anything to spare. They've hit up everyone. Cousins, co workers, even Rufus's ex wife. I hung up and never asked about them again. Then yesterday, mom showed up at my office. No call, no warning. Just walked past my secretary with Rufus trailing behind. They look terrible. Mom had aged 20 years and 12, and Rufus's gut hung over his belt like he drunk two cases of beer. They stood in my office doorway, and I knew immediately this wasn't about making amends. They were getting evicted at the end of the month and needed a place to live. Mom demanded I give them one of my properties her sister told her about. Rent free, obviously because children don't abandon their parents. The same woman who threw me out like trash was lecturing me. About abandonment. She even wanted her name on several deeds for tax purposes. When I said I'd think about it, she appeared at my office building every morning with a sign saying, my daughter owns 47 properties, but lets me be homeless. Security dragged them out, but not before she yelled at the top of her lungs that I was mentally unstable and stole Mister Theese's fortune. She even showed up at Mister Theese's grave with flowers, telling mourners he was his real daughter. The woman who abandoned her child was trying to destroy the life I built without her. After 24 hours of harassment, I'd had enough. I called my lawyer and got the paperwork I'd hoped I'd never need. Then I asked my property manager, August, to drive with me to their apartment. I needed a witness for what was about to happen. The three hour drive gave me time to think about everything Mr. Thief had told me. Success is the best.

Call your mom right now. My blood went cold because Mister Chen had never spoken to me in three years of riding his bus. He was gripping the wheel so tight his hands were shaking. I pulled out my phone with trembling fingers, while the other kid kept talking about tomorrow's game, completely oblivious. My mom answered on the first ring, but it wasn't her voice. Hello, sweetie. A man with a thick accent was using her phone. Your mother is busy right now. She wants you to come straight home. No stops. I couldn't speak. In the background, I heard my mom scream, don't come home! Run! The mine went dead. Mister Chen was already on his radio. Code red on Bus 19. I need police at every upcoming stop now! He locked eyes with me in the mirror. Get down on the floor! Don't let them see you through the window. I dropped between the seats, my heart hammering. Other kids started panicking, but Mister Chen's voice cut through. Everyone down! This is not a drill. Through the gap under the seat, I saw we'd blown past my stop. A white van was parked in my usual spot, engine running, sliding door open. Three men in ski masks were standing beside it, and one was holding what looked like zip ties. My phone buzzed with a text from an unknown Number? We have your parent. Get off the bus at the next stop or they die. You have 60 seconds. Photo came through. My parent bound and gagged in what looked like our basement. My dad's face was bloody. Mr. Chen must have seen my face because he grabbed my phone and read it. It's a trap. Trust me, kid. I've seen this before. Seen what before? I sobbed. Your dad isn't who you think he is. He made a hard turn. Tires screaming. Neither am I. Two more white vans appeared, boxing us in. Mister Chen didn't slow down. Instead, he reached under his dashboard and pulled out something I'd only seen in movie. A satellite phone. Phoenix is compromised assets. Family has been taken. Requesting immediate extraction for the package. He glanced at me. Yes, the package is secure. On route to Safe House 7. Package? I was the package. The white vans rammed us from both sides. Kids were screaming. Mister Chen drove like a stunt driver, using the bus's weight to push through. Your dad saved my daughter's life in Afghanistan. He said, never taking his eyes off the road. I promised I'd protect you if his cover was ever blown. Cover? What cover? Your dad's been investigating the Coslov trafficking ring for 5 years. Someone leaked his identity this morning. These aren't kidnappers. They're Russian Mafia. A helicopter appeared overhead. For a second, I thought we were saved. Then Mister Chen swore in a language I didn't recognize the helicopter was theirs. New plan. He handed me a backpack from under his seat. When I stop, you run to the red door of the building on your left. Don't look back. Don't stop. Someone will be waiting. What about my parent? They're not at your house. That photo was staged. Your parents are already in witness Protection. Have been since 6 a m. The agents at the house are decoys. The bus lurched to a stop. Mister Chen hit a button, and the emergency exit flew open. Go now! I ran harder than I'd ever run, the backpack bouncing behind me. I heard gunshot. I didn't look back. The red door opened before I reached it. A woman in tactical gear pulled me inside, and we went straight to a hidden elevator. Your bus driver, I guess. Retired Navy. S

She thought I was going to cry, but I smiled. Then dad came in, shouting at me. Where are the $15,000 we prepared for your sister's college? My name is Valerie, and I'm 22, still living at home while saving money from my job at a tech startup. My sister Bella is 19 and in college, getting everything handed to her while I had to work my way through school. Last month, our parents hit financial trouble when Dad's business took a. They've been secretly selling family heirlooms and mom's jewelry to scrape together Bella's tuition. They got exactly $15,000 in cash. I watched dad count those bills with shaking hands. Grandma's wedding ring, the antique watch, your mother's pearls. Everything we had left, he whispered to mom. Mom was crying quietly. At least Bella won't have to drop out. She doesn't need to know what we sacrificed. Dad asked me to deposit it at the bank since he had client meetings trying to save his business. I placed the envelope in my desk drawer under textbook, planning to go after work. When I got home, Bella was strutting around our living room like she owned the place. She had a brand new designer handbag, expensive clothes with tags attached, and the latest iPhone Pro Max. She was on the phone, twirling around in her new outfit. Yeah, babe, I sent you the $8,000 like I promised. For your car payments. Don't worry about paying it back right away. My heart sank. I ran to my room, yanking open the desk drawer, I searched frantically. The envelope was gone. I stared at the empty drawer, hands shaking. Although those family treasures sold for nothing. Bella, where's the money from my desk? She rolled her eyes like I was being dramatic. Oh, that. I found it just sitting there when I came home early to surprise everyone. I figured it was family money just lying around. I'm family, right? She held up her new phone and took a selfie, then showed me the screen. You should see your face right now. You look absolutely insane. This is hilarious. I watched her posing with her designer bags, completely oblivious to what she'd done. She'd sent $8,000 to some boyfriend I'd never even met, spent thousands more on herself, and was treating it like a joke. Instead of screaming or crying like she clearly expected, I smiled a calm, knowing smile. You're absolutely right. It is family money. That's when we heard Dad's truck pull into the driveway. His engine was making that grinding noise again, the one he couldn't afford to fix. Dad walked in through the front door, his face already red from stress about his failing business. His work clothes were dusty. His hands were rough from taking on manual labor jobs to make ends meet. Valerie, did you deposit the money? The tuition payment is due. Tomorrow morning. And he stopped mid sentence, his eyes landing on Bella's shopping bag. Scatter across the living room floor. His gaze moved from the designer handbag to her new clothes, to the phone in her hand. I could see him trying to process what he was seeing. Dad, I said calmly, Bella found the $15,000 and spent it all today. The color drained

They forgot the exit clause in my founders agreement that stated any adverse change to my compensation triggered a mandatory 25 million dollar penalty. I knew they'd screwed up the moment I saw that cold corporate email. Due to evolving fiscal priorities, your pension benefits are temporarily suspended. No phone call, no explanation. Just a chatbot message for someone who helped build this company from nothing. I sat in my kitchen toast getting cold while reading it again and again. 30 years of weekends, crises, and late nights, and this is how they repay me? Like I was just another line item to cut? The email came from Jennifer Walsh, some 28 year old VP who probably thinks I'm just another old timer collecting dust and accounting. She's never heard the stories about how I mortgage my house three times to keep payroll running in 0 8. Never knew about the Christmas I spent in the server room fixing a catastrophic data breach while everyone else was home opening presents. But here's what they forgot. I'm not just any employee. I'm a founder. I walked to my kitchen cabinet, the one where old papers go to die, and pulled out a dusty black binder. My original founder's agreement from 2001. I flipped to page 47, clause 14 D. Any material adverse change to compensation triggers immediate Severance payout of $25 million, payable within 72 business hours. My old lawyer, Bruce Insisted on it back when we were worth nothing. Four of us in a garage, surviving on ramen and spite. Ellen, he said, pouring cheap whiskey into coffee mugs. Someday this company will get big and stupid. When it does, you'll want to kill switch. We laughed about it then. 25 million felt like monopoly money. Now the company is worth 2.8 billion. I called my current lawyer, Charles. Is clause 14 D still active? 3 hour callback. Ellen, they never avoided it. In fact, when they restructured executive compensation in 2019, your original agreement was typically exempted. They're completely screwed. That's when I smiled for the first time in weeks. I drafted one simple email to HR due to pension freeze. Per HR, 4 5 6 B, invoking clause 14 D. Per founder's agreement. Please confirm wire transfer timeline. E. Morrison, Co founder. I added my old title just to watch them scramble. Sent it at 9:00am on a Tuesday. At 10:15, my phone started buzzing. Unknown numbers, frantic voicemails from people I hadn't heard from in years. Word was spreading through the executive floors like wildfire. The CFO called at 11:00am. His voice was shaking. Ellen, we need to talk. This is. This is serious. About what? I asked, sipping my tea, watching squirrels fight over bird seed in my backyard. The claws. The 25 million claws. Please tell me this is some kind of mistake. Oh, that. No mistake. Yes. 72 business hours. Starts now. Wire instructions are attached to My original no email. Ellen, you have to understand. This could bankrupt the company. The board is an emergency session. Stock price is already dropping on rumors. I let that sink in for a moment. Funny how bankruptcy works, isn't it? One day you're cutting pensions to boost quarterly numbers. The next day you're explaining to shareholders why your cost cutting measure just triggered a 25 million dollar penalty. We can negotiate. The contract doesn't mention negotiations, David. It says 72 business hours. That's Thursday at 5 p m. I hung up and made myself another cup of tea. By Wednesday morning, three different law firms had called the local news.

When I was 14, I had been begging my parents for a service dog for months. My anxiety had gotten so bad that I couldn't even walk into school without hyperventilating in the parking lot. My therapist told them it would help, but they kept saying no. Dad always said dogs were too much work and too expensive. Mom claimed I was just exaggerating my anxiety to skip school. Dad would joke around dinner. If you're too anxious to go to school, how are you gonna walk a dog every day? So when my and Jake called and said his friend couldn't keep their Labrador mix Scout anymore, I said yes without asking. Scout was already trained for emotional support stuff. I met Jake at the park that Tuesday and walked home with this golden brown dog who immediately started following me around like we've known each other forever. My parents lost their minds when I walked through the door. Mom started yelling about responsibility and vet bills. Dad was pacing around the kitchen saying, I couldn't just bring home random animals. We're so mad they could barely speak to me during dinner. But then dad got this idea. He said I could keep Scout for exactly one week to prove I couldn't handle it. He even pulled out this little blue notebook and started writing down everything I did wrong day one. He wrote that I forgot to fill the water Bowl before school. Day two, he noted that Scout tracked MUD on the carpet. But something weird started happening the First Night Scout was there. I didn't have my usual 3:00am panic attack where I'd end up crying under my blanket. Instead, when I started feeling that familiar tightness in my chest around midnight, Scout jumped onto my bed and put his head right on my chest. His weight was warm and heavy, and somehow my breathing just slowed down. The next morning at breakfast, mom asked why I looked so rested. I told her about Scout helping me sleep, but she just rolled her eyes and said it was probably just the excitement of getting what I wanted. Day three was when things got real. I had this math tutoring session with Mr. Peterson that usually left me in tears because I'd get so anxious about making mistakes. This time, I brought Scout with me. Mr. Peterson seemed annoyed at first, but then something crazy happened. Every time I started bouncing my leg or my breathing got fast, scout would gently paw at my arm. It was like he could feel my anxiety building before I even realized it was happening. I actually solved three problems that day without crying. Mister Peterson looked shocked. I told my parents later that he'd never seen me so calm and focused. Day 4 was the real test, though. I had to meet with Missus Collins, the school counselor, because I'd been missing So many classes. Usually these meetings made me wanna throw up. But Scout came with me. He sat right next to my chair. And when Missus Collins started asking about my attendance, felt that familiar panic rising. But Scout immediately put his paw on my leg and looked right at me. Missus Collins noticed everything. She watched how Scout would nudge me when I started fidgeting. How he'd rest his head against my leg when my voice

I was on a five hour flight to visit my aunt in Denver, and I'd specifically paid extra for an aisle seat in the second to last row. I have Crohn's disease, which means sometimes I need to get to the bathroom fast. Like, really fast. This wasn't some random choice I'd Learned the hard way after a few mortifying incidents. Right before boarding, this pregnant woman walks up to me at the gate. She's probably six or seven months along. Not like she's about to give birth or anything. She taps my shoulder and goes, excuse me, I need your seat. I'm pregnant and need to be close to the bathroom. I looked at her boarding pass. She had a middle seat toward the front of the plane. I'm thinking, okay, she didn't plan ahead, but that's not really my problem. I told her politely, I'm sorry, but I have medical issues, too, and specifically booked this seat. He rolled her eyes and said, what kind of medical issues could you possibly have? You look fine. I'm not about to explain my digestive problems to a stranger. So I just said, it's medical, and I paid extra for this seat. That's when she got loud, this is ridiculous. I'm carrying a baby and you're being selfish. Other passengers started looking over. I felt my face getting red, but held my ground. When we boarded, she made sure to Get on right behind me. As I'm putting my bag in the overhead bin, she starts again. FLIGHT attendant this man won't give up his seat to a pregnant woman. Can you make him move? The flight attendant this tired looking woman, probably in her fifties between us. Sir, would you be willing to switch seats with this passenger? I explained the whole situation again, how I'd specifically booked and paid for this seat because of my medical condition. The flight attendant asked if there were any other aisle seats available. There weren't. The flight was completely full. The pregnant woman started getting more aggressive. What medical condition? You're just being difficult. I really need to be near the bathroom. I told her that if bathroom access was medically necessary for her pregnancy, she should have booked an appropriate seat or spoken to her doctor about accommodations. This set her off completely. She started yelling about how I was discriminating against pregnant women and that she was going to report me. Other passengers were definitely watching. Now some guy a few rows up shook his head at me like I was the worst person alive. The flight attendant tried to calm her down, but eventually said there was nothing they could do if I wasn't willing to switch and there were no other seats available. The pregnant woman stomped to her middle seat, muttering loud enough for everyone to hear about selfish jerks and what's wrong with people these days. About two hours into the flight, I had to use the bathroom urgently. As I'm walking back to my seat, the pregnant woman stops me in the eye.

I worked at this clothing store in the mall called thread and Co. The whole place was divided into three sections. Men's, women's, and kids. I always worked the women's section, and during weekdays, I was literally the only person there. Like, completely alone in that entire half of the store. So yesterday, I clocked in with two other employees. My manager, Lisa, pulled me aside right away and goes, your dad's called the store five times asking for your schedule. Tell him to stop. I was so confused because that didn't sound like my dad at all. He's never even called me at work before, let alone five times in one day. I immediately texted him, did you call my work today? He texted back super fast, saying he'd never called my store once in his life. My stomach dropped. I had this awful feeling creeping up my spine. I walked back over to Lisa, who was holding some sweaters, and asked, do you give my dad my schedule? She said yes without even looking up. That's when I told her that wasn't my dad and she had absolutely no right giving some random stranger my work schedule. She finally looked at me and got this annoyed expression. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic and it wasn't a big deal. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Some random Man had been calling my workplace multiple times asking when I'd be there, and she just handed over that information. I started thinking about all the possibilities. This. Some creepy customer who'd been watching me, someone who knew where I lived. My brain was spiraling, thinking about walking to my car alone after closing shifts. The parking garage was already sketchy enough without knowing some weirdo had my exact schedule. Lisa kept folding clothes like nothing happened. She actually shrugged at me. That's when I realised she genuinely didn't understand how dangerous this was. A complete stranger now knew exactly when and where to find me. And she acted like I was overreacting. I looked around the store. It was just me, Lisa, and two other employees for the entire three section store. We were already stretched thin, and I knew if I left, they'd be completely screwed. But I also knew I couldn't stay there knowing my safety had been compromised and my manager didn't even care. I'm done, I said. I quit. Lisa's face completely changed. She dropped the sweater she was holding and started following me as I walked to get my stuff from the breakroom. Wait, you can't be serious. We're already understaffed. Please don't do this to us. But I was already taking off my name tag and grabbing my water bottle. You gave a stranger my personal information and told me I was being dramatic? I'm not staying somewhere where my safety doesn't matter. She started getting frantic, begging me not to leave. I'm sorry, okay? I didn't think about it like that. Please stay. We need you. Her voice was getting shaky. I turned around and looked at her. You need me, but you don't respect me. There's a difference. I started walking toward the exit. That's when she actually started crying. Like, full on tears streaming down her face. She was panicking about having to run the entire store with just two people. She kept apologizing and saying she'd never give out my information again, but it was too late. The thing that really got to me

The doctor said, no heavy lifting for eight weeks. I'm stuck taking care of him when I could be with James. I've been with Rachel for four years and aged for one. She'd always been supportive during my chronic back problems, or so I thought. After my neurosurgeon recommended spinal fusion, Rachel drove me to the hospital, held my hand during prep, and was the last face I saw before anesthesia. I have a weird reaction to anesthesia. I regained consciousness quickly, but remained physically still. I became aware in recovery, maybe 30 minutes after surgery. Eyes closed, breathing slow, but I could hear everything. Then I heard Rachel's voice near my bed. He's still out, she told someone. Before I could signal I was awake, I heard her friend. Ali arrived. How did it go? Ali asked. Fine, I guess, Rachel replied, sounding annoyed rather than concerned. The doctor said, no heavy lifting for eight weeks. I'm stuck taking care of him when I could be with James. James? I didn't know any James. Why not leave? Ali asked quietly. You're not married yet. Rachel paused, then his parents are adding me to their will next month. You know how loaded they are. The old man's health isn't great. Probably why they're updating everything. I just need to stick it out a little longer. My parents, my father, who built a construction company, From nothing. My mother, who taught school for 30 years. The people who'd welcomed Rachel with open arms and insisted on paying for our wedding. That's cold. Raw, even for you, Ali said. It's practical, Rachel replied. Four years listening to him talk about building projects and football, playing nice with his boring family. And now I have to play nurse for two months. What about James? James will wait. Once everything is legal and Richard senior kicks it, I'll be set. James can have his fun now, but he knows the score. Richard senior kicks it. My father. They were discussing my father's death like a business plan. What if Mike wakes up and hears you? Ali asked. Rachel laughed. Cold are please. They pump him so full of drugs, he'll be lucky to remember his name. Besides, he trusts me completely. It's almost too easy. I decided to keep playing unconscious. When a nurse checked my vitals, I woke up slowly, playing the part they expect did. Rachel was immediately by my side. Hey, babe. Everything went great. How are you feeling? Tired, I mumbled. I'm right here. I'll take good care of you. The next few hours, Rachel played devoted fiance perfectly. When visiting hours ended, she kissed my forehead and promised to return in the morning. As soon as she left, I called my parents. Come immediately, it's important. But I'm physically okay. They heard something in my voice and arrived in 30 minutes. I told Them. Everything. James. The will, the death planning. My mother gasped. My father's face turned red. We coordinated immediately. My friend Eric packed all Rachel's belongings into storage. A locksmith changed my apartment locks at 11 p m. My father's attorney removed Rachel from all state documents. My mother called Rachel's parents. They were horrified. I texted Rachel, change of plans. My parents are taking me home tomorrow. Don't come to the hospital. Her reply? Don't be silly, babe. I'll be there at 9:00. I didn't respond. Next

I introduced her to her fiance at my birthday party three years ago. She was crying in the bathroom because another guy had ghosted her, so I literally dragged her out to meet people. And that's when she met her fiance. I stayed up until 4:00am helping her plan the perfect way to ask him out. I held her hair back when she got sick on their first date and drove over with clean clothes. I've already spent 2,000 on the bridesmaid dress, 500 on the bridal shower, and you don't even wanna know how much on the bachelorette party that hasn't even happened yet. Then out of nowhere, she texted me, I can't imagine doing this without you. You're my sister. Here's the part that matters. My mom died eight months ago. She held me at the funeral and whispered, I'll be your family now. She held me while I sobbed until I couldn't breathe and promised we'd get through everything together. Then she text me, we need to talk. Suggest this juice bar downtown. I arrive, and she has actual printed photos spread out on the table. Their inspiration photos of the wedding party, all size 6 or smaller. She's tapping them with her manicured nail and says, you. You have three months to lose 40 pounds, or you can't be a bridesmaid. I stare at her. Bridesmaid. I'm your maid. Of honor. She shakes her head. Not anymore. And if you have a problem with that, you don't have to come at all. That's when I noticed them, her other bridesmaids, sitting two tables over, watching like it was dinner and a show. I stand up slowly and say, I understand perfectly. I'll return the dress tomorrow. She seems shocked by my calm response and start saying, don't be dramatic, I'm trying to help you. But I'm already walking out. First thing the next morning, I block her on everything. Second thing, I turn that two thousand dollar dress and get every penny back. Something about being told I'm too fat to stand next to my best friend makes me realize I've been settling for crumbs my whole life. From her, from everyone. I use the dress refund to sign up for cooking classes I've been wanting to take since college. My friend text me, just come back and lose the weight. You're being a dramatic ass. On the first day of class, I'm chopping onions and crying. The woman next to me is also aggressively chopping and crying. She says, rough day? I say, rough friend. She says, same. Mine just stole my business idea. We go for drinks after class. Three margaritas in, she mentions her uncle is selling his taco truck because he's retiring. We joke about buying it together and becoming the taco Queens of the city. A few days later, she texts, I was serious. About the truck. We meet her uncle, who shows us around. It needs work, but it runs. And he throws in all his recipes. We shake hands on 15,000 split between us. I'd saved most of that to gift my best friend her dream honeymoon to Greece. Now I'm using it to start my own dream. Meanwhile, I see the bride posting, anyone know a reliable bridesmaid asking for a friend? Every Friday night we park outside the college bars and drunk kids love us. We're booked every weekend. We've named it Misfit Tacos, and people can't get enough. My cooking friend is my actual best friend. Now. We have matching taco tattoos. The wedding happens without me. I don't check social media. That

Three months later, she was begging for my boring chicken and rice. We've been together for four years, living together for two. I Learned to cook for my Korean mom. She Learned what to eat based on influencers. Two months ago, Michaela came home from a work dinner at some fancy restaurant looking disgusted. Babe, I can't do this anymore. Watching you eat the same chicken breast and broccoli five days a week is literally depressing me. My workers are all doing Blue Apron, trying new cuisines, actually experiencing food. We're young professionals, not college students surviving on ramen. Fair point, but meal prep saves me time and money. That's exactly the problem. You have zero culinary adventure. You eat for fuel, not pleasure. Let's cook separately so I don't have to. Prison food. She actually used the word dystopian to describe my Tupperware containers. Fine. Let's see how this culinary independence works out. So that Sunday, I did my usual meal prep routine. Five pounds of chicken, two bags of rice, assorted vegetables. Total cost $42 for the entire week. Meanwhile, Michaela spent $387 at Whole Foods buying saffron truffle oil, organic heirloom tomatoes, and ingredients for exactly three recipes she screenshotted from TikTok. She posted an Instagram story of her haul with the caption, finally eating like an adult. Week one, she made one elaborate mushroom risotto that took three hours. And used every pot we owned. Turned out decent actually. Week two, the other ingredients started going bad immediately. Turns out fresh basil doesn't last two weeks. I'm watching her throw away $40 worth of spoiled organic vegetables. Then she attempted pan seared salmon with herb blanc sauce. Smoke alarm went off at eleven PM. Thick gray smoke everywhere. Couldn't see across the kitchen. I ran in with a towel, frantically waving at the alarm while she stood frozen holding a flaming pan. The salmon was charcoal on one side, raw on the other. The sauce had separated into. Our neighbor knocked asking if we needed the fire department. I followed the recipe exactly. She was near tears, mascara running from the smoke. That salmon cost 47 dollars. She ordered Thai food at midnight. I just need a break to regroup after that. Doordash notifications every single day. She's discovered artisanal meal delivery. 28 dollar grain bowls, 32 dollar popcorns, 24 dollar acai bowls. Everything's a bowl and everything's overpriced. Meanwhile, I'm actually perfecting my system without having to accommodate her preferences. Started experiment hunting with marinades. Discovered this incredible garlic ginger sauce. Bought a food scale for perfect portions. Lost eight pounds without trying. My grocery Bill dropped to $35 per week. Month two she's gained 12 pounds from restaurant portions. Spent $2,300 on food. According to her Mint app notification that she immediately swiped away. Making passive aggressive comments about my sad desk lunches while secretly staring at My perfectly seasoned chicken. The funniest part? She started following meal prep accounts on Instagram but won't admit she's interested. Instead she makes comments to her friends on Facetime about how I literally weigh my rice like a serial killer. While she's eating takeout sushi for the third night straight. Month three. Her credit card gets declined at Chipotle. She's maxed it out at $5,000. Mostly food delivery and overpriced groceries that went bad. She comes home to find me eating my standard Monday dinner grilled chicken with homemade teriyaki glaze over Jasmine rice. She just stands there defeated. That smells like restaurant food. How is that your boring meal prep? I show her my spice drawer. 32 different seasonings, 5 homemade sauce recipes, 3 marinades rotating weekly. You thought I was just throwing plain chicken in the oven? I've been perfecting these recipes for two years. Each container is different even though I use the same base ingredients. She opens my fridge, actually looks at my labeled containers for the first time. Monday Teriyaki, Tuesday Buffalo, Wednesday Mediterranean, etcetera. This is more variety than my $30.

My brother was born when doctors said my mom couldn't have more kids. They called him their miracle baby. I was 7 and suddenly invisible. For my 10th birthday, I asked to go to Dave and Buster's. They took my brother shopping for school clothes instead. Your birthday can wait, mom said. It never got rescheduled. By high school, the pattern was set. He'd break something, blame me, and I'd get found it. He failed every class, but got a BMW for his 18th birthday. I was valedictorian and got a card. They skipped my graduation because he felt left out and needed a beach day. I stayed home during college to save money, working two jobs while finishing my degree. Every morning, my brother would jingle his BMW keys at me. Still taking the bus. Loser. After six months of overtime shifts, I finally had enough for a down payment. My friend's dad owned a used car dealership and cut me a deal on a blue Dodge Challenger. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. First thing I'd ever owned that my parents hadn't touched. Parked it in the driveway that night, put the keys on my dresser and took about 50 photos. Even posted one on Instagram with the caption earned, not given. Next morning, the keys were gone. So was the car. So was my brother. He probably just borrowed it, mom said. Not looking up for making His favorite breakfast. You know how boys are. He stole my car. Family doesn't steal from family. Three hours later, I heard the engine. My brother pulled up in my challenger. Except the front bumper was dragging, passenger mirror was gone, and there was a cracked spider webbing across the windshield. He tossed me the keys. Your car is junk, bro. Fell apart on the highway. You should get your money back. I stared at the damage. You crashed it. Prove it. My parents immediately sided with him. Dad actually said I should apologize for accusing him of lying. Mom suggested I let my brother borrow it whenever, since he's used to nicer cars and did you a favor by testing it. I walked inside, pulled up my phone, and called 9 1 1. I'd like to report a stolen vehicle that's just been returned damaged. My mother lunged for my phone. What are you doing? Exactly what you do if a stranger stole and crashed your car. The cops arrived in 20 minutes. My brother was smirking until I pulled up the dash cam footage I'd uploaded to the loud. See, I'd installed cameras the day I bought it. Not because I'm psychic, but because I park it in a neighborhood where cars get broken into. The footage showed everything. Him hot wiring it at 3 a m, drag racing down the interstate, T boning a stop sign, laughing as he surveyed the damage, even calling his friend to Brag about teaching me a lesson. The officers watched 30 seconds before cuffing him. This is grand theft auto and reckless endangerment. One said the damage alone makes it a felony. My parents went nuclear. Mom screaming about family loyalty, dad threatening to kick me out. My brother just staring at me like he couldn't comprehend consequences existed. He's your brother, mom sobbed.

Daniela got rejected by Hudson three weeks ago. He's this quiet kid in our chemistry class who mostly keeps to himself. Daniela has been obsessed with him since September. She finally asked him to Winter Formal, and he politely said no. He wasn't mean about it. He just said he wasn't interested in dating right now. Daniela completely lost it. She's 17 like me, but she acted like a psycho ex girlfriend from a Netflix show. She came to my house that night sobbing and saying Hudson humiliated her. I tried to tell her it wasn't that deep, but she wasn't hearing it. She kept saying he thought he was better than her, that he needed to be taught a lesson. A week later, Daniela showed me something on her phone that disgusted me. She'd created a whole fake Instagram account. Some gorgeous girl named Angela from our neighboring school. She'd been messaging Hudson as this fake girl for five days already. Hudson had completely fallen for it. This kid who barely talks to anyone at school was pouring his heart out to Angela. He told her about his anxiety, how his dad left when he was 12, how he felt invisible at school and wondered if anyone would ever actually want him. He sent her his artwork that nobody knew. He did these beautiful charcoal drawings of birds and landscapes. He even sent her Poems he wrote about being lonely. Daniela was screenshotting everything. She had hundreds of screenshots saved in a folder on her phone labeled Hudson's Funeral. When I saw that folder name, I felt sick. I asked Daniela what she was planning. She got this creepy smile and told me the plan. Hudson's 18th birthday was next Friday. His mom had rented out the bowling alley and invited our whole chemistry class. She was trying to help him make friends, since he struggled socially. Daniela was going to connect her laptop to the TV screens at the bowling alley. She was going to display all of Hudson's messages for everyone to see. Everything. His poems about wanting to disappear, his message about being scared he'd die a virgin. A voice note where he talked about his depression and medication. Photos of his artwork with deeply personal captions about his dead dad. She even had a message where he admitted he cried himself to sleep sometimes. I told Daniela she couldn't do this. This would destroy him. She just laughed and said I was being dramatic. She said maybe next time he wouldn't reject girls who were clearly out of his league. Then she said something that made my blood run cold. She said after everyone saw what a loser he was, maybe he'd finally kill himself and do everyone a favor. That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about Hudson. How he helped me pass chemistry last year. How he Always smiled and said hi, even though we weren't friends. How excited he'd been lately, probably because he thought Angela actually liked him. Two days went by, and I watched Hudson at school. He was different, more confident. He actually raised his hand in class. He sat with people at lunch instead of alone. This fake relationship was the best thing that had happened to him, and Daniela was about to weaponize it. I couldn't let it happen. Four days before the party, I did something that would probably end my friendship with Daniela. I made my own anonymous Instagram account. I messaged Hudson, saying I went to Angela's school and needed to warn him. I told him Angela was fake, that someone from his school was catfishing him, and plan something horrible for his birthday. Hudson didn't believe me at first. He said I was probably just jealous or trying to mess with him. So I did something I still feel guilty about. I sent him screenshots that Daniela had sent me. Screenshots showing the back end of the fake account with Daniela's email attached. Hudson blocked the Angela account immediately. He didn't come to school for three days. The day of his party arrived. Daniela still showed up with her laptop in her bag, hoping Hudson would show. But Hudson never came to his

When my best friend Noah got engaged to Lauren, I was literally the one who helped pick out the ring. We spent three hours at this fancy jewelry store downtown while he stressed about every detail. Everyone kept saying Lauren and Noah were like this perfect power couple. He was super steady and patient. She was bubbly and smart as hell. And me, I was just the loyal third wheel. Basically their honorary sister at that point. But here's the thing. Nobody knew. When Noah had those really rough days at work, he didn't call Lauren. He called me. I knew his exact coffee order. Black with two sugars and oat milk foam. I knew his mom was having surgery for her hip, and he was freaking out about it. I even knew the password to his laptop because he always forgot it and would text me at random times. Lauren didn't even know what his favorite movie was. The Princess Bride. By the way. Six weeks before the wedding, I went over to Lauren's apartment to try on my bridesmaid dress. It was this ugly sage green thing that made me look like a sick plant, but whatever. While she was in the kitchen making tea, I was looking for a hairbrush in her bedroom because my hair was a complete mess from the rain. I opened what I thought was her bathroom closet, but It wasn't. Inside was her wedding dress, which was gorgeous and white and perfect. But right next to it was this red cocktail dress I'd never seen before. Expensive looking heels, and a whole stack of love notes tied with a ribbon. The handwriting definitely wasn't Noah's. My stomach dropped. I quickly closed the closet and pretended nothing happened. But my hands were literally shaking when Lauren came back with the tea. I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. Finally, I worked up the nerve to confront her. We met at this coffee shop near her work, and I just straight up asked her about the notes. She went completely pale and started crying right there in front of everyone. She told me the affair had ended months ago, but she still wasn't sure she actually loved Noah. She said she felt super pressured to marry him because he was quote unquote, the perfect guy, and literally everyone thought they were amazing together. Her parents loved him, her friends were jealous. Even her boss would ask about wedding planning. I was completely devastated, but I kept my mouth shut for Noah's sake until the night before the wedding. Noah showed up at my apartment around 11 at night with this bottle of cheap wine and said he had cold feet. I figured he was just nervous like most people get before their wedding. But then he said something that completely shook me. He goes, I feel like I'm marrying A total stranger. The only person who actually makes me feel like myself is you. I didn't sleep at all that night. I sat in my car outside the wedding venue at, like, five in the morning, completely torn between ruining my best friend's big day and saving him from what I knew was basically a lie. My phone kept buzzing with texts from other bridesmaids asking where I was for hair and makeup. But in the end, I didn't have to decide anything. Lauren never showed up. Noah stood at the altar for 20 minutes in his gray suit, looking confused while everyone whispered. Her maid of honor kept trying to call her. Finally, someone found a note in the bridal suite that just said she couldn't do it and she was sorry. The next day, Noah

My brother texted, stay out of our lives. I replied, fine. Then I kept the house I'd secretly bought them as their wedding gift. I'm the family provider, the one who got lucky with a successful company. My brother Wyatt is 28. Creative type, make beautiful furniture nobody buys. His fiance Alana teaches yoga and talks about energy like it's currency. I never trusted Alana. She'd say things that sounded sweet but felt sour. It must be nice never worrying about money like regular people. She'd smile while her eyes calculated what I was worth. Seven months ago, I bought a house in their dream neighborhood without telling them. Three bedrooms, original hardwood, a workshop space perfect for Wyatt. I paid cash and planned to transfer the deed at their wedding as the ultimate gift. The paperwork was all set. My lawyer had the transfer documents ready. All I needed was to wait for their September wedding and surprise them with keys and a bow. Wyatt had no idea about the house. I'd been careful to keep it secret. I even staged furniture shopping trips with him to see what he liked. At my company's summer party, I introduced Wyatt to potential clients. A woman who ran an interior design firm loved his work. Another owned a boutique hotel chain looking for custom pieces. I was networking for him like I always did. Alana watched from the bar with laser focus. She saw a conspiracy in every handshake and betrayal in every business card. Three days later, my phone exploded with messages from Wyatt. Alana had told him everything she'd witnessed. She claimed I'd been pushing women at him for months. She said I told them he was unhappy and looking to upgrade. The lies were specific and designed to wound. Said I called her a gold digger. To the hotel owner. She claimed I said Wyatt deserved someone with ambition. I tried calling Wyatt to explain. He sent me straight to voicemail. Then came his final message. That afternoon, Alana showed me what you've been doing. Stay out of our lives. After nearly three decades as brothers, I was deleted. I sat in my living room feeling oddly calm. I texted back. Fine. My next call was to my property lawyer. Kill the transfer papers for the house. But the wedding is next month. Plans changed. The house stays in my name. This is a significant financial decision. Are you certain? Completely certain. Four days later, Wyatt was pounding on my apartment door at 11 at night. We need to talk about the wedding. We're not talking. You made that clear. This is different. Where's the registry info? Alana's family keeps asking what registry? The one you set up for house stuff. Mom mentioned you were organizing something big. The irony was perfect. Quiet. I bought you a house. His face drained Of color. What do you mean, bought? Past tense. I was giving you and Alana a house for your wedding. Where is it? Still mine. You told me to stay out of your lives. That includes my gifts. Alana appeared behind him in the hallway. You can't take back what you already promised. I never promised you anything. The house was a surprise that never happened. This is

My cousin called me last week to tell me that my boyfriend Matt wasn't invited to her wedding anymore because apparently he didn't match the aesthetic of her perfect Vineyard wedding. She actually said the words I need everyone in my photos to have a certain caliber and explained that Matt, with his contractor trucks and work boots wasn't giving the elevated vibe she needed. Then she hit me with a real kicker by saying I was only invited to the ceremony since technically I was extended family and she wanted to keep the reception for people who run in the same circles, not relatives. Her mom made her invite. I sat there listening to her explain how the reception was for her sorority sisters and investment banker friends while I tried not to laugh out loud. Eight months ago, she'd been sobbing to me about how every venue wanted $40,000 and her parents had given her a 20 thousand dollar budget already blown on her dress. I mentioned that Matt's parents owned a Vineyard venue and maybe I could ask about availability. She literally begged me to check. And when I told her they could do it, she screamed that I was the best cousin in the world and she'd never forget this. What she never bothered to figure out was that the only reason she got that venue basically free was because Matt's parents Adore me like I'm already their daughter. I spend every Sunday at their house for dinner helping his mom Linda with her garden. They were doing this as a massive favor, calling me their future daughter in law even though Matt and I aren't engaged yet. And gave my cousin the friends and family rate, which meant she only paid for staff and catering, not the actual 35,000 dollar venue fee. My cousin never asked how I got such an insane and deal and just assumed I knew somebody who knew somebody, while she posted constantly about her dream venue and how she manifested it through positive thinking. After she finished her speech about curating her guest list for the right energy, I told her I completely understood her vision and hung up. Then I called Linda, who answered on the first ring like always. I explained what my cousin had said about Matt not being the right caliber and how I was being hidden away during the ceremony like some embarrassing relative. Linda got so quiet I thought the call dropped, and then she said in that voice mothers use when they're about to destroy someone, that spoiled little princess is about to learn what happens when you bite the hand that feeds you. Linda asked if my cousin had signed an actual contract, and I told her no because we'd handled everything through texts. Since it was a family favor, she said she needed to make a quick Home call and would call me right back, but I could hear her muttering about ungrateful brats insulting her baby boy. Twenty minutes later Linda called back and said in her most fake upset voice that there had been a terrible mistake with a booking system and unfortunately they double booked that date with a Fortune 500 company retreat paying full price and since there was no formal contract, they'd have to go with a confirmed paying client. She said my cousin would be getting an apologetic call from their event coordinator within the hour, explaining that if she still wanted the venue, she'd need to pay the full rate of 35 thousand dollars plus a five thousand dollar rush fee or they'd have to release the date immediately. I tried to tell Linda she didn't have to go nuclear, but she cut me off and said honey, when someone tells me my son isn't good enough for their fancy pictures while using my property for free, they better pray I only take away the venue. She added that the coordinator would hopefully provide other venue options, which she knew were all either booked or charging 50,000 because she'd already called her friends who owned them.

My friends were wasted and making increasingly stupid bets until my friend Ruby made one that beat them all. I want someone here to propose to a stranger, she said, dropping a ring pop on the table. The other girls giggled about how they'd never do it. I didn't really care until she dropped an offer so enticing I couldn't ignore it. I'll pay someone's entire semester tuition if they do it right now. Everyone went quiet. That was serious money. Not just propose, she added, grinning. You have to really sell it on your knee. The tears, the heartwarming speech, the whole thing. But I get to choose the guy. And you absolutely cannot tell him it's a bet. What if he says no? I asked curiously. Ruby shrugged. Doesn't matter. Just entertain us. I thought about it. I needed that money desperately. My parents were already working two jobs each. I took a deep breath and grabbed the ring pop. I'll do it. Ruby scanned the room. She grinned when her eyes landed on a guy in red flannel. My face immediately turned red. It was an old classmate I chased after an elementary school who pushed me when I tried to give him a Valentine's Day card one year. No way, I said, shaking my head. Choose someone else. Literally anyone else, I begged. Rubby shrugged. Like I said, entertain us. And that tuition is Yours, but I have a history with him. Then she said, it'll be very easy for him to say no again, and you win. She had a point. It was an easy win. My friends got their phones out, giggling and stumbling, ready to have the best story to tell around campus tomorrow. I downed a quick shot of tequila and made my way over. Before I could lose my nerve, I dropped down on one knee, pulled out the ring pop, and held it in front of me. Rico, I've liked you since elementary school. Let's skip the dating. I felt my stomach cartwheeling as the room fell silent watching us. I took another deep breath. Will you marry me? I shouted, glancing up at him. Rico's face went from confused to complete shock. Then he grinned. I thought you'd never ask. He pulled me up, dipped me like we were in some old movie, and kissed me. The entire bar exploded. People were cheering and buying us drink. During the chaos, he whispered, I don't know what this is, but I'm committed. My eyes widened. I stood there frozen, watching my friends stare back at me, looking equally shocked. This was not how it was supposed to go. I tried to run, but he caught my hand. Hey, where's my fiance going? I felt my head spinning. Just need some air. I managed. I tried avoiding Rico the next morning, but he still found me at the campus Coffee shop. So the girl who chased me with Valentine's cards finally got me, he said, sliding into the seat across from me. Took you long enough. I instantly sat up, surprised to see him again. Oh, god, it was real! He laughed. Very. It was a beautiful speech. I mean, let's get dating. Your pushy attitude hasn't changed, hey? I protested. He grinned. I'm glad you're still the same. I felt my heart skip a beat. Just before I could tell him about the bet, he pulled out his wallet and showed me a crumpled piece of paper. The Valentine's card I'd made him, with crooked hearts and misspelled words. I went back for it after I pushed you. Been carrying it around since we ended up at the same college. Guess I was waiting for you to ask again. I couldn't tell him, not with that card in his hand. Not when he seemed so sincere. So we started dating for real.

How did it end? I've been a school nurse for 12 years, and kids always tell me the wildest things. Most of the time, they tell me dramatic tales about invisible ninja attacks or cry about how their scraped knee surgery immediately. But one day, a little girl told me something that messed me up. Elena came limping in from recess with blood literally boring down her shin from where she'd fallen off the monkey bars. She was this tiny little thing with huge brown eyes. She jumped up on my table like nothing happened, even though her knee looked like someone had taken a cheese grater to it. I quickly grabbed my supplies and started cleaning it with the antiseptic that burns like absolute hell when it touches cuts. Elena just sat there humming some TikTok song while I worked on getting chunks of gravel out of her knee. You're being so brave, sweetie, I told her. She smiled at me with this proud little grin and said, Cole taught me that being quiet when something hurts means you're winning. Winners get the best prizes, like McDonald's or staying up past bedtime. I kept working, but something about how she said it made every alarm bell in my head start screaming. That's interesting, honey. Who's Cole? I asked while reaching for the antibiotic ointment. He's my mommy's boyfriend. He watches me every day after school. Elena held Perfectly still while I spread the ointment on her knee. Cole says I'm getting really good at the cigarette game. Last week I lasted 43 seconds, which is longer than he thought a little kid do it. My hand froze halfway through opening a bandage, and I felt like I was going to puke. What's the cigarette game? I asked, trying to keep my voice normal. Elena rolled up her sleeve, and I literally had to grab the desk to keep from falling over. Her entire little arm, from wrist to shoulder, had at least 30 perfect circle burns in neat rows like some psychos art project. It's when Cole puts his cigarette on my arm and checks how long I can stay quiet. If I make noise before the timer goes off, I have to sleep in the garage with no blanket. But if I win, I get to pick what we watch on TV. Last time I got to watch two episodes of my show because I'm getting so good at it. As soon as Elena left my office with her knee wrapped up and a lollipop in her hand, I locked my door and called Child Protective Services. My voice was shaking so bad the operator could barely understand me as I told them what Elena had said. They had someone at our school in 30 minutes to talk to Elena. Elena told them everything like she was talking about her favorite TV show or something. Cole Had been burning her since she was 5 years old to toughen her up because he said the world wasn't nice to weak people. He made her stand naked in the garage while he burned her with cigarettes, lighters, and hot metal spoons. The worst part was he'd started bringing his friends over to watch the games and bet on how long she could last before she screamed. The cops arrested Cole at his job and found the most disturbing stuff I've ever heard about on his computer. There were over 500 videos of Elena being tortured, with titles like Teaching Her Place and Breaking Baby Girl, with dates going back two years. He had plans to start using a blowtorch because

My husband threw his beer bottle in the sink, pointing at the moldy dishes. Our son left for a week. He's 19 and you still wake him up for work? Then the real problem dropped when he showed me a text from his girlfriend's mom. She asked if he has special needs because he brought laundry to their house and didn't know which button started the washer. My face burned while I listened to him. You make his appointments, pack his lunch, pay everything while my boss's son just bought a condo. At that moment, our son was passed out on the couch at 2 p m, Xbox controller on his chest, wearing 3 day old pajamas. Cut him off or I'm filing for divorce. Seriously, this has gone too far. That threat made something snap inside me. Fine. Tomorrow he's on his own, I said. Next morning, our son found nothing but a sticky note where breakfast usually waited. Adults buy their own food. His phone died during his job interview call because I killed service at 5:00am. His interview suit sat soaking in the washer for two hours until he needed to leave when he pounded on my door screaming about losing the job opportunity that paid $25 an hour, turned up my podcast and grit my teeth. Three days later, smoke detector screamed at 1:00am because he'd set spaghetti On fire, destroying my grandmother's cast iron pot she carried from Italy. I watched him wave a pizza box at the ceiling while pasta flames licked the cabinet. Pasta can't actually catch fire was the crazy thing. My husband laughed. He's learning. Day 5, our son lost his warehouse job without car insurance. To drive there, he had to walk four miles in boots that shredded, his feet bloody when I passed him limping through rain, knowing he'd miss. And without that job, I kept driving. Week two, he sold his Xbox for $150 to avoid eviction. He was down 10 pounds from eating stolen ramen, working three jobs, including overnight toilet cleaning. I even found him unconscious standing against a bus stop one day. That same evening, my husband left for poker, saying, this builds character, while our son texted, whatever I did wrong, I'm sorry. I couldn't see the road through tears. Then the 2:00am hospital call stopped my heart. Your son collapsed at work from severe exhaustion. When I got to the hospital, he told me even worse news. He had moved in with a boy we knew, a dealer we'd protected him from for years. The nurses found track marks between his toes, not from drugs, but stolen diabetic lancets. Because high sodium from all the ramen he ate made him think he was going crazy. The doctor said another week of just Oman would have meant organ failure. My husband showed up drunk from the Late night poker, but still annoyed about leaving early. That's when everything exploded. Where were you? Our son's voice cracked from the hospital bed. For interviews. First days, any day. The truth or doubt. My son listed every abandoned baseball game, every stuck in traffic lie, every birthday his father forgot existed. I'd covered those wounds with Band Aids until I realized the bleeding would never stop. The truth sat between us like a court. I hadn't been babying anyone. I've been desperately trying to give my son one functioning parent since his father checked out years ago. My husband stood there in the hospital room, swaying from poker night whiskey.

They forgot the exit clause in my founders agreement that stated any adverse change to my compensation triggered a mandatory 25 million dollar penalty. I knew they'd screwed up the moment I saw that cold corporate email. Due to evolving fiscal priorities, your pension benefits are temporarily suspended. No phone call, no explanation. Just a chatbot message for someone who helped build this company from nothing. I sat in my kitchen, toast getting cold, reading it again and again. 30 years of weekends, crises, and late nights, and this is how they repay me? Like I was just another line item to cut? The email came from Jennifer Walsh, some 28 year old VP who probably thinks I'm just another old timer collecting dust and accounting. She's never heard the stories about how I mortgage my house three times to keep payroll running in O A. Never knew about the Christmas I spent in the server room fixing a catastrophic data breach while everyone else was home opening presents. But here's what they forgot. I'm not just any employee. I'm a founder. I walked to my kitchen cabinet, the one where old papers go to die, and pulled out a dusty black binder. My original founder's agreement from 2001. I flipped to page 47, clause 14 D. Any material adverse change to compensation triggers immediate Severance payout of $25 million, payable within 72 business hours. My old lawyer, Bruce insisted On it. Back when we were worth nothing. Four of us in a garage, surviving on ramen and spite. Ellen, he said, pouring cheap whiskey into coffee mugs. Someday this company will get big and stupid. When it does, you'll want a kill switch. We laughed about it then. 25 million felt like monopoly money. Now the company is worth 2.8 billion. I called my current lawyer, Charles. Is clause 14 D still active? Three hour callback. Ellen, they never avoided it. In fact, when they restructured executive compensation in 2019, your original agreement was specifically exempted. They're completely screwed. That's when I smiled for the first time in weeks. I drafted one simple email to HR due to pension freeze. Per HR, 4 5 to 6 B, invoking clause 14 D. Per founders agreement, please confirm wire transfer timeline. E. Morrison, Co founder. I added my old title just to watch them scramble. Sent it at 9:00am on a Tuesday. At 10:15, my phone started buzzing. Unknown numbers, frantic voicemails from people I hadn't heard from in years. Word was spreading through the executive floors like wildfire. The CFO called at 11:00am. His voice was shaking. Ellen, we need to talk. This is. This is serious. About what? I asked. Drinking my tea. Watching squirrels fight over bird seed in my backyard. The. The claws. The 25 million claws. Please tell me this is some kind of mistake. Oh, that. No mistake. Yes. 72 business hours. Starts now. Wire instructions are attached. To my

My brother was born when doctors said my mom couldn't have more kids. They called him their miracle baby. I was 7 and suddenly invisible. For my 10th birthday, I asked to go to Dave and Buster's. They took my brother shopping for school clothes instead. Your birthday can wait, mom said. It never got rescheduled. By high school, the pattern was set. He'd break something, blame me, and I'd get found it. He failed every class, but got a BMW for his 18th birthday. I was valedictorian and got a card. They skipped my graduation because he felt left out and needed a beach day. I stayed home during college to save money, working two jobs while finishing my degree. Every morning, my brother would jingle his BMW keys at me. Still taking the bus. Loser. After six months of overtime shifts, I finally had enough for a down payment. My friend's dad owned a used car dealership and cut me a deal on a blue Dodge Challenger. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. First thing I'd ever owned that my parents hadn't touched. Parked it in the driveway that night, put the keys on my dresser and took about 50 photos. Even posted one on Instagram with the caption earned, not given. Next morning, the keys were gone. So was the car. So was my brother. He probably just borrowed it, mom said, not looking up from making His favorite breakfast. You know how boys are. He stole my car. Family doesn't steal from family. Three hours later, I heard the engine. My brother pulled up in my challenger. Except the front bumper was dragging, the passenger mirror was gone, and there was a cracked spider webbing across the windshield. He tossed me the keys. Your car is junk, bro. Fell apart on the highway. You should get your money back. I stared at the damage. You crashed it. Prove it. My parents immediately sided with him. Dad actually said I should apologize for accusing him of lying. Mom suggested I let my brother borrow it whenever, since he's used to nicer cars and did you a favor by testing it. I walked inside, pulled up my phone, and called 9 1 1. I'd like to report a stolen vehicle that's just been returned damaged. My mother lunged for my phone. What are you doing? Exactly what you do if a stranger stole and crashed your car. Cops arrived in 20 minutes. My brother was smirking until I pulled up the dash cam footage I'd uploaded to the cloud. See, I'd installed cameras the day I bought it, not because I'm psychic, but because I park it in a neighborhood where cars get broken into. The footage showed everything. Him hot wiring it at 3:00am, drag racing down the interstate, T boning a stop sign, laughing as he surveyed the damage, even calling his friend to brag about Teaching me a lesson. The officers watched 30 seconds before cuffing him. This is grand theft auto and reckless endangerment. One said. The damage alone makes it a felony. My parents went nuclear. Mom screaming about family loyalty, dad threatening to kick me out. My brother just staring at me like he could and comprehend consequences existed. He's your brother, mom sobbed. Then he should have acted like it. The best part came during the trial. My brother's lawyer tried arguing it was a family dispute. Then the prosecutor played the dash cam audio, where my brother said, I hope this teaches him. He'll never have.

She thought I was going to cry, but I smiled. Then dad came in, shouting at me. Where are the $15,000 we prepared for your sister's college? My name is Valerie, and I'm 22, still living at home while saving money from my job at a tech startup. My sister Bella is 19 and in college, getting everything handed to her while I had to work my way through school. Last month, our parents hit financial trouble when Dad's business took a. They've been secretly selling family heirlooms and mom's jewelry to scrape together Bella's tuition. They got exactly $15,000 in cash. I watched dad count those bills with shaking hands. Grandma's wedding ring, the antique watch, your mother's pearls. Everything we had left, he whispered to mom. Mom was crying quietly. At least Bella won't have to drop out. She doesn't need to know what we sacrificed. Dad asked me to deposit it at the bank since he had client meetings trying to save his business. I placed the envelope in my desk drawer under textbooks, planning to go after work. When I got home, Bella was strutting around our living room like she owned the place. She had a brand new designer handbag, expensive clothes with tags attached, and the latest iPhone Pro Max. She was on the phone, twirling around in her new outfit. Yeah, babe, I sent you the $8,000 like I promised. For your car payments. Don't worry about paying it back right away. My heart sank. I ran to my room, yanking open the desk drawer. I searched frantically. The envelope was gone. I stared at the empty drawer, hands shaking. All those family measures sold for nothing. Bella, where's the money from my desk? She rolled her eyes like I was being dramatic. Oh, that. I found it just sitting there when I came home early to surprise everyone. I figured it was family money just lying around. I'm family, right? She held up her new phone and took a selfie, then showed me the screen. You should see your face right now. You look absolutely insane. This is hilarious. I watched her posing with her designer bags, completely oblivious to what she'd done. She'd sent $8,000 to some boyfriend I'd never even met, spent thousands more on herself, and was treating it like a joke. Instead of screaming or crying like she clearly expected, I smiled a calm, knowing smile. You're absolutely right. It is family money. That's when we heard Dad's truck pull into the driveway. His engine was making that grinding noise again, the one he couldn't afford to fix. Dad walked in through the front door, his face already red from stress about his failing business. His work clothes were dusty. His hands were rough from taking on manual labor jobs to make ends meet. Valerie, did you deposit the money? The tuition payment is due. Tomorrow morning. And he stopped mid sentence, his eyes landing on Bella's shopping bag scattered across the living room floor. His gaze moved from the designer handbag to her new clothes.

So I said, good to know and walked out. Packed a bag, threw my keys on the table, texted her, call him then. You're his problem now. The panicked I was joking messages flooded in immediately. Here's the thing. We split rent fifty fifty. But I've been paying 70% because I make more. Plus all utilities and groceries. I texted back, I'll pay exactly 50% from now on. Figure out the rest. I can't afford that. You know I can't. Too bad. Should have thought about that before the comparison. But here's where it gets interesting. Saturday, I went to get my stuff, and she's in full makeup, trying to seduce me back. Can we just talk first? No. Just here for my Xbox while packing. She drops the bomb. Fine. Leave. Devin already reached out anyway. Cool. Hope he knows what he's doing. I genuinely didn't care. But she had already told him we were on a break. His actual girlfriend, Alyssa found out, sent me screenshots of Jenna trying to hook up with him. I forwarded everything to Alyssa. She confronted Devin with receipts. He blocked Jenna completely. Now she's sending emails. You ruined everything! I'm going homeless because of you! My response? Tell everyone the truth. That you compared me to your ex in bed. And I left. See how that goes? Radio silence for exactly three days. Then the real desperation kicked In she started calling my job. Pretend to be worried about me. Hi, this is his girlfriend Jenna. He hasn't been home in weeks. Is he okay? Is he eating? My manager pulled me aside asking if everything was alright. We broke up, I said. He just nodded, but Jenna wasn't done. She called my mom next, spinning some story about how I abandoned her during a rough patch. My mom listened patiently, then asked, honey, what exactly did you say to make him leave? Jenna actually told her. My own mother laughed and said, well, did you call your ex yet? Then came the social media campaign. Vague posts about toxic men who can't handle honest communication and people who abandon you when you need them most. Friends were eating it up in the comments with fire emojis and you deserve better, queen messages. But here's what she didn't expect. Our mutual friends started asking questions. What actually happened? What did she say? She couldn't answer without admitting the truth, so she just kept deflecting with more victim posts. Meanwhile, I'm living my best life. Got a studio apartment downtown, no drama, gaming setup looks incredible. Posted a picture of my new place with the caption peaceful vibes only. Jenna commented within minutes. Must be nice to run away from your problems. I replied, must be nice to have your ex handle them for you. She deleted the comment immediately, but screenshots live forever. Our friends saw everything. Week Three things escalated. Her best friend Jessica reached out. Jenna's really struggling. Can't you just help with rent this month? I sent Jess

When I was 14, I had been begging my parents for a service dog for months. My anxiety had gotten so bad that I couldn't even walk into school without hyperventilating in the parking lot. My therapist told them it would help, but they kept saying no. Dad always said dogs were too much work and too expensive. Mom claimed I was just exaggerating my anxiety to skip school. Dad would joke around dinner. If you're too anxious to go to school, how are you gonna walk a dog every day? So when my Jake called and said his friend couldn't keep their Labrador mix, Scout anymore, I said yes without asking. Scout was already trained for emotional support stuff. I met Jake at the park that Tuesday and walked home with this golden brown dog, who immediately started following me around like we'd known each other forever. My parents lost their minds when I walked through the door. Mom started yelling about responsibility and vet bills. Dad was pacing around the kitchen saying I couldn't just bring home random animals. They were so mad, they could barely speak to me during dinner. But then dad got this idea. He said I could keep Scout for exactly one week to prove I couldn't handle it. He even pulled out this little blue notebook and started writing down everything I did wrong day one. He wrote that I forgot to fill the water. Bowl before school. Day two, he noted that Scout tracked MUD on the carpet. But something weird started happening the first night Scout was there. I didn't have my usual 3:00am panic attack where I'd end up crying under my blanket. Instead, when I started feeling that familiar tightness in my chest around midnight, Scout jumped onto my bed and put his head right on my chest. His weight was warm and heavy, and somehow my breathing just slowed down. The next morning at breakfast, mom asked why I looked so rested. I told her about Scout helping me sleep, but she just rolled her eyes and said it was probably just the excitement of getting what I wanted. Day three was when things got real. I had this math tutoring session with Mr. Peterson that usually left me in tears because I'd get so anxious about making mistakes. This time, I brought Scout with me. Mr. Peterson seemed annoyed at first, but then something crazy happened. Every time I started bouncing my leg or my breathing got fast, scout would gently pat my arm. It was like he could feel my anxiety building before I even realized it was happening. I actually solved three problems that day without crying. Mr. Peterson looked shocked. I told my parents later that he'd never seen me so calm and focused. Day 4 was the real test, though. I had to meet with Missus Collins, the school counsellor, because I'd been missing. So Many classes. Usually these meetings made me wanna throw up. But Scout came with me. He sat right next to my chair. And when Missus Collins started asking about my attendance, I felt that familiar panic rising. But Scout immediately put his paw on my leg and looked right at me. Missus Collins noticed everything. She watched how Scout would nudge me when I started fidgeting. How he'd rest his head against my leg when my voice got shaky. After 20 minutes, she asked to speak with my parents. That evening, she called them and said something that changed everything. My daughter is a completely different person with this dog. This isn't some teenage phase or a crutch she's using to avoid responsibility. This animal is giving her a bridge to function normally. Dad still tried to stick to his one week rule. He kept writing in his stupid notebook. But I noticed the complaints were getting smaller. Left Scouts toy in hallway or dog hair on couch. Nothing about me being irresponsible anymore. Then on day 6, something happened that nobody expected.

I was 17 when I realized my mom was literally trying to kill me. And it all started with a box cutter under my pillow. Growing up, my parents always said I was difficult. Mom would tell neighbors how I cried all the time as a baby. They could never have people over because of the noise. As a teenager, I thought they were just strict. No video games, no sleepovers. Couldn't be alone with my little sister Maya. They said I was dangerous when upset. One Tuesday morning, I stayed home sick from school. Stomach bug or something. I was in the kitchen grabbing cereal when I heard mom on the phone in the living room. She was talking about a life insurance policy. Not weird by itself, but then she said something that made my blood freeze. I don't care what the therapist says. We had to test him, and he failed again. Test me? What kind of test? I crept closer to listen, but she hung up when she saw me. She just smiled and asked if I felt better. Like nothing happened. That night, I pretended to sleep, but kept one eye open. Around midnight, I heard my bedroom window click, then soft footsteps. Mom had unlocked my window from outside and was tiptoeing toward my bed. She slipped something under my pillow, then crept back out. The next morning, she acted totally normal. Made Pancakes, asked about homework, the usual mom stuff. But when I reached under my pillow, my fingers found cold metal. A box cutter with the blade already extended. I stared at it for, like, 10 minutes. She wanted me to find it, to touch it. Maybe cut myself accidentally or on purpose. Something told me this wasn't the first time. I just never noticed before. Instead of touching it more, I wrapped it in a shirt and took it to school. Handed it straight to Mister Garcia, our guidance counselor. He asked where I got it, and I told him everything. Within two hours, CPS was called. The investigation was insane. Turns out my childhood trauma diagnosis was real. But my parents had been faking compliance with treatment for years. They take me to therapy, not along with the recommendations, then do the opposite at home. But the box cutter thing was worse than I thought. Mom had been documenting it in this private Facebook group for parents with troubled kids. Screenshots showed her posting about putting dangerous objects near me to see what I do. Other parents encouraged her to speed things up so I wouldn't ruin their lives. The most messed up part? She'd been taking out life insurance policies using my Social Security number under fake names. One policy specifically paid out for accidental fall or self harm. Like she was literally betting on me dying. My dad knew everything. He helped planet. They both got arrested. That same week, I went to live with my Aunt Rebecca in another state. She showed me the police report later. My parents had been doing this stuff since I was 12. Little tests.

We're halfway through freshman year and my friends still grabbed my wrist to show people how their fingers overlap or joke that I could share my metabolism with them. Not kidding. Last week my roommate Leah literally put extra fries on my plate when I wasn't looking. Because someone needs to feed you, babe. Finding this friend group three months into college felt like finally breathing. They adopted me instantly. Leah pulling me into their booth at the dining hall, Sophie looping her arm through mine at parties. At every party they joke I was their pocket size Friend. Leah makes comments like eat a burger, skinny! Whenever we go out. For months. It was relentless, but weirdly affectionate. You're gonna blow away. Real women have curves. Bones are for dogs. Every meal with commentary how are you full already? Must be nice to eat whatever you want. from their guy friend group literally picked me up with one arm once just to prove he could. But it felt like belonging. Like finally having friends who cared enough to tease me. Besides bringing up my celiac seems dramatic. I'd rather take the skinny jokes than be the friend who needs special accommodations. Then three weeks ago, something shifted. The comments stopped. No more eat a burger jokes, no more grabbing my wrists. Instead, they got weird, careful, like they were walking on eggshells. Leah started buying extra snacks for the Room, casually leaving them on my desk. Sophie stopped making the metabolism jokes based with random compliments about my personality. Olivia began suggesting restaurants with lots of options. When we went out Thursday night, I'm coming back early from Bio Lab, and I hear them through the door. Our whole crew is in there. Leah, Sophie, Olivia, Jade, Addison. They never hang without me. Saturday at the pregame, before everyone else shows up, Leah's saying we have to be supportive but direct. The signs were all there. Jade says she never finishes meals, goes to the bathroom right after eating. She's getting thinner. My heart stops. They think I'm bulimic. Madison adds something about nutrition labels and restrictive behavior. Leah's voice gets soft. Talking about doing this with love. They're planning an intervention for me. I text Sam from home about what I just heard. She asks what they could possibly be staging an intervention for, and when I tell her they think I'm bulimic, she points out the obvious. It's because of my celiac. But they don't know about that. She tells me to just tell them. But I have a better idea. I'm going to make a point. Saturday arrives. I've been at the library all day, giving them time to set up. At 5:45, I hit up the only gluten free place in town and order everything. Three pizza is garlic bread brownies. At six PM, I walk in with my hall plus vodka. My friends are Arranged in our common room in a suspicious circle. Leah is in the middle, looking nervous. Sophie has tissues ready. Olivia is holding printed Webmd articles. Hey, babes. Ready to pregame? I brought pizza. The confusion is instant. I start unpacking, opening the first box. I wanted to talk first. Leah says carefully. Sure. I grab a slice, taking a huge bite. What's up? They exchange looks. Sophie takes a breath. We're worried about you. Oh, my god, me too. I say, grabbing a second slice. Do you know how hard freshman year is when you can't eat anything on campus? What? Olivia says, yeah. Turns out when you have celiac disease, eating gluten makes your immune system attack your intestines. Fun fact, I'm demolishing the pizza now. All those times you told me to eat a burger, I literally couldn't. I be hospitalized. Leah's mouth falls open. Celia, those bathroom trips you're tracking? That's after someone contaminated my food with gluten. Or when the dining hall mixes up spoons. Or when Tyler put beer in my juice as a joke. But you're so thin. Sophie whispers. Yeah, because the only thing that won't literally poison me is like.

When I was 14, I had been begging my parents for a service dog for months. My anxiety had gotten so bad that I couldn't even walk into school without hyperventilating in the parking lot. My therapist told them it would help, but they kept saying no. Dad always said dogs were too much work and too expensive. Mom claimed I was just exaggerating my anxiety to skip school. Dad would joke around dinner. If you're too anxious to go to school, how are you gonna walk a dog every day? So when my Jake called and said his friend couldn't keep their Labrador mix Scout anymore, I said yes without asking. Scout was already trained for emotional support stuff. I met Jake at the park that Tuesday and walked home with this golden brown dog, who immediately started following me around like we've known each other forever. My parents lost their minds when I walked through the door. Mom started yelling about responsibility and vet bills. Dad was pacing around the kitchen saying I couldn't just bring home random animals. They were so mad, they could barely speak to me during dinner. But then dad got this idea. He said I could keep Scout for exactly one week to prove I couldn't handle it. He even pulled out this little blue notebook and started writing down everything I did wrong day one. He wrote that I forgot to fill the water Bowl before school. Day two, he noted that Scout tracked MUD on the carpet. But something weird started happening First Night Scout was there. I didn't have my usual 3:00am panic attack where I'd end up crying under my blanket. Instead, when I started feeling that familiar tightness in my chest around midnight, Scout jumped onto my bed and put his head right on my chest. His weight was warm and heavy, and somehow my breathing just slowed down. The next morning at breakfast, mom asked why I looked so rested. I told her about Scout helping me sleep, but she just rolled her eyes and said it was probably. Probably just the excitement of getting what I wanted. Day three was when things got real. I had this math tutoring session with Mr. Peterson that usually left me in tears because I'd get so anxious about making mistakes. This time, I brought Scout with me. Mr. Peterson seemed annoyed at first, but then something crazy happened. Every time I started bouncing my leg or my breathing got fast, scout would gently pat my arm. It was like he could feel my anxiety building before I even realised it was happening. I actually solved three problems that day without crying. Mr. Peterson looked shocked. He told my parents later that he'd never seen me so calm and focused. Day 4 was the real test, though. I had to meet with Missus Collins, the school counsellor, because I'd been missing. So Many classes. Usually these meetings made me wanna throw up. But Scout came with me. He sat right next to my chair. And when Missus Collins started asking about my attendance, I felt that familiar panic rising. But Scout immediately put his paw on my leg and looked right at me. Missus Collins noticed everything. She watched how Scout would nudge me when I started fidgeting. How he'd rest his head against my leg when my voice got shaky. After 20 minutes, she asked to speak with my parents. That evening, she called them and said something that changed everything. My daughter is a completely different person with this dog. This isn't some teenage phase or a crutch she's using to avoid responsibility. This animal is giving her a bridge to function normally. Dad still tried to stick to his one week rule. He kept writing in his stupid notebook. But I noticed the complaints were getting smaller. Left scouts toy in hallway or dog hair on couch. Nothing about me being irresponsible anymore. Then on day 6, something happened that

The doctor said, no heavy lifting for eight weeks. I'm stuck taking care of him when I could be with James. I've been with Rachel for four years, engaged for 1. She'd always been supportive during my chronic back problems, or so I thought. After my neurosurgeon recommended spinal fusion, Rachel drove me to the hospital, held my hand during prep, and was the last face I saw before anesthesia. I have a weird reaction to anesthesia. I regained consciousness quickly, but remained physically still. I became aware in recovery, maybe 30 minutes after surgery. Eyes closed, breathing slow, but I could hear everything. Then I heard Rachel's voice near my bed. He's still out, she told someone. Before I could signal I was awake, I heard her friend. Ali arrived. How did it go? Ali asked. Fine, I guess, Rachel replied, sounding annoyed rather than concerned. The doctor said, no heavy lifting for eight weeks. I'm stuck taking care of him when I could be with James. James? I didn't know any James. Why not leave? Ali asked quietly. You're not married yet. Rachel paused, then his parents are adding me to their will next month. You know how loaded they are. The old man's health isn't great. Probably why they're updating everything. I just need to get out a little longer. My parents, my father, who built a construction company from nothing, My mother, who taught school for 30 years. The people who'd welcomed Rachel with open arms and insisted on paying for our wedding. That's cold, Ra, even for you, Ali said. It's practical, Rachel replied. Four years listening to him talk about building projects and football, playing nice with his boring family. And now I have to play nurse for two months. What about James? James will wait. Once everything is legal and Richard senior kicks it, I'll be set. James can have his fun now, but he knows the score. Richard senior kicks it. My father. They were discussing my father's death like a business plan. What if Mike wakes up and hears you? Ali asked. Rachel laughed. Cold, sharp, please. They pump him so full of drugs, he'll be lucky to remember his name. Besides, he trusts me completely. It's almost too easy. I decided to keep playing unconscious. The nurse checked my vitals. I woke up slowly, playing the part they expected. Rachel was immediately by my side. Hey, babe. Everything went great. How are you feeling? Tired, I mumbled. I'm right here. I'll take good care of you. The next few hours, Rachel played devoted fiance perfectly. When visiting hours ended, she kissed my forehead and promised to return in the morning. As soon as she left, I called my parents. Come immediately. It's important. But I'm physically okay. They heard something in my voice and arrived in 30 minutes. I told them everything. James, the Will the death planning? My mother gasped. My father's face turned red. We coordinated immediately. My friend Eric packed all Rachel's belongings into storage. A locksmith changed my apartment locks. At 11 p m, my father's attorney removed Rachel from all state documents. My mother called Rachel's parents. They were horrified. I texted Rachel, change of plans. My parents are taking me home tomorrow. Don't come to the hospital. Her reply, don't be silly, babe. I'll be there at 9:00. I didn't respond. Next morning, my parents discharged me at 8:15 a m. At 9:07, Rachel called. I didn't answer. By 10 a m, she called. Twelve

So I showed her I will not sustain her lifestyle. I walked through the door after another grueling 12 hour day, my shoulders heavy with exhaustion. All I wanted was a hot meal, a moment of peace and maybe some genuine time with my wife. Instead, I was greeted by that familiar silence and the distinct aroma of reheated takeout. Again, the dining table was cluttered with shopping bags from high end stores, their designer logos practically screaming expense. The irony hit me like a punch to the gut. Here I was, breaking my back to provide while she lounged on the couch scrolling through her phone, not even bothering to acknowledge I'd walk through the door. What's for dinner? I asked, trying to keep my tone light. She didn't look up. I ordered something. It'll be here soon. This had become our pattern. The home cooked meals were distant memories. The house was slipping into chaos. Dishes piled up, laundry unfolded, floors uncleaned. For weeks I worked extra projects, endured sleepless nights to ensure we lived comfortably. What did I get? A wife who didn't care about maintaining our home or acknowledging my effort. That evening I decided to address it. We need to talk. I can't keep doing this alone. I need your support. Her response hit hard. I didn't marry you to be your maid or personal chef. If you want that, hire someone. This wasn't the woman. I married. When I tried to reason with her, she dismissed me, saying she had better things to do than argue about nonsense. She wasn't just neglecting the house. She was neglecting us. I felt like an ATM funding her lifestyle. The next morning, something snapped. I don't think you understand how this affects me, I said over coffee. I come home exhausted, and I'm the only one pulling weight. She was scrolling her phone. I'm not your maid. I'm not here to cater to your whims. I'm asking for a partner, someone who contributes and cares about this relationship. Her laugh was bitter. You think this is partnership? I didn't sign up to be your servant. I have my own life. If you don't like it, that's your problem. What about us? Do you even care what's happening to us beside dramatically? If you want a housewife who does everything, you married the wrong woman. I'm not changing because you're feeling unappreciated. To her marriage was a transaction. My work financing her lifestyle while she lived. Responsible, ability free. By the time I got home, I decided if she wouldn't change, I would. I grabbed my laptop and logged into our accounts. While she watched TV, I canceled her extra credit cards, leaving one with strict limits. That evening, she stormed in, holding her phone. Why is my card being declined? I adjusted the limits. I said calmly, if you want to spend more, start contributing. I'm your wife. Not your employee. And I'm your husband. Not your bank. If you won't help

Mom chose her boyfriend Rufus over me when I was 16. He claimed I stole his Rolex, which was ridiculous since he pawned it weeks earlier for casino money. Rufus gave mom an ultimatum that night. Either she goes or I go. Mom didn't even hesitate. She packed my clothes and trash bags while I was at school and changed the locks. When I got home, my stuff was on the lawn getting soaked by sprinklers. I spent three weeks sleeping in a 24 hour laundromat. The owner eventually caught me, but instead of kicking me out, he offered me a job cleaning his other properties. That's how I met Mister Thief, a 73 year old man who was more powerful than I could have thought. His daughter had died at 17 in a car accident years earlier. When he found me scrubbing his toilets at 2:00am for grocery money, something in his eyes change. Within a month, he moved me into one of his vacant luxury condos. Not some rundown unit, but a penthouse he usually rented for $5,000 a month. Mr. Thys brought me dinner every night, helped with homework, and taught me the property business. Other kids were learning to parallel park. I was learning to negotiate lease agreements and manage construction crews. He paid for my prom dress, my college tuition, even walked me down the aisle at my wedding for Five years. He was the father I never had. When he died of a heart attack, he left me everything. 47 rental properties worth $18 million. I was 21 and suddenly one of the largest property owners in the city. I tried reaching out to mom once during those years. Invited her to my high school graduation. She never showed. Drove by the house one Christmas Eve and saw her through the window laughing with Rufus. I knocked for 10 minutes. She looked right at me through the glass and closed the curtain. Mom's sister called me when I was 25. Said mom and Rufus were begging family members for money again, asking if I had anything to spare. They've hit up everyone. Cousins, co workers, even Rufus's ex wife. I hung up and never asked about them again. Then yesterday, mom showed up at my office. No call, no warning. Just walked past my secretary with Rufus trailing behind. They look terrible. Mom had aged 20 years and 12, and Rufus's gut hung over his belt like he drunk two cases of beer. They stood in my office doorway. I knew immediately this wasn't about making amends. They were getting evicted at the end of the month and needed a place to live. Mom demanded I give them one of my properties her sister told her about. Rent free. Obviously because children don't abandon their parents. The same woman who threw me out like trash was lecturing me about abandonment. She even wanted her name on several deeds for tax purposes. When I said, I think about it, she appeared at my office building every morning with a sign saying, my daughter owns 47 properties, but lets me be homeless. Security dragged them out, but not before she yelled at the top of her lungs that I was mentally unstable and stole Mister Theese's fortune. She even showed up at Mister Theese's grave with flowers, telling mourners he was his real daughter. The woman who abandoned her child was trying to destroy the life I built without her. After 24 hours of harassment, I'd had enough. I called my lawyer and got the paperwork I'd hoped I'd never need. Then I asked my property manager, August, to drive with me to their apartment. I needed a witness for what was about to happen. The three hour drive gave me time to think about everything Mister Feast had told me. Success is the best revenge. But sometimes you need to show people the consequences of their choices. We pulled up to a

I found out when my new neighbour declared war on my sick daughter's magical night garden. My seven year old daughter, Lily, has a rare skin condition. To put it simply, the sun hurts her. She can only play outside in the deep twilight just as the last bits of sun disappear. Because of this, her world was mostly indoors. To give her a little piece of magic that was just hers, we built a special garden in our backyard. It was a moon garden filled with flowers like moon flowers and evening Primrose that only bloomed at night. We strung up soft twinkling fairy lights and for an hour or so each evening, Lily could be a normal kid in her enchanted space. It was the one thing that brought her pure joy. Then Mister Henderson moved in next door. At first he seemed fine. Just a quiet, grumpy looking man. About a week after he moved in, he installed a security light on the side of his garage. But this wasn't a normal light. Normal, uh, it was a commercial grade stadium style floodlight. A miniature sun. When he turned it on that first night, it blasted our entire backyard with harsh blue white light, completely washing out the fairy lights and bleaching the grass. I walked over the next day and knocked on his door. I explained very politely about Lily's condition and her special garden. I asked If he might consider angling the light downwards so it only covered his property. He just stared at me. It's for my security, he said flatly. I need to see my whole property line. I tried again, my voice gentle. I understand. But it's just so bright. It's ruining my daughter's only safe place to play. He actually scoffed. Not my problem. Your kid needs to toughen up. The world's a bright place. Then he closed the door in my face. The effect was immediate and devastating. The harsh light never turned off. Running from dusk until dawn, Lily's moonflowers, which needed darkness to open, stayed tightly shut, then began to wilt. She would just stand at her window, tears in her eyes, watching her magical garden die. The light was so powerful, it even cut through her blackout curtains, making it hard for her to sleep. My heart broke every single night. I tried everything. I called the city, hoping to file a nuisance complaint. Sent an officer out who measured the light. Mister Henderson had done his research. The light was exactly 1 lumen, under the legal limit to be considered a violation. It was completely legal. I even saw him watching from his window as the officer explained this to me, a smug little smirk on his face. He was enjoying this. He was enjoying taking away a sick little girl's only happiness. Two weeks. I felt utterly helpless. I was looking out the window at the Wilting flowers and my daughter's sad face. And then I saw my own reflection in the glass. The reflection of the light. And that's when the idea sparked. It wasn't about fighting the light. It was about redirecting it. That Saturday, I went to a specialty hardware store. I didn't buy fences or trees. I bought three huge 4 by 8 foot sheets of polished mirror acrylic, the kind they use for dance studios. I also bought lumber, heavy duty locking wheels and a box of screws. My wife thought I was losing my mind as I spent the entire weekend in the garage measuring, sawing, and building. I constructed three tall, sturdy panels on wheels, each one a giant movable mirror. That night, his floodlight clicked on at dusk, as usual, bathing our yard in that horrible glare. I said nothing. I just calmly wheeled my three mirror panels out onto the patio. The only sound was the soft rumble of the wheels on the stone. I took my time, carefully.

My dad is the quietest, most patient man I have ever met. He waits his turn in line, never complains about bad service, and thinks a heated debate is disagreeing on what toppings to get on a pizza. But I Learned that day that even the most patient man has a breaking point. And my dad's breaking point was a smug storage unit manager named Kevin. We were in the middle of a huge move. Our new house wasn't ready, so we had to put every single thing we owned into a storage unit for one month. We're talking my entire childhood in boxes. My mom's wedding dress, old family photos, my grandfather's war medals. Everything that mattered to us was in that 10 by 15 foot metal box. We paid the first month's rent on time, got our key, and didn't think about it again. A month later, our moving truck was scheduled to arrive at the storage facility at 11 a m. To load everything up. We got there at 10:30, ready to go, but our key wouldn't turn in the lock. That's when we saw it. Our standard silver padlock was gone, and in its place was a huge, thick, circular red lock. It looks like something you'd see on a bank vault. Confused, we walked to the front office. The air inside smelled like stale coffee and cheap air freshener. A man with a greasy ponytail and A name tag that said Kevin was sitting behind the counter scrolling on his phone. My dad calmly explained the situation. Hi, we're in unit 3B. It seems our lock has been changed. Kevin didn't even look up from his phone. Unit 3B, you're late on your payment. That can't be right, my mom said, pulling out her phone. The payment came out of our account two weeks ago. See? She showed him the clear as day bank statement. Kevin finally looked up, glanced at the phone, and shrugged. My computer says you didn't pay. So you didn't pay. He took a long, loud sip from a giant plastic mug. The computer automatically puts a company lock on any delinquent unit. To get it removed, you'll have to pay this month's rent again. Plus a fifty dollar lady and a seventy five dollar lock removal fee. My dad took a deep studying breath. I could see the muscle in his jaw twitch. Sir, we have proof of payment right here and our moving truck will be here in 20 minutes. We need to get our things. Kevin leaned back in his squeaky chair and smirked. Look, I just work here. The computer says you owe us money. Pay it or don't, your stuff stays right where it is. The condescending tone was what did it. My dad, ever the believer in process, asked for the corporate office's number. Kevin lazily wrote it on a sticky note. My dad called and Was immediately put on hold. We stood there in that stuffy office for what felt like an eternity, listening to terrible, tinny hold music. The moving truck driver called my dad's phone. Hey, I'm here. Where are you guys at? The pressure was mounting. My mom was starting to pace, her face pale with stress. After 25 agonizing minutes, a cheerful voice from corporate finally answered. My dad explained the entire situation, bank statements and all. The corporate drone listened and then said, I understand your frustration, sir, but we can't do anything from our end. You'll need the onsite manager to verify the payment issue and override the system. The onsite manager is Kevin, my dad said, his voice dangerously low. He's the one refusing to help. Well, I'd be happy to transfer you to his office line. The voice offered. And before my dad could protest, we were listening to a phone ringing on Kevin's desk, which he completely ignored while staring right at us. Call went to voicemail. It was a perfect, unbreakable loop of corporate nonsense. My dad slowly lowered his phone. The look on his face had changed. The patience was gone. He didn't say a word to Kevin. He just turned, looked at my mom, who was now quietly crying, and walked out of the office. We followed him to our old station wagon, thinking he

Where did you get the money? Family meeting tomorrow, six PM. They had no idea what was coming. I'm Marcus, 26, and I've been the invisible son for years. While my parents throw Celebration parties every time my younger sister Emma gets a participation trophy in her dance classes. I quietly became the youngest regional sales director at a tech startup, making serious money. The favoritism has been absolutely insane my entire life. When Emma wanted to try violin at 15, they bought her a two thousand dollar instrument without hesitation. When I asked for help with college textbooks, dad literally handed me a McDonald's application and said earn it yourself. When she decided violin wasn't for her and wanted to switch to dance, they enrolled her in the most expensive studio in town, paying 400 dollar monthly without blinking. Last month was the absolute final straw. Emma announced she's switching from dance to pottery because she found her true artistic calling. My parents immediately offered to fund a three thousand dollar pottery wheel, Kiln and complete studio setup. Mom was so excited she started researching pottery classes that same night. Already be planning Emma's artistic future. Meanwhile, I've been living off ramen noodles and sleeping on a mattress on the floor because they told me at 26 I should figure out my own finances and stop being a burden. On the family, when I asked for a small loan to help with a security deposit on a better apartment, dad gave me a 45 minute lecture about fiscal responsibility. The irony. While they were treating me like a complete financial liability, I been quietly crushing it at work. Three months ago, I closed the biggest software integration deal in our company's entire history. A Fortune 500 client signed a three year contract worth two point eight million dollars. And my commission structure meant serious money was finally coming my way. That's when I got my quarterly commission check. $47,000 after taxes from that one deal alone. Plus my regular salary and performance bonuses. Instead of being smart and investing it responsibly, I decided to make a statement that would complete we shatter their perception of my life. I walked straight into the Mercedes dealership that afternoon. The AMG C 63 S was sitting in the showroom like automotive perfection. Matte black paint, twin turbo V8 engine. Four 69 horsepower of pure German engineering. The kind of car that makes people stop mid conversation and just stare in amazement. The salesman initially treated me like I was completely wasting his time. Young guy in jeans and a hoodie looking at a 94 thousand dollar car. He barely made eye contact. That changed real quick when I said I wanted to put $30,000 down in cash and finance the rest. Suddenly I was his favorite customer. But here's the absolute genius Part I didn't tell anyone about the car or the commission. I just went about my normal routine for an entire week. And my parents continue their narrative about their struggling oldest son who couldn't get his life together. Then last Friday night, I posted one casual Instagram story. Nothing fancy, just a photo of my hand on the steering wheel with that iconic like three pointed Mercedes star clearly visible in the corner. The caption was simple new ride. My phone absolutely exploded within an hour. First it was Emma who screenshot the story and sent it with confused question marks. Then my mom called twice, but I let both calls go straight to voicemail. Finally dad called with a completely different tone. His voice was serious, almost suspicious.

My brother was born when doctors said my mom couldn't have more kids. They called him their miracle baby. I was 7 and suddenly invisible. For my 10th birthday, I asked to go to Dave and Buster's. They took my brother shopping for school clothes instead. Your birthday can wait, mom said. It never got rescheduled. By high school, the pattern was set. He'd break something, blame me, and I'd get grounded. He failed every class, but got a BMW for his 18th birthday. I was valedictorian and got a card. They skipped my graduation because he felt left out and needed a beach day. I stayed home during college to save money, working two jobs while finishing my degree. Every morning, my brother would jingle his BMW keys at me. Still taking the bus. Loser. After six months of overtime shifts, I finally had enough for a down payment. My friend's dad owned a used car dealership and cut me a deal on a blue Dodge Challenger. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. First thing I'd ever owned that my parents hadn't touched. I parked it in the driveway that night, put the keys on my dresser, and took about 50 photos. Even posted one on Instagram with the caption earned, not given. Next morning, the keys were gone. So was the car. So was my brother. He probably just borrowed it, mom said, not looking up from making His favorite breakfast. You know how boys are. He stole my car. Family doesn't steal from family. Three hours later, I heard the end. My brother pulled up in my challenger, except the front bumper was dragging, the passenger mirror was gone, and there was a crack spider webbing across the windshield. He tossed me the keys. Car is junk, bro. Fell apart on the highway. You should get your money back. I stared at the damage. You crashed it. Prove it. My parents immediately sided with him. Dad actually said I should apologize for accusing him of lying. Mom suggested I let my brother borrow it whenever, since he's used to nicer cars and did you a favor by testing it. I walked inside, pulled up my phone, and called 9 1 1. I'd like to report a stolen vehicle that's just been returned damaged. My mother lunged for my phone. What are you doing? Exactly what you do if a stranger stole and crashed your car. Cops arrived in 20 minutes. My brother was smirking until I pulled up the dash cam footage I'd uploaded to the cloud. See, I'd installed cameras the day I bought it, not because I'm psychic, but because I park it in a neighborhood where cars get broken into. The footage showed everything. Him hot wiring it at three a m, drag racing down the interstate, T boning a stop sign, laughing as he surveyed the damage, even calling his friend to brag About teaching me a lesson. The officers watched 30 seconds before cuffing him. This is grand theft auto and reckless endangerment. One said. The damage alone makes it a felony. My parents went nuclear. Mom screaming about family loyalty, dad threatening to kick me out. My brother just staring at me like he couldn't comprehend consequences existed. He's your brother, mom sobbed. Then he should have acted like it. The best part came during the trial. My brother's lawyer tried arguing it was a family dispute. Then the prosecutor played the dash cam audio where my brother said, I hope this teaches him. He'll

My Grandma Eloise was basically the queen of card games and causing trouble. At 91, she'd already buried three husbands, raised five kids, and spoiled 12 grandchildren rotten. When the doctors told us she had pancreatic cancer, we all knew what was coming. But nobody expected what she was planning. Two weeks before she died, Eloise called her lawyer, her doctor, and this magician guy she'd met at the casino. She told everyone she wanted her wake at her house, not some boring funeral home. Just one last game night with the family. We thought it was sweet. Like, of course grandma wants to go out playing cards. The day of the wake, we all showed up expecting the usual sad stuff. But when we walked in, there were these white envelopes taped everywhere with people's names on them. My cousin Jake got his first and opened it up. Inside was this riddle that said something like, where grandma hides her emergency chocolate stash. He had to go dig around in her bedroom closet. Everyone started opening their envelopes. My Aunt Linda got sent to the basement. Pete had to check under the garden gnome outside. My mom's riddle LED her to the attic, where she found this old photo album we'd never seen before. Each person found something personal. Grandma had been saving little treasures for years just for this moment. It was actually pretty amazing. People were laughing. And crying at the same time. Finding old letters and candy she'd hidden away. The whole house turned into this treasure hunt. And for a minute, we almost forgot why we were there. But then there was Rick, my sister's husband. This guy had been nothing but nasty to grandma for years. Always talking about how she was taking up space, how we should put her in a home. During Thanksgiving last year, he literally called her a drain on the family right to her face while she was carving the Turkey. Rick's envelope wasn't like everyone else's. When he opened it, his face went totally white. All it said was, look behind your mask, Rick. Inside was a thick stack of paper. First printed emails. Like, dozens of them. Turns out grandma had been saving every single email Rick sent to real estate agents about selling her house while she was still alive. The guy was literally trying to make deals behind our backs. But wait, it gets worse. At the bottom of the stack was a transcript of a voicemail. Rick had left this message for some agent offering him a quick under the table deal if he could get the house before the old bat croaks. Those were his actual words. My dad grabbed the papers and started reading them out loud. The whole room went dead silent except for Dad's voice reading Rick's emails about how he could finally get rid of the burden and cash In on prime real estate. Rick tried to snatch the papers away, but my Uncle Pete blocked him. Let him finish reading. Pete said his voice was ice cold. The worst part was this one email where Rick told the agent he was just waiting for nature to take its course, and then he'd have full access to liquidate asset.

Mom chose her boyfriend Rufus, over me when I was 16. He claimed I stole his Rolex, which was ridiculous since he'd pawned it weeks earlier for casino money. Rufus gave mom an ultimatum that night. Either she goes or I go. Mom didn't even hesitate. She packed my clothes and trash bags while I was at school and changed the locks. When I got home, my stuff was on the lawn getting soaked by sprinklers. I spent three weeks sleeping in a 24 hour laundromat. The owner eventually caught me, but instead of kicking me out, he offered me a job cleaning his other properties. That's how I met Mister Thief, a 73 year old man who was more powerful than I could have thought. His daughter had died at 17 in a car accident years earlier. When he found me scrubbing his toilets at 2:00am for grocery money, something in his eyes changed. Within a month, he moved me into one of his vacant luxury condos. Not some rundown unit, but a penthouse he usually rented for $5,000 a month. Mr. Thies brought me dinner every night, helped with homework, and taught me the property business. When other kids were learning to parallel park, I was learning to negotiate lease agreements and manage construction crews. He paid for my prom dress, my college tuition, even walked me down the aisle at my wedding. For five years, he was the father I never had. When he died of a heart attack, he left me everything. 47 rental properties worth $18 million. I was 21 and suddenly one of the largest property owners in the city. I tried reaching out to mom once during those years. Invited her to my high school graduation. She never showed. Drove by the house one Christmas Eve and saw her through the window laughing with Rufus. I knocked for 10 minutes. She looked right at me through the glass and closed the curtain. Mom's sister called me when I was 25. Said mom and Rufus were begging family members for money again, asking if I had anything to spare. They hit up everyone. Cousins, co workers, even Rufus's ex wife. I hung up and never asked about them again. Then yesterday, mom showed up at my office. No call, no warning. Just walked past my secretary with Rufus trailing behind. They look terrible. Mom had aged 20 years and 12, and Rufus's gut hung over his belt like he drunk two cases of beer. They stood in my office doorway, and I knew immediately this wasn't about making amends. They were getting evicted at the end of the month and needed a place to live. Mom demanded I give them one of my properties her sister told her about. Rent free, obviously because children don't abandon their parents. The same woman who threw me out like trash was lecturing me. About abandonment. She even wanted her name on several deeds for tax purposes. When I said I'd think about it, she appeared at my office building every morning with a sign saying, my daughter owns 47 properties, but lets me be homeless. Security dragged them out, but not before she yelled at the top of her lungs that I was mentally unstable and stole Mister Theese's fortune. She even showed up at Mister Theese's grave with flowers, telling mourners he was his real daughter. The woman who abandoned her child was trying to destroy the life I built without her. After 24 hours of harassment, I'd had enough. I called my lawyer and got the paperwork I'd hoped I'd never need. Then I asked my property manager, August, to drive with me to their apartment. I needed a witness for what was about to happen. The three hour drive gave me time to think about everything Mister Feast had told me. Success is the best revenge. But sometimes you need to show people the consequences of their choices.

I've been dating Sarah for four months. When she finally invited me to her older brother's country club, my entire body went tense because without her brother's blessing, we would never get married. Just warning you, she said, fixing my belt in the parking lot. He's been my protector since our parents died. My ex and senior year pretended to be broke while draining my accounts. So now Trevor still assumes every guy is after my money. I nodded my chest tight. What they didn't know, I owned a private jet company. I'd Learned money changes how people see you, so I kept my mouth shut and dressed casually. Trevor was already at the driving range when we arrived and the way he looked me up and down made it clear he'd already written me off. He wore head to toe Ralph Lauren like he was sponsored. And his handshake was the kind meant to establish dominance. After the crushing grip, he announced my hands felt soft, like someone who'd never done real work. Then asked if I even knew how to hold a club or if Sarah would have to teach me. Like a child. After we teed off, he made sure I walked while he and Sarah took the cart. Throughout the first three holes, he kept grabbing my shoulders and repositioning them, talking to Sarah over my head about how Proper lessons cost money. I clearly didn't have. My phone buzzed constantly with calls from my operations team. I switched to D&D, but Trevor noticed. Turn that thing off, he commanded. What? Doordash needs you back online. He laughed at his own joke. At the fourth hole while Sarah was lining up her putt, Trevor pulled out his phone and started showing me photos of every successful guy who was a member there, all single, all interested in Sarah. When Sarah tried to change the subject, Trevor grabbed her hand. I understand you're settling because you're scared your ex David hurt you. So now you're dating down where it's safe. He looked straight at me. No offense, but she needs someone on her level. My jaw clenched as Trevor turned back to me, his confidence growing with each insult that went unchallenged. Look at this. What happens if someone threatens you? This gonna protect you. He grabbed my arm, squeezing my bicep. Nothing. Probably can't even open a pickle jar. My jaw clenched as Trevor turned back to me, his confidence growing with each insult that went unchallenged. You know what's funny? He circled me like a predator. There is literally the only woman who'd give you a second look and that's just because she's traumatized from our parents. He actually lifted my chin with his finger, examining my face. Things escalated when a group of women from the club walked by. Trevor literally pushed me toward them. Ladies, quick. Poll, would you date this guy? They looked uncomfortable as he continued. You can be honest with me. On a scale of one to 10, one muttered, excuse, excuse me. And they hurried away. See, he turned to Sarah. Even strangers can tell he's not husband material. Trevor, please stop, Sarah pleaded. But he was on a roll. Let's talk about your future, kids, he said. His voice getting crueler. You really want this as their father? He grabbed my wrist, holding it up. These soft hands teaching them to throw this weak voice, telling bedtime stories. He actually got in my face close enough I could smell his Cologne. First day of school, other kids asking why their dad looks like the substitute teacher, why daddy can't coach the Little League, why mommy settled. My phone rang again. Trevor answered it before I could move, putting it on speaker with a smirk. The panicked voice of my operations manager filled the air, announcing something about a CEO. Furious.

I was 19 and completely broke. Like, checking couch cushions for quarters broke. My dad had just been laid off from the factory, and my mom's cleaning job barely covered rent. I was working at this grimy diner called Polly's Off Route 47, making $7 25 an hour, plus whatever tips truckers felt like leaving. Usually wasn't much. One Tuesday night in November, this old guy came in around 11 p m. Looked homeless, honestly. Dirty flannel jacket who's held together with duct tape. Hadn't shaved in weeks. He sat at the counter and stared at the menu for like 10 minutes. Finally ordered just a black coffee, 50 cents back then. I watched him count out exact change from this worn leather pouch. All pennies and nickels. His hands were shaking from the cold. The diner was dead that night. Just him and me and the cook, who was half asleep in the back. Something about him reminded me of my grandpa before he died. Same tired eyes, same way of folding his hands around a warm cup. I grabbed a plate and loaded it with eggs, bacon, toast, hash Browns. Basically everything we were about to throw out anyway. Set it in front of him. I didn't order this, he said, real quiet. Kitchen mistake. I lied. Got a toss it otherwise. He looked at me for a long moment, then his eyes got watery. And he just nodded, ate every single bite like it was his last meal. When he left, he pushed a crumpled dollar Bill across the counter. I tried to give it back, but he. It was already out the door. The dollar had something written on it in blue Pen. Angels Walk Among Us, Roy. I shoved it in my apron and forgot about it. Fast forward 11 years. I'm 30 now, working as a dental hygienist. The city, good job, decent apartment. Finally got my life together. My boyfriend Damon had just proposed the week before, and we were looking at houses. We fell in love with this place in Riverside Heights. Way out of our budget, but perfect. 3 bedrooms, big yard, original hardwood floors. The seller was some investment company called Bauer Holdings. We. They offered asking price even though it meant emptying our savings and taking on a huge mortgage. Two days later, our realtor called. You're not going to believe this. She said they rejected three higher offers and accepted yours. No conditions. They want to close next week. I thought it was a scam. Who takes a lower offer? But everything checked out. We signed papers at this fancy law office downtown. The whole thing felt surreal. Closing day, the lawyer handed me an envelope along with the keys. The seller requested you receive this personally, she said inside was a handwritten note on expensive stationery. Miss Rivera, you probably don't remember me. November 2013. Polly's Diner, Route 47. I was at the lowest point of my life that night. My wife had died, lost my job. Been living in my car for two months. Was planning to end it all after that coffee. Then you gave me that plate of food. Not because you had to. Not because I asked. Just because you saw someone hurting. That small kindness changed everything. Made me realize people still cared.

My 14 year old son thinks he's a master of deception, but he has no idea I know about his secret YouTube channel. I discovered it by accident when I was cleaning his room and found a crumpled receipt for a 300 dollar microphone. First I was furious. We just had a talk about responsible spending. But before confronting him, I decided to do some digging. That night after he went to bed, I searched his browser history. There it was, a gaming channel with 50,000 subscribers. My quiet, introverted son who barely I spoke at family dinners was absolutely electric on camera, cracking jokes and entertaining thousands. Instead of shutting it down, I decided to play dumb and secretly support him. Every time he went to study at the library, I knew he was actually recording videos in our basement. I'd intentionally make extra noise upstairs so he'd have to re record, teaching him patience. He complained about background noise ruining his takes. I suggested soundproofing his room for better concentration while studying. He started asking for odd things, green poster board, ring lights, a better webcam. Each time I'd make him present a detailed plan for how these school supplies would improve his grades. His presentations got increasingly elaborate. He even made a Powerpoint about how better lighting would help him read text books more clearly. The best part, every time he uploaded a new video, I'd watch It immediately my son would sit at dinner casually mentioning how hard his homework was. Well, I knew he just spent 3 hours trying to beat the final boss in Elden Ring. He got creative with his excuses. Once he told us he needed to join the debate club to improve his public speaking. In reality, he was practicing his commentary skills. When he won most improved speaker at school, I had to bite my tongue. His hundreds of hours of gaming commentary had given him more confidence than any debate club could. One day he mentioned needing a new chair because his back hurt from studying. I knew the real reason. He just hit 100,000 subscribers and was streaming longer. I bought him a gaming chair but labeled it an ergonomic study chair to maintain the charade. The turning point came when I overheard him on the phone with his friend. I feel bad lying to my parents, he said, but they'd never understand. Dad would probably just lecture me about wasting time on games that hit hard. Here was my son building something impressive. Afraid I wouldn't understand. So I devised a plan.

Emma had been best friends with Zoe since second grade. They did everything together, walked to school, ate lunch at the same table, had sleepovers every weekend. My daughter would come home with stories about their inside jokes and secret handshakes. They were inseparable. But everything changed when Zoe got an iPhone 15 for her 13th birthday. Suddenly, Emma wasn't getting invited to hang out anymore. At lunch, Zoe would sit with the girls who had fancy phones, showing off her new camera and playing games Emma couldn't join because she only had my old flip phone. I came home in tears three days straight, Mom, Zoe won't even look at me. I'm boring now because I can't text her or be in the group chat. It broke my heart watching my confident daughter shrink into herself. I worked two jobs just to keep us afloat after the divorce. There was no way I could afford a 600 dollar phone for a 13 year old. But seeing Emma's face every day, knowing she was eating lunch alone while her former best friend posted Instagram stories with new friends made me desperate.

Where did you get the money? Family meeting tomorrow, six PM. They had no idea what was coming. I'm Marcus, 26, and I've been the invisible son for years. While my parents throw Celebration parties every time my younger sister Emma gets a participation trophy in her dance classes. I quietly became the youngest regional sales director at a tech startup, making serious money. The favoritism has been absolutely insane my entire life. When Emma wanted to try violin at fifteen, they bought her a two thousand dollar instrument without hesitation. When I asked for help with college textbook, dad literally handed me a McDonald's application and said earn it yourself. When she decided violin wasn't for her and wanted to switch to dance, they enrolled her in the most expensive studio in town, paying 400 dollar monthly without blinking. Last month was the absolute final straw. Emma announced she's switching from dance to pottery because she found her true artistic calling. My parents immediately offered to fund a three thousand dollar pottery wheel, Kiln and complete studio setup. Mom was so excited she started researching pottery classes that same night, already planning Emma's artistic future. Meanwhile, I've been living off ramen noodles and sleeping on a mattress on the floor because they told me at 26 I should figure out my own finances and stop being a burden on the Family. When I asked for a small loan to help with a security deposit on a better apartment, dad gave me a 45 minute lecture about fiscal responsibility. The irony. While they were treating me like a complete financial liability, I been quietly crushing it at work. Three months ago, I closed the biggest software integration deal in our company's entire history. A Fortune 500 client signed a three year contract worth $2.8 million, and my commission structure meant serious money was finally coming my way. That's when I got my quarterly commission check. $7,000 after taxes from that one deal alone. Plus my regular salary and performance bonuses. Instead of being smart and investing it responsibly, I decided to make a statement that would completely shatter their perception of my life. I walked straight into the Mercedes dealership that afternoon. The AMG C 63 S was sitting in the showroom like automotive perfection. Action. Matte black paint, twin turbo V8 engine. Four 69 horsepower of pure German engineering. The kind of car that makes people stop mid conversation and just stare in amazement. The salesman initially treated me like I was completely wasting his time. Young guy in jeans and a hoodie looking at a 94 thousand dollar car. He barely made eye contact. That changed real quick when I said I wanted to put $30,000 down in cash and finance the rest. Suddenly I was his favorite customer. But here's the absolute genius part. I didn't tell anyone about The car or the commission? I just went about my normal routine for an entire week, letting my parents continue their narrative about their struggling oldest son who couldn't get his life together. Then last Friday night, I posted one casual Instagram story. Nothing fancy, just a photo of my hand on the steering wheel with that I tonic three pointed Mercedes star clearly visible in the corner. The caption was simple new ride. My phone absolutely exploded within an hour. First it was Emma, who screenshot the story and sent it with confused question marks. Then my mom called twice, but I let both calls go straight to voicemail. Finally, dad called with a completely different tone. His voice was serious, almost suspicious. Mark.

So my little brother Jake is 13 and basically a genius. Like he's already taking college classes and gets interviewed by newspapers about his research stuff. Everyone always talks about how amazing and smart he is, and honestly, our parents have never said no to him about anything his entire life. The problem is he's turned into this massive jerk who thinks he's better than literally everyone. He talks down to people constantly and acts like everyone around him is stupid. It's gotten so bad that I cringe whenever he opens his mouth around other people. Lately he's been obsessed with this girl from one of his advanced classes named Emma. He talks about her constantly but keeps complaining that she won't give him the time of day. Every single day it's the same thing. He'll come home whining about how she ignored him or didn't laugh at his jokes or whatever. Last week he invited her over to work on some project together. I was in the kitchen making a sandwich when they sat down at our dining room table. What I heard made me want to crawl under a rock from secondhand embarrassment. The entire time Jake just talked over her. she'd start to explain an idea and he'd immediately interrupt with actually, that's wrong because or that won't work, here's what we should do instead. At one point She suggested researching something online, and he literally called her idea stupid to her face. Then he spent like 20 minutes just bragging about himself. He told her about every newspaper article he'd been in, every award he'd won, every smart thing he'd ever done. The poor girl just sat there, nodding politely while looking like she wanted to disappear. The worst part was when he asked about her career plans, she said she wanted to be a teacher, and he immediately started lecturing her about how teaching doesn't pay well and she'd be wasting her potential. You could see her face just shut down completely after she left. That day, Jake came into my room all confused about why she seemed weird and distant. I wanted to tell him right then, but I figured maybe he'd figure it out on his own. He didn't. Instead, it got worse. He started coming up with all these theories about why Emma didn't like him. First he decided she was jealous of his intelligence. Then he convinced himself she was playing hard to get. Last week he told me she probably only likes dumb jock guy because girls don't appreciate smart men. Today was the final straw. Jake was at the dinner table going on his usual rant about Emma, while our parents nodded along sympathetically. He said she was obviously intimidated by how accomplished he is and that most women are too emotional to handle dating someone smarter than them. Our Mom actually agreed with him. She started talking about how some people feel threatened by exceptional individuals and that Emma probably feels insecure around Jake's success. Dad chimed in saying Jake shouldn't change himself for anyone and that the right girl would appreciate his gifts. I couldn't take it anymore. I put down my fork and looked Jake straight in the eye. She doesn't dislike you because you're smart, I said. She dislikes you because you act like a condescending jerk who thinks everyone else is stupid. The whole table went silent. Jake's mouth actually fell open. You talked over her the entire time she was here, I continued. You called her ideas stupid, you bragged about yourself non stop, and you told her she was making bad life choices. Why would anyone want to be around that? Jake started getting defensive.

Your job is in the kitchen, he added. But it wasn't fair. Every Saturday, he'd take my brothers out to the garage to work on cars while I was told to help mom inside. They'd come back covered in grease, laughing about carburetors and talking about R P M S. When I asked to join, dad would pat my head. This is boy stuff, sweetheart. You'll have a husband to handle this. I tried to tell him it was unfair and beg him constantly to teach me, but he refused. Women get too emotional behind the wheel. Trust me, it's safer this way. My best friend, Gloria, couldn't stand the way I was treated. My aunt Jenna literally owns a mechanic shop downtown, and she agrees. Your papa's a little loco, but if you really wanna learn, hey, she's down to teach you herself. I hugged Gloria. Oh, my god, you're the best! We went to her store, and I was instantly blown away by her. Aunt Jenna was everything my dad thought women couldn't be. Grease under her nails, but still rocking the makeup and beautiful curly hair. Your father thinks women are helpless. I'll teach you everything. More than he knows. She smiled with a wink. And so every Saturday, while my parents thought I was at dance class, Jenna taught me in the lot behind her shop. Not just Driving but everything. How to diagnose engine problems by sound. How to change oil, rotate tires, break fluid. Emergency maneuvers. Your brothers might know how to drive, she'd say, but can they tell you why an engine's misfiring just by listening? After a few months, I managed to finally snag my very own driver's license, something I didn't really expect my dad to find out so soon. It all went down in the middle of the highway on the way to my brother's graduation ceremony. Some hot shot in a red sports car cut off an 18 Wheeler without using a turn. The truck driver slammed his brakes, jackknifed hard. The trailer clipped the minivan next to us straight into the barrier, then sideswiped us into a spin. My brothers and mom screamed in a panic. We stopped sideways across two lanes, cars flying past, going 70 just inches from our bumper. Dad sat there frozen, hands shaking, his mind completely shutting down. I unbuckled and shot forward from the back seat. Move! I yelled. He pulled his seat back and jumped into the back row. I got into the driver's seat and restarted the stop. Old engine carefully driving us to the shoulder just as another wave of traffic came around the curve. My family hopped out of the car, crying and throwing up on the curb. The truck driver got out to check on us while calling 9 1 1. Help, please! The woman driving the mini van Screamed. We all rushed over to her, grabbing the two kids in the back first. But when the truck driver tried to reach for the mom, he couldn't get the door to move. She was trapped. The van crushed against the barrier on the only side we could reach her. While we sat there thinking about how to get her out, I smelled it. That sweet, haunting smell Jenna taught me. Brake fluid mixing with oil on hot metal. Highly explosive. Step back! I yelled to everyone. Dad started to say we should wait for the professionals, but we didn't have time. I grabbed the truck's tire iron, disconnected the lower hinge first. I called out to the truck driver to support the door while I popped the upper pins. My brothers just stood there, frozen like. Dad, get the Jack on our trunk! Now! I kicked it in position exactly where Jenna taught me, under the dashboard's frame, the strongest point, and cranked it just enough to free the woman's.

You can figure it out. She shrugged. I stood there watching her walk away with her perfect little blended family, dragging their matching designer suitcases toward the gate. She didn't even look back, not once. I had $23 in my pocket, a dead phone charger and absolutely nowhere to go in this massive airport. That's when I remembered the business card tucked in my wallet, the one with the fancy logo I've been carrying around for three years. My Aunt Sarah's restaurant card. The sister my mom had been bad mouthing my entire life, calling her a jealous failure. Sarah's a pathetic loser. Mom always said she's jealous of our success and stability. Don't believe anything she tells you about our family. But standing there alone in JFK Terminal 4, watching families rush past me with their vacation excitement, I figured I had nothing left to lose. I found a payphone. Yes, they still exist in airports, and dialed the number with shaking fingers. It rang twice before a warm, professional voice answered. Bella Vista Restaurant. This is Sarah speaking. And Sarah, it's Maya. I'm. I'm in really big trouble right now. The silence lasted forever. Then in a completely different tone. Baby girl, Maya, where are you? Are you safe? What happened? I started crying right there in the middle of the busy Terminal. Mom left me at the airport. She took her new husband and his kids on vacation to Hawaii and just abandoned me here. What terminal are you at? I'm coming to get you right now. You don't understand. I'm at JFK in New York. You're all the way in Chicago. I can't ask you to Maya. Honey, listen to me carefully. I have three successful restaurants now. I'm not the broke failure your mother told you I was. Say exactly where you are. I'm getting on the next available flight. Four hours later, I watched a confident woman in designer jeans and a cashmere coat rush through the arrivals gate, scanning the crowd frantically. She looked exactly like mom, but her eyes were kind instead of cold. When she spotted me, she started running. I've been waiting 10 years for the phone call, she whispered, hugging me so tight I could barely breathe. I've tried reaching you so many times, but your mother blocked every single attempt. To ride to her luxury hotel suite was completely surreal. Sarah explained everything while ordering room service, how she built a successful restaurant empire from nothing, how she been sending birthday cards and Christmas gifts that mom apparently threw away unopened, how she'd even hired a family lawyer once to try for visitation rights. Your mother told everyone in our family that I was a drug addict who couldn't hold a job. Sarah laughed bitterly. Meanwhile, I've been featured in Chicago magazine as Entrepreneur of the year, two years running. That night in the hotel, Sarah showed me years worth of returned letters with refused photos of elaborate birthday cake she'd made for me each year and bank statements proving she'd been setting aside money for my college fund since I was born. I'm not letting you go back to that toxic woman, she said firmly. We're calling my lawyer first thing tomorrow morning. The emergency custody hearing was swift and decisive when the family.

Where did you get the money? Family meeting tomorrow, six PM. They had no idea what was coming. I'm Marcus, 26, and I've been the invisible son for years. While my parents throw Celebration parties every time my younger sister Emma gets a participation trophy in her dance classes. I quietly became the youngest regional sales director at a tech startup, making serious money. The favoritism has been absolutely insane my entire life. When Emma wanted to try violin at fifteen, they bought her a two thousand dollar instrument without hesitation. When I asked for help with college textbook, dad literally handed me a McDonald's application and said earn it yourself. When she decided violin wasn't for her and wanted to switch to dance, they enrolled her in the most expensive studio in town, paying 400 dollar monthly without blinking. Last month was the absolute final straw. Emma announced she's switching from dance to pottery because she found her true artistic falling. My parents immediately offered to fund a three thousand dollar pottery wheel, Kiln and complete studio setup. Mom was so excited she started researching pottery classes that same night, already planning Emma's artistic future. Meanwhile, I've been living off ramen noodles and sleeping on a mattress on the floor because they told me at 26 I should figure out my own finances and stop being a burden on the Family. When I asked for a small loan to help with a security deposit on a better apartment, dad gave me a 45 minute lecture about fiscal responsibility. The irony. While they were treating me like a complete financial liability, I been quietly crushing it at work. Three months ago, I closed the biggest software integration deal in our company's entire history. A Fortune 500 client signed a three year contract worth $2.8 million, and my commission structure meant serious money was finally coming my way. That's when I got my quarterly commission check. $47,000 after taxes from that one deal alone. Plus my regular salary and performance bonuses. Instead of being smart and investing it responsibly, I decided to make a statement that would come completely shatter their perception of my life. I walked straight into the Mercedes dealership that afternoon. The AMG C 60 three S was sitting in the showroom like Automotive Perfection. Matte black paint, twin turbo V8 engine, four 69 horsepower of pure German engineering. The kind of car that makes people stop mid conversation and just stare in amazement. The salesman initially treated me like I was completely wasting his time. Young guy in jeans and a hoodie looking at a 94 thousand dollar car. He barely made eye contact. That changed real quick when I said I wanted to put $30,000 down in cash and finance the rest. Suddenly I was his favorite customer. But here's the absolute genius part. I didn't tell anyone. About the car or the commission? I just went about my normal routine for an entire week, and my parents continue their narrative about their struggling oldest son who couldn't get his life together. Then last Friday night, I posted one casual Instagram story. Nothing fancy, just a photo of my hand on the steering wheel with that iconic three pointed Mercedes star clearly visible in the corner. The caption was simple new ride. My phone absolutely exploded within an hour. First it was Emma, who screenshot the story and sent it with confused question marks. Then my mom called twice, but I let both calls go straight to voicemail. Finally, dad called with a completely different tone. His voice was serious, almost suspicious. Marcus, we need to talk immediately. That car cost more than most people make. An entire

The grocery store security footage showed my face hitting the floor. Blood pooled around my head where I cracked it on the tile. When I woke up in the hospital, I immediately threw up blood. You're literally starving to death, the doctor told me. I try to sit up, but the room spun violently. I need to get back to work. Rent is due tomorrow. She pushed me back down. You're 16 years old and you weigh 80 pounds. That can't be right. When did you last eat a meal? Three days ago, I think. She looked horrified. Where are your parents right now? In the basement, playing their online game, like always. They don't know you're dying. They told me not to bother them unless someone is dead. You almost were dead. Almost doesn't count according to them. She glanced at my chart. You work two jobs and go to school. I work at four in the morning delivering newspapers. Then I go to school, then I work at the grocery store until midnight. That's physically impossible. Red Bull and gas station pills make it possible. You're taking stimulants. I have to pay rent or we get evicted. Your parents don't have jobs? They quit two years ago to become professional gamers. Are they making money from gaming? I laughed. They've made exactly zero dollars. But they keep saying fame is coming any day now. How much sleep are You getting? My thoughts kept slipping away like water through my fingers. Three hours on a good night, but usually less. Do you ever feel dizzy or confused? Every single day. But I can push through it. She stared at me in disbelief. Your parents make you work while they stay home gaming all day? They're trying to build their streaming career. They need my support. She examined my arms, which looked like twigs. 40 pounds underweight because you're feeding them instead of yourself. You don't understand. They should be able to follow their dreams after the sacrifices they made for me. My manager, Jimmy, had been sitting in the corner listening. He finally spoke up, looking sick with guilt. I should have said something sooner. This kid has been falling apart for months. He has been seeing things at work that aren't real. The doctor turned to him quickly. What kind of things? Yesterday he was having full conversations with nobody for 20 minutes straight. I felt my face get hot. Sometimes when I'm really tired, I see shadows that aren't there. That's your brain literally shutting down from exhaustion. Jimmy looked broken. And last week I found him unconscious in the freezer. He had been in there for 40 minutes and had blue lips. I was just resting. My eyes have died, but I didn't, so it's fine. The doctor checked my blood work again. Your body is failing and you're still defending them? They're my parents. I Owe them everything. You don't owe them your life. Without me, they'll be homeless. Without them, you'd be healthy. The doctor called Child Protective Services and a social worker arrived within an hour. They tried calling my parents 23 times before anyone answered. The doctor put them on speaker so the social worker could record everything. I could hear battle sounds and screaming from their game in the background. This better be important because you just made us lose a ranked match. The doctor spoke calmly. This is the hospital calling about your son who collapsed at work. What does that lazy piece of garbage want now? He's in critical condition from severe malnutrition. My dad exploded. Of course. I should have just let him die when he was born instead of wasting 16

Everyone called me the calculator. Not because I loved math, though I was good at it, but because I could tell you exactly what score you needed on any assignment to keep your GPA alive. By senior year, I was basically running an underground academic consulting service from the library during lunch. It's started innocently. Sophomore year, Raj was failing chemistry and needed exactly 73% on the final to pass. I mapped out what to study, which problems to focus on, even which partial credit opportunities to exploit. He passed with a 74%. Word spread quietly. By junior year, kids would slip me their grade reports during passing periods, and I'd create personalized survival strategies. Never charged money, just traded for small favors, leftover cafeteria cookies, rides home when it rained, notes from classes I missed. I genuinely enjoyed it at first, watching kids faces light up when they realized they could still pass, still graduate, still make their parents proud. It felt like I was doing something meaningful. Then came senior year, and everything changed. Ashley was fighting for valedictorian, ranked first, while I sat comfortably at third. She came to me crying, mascara streaming, saying her parents would literally disown her if she lost the top spot. Her weakness was AP literature. I spent three weeks tutoring her, editing her essays until they sang, creating study guides that mapped every possible essay question. She went from a B+ To an A. But success made her entitled. She'd text at 2:00am, demanding I review her work immediately. When I said I needed sleep for my own exams, she'd remind me how she'd helped me get into National Honor Society, conveniently forgetting I qualified on merit alone. Other kids were the same. They ignored me in hallways, forgot my name at lunch, never invited me to parties. But suddenly, mysteriously, they all knew exactly where to find me when grades were due. The breaking point was Trevor, our star quarterback. He needed to maintain a 2.5 GPA for his football scholarship, but hadn't turned in a single assignment all semester. Instead of asking for help, he cornered me after school, pushed me against the lockers hard enough to bruise. You're going to do my makeup work, he said, not asking. When I refused, he smiled coldly. Then I'll tell Rodriguez you're selling answers. Who do you think she'll believe, the quarterback or the weird kid who's always in the library? He reported me. The next day. I sat in Principal Rodriguez's office, stunned as she lectured me about academic pretty while Trevor smirked from across the room. She couldn't prove anything, but the threat was clear. Stop helping people or face suspension that would destroy my college applications. That night, I realized the truth. I wasn't a friend or even a person to them. I was a tool, a calculator they could use and discard. The same kids who whispered Nerd, when I walked past, who made fun of my secondhand clothes, suddenly needed me desperately. The night before finals week, my phone exploded. 43 messages in two hours. Ashley had given my number to half the senior class. Emergency. Need help now, please. I'll fail just this once, I swear. I stared at the messages, feeling something inside me finally cracked. I opened my laptop and started typing. But instead of real study guides, I created something else. For each person who'd messaged me, I calculated precisely

My mother ambushed me during a board meeting. If you don't bring someone to our anniversary gala, I'm calling Missus Mendez about her daughter. She's very interested in meeting you. 12 board members suddenly found their phones fascinating, while their 35 year old CEO got threatened with an arranged marriage. After dismissing everyone, I walked past the break room and heard muffled crying from the bathroom. Through the door, I could make out Selena's voice. I understand, mom. I'll figure out the payment somehow. Just tell them we need two more weeks. Selena emerged with red eyes. She tried to hide behind her glasses. She'd been my assistant for two years. Never late, never complaining, always staying past eight with being asked. Everything all right? I asked, though we both knew I'd heard. She straightened her blazer and forced her professional smile. Of course, Mister Pierce. Did you need the quarterly reports? That's when I had the idea. Actually, I have a proposition, I said, watching her reaction. $50,000 for three months of work, evenings and weekends. Her eyes widened, but he stayed composed. What kind of work? Being my girlfriend. Fake girlfriend, I clarified. Contract basis, strict boundaries. We attend events together, hold hands in public, convince my parents I'm in a relationship. Three months until their anniversary passes. She stared at me for a full minute. You're serious? Completely. You need money for your Mother's medical Bill. I need my parents off my back. Simple transaction. Within a week, we had a 12 page contract. No feelings, no private touching. Three dates weekly. Public affection only when necessary. She slid the papers across. I added a termination clause. Either party can exit with 24 hours notice. I nodded. Remember, we've been dating three months. You call me sweetheart sometimes. We met when I started working here, but kept it professional until recently. Her voice was clinical, like reading a spreadsheet. The first month was flawless. Selena transformed into the perfect girlfriend at charity galas and family dinners. Ready, darling? She'd say with a bright smile that never quite reached her eyes. She researched my colleagues wives, laughed at my father's golf stories, charmed my mother completely. In private, we maintained exact professional distance. She'd brief me like we were preparing for a merger. I should touch your shoulder when you mention the Tokyo deal, she'd say. Review notes, show support. We memorize things about each other. Your favorite color is blue. You're allergic to shellfish. We met at a charity auction. For two months, we were like the world's most professional actors. We had eight weeks left. Everything was perfectly on track. Then came the storm. Thunder crashed through my penthouse at midnight. Rain hammering the windows. The sound mixed with rumbling. And suddenly I was 15 again. Trapped in our car as it hydroplane. My brother screaming, metal crunching. Then silence. The panic. Attack hit like a freight train. My chest locked, vision tunneling, legs buckle. I collapsed beside my bed, gasping for air that wouldn't come through the roaring in my ears. I heard my door opening. Selena's voice called out, Mister Pierce, you left these contracts. I thought you need them for tomorrow. She found me on the floor, shaking, drenched in sweat. Without hesitation, she dropped everything and knelt beside me. Look at me. Breathe with me. In for four. Hold out for four. Her hands gripped mine. You're safe. You're in your apartment. She pulled me against her fingers running through my hair, completely shattering our professional boundary. She stayed all night, talking me through each wave. Stories about her childhood, her college disasters, her mother's cooking. When the shaking stopped around four

Everyone stared. I stood up and said, then stop calling me when you need money. Her face fell and everyone stopped breathing. I'm Linda, 32, the invisible middle child. My older brother Michael is the golden boy doctor. My younger sister Karen is the precious princess lawyer. I'm stuck in the middle, desperately trying to earn a fraction of their attention. Growing up, I worked twice as hard for half the recognition. Michael got praised for b's while I needed straight A's just to get acknowledgement. When Karen threw tantrums, it was cute. When I raised my voice, I was disrespectful. When I chose marketing as my college major, my mother's face fell. Marketing isn't a real career, Linda. That's just playing with pretty pictures. Why can't you be more like Michael and choose something that actually helps people? But what my family didn't know was that I've been their secret financial lifeline. For two years, I've been sending mom $1,500 monthly for car payments when Dad's business struggled. When dad needed surgery, I covered $3,000 in medical costs. When Michael's student loans defaulted, I paid $4,000 my house down payment savings. When Karen needed $2,000 for bar exam fees after blowing her trust fund on Europe, guess who covered it every time? Mom made me promise not to tell anyone. It would embarrass them, she said. Meanwhile, at every family gathering, she dismissed my career and compare me unfavorably to My siblings real accomplishments. This past Christmas, I finally had amazing news to share. David had proposed in October. The ring was perfect. And more importantly, he saw me in a way my family never had. I'd also just been promoted to senior marketing coordinator with a significant raise. For the first time in my adult life, I felt genuinely proud of what I'd accomplished. Christmas dinner started normally. I announced my engagement, showing my beautiful ring to polite congratulations and forced smiles. When Karen asked what David did and I said he was a high school English teacher, my mother repeated, a teacher, like I'd said, unemployed, vagrant. Then came the moment that changed everything. You know, Linda, my mother said, looking directly at me, I've been thinking about this engagement of yours and I have to be honest, I'm worried about David. I mean, what kind of man proposes to you? The table went silent. What do you mean, I asked. So I was afraid. I already knew. Well, let's be realistic here. You're 32. You work in a job that barely pays the bills. You live in that tiny apartment and you've never really accomplished anything significant. The most useless child we have. I just hope David realizes what he's signing up for before it's too late. The silence was deafening. Everyone stared at me, waiting to see how I'd react. For the first time in my life, instead of shrinking back, I felt 32 years of Suppressed frustration finally finding its voice. I stood up slowly and looked my mother directly in the eyes. Then stop calling me when you need money. Her face fell as I pulled out my phone and opened my banking app. I'm talking about the 25th hundred dollars I've been sending you every month for two years to cover your car payments because Dad's business was struggling. I'm talking about the $3,000 I gave you for Dad's surgery when insurance wouldn't cover the costs. I'm talking about the $2,000 I sent for Karen's bar exam fees because she'd spent her trust fund on Europe. I started reading actual transactions. September 15th, 2022, 1, $500 to Patricia Walsh for car payment. October 3rd.

He abandoned me and our two month old son eight years ago because he wasn't ready for fatherhood. I thought it would destroy me, but I figured it out alone. See, my ex wasn't just unprepared. He was cruel about leaving. Packed his things while I was at my postpartum check up. Left a note saying he made mistake. Moved in with his coworker Lena that same week. The woman he swore was just a friend. Within a month, they were posting couple photos while I was selling my jewelry to buy formula. I worked nights at the hospital as a receptionist. $12 an hour paid my elderly neighbor to watch the baby. Some weeks I chose between diapers and groceries. Food banks became my regular stops. Meanwhile, he was taking Lena on weekend trips. Posted about finding true love. Never sent a penny for his son. Leon is 8 now. Straight a student, soccer star. Polite kid who helps neighbors carry groceries. He doesn't ask about his father anymore. Stopped asking at age 5. My ex showed up maybe four times a year. Always canceled last minute. Sorry, something came up. Work thing. Lena's not feeling well. Car trouble. Leon would sit by the window waiting. I'd make excuse. Traffic emergency at daddy's work. Eventually, Leon stopped waiting by the window. I went back to school when Leon Was 3, got my degree, got a real job, made real money and bought us a small house when he was 6. Last month, my ex got married to Lena. His mom sent me photos. I thought I should see how happy he looked. Lena's pregnant. Do any day. Starting his real family. His mom said, like Leon doesn't exist. Then two weeks ago, out of nowhere, my ex shows up at my door. Not to see Leon. Leon was at soccer practice. He came to ask for something. Lena had their baby three weeks ago, and the delivery went badly. She needed an emergency C section. Now she has postpartum depression. She can't hold the baby without having panic attacks. She won't get out of bed. His mom lives in Florida, but won't come help. Lena has no parents, so he wants me to watch their baby every weekday. Nine in the morning until five at night. For three months. Maybe longer if Lena doesn't get better. You managed fine with Leon, he says. Standing at my door like he has any right to be there. You know how to handle babies. The audacity was breathtaking. This man who ran away from his own crying baby was asking me to raise his new daughter. I work. I told him. Jobs have flexible schedules. You could work nights again or take family leave. Family leave? To watch his child while his wife recovers from what I went through alone. I Tried to close the door. He blocked it with his foot. Leon should meet his sister. Ophelia needs stability. You're already experienced, Philia. He named his daughter Ophelia. The name I'd wanted if we'd had a girl. He left his number and said to think about it. Then the texts started. Daily, sometimes hourly. Pictures of the baby. Guilt trips. Lena's getting worse. The baby's not eating well. They're drowning. I'm the only one who can help. Family helps family. Don't punish Ophelia for our past. Be the bigger person. Then came uglier messages. I was better. Vindictive. Poisoning Leon against his sister. No wonder he left me. I was probably why Lena got depressed. Toxic energy, bad karma. Maybe I should look at why I'm alone. After a week of harassment, I'd had enough. I decided to drive to his house myself the next morning at 6 a m. It was a three hour drive to my ex's suburban house. The house he bought with Lena. Four bedrooms, two

The mean theater kids at my school had no idea I used to be on Broadway. After three years of performing eight shows a week, all I wanted was to be a normal 15 year old at my new school, where nobody knew I'd originated the role of Sophie in the musical everyone was obsessed with. But then I walked into the auditorium and saw the popular theater kids clustered together wearing matching drama club hoodies. Queen Bee Madison looked me up and down while I signed my name on the audition sheet. Her face scrunching up, she whispered loud enough for everyone to hear that community theater rejects always thought they could waltz into their program just because Mommy said they were special. Her minions, Britney and Jade, giggled while Madison asked if I'd gotten my audition outfit from Walmart's clearance rack, pointing at my plain jeans and sweater that apparently screamed amateur hour to anyone with real theater experience. When I said I was auditioning for Sophie, Madison actually laughed so hard she had to grab Britney's shoulder for support. She explained to everyone that Sophie required years of professional training to hit those notes, not whatever karaoke bar preparation I obviously had. Jade pulled up the Broadway cast recording on her phone and played the famous act too solo that I performed over a thousand times, asking if I Even knew this was originally sung by someone who trained at Juilliard since age 7, I bit my tongue so hard I tasted blood because that someone was literally me, and I'd actually been training since age five. and demanded I show them my audition song right there in the lobby since we all knew I wouldn't make it past the first cut anyway. When I started the opening verse, she immediately stopped me and demonstrated the correct breathing technique while the others nodded like she was teaching a master class. She grabbed my diaphragm and pushed hard, saying I needed to feel the expansion if I ever wanted to produce real sound instead of the squeaky whisper I was apparently producing. He commented that my vowel shapes were completely wrong and physically manipulated my jaw while telling me to watch her mouth form the proper positions. During the actual audition sign UPS, Madison erased my name from the Sophie List and rewrote it under ensemble, explaining that even that was generous considering I moved like I've never taken a dance class. She made me do a pirouette right there to prove I could at least spin without falling over, then shook her head sadly when I completed three perfect turns, saying my technique was shopping mall dance studio at best. Jade videoed the whole thing on her phone while providing commentary about how my arms looked like wet noodles and my spot was non existent. Sabotage started when I went to change into my audition dress in the bathroom. Madison followed me in and accidentally spilled her entire iced coffee down my front while gasping that she was so sorry, but maybe it was a sign from the theater gods that I should reconsider. While I was cleaning myself off, Britney took my sheet music from my bag and crumpled each page into a ball before smoothing them out again, making them barely readable. She sweetly offered to let me borrow her marked up copy, but every note was intentionally written wrong. When they called my name, Madison announced to the full auditorium that they were about to witness what happened when Disney Channel made kids think they had talent. She started a slow clap when I walked on stage, getting others to join in mockingly, while shouting that I should save everyone time and just mouth the words since we all knew I couldn't actually sing. Jade yelled from the back that her nine year old sister had played Sophie in their basement, and even she had better stage presence then whatever this was supposed to be. I started singing and Madison stood up in the front row, turning to address everyone behind her while I performed. She provided running commentary about every single thing I was doing wrong, from my posture to my projection to the way I was butchering the composer's intentions with my interpretation. When I hit the high note perfectly, she actually said Autotune must be getting really advanced. These

Now she wants her inheritance. I'm 54 and got divorced eight years ago from my wife of 20 years. The day the papers were signed, my daughter Sarah, now 28, immediately took her mom's side and blocked me on everything without even asking what actually happened. My ex was ruthless. She told Sarah I cheated, that I abandoned the family, I was emotionally abusive. None of it was true. She was the one who had the affair. But Sarah ate it up. I tried calling, texting, even showing up at her apartment. Nothing worked. Dad, I don't want to hear your lies, she said. The last time I saw her, mom told me everything. You're disgusting. Eventually, my ex threatened to get a restraining order against me for harassment, so I gave up. Those eight years were the darkest of my life. I moved to a smaller apartment, took care of my mom, who had alzheimer's and basically became a hermit. Had a few casual relationships, but couldn't trust anyone. When mom passed away three months ago, I grieved alone. No Sarah at the funeral, no one to share memories with. Just me cleaning out her house by myself. Then out of nowhere, last week, unknown number calls me. Dad, it's Sarah. I saw on Facebook that grandma passed. Are you okay? My heart nearly exploded. After eight years of silence, I thought she finally came around. Maybe losing grandma made her realize Life's too short to hold grudges. We talked for an hour. She suggested dinner at my place. I was so nervous. I cleaned the apartment three times and bought her favorite wine from when she was in college. Opening that door was surreal. She looked so different. Older. More like her mother. Dinner was awkward, but good. We caught up on her job, her fiance, small talk. Then we got to the elephant in the room. Dad, I need to apologize, he said. I realize now that mom probably exaggerated things during the divorce. I should have heard your side. For a moment, I felt hopeful. Maybe this was genuine. Then she dropped a nuke. So anyway, I was wondering about Grandma's will. I figured you'd have been contacted by now about my inheritance. But when that didn't happen, then I thought I should reach out directly. My wedding's in four months, and honestly, we could really use the money. My stomach dropped. She didn't come back because she missed me. She came back for money. Sarah, your grandma left everything to me years ago when she got diagnosed. There's no inheritance for you. Her face changed immediately. The fake warmth disappeared. What do you mean, there's no inheritance? I'm her only grandchild. I visited her all the time before she got sick. You visited her twice in eight years? Sarah, that's not the point. She loved me. She would have wanted me to have something. I offered her a Few thousand for my own avings for the wedding. Her face twisted with disgust. She stood up, started pacing around my kitchen. You know what? You're exactly the selfish a whole mom always said you were. I'm glad you're alone. You deserve it.

Everyone nodded along. I unwrapped my gift slowly and said, that's why the snowball prize nomination letter came as such a shock. The room went dead silent. My mom dropped her coffee mug on the floor. My brother Kevin stopped mid by, made of his cinnamon roll. Even my grandma looked up from her crossword puzzle. Dad just stared at me like I'd grown a second head. See, every Christmas was the same routine at our house. Dad would make his little speech about how Kevin was the successful one with his fancy marketing job and new BMW. Then he'd look at me, shake his head, and make some comment about how I was still figuring things out at 28. This year was supposed to be no different. I was sitting on the scratchy brown couch in my old pajamas, watching everyone else open expensive gifts while I got a target gift card and a lecture. Dad was in his usual spot by the fireplace, coffee in hand, ready to deliver his annual disappointment speech. But three weeks earlier, something crazy had happened. I was in my tiny lab at the university, working late on this research nobody cared about. It was this super boring stuff about plant proteins that could help fight cancer. I've been working on it for six years, staying up until three in the morning, living off ramen and energy. Drinks. My phone rang at like eleven PM. It was Doctor Peterson from the Nobel Committee. At first I thought it was a prank call. Kevin's always doing stupid stuff like that. But then she started talking about my research paper and how the committee had been following my work. She said they were nominating me for the Nobel Prize in chemistry. Me, the family screw up who still drove a beat up Honda Civic and shopped at thrift stores. I made her repeat it three times before I believed her. The official letter came two days before Christmas. I kept it hidden in my desk drawer, not sure if I should tell anyone. Part of me wanted to prove dad wrong, but another part was scared he'd find some way to make it about Kevin instead. So when dad started his usual Christmas morning routine about Kevin's accomplishments, I just listened. He went on and on about Kevin's promotion and his new apartment downtown. Then he turned to me with that disappointed look I knew so well. That's when I pulled out the letter. My hands were shaking. As I held up the official Nobel Committee letterhead, I read the first line out loud. We are pleased to inform you that you have been nominated for the Nobel Prize in chemistry for your groundbreaking research in plant based cancer treatment. Dad's face went through about five different emotions in 10 seconds. First confusion, then disbelief, then this weird mixture. Of pride and embarrassment. Kevin actually choked on his cinnamon roll and started coughing. My mom was the first to speak. She jumped up from her chair and hugged me so tight, I could barely breathe. She kept saying, I knew it. I knew you were special.

Let's see if he can make it back. They laughed and drove away. I never came back. Standing at that Colorado gas station, watching their tail lights disappear, something inside me just broke. Five years of marriage, and Chloe thought abandoning me 300 miles from home was hilarious. No phone, no wallet, nothing. The gas station clerk, an older guy named Pete, saw me standing there looking lost. You all right, son? He asked. I explained what happened, expecting him to shake his head and walk away. Instead, he handed me a bottled water and said, some people ain't worth the ground they walk on. He even let me use his phone to call the local shelter. I hitched a ride to Grand Junction with a trucker who didn't ask questions, found a homeless shelter run by a former Marine named Roy. He handed me a clipboard and said, fill this out. Tomorrow we figure out the rest. That night, lying on a cot surrounded by strangers, I stared at the ceiling, thinking about Chloe's laugh as they drove away, how Stephanie had said, he'll figure it out. He always does. Like I was some kind of trained dog they could abandoned for entertainment. Roy got me a job washing dishes at Jackie's Diner for cash. The owner, a tough old woman covered in tattoos, paid me under the table. You running from something? She Asked one day, watching me scrub plates like my life depended on it. Running to something, I said. Turns out Jackie had connections. Real estate connections. She'd been flipping houses since the 90s. Knew every contractor, inspector and banker in town. You got a good head on your shoulders, she told me after I caught an accounting error that would have cost her thousands. Wanna learn the business? Six months later, I was swinging hammers and learning to read blueprints. Becky taught me everything. How to spot a good deal, negotiate with contractors, manage cash flow. This ain't charity, she'd say. You're earning every dollar. Within two years, I owned three rental properties. Change my name legally to Marcus Stone. Felt right, felt solid. Found peace I'd never had with Chloe. No more walking on eggshells. No more being the butt of every joke at gatherings. I met Sarah at a hardware store. She was buying paint for her first apartment. Asked my advice on colors. We started dating. Slowly, carefully. When I told her my story, she just nodded and said, some chapters need to end before better ones can begin. We married three years later. Small ceremony. Just Jackie, Roy and a few close friends. Real friends who'd stick around when things got tough. Then last week, 15 years later, my phone started buzzing. Unknown No. 107 missed calls over two days. Finally answered. Mike? Oh, my God. Mike, is that you? I've been looking everywhere. Chloe's voice Desperate now? Crying. I hired a private investigator. It took months to find you. Mike, I'm so sorry. That day was the worst mistake of my life. My husband left me. I lost the house. The kids barely talk to me since the divorce. I have nothing left. Please, I need your help. Stop, I said quietly. You don't understand. I've been searching for you for years. I know you're successful now. I saw the business licenses, the properties. I know you can help me. We were married. That has to count for something. Chloe, I interrupted you

Don't walk with me. You'll embarrass me in front of my friends. I nodded and let her go ahead. But when she came back weeks later, her ride home wasn't me. Rosie and I had been together since college, but everything changed when she discovered social media fame. What started as posting cute outfit photos evolved into a full obsession with follower counts and brand partnerships. Six months ago, she quit her stable marketing job to become a full time influencer. We made a deal. I'd cover major bills for six months while she built her brand, using her savings for business expenses. Instead, her business expenses looked like shopping sprees, while she treated me like an assistant funding her lifestyle. This Europe trip was supposed to be her final push before she had to start contributing again. At the airport, I helped with her three massive suitcases. As we approached check in, she spotted her friends, Lauren and Ashley, dressed like runway models. They looked at me in my jeans and hoodie with obvious disgust. Rosie panicked. You can stop here, she whispered harshly. I'll walk you to security, I said, confused. She glanced at her smirking friends, then back at me with cold calculation. Don't walk with me, you'll embarrass me in front of my friends. In that moment, our entire relationship replayed with perfect. Every dismissive comment, every time I felt like an accessory instead of a partner. The love I felt for Her evaporated instantly. I didn't get angry. A strange calm settled over me. You're right, I said politely. I wouldn't want to do that. I let go of her luggage cart. Have a great trip. Then I walked away without looking back. She'd be gone three weeks. More than enough time. First, I sold the luxury SUV she drove entirely in my name, back to the dealership for a large check. And I hired a junk removal service to clear every trace of her from my house. Clothes, products, her entire filming studio in the spare bedroom. All gone. I changed every password on our shared accounts and removed her from my credit cards. Most importantly, I found her influencer website login and made myself the administrator by changing the recovery email to mine. I spent two weeks rebuilding my life, reconnecting with friends she'd found boring, doing things I'd stopped because they weren't Instagrammable. She sent me photos from Europe, Eiffel Tower, pasta in Rome, never asking how I was. I never replied. Days before her return, I used the car money to book a motorcycle tour through national parks. My flight left the same day she arrived. The night before, I sent one email. As per your request at the airport, I have ceased to be part of your life. Your belongings are in storage. Unit 42, first month prepaid. The car has been sold. It was my property. House locks changed. You're no longer a resident. I'll Be unreachable for weeks. Best wishes, Tom. From Zion National Park. Five days later, I turned my phone back on. To hundreds of missed calls and voicemails. My friend Dave gave me the breakdown. Rosie waited at arrivals for an hour before taking an expensive cab home with her suitcases. Her key didn't work. She was stranded on my porch with 300 pounds of luggage until her parents drove two hours to collect her. She launched a social media campaign.

So my little brother Jake is 13 and basically a genius. Like he's already taking college classes and gets interviewed by newspapers about his research stuff. Everyone always talks about how amazing and smart he is, and honestly our parents have never said no to him about anything his entire life. The problem is he's turned into this massive jerk who think he's better than literally everyone. He talks down to people constantly and acts like everyone around him is stupid. It's gotten so bad that I cringe whenever he opens his mouth around other people. he's been obsessed with this girl from one of his advanced classes named Emma.

The worst part was when he asked about her career plans, she said she wanted to be a teacher, and he immediately started lecturing her about how teaching doesn't pay well and she'd be wasting her potential. You can see her face just shut down completely after she left. That day, Jake came into my room all confused about why she seemed weird and distant. Wanted to tell him right then, but I figured maybe he'd figure it out on his own. He didn't. Instead, it got worse. He started coming up with all these theories about why Emma didn't like him.

When I asked why, she said, we didn't think you'd be interested since you're not the motherly type. I just smiled and said, you're right. I'll be too busy at my own shower next week. The look on Emma's face was perfect. Her mouth dropped open like she'd been slapped. See, what she didn't know was that I've been hiding my pregnancy for three months because I was scared something might go wrong again after my miscarriage last year. Emma and I used to be best friends, started trying to get pregnant around the same time two years ago. When she got pregnant immediately and I didn't, she started treating me differently. She'd make comments like, maybe you're just not ready, or, some people aren't meant to be moms yet. Whenever I mention doctor appointments or fertility tests. The worst part was when I finally got pregnant last year and lost the baby at eight weeks, Emma actually said, maybe it's for the best. You didn't seem that excited anyway. I should have cut her off then, but I was grieving and didn't have energy to fight this time. When I saw those two pink lines on the pregnancy test, I kept quiet. I only told my husband Jake, and my mom. We decided to wait until 12 weeks to tell anyone after what happened before. My doctor said everything looked good, but I was still terrified. Emma's baby shower was Last Saturday at the community center downtown. I heard about it from our mutual friend Casey, who felt awkward about the whole thing. She said Emma specifically told people not to invite me because she gets weird around baby stuff and it would be uncomfortable for everyone. When Casey told me that I was already 13 weeks pregnant and had just heard the heartbeat for the first time, I was finally starting to believe this might actually happen. That's when I decided Emma deserved a reality check. Monday morning, I called Emma and asked straight up why I wasn't invited. She gave me that not the motherly type line while sounding all fake sweet about it. That's when I dropped my bomb about my own shower. What do you mean, your own shower? She stammered. I thought you gave up trying. Nope, I said cheerfully. 14 weeks along, due in March. My mom's planning the shower for next Sunday at the country club. The silence on the phone was so long, I thought she'd hung up. Then she started backtracking hard. Oh, my god! I had no idea! Why didn't you tell me? We're supposed to be best friends! This changes everything! But here's the thing. It didn't change anything for me. Her true colors had been showing for months. The comments, the exclusion, the judgment. I realized I've been making excuses for someone who wasn't really my friend anymore. Listen, Emma, I said calmly. I didn't tell you because I've Learned to protect myself from negative energy. And honestly, after being excluded from your shower for not being motherly enough, I don't think we're as close as we used to be. She started crying and saying she'd made a mistake, that she was just stressed about her own pregnancy, but I wasn't buying it. Real friends don't treat you like damaged goods when you're struggling. The best part came two days later when Casey texted me screenshots Emma had posted in our college group chat begging people to come to a last minute get together at her house because she felt terrible about a misunderstand

Uncle Wayne was worth millions, but lived like a miser, constantly testing our family to see who was worthy of his money. Every holiday was an audition where cousins would compete for his approval like desperate contestants on a reality show. I'm leaving everything to whoever proves they don't need it. Announce at family dinners while everyone kissed his ass and hung on his every word. My cousins would bring him expensive gifts they couldn't afford, offer to clean his house for free, practically beg for his attention and validation. They'd research his interests and pretend to share his hobbies. My cousin Kyle even switched his major to business because Uncle Wayne mentioned he respected entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, I brought nothing and sat in the corner reading a book, completely disinterested in his little power games. Grace doesn't seem to care about family, he'd say loud enough for me to hear. Testing to see if I'd scramble for his approval like the others. You're right, I'd reply without looking up from my book. I don't care about your money either. Always made him pause. While my cousins were falling over themselves to prove their worth, I was actively proving my indifference. While they fought over who could drive him to appointments and grocery shop for him, I got a second job and started Saving every penny. While they argued about his will, I was building my own future. When they'd ask why I never visited Uncle Wayne, I'd say, he has plenty of volunteers. I found his manipulation disgusting. Watching grown adults debase themselves for money made me sick. I'd rather be broke with dignity than rich through desperation. My cousins thought I was crazy. Don't you want financial security? Anna would ask. I'm setting myself up without begging, I'd tell her. While they spent their weekends doing his yard work and running his errands, I was working overtime and taking online courses to improve my skills. While they were buying him birthday presents and Christmas gifts, I was investing in my education and building an emergency fund. The dynamic was fascinating to watch. The more desperate they became for his approval, the more he seemed to enjoy withholding it. The more I ignored him, the more curious he became about me. At family gatherings, he'd try to bait me into conversations about money and success. I'd give polite, brief responses and go back to whatever I was doing. I wasn't rude, but I wasn't performing for him either. Grace, what are your career plans? He'd ask in front of everyone. Working on it, I'd say simply not elaborating. This drove him crazy because he couldn't figure out my angle. Everyone else was transparent in their attempts to impress him, but I genuinely didn't seem to care about his opinion or his money. The day he died, everyone gathered for the will, reading like vultures.

My brother and I used to bet on everything. Not for money, just dumb sibling stuff. Last one to the car is a loser. First one to the couch picks the movie. Last one to the shower smells like feet, that kind of thing. But our most sacred, most legendary competition. The toilet dash. It started when we were kids, maybe 8 and 10. After a long family road trip, we both sprinted inside, racing for the bathroom like our bladders were gonna burst. He got there first, slammed the door shut behind him, and shouted, I win! I get to pick dinner! No one had even agreed on that rule, but it stuck. From then on, every time we got home from somewhere, a movie, school, a soccer, her game, we'd shout some variation of, first one to the toilet gets to pick the pizza! Last one to the toilet has to clean up dog poop. First one to the toilet gets bragging rights. We never actually enforced the rules. It wasn't about winning anything. It was about the bit. The inside joke. The sheer absurdity of sprinting full speed through the hallway, knocking into furniture, nearly tearing door. It's off hinges, just to be first to pee. Our parents hated it. Mom once yelled, you're going to break something important! Dad replied, like their bladders! We thought he was hilarious. We kept it up for years. Even As teenagers, even when we were too cool for most things, somehow this one joke always made the cut. And then it just faded. We got older, busier. He started driving. I got into music. He had a job and college occurrences to worry about. Somewhere along the way, we stopped yelling Toilet Dash! When we came home, the silence didn't feel weird at first. It just felt like growing up. But a few months ago, something changed. We were coming back from a long day helping our cousin move into her apartment. We were hot, tired, and both half dehydrated from lifting furniture and pretending we knew how to assemble IKEA beds. As we walked through the front door, I smiled and shouted instinctively. Last one to the toilet has to buy dinner. I took off running full speed, skidded into the hallway, laughing like an idiot, slammed the bathroom door behind me. No footsteps followed. I waited, expecting a bang on the door, a hey. I was closer, something. But nothing. I came out and found him standing in the living room, still holding his water bottle, not moving. I nudged him. You lose, man. Better Venmo me for that pizza. He forced to laugh. Now you can have it. Didn't think much of it at the time. Just figured he was tired, maybe he really didn't need to go. Whatever. A week later, we were at the mall. I almost did it again. Almost yelled it in The parking lot. But I stopped myself. For some reason, it didn't feel right. Then, a few days after that, I went to grab my phone charger from his room. His door was slightly open and he didn't see me walk in. He was sitting on the edge of his bed, head in his hands. His phone was on speaker. I froze when I heard the voice. A doctor, calm, measured. So we'll monitor the progression, but based on your scans, it's likely you'll experience increasing pressure around the lower spine. That may explain the numbness and the urgency symptoms you described. My stomach dropped. He mumbled something I couldn't hear. The doctor continued. I understand.

So I'm at this party and everyone's bragging about their hidden talents. One guy can juggle, another solves a Rubik's cube in under a minute. My turn comes, and my brain decides to betray me. I blurted out I can control stoplights with my mind. Dead silence. Then someone goes, prove it. Any sane person would laugh it off, but no. I lead everyone outside like I'm about to perform sorcery. At the crosswalk, I close my eyes, press two fingers to my temple, and whisper, change. And right on cue, pure luck. The light flips green. The crowd loses their minds. Someone screams, he's real! They want more! I do it again, still pretending, and somehow it works. Cars honk, pedestrians cheer. At this point, I look less like a magician and more like a knockoff Jedi doing traffic control than chaos. My drunk buddy dares me, make them all green. I wave my arms like I'm summoning demons, and as if the universe hates me, all four directions turn green. Cars lurch forward, horns blaring, people sprinting like it's the apocalypse. My friends are chanting, Light Lord, Light Lord! While I'm praying no one dies. Police roll up. One officer squints at me and goes, alright, how long you've been working for the Illuminati? His partner mutters, ask him to do yellow. Nobody can do yellow. Meanwhile, I'm sweating like a busted street lamp. So, yeah, one dumb lie about stoplights, and now the cops are convinced I'm some kind of a government experiment.

She said, I'm not ready to close doors. What if someone better comes along? I was coming upstairs with groceries and heard everything. I left the groceries and her house key on the counter. Rachel and I had been together for three years. We were 30 and 33, spending four to five nights a week together, had keys to each other's apartments, and I was planning to propose in the spring. I'd already been ring shopping, found a vintage solitaire I knew she'd love at a jeweler downtown. She was smart, funny, had her life together. I felt like I'd lucked out. What I didn't realize was how often Rachel made comments that should have been red flags. When her friend Sarah got engaged, she said, I just can't imagine settling down with the first decent guy who comes along. When we'd watch romantic movies, she'd critique the couples. She could do so much better. Or, he's nice, but where's the passion? I'd rationalize these comments as her being thoughtful about commitment, maybe even mature for taking marriage seriously. Looking back, I was willfully blind to what she was really saying. We'd even book a trip to Italy for our fourth anniversary in March. $4,000 worth of flights and hotels I'd put on my credit card because she was tight on cash that month. She promised to pay me back, but like many of her promises, it was always next paycheck. Or after my bonus. That December, we were staying at her mom Carol's house for her birthday. Rachel had forgotten ingredients for dinner, so I volunteered to drive to the store in the snow. I spent 40 minutes getting everything, plus flowers for Carol, because I genuinely cared about this family I thought would become mine. Their house has a split level entry. You come through the garage, up steps into the kitchen. The living room is right off the kitchen with no separation. I just opened the door and was halfway up when I heard Carol. So when is Matt going to propose you? You have been together forever. I paused, curious about Rachel's answer. Mom, seriously, not this again. What? You're not getting any younger. He's a good man. Stable job, treats you well. Yeah, that's great, but I'm not ready to close doors. You know? What if someone better comes along? That's a good guy, but I don't know if he's my forever guy. I froze on those steps, grocery bags suddenly feeling like they weighed a thousand pounds. Carol responded, that's a terrible way to think, Rachel. You can't keep people as backups. I'm not saying he's a backup. He's safe, dependable. But sometimes I wonder if there's more excitement out there. Like, what if I'm settling? What if there's someone who makes my heart race the way Matt used to, but doesn't anymore? I mean, he's talking about marriage, and I just freeze up. Not Because I don't love him. But because I keep thinking, is this it? Is this the best I can do? Three years I'd invested in someone who saw me as a safe option while she waited for someone better. My phone blew up 20 minutes later. Texts and calls. I texted back. Once I heard what you said to your mom, we're done. I'll get my things next week when you're at work. Then I muted her. The next morning, I had 37 missed calls and endless texts. Rachel insisting I misunderstood, that she loved me, that she was just dealing with pressure. I didn't respond. Instead, I called her sister, Jess, 27, a personal trainer I'd met at family gatherings but never really hung out with alone. Tuesday, I went to Rachel's with some buddies to collect my thing. As we were finishing, Jess showed up, offering to help. Can't say I blame you, she said about my decision. I'd have done the same thing.

I replied, fair enough. Then I transferred all the vendor contracts to her father's name. The chaos that followed was glorious. I'd saved $35,000 for our dream wedding. Everything was booked in my name since I was paying. Then Sydney's parents decided to contribute. By contribute, they meant complete. We take over. Ronald wrote a 40 thousand dollar check, and suddenly everything changed. Cancel the mansion, use their country club. Ditch our photographer for their family friend. Triple the guest list for business associates. I pushed back. This was our wedding. Sydney pulled me aside. They're paying now. It's only fair they get input. Input is one thing. They're changing everything. They are paying 40 thousand dollars. Already put $15,000 in deposits down. They said they'd reimburse me. Spoiler, they didn't. The breaking point came when Lauren called, announcing she'd canceled our Italian rehearsal dinner and booked the yacht club instead without asking Sydney or me. We're paying now, so really, it's our reservation. I called Sydney about her mom unilaterally canceling everything. Stop being difficult. My parents are spending $40,000. It's their money, their wedding. Now they're paying, so they get final say. Those words, final say. Okay, I said, fair enough. Here's what Sydney didn't know. All vendor contracts were still in my name. Her parents had just been writing reimbursement checks, but I remained legally responsible. That evening, I contacted every vendor And transferred the contracts to Ronald Whitmore. Since the wedding was three months out, most were happy to accommodate. Thursday, I compiled everything into a folder and drove to their house, handed it to Ronald at the door. Since you and Lauren get final say, you should handle the contracts, too. His face went from smug to fused. When Lauren saw the financial obligations, her expression changed completely. These say we're responsible for all deposits and damages. Your wedding, your responsibility. You've got about $70,000 in outstanding balances due in the next six weeks. Ronald's face went purple. 70,000? You tripled the guest list. Catering went from $8,000 to $23,000. Heads up. This is insane. This is what you wanted? Your money, your final say, your contracts. Sydney called while I was driving home, screaming. Gave your parents what they wanted. Full control. You can't just dump this on them. It's their wedding, right? The fallout was SPECT Tacular. Ronald tried calling vendors to put contracts back in my name, but they needed my consent, which I wasn't giving. Sydney showed up, begging me to take back the contracts. The florist wanted $15,000 for her mom's orchid upgrade. I refused. Your parents wanted control. They got it. They're saying they won't pay. I guess there's no wedding Monday. Ronald called from his lawyer's office, threatening fraud charges. The lawyer quickly shut that down. I transferred contracts with full transparency, and Ronald had accepted them. Tuesday, the venue called Ronald's credit Card was declined for the five thousand dollar deposit. Without payment, by Friday, they'd release the date. I texted Sydney. Her response was a voice message of pure screaming. Wednesday, Sydney came to my office desperate to save the wedding. Her parents refused to sign contracts back over, figuring I'd cave and handle everything. So they're willing to ruin your wedding to win a power play? Just fix this.

What's wrong with my girl? I stepped out of the conference room already knowing something terrible had happened. Britney's voice was shaking as she explained. Nomi's fifth grade class was on their nature walk field trip in Riverside Woods. She'd eaten something at lunch and was having a severe allergic reaction. The nearest ambulance was stuck behind a jackknifed semi that had closed Route 47. The backup routes would take them 45 minutes. School's first aid kit somehow didn't have an Epipen, even though it was required. I was already running to my car while she talked. My hands fumbled with the keys as I calculated distances. The woods were 20 minutes away. If I drove normally, I could make it in 12 if I broke every traffic law. Nomi's emergency Epipen was in my glove compartment, where I always kept a spare. Sydney kept the phone on speaker so I could hear what was happening in the background. Nomi was crying and scratching at her skin. I made my foot press harder on the gas. I'd never heard her in that much pain before. Not when she broke her arm on the monkey bars, not when she needed stitches after falling off her bike. I blew through a red light, narrowly missing a pickup truck. Sydney was describing Noemi's symptoms to the 9 1 1 operator. On another phone. Hives spreading across her entire body, swelling in her face and hands. The itching so bad she was drawing blood with her fingernails. 10 minutes to the woods parking lot. That's what my G P S. Showed as I swerved around slower cars. But I knew the trail to the meadow where they held the nature walks. Another 15 minute hike through rough terrain. 25 minutes total. While my daughter's throat could be closing, Sydney's voice got more panicked. She says everything's getting blurry. She can't see right anymore. The mucus situation was getting worse, too. Sydney tried to stay calm while describing how it was pouring from Nomi's nose faster than they could wipe it away, like her body was trying to expel whatever poison she'd ingested. Through every possible route. The teacher was using up all their tissues and napkins. Took the exit for Riverside Woods at 60 miles per hour. The tires screamed as I barely made the turn. Behind me, I could hear sirens. Either someone had called in my reckless driving, or they were heading to know me, too. I prayed it was the second option. The parking lot appeared ahead. I skidded to a stop sideways across two spaces, and jumped out with the Epipen clutched in my sweaty hand. She's having trouble breathing now. It's getting worse. Kenny's voice through the phone sounded distant and tinny. I could hear Nomi wheezing in the background. The other kids were crying, too. Scared by watching their classmates struggle, the path split, and I took the left fork toward the meadow. My shirt was soaked with sweat. A branch caught my face, leaving A stinging cut. But I didn't slow down. Each second Nomi couldn't breathe, was potential brain damage. Through the trees, I finally saw them, A cluster of kids in bright field trip t shirts, surrounding something on the ground. I crashed through the underbrush, yelling that I had the medicine. The circle parted, revealing Nomi. Her face was swollen beyond recognition, eyes squeezed shut, lips blue. The wheezing had stopped, which was worse than hearing it. Sydney was on her knees, holding Nomi's hand, while the teacher tried to keep her airways open. I dropped beside them and ripped the Epipen from its case, pulled off the safety cap, jabbed it into Nomi's thigh, through her jeans.

My older sister, Denise, never let me forget. I was the family disappointment. Straight A's, student body president, Harvard Law School. She collected achievements like stamps. Why can't you be more like your sister? Became the soundtrack of my childhood. What no one knew was that while Denise celebrated her Harvard acceptance, I was quietly launching my first legal consulting business from my bedroom. By high school graduation, I had built a network of 50 law firms that relied on my research and strategies. None knew they were working with a teenager. By the time Denise graduated from Harvard Law, I owned controlling interest in seven major law firms across the East Coast through my shell companies. When Denise joined Preston and Hayes, Boston's most prestigious law firm, she didn't know I had acquired it six months earlier. She walked in not realizing her little sister was her boss. You should see my office. She gloated at Family Dinner. Corner Suite, partner track. Jack, what are you doing still with that consulting business? I smiled. Something like that. When I met Arthur at a charity gala, Denise tried to stake her claim. He's from Boston's oldest families. He's looking for someone successful. Not your scene, Anna. What Denise didn't know was that Arthur had met me as CEO of Mitchell Strategic Solutions. He was representing Blackwood International in acquisition negotiations, not realizing the CEO was the woman He was falling in love with. When Arthur proposed, Denise was livid. It doesn't make sense. She's nobody in the city. Something's not right. She insisted on being my maid of honor. To gather evidence, she spent months planning her moment of triumph. The ceremony was perfect. Boston's Trinity Church filled with the elite. As the minister asked if anyone objected, Denise Rose with a wicked smile. Actually, I have something to say. She pulled out a folder. Before we continue this farce, everyone deserves to know the truth about Anna Mitchell. My sister has been lying to all of you. She's been infiltrating law firms, manipulating business deals. I have proof. Bank records, shell companies. Getting back to her, she turned to Arthur. Did you know your bride isn't who she claims? That while you've been working on the Blackwood acquisition, she's been orchestrating it. She's not qualified to run anything. She never went to law school. You're right. I said standing, I never went to law school. I was too busy building an empire. I pulled out my phone and sent the prepared email. Throughout the church, phones buzzed as Boston's legal elite received the notification. Ladies and gentlemen, as of this moment, Mitchell Strategic Solutions has completed its acquisition of Blackwood International. This merger makes us the largest legal services corporation in New England. Denise's face went pale. What are you talking about? I'm not a lawyer. I own the law firms, including Preston and Hayes, where you've Been working. The folder slipped from her hands. That's impossible. Judge, could you confirm who owns controlling interest in your firm? Richard Hale stood up. Everything she says is true. Anna Mitchell is the CEO of Mitchell Strategy.

Mom wanted me gone. Three weeks later, police were involved. My husband's ex shows up at pickup after being gone for eight years and announces, you're done playing Mommy. I'm back. She hasn't seen her son since he was 4. Just disappeared one day to find herself and left my husband with a confused child asking why Mommy doesn't call anymore. Adrian stands there looking at their shoes while their biological mother explains how a kid needs their real parent, not some replacement. My husband looks exhausted and says, maybe she has a point. They should bond. He works 70 hours a week running his construction company. Which is why I know this is going to be a disaster, because I handle everything. But, sure, let them bond. I'm their mother. You just married their dad. She keeps emphasizing mother, like I don't know how biology works. Like I haven't been doing pick up and drop off and doctor's appointments and parent teacher conferences for two years, all while she was finding herself in Arizona with some guy named Carl. Well, I'm here now, my child. I don't need you. Fine. I pack up Adrian's special foods from my car, the ones for their specific texture issues, delete the 17 reminders for their schedule from my phone, hand her the inhaler I always carry because Adrian forgets theirs. She looks at it confused. He has asthma? She doesn't know her kid has asthma. Okay? I tell her, you're the Real parent I'll step back completely. She actually looks pleased with herself, but she has no idea what she's walking into. Day one Adrian shows up to school without their presentation that counts for 30% of their grade. X says kids need to learn responsibility. She doesn't know Adrian has executive dysfunction and needs three alarms plus a checklist. Day 2 Adrian eats cheese at lunch and throws up everywhere because X packed them a grilled cheese. Adrian texted me saying she asked since when are you lactose intolerant? Since always. I answered back for her. She'd know if she'd been here. Day 4 the teacher calls because Adrian punched the quiet kid. X believes Adrian when they say the kid deserved it for looking at them weird. I know the quiet kid is Adrian's only friend and they play fight as their weird inside joke, but I'm not the real parent so I say nothing. Now Adrian has lunch detention and no friends. Week 2 Adrian starts failing his tests. X doesn't know he needs to walk around while memorizing or their brain literally won't retain information. She tells him to try harder. Adrian gains 10 pounds in two weeks because X doesn't recognize their stress eating patterns. When AD and anxious, they'll eat an entire box of crackers without realizing. X just keeps buying more crackers. They're wearing the same hoodie every day and it smells like death. It's their favorite. She doesn't know it's their anxiety hoodie. And wearing it constantly means they're spiraling. Week three, the principal calls about concerning behavior. Adrian told the counselor they don't care about anything anymore. They're just being dramatic teens. You know, Adrian's best friend's mom calls me secretly because she still has my number. Your Adrian asked my kid for their Adderall. I thought you should know. X doesn't even know Adrian needs an ADHD evaluation. Doesn't know they can't focus without their specific routine. Then I see the scratches on Adrian's arms when I run into them at the store. Deep parallel lines. X says it's mosquito bites. In December? In Michigan? Friday afternoon, I'm at work when my husband calls, and his voice is shaking. Something's wrong.

That revealed something heartbreaking instead. I was teaching fifth grade in a small town when this quiet kid named Eli started showing up at my classroom door every morning. He'd wait there with this crumpled plastic grocery bag, looking nervous, until I unlock the door for the first time. It happened. I almost told him to wait in the hallway like everyone else, but then he pulled out this granola bar, juice box, and banana from his bag. Mister Carter, he said real quietly, can I sit in here if I share my breakfast with you? I thought it was the most adorable thing ever, this shy little kid wanting to eat breakfast with his teacher. So I said yes. It became our daily thing. Every single morning, Eli would show up with that same plastic bag, always the same three items. He'd sit at the desk closest to mine, and we'd eat together in comfortable silence. Sometimes he'd tell me about his weekend or ask questions about the math homework. I started looking forward to those 15 minutes before the chaos of the school day began. The other teachers thought it was sweet. That's so cute how Eli brings you breakfast, they'd say. I even bragged about it in the teacher's lounge. This kid is so thoughtful. He shares his breakfast with me every day. I felt special, like I was this kid's favorite teacher. After about two months, I noticed The food quality starting to change. The banana would have brown spots. The juice box felt warm. The granola bar wrapper was sometimes torn. One particularly rough morning, the banana was completely black on one side, and the juice box was so warm, it was probably spoiled. I was in a playful mood, so I teased him about it. You slacking on our deal today, buddy? Eli just laughed and said, nah, this was the best I could grab. Grandma says we got to stretch the fridge this week. That sentence hit me like a freight train. Stretch the fridge. I kept my smile, but my stomach dropped. I started asking gentle questions. Turns out Eli lived with his grandma and two younger siblings. His grandma worked the night shift at a factory and barely made enough to keep the lights on. This kid wasn't sharing his breakfast with me because he wanted to. He was giving me half of the only meal he was guaranteed to get that day because he thought it was required. When I asked him why he started bringing me food, his answer broke my heart. You said I could only sit in here if I shared. I didn't want to get in trouble. I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to cry. This kid had been going hungry every morning for two months because he misunderstood a casual comment.

Even before my parents signed the divorce papers, my older sister Cameron announced, I'm living with dad. He's got the corporate job making six figures. Mom's just a useless housewife who's been doing nothing for the past 15 years. I watched Mom's face just slightly before she forced to smile. That's okay, sweetie. Whatever makes you comfortable. Cameron rolled her eyes. It's not about comfort. It's about being smart. Dad's the one with actual money. She looked at me like I was an idiot when I said I'd stay with mom. Enjoy eating canned soup for dinner every night, she said, dragging her suitcase down the stairs. Mom watched her hop in Dad's car quietly and apologized to me for getting the wrong parent. I hugged her. You got this, mom. What I didn't know was that those words were the exact catalyst she needed to prove everyone wrong. Mom landed a job at target. Not exactly in a managerial position like dad, but she didn't stop there. Every evening, after cooking us dinner, she took online certifications. Project management, Quickbooks, data entry, whatever she could get her hands on. And within months, she moved from restocking supplies to a fancy new office job, bookkeeping for a local contractor, and later worked her way up to managing the entire back office operation. I was serious. Be so proud of her. Meanwhile, dad's situation was completely different. He couldn't balance his corporate job with actually parenting Cameron. He started missing meetings to drive her places, called in sick when she had school events. He spending hundreds on takeout every night, hiring cleaners weekly, paying for babysitters. Even though Cameron was 17, and the last time I saw him, he looked extremely frustrated. After months of repeated offenses at work, his performance tanked, and the promotion he'd been promised disappeared. And my sister completely oblivious to it, because as long as she had Dad's credit card in her pocket, why would she care, right? That is, until mom started her own virtual assistant business. She snagged her first client and quickly started handling five at a time. And I helped her however I could. When our clients reached beyond 20, mom hired her first employee, another mom who needed flexible work. The mom cried when she received the news. You're a blessing, she told her. They both worked hard to expand and hire more moms. And eventually, two years in, she had 12 employees and a real office space of her own, making more money than dad ever brought in. And as for dad, he unfortunately got laid off the same month mom signed the lease on her office. And my sister Cameron, following the scent of money, quickly jumped ship. After dad lost the nice townhouse in the city, my sister called us. Can I stay with you guys a bit? She asked in the sweetest voice. Mom immediately said, yes, of course. Family is family. Cameron arrived with her suitcases to find our house completely transformed. Mom had renovated everything. New kitchen, finished basement, the garage converted to a home office. Even the cars in the driveway had upgraded from Mom's rusty old truck to a beautiful silver BMW M4. And working under mom, I managed to snag a recently released James ACW Mini Cooper. My sister's jaw absolutely dropped. Oh my god, mom, you're so cool! She smiled. Thanks, sweetie. While Cameron went on and on about how luxurious everything was now, mom finally explained how living with her worked. Everyone who lives here works for the household, she said, passing the salad. That's how we built this. I nodded and told her how I worked on social media marketing, Mom's boyfriend Carl worked on logistics, even the college kid rent

Her friends were commenting laughing emojis, and girl, you're so real for this. I didn't say a word, just packed my things and left that night. Mia and I met at a music fest of all three years ago. She was a content creator with a growing social media presence. I'm a sound engineer for an indie recording studio, a job I love, but one that doesn't come with fame or fortune. Six months into dating, we moved into her rent controlled apartment. Everything seemed perfect, and the algorithm showed me something I was never meant to see. It was a Wednesday during my lunch break. I was browsing TikTok when a video appeared on my for you page. Mia in our apartment, lip syncing to trending audio about settling. I smiled, recognizing our living room, until I noticed myself in the background with headphones on, mixing a track. The caption hit me like a physical blow. Dating down builds character hashtag trust the process. As I checked the comments, my stomach dropped. Girl, oh, you're so real for this. The way he has no idea. Invest in potential, but don't wait forever. Mia's replies were worse. Got to start somewhere. The apartment is mine anyway. He's sweet, but this isn't the final stop. She'd film this while I was in the same room, captioned it to belittle me, and shared it with her. 67,000 Followers, people I'd never met, were dissecting my appearance, my career, speculating about my income. Everything suddenly made sense. Her reluctance to introduce me to work contacts, the way she's your conversations away from my career at parties for suggestions about more professional clothes. I wasn't her partner. I was her content, her charity case, her stepping stone. I didn't call her or text, just returned to the studio and focused on the session I was engineering. By evening, I made my decision. Mia was filming something in the living room when I got home. She smiled, paused her recording. Hey, thought we could order Thai Tonight? I nodded, walked past her to the bedroom. While she finished her content, I quietly packed a suitcase. Essentials. Clothes, documents, laptop. I took nothing that could be considered ours. When I emerged with my suitcase, she was reviewing footage. Going somewhere? She asked, barely looking up. Yes. She glanced at the suitcase, confused. What's going on? I showed her my phone, open to her TikTok, dating down Build's character. Her expression shifted from confusion to recognition to shame that it's just. It's content, babe. It's not serious. My followers eat that stuff up. It's just a persona I play online. The comments from your friends, those are persona, too. She became defensive. You're overreacting. Everyone exaggerates for social. It's not real life. It's real enough that you filmed me without my knowledge and mocked me to tens of thousands of people. I Picked up my suitcase. If I'm holding you back from whatever level you think you should be dating at, I'll remove myself from the equation. Don't be dramatic. It's just a stupid video. You're going to throw away our relationship over this? Our relationship ended the moment you decided I was content rather than a partner. I headed for the door. She called after me, her voice rising in panic as reality sank in. I didn't answer. Just got in my car and drove to a friend's place. That night, my phone blew up with messages from Mia. Defensive, angry, then careful. Apologies. I replied once. I deserve better than to be someone's stepping stone. Or social media punchline. Please don't contact me again. Then I blocked her number. Three days later, the artist whose breakup song I'd engineered posted a snippet on Instagram, tagging me. It caught attention in our local music.

So last month, I get this call from Mia's school asking me to come in because she was in trouble for breaking another kid's property. I'm thinking, what the hell? Because Mia is usually the kid who reminds the teacher when they forget to collect homework. I drop everything and drive over there, expecting maybe she accidentally knocked over someone's water bottle or something. I walk into the principal's office, and there's my daughter sitting in the chair with this huge grin on her face, like she just won the lottery. The principal, Mister Torres, starts going off about how she deliberately destroyed another girl's expensive necklace and how this behaviour is completely unacceptable and blah, blah, blah. Once he's done with his speech, I turn to Mia and ask her what actually happened. So here's the backstory. Last year, around Christmas time, Mia saved up all her allowance money for, like, three months to buy these matching best friend necklaces for her and this girl, Kaylee. They were these cute little heart ones that split in half with best on one side and friends on the other. I ordered them off some random website for 15 bucks, but to Mia, they might as well have been diamonds. Everything was great until this year, when their friendship went totally sideways. Turns out Kaylee was basically running this little extortion ring at school. She was threatening kids that if they didn't buy her stuff on Some mobile game. She'd spread rumors about them or make sure nobody would play with them at lunch. He was doing this to Mia, too, and when I found out, I told Mia to cut contact immediately. But here's where it gets really annoying. Even after Mia stopped hanging out with her, Kaylee kept demanding that Mia give her the other half of the friendship necklace so she could give it to someone else. Like, every single day, she'd walk up to Mia and be like, give me my necklace back. The fact that we bought both halves apparently didn't matter to this kid. My older nephew Tyler, heard about this drama and got really mad on Mia's behalf. He's 17 and super protective of his little cousins. The last weekend, when Mia was at my sister's house, Tyler and his twin brother Connor decided to help her with some therapeutic destruction. They got out hammers and pliers and went to town on that necklace charm until it was smashed into, like, eight tiny pieces. Mia thought this was the most hilarious thing ever and kept the broken pieces in her jewelry box. Well, apparently, Kaylee kept bugging her every day about the necklace, so finally, Mia had enough. She put all the broken pieces into a little plastic baggie and brought them to school during lunch. She walked right up to Kaylee's table, dumped out all the broken pieces in front of her, and said, here's your necklace back. You're gonna need some super glue and a lot of patience, because it's turned into a jigsaw puzzle. Kaylee completely lost it. Her face went bright red, and she started screaming and ran straight to the teacher, saying, Mia destroyed her property. Next thing I know, I'm getting called to come pick up my daughter from the principal's office. When Mister Torres finished his lecture,

Let's see if he can make it back. They laughed and drove away. I never came back. Standing at that Colorado gas station, watching their tail lights disappear, something inside me just broke. Five years of marriage, and Chloe thought abandoning me 300 miles from home was hilarious. No phone, no wallet, nothing. The gas station clerk, an older guy named Pete, saw me standing there looking lost. You all right, son? He asked. I explained what happened, expecting him to shake his head and walk away. Instead, he handed me a bottled water and said, some people ain't worth the ground they walk on. He even let me use his phone to call the local shelter. I hitched a ride to Grand Junction with a trucker who didn't ask questions, found a homeless shelter run by a former Marine named Roy. He handed me a clipboard and said, fill this out. Tomorrow we figure out the rest. That night, lying on a cot surrounded by strangers, I stared at the ceiling, thinking about Chloe's laugh as they drove away, how Stephanie had said, he'll figure it out. He always does. Like I was some kind of trained dog they could abandon for entertainment. Roy got me a job washing dishes at Jackie's for cash. The owner, a tough old woman covered in tattoos, paid me under the table. You running from something? She Asked one day, watching me scrub plates like my life depended on it. Running to something, I said. Turns out Jackie had connections. Real estate connections. She'd been flipping houses since the 90s. Knew every contractor, inspector and banker in town. You got a good head on your shoulders, she told me after I caught an accounting error that would have cost her thousands. Wanna learn the business? Six months later, I was swinging hammers and learning to read blueprints. Jackie taught me everything. How to spot a good deal, negotiate with contractors, manage cash flow. This ain't charity, she'd say. You're earning every dollar. Within two years, I owned three rental properties. Change my name legally to Marcus Stone. Felt right, felt solid. Found peace I'd never had with Chloe. No more walking on eggshells. No more being the butt of every joke at gatherings. I met Sarah at a hardware store. She was buying paint for her first apartment. Asked my advice on colors. We started dating. Slowly, carefully. When I told her my story, she just nodded and said, some chapters need to end before better ones can begin. We married three years later. Small ceremony. Just Jackie, Roy and a few close friends. Real friend. And who'd stick around when things got tough. Then last week, 15 years later, my phone started buzzing. Unknown No. 107 missed calls over two days. Finally answered. Mike? Oh, my God. Mike, is that you? I've been looking everywhere. Chloe's Voice desperate now crying. I hired a private investigator. It took months to find you. Mike, I'm so sorry. That day was the worst mistake of my life. My husband left me. I lost the house. The kids barely talk to me since the divorce. I have nothing left. Please, I need your help. I said quietly. You don't understand. I've been searching for you for years. I know you're successful now. I saw the business licenses, the properties. I know you can help me. We were married. That has to count for something. Chloe, I interrupted. You left me with nothing. Not even basic human decency. It was just a prank. The girls dared me. I never thought you'd actually stay gone. You never thought

You get nothing when we die. Then Grandma's lawyer called. She left me $2 million and a letter about their lies. I drove to their house with the biggest smile of my life. The call came Tuesday morning while I was eating cereal before my shift at Auto Zone. Unknown number. Almost didn't answer. Is this Marcus Chen? Yeah, that's me. This is Janet Walsh from Walsh and Associates. I'm calling about Eleanor Chen's estate. Your grandmother. My spoon dropped. Grandma, Eleanor died six months ago. My parents said I wasn't welcome at the funeral because I wasn't real family. There's been some mistake, I said. My parents told me she left everything to them and my brother. Silence then. Mister Chen, we need to meet today. Two hours later, I'm sitting in this fancy law office staring at documents that made zero sense. Grandma left me two. $2.1 million. Her house and investment accounts worth another $800,000. This can't be right, I stammered. I'm adopted. She wasn't really my grandmother. Janet handed me an envelope with my name and grandma's handwriting. Your grandmother insisted I give you this personally. She was very specific about the timing. I opened it with shaking hands. Marcus, you are not adopted. You're my biological grandson, son of my beloved daughter, Sarah. Sarah was David's first wife. She died in a car accident when you were 3 years old. David remarried Linda Six months later. Linda hated that you existed. You were proof of David's previous life. She wanted you gone. Wanted David to give you up for adoption so they could start fresh with their own children. I fought for you. I threatened to take them to court, expose what they were trying to do. They kept you, but Linda made your life hell as punishment. Every cruel word, every time they excluded you, every time they made you feel unwanted. That was Linda's doing. And David's cowardice in going along with it. I tried to maintain a relationship with you, but Linda made it impossible. She'd cancel visits, refuse to let you answer my calls. Eventually, they moved you all across states to keep you away from me. The last time I saw you, you were 15. I've missed six years because of their selfishness. I hired a private investigator to keep track of you. I know about the community college, the three jobs, the studio apartment you can barely afford. I know about the nights you ate nothing but ramen because you couldn't afford groceries. I know because I never stopped caring. I also know David and Linda have been telling everyone my estate will be equally among the grandchildren. They've been spending money they don't have, expecting a big inheritance. They're about to be very surprised. All my love, Grandma Eleanor. My hands were shaking as I finished reading. The truth hit me like a truck. I wasn't some unwanted adopted kid. I was her flesh. And blood cast aside by a stepmother who couldn't stand my existence. What do my parents think they're inheriting? I asked, and its smile was ice cold. Your grandmother LED them to believe they received the bulk of her estate. She encouraged this belief for years. Watching them dig themselves deeper into debt. How much have they spent? Based on our investigation, your father bought a 65 thousand dollar truck last year. Linda remodeled their entire kitchen for 50 thousand dollars. Your brother Logan got a 35 thousand dollar boat for graduation. They've taken out loans against the expected inheritance. Your parents currently owe $180,000 on credit and loans. I thought about my own life during that time. Working three jobs, eating ramen every night. Walking to work because my car died and I couldn't afford repairs. Asking for help with textbook money and being told I was too old for handouts. What are they actually getting? Janet consulted her papers. Logan and Ashley each receive $5,000. Your parents receive absolutely nothing. Your grandmother was very clear. David forfeited his right to inherit when he chose his new

Mom wanted me gone. Three weeks later, police were involved. My husband's ex shows up at pickup after being gone for eight years and announces, you're done playing Mommy. I'm back. She hasn't seen her son since he was 4. Just disappeared one day to find herself and left my husband with a confused child asking why Mommy doesn't call anymore. Adrian stands there looking at their shoes while their biological mother explains how a kid needs their real parent, not some replacement. My husband looks exhausted and says, maybe she has a point. They should bond. He works 70 hours a week running his construction company. Which is why I know this is going to be a disaster, because I handle everything. But, sure, let them bond. I'm their mother. You just married their dad. She keeps emphasizing mother, like I don't know how biology works. Like I haven't been doing pick up and drop off and doctor's appointments and parent teacher conferences for two years, all while she was finding herself in Arizona with some guy named Carl. Well, I'm here now. My child doesn't need you. Fine. I pack up Adrian's special foods from my car, the ones for their specific texture issues, delete the 17 reminders for their schedule from my phone, hand her the inhaler I always carry. Adrian forgets theirs. She looks at it confused. He has asthma? She doesn't know her kid has asthma. Okay, I tell her, you're the real parent. I'll step back completely. She actually looks pleased with herself, but she has no idea what she's walking into. Day one Adrian shows up to school without their presentation that counts for 30% of their grade. X says kids need to learn responsibility. She doesn't know Adrian has executive dysfunction and needs three alarms plus the checklist. Day 2 Adrian eats cheese at lunch and throws up everywhere because X packed them a grilled cheese. Adrian texted me saying she asked since when are you lactose intolerant? Since always. I answered back for her. She'd know if she'd been here. Day 4 the teacher calls because Adrian punched the quiet kid. X leaves Adrian when they say the kid deserved it for looking at them weird. I know the quiet kid is Adrian's only friend and they play fight as their weird inside joke, but I'm not the real parent so I say nothing. Now Adrian has lunch detention and no friends. Week 2 Adrian starts failing his tests. X doesn't know he needs to walk around while memorizing or their brain literally won't retain information. She tells him to try harder. Adrian gains 10 pounds in two weeks because X doesn't recognize their stress eating patterns. When Adrian's anxious, they'll eat an entire box of crackers without realizing. X just keeps buying more crackers. They're wearing the same hoodie every day and it smells like death. It's their favorite. She doesn't know it's their anxiety hoodie and wearing it Constantly means they're spiraling. Week three, the principal calls about concerning behavior. Adrian told the counselor they don't care about anything anymore. They're just being dramatic teens. You know, Adrian's best friend's mom calls me secretly because she still has my number. Your Adrian asked my kid for their adderall. I thought you should know. X doesn't even know Adrian needs an ADHD evaluation. Doesn't know they can't focus without their specific routine. Then I see the scratches on Adrian's arms when I run into them at the store. Deep parallel lines. X says it's mosquito bites. In December? In Michigan? Friday afternoon, I'm at work when my husband calls, and his voice is shaking. Something's wrong. His ex lost their kid at the mall three hours ago. He said he was going to the bathroom. That was at noon. It's now three. Troll car finds him at the bus station with a backpack full of clothes and $300 cash. When we pick him up from the police station, we ask, where did you get the money? Adrian says they've been selling their Ritalin. You don't take Ritalin? The ex says, as far as you know.

It's just temporary, mom said, cutting her steak like we were discussing weekend plans, until David gets comfortable with kids being around. So let me get this straight. Jennifer wants to hide her three children from her new boyfriend, dump them with me for months, and I'm supposed to pay for daycare while she plays house? You don't understand what sacrifice means. Dad jumped in, waving his fork dramatically. Jennifer's given up everything for those kids. The audacity was absolutely unreal. Jennifer had been pawning her kids off on everyone for years. Last month she dropped them at our cousin's wedding reception and disappeared for the entire party. The month before that, she left them with our 80 year old neighbor, Missus Chen, while she went clubbing until 3 a m. Two months ago, she dumped them on me for a girls weekend that turned into 5 days. I nodded and kept eating my ribs and calm. Sounds like you've got it all figured out. The thing is, Jennifer finally looked up from her phone, eyes sparkling with greed. David's got serious money. Like country club money. I Already told him I don't have kids yet. Just need a few months to ease him into the idea of family life. And you'll somehow manage Emma, Jake, and Sophie during the day while you're working full time? Mom asked me to. Exactly. Like I wasn't even there to speak for myself. Oh, I figured Laura could find a babysitter. Jennifer shrugged casually. I'll be pretty tight on cash with David moving in. His place is expensive to maintain, so I'd be paying for full time childcare for kids that aren't mine. While she pretends to be child free to trap some wealthy guy. The plan was absolutely insane, even for Jennifer. But here's the thing. I'd overheard this entire manipulative scheme two weeks go from Jennifer's friend Sarah at the grocery store. Sarah felt guilty about the plan and spilled every detail. Jennifer had been orchestrating this deception for months, already telling Dave. But she was single with no kids, so I'd already moved out of my apartment and across town. I spent two weeks quietly packing during lunch breaks, found a perfect place near the river, transferred my lease, changed my address with work, updated my voter registration, forwarded my mail, the whole nine yards. My parents and Jennifer had absolutely no idea. Great, I said, standing up and wiping barbecue sauce from my hands. You can drop them off at my place tomorrow morning around 9. I'll be completely ready. Jennifer's face lit up like Christmas morning. Really? Oh, my god. Thank you so much. I knew you'd come through for family. Mom started tearing up. You're such a good sister, Laura. I gave them my old address with a straight face. You? No, the completely empty apartment I'd already vacated. The one with the bright for rent sign posted in the front window. That night, I turned off my phone completely and enjoyed my first peaceful evening in my beautiful new place. I ordered pizza, unpacked my last moving box, and watch Netflix without any guilt or interruptions. The next morning, Jennifer showed up at my old apartment complex with three enormous duffel bags. Car seats, toys, snack.

My mother ambushed me during a board meeting. If you don't bring someone to our anniversary gala, I'm calling Missus Mendez about her daughter. She's very interested in meeting you. Well, board members suddenly found their phones fascinating while their 35 year old CEO got threatened with an arranged marriage. After dismissing everyone, I walked past the break room and heard muffled crying from the bathroom. Through the door, I could make out Selena's voice. I understand, mom. I'll figure out the payment somehow. Just tell them we need two more weeks. Selena emerged with red eyes. She tried to hide behind her glasses. She'd been my assistant for two. Two years. Never late, never complaining, always staying past eight without being asked. Everything alright, I asked, though we both knew I'd heard. She straightened her blazer and forced her professional smile. Of course, Mister Pierce, did you need the quarterly reports? That's when I had the idea. Actually, I have a proposition, I said. Watching her reaction, $50,000 for three months of work, evenings and weekends. Her eyes widened, but she stayed composed. What kind of work? Being my girlfriend, fake girlfriend. I clarified contract basis, strict boundaries. We attend events together, hold hands in public, convince my parents I'm in a relationship. Three months until their anniversary passes. She stared at me for a full minute. You're serious? Completely. You need money for your Mother's medical bills. I need my parents off my back. Simple transaction. Within a week we had a 12 page contract. No feelings, no private touching, three dates weekly, public affection only when necessary. She slid the papers across. I added a termination clause. Either party can exit with 24 hours notice. I nodded. Remember, we've been dating three months. You call me sweetheart sometimes. We met when I started working here but kept it professional until recently. Her voice was clinical like reading a spreadsheet. First month was flawless. Selena transformed into the perfect girlfriend at charity galas and family dinners. Ready, darling, she'd say with a bright smile that never quite reached her eyes. She researched my colleagues wives, laughed at my father's golf stories, charmed my mother completely. In private, we maintained exact professional distance. She'd brief me like we were preparing for a merger. I should touch your shoulder when you mention the Tokyo deal, she'd say. Reviewing notes show support. We memorize things about each other. Your favorite color is blue. You're allergic to shellfish. We met at a charity auction. Two months. We were like the world's most professional actors. We had eight weeks left. Everything was perfectly on track. Then came the storm. Thunder crashed through my penthouse at midnight. Rain hammering the windows. The sound mixed with rumbling. And suddenly I was 15 again, trapped in our car as it hydroplane. My brother screaming, metal crunching, then silence. The panic attack hit Like a freight train, my chest locked, vision tunneling, legs buckling, I collapsed beside my bed, gasping for air that wouldn't come through the roaring in my ears. I heard my door opening. Selena's voice called out, Mister Pierce, you left these contracts. I thought you'd need them for tomorrow. She found me on the floor, shaking, drenched in sweat. Without hesitation, she dropped everything and knelt beside me. Look at me breathe.

Oh, right, you don't have any. My parents laughed, so I said, where's your money? Oh, right. I've been supporting you until today. For seven years, I've been the unofficial safety net for my entire family. When my younger brother Jason couldn't make rent, I covered it. When mom's car broke down, I paid for repairs. When dad's consulting business had slow months, I slipped him money. I never complained. I told myself it was what a good son should do. And till that Sunday afternoon when everything changed. We were all in my parents living room, half watching football, when Jason turned to me with this smug grin and said, so, Brian, where's your wife and kids? Oh, right, you don't have any. Mom actually laughed, had chuckled. Jason leaned back like he delivered the punch line of the century. I sat there stunned. Jason's always been the golden boy. Younger, more charismatic. The one who turns every bad decision into a charming anecdote. But something about that moment, with everyone laughing at me while I bankrolled their lives, hit differently. When the laughter died down, I looked at Jason and said, where's your money? I've been supporting you until today. The room went dead silent. Jason's grin faltered. For the first time ever, I'd spoken to them with finality. Jason recovered quickly. Wow. Touchy much? It was just a joke, Brian. Dad shifted in his chair. You can't expect Tim, to be as responsible as you. Jason's young. He's just having fun. That line was gasoline on fire. I'd heard it my whole life. Jason wasn't held to the same standards. J didn't have to get straight A's or pay rent when he moved back home after dropping out. Jason just had to show up and smile. I didn't argue. I just stood up, grabbed my jacket, and left. That night, I reviewed bank statements. Nearly $86,000 had gone to my family over seven years. I'd made it way too easy for them. The next week, dad called. The mortgage is due, and you haven't sent anything this month. I'm not doing that anymore. I said. You can't just stop. We rely on that money. That's the problem. He hung up on me. At Sunday dinner, mom said, we can't keep going like this. Your father and I have bills. Jason has student loans. Jason dropped out of college. I pointed out you make enough to help. She continued. That was before I realized I'm the only one here trying to be an adult. Jason looked up, smirking. So now you're better than us because you have money? No, I'm better than you because I work for it while you burn through my paycheck. Jason rolled his eyes. Whatever. You're still single. Can't be that great of a life. That's when something inside me went ice cold. I put my fork down and said, I'm not paying for anything. Else? Not the mortgage, not Jason's rent, nothing. If you lose the house, that's on you. Dad slammed his hand on the table. I walked out. The calls started immediately. Voicemails about how I was tearing the family apart. But I felt no guilt. Three weeks later, they showed up at my apartment. We went to the bank, dad said, pulling out a folder.

I need an alpha. I replied, I understand. Jessica sat me down in our living room last Tuesday with this rehearsed speech about how she needed someone who takes charge, a real leader. Then came the kicker. She'd been getting close to my coworker, Mark from marketing. He's everything you're not, Michael, she said, her voice dripping with condescension. Confident, ambitious, going places. You're just comfortable being mediocre. I sat there quietly while she explained how Mark was about to get promoted to regional director, the position that would make him everyone's boss, including mine. She'd even been feeding him insider information from her role in HR to help his application look stronger. Once Mark gets that promotion, we'll be the power couple of the office, she grinned, practically glowing with excitement.

She went on about how Mark commanded every room he entered, how he closed deals with a handshake, how he had that killer her instinct that I apparently lacked. She said watching him work made her realize what she'd been settling for all these years. You're a great guy, Michael, but you're just not leadership material. You'll always be support staff, she said, patting my shoulder like I was a child. Mark sees the big picture. He takes risks. He makes things happen. The insult stung. Because it was so calculated. She'd clearly been thinking about this for months, comparing us, weighing our worth like commodities. In her mind, she was trading up. I need someone who fights for what they want, she continued. Someone who doesn't just accept things as they are. Mark would never just sit there quietly like you're doing right now. I simply said, I understand and went to bed. Here's what she didn't know. Three weeks ago, corporate had secretly offered me that same regional director position. They said Mark looked impressive in meetings, but consistently made promises the technical team couldn't deliver. His strategy sounded great, but ignored crucial operational realities. We need someone who understands both sides, the VP had told me during our confidential meeting. Someone who can actually execute, not just sell dreams. Mark's proposals look flashy, but half of them would bankrupt us if we tried to implement them. The VP explained that while Mark was great at client presentations, he caused three major project delays in the past year by over promising capability. What is we didn't have. Meanwhile, my quiet efficiency had been saving the company millions by designing systems that actually worked. I've been hesitant to accept because I genuinely enjoyed my current role as senior systems architect. I like solving complex problems, building things that work. Management politics wasn't appealing. But after Jessica's speech about needing an alpha and her casual dismissal of my capabilities, my hesitation completely disappeared. Her betrayal had Clarified everything. Monday morning, I walked into the VP's office and accept to the position. Outstanding choice, Michael, he said, shaking my hand firmly. We'll announce it Wednesday. I have to say, we were hoping you'd come around. The board was unanimous. You're exactly what this company needs. At Tuesday, Mark was already celebrating. Prematurely. I heard him on a call with a client making promises about timeline and capabilities that were completely unrealistic. He'd even ordered business cards with regional director printed on them. Jessica texted me from HR saying she was so excited for the big announcement tomorrow and that she'd already made dinner reservation.

My two best friends, Mia and Jade, had this belief that every boyfriend needed to be tested. They done it with every guy in our friend group. Hidden cameras, fake emergencies, planted temptations, always claiming it was saving us from heartbreak. When Mia discovered my boyfriend Ryan had been jewelry shopping, they told me they wanted to run the test on him. Three years means nothing if he can't pass a simple loyalty test, Ade insisted. Better to know now than after. You're engaged. We're trying to protect you. I protested that Ryan was different, that I trusted him completely. But they wore me down with stories of friends who'd been blindsided, marriages that crumbled, women who wished they'd known sooner. If he passes, you'll never doubt him again. Mia promised. One hour of discomfort for a lifetime of certainty. Against every instinct screaming no, I agreed. The plan was simple. I'd text Ryan about a fake emergency at Mia's apartment, then hide in the bedroom with my laptop while Mia answered the door. Jade had set up her phone as a hidden camera in the living room, barely visible unless you knew where to look. My hands shook with hesitation and fear as I texted Ryan, I'm at Mia's having a panic attack. Please come quickly. Ryan replied instantly, I'll be there in 10 minutes. Those 10 minutes felt like hours as I sat on Mia's bed with my laptop. Open. Watching the empty living room through Jade's camera feed. When the doorbell rang, my heart hammered so hard I thought I might actually have a panic attack. Mia answered the door, wearing a silk robe. Ryan, your girlfriend just stepped out to get air. Come in. Let's wait for her. On screen, I watched Ryan's confused face and concerned glances around the apartment. Mia guided him to the couch, sitting unnecessarily close. She's been so stressed lately, Mia heard, placing her hand on his arm. Ryan shifted away, clearly uncomfortable. Maybe I should call her, he said, reaching for his phone. Mia's hand moved to his chest. She'll be back soon. Relax. Fingers traced patterns on his shirt. You know, I've always thought you were incredibly attractive. Ryan froze. Mia, what are you doing? She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a whisper I could barely hear through the camera. She doesn't have to know. We can keep this between us. I know you want this, too. Ryan's whole body tensed as she pressed against him, trying to push him back into the couch cushions. Stomach turned watching his obvious discomfort, the way his hands stayed firmly at his sides, his body angled away from her. Suddenly, Ryan pushed Mia away and stood up, his face flushed with anger. What the hell is wrong with you? His eyes swept the room and for a moment seemed to lock directly on the camera. Something flickered across his face. Realization, maybe? Before he headed for the door, Mia grabbed his arm. Wait, Ryan, I can explain. But he yanked free and was gone, the door slamming behind him. I heard his car tear out of the parking lot. The next morning, after a sleepless night, I drove to his house, desperate to explain. He opened the door, but blocked my entry with a cold expression. I need to tell you something I started about last night. The test, he interrupted. I know. I saw the camera. I saw it watching me while your friend threw herself at me. I noticed his eyes were squinting and realized that he was both angry and disappointed. Ryan, I'm so sorry. They convinced

Someone who doesn't just accept things as they are. Mark would never just sit there quietly like you're doing right now. I simply said, I understand and went to bed. Here's what she didn't know. Three weeks ago, corporate had secretly offered me that same regional director position. They said Mark looked impressive in meetings, but consistently made promises the technical team and couldn't deliver. His strategy sounded great, but ignored crucial operational realities. We need someone who understands both sides, the VP had told me during our confidential meeting. Someone who can actually execute, not just sell dreams. Mark's proposals look flashy, but half of them would bankrupt us if we tried to implement them. The VP explained that while Mark was great at client presentations, he caused three major project delays in the past year by over promising capability abilities we didn't have. Meanwhile, my quiet efficiency had been saving the company millions by designing systems that actually worked. I've been hesitant to accept because I genuinely enjoyed my current role as senior systems architect. I like solving complex problems, building things that work. Management politics wasn't appealing. But after Jessica's speech about needing an alpha and her casual dismissal of my capabilities, my hesitation completely disappeared. Her betrayal had Clarified everything. Monday morning, I walked into the VP's office and accepted the position. Outstanding choice, Michael, he said, shaking my hand firmly. We'll announce it Wednesday. I have to say, we were hoping you'd come around. The board was unanimous. You're exactly what this company needs. At Tuesday, Mark was already celebrating prematurely. I heard him on a call with a client making promises about timeline and capabilities that were completely unrealistic. He'd even ordered business cards with regional director printed on them. Jessica texted me from HR saying she was so excited for the big announcement tomorrow and that she'd already made dinner reservations to celebrate Mark's promotion. She seemed to think I'd be happy for them. Wednesday at 2 p m, the company wide email went out introducing me as the new regional director, effective immediately. My first directive was restructuring the marketing promises to align with actual technical capabilities, essentially undoing everything Mark had been promising clients. Mark got his rejection email

Changed everything about that Cabo trip. I texted our family group chat emergency app endoscopy tomorrow. Need someone to pick up Max from daycare. My sister Amber replied, lol can't. We're literally boarding for Cabo right now. Mom added, ask your neighbor. This trip cost us $3,000. I simply wrote, got it. My four year old son, Max had been asking all week why Aunt Lily and grandma couldn't help when daddy was sick. I told him they were on an important trip. He nodded seriously and said, more important than you getting better. The drive to the hospital at 5 a m. Was terrifying. Max's overnight bag was packed with his stuffed elephant and three days worth of clothes. Missus Chen, my 74 year old neighbor, met us at her door in her bathrobe. She spoke broken English but hugged Max like he was her own grandson. Don't worry, she whispered to me. I take good care. What was supposed to be a routine appendectomy turned into a nightmare. Internal bleeding kept me unconscious for eighteen hours. When I woke up, machines were beeping and tubes were everywhere. The surgeon explained I'd need to stay at least six days for monitoring. My phone had dozens of missed calls, but none from family. Instead, there were voicemails from Mrs. Chen in her careful English. Max eating good breakfast. He helped me water plants. He very good boy. Day three I was finally stable enough to Facetime Max, sitting at Mrs. Chen's kitchen table, carefully folding dumplings with tiny fingers covered in flour. Daddy! Mrs. Chen teaching me to make food. She says I'm very smart. He held up a lopsided dumpling proudly. In the background, Mrs. Chen beamed and gave me a thumbs up. That same day, my phone rang. Hospital administration. Mr. Rodriguez, your mother called demanding to speak with your doctor about visiting hours. She was quite insistent about getting details regarding your condition. When we explained you've been here since Monday with complications from emergency surgery, she became extremely upset. I was confused. She called you? Yes. She seems surprised you were here at all. She mentioned something about thinking you were being dramatic about a simple teacher. Thirty minutes later, my phone exploded. Mom? Daniel, why didn't you tell us you were dying? Amber? OMG, I'm literally shaking RN. I had no idea it was serious. Mom, again? We're booking flights home right now. This is insane. I was too weak to respond immediately, but I managed to piece together what happened through a friend who'd seen Amber's Instagram stories. She'd been posting beach content all week, including a story yesterday of Max eating breakfast at some random Asian lady's house with I'm laughing emojis. The caption read, my brother's parenting choices are wild. Like, why is my nephew at a stranger's house? Elmo, A family friend, Mrs. Rodriguez from church, had in the story, And called mom in a panic. Why is little Max staying with strangers? Where's Daniel? Is everything okay? Mom had apparently brushed it off, saying I was being dramatic about a minor surgery, and that I was probably partying or dating someone new while Max stayed elsewhere. But Mrs. Rodriguez kept pressing. It's been four days, Maria. A four year old shouldn't be away from his father that long. Unless something's really wrong.

Marriage is a complete nightmare, bro. I wake up every day regretting my decision. If it wasn't for her family's money, I'd be gone already. I froze on the stairs. We just celebrated our three year anniversary last week. He'd cried reading his vows tell. Telling me I was the best thing that ever happened to him. The vow renewal thing, pure torture, man. Had to stand there making up romantic bullshit while her family looked on all mystied. I've gotten good at the performance, though. Oscar worthy. He actually laughed. My heart shattered into a million pieces. But hey, small price to pay for the lifestyle, right? Her dad's talking about bringing me into the family business next year. Once I'm established there, I'll have options. More options than just being the money wife's husband. The money wife. That's what he calls me behind my back. I quietly left and returned at my normal time, greeting him with a kiss like nothing happened. The taste of betrayal was bitter on my lips. Five days I've been living this nightmare. Sleeping next to someone who calls our marriage a complete disaster behind my back. Every morning I wake up wondering how I missed all the signs. But I haven't been sitting around crying. I've been busy. Moving money from our joint accounts into my personal one. Changing passwords on everything, getting my Financial ducks in a row. I discovered he's been making weird withdrawals for months. 200 here, 300 there. Always just under the amount we agreed needed discussion. Where was that money going? Another woman. Savings for his eventual escape. Yesterday, I casually mentioned my dad might be scaling back his business due to health concerns. Complete lie. But Connor's face went white as a sheet. Suddenly he was asking all these detailed questions about Dad's retirement plans and our future security. Not once did he ask about Dad's supposed health issues. I've been making subtle changes, too. Taking more private calls, working late, seeing just a little less affect. Mentioning casual conversations with our family lawyer. And Connor is absolutely losing it. Two nights ago, I caught him going through my closet while I was in the shower. Yesterday, he was scrolling through my search history on the iPad. Deliberately left searches for signs your husband is cheating and separate bank accounts for him to find. The psychological warfare is working. He's been frantically fixing things around the house that he's ignored for months. The squeaky bathroom door, the wobbly kitchen table, the broken porch light. It's like watching someone desperately trying to prove their value. Last night, he suggested we renew our vows again for the second time in three weeks. The desperation in his eyes was almost pathetic. When I asked why the sudden interest, he stammered something about celebrating our love with everyone important to us. Translation He's panicking about his gravy train derailing and wants to

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently. And just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key, re rebuilding with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's Pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never I've seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving. Night. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me He picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear. From rage.

His parents showed up at our door in March without even asking. His mom literally called and told me they were coming to wait out quarantine at our place, like not asked, told me. And I already knew this was gonna suck because they've always treated me like garbage. They make these snide comments about everything I do, act like they own the place and basically think I'm not good enough for their precious son. Right from day 1, they started running our apartment like it was theirs. They tell me what to cook, when to clean, how loud my music could be. But the worst part was the stupid air conditioning fight that went on for weeks. It's been like 85 degrees every single day here and I keep the AC at 70 because that's comfortable. But nope, they started whining about being cold, so I compromised and put it at 75. I'm already sweating my butt off, but whatever. I'm trying to keep the peace. That wasn't good enough, though. They wanted the heat on in 90 degree weather. The heat, I'd wake up in the middle of the night literally drenched in sweat because they'd sneak over and crank the thermostat up to like 80 degrees. I told them to stop messing with it probably 20 times, but they kept doing it anyway. So yesterday morning before work, I grabbed a Roll of duct tape and put like 10 pieces over the thermostat. I even wrote a note that said do not touch the thermostat while I am at work, in big letters. Pretty clear, right? I get home at six PM and it hits me like a wall of heat. The second I open the door. It's hotter inside than it is outside, which shouldn't even be possible. The duct tape is ripped off. My note is crumpled up on the floor and they've got the heat cranked to 98 freaking degrees, 98. I checked the thermostat three times because I couldn't believe it. I marched straight to the guest room where they're just chilling like nothing happened. His mom is sitting there filing her nails and his dad is watching some cooking show. I'm like dripping sweat already. And I go, why could you not follow the simple instruction of do not touch the thermostat? This is my home. I'm tired of you saying rude things to me. I'm tired of you treating me like a child and making your own rules for my apartment. You either need to respect me and my boundaries or go back to your own house. His mom doesn't even look up from her nails at first. Then she gets this nasty look on her face and says, you have no right to barge in here without knocking. That was not only an invasion of privacy, but you need to take the attitude out. Of your tone, dealt with much bigger bitches than you before. That's when I completely lost it. She called me a bitch in my own apartment after I let them stay here for free, after I've been bending over backwards trying to make them comfortable, after they've been treating me like dirt for months. She kept going on and on for like 30 minutes about how disrespectful I am and how I need to learn my place and all this other garbage. I just stood there like.

She took my kids, and I lost my job. I spent years rebuilding my life. And when she found out I became rich, she tried to sue me for alimony. So I turned the tables in the most unexpected way. Three years after my divorce, I was barely scraping by as a freelance graphic designer, living in a studio apartment, eating ramen. Whole divorced dad starter pack. My ex wife, Laura, had convinced everyone I was having an affair with my work partner, Michelle. She'd moved in with her trainer, Kevin, the day our divorce was finalized. Then my weird uncle Robert died. The guy everyone called crazy because he collected vintage comic books and live like a hermit. Family reunions were awkward because Robert would corner people and lecture them about Superman No. 1 being better than gold. Turns out Uncle Robert wasn't so crazy. His comic collection was worth eight. Two million dollars. A mint condition Superman number one worth 3.2 million alone. I inherited everything. The local newspaper ran the story. By noon, my phone was buzzing like crazy. Within 48 hours, guess who called. Laura, who hadn't spoken to me in six months except through lawyers. Hey, stranger! She purred, using that voice she used to get expensive dinners. I heard about your uncle. I'm so sorry for your loss. Two years ago, she called him that smelly comic book. Weird. The kids have been asking about you. She continued, maybe we could meet for coffee, discuss their future now that your situation has changed. Translation I smell money and want my cut. I agreed to meet at Brewster's, where we had our first date. She showed up in a brand new BMW X5 designer handbag, fresh manicure clothes that cost more than my monthly rent. Interesting upgrade for someone claiming financial struggles. You look good, she said. With that fake success suits you. We ordered coffee. She got some twelve dollar specialty drink. I got black coffee. The twins really miss you, she started. Rachel keeps asking why daddy doesn't take them on vacation. And Daniel wants little league, but you. You know how expensive that is. Classic Laura manipulation. Making me feel guilty about money. With your new situation, she continued, maybe we could work out better custody. The kids deserve to benefit from their father's good fortune. Then came her real play. Actually, I've been thinking about our divorce timeline. Some of those comics probably appreciated during our marriage. My lawyer thinks I might have a claim to a portion of the inheritance. I nearly choked. We've been divorced for two years. Robert died three days ago. Laura, we've been divorced since 2021. Robert died Monday. She waved dismissively. But the collection existed during our marriage. Community property laws are complex. Her attorney. Of course, she'd already consulted someone. You know what I said, reaching into my jacket, Uncle Robert actually left something for you. Too. Her eyes lit up like a Jackpot. She probably expected a valuable comic or check. I handed her an envelope with her name and Robert's handwriting. She tore it open eagerly. I watched her face change as she read. Confusion, shock. Pure panic. The letter was a masterpiece. Robert had documented everything. Photos of Laura with Kevin six months before she filed for divorce. Screenshots where she bragged about taking me to the cleaners. Bank records of her secret account. A timeline of her lies about my supposed affair. The final paragraph was perfect.

The backyard went silent. My wife Mara's face went white. What did you just say? I asked, but I already knew. Will laughed. Come on, Jackson. 18 years of playing house. Emily's mine. I felt my knees buckle. Emily was staring between us, confused. Dad, what's he talking about? Mara was shaking her head frantically. Will, stop! You're drunk.

All built on a lie. You're lying! Emily screamed at will, but her voice cracked like she wasn't sure. My brother. My own brother shrugged. Sorry, man. Had to come out sometime. I looked at my wife, the woman I'd loved for 20 years. Is it true she couldn't meet my eyes? That was answer enough. Emily ran inside, crying. Half the party followed her. The other half just stare. Stared at me like I was some tragic zoo animal. Will walked over and patted my shoulder. No hard feelings, right? I've never hit anyone in my life, but hearing the crack of his nose breaking felt better than Any therapy ever could. Will hit the ground hard. My mom screamed. But I wasn't done. 20 years of marriage, 18 years of fatherhood, all stolen from me. You wanna know what's really funny? I said, standing over him. I've been paying for Emily's college fund, her car, everything. Will was holding his nose. Jackson, please. I've been the uncle. I continue. You've been playing dad with my money. That's when Mara finally spoke. It wasn't supposed to happen like this. I turned to her. When did it start? Right after Emily was born. She whispered. You were working so much. Will was always around, helping himself to my wife. Emily came back outside, tears streaming. Dad, please tell me this isn't real. The word dad hit different now. Like a knife twisting. I don't know what I am anymore. Sweetheart. Will struggled to his feet. And work this out. Split custody or something. Custody? I laughed. You think I'm sharing anything else with you? My sister grabbed my arm. Jackson, calm down. Calm down. My brother just announced he's been sleeping with my wife for 18 years. At my retirement party, dad was sitting in his lawn chair, looking like he'd aged 10 years. Mom was crying into her potato salad. Will wiped his face. We never meant for it to go this long. 18 years, will. 18 years. Emily looked between us for the first time. I saw it. The nose, the eyes. How had I Been so blind. Am I really not your daughter? She asked me. My heart shattered. You'll always be my daughter, M. Biology doesn't change that. But even as I said it, I knew everything had changed forever. Will started walking toward his car. I'll give you space to process this face. I followed him. You're not going anywhere. I grabbed his keys. You created this mess. You're going to face it. Maura finally found her voice. Jackson let him go. Oh, so now you're protecting him in front of everyone? The entire party was watching our family implode in real time. Aunts, uncles, cousins. All witnesses to the destruction. Will turned back. What do you want from me? I want my life back. I said I want my daughter back. I want 18 years back. I

So I said, perfect! And treated her exactly like I treat my other friends, with boundaries. When Sophia hit me with the friend speech on a random Thursday night, I agreed so fast her head nearly spun off. Wait, you're not going to fight for us? Beg me to reconsider. Nope. Friends sounds great. And the confusion on her face was priceless. See, what Sophia didn't know was that I've been playing to break up with her for three weeks. She was suffocating me, going through my phone, interrogating me about every female coworker, throwing tantrums when I hung out with my buddies. But she beat me to the punch, so I just smiled and played along. I think she expected me to be devastated, maybe cry a little. Definitely gravel. Instead, I helped her pack her stuff and even called her an Uber. The look of pure bewilderment as I waved goodbye was worth every penny. The next morning, reality started hitting. She texted at 7:00am asking if I wanted to grab our usual Saturday. Hey, brunch? I said I was busy with my friend Luca. Since when do you prioritize Luca over me? Since we became friends, and Luca and I have standing Saturday plans. Now, this was complete news to Luca, but when I called him, laughing about the situation, he was totally down to be my alibi. We actually did start hanging out more. Turns out I've been neglecting my friendships while walking on eggshells. By week two, Sophia was panicking. I wasn't responding to her texts immediately anymore. When she'd send paragraphs about her day, I'd reply with cool or a thumbs up emoji. You know, like I do with my actual friends. Why are you being so cold? I'm not being cold. This is how I text my friends. But I'm not just any friend. According to you last week, that's exactly what you are. The desperation started showing when she began manufacturing crisis. Her car broke down near my apartment three times in one week. Each time, I'd send her always number and tell her I was busy. Before, I would have dropped everything to rescue her. Now she was just another friend with car trouble. Week three brought the waterworks. She showed up at my door at ten PM crying about work stress. Old me would have canceled my plans, made tea, and listened for hours. New me said, that sucks. And have you talked to your sister about it? I'm heading out to meet some people. What people? Since when do you have Thursday night plans? Just some friends from the gym. Rachel's having people over. The name Rachel hit her like a slap. She knew I've been going to a new gym since we became friends, but hearing about another woman sent her into overdrive. Rachel? Who's Rachel? A friend. You know, like we are. I grabbed my jacket and Headed for the door. Lock up when you leave. And maybe call ahead next time. Friends usually don't just show up unannounced. Nuclear meltdown happened at Chris's birthday party two weeks later. I showed up solo. Sophia arrived with some guy named Walter, clearly trying to make me jealous. I shook Walter's hand, welcomed him to the group, then proceeded to have an amazing time without giving Sophia a second thought. Halfway through the night, she cornered me in Chris's kitchen, looking frantic. Why aren't you jealous? Why don't you care that I'm here with someone else? Why would I be jealous? Friends date people. I'm happy you're putting yourself out there, but we have history. We live together. We talked about marriage. Yeah, yeah, and then you said you wanted to be friends, so now we're friends. That's what you wanted, right? She tried to grab my hands. I stepped back politely but firmly. Sophia, friends don't do that. Her face went nuclear red. You're being cruel. This isn't what I meant. What did you mean, then? She couldn't answer because we both knew she'd wanted to keep me as her emotional support system while exploring other options. The classic cake and eat it too situation. I made a mistake, she whispered. I want you back. Sorry, M. I'm actually seeing someone.

The window frame creaked as I pulled myself through, thinking I'd successfully snuck back from Carter's party at 2 a m. But the second my feet hit the bedroom floor, the lamp clicked on, and there sat my dad in my desk chair, my laptop open in front of him, displaying every single text between me and Carter from the past three months. I knew I was dead. Fun night, he said, pulling up the pictures I sent him. I was so embarrassed as he started lecturing me on getting pregnant. You did this to yourself. Ali is going back to the shelter tomorrow morning. My heart fell through the floor as I processed what he was saying. Ali, the golden retriever puppy I'd gotten for my 16th birthday just two weeks ago. The dog I've been begging for since I was 7. The only thing that made being trapped in this house bearable. You can't do that! He's mine! You gave him to me! I sobbed, but my dad was already walking toward the door. The next morning, I watched through tear blurred eyes as dad loaded Ollie into the car, the puppies confused, whimpering, breaking what was left of my heart. And I spent the entire day in my room, refusing to eat, refusing to talk to them, just staring at Ali's empty bed in the corner and the toy rope he'd left behind. By 11 p m, when I heard my parents go to bed, their bedroom door clicking shut with finality. I knew what I had to do. I was getting my effing dog back this time. I didn't even bother being quiet as I went out the front door, not carrying if they heard me, not caring about consequences anymore. The animal shelter was only a mile away, and when I got there, I marched straight to the desk with tears streaming down my face. I sobbed out a story about how my parents had accidentally brought in my emotional support animal, how I had severe anxiety and needed him back immediately, how it was all a terrible misunderstanding. Please, I begged. He's microchipped under my name. I can prove he's mine. This is all just a huge mistake. My parents didn't realize what they were doing. After what felt like an eternity of back and forth of me showing every photo and video I had of tears and pleading, she finally relented, saying she could make an exception given the circumstances. I was walking out with Ali bouncing happily beside me, his tail wagging frantically, when I heard someone shout, wait! Stop! You can't take that dog! But I didn't look back, just started running, with Ali keeping pace, both of us sprinting through the parking lot and into the darkness of the suburban streets. My phone stayed silent as I jogged home. No calls from the shelter, no texts from my parents, nothing. They Must not have noticed I was gone yet. Probably assumed I was sulking in my room like I've been doing all day. But when I rounded the corner to our street, I saw the weirdest thing. Our front door was wide open, every light in the house blazing. And that definitely wasn't normal for midnight. I thought my parents were out looking for me. And as I crept closer, Ali suddenly tense beside me. Through the doorway, I could see chaos.

My friend Holly and I were voted couple most likely to get married in the yearbook, even though we told everyone we would never date. But I get why. She was a beautiful homecoming queen and I was football captain. The usual cliche, except, you know, we weren't jerks to everyone like in those movies. So, yeah, the pressure was ridiculous. Every school event, every party, even parent teacher conferences, someone would pull me or Holly aside and ask when we were finally going to date. Our homeroom teacher literally started a betting pool. The only person who listened was my best friend Kira, who told us, you guys don't have to date just because everyone else wants you to. But I didn't realize she had told us that for a really good reason. Something I found out way later. When Justin Bieber said, never say never, he was right. Because at our classmates pool party, it finally happened. Holly and I were sitting by the fire pit, everyone chanting kiss, kiss, kiss like we were in middle school. She looked at me, rolled her eyes, and said, let's just get this over with. When we kissed, everyone literally cheered. To me, it felt like nothing. Not bad, not good. Just literally pressing your face to another human being. But since everyone was so happy about it, we started dating and everything. Went smoothly, right? Not exactly. But it did lead to something so much better. To be fair, our dates weren't that bad. Our first official date was that weekend. Holly insisted Kira come with us. It'll be weird without her, she said. And honestly, I was relieved. We'd always done everything as a trio. Since seventh grade, anyway. So every date, Kira was there. We'd make her sit between us at the movies, all because Holly and I both wanted to be able to hear her jokes and hilarious side comments. I love watching her hide her face in her jacket during scary scenes. And at fancy restaurants, whenever Holly and I would run out of things to talk about and start staring at our menus in panic, Kira would jump in with the funniest stories to keep us going. People thought it was weird, but I was having the best summer of my life. With her around, I didn't have to think about how to date someone. The hangouts and conversations just came naturally. Even our families got used to it. Holly's mom started automatically setting three places at dinner. My dad called Kira the relationship translator. So when Kira couldn't make it to the next big date, let's just say it was a real eye opener. Holly's cousin was getting married in San Diego, and I was her plus one. I told her to take Kira instead, but Kira insisted. You guys will be fine. It's just two Days enjoy some romancing, too. But she was wrong. The car ride on the way there was painful. Holly and I fought each other over Spotify, arguing whether her podcast or my music was the best choice. We eventually just switched to complete silence, making the four hour drive feel more like 12. At the wedding, we sat through dinner barely talking, realizing we never really had much to say without Kira around to prompt us. Even when we slow dance together, other couples were lost in each other while we were mechanically following the steps like a recital. Back at the hotel, Holly kicked off her heels and flopped on the bed. This is weird without Kira, she said. I sat down next to her. I was just thinking that without discussing it. We both pulled out our phones and Facetimed her. She answered from her grandma's hospital room, whispering so she wouldn't wake her up. For 20 minutes. She made us laugh with stories about the nurses and her grandma hitting on the doctor. When we hung up, the room went quiet again. Holly turned to look at me. Why is this so hard when she's not around? I knew exactly what she meant. We haven't had a single real conversation all day. I'm exhausted trying to be your perfect boyfriend girlfriend, we both said at the same time. We looked at each other and started laughing. How bad would it be if we just broke up?

That was my reality. By 17, they claimed I owe them $300,000 in joy debt. They had color coded spreadsheets tracking every smile, every laugh, every moment of happiness I'd stolen from them. Since I could walk. I Learned to keep my face blank. Stone cold nothing. They said I was stealing their peace by being happy. So they'd actually Bill other families when I smiled around their kids $25 for infectious joy contamination. They called it. My childhood became a financial transaction. Giggling at a cartoon, that's $15. Smiling at a dog, another $5. They had categories for everything. Spontaneous laughter was $20, but if they deemed it excessive, it jumped to $40. Birthday parties were banned because they called them joy festivals. That would bankrupt me. I ate lunch alone in bathroom stalls because sitting with friends meant potential joy charges if someone told a joke. I slept on the floor in my room because my mattress was collateral for unpaid happy. They pulled me from art class, music class, any elective that might spark joy, because college isn't for debtors anyway. The worst part? They made me sign contracts.

After seven months of failed attempts, my husband Kyle and I announced that we were finally pregnant. Everyone erupted with cheers, except for my sister Jacqueline, who smashed her wine glass against the marble counter. How dare you! She shrieked. You know how long I've been trying for a baby. I deserve to be the first. Mom tried to tell her 19 year olds aren't ready for a baby, but Jacqueline refused to back down. She grabbed her purse and dramatically stormed out, yelling that I better abort my baby within one week, or else she's getting the police involved. The next morning, she showed up at our door with printed pages from abortion clinics, shoving them into Kyle's chest while he was still in his boxers. I made appointments for her at three different places. She announced to our entire cul de sac, she just needs to pick one. When Kyle tore up the papers, called the whole family, demanding an emergency intervention. That Sunday, 23 relatives crammed into Mom's living room while Jacqueline stood at the fireplace like she was delivering a T E D. Talk on why I was destroying her life by having a baby first. She actually had a Powerpoint. Our Uncle Jeffrey, who's a lawyer, finally told her, there's no legal precedent for forcing someone to abort because you want to be pregnant first. She pointed at me with tears streaming down Her face. And said if I didn't terminate by Monday, she'd never speak to any of us again. But we called her bluff, and all 23 of us told her, see you, Felicia. She actually left sobbing, and we didn't hear from her for a long time. And then, seven months into my pregnancy, we were having our baby shower. When the door flew open. It was Jacqueline. She walked in with her hand on a massive belly, wearing a shirt that said first grandchild loading. Everyone went silent. Mom dropped her cake knife. Surprise! I'm almost due! She announced, spinning around so everyone could see. I got pregnant right after that horrible meeting where you all betrayed me. I'm 10 weeks away from giving birth. Nobody was impressed. And when I decided to screw with her and mentioned my due date that was eight weeks. Weeks away, her face turned deep red with anger. She grabbed my arm and whispered the dates didn't matter because she'd make sure hers came first, then left before anyone could respond. My mom called me that Tuesday, bawling her eyes out. She'd found out from Jacqueline's roommate that Jacqueline had been taking black market labor induction substances she'd bought from some website in Romania, risking her baby's life to deliver before me. Now Jacqueline was in the ICU, but not because of the substances. Turns out Jacqueline had found some girl on Craigslist whose mother used to be a midwife in the Philippines. And paid this girl to perform a C section in her living room. The girl kept refusing, saying Jacqueline was only 31 weeks. But my sister threatened to do it herself with kitchen knives if she didn't help. They used box butter sterilized with vodka. Jacqueline lost so much blood that her neighbor saw it seeping under the apartment door. The baby somehow came out alive, but he was purple and barely breathing. They both nearly died in the ambulance. Baby went straight to the NICU on a ventilator, and Jacqueline needed a full hysterectomy. She'd never have another child. When she came to, the first thing she did was call me from her hospital bed. You did this? She gasped through the oxygen mask. My baby is dying because you couldn't wait until me to have a child. The craziest part about all this is now that she was fighting for life, suddenly, the family was split down the middle. One half thought she'd lost her mind.

Kira insisted. You guys will be fine. It's just two days. Enjoy. Some romancing, too, but she was wrong. The car ride on the way there was painful. Holly and I fought each other over Spotify, arguing whether her podcast or my music was the best choice. We eventually just switched to complete silence, making the four hour drive feel more like 12. At the wedding, we sat through dinner barely talking, realizing we never really had much to say without Kira around to prompt us. Even when we slow dance together, other couples were lost in each other while we were mechanically following the steps like a recital. Back at the hotel, Holly kicked off her heels and flopped on the bed. This is weird without Kira, she said. I sat down next to her. I was just thinking that. Without discussing it, we both pulled out our phones and Facetimed her. She answered from her grandma's hospital room, whispering so she wouldn't wake her up. For 20 minutes. She made us laugh with stories about the nurses and her.

My wedding reception was perfect until my mother in law, Lydia, grabbed the microphone during toasts. She had already spent 10 minutes telling everyone how I trapped her precious baby boy when she turned to me in front of 200 people. You wanna know your biggest problem, sweetie? You are so fake with all that phony sweetness it makes me want to puke. Everyone stopped eating and stared at us. All that please, thank you garbage and pretending you actually care what people think when we all know you are just a manipulative little gold digger. You are going to stop lying and tell me the absolute truth about everything, or I will make your life so miserable you will wish you never met my son. I looked at my horrified guests and my embarrassed husband before responding calmly into the microphone she had shoved at me. You want me to never lie and always tell you the complete truth about everything? She crossed her arms and smirked at me. That is exactly what I want, and I want it to start right now. I smiled at my new husband and then at her. Okay, then. Brutal honesty it is. At Thanksgiving, she made the mistake of asking why I seemed so quiet lately. Honestly, it's because I found out you told everyone at your church that I had an abortion when I have never Even been pregnant. So now 30 random strangers pray for my murdered baby every Sunday. The entire table went silent as Lydia went pale. I, I, um. He stumbled. I don't want to hear your excuses. They'll just be useless, I told her. Desperate to change the subject, she asked if everyone was enjoying her famous Turkey dinner. Of course I gave her the honesty. She demanded. No, your gravy tastes like you mixed flour or with hot dog water. And I can still hear the Turkey gobbling. Everyone stopped chewing, and I pushed my plate away. I would feed this to the dog, but I think that would be animal abuse. Later, she asked if her new dress looked nice for the family photos. You look like you got dressed in the dark, and that colour makes your skin look like raw chicken. Her face went red as I continued. Also, the way it stretched across your body really shows every single fat roll you're trying to hide. Her sister laughed so hard that she spit her wine across the table. When she asked if people were having a good time, I kept being honest. Nobody really wants to be here because your house smells like cat piss. Finally, she asked why nobody wanted to go Black Friday shopping with her this year. It's because last year you pepper sprayed a grandmother over a TV that wasn't even on sale. You also always make everyone hold your purse while you Try on clothes that are clearly three sizes too small. By Christmas, she was trying really hard to avoid asking me direct questions, but she slipped up constantly. When she asked if I like the sweater she spent two months knitting, I gave her the brutal honesty she had demanded. It looks like you Learned to knit during a seizure. She started tearing up, but I didn't feel bad for her because she had asked for the truth. At dinner, she asked if we like the Christmas decorations that she had spent thousands of dollars on. No, your house looks like Christmas. Threw up after eating

I replied, okay. Within a month, they took those words back. On the morning of my 16th birthday, my parents staged what they called an independence intervention. They sat me down at the kitchen table with printed Powerpoint slides and everything. Starting today, you're completely on your own, my mother announced, sliding a laminated card across the table that read, welcome to the real world. No more car rides to anywhere. You walk, bike, or figure it out. No more cooked meals, either. The kitchen is available, but you buy and prepare your own food. No more laundry service. No more wake up calls. No more anything. We're done enabling your dependence. My father nodded sagely, adding, you'll thank us when you're thriving at 30. I studied their smug faces. Okay, I said calmly, already planning my next complete independence. They smiled, missing the careful phrasing entirely. Within 48 hours, I'd secured a job at a tech repair shop that paid surprisingly well for someone who could fix literally anything electronic. By week two, I'd negotiated a deal with my elderly neighbor, Missus Kapoor, for food. I do her grocery runs and tech support in exchange for home cooked meals. Meanwhile, the household began its slow descent into chaos. First, the Wi-Fi crashed during Dad's critical zoom presentation with Hong Kong. He stood outside my locked door for 20 minutes, pleading, just this once, buddy. It's important. But I had Headphones on at dinner, he slammed his fist on the table. You knew I had that meeting. Why didn't you help me? I don't live here anymore, remember? I'm just a tenant who pays no rent. Would you fix your neighbor's W I F I? I replied, eating missus Kapoor's dumplings. Mom's phone stopped receiving emails, and I refused to fix it for her, making her miss three work deadlines. This is sabotage, she accused, cornering me in the hallway. You're being vindictive, you said. I'm on my own. That means household tech support isn't my job anymore, I said, walking past her to my paid shift. The refrigerator's water filter I'd secretly maintained for three years started dispensing gray water. Mom gagged on it during her morning coffee, then spent $400 on emergency plumber visits before realizing it was just the filter. Why didn't you tell us? She demanded. You cut me off from family support. Why would I maintain household infrastructure for people I don't live with? The garage door opener needed reprogramming after a power outage trapping mom's car. She missed her promotion interview while waiting for the repair guy. This is your fault! She screamed through my door. You've made your point. What point? You said, I'm not your responsibility, so your house problems aren't mine. I could tell they were losing their sanity. The complete system collapse happened during their 20th anniversary party, which they'd foolishly decided to host at home. The printer wouldn't connect. To Mom's laptop. Get in here now! She shrieked from their bedroom. Sorry, I don't work here. I'm an independent adult with my own job, I called back. Heading out to my shift, she hand wrote 30 menus, cramping her hand so badly she needed ice. Quietly sobbing from frustration, the smart home system I'd configured started playing death metal at full volume instead. Jazz. Dad frantically pressed every button on his phone while guests covered their ears. What did you do? He roared up the stairs. Nothing. I don't live here anymore! According to you, I texted back, the automatic lights kept shutting off every two minutes, plunging horrified guests into darkness. Mid conversation, mom literally got on her knees in front of my door. Please, I'm begging you, just fix the lights!

My friend Holly and I were voted couple most likely to get married in the yearbook, even though we told everyone we would never date. But I get why. She was a beautiful homecoming queen and I was football captain. The usual cliche, except, you know, we weren't jerks to everyone like in those movies. So, yeah, the pressure was ridiculous. Every school event, every party, even parent teacher conferences, someone would pull me or Holly aside and ask when we were finally going to date. Our homeroom teacher literally started a betting pool. The only person who listened was my best friend Kira, who told us, you guys don't have to date just because everyone else wants you to. But I. I didn't realize she had told us that for a really good reason. Something I found out way later. When Justin Bieber said, never say never, he was right. Because at our classmates pool party, it finally happened. Holly and I were sitting by the fire pit, everyone chanting, kiss, kiss, kiss! Yes! Like we were in middle school. She looked at me, rolled her eyes, and said, let's just get this over with. When we kissed, everyone literally cheered. To me, it felt like nothing. Not bad, not good. Just literally pressing your face to another human being. But since everyone was so happy about it, we started dating. And everything went smoothly, right? Not exactly. But it did lead to something so much better. To be fair, our dates weren't that bad. Our first official date was that weekend. Holly insisted Kira come with us. It'll be weird without her, she said. And honestly, I was relieved. We'd always done everything as a trio. Since seventh grade, anyway. So every date, Kira was there. We'd make her sit between us at the movies, all because Holly and I both wanted to be able to hear her jokes and hilarious side comments. And I loved watching her hide her face in her jacket during scary scenes at fancy restaurants. Whenever Holly and I would run out of things to talk about and start staring at our menus in panic, Kira would jump in with the funniest stories to keep us going. People thought it was weird, but I was having the best summer of my life. With her around, I didn't have to think about how to date someone. The hangouts and conversations just came naturally. Even our families got used to it. Holly's mom started automatically setting three places at dinner. My dad called Kira the relationship translator. So when Kira couldn't make it to the next big date, let's just say it was a real eye opener. Holly's cousin was getting married in San Diego, and I was her plus one. I told her to take Kira instead, but Kira insisted. You guys will be fine. It's Just two days. Enjoy some romancing, too. But she was wrong. The car ride on the way there was painful. Holly and I fought each other over Spotify, arguing whether her podcast or my music was the best choice. We eventually just switched to complete silence, making the four hour drive feel more like 12. At the wedding, we sat through dinner barely talking, realizing we never really had much to say without Kira around to prompt us. Even when we slow dance together, other couples were lost in each other while we were mechanically following the steps like a recital.

We both pulled out our phones and Facetimed her. She answered from her grandma's hospital room, whispering so she wouldn't wake her up. For 20 minutes, she made us laugh with stories about the nurses and her grandma hitting on the doctor. When we hung up, the room went quiet again. Holly turned to look at me. Why is this so hard when she's not around? I knew exactly what she meant. We haven't had a single real conversation all day. I'm exhausted. Trying to be your perfect boyfriend girlfriend, we both said at the same time. We looked at each other and started laughing. How bad would it be if we just broke Up? She asked

After seven months of failed attempts, my husband Kyle and I announced that we were finally pregnant. Everyone erupted with cheers, except for my sister Jacqueline, who smashed her wine glass against the marble counter. How dare you! She shrieked. You know how long I've been trying for a baby. I deserve to be the first. Mom tried to tell her 19 year olds aren't ready for a baby, but Jacqueline refused to back down. She grabbed her purse and dramatically stormed out, yelling that I better abort my baby within one week, or else she's getting the police involved. The next morning, she showed up at our door with printed pages from abortion clinics, shoving them into Kyle's chest while he was still in his boxers. I made appointments for her at three different places. She announced to our entire cul de sac, she just needs to pick one. When Kyle tore up the papers, called the whole family, demanding an emergency intervention. That Sunday, 23 relatives crammed into Mom's living room while Jacqueline stood at the fireplace like she was delivering a T E D. Talk on why I was destroying her life by having a baby first. She actually had a Powerpoint. Our Uncle Jeffrey, who's a lawyer, finally told her, there's no legal precedent for forcing someone to abort because you want to be pregnant first. She pointed at me with tears streaming down Her face. And said if I didn't terminate by Monday, she'd never speak to any of us again. But we called her bluff, and all 23 of us told her, see you, Felicia. She actually left sobbing, and we didn't hear from her for a long time. And then, seven months into my pregnancy, we were having our baby shower when the door or flew open. It was Jacqueline. She walked in with her hand on a massive belly, wearing a shirt that said first grandchild loading. Everyone went silent. Mom dropped her cake knife. Surprise! I'm almost due! She announced, spinning around so everyone could see. I got pregnant right after that horrible meeting where you all betrayed me. I'm 10 weeks away from giving birth. Nobody was impressed. And when I decided to screw with her and mentioned my due date that was eight weeks. Weeks away, her face turned deep red with anger. She grabbed my arm and whispered the dates didn't matter because she'd make sure hers came first, then left before anyone could respond. My mom called me that Tuesday, bawling her eyes out. She'd found out from Jacqueline's roommate that Jacqueline had been taking black market labor induction substances she'd bought from some website in Romania, risking her baby's life to deliver before me. Now Jacqueline was in the ICU, but not because of the substances. Turns out Jacqueline had found some girl on Craigslist whose mother used to be a midwife in the Philippines and paid this girl to perform a C section in her living room. The girl kept refusing, saying Jacqueline was only 31 weeks. But my sister threatened to do it herself with kitchen knives if she didn't help. They used box butter sterilized with vodka. Jacqueline lost so much blood that her neighbor saw it seeping under the apartment door. The baby somehow came out alive, but he was purple and barely breathing. They both nearly died in the ambulance. The baby went straight to the NICU on a ventilator, and Jacqueline needed a full hysterectomy. She'd never have another child. When she came to, the first thing she did was.

I was grilling burgers when will grab the mic for his speech. Everyone thought he was drunk again. Then he pointed at my daughter Emily and said, funny how she looks exactly like me, not her dad. The backyard went silent. My wife Mara's face went white. What did you just say? I asked, but I already knew. Will laughed. Come on, Jackson. 18 years of playing house. Emily's mine. I felt my knees buckle. Emily was staring between us, confused. Dad, what's he talking about? Mara was shaking her head frantically. Will, stop! You're drunk. DNA test, he slurred, pulling out his phone. Got it done last month. 99.9% match. The burger spatula fell from my hands. 18 years. Every birthday, every scraped knee, every bedtime story. All built on a lie. You're lying! Emily screamed at will, but her voice cracked like she wasn't sure. My brother. My own brother shrugged. Sorry, man. Had to come out sometime. I looked at my wife, the woman I'd loved for 20 years. Is it true she couldn't meet my eyes? That was answer enough. Emily ran inside, crying. Half the part already followed her. The other half just stared at me like I was some tragic zoo animal. Will walked over and patted my shoulder. No hard feelings, right? I've never hit anyone in my life, but hearing the crack of his nose breaking felt better than Any therapy ever could. Will hit the ground hard. My mom screamed. But I wasn't done. 20 years of marriage, 18 years of fatherhood, all stolen from me. You wanna know what's really funny? I said, standing over him. I've been paying for Emily's college fund, her car, everything. Will was holding his nose. Jackson, please. I've been the uncle, I continued. You've been playing dad with my money. That's when Mara finally spoke. It wasn't supposed to happen like this. I turned to her. When did it start? Right after Emily was born. She. I whispered. You were working so much. Will was always around, helping himself to my wife. Emily came back outside, tears streaming. Dad, please tell me this isn't real. The word dad hit different now. Like a knife twisting. I don't know what I am anymore. Sweetheart. Will struggled to his feet. Look, we can work this out. Split custody or something. Custody? I laughed. You think I'm sharing anything else with you? My sister grabbed my arm. Jackson, calm down. Calm down. My brother just announced he's been sleeping with my wife for 18 years. At my retirement party, dad was sitting in his lawn chair, looking like he'd aged and years. Mom was crying into her potato salad. Will wiped his face. We never meant for it to go this long. 18 years, will. 18 years. Emily looked between us for the first time. I saw it. The nose, the eyes. How had I been so blind. Am I really not your daughter? She asked me. My heart shattered. You'll always be my daughter, M. Biology doesn't change that. But even as I said it, I knew everything had changed forever. Will started walking toward his car. I'll give you space to process this, ace. I followed him. You're not going anywhere. I grabbed his keys. You created this mess. You're going to face it. Maura finally found her voice. Jackson let him go. Oh, so now you're protecting him in front of everyone? The entire party was watching our family implode in real time. Ants, uncles, cousins. All witnesses to the destruction. Will turned back. What do you want from me? I want my life back. I said I want my daughter back. I want 18 years back. I can't give you that. And give me everything else. That's when I realized what I had to do. The nuclear option. I pulled out my phone and called my lawyer right there in front of everyone. Mike, it's Jackson. I need you to start divorce proceedings.

I said, cool. Then I started having dinners with her best friend. Been married to Nyla for three years when she makes this announcement over dinner. I need to get Gail out of my system. Just one night. Then I can fully commit to us. My fork stops midway to my mouth. Gail? Your ex Gail, the one who cheated on you? Yeah, but it's just closure. One time to realize what I have with you is better. She's cutting her steak like she just mentioned changing our Netflix password. I keep my voice steady. Just one night. She nods. One night. That's all I need. And then we're good. Then we're perfect. No more wondering, no more what ifs. The red flags have never been redder, but I simply nod. Sure. If that's what you need. Her eyes widen like she expected a fight. The night arrives two weeks later. She gets ready like it's a Hollywood premiere. New dress, perfume that costs more than our groceries. Heels she bought yesterday. For closure? I ask. I want to feel confident. She adjusts her earrings. Don't wait up. Might need time to process. She leaves at 8 p. M. I'm watching Netflix when my phone lights up. Text from her best friend Zara hey, this is weird, but I just saw Nyla's location. She sends a screenshot. It's a hotel. She's Been there Monday, Wednesday and tonight. This is her fourth time there, not counting last week. Zara sends another screenshot. Nyla told me she needed one night with Gale to move on. I didn't realize she meant one night per week. Everything clicks. The new lingerie charges, the random evening walks. The sudden interest in yoga that required shower trips. After she's been sleeping with him repeatedly, not just once. I text back, Wanna grab dinner tomorrow? Are you asking me on a date? Just dinner. That Italian place downtown. Wear something nice to make Nyla jealous. To give her exactly what she's been giving me. Nothing physical, just suspense. Just dinners. Pick me up at 8. Nyla comes home at 2:00am, sliding into bed, smelling like Cologne that isn't mine. How was your closure? I ask in the darkness. Perfect. I'm all yours now. She presses against me. You're the most understanding husband. Saturday evening, I tell Nyla I have a client. Emergency software crisis. Could take hours. She barely glances up from her phone, already texting someone. Twenty minutes later, I'm at the Italian restaurant with Zara. She's dressed perfectly. Black dress, subtle makeup, enough effort to look suspicious. We order wine, appetizers, discuss anything except Nyla. I post a story. Two wine glasses, dim lighting. Caption, crisis management requires good wine. My phone explodes immediately. Nyla calling. I let it ring. She texts, where are you? No response. Another text. Who's the second glass for? Zara sees The messages. She's spiraling. Perfect. We order entrees. Keep posting. Her manicured hand near mine. The long night ahead option, with Zara's laugh captured mid frame. Never her full face, but enough details Nyla would recognize. Three more dinners that week, each one scheduled precisely when Nyla has her Pilates or work emergencies. Same timing she keeps, same vague explanations. Zara understands the assignment perfectly. We're having actual dinners, genuine conversations. But every photo looks questionable. Calculated. Intimate. Friday night. Nyla is preparing again. Emergency budget meeting. I asked Kat. Actually. Yeah. Quarter end stuff. She's applying perfume for spreadsheets. Funny. I have that software deployment dinner. Another one. Her hand freezes mid spray. Big contract pending. I adjust my watch. Could go late. She leaves first. I wait 15 minutes, then meet Zara at the exact restaurant Nyla and Gail frequent. Make a booth near the entrance. She'll see us when she arrives. At 9:52 p m, Nyla walks in with Gail. Spots us immediately. Me and Zara heads close together, sharing dessert, laughing at something on her phone. Nyla stops dead. Gail continues walking, oblivious. She's calling me instantly. I set it to silent. She marches over. Gail abandoned at the host stand. What is happening here? Her voice shake

When I first met Kevin, he mentioned this dream he had of visiting Paris someday. He'd get all dreamy, talking about the cafes, the art museums, the whole romantic vibe. Problem was, he barely spoke any French beyond Bonjour and croissant. I thought it would be the most romantic surprise ever if I secretly Learned his dream language. Every Tuesday and Thursday after work, I drove 20 minutes across town to this little community center for French classes. The teacher was this elderly woman named Madame Rousseau, who wore bright red lipstick and corrected our pronunciation like a drill sergeant. I told Kevin I was taking yoga classes with my coworker, Amy. He bought it completely. For two years, I practiced conjugating birds while making dinner. I'd whisper French phrases while he watched Netflix in the living room. I even started dreaming in French sometimes, which felt like a major accomplishment. I bought French romance novels and struggled through them with my phone dictionary. I wanted to be fluent enough to have actual conversations with locals. When we finally took that Paris trip, my plan was to surprise him on our fifth anniversary dinner at that fancy steakhouse downtown. I had it all mapped out. I'd order the entire meal in perfect French, then tell him about the language classes, and surprise him with already booked plane tickets to Paris. I'd saved up $3,000 in a secret account just for this trip. But three weeks before our anniversary, Kevin sat me down after dinner with this weird, serious expression. He started fumbling with his wedding ring, which he only did when he was really nervous. Jessica, we need to talk about something important, he said, not making eye contact. My stomach dropped instantly. He explained that he'd been struggling with our relationship for months and needed space to figure things out. He kept using phrases like personal growth and finding himself while I sat there in complete shock. The worst part was how rehearsed it all sounded, like he'd practice the speech multiple times in his car. I think I should move back in with my brother for a while, he said, still staring at the table. Just temporarily, to clear my head. I wanted to scream about the French classes, about Paris, about how I've been planning this perfect surprise. Instead, I just nodded and said okay, because what else could I do? The next morning, he packed two suitcases and left. He took his PlayStation, his favorite coffee mug, and that stupid motivational poster from our bedroom wall. The house felt enormous and empty without his stuff everywhere. I kept expecting him to walk through the door and say it was all a mistake. Week later, I was stress eating cereal for dinner when Amy called. She'd seen Kevin at some bar across town, laughing with his co Workers and this blonde woman from his office named Stephanie. Apparently they looked pretty cozy together. I'm probably wrong, Amy said, but I thought you should know. That's when everything clicked. The late work meetings, the new

And I watched her delete her birth control reminder right there at the table. I saw it. Her sister saw it, too, and her mouth fell open. Then she walked away. What? I asked, because we'd agreed to wait two more years. Tonight. We start tonight or I find someone who will. He said it like she was ordering coffee. Mike already offered, Rachel said. Your friend Mike. He said he'd help if you won't. I felt my throat close up. Mike? My college roommate Mike. This is crazy. I told her. That's insane. I told her what's insane is waiting while my eggs die. She grabbed my wrist. My hands started shaking. So tonight or I start looking? She asked louder. Fine, I said. Start looking. Rachel's mouth opened, but nothing came out. Then she laughed. You're bluffing. The next morning, I created her a tinder profile while she was in the shower. Rachel, 34, married, but looking for a baby daddy ASAP. Husband approved. I used our wedding photos and everything. When she came out, I showed her three matches. What the hell is this? She asked. You said, find someone else. I'm helping. Her face got all twisted. I didn't mean Tom here, Has two kids already, so we know he works. I swiped right on Tom. She grabbed for my phone, but I pulled it away. Delete it right now. No. You wanted this. That afternoon, introduced her to my coworker James at lunch. This is Rachel. She's looking for someone to get her pregnant. James choked on his sandwich. Rachel kicked me under the table. He's joking, she said. I'm not. She gave me an ultimatum yesterday. You have three kids, right, James? James stood up and left without finishing his food. Rachel's face was purple. Stop this immediately. You literally threatened to fuck Mike? She slapped me. The whole restaurant went quiet. Two weeks in, I'd scheduled her five, nine dates. I picked a different divorced dad each time. This is Brian, I told her when the first one showed up. Four kids, all healthy, good genes. Brian looked confused. Used. I thought this was a regular date. It is. She just needs to know about your sperm count. Rachel locked herself in the bathroom while Brian left. The next day, I asked the mailman if he wanted kids. My wife needs a baby immediately, I explained, while Rachel watched from the window. The mailman started avoiding our house completely. I asked the grocery store clerk, the pharmacist, our neighbor Greg. She's very fertile right now. I'd say peak ovulation. Rachel stopped leaving the house with me. Then her mom found the tinder profile file. She called during dinner, screaming, Through the speaker. What is this filth? Looking for a baby, daddy? Mom, I can explain. Your profile says husband approved. I leaned toward the phone. She threatened to cheat if I didn't give her a baby immediately. Dead silence. Then her dad's voice. Rachel Marie, is this true? She started crying. I just wanted to start our family. By threatening adultery? Her mom asked. The call ended. Rachel threw her plate at me. It missed and shattered against the wall. By week three, everyone knew. Her co workers had seen the profile. Her friends were sending her screenshots. I'd introduced her to 12 different men. As desperately seeking pregnancy. She couldn't go anywhere without someone.

After seven months of failed attempts, my husband Kyle and I announced that we were finally pregnant. Everyone erupted with cheers, except for my sister Jacqueline, who smashed her wine glass against the marble counter. How dare you! She shrieked. You know how long I've been trying for a baby. I deserve to be the first. Mom tried to tell her 19 year olds aren't ready for a baby, but Jacqueline refused to back down. She grabbed her purse and dramatically stormed out, yelling that I better abort my baby within one week, or else she's getting the police involved. The next morning, she showed up at our door with printed pages from abortion clinics, shoving them into Kyle's chest while he was still in his boxers. I made appointments for her at three different places. She announced to our entire cul de sac, she just needs to pick one. When Kyle tore up the papers, called the whole family, demanding an emergency intervention. That Sunday, 23 relatives crammed into Mom's living room while Jacqueline stood at the fireplace like she was delivering a T E D. Talk on why I was destroying her life by having a baby first. She actually had a Powerpoint. Our Uncle Jeffrey, who's a lawyer, finally told her, there's no legal precedent for forcing someone to abort because you want to be pregnant first. She pointed at me with tears streaming down Her face. And said if I didn't terminate by Monday, she'd never speak to any of us again. But we called her bluff, and all 23 of us told her, see you, Felicia. She actually left sobbing, and we didn't hear from her for a long time. And then, seven months into my pregnancy, we were having our baby shower when the door or flew open. It was Jacqueline. She walked in with her hand on a massive belly, wearing a shirt that said first grandchild loading. Everyone went silent. Mom dropped her cake knife. Surprise! I'm almost due! She announced, spinning around so everyone could see. I got pregnant right after that horrible meeting where you all betrayed me. I'm 10 weeks away from giving birth. Nobody was impressed. And when I decided to screw with her and mentioned my due date that was eight weeks. Weeks away, her face turned deep red with anger. She grabbed my arm and whispered the dates didn't matter because she'd make sure hers came first, then left before anyone could respond. My mom called me that Tuesday, bawling her eyes out. She'd found out from Jacqueline's roommate that Jacqueline had been taking black market labor induction substances she'd bought from some website in Romania, risking her baby's life to deliver before me. Now Jacqueline was in the ICU, but not because of the substances. Turns out Jacqueline had found some girl on Craigslist whose mother used to be a midwife in the Philippines and paid this girl to perform a C section in her living room. The girl kept refusing, saying Jacqueline was only 31 weeks. But my sister threatened to do it herself with kitchen knives if she didn't help. They used box butter sterilized with vodka. Jacqueline lost so much blood that her neighbor saw it seeping under the apartment door. The baby somehow came out alive, but he was purple and barely breathing. They both nearly died in the ambulance. Baby went straight to the NICU on a ventilator, and Jacqueline needed a full hysterectomy. She'd never have another child. When she came to, the first thing she did was call me from her hospital bed. You did this? She gasped through the oxygen mask. My baby is dying because you couldn't wait until me to have a child. The craziest part about all this is now that she was fighting for life. Suddenly, the family was split.

I was in after school detention with 40 other kids when someone burst through the door. It was Kayla from my math class, shaking really bad. There's someone outside, she said, trying to catch her breath. By the back entrance. Then she started crying. He has a knife. I felt my whole body go cold. Miss Franklin didn't even look up from her magazine. Nice try, Kayla. That's an extra hour for lying. She pointed at an empty seat. Sit down before I call your parents. Kayla basically fell into the chair. Then we heard this alarm going off. It wasn't the regular bell. The principal's voice came through the hallway speakers. Code red lockdown. This is not a drill. My hands started trembling. Miss Franklin rolled her eyes and locked our door. But she left all the lights on. Another fake drill. Keep working on your assignments. Then I heard a man's voice outside yelling something. I couldn't understand the words, but he sounded terrified. Security guards ran past our. Our door radios going crazy. Miss Franklin stood in front of the door window so we couldn't see out. Everyone stay in your seats. The hallway lights went off. I watched. Darkness spread under our door. Other classrooms went black, but our detention room stayed bright. All 40 of us sitting there under the lights where anyone could see us. This was the big monthly Detention for serious infractions. Then I heard footsteps. Slow and careful. They stopped at our door. The handle started moving. My heart was beating so hard, I thought everyone could hear it. The handle twisted harder. These doors looked solid, but I'd seen kids pop them open with credit cards. The footsteps moved away, but I knew they'd be back. My phone lit up. Are you safe? School on news, Miss Franklin saw kids checking phones. Put those away or I'm taking them, she snapped. But she stayed by the door instead of collecting them. Glass broke somewhere in the building. Not super close, but not far, either. Kids started sliding under desks. Back in your seats! Miss Franklin yelled, voice shaky. This is just a prank! Sweat was running down her face. The footsteps came back, checking each door. When they got to the room next door, the whole wall shook. Someone was trying to break in, getting closer. Everyone stared at our door's little window. We stuck out in the dark building. Miss Franklin gripped her desk, but still wouldn't turn off the lights. Police would be here if this was real, she said quietly. A kid in back whispered he'd already called 9 1 1. Miss Franklin didn't hear him. We felt a bit of hope help was coming, but I could hear someone breathing hard outside our door. Now the door got hit hard. It bent inward and paint chips flew off. I jumped up and Ran for the light switch. Miss Franklin left her spot to block me. Sit down or you're suspended! Turn off the lights! Someone yelled. Half the class was on their feet. Miss Franklin spread her arms to block us. Nobody moves! You'll all fail! Another hit! Louder! The door frame split and wood flew across the room. I grabbed a desk and shoved it against the door. Other kids started doing the same. We built a wall of furniture. While Miss Franklin screamed about destroying property. She grabbed a desk.

The window frame creaked as I pulled myself through, thinking I'd successfully snuck back from Carter's party at 2 a m. But the second my feet hit the bedroom floor, the lamp clicked on, and there sat my dad in my desk chair, my laptop open in front of him, displaying every single text between me and Carter from the past three months. I knew I was dead. Fun night, he said, pulling up the pictures I sent him. I was so embarrassed because he started lecturing me on getting pregnant. You did this to yourself. Ali is going back to the shelter tomorrow morning. My heart fell through the floor as I processed what he was saying. Ali, the golden retriever puppy I'd gotten for my 16th birthday just two weeks ago. The dog I've been begging for since I was 7. The only thing that made being trapped in this house bearable. You can't do that! He's mine! You gave him to me! I sobbed, but my dad was already walking toward the door. The next morning, I watched through tear blurred eyes as dad loaded Ollie into the car, the puppies confused, whimpering, breaking what was left of my heart. And I spent the entire day in my room, refusing to eat, refusing to talk to them. Just stay staring at Ali's empty bed in the corner and the toy rope he'd left behind. By 11 p m, When I heard my parents go to bed, their bedroom door clicking shut with finality, I knew what I had to do. I was getting my effing dog back this time. I didn't even bother being quiet as I went out the front door, not caring if they heard me, not caring about consequences anymore. The animal shelter was only a mile away, and when I got there, I marched straight to the desk with tears streaming down my face. I sobbed out a story about how my parents had accidentally brought in my emotional support animal, how I had severe anxiety and needed him back immediately, how it was all a terrible misunderstanding. Please, I begged. He's microchipped under my name. I can prove he's mine. This is all just a huge mistake. My parents didn't realize what they were doing. After what felt like an eternity of back and forth of me showing every photo and video I had of tears and pleading, she finally relented, saying she could make an exception given the circumstances. I was walking out with Ali bouncing happily beside me, his tail wagging frantically, when I heard someone shout, wait! Stop! You can't take that dog! But I didn't look back, just started running, with Ali keeping pace, both of us sprinting through the parking lot and into the darkness of the suburban streets. My phone stayed silent as I jogged home. No calls from the shelter, no texts from my parents, nothing. They must not have known, noticed I was gone, yet. Probably assumed I was sulking in my room like I've been doing all day. But when I rounded the corner to our street, I saw the weirdest thing. Our front door.

I don't have HIV and never requested that prescription. My vindictive ex boyfriend works there and has been destroying my reputation out of spite. His name is Brett, and we dated for eight months before everything went sideways. He worked at the CVS near my apartment, which was super convenient. When we were together, I'd swing by after work, grab my birth control, and he'd always slip me a free candy bar or something cute like that. He seems so sweet back then, but when I broke up with him last month, he turned into a complete psycho. He couldn't handle that I was done with his controlling garbage. Like, the guy literally threw a tantrum because I wanted to hang out with my friends without him. He'd show up at my work, call me 50 times in a row, the full stalker routine. So yesterday, I went to pick up my actual prescription for anxiety meds. Nothing embarrassing, just standard stuff my doctor prescribed after my panic attack started getting worse. I walked up to the counter like normal, gave them my name and birthday. But instead of Brett helping me like usual, this older pharmacist lady was working. That's when Brett appeared out of nowhere from the back room. He had this weird smirk on his face that immediately made my stomach drop. The lady started looking through the computer system, and Brett walked Right up behind her, he pointed at the screen and said really loudly, oh, yeah, that's the HIV medication for Emma. Make sure you tell her to take it with food. Entire pharmacy went dead silent. There were, like, six people in line behind me, including Missus Garcia from my building, who knows my whole family. Everyone was staring at me. My face turned bright red, and I couldn't even form words. The pharmacist lady looked confused and started saying something about how that wasn't what was showing up in the system, but the damage was already done. I grabbed my actual pills and basically ran out of there. Brett was grinning like he just won the lottery. I could hear people whispering behind me as I left. The worst part is, my apartment building has serious gossip problems. By the time I got home two hours later, my neighbor Ashley was giving me these weird, sympathetic looks in the hallway. My phone started blowing up with texts from people asking if I was okay and if I needed anything. Word travels fast in a small town. I was so angry, I couldn't even think straight. This jerk was literally spreading lies about my health just because I had the nerve to dump him. I knew I had to do something or this rumor would follow me around forever. So I called the CVS corporate number and filed a complaint about employee misconduct. Turned out they take privacy violations super Seriously? Especially fake medical information. The manager called me back within an hour asking for details. I explained everything about our relationship and what Brett had done. They launched an investigation immediately. Apparently, accessing customer medical records without permission is illegal, and making up fake prescriptions is even worse. The manager said they'd already pulled the security cameras and could see Brett clearly interfering with my transaction. Three days later, Brett was fired. Not just fired, but apparently he's facing charges for violating medical privacy laws. The company lawyer called me to apologize and offered

I need an alpha, I replied. I understand. Jessica sat me down in our living room last Tuesday with this rehearsed speech about how she needed someone who takes charge, a real leader. Then came the kicker. She'd been getting close to my coworker, Mark from marketing. He's everything you're not, Michael, she said, her voice dripping with condescension. Confident, ambitious, going places. You're just comfortable being mediocre. I sat there quietly while she explained how Mark was about to get promoted to regional director, the position that would make him everyone's boss, including mine. She'd even been feeding him insider information from her role in HR to help his application look stronger. Once Mark gets that promotion, we'll be the power couple of the office, she grinned, practically glowing with excitement. He's already talking about the company car, the corner office, the executive perks. That's the kind of man I need. She went on about how Mark commanded every room he entered, how he closed deals with a handshake, how he had that killer, her instinct that I apparently lacked, she said watching him work made her realize what she'd been settling for all these years. You're a great guy, Michael, but you're just not leadership material. You'll always be support staff, she said, patting my shoulder like I was a child. Mark sees the big picture. He takes risks. He makes things happen. The insult stung because it was so calculated. She'd Clearly been thinking about this for months, comparing us weighing our worth like commodities. In her mind, she was trading up. I need someone who fights for what they want, she continued. Someone who doesn't just accept things as they are. Mark would never just sit there quietly like you're doing right now. I simply said, I understand and went to bed. Here's what she didn't know. Three weeks ago, corporate had secretly offered me that same regional director position. They said Mark looked impressive in meetings, but consistently made promises the technical team couldn't deliver. His strategy sounded great, but ignored crucial operational realities. We need someone who understands both sides, the VP had told me during our confidential meeting. Someone who can actually execute, not just sell dreams. Mark's proposals look flashy, but half of them would bankrupt us if we tried to implement them. The VP explained that while Mark was great at client presentations, he caused three major project delays in the past year by over promising capability what is we didn't have. Meanwhile, my quiet efficiency had been saving the company millions by designing systems that actually worked. I've been hesitant to accept because I genuinely enjoyed my current role as senior systems architect. I like solving complex problems, building things that work. Management politics wasn't appealing. But after Jessica's speech about needing an alpha and her casual dismissal of my capabilities, my hesitation completely disappeared. Her betrayal had clarified everything. Monday morning, I walked Into the VP's office and accept to the position. Outstanding choice, Michael, he said, shaking my hand firmly. We'll announce it Wednesday. I have to say, we were hoping you'd come around. The board was unanimous. You're exactly what this company needs. That Tuesday, Mark was already celebrating. Prematurely. I heard him on a call with a client making promises about timeline and capabilities that were completely unrealistic. He'd even ordered business cards with regional director printed on them. Jessica texted me from HR saying she was so excited for the big announcement tomorrow that she'd already made dinner reservations to celebrate Mark's promotion. She seemed to think I'd be happy for them. Wednesday at 2 p m. The company wide email went out introducing me as the new regional director, effective immediately. My first directive was restructuring the marketing promises to align with actual technical capabilities, essentially undoing everything Mark had been promising clients. Mark got his rejection

He's back! And three employees immediately ran to the back room. I'm standing there confused, holding my five dollar Bill, when the remaining barista, this girl named Casey, starts whispering to me, that guy behind you. He comes in here every Tuesday and makes our lives miserable. Complains about everything, demands free drinks, threatens to call corporate if we don't give him exactly what he wants. Once I turn around and see this middle aged guy in a wrinkled suit tapping his foot impatiently. He looks exactly like my stepdad, Rick. Same bald head, same angry scowl, same way of standing like the world owes him something. My heart starts racing because Rick has been making my mom's life hell for two years now. He yells at her for burning toast. Those tantrums when dinner isn't ready at exactly 6. And last week I caught him screaming at her because she bought the wrong brand of coffee. The guy starts banging on the counter. Where is everyone? This is ridiculous service! His voice is loud and demanding, just like Rick's when he's having one of his episodes at home. That's when I remembered something my mom told me last month. She said Rick used to work at some office building downtown before he got fired for being difficult with clients. She mentioned he spends his mornings at coffee shops now, complaining about everything because he has nothing else. To do. I pulled out my phone and started recording. Excuse me, sir, what's your name? I asked sweetly. Why do you need to know? He's nap. Just curious. You seem really upset about the service here. He launched into this massive rant about how young people don't know how to work, how he deserves respect, how he's going to get everyone fired. The whole time I'm recording, getting every word. Then he starts bragging about how he does this at multiple coffee shops around town, how he's gotten at least six people fired this month, and how it's his hobby. Now, 20 minutes later, I'm sitting in my car, uploading the video to TikTok with the caption, when Karen's think no one is watching. I tagged the coffee shop and added hashtags about workplace harassment. The video blew up overnight. 3 million views. Thousands of comments from other service workers sharing their own stories about this same guy. Turns out he's been terrorizing coffee shops, restaurants, and retail stores all over our city for months. People started sharing his photo, warning other businesses about him. By Thursday, the local news picked it up. Local man's pattern of harassment exposed on social media. They interviewed Casey and other workers, who confirmed he'd been doing this everywhere. The coffee shop corporate office saw the video and banned him from all their locations.

I was grilling burgers when will grab the mic for his speech. Everyone thought he was drunk again. Then he pointed at my daughter Emily and said, funny how she looks exactly like me, not her dad. The backyard went silent. My wife Mara's face went white. What did you just say? I asked, but I already knew. Will laughed. Come on, Jackson. Eighteen years of playing house. Emily's mine. I felt my knees buckle. Emily was staring between us, confused. Dad, what's he talking about? Mara was shaking her head frantically. Will, stop! You're drunk. DNA test slurred. Pulling out his phone. Got it done last month. 99.9% match. The burger spatula fell from my hands. 18 years. Every birthday, every scraped knee, every bedtime story. All built on a lie. You're lying! Emily screamed at will, but her voice cracked like she wasn't sure. My brother. My own brother shrugged. Sorry, man, to come out sometime. I looked at my wife, the woman I'd loved for 20 years. Is it true she couldn't meet my eyes? That was answer enough. Emily ran inside crying. Half the party followed her. The other half just stared at me like I was some tragic zoo animal. Will walked over and patted my shoulder. No hard feelings, right? I've never hit anyone in my life, but hearing the crack of his nose breaking felt better than any therapy ever. Could will hit the ground hard. My mom screamed. But I wasn't done. 20 years of marriage, 18 years of fatherhood, all from me. You wanna know what's really funny? I said, standing over him. I've been paying for Emily's college fund, her car, everything. Will was holding his nose. Jackson, please. I've been the uncle I can. You've been playing dad with my money. That's when Mara finally spoke. It wasn't supposed to happen like this. I turned to her. When did it start? Right after Emily was born, she whispered. You were working so much. Will was always around, helping himself to my wife. Emily came back outside, tears streaming. Dad, please tell me this isn't real. The word dad hit different now. Like a knife twisting. I don't know what I am anymore, sweetheart. Will struggle to his feet. Look, we can work this out. Split custody or something. Custody? I laughed. You think I'm sharing anything else with you? My sister grabbed my arm. Jackson, calm down. Calm down? My brother just announced he's been sleeping with my wife for 18 years. At my retirement party, dad was sitting in his lawn chair looking like he'd aged and years. Mom was crying into her potato salad. Will wiped his face. We never meant for it to go this long. 18 years, will. 18 years. Emily looked between us for the first time. I saw it. The nose, the eyes. How had I been so blind? Am I really. Not your daughter?

I'll give you space to process this base. I followed him. You're not going anywhere. I grabbed his keys. You created this mess. You're going to face it. Maura finally found her voice. Jackson let him go. Oh, so now you're protecting him in front of everyone? The entire party was watching our family implode in real time. Ants, uncles, cousins. All witnesses to the destruction. Will turned back. What do you want from me? I want my life back. I said. I want my daughter back. I want 18 years back. I can't give you that. Then give me everything else. That's when I realized what I had to do. The nuclear option. I pulled out my phone and called my lawyer right there in front of everyone. Mike, it's Jackson. I need you to start divorce proceedings. And I want a DNA test court ordered tonight. Mara gasped. No! And I wanna know about any joint accounts will has had access to. Will's face went pale. What are you implying? I'm not implying anything. You've been stealing my life. Time to see what else you've been stealing. The party was dead silent, except for my mom's quiet sobbing. Emily grabbed my arm. Dad, please don't do this. Do what? Find out the truth. Will was backing

I was in after school detention with 40 other kids when someone burst through the door. It was Kayla from my math class, shaking really bad. There's someone outside, she said, trying to catch her breath. By the back entrance. Then she started crying. He has a knife. I felt my whole body go cold. Miss Franklin didn't even look up from her magazine. Nice try, Kayla. That's an extra hour for lying. She pointed at an empty seat. Sit down before I call your parents. Kayla basically fell into the chair. Then we heard this alarm going off. It wasn't the regular bell. The principal's voice came through the hallway speakers. Code red lockdown. This is not a drill. My hands started trembling. Miss Franklin rolled her eyes and locked our door. But she left all the lights on. Another fake drill. Keep working on your assignments. Then I heard a man's voice outside yelling something. I couldn't understand the words, but he sounded terrified. Security guards ran past our door, radios going crazy. Miss Franklin stood in front of the door window so we couldn't see out. Everyone stay in your seats. The hallway lights went off. I watched. Darkness spread under our door. Other classrooms went black, but our detention room stayed bright. All 40 of us sitting there under the lights where anyone could see us. This was the big monthly detention For serious infractions. Then I heard footsteps. Slow and careful. They stopped at our door. The handle started moving. My heart was beating so hard, I thought everyone could hear it. The handle twisted harder. These doors looked solid, but I'd seen kid pop them open with credit cards. The footsteps moved away, but I knew they'd be back. My phone lit up. Are you safe? School on news. Miss Franklin saw kids checking phones. Put those away or I'm taking them, she snapped. But she stayed by the door instead of collecting them. Glass broke somewhere in the building. Not super close, but not far either. Kids started sliding under desks. Back in your seats! Miss Franklin yelled, voice shaky. This is just a prank! What? Was running down her face. The footsteps came back, checking each door. When they got to the room next door, the whole wall shook. Someone was trying to break in. Getting closer. Everyone stared at our doors window. We stuck out in the dark building. Miss Franklin gripped her desk, but still wouldn't turn off the lights. The police would be here if this was real, she said quietly. A kid in back whispered he'd already called 9 1 1. Miss Franklin didn't hear him. We felt a bit of hope. Help was coming. I could hear someone breathing hard outside our door. Now the door got hit hard. It bent inward and paint chips flew off. I jumped up and ran for The light switch. Miss Franklin left her spot to block me. Sit down or you're suspended! Turn off the lights! Someone yelled. Half the class was on their feet. Miss Franklin spread her arms to block us. Nobody moves! You'll all fail! Another hit! Louder. The door frame split and wood flew across the room. I grabbed a desk and shoved it against the door. Other kids started doing the same. We built a wall of furniture while Miss Franklin screamed about destroying property. She grabbed at desks, but we kept stacking. Then the biggest hit. Our pile shifted. A gap opened, and I saw fingers wrap around the door edge. Someone was prying it open. We threw ourselves against the desks. Miss Franklin had back to the center of the room. I'm just watching. Metal scraped. The gap got wider. An arm came through. We pushed harder, but the door kept opening. I could see a shadow through the crack, getting bigger. The cheap lock gave away. The door swung.

For 3 years straight, Danny would act surprised when my birthday rolled around. First year he said work was crazy and he'd make it up to me. Second year he claimed his phone died so he lost track of dates. Last year he literally asked me why I seemed upset on February 15th, like he had no clue it was the day after my birthday. Meanwhile, this guy remembered every sports stat from 1995 and could tell you exactly when his favorite show aired each week. He had phone reminders for oil changes, dentist appointments, even when to water his plants. But somehow my birthday was this impossible thing to keep track of. My friends kept telling me to just remind him or send hints, but that felt pathetic. If some someone cares about you, they remember what matters to you without being nagged about it. This year, I decided to test something. Two weeks before my birthday, I started dropping hints everywhere. I left my birth certificate on the kitchen counter. I circled February 14th on the calendar with a big red heart. I even mentioned it during dinner. My birthday is coming up soon, I said, while we ate tacos. He just nodded and kept scrolling his phone. The week before, I got more obvious. I showed him a dress online and said this would be perfect for my birthday dinner next week. He mumbled something about it. Being nice and went back to watching TV. Three days before, I literally said, so what are we doing for my birthday Thursday? He looked confused and asked, what's Thursday? When I told him it was my birthday, he slapped his forehead like he always did and said, right? Yeah, I've been so busy with work stuff. Thursday morning came. I woke up expecting something, anything, maybe flowers by my bedside or breakfast in bed. Nothing. He got dressed, kissed my cheek and said he'd be back late because of a client dinner. Not even a happy birthday. I sat there in my pajamas until noon feeling stupid for hoping things would be different this year. Then I remembered something. His birthday was exactly one month later, March 14th. And for the past four years, I'd thrown him surprise parties, bought expensive gifts, took days off work to plan.

My sister called me a bad mom until her kid told me the truth. When Emma asked if she could dye her hair blue for her 13th birthday, I said, sure. It's just hair, right? She'd been begging me for weeks, showing me Pinterest photos of these gorgeous ocean blue highlights. At target. We picked out some semi permanent dye that would wash out in a month. She was so excited, she could barely sit still while I painted the streaks in our tiny bathroom. The next morning at breakfast, she kept flipping her hair and grinning at herself in the toaster reflection. I made her favorite blueberry pancakes, and she kept saying how the blue and her hair match the berries perfectly. Was honestly the happiest I'd seen her since her dad moved out last year. But when we showed up at my sister Beth's house for Sunday dinner, everything went sideways fast. Beth took one look at Emma, and her face just dropped. He pulled me into the kitchen while Emma was playing with her cousins and started going off about how irresponsible I was being. What kind of message does this send? She whispered harshly, gesturing toward the living room. She's going to look like some delinquent at school. I tried explaining it was just temporary hair dye, that Emma was still getting straight A's and playing violin, but Beth wouldn't hear it. She kept shaking her head and Muttering about how I was clear, really struggling as a single mom and needed to set better boundaries. The whole dinner was awkward after that, with Beth making passive aggressive comments about certain parenting choices every time Emma's hair caught the light. When we got home that night, Emma seemed deflated. She kept touching her hair and asking if I thought it looked stupid. I reassured her it looked amazing, but I could tell Beth's reaction had gotten to her. That's when I decided to call my mom to vent about the whole thing. Mom listened patiently while I ranted about Beth being judgmental. Then she got quiet for a moment. Honey, she said carefully, there's something you should probably know about your sister's situation. Apparently, Beth had been calling mom almost daily, crying about her twelve year old son, Tyler. He'd been getting into fights at school, his grades were dropping, and she'd found vape cartridges hidden in his backpack.

Your family canceled your invitation, but asked to keep the 50 thousand dollar deposit you paid. I said cancel the entire wedding. The call came Tuesday morning while I was editing a commercial in my home studio. This is Renee from Perfect Day Planning calling about Jared's wedding next month. Her voice sounded uncomfortable. I have some difficult news. Your family contacted us yesterday and asked us to remove you from the guest list entirely. They mentioned some family disagreements and said you wouldn't be welcome at the ceremony or reception. I paused my editing software. My family still sees me as the 29 year old college dropout who threw his life away to become a freelance videographer. What they don't know is what I actually do with all that video equipment filling my garage. However, Renee continued nervously, they also specifically requested to keep the 50 thousand dollar deposit you paid for the wedding videography pack. Missus Ruth said the family had already allocated those funds to other wedding expenses and couldn't possibly return them. I leaned back in my chair looking at the wall of awards behind me. Emmy nominations, industry recognition, contracts with Fortune 500 company. My little video hobby had quietly become a 15 million dollar production company over the past eight years. Renee, I need to ask you something important. What's the name of your wedding venue? The Riverside Manor downtown. And who owns that property? I heard papers shuffling on Her end. Um, it's listed under Sunset Holdings, LLC, right? What about your catering company? Golden Plate Catering Services. Also owned by longer pause. Sunset Holdings, LLC as well. Wait, what's going on here? The photography studio handling the wedding photos. Elite Moment Studio. Oh, my god. That's also Sunset Holdings. The florist providing all the arrangements, Bella's Garden Creations. That's. That's you, too, isn't it? The DJ company, the luxury transportation service, the rehearsal dinner venue, even the hotel block for out of town guests. All owned by Sunset Holdings, LLC. Which is my company. Renee's voice went up an octave. Mister Ruth, are you telling me that you own every single vender for this wedding? I'm telling you that for the past eight months, I've been secretly funding my brother's entire dream wedding through shell companies I created. Every vendor, every service, every single detail of this wedding, all paid for by me through different LLCs, so my family wouldn't.

I replied, okay. Within a month, they took those words back. On the morning of my 16th birthday, my parents staged what they called an independence intervention. They sat me down at the kitchen table with printed power points, slides and everything. Starting today, you're completely on your own, my mother announced, sliding a laminated card across the table that read, welcome to the real world. No more car rides to anywhere. You walk, bike, or figure it out. No more cooked meals either. The kitchen is available, but you buy and prepare your own food. No more laundry service. No more wake up calls. No more anything. We're done enabling your dependence. My father nodded sagely, adding, you'll thank us when you're thriving at 30. I studied their smug faces. Okay, I said calmly, already planning my next moves. Complete independence. They smiled, missing the careful phrasing entirely. Within 48 hours, I'd secured a job at a tech repair shop at paid surprisingly well for someone who could fix literally anything electronic. By week two, I'd negotiated a deal with my elderly neighbor, Missus Kapoor, for food. I do her grocery runs and tech support in exchange for home cooked meals. Meanwhile, the household began its slow descent into chaos. First, the Wi-Fi crashed during Dad's critical zoom presentation with Hong Kong. He stood outside my locked door for 20 minutes, pleading, just this once, buddy. It's important. But I had headphones on at dinner, he slammed his fist on the table. You knew I had that meeting. Why didn't you help me? I don't live here anymore, remember? I'm just a tenant who pays no rent. Would you fix your neighbor's W I F I? I replied, eating missus Kapoor's dumplings. Mom's phone stopped receiving emails, and I refused to fix it for her, making her miss three work deadlines. This is sabotage, she accused, cornering me in the hallway. You're being vindictive, you said. I'm on my own. That means household tech support isn't my job anymore, I said, walking past her to my paid shift. The refrigerator's water filter I'd secretly maintained for three years started dispensing gray water. Mom gagged on it during her morning coffee, then spent $400 on a can't see plumber visits before realizing it was just the filter. Why didn't you tell us? She demanded. You cut me off from family support. Why would I maintain household infrastructure for people I don't live with? The garage door opener needed reprogramming after a power outage trapping mom's car. She missed her promotion interview while waiting for the repair guy. This is your fault! She screamed through my door. You've made your point. What point? You said, I'm not your responsibility, so your house problems aren't mine. Tell! They were losing their sanity. A complete system collapse happened during their 20th anniversary party, which they'd foolishly decided to host at home. The Printer wouldn't connect to Mom's laptop. Get in here now! She shrieked from their bedroom. Sorry, I don't work here. I'm an independent adult with my own job. I called back, heading out to my shift. She handwrote 30 menus, cramping her hand so badly she needed ice. Quietly sobbing from frustration, the smart home system I'd configured started playing death metal at full volume instead of jazz. Dad frantically pressed every button on his phone while guests covered their ears. What did you do? He roared up the stairs. Nothing. I don't live here anymore. According to you, I text

My wedding reception was perfect until my mother in law, Lydia, grabbed the microphone during toast. She had already spent 10 minutes telling everyone how I trapped her precious baby boy when she turned to me in front of 200 people. You wanna know your biggest problem, sweetie? You are so fake with all that phony sweetness it makes me want to puke. Everyone stopped eating and stared at us. All that please and thank you garbage and pretending you actually care what people think when we all know you are just a manipulative little gold digger. You are going to stop lying and tell me the absolute truth about everything. I will make your life so miserable you will wish you never met my son. I looked at my horrified guests and my embarrassed husband before responding calmly into the microphone she had shoved at me. You want me to never lie and always tell you the complete truth about everything? She crossed her arms and smirked at me. That is exactly what I want. And I want it to start right now. I smiled at my new husband and then at her. Okay then. Brutal honesty. It is Thanksgiving. She made the mistake of asking why I seemed so quiet lately. Honestly, it's because I found out you told everyone at your church that I had an abortion when I have never Even been pregnant. So now 30 random strangers pray for my murdered baby every Sunday. The entire table went silent as Lydia went pale. I, I, um. He stumbled. I don't want to hear your excuses. They'll just be useless, I told her. Desperate to change the subject, she asked if everyone was enjoying her famous Turkey dinner. Of course I gave her the honesty. She demanded. No, your gravy tastes like you mixed flour or with hot dog water. And I can still hear the Turkey gobbling. Everyone stopped chewing, and I pushed my plate away. I would feed this to the dog, but I think that would be animal abuse. Later, she asked if her new dress looked nice for the family photos. You look like you got dressed in the dark, and that colour makes your skin look like raw chicken. Her face went red as I continued. Also, the way it stretched across your body really shows every single fat roll you're trying to hide. Her sister laughed so hard that she spit her wine across the table. When she asked if people were having a good time, I kept being honest. Nobody really wants to be here because your house smells like cat piss. Finally, he asked why nobody wanted to go Black Friday shopping with her this year. It's because last year you pepper sprayed a grandmother over a TV that wasn't even on sale. You also always make every 1 hold your purse while You try on clothes that are clearly three sizes too small. By Christmas, she was trying really hard to avoid asking me direct questions, but she slipped up constantly. When she asked if I like the sweater she spent two months knitting, I gave her the brutal honesty she had demanded. It looks like you learn to knit during a seizure. She started tearing up, but I didn't feel bad for her because she had asked for the truth. At dinner, she asked if we like the Christmas decorations that she had spent thousands of dollars on. No, your house looks like Christmas threw up after eating nothing but glitter and tinsel for a month. Her husband nodded in agreement. She asked if people

Gloria sorted the family photos on the mantle. She put her biological kids on the left and moved mine to the right. It's easier to keep track this way, she said, making sure I heard every word. Dad just sat there watching TV like nothing happened. I felt my face burn, but stayed quiet. Every holiday card she sent out had the same arrangement. Her real family, then my name tacked on at the end. I was 15, and those little cuts hurt more than I wanted to admit. Dad never said anything about it. When I turned 17, I heard Gloria telling her sister I would vanish after graduation. She's not interested in family history, just biding time until she can leave. I stood frozen in the hallway, feeling like I'd. And punched. But Gloria had talked for years about being adopted herself. She'd given up finding her birth mother. After decades of dead ends, that rejection still ate at her. That's when I decided to show her what real daughters actually do. I started volunteering at the senior center, teaching computers. That's where I met Ruth, who was struggling with the mouse and keyboard. She mentioned she'd given up a baby girl in 1962 at Riverside Hospital. My heart started pounding so hard, I thought Ruth would hear it. But I kept my voice steady and asked her more questions. The timeline matched. Gloria Perfectly. Gloria was getting crueler every week. She introduced me as my husband's daughter at free gathering, and I'd watch people's faces change when they realized I wasn't really hers. She made me take separate family photos so she could have some without me. At my high school awards night, she told people she was there supporting her husband while I gave my valedictorian speech. I saw other parents crying with pride while mine sat there like she was at someone else's event. Dad tried defending me once, but Gloria told him to stop being dramatic. He never tried again. I almost quit helping Ruth that week because maybe I'd never matter to Gloria. But Ruth was running out of time. Her doctor had given her maybe a year. She'd never tried finding her daughter because computers confused her and she couldn't afford help. Every Saturday for eight months, I taught her how to use DNA websites. We uploaded her information to the same site Gloria had used years before. Then we waited. Ruth got sicker each week, and I got more desperate. I'd lie awake thinking, what if this wasn't Gloria's mother? And I was. Wait. Sting. A dying woman's final months on false hope. Then the match came through. Mother and daughter with 99.8% certainty. Ruth cried so hard she couldn't breathe. But Gloria hadn't logged into the site for five years. Ruth begged me not to tell Gloria because rejection would kill her faster than the cancer. Gloria's 60th birthday was in three weeks. Though dad was throwing a party with 40 relatives coming, this was Ruth's only chance. I promised I'd bring her myself. The morning of Gloria's birthday, Ruth could barely walk. I practically carried her from my car while my hands shook. At the party, Gloria was lecturing everyone about how family bonds come from blood, not paperwork. I felt sick hearing it, knowing it was an other dig at me. That's when Ruth shuffled into our backyard. I'm looking for Gloria Marie, born March 15th, 1962, Ruth said, her voice barely audible. Gloria turned around, looking annoyed at the interruption. That's me, but you're at the wrong party. Ruth didn't say anything. She just pulled out her phone with trembling hands and showed the screen to Gloria. I held my breath. The yard went completely silent. Gloria stared at the screen showing the maternal match. Her face went white. This is fake, Gloria said, but her voice cracked.

My mother weaponized disappointment like other parents used praise. She'd sigh when introducing me to friends, hang up on me mid sentence if I wasn't saying something impressive enough, and her house was filled with photos of my perfect cousin Sarah, who she always compared me to. Even her compliments came wrapped in poison. You look pretty today, which is rare. She started early when I brought home a report card with straight A's and 1 B+, drove to school, and demanded they remove me from honors classes because obviously I couldn't handle the pressure. The month after that, I won second place at the science fair, and she told the winner's mother, loud enough for everyone to hear, that my daughter probably cheated and still couldn't win. How disappointing. I got into my dream college. She called admissions and tried to decline my acceptance because state school would be more appropriate for someone of your abilities. She didn't even leave my boyfriend out of it, announcing at family dinner that he was doing charity work by dating down. When I bought my first house, she posted on Facebook that I'd finally found a place that matches my low standards, with photos highlighting every flaw. If I even confronted her about any of this, call other relatives immediately. I'm worried about her mental health. She keeps imagining I Said terrible things when all I've ever done is support her. Maybe she needs some professional help. The breaking point came last winter when my appendix burst and I was rushed into emergency surgery. I called my mother while terrified and in pain, begging her to come give me some assurance. She sighed at my voice and said, I won't come. Do you even realize how disappointed I am that my only child can't even stay healthy? Sarah's mother never has to deal with hospital visits. She hung up before I could respond. While nurses prepped me for surgery, I checked Facebook one last time. My mom had posted 10 minutes after our call. Some days I wish I could just start over with a child who doesn't constantly disappoint me. It's like I might as well not have one at all. My own friends were texting me screenshots, horrified that my mother would write this while I was being wheeled into surgery. That when something inside me snapped into place, she wanted to act like she didn't have a child so I'd give her exactly what she asked for. I decided to lean into her declaration. If she wished she didn't have a child, then I'd honor that wish. I started simple. Changed my voicemail to a memorial message. You've reached the memorial line for Helen's daughter. Please leave condolences after the tone. Then I had funeral flowers delivered to her house, laying the foundation perfectly. Mom called me 37 times that day I didn't answer. Next, I sent sympathy cards to all our relatives, thinking of you during this difficult time of loss. They read. I signed them, A friend who cares. Whenever I ran into her church friends at the grocery store, I'd mention casually that I was planning a memorial service. Since mom declared she might as well not have a child, I figured I should honor her wishes. I'd say with a sad smile, it's what she wanted. Words spread fast through her social circles. People started asking mom about the service. She tried explaining I wasn't actually dead, but that made her look even worse. So you said you don't have a child, but you do? They'd ask. That's really messed up, Helen. The masterpiece came together when I scheduled my memorial for the same day as her charity club.

But my daughter did something that made him turn pale. It was Thanksgiving at his parents house and I should have known better than to show up with store bought dinner rolls. For eight years of marriage to Derek, I had Learned that everything had to be perfect in front of his family or there would be consequences later. But I had been pulling 12 hour shifts at the hospital all week and barely had time to shower, let alone bake homemade bread. His mother, Patricia, made the first comment. As I set the plastic container on her perfectly set dining table, she lifted one roll with her manicured fingers like it might contaminate her entire meal. Well, she said, loud enough for the entire room to hear, I suppose not everyone has time for family traditions anymore. Twenty two family members were crammed into that dining room. His parents, both brothers with their wives, six kids ranging from toddlers to teenagers, and various aunts and uncles who had driven in from neighboring towns. All of them turned to stare at me like I had committed some unforgivable sin. I forced a smile and explained that I had been working overtime at the hospital. Three nurses had called in sick with the flu, and someone had to cover the emergency department. I thought they would understand. His father was a retired police officer. His brothers worked construction. They knew about demanding jobs. But Derek's face was already turning that familiar shade of red that meant trouble was coming. His jaw clenched the way it always did when he thought I had embarrassed him. The vein in his temple started throbbing. You always have an excuse, he said loudly enough to cut through every conversation in the room. The football game on TV suddenly seemed too loud. Someone's fork clinked against their plate. One of the toddlers asked for more juice, but nobody moved to help him. All eyes were on us. Now. I'm not making excuses, I said as calmly as I could manage. I'm explaining why I didn't have time to bake this week. That's when he hit me. The slap echoed through the dining room like a gunshot. My cheek exploded in pain, and I could taste blood where my teeth had cut the inside of my lip. The force of it knocked me sideways, and I had to grab the back of a chair to keep from falling. Complete silence fell over the room. Not one person moved. Not one person spoke. His father stared at his plate like it held the secrets of the universe. His mother suddenly developed an intense interest in folding and refolding her napkin. His brothers exchanged a quick glance, but immediately looked away. Even the children had gone completely quiet. Don't you ever embarrass me like that again! Derek hissed through clenched teeth. That's When my sixteen year old daughter Chloe stood up from the kids table in the corner, she had been living with us for two years since her father died in a motorcycle accident.

I thought I knew everything about my husband Sergio after 12 years of marriage. Turns out I didn't know the most important thing. We were at the oral surgeon's office getting his wisdom teeth removed, all four at once. Because Sergio always like to get things over with quickly. I sat in the waiting room scrolling through my phone and thinking about what soft foods to pick pick up on the way home. Just another Tuesday afternoon in our normal suburban life. The nurse called me back after about an hour. Sergio was in recovery, still pretty looped from the laughing gas and whatever else they'd given him. His cheeks were stuffed with gauze and his eyes were glassy. But he was awake and mumbling something I couldn't understand. He's doing great, the nurse said. Just needs a few more minutes before you can take him home. I sat next to him and took his hand. That's when things got weird. Instead of squeezing my hand back like he always did, Sergio pulled away and started looking around the room frantically. Where's Nathan, he slurred through the gauze. I need Nathan. Nathan was his best friend since college. They worked at this I'm accounting firm and play basketball together every Saturday. I figured the drugs were just making him confused. Nathan's at work, honey, I'm here. It's me, Sonia. But Sergio kept shaking his head and trying to sit up. The nurse had to hold him down. No, no, no. Need to tell Nathan. Need to tell him about that night. What night? I asked even. No, he probably wouldn't remember any of this later. Our wedding night. His words were getting clearer as he got more agitated. I left the reception, told you I was checking on the hotel room. But I went to Nathan, had to see Nathan. My stomach started feeling weird, but I told myself it was just random drug talk. People say all kinds of nonsense when they're high. The nurse gave me a look like she'd seen this before, patients revealing secrets they never tell sober. Sergio kept going. And when Joyce was born, you were sleeping. And I snuck out to the parking lot. Nathan was waiting in his car. I needed him there. Always need him there. Joyce was our daughter. She was 8 now and the light of both our lives. Why was Sergio talking about Nathan during her birth? My hands were starting to shake. First anniversary dinner, told you I got called into work, but I didn't. Went to Nathan's apartment. We watched our movie. We always watch our movie on important days. The nurse quietly excused herself, probably sensing this was getting too personal. Sergio reached for my hand again, but this time his touch felt different. Foreign. Love Nathan so much. Love him more than anything, but love Sonia, too. Love them both. Why can't I love Them both. The drugs were wearing off enough that tears were rolling down his face, mixing with a drool from his numb mouth. I sat there frozen, trying to process what I was hearing. My husband of 12 years, the father of my child, the man I built my whole life around. How long, I whispered, even though I wasn't sure I wanted to know. Forever since junior year, before I even met you.

Emma had been best friends with Zoe since second grade. They did everything together, walked to school, ate lunch at the same table, had sleepovers every weekend. My daughter would come home with stories about their inside jokes and secret handshakes. They were inseparable. But everything changed when Zoe got an iPhone 15 for her 13th birthday. Suddenly, Emma wasn't getting invited to hang out anymore. At lunch, Zoe would sit with the girls who had fancy phones, showing off her new camera and playing games Emma couldn't join because she only had my old flip phone. I came home in tears three days straight, Mom, Zoe won't even look at me. I'm boring now because I can't text her or be in the group chat. It broke my heart watching my confident daughter shrink into herself. I worked two jobs just to keep us afloat after the divorce. There was no way I could afford a 600 dollar phone for a 13 year old. But seeing Emma's face every day, knowing she was eating lunch alone while her former best friend posted Instagram stories with new friends made me desperate. That's when I remembered something my grandmother taught me about friendship. She used to say real friends don't need expensive things to connect. They need shared experiences and genuine care for Each other. I had an idea. Instead of trying to compete with technology, I would give Emma something Zoe's iPhone couldn't, real adventure. I started planning surprise activities for Emma and whoever wanted to join. Many road trips to the beach, camping in our backyard, teaching her to bake my grandmother's secret cookie recipe. The first weekend, only Emma and I went hiking. But she seemed happier than she'd been in weeks, taking photos with my old digital camera and collecting pretty rocks. She posted one blurry photo on her rarely used social media with the caption, adventures with mom. Monday at school, three different girls asked Emma about her weekend. Turns out, while everyone else was stuck inside on their phones, Emma had stories to tell, real stories about getting lost on the trail and finding a hidden waterfall. Within two weeks, Emma had new friends asking to join our weekend adventures. Girls who were tired of just staring at screens wanted to come camping, learn to bake, go on photo walks around town. The turning point came during our third weekend camping trip. We had four girls with us roasting marshmallows.

It was my best friend. You need to see this before tomorrow or everything changes. I'm like, what the hell, Maya? What's so urgent that can't wait? She goes, no, seriously, get over here now. Trust me, you need to see this. So I'm walking to her apartment thinking someone died or something. The whole way there, I'm trying to figure out what could be so bad that she can't just tell me over text. Maya's not dramatic usually, so this has to be serious. She opens the door and immediately goes, sit down. She looks genuinely upset, which is freaking me out even more. She's got her laptop out on the kitchen table and she's just staring at, at me. Promise me you won't freak out. Now I'm really panicked. I'm thinking maybe someone posted revenge of me or something eaily horrible. She turns the screen and shows me Adrian's Instagram. There's a post from 3 hours ago of him at some restaurant holding hands with this girl across the table. The caption says, 2 years together and still feels like the honeymoon phase. Staring at it confused because we've been together for two years, like what are the odds it's just a coincidence? Then I look closer at the girl and my stomach drops. It's my coworker, Lila. The same Lila who sits two cubicles away from me. The same Lila who's been weird around me lately, always asking about My schedule if Adrian and I are happy, what we did last weekend. Random stuff that seemed innocent at the time. Maya goes there's more and scrolls down to the comments. Adrian's mom commented, so happy for you both with heart emojis. His sister wrote about time you made it official. His college room mate wrote, finally introducing us to the real one. The real one. Like I'm some fake placeholder girlfriend. I'm just sitting there like what the actual f. Everyone in his family knows about this girl and I had no clue. How long has this been going on? That's when Maya shows me Lila's Instagram. She's got posts going back months. Her and Adrian at concerts I thought he was going to with his guy friends. I'm at the beach house his family rents every summer that he told me was family only this year. There's even a photo of them at his cousin's graduation party in may, the same party he told me I couldn't come to because it was just close family. I scroll through more of her posts and see Adrian's friends commenting on everything. People I've met multiple times who apparently know about Lila but never said anything to me. The worst part is I work with this girl every single day. We eat lunch together in the break room. I've been telling her about my relationship problems with.

I stared at her, waiting for some explanation, some context that would make those words make sense. But she just closed her eyes with this peaceful expression, like she'd finally gotten something off her chest. An hour later, she was gone. The funeral was small. My mother didn't have many friends, and I was her only family. Or so I thought. People kept telling me how sorry they were for my loss, how she was such a devoted mother, how proud she must have been of me. I just nodded and smiled. But her last words kept echoing in my head. For three weeks, I couldn't function. I'd wake up at 3:00am replaying that moment. What did she mean? Was I adopted? Did she have an affair? Was there some family secret she took to her grave? My coworkers started asking if I was okay. I'd zone out during meetings, stare at my computer screen for hours without typing a word. My girlfriend Sarah kept suggesting therapy. But how do you explain to a therapist that your dying mother basically told you that you weren't her real kid? I started going through old family photos, looking for clues. Every single picture, my mother looked distant. Even in photos from my childhood birthdays, she had this forced smile, like she was performing the role of a happy mother rather than actually being one. Then I remembered how she used To disappear. Every year on my birthday, she'd make me breakfast, give me presents, sing Happy Birthday. But then around noon, she'd always say she had errands to run. She'd be gone for hours, coming back quiet and sad. I always thought she was visiting my father's grave. But now I wondered. Then I found her old address book. There were names and numbers I didn't recognize, including one entry that just said D. Important dates with a phone number. No last name, no address. Just D. That's when I decided I had to go through everything in her house systematically. I've been putting it off, but I needed answers. I started in her bedroom, going through drawers, closets, boxes, under the bed. Most of it was normal stuff. Old bills, jewelry, clothes that still smelled like her perfume. But then, in the very back of her closet, behind winter coat she never wore, I found a small metal lock box. It was heavy, and when I shook it, I could hear paper shuffling inside. The key was taped underneath her jewelry box. She always hid things in the most obvious places. My hands were shaking as I opened it. Inside were birth certificates. Mine yellowed with age. And another one with the exact same date. Same hospital, same time of birth, but a different name. David Michael Thompson. The mother's name was the same. Margaret Thompson. My mother. I had a twin brother. That wasn't all. There were letters. Dozens of them, written in my mother's handwriting. Birthday cards, Christmas cards, graduation cards, all addressed to my dearest David.

My 14 year old son thinks he's a master of deception, but he has no idea I know about his secret YouTube channel. I discovered it by accident when I was cleaning his room and found a crumpled receipt for a 300 dollar microphone. First I was furious. We just had a talk about responsible spending. But before confronting him, I decided to do some digging. That night after he went to bed, I searched his browser history. There it was, a gaming channel with 50,000 subscribers. My quiet, introverted son who barely I spoke at family dinners was absolutely electric on camera, cracking jokes and entertaining thousands. Instead of shutting it down, I decided to play dumb and secretly support him. Every time he went to study at the library, I knew he was actually recording videos in our basement. I'd intentionally make extra noise upstairs so he'd have to re record, teaching him patience. He complained about background noise ruining his takes. I suggested soundproofing his room for better concentration while studying. He started asking for odd things, green poster board, ring lights, a better webcam. Each time I'd make him present a detailed plan for how these school supplies would improve his grades. His presentations got increasingly elaborate. He even made a Powerpoint about how better lighting would help him read text books more clearly. The best part, every time he uploaded a new video, I'd watch It immediately, my son would sit at dinner casually mentioning how hard his homework was while I knew he just spent three hours trying to beat the final boss in Elden Ring. He got creative with his excuses. Once he told us he needed to join the debate club to improve his public speaking. In reality, he was practicing his commentary skills. When he won most improved speaker at school, I had to bite my tongue. His hundreds of hours of gaming commentary had given him more confidence than any debate club could. One day he mentioned needing a new chair because his back hurt from studying. I knew the real reason. He just hit 100,000 subscribers and was streaming longer. I bought him a gaming chair but labeled it an ergonomic study.

You can figure it out. She shrugged. I stood there watching her walk away with her perfect little blended family, dragging their matching designer suitcases toward the gate. She didn't even look back. Not once. I had $23 in my pocket, a dead phone charger, and absolutely nowhere to go in this massive airport. That's when I remembered the business card tucked in my wallet. The one with the fancy logo I've been carrying around for three years. My Aunt Sarah's restaurant card. The sister my mom had been bad mouthing my entire life, calling her a jealous failure. Sarah's a pathetic loser, mom always said. She's jealous of our success and stability. Don't believe anything she tells you about our family. But standing there alone in JFK Terminal 4, watching families rush past me with their vacation excitement, I figured I had nothing left to lose. I found a payphone. Yes, they still exist in airports. And dialed the number with shaking fingers. It rang twice before a warm, professional voice answered. Bella Vista Restaurant. This is Sarah speaking. Aunt Sarah, it's Maya. I'm. I'm in really big trouble right now. The silence lasted forever. Then, in a completely different tone. Baby girl? Maya, where are you? Are you safe? What happened? I started crying. Right there in the middle of the busy Terminal. Mom left me at the airport. She took her new husband and his kids on vacation to Hawaii and just abandoned me here. What terminal are you at? I'm coming to get you right now. You don't understand. I'm at JFK in New York. You're all the way in Chicago. I can't ask you to. Maya, Honey, listen to me carefully. I have three successful restaurants now. I'm not the broke failure your mother told you I was. Exactly where you are. I'm getting on the next available flight. Four hours later, I watched a confident woman in designer jeans and a cashmere coat rush through the arrivals gate, scanning the crowd frantically. She looked exactly like mom, but her eyes were kind instead of cold. When she spotted me, she started running. I've been waiting 10 years for this phone call, she whispered, hugging me so tight I could barely breathe. I've tried reaching you so many times, but your mother blocked every single attempt. To ride to her luxury hotel suite was completely surreal. Sarah explained everything while ordering room service. How she built a successful restaurant empire from nothing. How she been sending birthday cards and Christmas gifts that mom apparently threw away unopened. How she'd even hired a family lawyer once to try for visitation rights. Your mother told everyone in our family that I was a drug addict who couldn't hold a job. Sarah laughed bitterly. Meanwhile, I've been featured in Chicago magazine as entrepreneur Of the year, two years running. That night in the hotel, Sarah showed me years worth of returned letters with refused stamps, photos of elaborate birthday cake she'd made for me each year, and bank statements proving she'd

When I started, it was a struggling family restaurant with two star reviews and empty tables. I transformed everything, rebuilt the menu, trained the staff, sourced local ingredients. Within a year, we were booked solid with a waiting list. But when old Mister Romano died last spring, everything changed. His son Giovanni inherited the place and he had different ideas. Cut costs, use frozen ingredients, fire half the kitchen staff. People can't tell the difference anyway, he'd say. Counting receipts while I fought to maintain the standards that built our reputation. I refuse to compromise our lamb. Also buco was legendary. Our house made pasta brought people from three states over. I wasn't about to ruin that for Giovanni's, the margins. So on my 32nd birthday, after our biggest week ever, he called me into the cramped office above the dining room. Birthday balloons from the staff still hung in the kitchen below. Here's my surprise for you, he said with this smug grin. You're fired effective immediately. You're too difficult to work with. I stood there, soft stained apron still tied around my waist, watching him lean back in his father's old chair like he just Solved world hunger. I didn't argue, didn't cry, just untied my apron, set it on his desk and walked out past the confused prep cooks who'd worked under me for years. The drive home felt endless. Three years of my life gone. My reputation, my team, my recipes all handed over to someone who thought ketchup was a vegetable. My husband, Scott was waiting in our kitchen with a bottle of wine and that knowing smile he gets when he's up to something. How did the birth a shift go, he asked. Already pouring two glasses. Terrible. Giovanni fired me. His grin widened. Perfect timing. What do you mean perfect timing? I just lost my job. We have a mortgage, Scott bills. He pulled out his laptop, fingers dancing across the key board. Remember that food critic from the times who came in last month, Julia Chen, the one who wrote that amazing review about your lamb dish? Yeah, of course. She said it was transcendent. Why? Well, Scott said, turning the screen toward me, she's been discreetly asking around town about hiring a private chef for her daughter's wedding next weekend. Very exclusive, very high paying. I may have already told her you'd be available. I stared at the email thread. Julia had been trying to reach me for weeks, but Giovanni never passed along messages. She was offering $15,000 for a single event, more than I made in three months at Romano's. Scott, how did you my phone Buzz text message, then another. Then it started ringing. Giovanni's number flashed on the screen. I let it go to voicemail. Then more calls. The assistant manager, the sous chef, even the dishwasher. By the time I checked, there were 47 missed calls. And count. Scott was refreshing his laptop cackling, oh, this is beautiful. Look, a skating review had just gone live on every major food blog and review site, posted an hour ago, right around when Giovanni would have been running dinner service without me. Romano's Restaurant, a spectacular fall from Grace, read the headline. The review was brutal. Food quality has completely.

I wasn't about to ruin that for Giovanni's margins. So on my 32nd birthday, after our biggest week ever, he called me into the cramped office above the dining room. Birthday balloons from the staff still hung in the kitchen below. Here's my surprise for you, he said with this smug grin. You're fired, effective immediately. You're too difficult to work with. I stood there, soft stained apron still tied around my waist, watching him lean back in his father's old chair like he just solved World hunger. I didn't argue, didn't cry. Just untied my apron, set it on his desk, and walked out past the confused prep cooks who'd worked under me for years. The drive home felt endless. Three years of my life gone. My reputation, my team, my recipes, all handed over to someone who thought ketchup was a vegetable. My husband, Scott, was waiting in our kitchen with a bottle of wine and that knowing smile he gets when he's up to something. How did the birth shift go? He asked, already pouring two glasses. Terrible. Giovanni fired me. His grin widened. Perfect timing. What do you mean, perfect timing? I just lost my job. We have a mortgage, Scott. Bills. He pulled out his laptop, fingers dancing across the key board. Remember that food critic from the times who came in last month? Julia Chen? The one who wrote that amazing review about your lamb dish? Yeah, of course. She said it was transcendent. Why? Well, Scott said, turning the screen toward me, she's been discreetly asking around town about hiring a private chef for her daughter's wedding next weekend. Very exclusive, very high paying. I may have already told her you'd be available. I stared at the email thread. Julia had been trying to reach me for weeks, but Giovanni never passed along messages. She was offering $15,000 for a single event. More than I made in three months at Romano's. Scott, how did you. My phone buzzed. Text Message, then another. Then it started ringing. Giovanni's number flashed on the screen. I let it go to voicemail. Then more calls. The assistant manager, the sous chef, even the dishwasher. By the time I checked, there were 47 missed calls. And count Scott was refreshing his laptop, tackling. Oh, this is beautiful. Look, A skating review had just gone live on every major food blog and review site. Posted an hour ago, right around when Giovanni would have been running dinner service without me. Romano's Restaurant, a spectacular fall from Grace. Read the headline. The review was brutal.

You can figure it out. She shrugged. I stood there watching her walk away with her perfect little blended family, dragging their matching designer suitcases toward the gate. She didn't even look back, not once. I had $23 in my pocket, a dead phone charger and absolutely nowhere to go in this massive airport. That's when I remembered the business card tucked in my wallet, the one with the fancy logo I've been carrying around for three years. My Aunt Sarah's restaurant card. The sister my mom had been bad mouthing my entire life, calling her a jealous failure. Sarah's a pathetic loser. Mom always said she's jealous of our success and stability. Don't believe anything she tells you about our family. But standing there alone in JFK Terminal 4, watching families rush past me with their vacation excitement, I figured I had nothing left to lose. I found a payphone. Yes, they still exist in airports, and dialed the number with shaking fingers. It rang twice before a warm, professional voice answered. Bella Vista Restaurant. This is Sarah speaking. And Sarah, it's Maya. I'm. I'm in really big trouble right now. The silence lasted forever. Then in a completely different tone. Baby girl, Maya, where are you? Are you safe? What happened? I started crying right there in the middle of the busy Terminal. Mom left me at the airport. She took her new husband and his kids on vacation to Hawaii and just abandoned me here. What terminal are you at? I'm coming to get you right now. You don't understand. I'm at JFK in New York. You're all the way in Chicago. I can't ask you to Maya. Honey, listen to me carefully. I have three successful restaurants now. I'm not the broke failure your mother told you I was. Say exactly where you are. I'm getting on the next available flight. Four hours later, I watched a confident woman in designer jeans and a cashmere coat rush through the arrivals gate, scanning the crowd frantically. She looked exactly like mom, but her eyes were kind instead of cold. When she spotted me, she started running. I've been waiting 10 years for the phone call, she whispered, hugging me so tight I could barely breathe. I've tried reaching you so many times, but your mother blocked every single attempt. To ride to her luxury hotel suite was completely surreal. Sarah explained everything while ordering room service, how she built a successful restaurant empire from nothing, how she been sending birthday cards and Christmas gifts that mom apparently threw away unopened, how she'd even hired a family lawyer once to try for visitation rights. Your mother told everyone in our family that I was a drug addict who couldn't hold a job. Sarah laughed bitterly. Meanwhile, I've been featured in Chicago magazine as Entrepreneur of the year, two years running. That night in the hotel, Sarah showed me years worth of returned letters with refused stamps, photos of elaborate birthday cake she'd made for me each year, and bank statements proving she'd.

That was my reality. By 17, they claimed I owed them $300,000 in joy debt. They had color coded spreadsheets packing every smile, every laugh, every moment of happiness I'd stolen from them. Since I could walk, I Learned to keep my face blank, stone cold nothing. They said I was stealing their peace by being happy. So they'd actually Bill other families when I smiled around their kids $25 for infectious Joy contamination. They call my childhood became a financial transaction. Giggling at a cartoon, that's $15. Smiling at a dog, another $5. They had categories for everything. Spontaneous laughter was $20, but if they deemed it excessive, it jumped to $40. Birthday parties were banned because they called them joy festivals that would bankrupt me. I ate lunch alone in bathroom stalls because sitting with friends meant potential joy charges if someone told a joke. I slept on the floor in my room because my mattress was collateral for unpaid happiness debts. They pulled me from art class, music class, any elective that might spark joy because college isn't for debtors anyway. The worst part, they made me sign contracts, actual legal looking documents, promising to pay them back with interest once I turned 18. They'd already picked out my future jobs, three minimum wage positions to maximize debt repayment speed. They even calculated compound interest Rates and projected pay off dates through 2055. My neighbors knew about the system. Some thought they were genius parents who'd solve the spoiled child problem. Others would cross the street when they saw me coming, afraid of being charged for any accidental happiness I might display. The mailman started avoiding eye contact after they build him $30 for making me smile with his dog videos. They had a special punishment room in the basement where I'd sit for hours reciting my debt total. The walls were covered with financial charts showing exactly how much my emotions had cost them over the years. They'd invite relatives over just to show off their innovative parenting system and watch me demonstrate my perfect emotional control. But they made one huge mistake that changed everything. During a meeting to officially withdraw me from school, they brought their ledgers, all of them 13 years worth of documentation. They were so incredibly proud of their innovative parenting system

I said, fair enough, and quietly canceled our 85,000 dollar wedding. Her face went pale when she got the cancellation notice. I'm watching my ex fiance Bianca blow up my phone right now. She just found out I canceled our entire wedding that was supposed to happen in 4 months. See, I own a tech consulting firm that's done pretty well. Not yacht money, but comfortable. She's an influencer making maybe 30 k a year. When we got engaged last year after dating for 3 years, she immediately went into wedding planning overdrive. Not just any wedding. Her dream wedding. Historic 8 venue for $15,000, catering for 250 guests at $30,000, flowers for $8,000, photographer and videographer for $10,000. Her dress for $12,000, band for $6,000. The list kept going. Total damage $85,000. I was fine with it initially. I loved her, wanted her happy, had the money saved. But then my lawyer friend Garrett pulled me aside at a barbecue. Yo, you getting a prenup? Haven't thought about it. Dude, you own a business. You need one. If she's cool, no harm done. So I brought it up that night casually. Hey, Garrett mentioned we should probably do a prenup. Standard stuff for business owners. The temperature in the room dropped in. You think I'm a gold digger? Bianca snapped. No, it's just standard legal Protection. If you loved me, you'd trust me. I do trust you. This Is just. I'll sign a prenup when hell freezes over. Bianca, be reasonable. You be reasonable. We're supposed to be partners. What's yours is ours, but what's mine is. Well, you know, I don't have money like you. Don't be ridiculous. God, why are you being so cheap? She stormed off. I figured she needed time to cool down. Nope. Next day, she told her whole family I was financially abusing her by asking for a prenup. Her mom Deedee, called, screaming, how dare you insult my daughter like this? I asked for a standard prenup. That's not an insult. She's giving you the best years of her life. She's 28, not 80. And I'm giving her mine, too. A real man doesn't need contracts with his wife. Click. She hung up on me. Bianca came back that evening, acting like nothing happened. Started showing me centerpiece options. We need to resolve the prenup thing first. I said there's nothing to resolve. I'm not signing it now. Roses or peonies? Bianca, I'm serious. So am I. Drop it or there won't be a wedding. Okay, good. So, peonies? Sure. Whatever you want.

We all knew Holly would let the world burn if it meant keeping girls safe. She literally treated female friendship like a sacred religion. She'd walk wasted girls home from parties, share her last tampon with girls she'd never met, and somehow knew which guys to avoid before anyone else did. Every girl had her number saved for emergencies because they could all count on her to fix things. There was this one time at lunch when the football players were ranking girls by their bodies out loud. Holly walked right up to their table, took photos of all of them, and announced she post them on the school's parent Facebook age with exactly what they've been saying unless they apologize to every single girl individually. That was Holly's whole identity. She lived for female solidarity. She'd stay up all night talking girls through breakups, pretend to be someone's girlfriend to get creeps to back off, fight with teachers who dress coded girls unfairly. During junior year, when the cheerleaders started that toxic diet competition, Holly brought homemade cookies every day until they stopped weighing themselves. The girls would cry on her shoulder, trust her with their darkest secrets, and she treat protecting them like her life's purpose. Then winter break passed, and Holly showed up wearing headphones, staring at her phone, completely ignoring the circle of girls who'd been waiting to tell her their break Drama when Neva ran up crying about her boyfriend cheating, Holly literally stopped around her and kept walking. She didn't hold the door for the freshman girl carrying too many books. Didn't smile back at anyone. During lunch, Amira was sobbing about her parents'divorce, and Holly would have normally dropped everything to comfort her, but she sat alone the entire time. The worst part was when Sienna fainted in the hallway from not eating. Old Holly would have been the first one there. This. Holly glanced over, watch the nurse handle it, and went back to her homework. Girls kept approaching her all day. Summer needed a tampon. Holly shrugged and said she didn't have one. Freya asked for a ride home because she felt unsafe. Holly said, call Uber without looking up. We all thought she was going through something heavy, maybe seasonal depression, maybe family problems. Some girls organized an intervention. They cornered her after school with flowers and her favorite coffee. Hallie took one look at them and said, I'm not interested. Just that. Then walked to her car. Days turned into weeks. The girls went from concerned to desperate. They made a schedule to check on her, left notes in her locker, even got the counselor involved. Hallie told the counselor she was focusing on herself and there was nothing wrong. When that didn't work, they told one of our teachers. She asked Hallie why she wasn't helping organize the Women's Empowerment Orman Assembly. Halle responded, That's not my responsibility anymore. Then we all found out what happened. During a massive New Year's Eve party at Wyatt's house. Halle had gone with her closest friends, prepared to be designated driver and protect anyone. But then someone spiked her drink, and she started feeling really sick and disoriented. She'd managed to lock herself in an upstairs bathroom when she realized something was seriously wrong. Holly had texted the group chat with her friends, the ones she called her soul sisters. She typed, please help. Something's wrong. I think someone put something in my drink. I'm scared. I locked myself in Wyatt's bathroom. Please come get me now. Then another. I can't stand up properly. Please hurry, then.

So I'm 23, oldest of five kids, and basically running my parents house like I'm the damn manager or something. I'm in school full time getting my second degree, plus I work part time in my field. My employer already said they'll take me full time once I graduate, so I'm making decent money for a student. Enough to pay for school and actually save some cash. My siblings are 20, 17, 14, and 10. My parents both work. Dad pulls crazy long hours and mom does the 9 to 5 grind at some stressful job. So guess who picks up all the slack? Me. I do literally everything. Grocery shopping every week, all the laundry for seven people, cooking dinner every single night, and meal prep on Sunday so everyone has lunches ready. I even manage my siblings chores like making sure there's dog food in the pantry so my youngest brother can actually feed our two dogs. Or that we have poop bags on the leashes. It's like being a mom to four other people. Plus going to school during Christmas break. I finally had enough saved up to buy myself a PS five. Been wanting one forever and I found one at regular price. But if you know anything about PS Fives in 2022 was basically winning the lottery. The rest of my family still shares this old PS four in the living room, but I Keep mine in my room. It's mine, I bought it. And no, I don't share it. Well, my 20 year old brother Jake started whining to my parents about how unfair it was that I had all this money and cool stuff but wouldn't share. Like, dude, get a job, but whatever. So my parents call me into the kitchen for this family meeting, which was basically them telling me I need to start paying rent. They said it wasn't fair that I was making good money while living there for free. Especially when I won't even share my gaming console. I just sat there listening to them explain how much they wanted from me monthly. And I'm doing the math in my head. After rent, I'd have maybe $800 left over each month. That's after buying my own food, gas, school supplies, everything. I went to my room and actually calculated it out on paper. If I dropped a couple classes next semester, I could go almost full time at work. It would only add one more year to my degree, but I could afford my own place. And here's the kicker. I'd actually have more free time and way more spending money than if I stayed home paying rent while doing everyone's chores. So I packed up my stuff. Everything I owned fit in my Honda Civic, which honestly was kind of depressing, but also liberating. I didn't tell them I was leaving until I was loading my Car, where are you going? My mom asked, standing in the driveway in her bathrobe. Getting my own place. Thanks for helping me realize I can afford it. I stayed at this Airbnb for two weeks while I figured out apartments, adjusted my class schedule, and got more hours at work. The Airbnb host, this older lady named Beverly, kept asking if I was okay because I was just so happy to be there. Like, I was literally excited to do my own laundry. And. Okay, I'm not gonna lie. I went a little crazy on dating apps. Living at home with 4 siblings and strict parents meant I hadn't had any.

I jerked upright in bed, heart pounding against my ribs. What are you talking about? I don't do that. He held up his phone screen, glowing in the darkness of our bedroom. I have it on video, Julia. Every single night I watched myself on the hallway camera footage, standing perfectly still at our six year old daughter's door. Two kitchen knives clutched in my hands, one in each fist. The time stamp read 12:03 a m. That's not possible, I whispered. But there I was, motionless for hours. According to the fast forward layback, miles scrolled through multiple recordings from the past week. Same position, same knives, same bacon expression on my face. I had absolutely no memory of any of it. How long has this been happening? I asked, my voice cracking. Miles pulled up the footage history on his phone. I installed the camera a month ago when Mary mentioned hearing footsteps. Thought maybe she was sleepwalking. He showed me night after night of recordings. You stand there from midnight until almost 4:00am. Then you just walk back to bed. We reviewed more footage together. Sitting at the kitchen table with his laptop, I appeared at eleven fifty eight PM in every video. Retrieved the knives from the kitchen drawer and took my position like clockwork. Miles had dark circles under his eyes. I hadn't noticed. Before, I didn't want to scare you, but this isn't normal. Julia. We need to get you help. Have you asked Mary about this? I managed to ask. He nodded slowly. She says she hears tapping on her window sometimes. I checked outside, but never found anything. My blood turned cold. Tapping on her window. I instinctively stood up and walked to the knife drawer, pulling it open. The two largest knives were at the front, handles facing out. Had I arranged them that way? That night, I forced myself to stay awake. Miles set up his phone to record me, and I sat on the couch drinking coffee. At 11:45 p m, a strange heaviness washed over me. I fought against it, digging my nails into my palms. The I hit 11:00am and everything went black. I woke up at 407:00am, standing in our bedroom, miles staring at me with wide eyes. You just stood there again. I tried to talk to you, even shook you, but you were completely gone. He showed me the new footage. I looked like a statue. Unblinking, unmoving. Except for the subtle rise and fall of my chest. The next morning, I examined Mary's window from outside. Small scratches marked the frame, concentrated around the lock. Fresh marks overlapped older ones. My hands trembled as I took photos. Miles called the police while I questioned Mary. Tell me about the tapping sounds, sweetheart. She looked up from her coloring book. They stopped. A While ago. Now I just hear you walking around outside my door. Officer McCoy arrived within the hour and exam in the window. These are tool marks. Probably from someone trying to Jimmy the lock. She photographed everything meticulously. Has anyone been watching your house? Any strange vehicles? We couldn't think of anything unusual. She recommended motion sensors for the backyard and extra locks on Mary's window. Miles installed cameras outside that afternoon. If someone's been trying to get in, we'll catch them. That night, he stayed awake to monitor all the feeds while I inevitably blacked out. He kissed my forehead at 11:45 p m. Maybe your subconscious knows something we don't. At 12:47 a m, according to Miles's frantic retelling the next morning, a figure appeared at Mary's window. Dark clothing, face obscured by a hood. It produced a thin metal tool and worked at the lock while I stood guard inside. Knives ready. The figure tried for 20 minutes before giving up and disappearing into the shadows. Miles had called 9 1 1 immediately, but the intruder vanished before police arrived. Officer McCoy reviewed the footage with us. The build looks familiar. Height about 5 feet, 10 inches. The way they moved. She paused the video. Do you recognize anything? That's when it clicked. Light hunch of the shoulders. The way they favored their left hand. Oh, my god. That's Isaac, our babysitter's boyfriend. The police moved fast. They arrested Isaac that morning at our babysitter's apartment. The search warrant revealed the worst possible outcome his lap

You get nothing when we die. Then Grandma's lawyer called. The call came while I was eating cereal before my shift at the auto parts store. Austin called. Well, this is Margaret Stevens, state attorney. Your grandmother, Eleanor, left you something. I almost laughed. There's been a mistake. My parents said I wasn't in her will. Mr Caldwell, we need to meet immediately. Two hours later, I'm staring at documents, $2.1 million a house, investment accounts all mine. But I'm adopted, I stammered. Margaret handed me a letter in Grandma's handwriting. Austin, you are not adopted. You're my biological grandson. Your father's first wife, Jennifer, was your real mother. She died when you were 2. Susan made David pretend you were adopted because she wanted you gone. My hand shook. 21 years of being treated like garbage while my siblings got cars and vacations. I work two jobs just to afford ramen. Every family dinner where they discuss college funds for Logan and Ashley. But when I asked about help with community college, dad would say you need to learn independence. Letter continued, David and Susan think they're inheriting everything. They've been spending money they don't have. The new truck, kitchen, remodel, Logan's boat they borrowed against my estate. They get nothing. But there was more. Margaret pulled out another folder. Your grandmother hired a private investigator three years ago. She documented everything. Photos of me walking to work in the rain because my bike Broke screenshots of my parents social media posts bragging about their inheritance windfall while I lived on peanut butter sandwiches. Messages between Susan and her friends. Can't wait for the old bat to die so we can finally live properly. The investigator had recorded conversations too. Susan's voice came through crystal clear. Austin thinks he's family, but he's just David's mistake from his first marriage. Once Eleanor's gone, we'll have enough money to cut them off completely. Your grandmother was furious. Margaret said she changed her will six months ago. Your parents get nothing. Your siblings get $1,000 each. Everything else goes to you. The best part, the investigator had proof they'd already spent $200,000. They didn't have new credit cards, loans against their expected inheritance, deposits on a vacation home in Florida. I drove to their house with Margaret. It was Friday night, their weekly family dinner that I was never invited to. Through the window, I could see them celebrating with champagne and expensive takeout. Susan opened the door, saw us both, and her face lit up with greed. Finally, Margaret right. How much did mother leave us? We've been waiting so patiently. Logan and Ashley crowded behind her, practically bouncing with excitement. David appeared with a bottle of champagne, ready to toast their good fortune. I smiled. Actually. She left me everything and this letter explaining how you lied about me being adopted. Susan's face went white. That's impossible. You're not even real family. Oh, but I Am I pulled out the birth certificate get grandma had kept safe. My mother was Jennifer Caldwell, you know, Dad's first wife, the one you made him pretend never existed. David's champagne bottle slipped from his hands, shattering on their expensive marble floor, the floor they'd renovated with money they thought they'd inherit. This has to be a mistake, Ashley whispered. Margaret stepped forward. There's no mistake. Austin inherits two point one million dollars, the house and all investment accounts. You three children each receive $1,000. David and Susan receive nothing. Nothing. Susan's voice cracked. But we borrowed, we spent, oh, about that $200,000 you borrowed expecting your inheritance. I held up the legal paper. The bank wants it back tomorrow with interest. Logan started crying. But my boat payments, the vacation, house deposit, not my problem. I said. Maybe you should have treated your brother better. David finally found his voice. Austin, please, we can work this out. We're family. No, I said, looking him dead in the eye. Jennifer was family. Grandma, Eleanor was family. You're just the people who made my life hell for 21 years. Margaret handed them the official paper, papers you have 30 days to vacate any property belonging to the estate. Austin is the sole heir. As we walked away, I could hear Susan screaming at David, Ashley sobbing about her college fund being gone, and Logan frantically calling someone about returning his boat. Justice tastes sweeter than any inheritance money ever could. The house keys felt perfect in my hand.

I stared at Missus Peterson through my screen door, coffee mug frozen halfway to my lips. I don't mow my lawn with Scissors. That's insane. She shifted uncomfortably on my front porch, clutching her robe tighter against the morning chill. Well, someone does. Every Sunday at exactly 4 in the morning, I hear this snip snip snip sound coming from your yard. It wakes up my whole house. I glanced past her toward my front lawn, which looked perfectly normal. Green, well maintained, clearly cut with a regular mower, like every other yard on open Drive. Missus Peterson, I use a gas mower on Saturday afternoons. You've seen me do it dozens of times. Her expression shifted from annoyed to confused as she followed my gaze to the obviously machine cut grass. But the sound is definitely coming from your property. My husband heard it, too. What exactly does it sound like? I asked, stepping outside in my pajamas to get a better view of my yard. Missus Peterson made a cutting motion with her fingers, like someone trimming hedges, but rhythmic snip snip snip for hours. I walked around to my backyard, with her following close behind, both of us scanning for anything unusual. That's when I saw them. Tiny, perfect circles cut into the grass near my back fence, each about six inches in diameter, not random patches. But precise geometric patterns carved into the lawn with surgical precision. Missus Peterson, I didn't do this. My voice came out smaller than intended. The circles formed a complex design that would have taken hours to create with Scissors. And I've been found asleep every Sunday at 4:00am for the past month. I pulled out my phone and took photos of each circle, documenting the strange pattern while Mrs. Peterson watched nervously. The cuts were too clean for animals, too precise for lawn equipment, too deliberate for vandalism. Someone had been accessing my backyard weekly to create these designs while I slept. Have you seen anyone in my yard? I asked, but she shook her head. Her bedroom window faced the front of my house, not the back. I walked to my rear gate and found what I was looking for. Fresh scratches around the lock mechanism, tiny metal shavings on the ground. Evidence someone had been picking the lock repeatedly. My stomach dropped as I realized a stranger had been entering my property for weeks without my knowledge. Missus Peterson, I need to check something inside. I ran to my security system panel and pulled up the motion detector logs. Every Sunday for the past six weeks, the backyard sensor had triggered at exactly 3:00am, then again around 7:00am. But I dismissed these as false alarms from neighborhood cats. I scrolled through the digital records, finding the same pattern week after week. Someone had been studying my routine, waiting For me to fall into deep sleep before beginning their mysterious lawn art project. The precision of the timing suggested they knew my schedule better than I did. I called the police while Mrs. Peterson waited in my kitchen, both of us staring out the window at those perfect circles. Officer Bradley arrived within twenty minutes and examined the evidence with growing concern. This level of precision suggests obsessive behavior, he said. Photographing the circles and the damaged gate lock. Someone's been planning this for weeks, possibly months. He pointed to older scratches around the lock that I'd never noticed. These marks go back further than six weeks. This person's been accessing your property much longer than the lawn cutting. I felt violated in a way I couldn't articulate. Someone had been treating my home as their personal art studio while I slept defenseless inside. The officer recommended changing all my locks immediately and installing motion activated cameras throughout the backyard. Two weeks later, my new security cameras captured everything. Exactly 3:00am on Sunday, a figure in dark clothing climbed over my back fence and began the meticulous process of cutting grass with small scratching Scissors. But when I reviewed the footage in daylight, zooming in on the person's face, my world tilted completely. It was my ex boyfriend, Nathan, who had broken up with eight months ago after discovering he'd been secretly filming me in my own bathroom. The same Nathan who'd sworn he'd leave me alone after I Threatened a restraining order. The same Nathan who apparently still had a key to my back gate and when we dated, and had been using it to continue violating my space in increasingly elaborate ways. The circles weren't random art. When I printed out photos of all the patterns and arranged them chronologically, they spelled out words. Mine in the first week, forever in the second, watching in the third. Nathan had been leaving me messages in my own lawn, counting on my Assumption that the noise was just. Neighborhood maintenance Officer Bradley arrested Nathan the following Sunday as he climbed over my fence with his Scissors and a flashlight. The investigation revealed he'd been documenting his visits with photos, keeping a detailed journal of my daily routines, and planning to escalate to breaking into my house. Nathan got 18 months in jail for stalking and trespassing. I got new locks, better security cameras, and the knowledge that someone cutting grass at 4:00am is never just about lawn care.

Growing up, my dad had one phrase that he loved. My house, my rules. When I was 16 and wanted to dye my hair purple for junior year, he stood in the bath from doorway, blocking my path. Not under my roof, Alexis. You want purple hair, get your own place. When my boyfriend asked me to prom, dad made him sit through a two hour interrogation before declaring, no dating until you're 18. My house, my rules. I couldn't even watch PG thirteen movies until I was 17 because inappropriate content isn't welcome under my roof. My friends stopped coming over after dad made them sign a behavioral contract to enter our home. He controlled what I wore. No ripped jeans in my house. You look homeless. What I ate vegetarian phase. Not at my dinner table. And my opinions, too. You don't get to disagree with me while you're living rent free. When I got accepted to art school, he laughed. Art degree? Not with my money. You'll study business or nothing. Mom would whisper apologies when he wasn't looking, but never stood up to him. The worst part was his favourite closing line whenever I protested. When you have your own place, you can do whatever you want. Don't like it? There's the door. He'd literally point to the front door, knowing I had nowhere to go. At 17 with eight. Two dollars, In my savings account. Life isn't fair, Princess. The person who pays the bills makes the rules. Remember that. Well, I took student loans and went to art school anyway, living in a studio apartment with three roommates and a family of roaches. Dad called it learning life the hard way. Should have listened to me about that business degree, he'd say during Sunday dinners, while I was building my graphic design portfolio at 3 a m. Dad was getting comfortable in early retirement at 55, spending his days watching Fox News and calling me to criticize my lifestyle choices. Still living in that dump, he'd ask. Still single because you're too picky? Still wasting time on those computer drawings? His words hurt, but I kept going. Meanwhile, his perfect life started cracking. Mom finally left him after 30 years, tired of the controlling behavior. She's going through menopause, he told everyone, refusing to admit she'd simply had enough. Then his health declined, and he got diabetes. From decades of my house, my beer choices. He even refused to take his medications properly, because no doctor tells me what to do in my own home. Next, his house started falling apart, with a roof leaking and the foundation cracking. But he was too proud to ask for help. And too cheap to hire anyone. I built this house. I'll maintain it my way. By the time I landed my senior design director position, making six figures at 29, Dad was 67, living alone in a deteriorating house, alienated from most family members and struggling with basic tasks, but still preaching about his rules whenever anyone would listen. Then one day, my phone rang and his name popped up. Alexis. How's my successful daughter? Red Flag already? He never spoke that nicely. What do you need, dad? Can't a father call his daughter? You only call when you want something. Long pause. The house is getting to be too much. Your mother used to handle things, but now she's gone. I was thinking maybe I could stay with you for a while. I knew this was coming. He'd been posting on Facebook about his struggles, fishing for sympathy. But I wasn't going to just refuse because I had a secret plan. So I told him, of course you can stay with me. Dad. I have a

We all knew Holly would let the world burn if it meant keeping girls safe. She literally treated female friendship like a sacred religion. She'd walk wasted girls home from parties, share her last tampon with girls she'd never met, and somehow knew which guys to avoid before anyone else did. Every girl had her number saved for emergencies because they could all count on her to fix things. There was this one time at lunch when the football players were ranking girls by their bodies out loud. Holly walked right up to their table, took photos of all of them, and announced she post them on the school's parent Facebook age with exactly what they've been saying unless they apologize to every single girl individually. That was Holly's whole identity. She lived for female solidarity. She'd stay up all night talking girls through breakups, pretend to be someone's girlfriend to get creeps to back off, fight with teachers who dress coded girls unfairly. During junior year, when the cheerleaders started that toxic diet competition, Holly brought homemade cookies every day until they stopped weighing themselves. The girls would cry on her shoulder, trust her with their darkest secrets, and she treat protecting them like her life's purpose. Then winter break passed, and Holly showed up wearing headphones, staring at her phone, completely ignoring the circle of girls who'd been waiting to tell her their break Drama when Neva ran up crying about her boyfriend cheating, Holly literally stopped around her and kept walking. She didn't hold the door for the freshman girl carrying too many books. Didn't smile back at anyone. During lunch, Amira was sobbing about her parents'divorce, and Holly would have normally dropped everything to comfort her, but she sat alone the entire time. The worst part was when Sienna fainted in the hallway from not eating. Old Holly would have been the first one there. This. Holly glanced over, watch the nurse handle it, and went back to her homework. Girls kept approaching her all day. Summer needed a tampon. Holly shrugged and said she didn't have one. Freya asked for a ride home because she felt unsafe. Holly said, call Uber without looking up. We all thought she was going through something heavy, maybe seasonal depression, maybe family problems. Some girls organized an intervention. They cornered her after school with flowers and her favorite coffee. Hallie took one look at them and said, I'm not interested. Just that. Then walked to her car. Days turned into weeks. The girls went from concerned to desperate. They made a schedule to check on her, left notes in her locker, even got the counselor involved. Hallie told the counselor she was focusing on herself and there was nothing wrong. When that didn't work, they told one of our teachers. She asked Hallie why she wasn't helping organize the Women's Empowerment Orman Assembly. Halle responded, That's not my responsibility anymore. Then we all found out what happened. During a massive New Year's Eve party at Wyatt's house. Halle had gone with her closest friends, prepared to be designated driver and protect anyone. But then someone spiked her drink, and she started feeling really sick and disoriented. She'd managed to lock herself in an upstairs bath through when she realized something was seriously wrong. Holly had texted the group chat with her friends, the ones she called her soul sisters. She typed, please help. Something's wrong. I think someone

I jerked upright in bed, heart pounding against my ribs. What are you talking about? I don't do that. He held up his phone screen, glowing in the darkness of our bedroom. I have it on video, Julia. Every single night I watched myself on the hallway camera footage, standing perfectly still at our six year old daughter's door. Two kitchen knives clutched in my hands, one in each fist. The time stamp read 12:03 a m. That's not possible, I whispered. But there I was, motionless for hours. According to the fast forward layback, miles scrolled through multiple recordings from the past week. Same position, same knives, same bacon expression on my face. I had absolutely no memory of any of it. How long has this been happening? I asked, my voice cracking. Miles pulled up the footage history on his phone. I installed the camera a month ago when Mary mentioned hearing footsteps. Thought maybe she was sleepwalking. He showed me night after night of recordings. You stand there from midnight until almost 4:00am. Then you just walk back to bed. We reviewed more footage together. Sitting at the kitchen table with his laptop, I appeared at eleven fifty eight PM in every video. Retrieved the knives from the kitchen drawer and took my position like clockwork. Miles had dark circles under his eyes. I hadn't noticed. Before, I didn't want to scare you, but this isn't normal. Julia. We need to get you help. Have you asked Mary about this? I managed to ask. He nodded slowly. She says she hears tapping on her window sometimes. I checked outside, but never found anything. My blood turned cold. Tapping on her window. I instinctively stood up and walked to the knife drawer, pulling it open. The two largest knives were at the front, handles facing out. Had I arranged them that way? That night, I forced myself to stay awake. Miles set up his phone to record me, and I sat on the couch drinking coffee. At 11:45 p m, a strange heaviness washed over me. I fought against it, digging my nails into my palms. The I hit 11:00am and everything went black. I woke up at 407:00am, standing in our bedroom, miles staring at me with wide eyes. You just stood there again. I tried to talk to you, even shook you, but you were completely gone. He showed me the new footage. I looked like a statue. Unblinking, unmoving. Except for the subtle rise and fall of my chest. The next morning, I examined Mary's window from outside. Small scratches marked the frame, concentrated around the lock. Fresh marks overlapped older ones. My hands trembled as I took photos. Miles called the police while I questioned Mary. Tell me about the tapping sounds, sweetheart. She looked up from her coloring book. They stopped. A While ago. Now I just hear you walking around outside my door. Officer McCoy arrived within the hour and exam in the window. These are tool marks. Probably from someone trying to Jimmy the lock. She photographed everything meticulously. Has anyone been watching your house? Any strange vehicles? We couldn't think of anything unusual. She recommended motion sensors for the backyard and extra locks on Mary's window. Miles installed cameras outside that afternoon. If someone's been trying to get in, we'll catch them. That night, he stayed awake to monitor all the feeds while I inevitably blacked out. He kissed my forehead at 11:45 p m. Maybe your subconscious knows something we don't. At 12:47 a m, according to Miles's frantic retelling the next morning, a figure appeared at Mary's window. Dark clothing, face obscured by a hood. It produced a thin metal tool and worked at the lock while I stood guard inside. Knives ready. The figure tried for 20 minutes before giving up and disappearing into the shadows. Miles had called 9 1 1 immediately, but the intruder vanished before police arrived. Officer McCoy reviewed the footage with us. Bill, looks familiar. Height about 5 feet, 10 inches. The way they moved. She paused the video. Do you recognize anything? That's when it clicked. The slight hunch of the shoulders, the way they favored their left hand. Oh, my god. That's Isaac, our babysitter's boyfriend. The police moved fast. They arrested Isaac that morning at our

My best friend Ford, had the craziest parents. Last year, when he got an 89 on a pre test, they completely lost it. They blamed his social life and said, you're not allowed to take one step out of this house except for school. No exceptions. And they weren't kidding. He literally wasn't allowed to go to birthday parties, field trips, or even study groups. Saying, your friends are distractions. From now on, you focus only on academics. We tried to convince them that none of those things were a distraction, but they refused to listen. So when I handed Ford an invitation to my birthday, he handed it back with a deep frown. Sorry. You know, they'd never let me go. The whole not a single step out of this house rule, remember? But that's when my friend Logan had an idea. Then let's just carry you out. We stared at him, thinking it was the most ridiculous thing we'd heard. But when you fight crazy with crazier. Well, it was worth a shot. So we showed up to Ford's door for the first time with our first attempt, a rolling office chair. I rang the doorbell and took a deep breath. Good afternoon, Ford's wonderful parents. I need Ford for a group project. Oh, no. He strictly can't take one step out of the house. Yes, we know. So he won't. Ford grinned, seeing Us through the doorway and quickly leapt onto the office chair. He'll be in this seat the entire time. Not one step. Ford's parents stared like it was the stupidest thing they'd ever heard. But they couldn't exactly argue against it, either. So Ford rolled all the way to my birthday party. The next time we showed up, his mom instantly said, no rolling chairs allowed. Logan shrugged. Already prepared. Two other guys popped out from the bushes and helped us literally carry Ford out on our shoulders, like they do in funerals, but without the cat. Get you! Said he can't leave. We're removing him. That's the same thing, she argued. No, no. This is involuntary relocation. We kept switching up tactics. Every time, a new part of the rule got added. Can't exit the house through any doorway. We brought a ladder to his window and transported him away with a shopping cart. Can't leave without a chaperone. We printed out a cardboard cut out of his dad and carried that around, too. At some point, Ford managed to leave the house to go bowling with us just by dressing up in a costume and saying, well, I'm not Ford right now. I'm Iron Man. Unfortunately, that was the final straw. After his last stunt, Ford got completely grounded. No door, no phone, no anything. It's over. They won, I said, feeling down that he wasn't even able to go to the class's end of the year party. But Logan wasn't ready to give up. Logan gathered everyone and said, if Ford can't leave, I say we bring the party to Ford. Everyone cheered at the idea, and honestly, it was the best one he had yet. So that Saturday night, 30 of us showed up at once, carrying around our world history textbooks. Study group. Ford answered the door with a shocked expression. My parents just stepped out. What are you guys doing here? We grinned. Well

Since we've been married for five years. Lauren strutted into that Phoenix courtroom wearing a two thousand dollar dress I'd bought her, confident as hell. Her lawyer was already calculating his commission on what they thought would be a four million dollar payout for my construction business and dad's inheritance. The whole courtroom was packed. Lauren had actually invited some of her friends to watch what she called James's comeuppance. She been telling everyone for weeks how she was about to become independently wealthy. Your honor, her attorney announced, adjusting his expensive tie, missus Peterson deserves substantial compensation for supporting her husband's career growth during their five year marriage. Lauren actually winked at me from across the room. She thought I was just some heartbroken guy who'd roll over and pay whatever she demanded. Her friends in the gallery were practically grinning, waiting for the show. But here's what Lauren didn't know. Six months before I caught her cheating, I'd started noticing weird charges on our joint credit card. Expensive dinners at restaurants I've never been to, Hotel rooms booked during girls trips that didn't add up. Designer lingerie purchases that never made it home. The final straw was when I found an eight hundred dollar charge at a jewelry store downtown. When I asked Lauren about it, she said she bought herself a birthday present. Problem was, her birthday wasn't for four months. So I hired a private investigator named Frank. Best five thousand dollars I ever spent. Frank followed Lauren for six weeks, but he discovered was worse than I imagined. The yoga instructor was just the latest in a long line of affairs. There was also her personal trainer, a bartender from her favorite restaurant, and even one of my own business partners. Lauren had been using our joint accounts to fund these relationships. Expensive gifts, romantic getaways, even paying for her affairs. Gym memberships. She'd blown through nearly $50,000 of our money over two years. The two page document I handed Judge Ramirez wasn't financial records. It was Frank's detailed investigation report proving Lauren had been having multiple affairs for over two years. Complete with time stamped photos, hotel receipts, restaurant bills, and screenshots of explicit text messages. In Arizona, adultery doesn't automatically disqualify you from alimony. But it sure does when you've been systematically draining marital assets to fund your affairs. It's called waste of marital property, and it's a big deal in divorce court. The judge read the first page slowly, his eyebrows climbing higher with each line. To page two. Study the photos and then burst out laughing so hard his glasses nearly fell off. Mrs. Peterson, he said, trying to compose himself, not only are you getting nothing from this divorce, but according to this evidence, you owe your husband $47,000 for system malicious misuse of marital funds. Lauren's face went from smug to confused to horrified in about three seconds flat. Her friends in the gallery started whispering frantically. One of them actually got up and left. Her lawyer immediately started packing his briefcase, clearly realizing this case had just become a career nightmare instead of a payday. Furthermore, Judge Ramirez continued, given the extensive documentation of financial misconduct, Mrs. Peterson will be responsible for all legal

Then I saw the group photo. All of them, on a private beach in Maui. I stared at my phone in disbelief. My entire family had ditched my wedding for a vacation. The caption read, finally together. Like I didn't exist. But here's what they didn't know. For years, I've been quietly bankrolling their lifestyle. The family business cards all linked to my accounts. Their mortgage co signs my credit. The lake house utilities, auto pay from my bank. I've been the invisible ATM, funding their perfect lives while they whispered that my wife wasn't their kind of people. So I sent one text back. Perfect timing. Then I called my attorney. Within an hour, I'd cut off every shared account, canceled every auto payment, and revoked access to everything. The secondary property my sister lived in. She was using my credit for the rate. Not anymore. It started small. Day 3, the dealership called about a bounced car lease. Day 5, the office building sent late rent warnings. By week 2, the group chat was pure your chaos. Can someone cover the lakehouse utilities? My card got declined for Scottsdale. Does the company still cover insurance? They were scrambling, but still no apology. Just confusion about why their money fountain suddenly dried up. Then my sister called. First time since the wedding. Not congratulations or sorry we missed it. Just. You can't do this to us. I Didn't even answer. Just blocked the number. But the real fun was just beginning. See, I'd forgotten about one little detail. My dad's precious boat. The 40 foot yacht he loved showing off at the Marina every weekend. Guess whose name was on the insurance policy? Week 3, I got a call from the Marina. Sir, your boat insurance was declined for non payment. We need it removed by Friday or it gets impounded. I could have warned him. Should have, maybe. Instead, I drove to the Marina Thursday night with my wife and a bottle of champagne. We sat on the dock and watched them tow away Dad's pride and joy. My wife raised her glass. To new beginnings. To expensive lessons. I replied. The group chat exploded. The next morning, my aunt was practically screaming in all caps, the boat is gone! Who didn't pay the insurance? Dad called me 17 times. I let every single one go to voicemail. Each message got more desperate. Son, please call me back. There's been some mistake. We can work this out. Work what out? That I skipped my wedding for cocktails on a beach? Then my mom tried a different approach. She showed up at my office unannounced, tears streaming down her face. Security called up to ask if I wanted to see her. Tell her I'm in Maui, I said. The security guard paused. Sir, she says she's your mother. Not anymore. But the nuclear option came when my Uncle called. Uncle Rick, the family mediator. The guy who always smooth things over at Thanksgiving. His voice was shaking. Your father's having chest pains. The stress is killing him. You need to stop this. Funny, I said I had chest pains, too. Right around the time I saw 40 people I love. Choosing a vacation over the most important day of my life. That's different, friend, and you know it. You're right. Their betrayal was a choice. His consequences are karma. But then came the lawyers. Three weeks later, they tried to negotiate through legal channels. They wanted me back, but only if I left my wife. The contract literally said realignment of personal affiliations. That's when I knew they still

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently. And just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was 9 p m. On a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key. Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was soft, full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold hold in his eyes I've never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me He picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear. From rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialed a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine. It's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed six months ago? File everything. Tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my daughter. I hit another number. Dad, it's happening. Can you come get us? Bring the truck. Caroline, you can't just take her. Jonathan jumped up from the couch. I smiled, and I knew it looked cold as ice. Actually, I can see. Jonathan, I've been documenting your behavior for months. The times you called Nora a mistake. The texts where you said you wished she'd never been born. The videos of you screaming at her for normal kid things. His face went completely white. My lawyer has everything. Screenshots, recordings, witness statements from the neighbors who've seen how you treat her. I kissed Nora's forehead. She was finally starting to warm up in my arms. Oh, and here's my favorite part.

When I was 17, my classmate Derek threw 50 bucks at me in the school parking lot and desperately said, I need you to be my boyfriend for one hour to scare off my mom's church friends. His mom thought he was gay because she found his elaborate skincare routine and absolutely freaked out. She was bringing her entire prayer circle over for what she called a healing intervention to save Derek's soul from eternal damnation. Act super gay and make them uncomfortable, Derek explained frantically while pacing nervously. They'll get so weirded out they'll pack up and leave within 20 minutes. Easy money, right? I showed up at exactly three PM wearing the tightest jeans I could squeeze into and a bright pink shirt. I knocked on the door and screamed Derek, baby, so loud that neighbors three houses down started coming outside to see what catastrophe was happening. His mom answered with five absolutely horrified church ladies clustered behind her like a religious huddle. Prepare, preparing for spiritual warfare. I immediately bear hugged Derek and loudly announced Sweetie Pie. I brought us matching cucumber face masks and a carefully curated playlist of Broadway show tunes for a romantic spa day. Derek's face went completely pale, but I was fully committed to this Oscar worthy performance. For the next hour, I went into full theater kid mode like my life depended on it. I called him Sugar Plum Honey Bunny and my precious little cinnamon roll. I critiqued his mom's curtain choices with the intensity of a professional interior designer, started reorganizing their entire spice rack alphabetically while humming songs from Hamilton loudly complained that their throw pillows didn't match the seasonal aesthetic vision I was going for. The church ladies looked like they were watching a slow motion car crash that they couldn't look away from. One kept fanning herself frantically with a church program. Another was gripping her purse like it was a life saver in a stormy sea. Then I made my absolutely fatal mistake. I, I spotted their old dusty piano sitting in the corner and declared dramatically with full jazz hands, Derek, Honey, let's sing that special duet we've been practicing for the school talent show. Without waiting for his response, I launched into the most ridiculously over the top rendition of a Whole New World that is ever been performed outside of Broadway. Derek just stood there completely mortified and frozen like a deer in headlights. When I finished with a dramatic flourish, the church lady slowly started clapping. Then another joined in. Then all five of them erupted in thunderous applause like I had just performed at Carnegie Hall. Young man, the head church lady said with actual tears streaming down her weathered face. That was the most beautiful soul stirring thing I've ever heard in my entire life. Derek, you absolutely must.

I responded, bros before hoes, but moms before all. And everyone cracked up. Jason didn't smile, though. His face drained of color like I just confessed to murder. He grabbed all his stuff and moved 3 rows up the school bus without a word. Jason, what's wrong? I was just kidding. I called after him, but he wouldn't turn around. That's when I heard it stay. See, my girlfriend's best friend was crying her eyes out in the back row. When I turned to look, her friend whispered urgently in her ear and she glanced at me before crying harder. Okay, hey, that was definitely weird. I started to wonder whether my joke was really that offensive. That's when my phone buzzed. Three missed calls from dad, but there was no signal. And at the red light, I caught the bus driver wiping his eyes in the rearview mirror. In my three years of knowing him, the most emotion he'd shown was mild annoyance when kids left trash on the seats. A cold feeling crept into my stomach. I got up to go talk to Jason, but Missus Unfitzharris blocked the aisle. Sit down. We're moving. I just need to sit down. I'd never heard her voice like that. I sat. But the second we got to the destination, I cornered Jason. Dude, what is going On he backed away. Nothing. I just, I need space, bro. I was just kidding. I, I don't know if I'd pick my mom or my girlfriend. Why did you have to tell everyone what I said? Sid appeared out of nowhere and pulled me aside. Our team captain who never said more than pass the ball to me, grabbed my shoulders. Bro, if you need to talk about anything, I'm here. About what? I was almost shouting now. He just squeezed my shoulder and walked away. That cold feeling in my stomach was spreading. During the water break, Ryan shuffled over. This kid didn't even know my name. Yo. The blonde Kaylee from volleyball thinks you're cute. She's single now, too. The words hit like a punch. Dude, what the hell. I flashed him my lock screen. I have a girlfriend. His face went white. Just trying to help you move forward, man. Move forward. From what? He practically ran away. I tried calling my.

Oh, yeah, you like that? I yelled into my headset microphone. Beg daddy for more! I added. Just. My wife busted through my door. Gotcha! My wife shouted. Dozens of people poured into the room, glaring at me. My parents, her parents, my best friend, and even a lawyer were all there to witness the greatest misunderstanding of all time. So I told my wife I needed to focus for two hours because I had an important commitment with friends. I locked my office door and put a cute little do not disrupt sign on the outside. My wife ended up walking by and hearing me through the door, growling, yeah, baby, just like that. That's exactly what I've been asking for. She froze and pressed her ear against the door. Oh, Adam, you're so good at this! A high pitched feminine voice said, giggling. Are you staying on all night? I need you. My wife's hands started shaking. Her heart pounded. She heard me laugh and say something about getting dirty and going all night. She stumbled to our bedroom and sat on the bed staring at nothing. When I came out two hours later, I kissed her goodnight like nothing happened, not realizing that my wife was already brewing up a plan on how she'd end me. My wife started sitting beside my locked door, secretly recording all of the suspicious sessions on her phone. She caught the Female voice taunting Adam, is that the best you can do? And me responding with, I'm gonna destroy you so hard. Yes, daddy! The female giggled. My wife even managed to record me saying, I spent $500 on her last night, and I do it again. She's perfect. He's everything I wanted. With all the male voices congratulating me. My wife was understandably furious, showing the recordings to her sister. That's definitely a woman, her sister said. And she sounds young. Oh my god. Is your husband. Is he having an affair? They went to a divorce lawyer the next day. He listened to the recordings and nodded grimly. Get video evidence, he said. Get witnesses. We'll bury him in court. My wife assembled what she called the intervention team. Both sets of parents, my best friend, who she convinced would be saving me from myself, the lawyer with his phone ready to record, her sister with her phone is backup. Even our neighbor, who was just happy to be a part of something fun. We'll catch him mid fair, my wife said with rage in her eyes. And she did catch me doing something, just not what she was expecting. So that night, during my usual gaming session time, the entire intervention team burst through my door. Gotcha! My wife yelled, but everyone else just froze, staring at me and my computer monitor showing a cartoon dragon breathing rainbow fire at a bunch of wizards in ridiculous clothes. Um. Can I help you? I asked, blinking back at them. Adam! The high pitched female voice shrieked through my speakers. Did you just go AFK during the boss fight? We're dying here! My wife pointed at the speakers frantically. There! That's her! That's the woman he's been cheating on me with! What? Cheating? I pulled up my discord window and showed them the five male friends I've been gaming with every week. Ray, Simon, and three random teens that kick butt at the game. That voice you've been hearing. That's Ray, I said, pointing to the bald guy on the screen. He waved and said hi. With the female voice changer still on. Everyone took a step back in horror. He quickly turned the voice changer off. Oh, sorry about that, he said, now in his regular voice.

I said, fair enough, and quietly canceled our 85,000 dollar wedding. Her face went pale when she got the cancellation notice. I'm watching my ex fiance Bianca blow up my phone right now. She just found out I canceled our entire wedding that was supposed to happen in 4 months. See, I own a tech consulting firm that's done pretty well. Not yacht money, but comfortable. She's an influencer making maybe 30 k a year. When we got engaged last year after dating for 3 years, she immediately went into wedding planning overdrive. Not just any wedding. Her dream wedding. Historic 8 venue for $15,000, catering for 250 guests at $30,000, flowers for $8,000, photographer and videographer for $10,000. Her dress for $12,000, live band for $6,000. The list kept going. Total damage $85,000. I was fine with it initially. I loved her, wanted her happy, had the money saved. But then my lawyer friend Garrett pulled me aside at a barbecue. Yo, you getting a prenup? Haven't thought about it. Dude, you own a business. You need one. If she's cool, no harm done. So I brought it up that night casually. Hey, Garrett mentioned we should probably do a prenup. Standard stuff for business owners. The temperature in the room dropped in. You think I'm a gold digger? Bianca snapped. No, it's just standard legal Protection. If you loved me, you'd trust me. I do trust you. This is just. I'll Sign a prenup when hell freezes over. Bianca, be reasonable. You be reasonable. We're supposed to be partners. What's yours is ours, but what's mine is. Well, you know, I don't have money like you. Don't be ridiculous. God, why are you being so cheap? She stormed off. I figured she needed time to cool down. Nope. Next day, she told her whole family I was financially abusing her by asking for a prenup. Her mom, Deedee, called, screaming, how dare you insult my daughter like this? I asked for a standard prenup. That's not an insult. She's giving you the best years of her life. She's 28, not 80. And I'm giving her mine, too. A real man doesn't need contracts with his wife. Click. She hung up on me. Bianca came back that evening, acting like nothing happened. Started showing me centerpiece options. We need to resolve the prenup thing first. I said. There's nothing to resolve. I'm not signing it now. Roses or peonies? Bianca, I'm serious. So am I. Drop it or there won't be a wedding. Okay, good. So peonies? Sure. Whatever you want. She smiled, thinking she'd won. Started talking about napkin colors and chair sashes. I smiled and nodded, but went to bed thinking. Woke up knowing exactly what I had to do the next morning. I started making calls. Not dramatic ones, just practical ones. First, a venue explained I needed to cancel due to irreconcilable differences that have emerged. They were Surprisingly cool. Apparently this happens more than you'd think. Got 60% of my deposit back since it was over 120 days out. Next tater, same story. 50% back. Photographer actually gave me 100% back because he'd already booked another wedding for that date at a higher rate. Solid dude. Band, florist, everyone one by one quietly canceled. Didn't tell Bianca. Didn't tell anyone except my best friend Marcus, who thought I was either genius or insane. Meanwhile, Bianca was in full bridezilla mode, created a wedding Instagram, posted daily about becoming Mrs. My last name, and can't wait to marry my provider. Yeah, that post told me everything I needed to know. She kept pushing about other stuff too. You know, if you drop this prenup nonsense, I might consider having your groomsmen Marcus in the wedding party. Marcus is my best friend. He's already my best man. Well, I think my cousin.

My fiance Rebecca really picked the worst time to call me paranoid about her ex, Nate. We were literally sitting there tasting wedding cakes when she brought it up. She kept insisting they were just friends now and I was being controlling. The thing was, I'd come home early from a work trip last week and saw his car leaving our apartment complex at 2:00am. She had no idea I'd seen it. Every time his name popped up on her phone, she'd flip it face down real quick. When she called me insecure again, I decided to call her bluff. You're right. I'm being unfair. Let's invite Nate to your parents anniversary dinner next week, I said. I watched all the color drain from her face. She tried to backtrack, saying her family wouldn't want extra guests at the their special dinner, but I pushed harder. I'll call him myself to show I trust you. She was trapped and we both knew it. She agreed, but her hands were literally shaking that night. I called Nate and made sure to put him on speaker so Rebecca could hear everything. I told him I wanted to apologize for being the jealous boyfriend and invited him to the family dinner. Rebecca just sat there watching me, completely stuck. He tried to turn me down, said it wasn't a good idea, but I Kept pushing, telling him Rebecca really wanted him there. I even offered to pick him up myself, you know, to show there were no hard feelings. When I picked him up that night, the guy was sweating through his dress shirt.

Rebecca's mom dropped her wine glass, and it shattered all over the floor. Her Dad's face went from normal to purple in about two seconds. What is he doing here? He practically growled.

A text from Nate popped up on the screen. This was a mistake. We should be more careful. Everyone saw it. Her sister snatched the phone before Rebecca could grab it. More messages were right there on the lock screen. Meeting times. Last night was amazing. And what looked like photos being sent back and forth. Her dad jumped up so fast, his chair fell backwards. You're seeing him again. Nate was already heading for the door. Rebecca ran after him, begging him to wait. That's when her family just exploded. Her mom started telling me how Nate had cheated on Rebecca years ago with her own roommate. He'd lied about it six months. Straight. The whole family had been there for Rebecca through that nightmare of a breakup. And now she was sneaking around with him again. Two months before our wedding, Rebecca came back inside with her makeup running down her face. Her family looked at her like she was a strange. They kept telling me story after story about what Nate had put her through. How could you invite him here? Rebecca screamed at me. I stayed calm and reminded her that. She told me he was harmless. What was wrong with inviting a friend to dinner? Her family wouldn't stop listing all the terrible things Nate had done. The cheating, the constant lies, how he'd complete

So I moved across the country for my dream job. But six months later, she showed up at my door, saying, I'm ready to commit now, because distance doesn't matter when it's real love. And I laughed before introducing her to my new fiance, who was cooking dinner in our kitchen. I'm Marcus, 26, and when Jess dumped me six months ago, she said I was emotionally unavailable and socially stunted. Her exact words. You hide behind your work and can't form real connections. I need someone who actually has friends and knows how to be vulnerable. This happened right after I got accepted to my dream veterinary residency in Denver. We've been together two years, and I thought we were solid. I was planning to propose that Christmas, even had the ring picked out. The breakup destroyed me. I spent three days eating cereal in bed, questioning everything. Was I really that disconnected? Maybe she was right. Maybe I was just using her as a placeholder while focusing on my career. But I'd committed to the residency. So I packed up and drove to Denver with my clothes, textbooks, and a broken heart. If I was going to be miserable, at least I'd do something I loved. The animal hospital was this busy emergency clinic downtown. Doctor Peterson put me on 12 hour shifts immediately. I was so exhausted learning New procedures that I barely thought about. Jess. Something unexpected happened, though. My colleague Mike kept inviting me to trivia night at this time bar. I made excuses. Too tired, had studying. But Mike was persistent, and I finally gave in just to shut him up. Trivia night was actually fun. Mike's team called themselves the Possum 4 and competed against other medical professionals. I was weirdly good at Animal Facts, making me valuable for the first time in months. I was laughing and genuinely enjoying people's company. Mike introduced me to his hiking group. Outdoorsy medical people doing weekend trails around Colorado. I'd always loved nature, but never had anyone to explore with. Suddenly, I was spending Saturdays climbing mountains and having real conversations with people who weren't. Just then I started volunteering at the city animal shelter on days off. They needed someone with medical training for health assessments. That's where I met Diana. She was the shelter coordinator, this amazing woman who knew every single animal's personality and history. She'd work late with difficult rescue cases, and I started staying to help with medical check UPS. We talk for hours about each animal's progress and recovery stories. Diana had this gift for seeing potential in every broken creature. She was patient, compassionate, incredibly smart about animal behavior. Three months later, we went on our first date to a dog friendly brewery where half our shelter animals had been adopted. We spent the evening pointing out our kids And discussing dreams of opening our own rescue. Focused practice with Diana. Conversation felt effortless. We could talk about work, family, random thoughts. Everything flowed naturally. I'd never experienced that easy connection, even with Jess. Diana actually listened when I talked about cases. Last month, I proposed at the same dog park where we had our first date. I brought three shelter dogs, each wearing part of the message on their collars. Diana cried and said yes before I could even kneel. We moved in together two weeks ago into this cute apartment walking distance from both the hospital and shelter. Diana cooks most nights, since my schedule is insane, and I help with adoption paperwork and medical evaluations. Yesterday, coming home from a brutal shift, I saw someone on our apartment steps.

I took in a foster kid for a quick paycheck. I know how that sounds, but hear me out. Theo was 17 and had been returned by 14 families. I was broke and needed money to pay for my wife's early alzheimer's. Our bio son, Jaden, had been in prison for statutory rape, so it's not like we had other responsibilities. Theo moved in on a Thursday afternoon with one garbage bag of belongings and eyes that dared me to reject him. I showed him Jaden's old room, rattling off the rules like terms of a lease. He nodded once and disappeared behind the door. For weeks, we were just strangers sharing walls. He'd leave before my 5:00am alarm, and I'd come home at nine PM to find him already locked away, only the thin line of light under his door proving he existed. One afternoon, I heard the Arctic Monkeys blasting through his headphones while I made coffee. I told him it was my favorite band and we the music from Alexa instead. When I went grocery shopping, I picked up his favorite Celsius flavor without being asked. We developed a perfect rhythm without needing to talk. By month three, he knew me better than most of my coworkers. He'd replace my coffee pods before it ran out, so I'd make extra portions of dinner for when he felt like snacking. Almost like a real Family. If you squint. Then I got the call. You need to come get your wife. She's crazy. I found rose two blocks away in her thin nightgown, bare feet bleeding on the concrete. When I tried to wrap my jacket around her, she clawed at my face. Don't touch me! Where's my son? What did you do with my son? My heart shattered. The emts arrived and tried to grab her arms, but she fought harder, animal sounds coming from her throat I'd never heard before. That's when Theo appeared from the darkness. Fill in yesterday's clothes like he'd been awake all night. He started humming something I didn't recognize. Low and steady, like a heartbeat. Rose's whole body changed. The wild fear drained from her face as she turned toward the sound. My baby, she whispered, reaching out with shaking hands. You came back to me. Theo kept humming while walking closer, palms out where she could see them, moving like water. It's okay, missus K, he said in this soft voice I'd never heard. Like he'd done this before. Wanna go home? I'll make you tea. She grabbed his hand like a lifeline. The EMTs let him ride in the ambulance. He sat next to her gurney, thumb tracing circles on her palm, humming whenever her breathing quickened. By the time we hit the ER, she was calm enough. They skipped the restraints. The doctor pulled me aside near the vending machines, his voice low. If that Kid hadn't calmed her down, we would have been forced to put her in an involuntary hold. I turned to look at Theo, but he didn't say anything. Instead, he pulled out the spiral notebook I'd always seen him carrying. As he. I flipped through, my heart throbbed. Each page was filled with documentation on my wife's progress. All those mornings I'd found her peaceful in bed, thinking the new meds were working. It was him. We brought rose home as the sun came up. I went to make coffee, hands still shaking, and noticed the kitchen trash overflowing. I pulled the bag out and envelope spilled everywhere. M I T, Stanford, Burk play. All college acceptances. All dated exactly three months ago. Right when her night terrors started. They were too far from here, was all he said when I asked. That's when I knew this kid wasn't placement anymore. He was family. A week later, my phone rang. Jade

My best friend Ford had the craziest parents. Last year, when he got an 89 on a pre test, they completely lost it. They blamed his social life and said, you're not allowed to take one step out of this house except for school. No exceptions. And they weren't kidding. He literally wasn't allowed to go to birthday parties, field trips, or even study groups. Saying, your friends are distractions. From now on, you focus only on academics. I tried to convince them that none of those things were a distraction, but they refused to listen. So when I handed Ford an invitation to my birthday, he handed it back with a deep frown. Sorry. You know, they'd never let me go. The whole not a single, single step out of this house rule, remember? But that's when my friend Logan had an idea. Then let's just carry you out. We stared at him, thinking it was the most ridiculous thing we'd heard. But when you fight crazy with crazier. Well, it was worth a shot. So we showed up to Ford's door for the first time with our first attempt, a rolling office chair. I rang the doorbell and took a deep breath. Good afternoon. Ford's wonderful parents need Ford for a group project. Oh, no. He strictly can't take one step out of the house. Yes, we know. So he won't. Ford grinned, seeing Us through the doorway and quickly leapt onto the office chair. He'll be in this seat the entire time. Not one step. Ford's parents stared like it was the stupidest thing they'd ever heard. But they couldn't exactly argue against it, either. So Ford rolled all the way to my birthday party. The next time we showed up, his mom instantly said, no rolling chairs allowed. Logan shrugged. Already prepared. Two other guys popped out from the bushes and helped us literally carry Ford out on our shoulders, like they do in funerals, but without the CAS. Get. You said he can't leave. We're removing him. That's the same thing, she argued. No, no. This is involuntary relocation. We kept switching up tactics. Every time, a new part of the rule got added. Can't exit the house through any doorway. We brought a ladder to his window and transported him away with a shopping cart. Can't leave without a chaperone. We printed out a cardboard cut out of his dad and carried that around, too. At some point, Ford managed to leave the house to go bowling with us just by dressing up in a costume and saying, well, I'm not Ford right now. I'm Iron Man. Unfortunately, that was the final straw. After his last stunt, Ford got completely grounded. No door, no phone, no anything. It's over. They won, I said, feeling down that he wasn't even able to go to the class's end of the year party. But Logan wasn't ready to give up. Logan gathered everyone and said, if Ford can't leave, I say we bring the party to Ford. Everyone cheered at the idea, and honestly, it was the best one he had yet. So that Saturday night, 30 of us showed up at once, carrying around our world history textbooks. Study group. Ford answered the door with a shocked expression. My parents just stepped out. What are you guys doing here? We grinned. Welcome to the end of the year party, bro. We instantly set up for the party. Disco ball hanging from the living room ceiling fan, set up a small DJ counter in the kitchen, and pulled out all the food and snacks.

My fiance Rebecca really picked the worst time to call me paranoid about her ex, Nate. We were literally sitting there tasting wedding cakes when she brought it up. She kept insisting they were just friends now and I was being controlling. The thing was, I'd come home early from a work trip last week and saw his car leaving our apartment complex at 2:00am. She had no idea I'd seen it. Every time his name popped up on her phone, she'd flip it face down real quick. When she called me insecure again, I decided to call her bluff. You're right.

Four years later, I found them in our bed three days before our wedding. My fiance Jessica, and her stepbrother, Braden. She didn't even try to explain. Just looked at me and said, I love him. Her engagement ring was still on. While she held his hand, Braden smirked. Sorry, man. It just happened. Their parents had married two years ago. At night, Jessica posted photos with Braden like nothing happened. Changed her relationship status. While our wedding vendors were still calling me. I had to cancel everything alone. The venue, the flowers, the honeymoon. Each call was humiliation. The hotel manager asked, if is the bride okay? I couldn't even answer. But I turned that rage into purpose. Studied for the bar exam like my life depended on it. Passed first try. Got hired as a paralegal at a family law firm. My job? Research custody cases and find evidence. My boss said I had unusual drive. I had unusual motivation. While I Learned every detail about custody battles and what makes a parent unfit. Jessica and Braden played house. A daughter posted family photos online. Their parents barely visited, but they insisted their love was worth it. I became the firm's best researcher. The paralegal who found evidence that won cases. Lawyers requested me for their hardest custody battles. I knew exactly what judges looked for, what evidence mattered, how to prove someone was lying about being A good parent. Three years in, I was the go to person for impossible cases. I turned my pain into expert peace. While Jessica and Braden raised their daughter, I became an expert at determining who deserved to keep their kids. Life has a strange sense of humor. Four years later, Braden walked into my firm. I was in the conference room, and I heard his voice at reception, desperate, explaining how Jessica wanted full custody of their daughter. My boss knocked. Can you handle this case? Do the research? I almost said no. Then curiosity one. Braden looked destroyed. Didn't recognize me at first. I changed. Lost weight, expensive suit, different hairstyle. He was too focused on his problem. She's saying I'm an unfit father, that our relationship was wrong from the start. Then he really looked at me. His face went white. Your. Oh, god. Started to leave, but my boss insisted. Please sit. We're here to help. Braden slumped back down, kept glancing at me while explaining Jessica had cheated with her trainer, now wanted their daughter. Was telling the court Braden wasn't a good father, that their relationship had been unhealthy. The irony was perfect. She'd left me for him. Now she was leaving him and trying to take their child. My boss assured Braden, we take the case. Braden didn't realize I'd be building the entire case, finding every piece of evidence that would determine if he kept his daughter. I spent three weeks investigating Found Jessica's texts to friends bragging about her trainer. Discovered she'd been leaving their daughter with babysitters constantly. Located witnesses who saw Braden at every school event while Jessica was at the gym. Built a file proving who the real parent was.

My mom clinked her fork against her glass and stood up. Before we sing Happy Birthday to my daughter, I want everyone to know we're also celebrating Moira's half birthday today. My 16 year old sister Moira bounced up from her chair and rushed to stand behind my birthday cake, giggling. Another birthday stolen right in front of me. It's my 18th birthday, I said. Can I have just this one birthday for myself? Mom stared daggers at me. Don't be selfish. Birthdays are meant for sharing, and we do this every year. Dad added. Why are you suddenly making it a problem? But that was exactly the problem. Every year I had to deal with my parents putting Moira first. And sure, it was cute back when Moira was three and I was five. I mean, who wouldn't say all when your toddler sister helps blow out your candles for the first time? But that was the thing. We were kids. But that cute incident didn't stop there. During Christmas, my parents let her tear open her gifts first before turning around and opening mine, too. You're too old to be excited with opening presents anyway, mom said. I was 8. My 10th birthday dinner was at Chuck E. Cheese instead of the Japanese restaurant I wanted. All because Moira threw a tantrum about wanting pizza. My 12th birthday got canceled when Moira woke up with a really bad Tummy ache. Which happened to suddenly disappear an hour after telling everyone not to show up. And on my 16th birthday, my parents forgot all about it. So this year was really it. I was an adult and didn't have to put up with their crap any longer. I looked down at my birthday cake, with Moira's name written beautifully and mine squeezed into the bottom corner in sloppy letters, completely misspelt, and just lost it. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear! I blew out the candles right there. Every single one. Before Moira could make her move, the singing instantly fell apart. Every person in the room went completely silent. What the heck? Moira shrieked. Why did you blow out my cake? Our cake! I said with a smile. I grabbed the presents my parents neatly wrapped on the side for my sister and ripped open the first box. AirPods! Wow! I've been asking for this for four years! Those are Moira's half birthday presents. Mom stood up so fast, her chair scraped against the floor. Exactly. I can't wait to share it. I opened another box. Oh, A Lululemon gift card! Thanks so much! I carefully opened the rest of my gifts, making snarky comments like, oh, Moira! This isn't the color Moira likes. Guess I'll just keep it for myself. You don't mind, right, Moira? All the guests stared at her. Moira started crying, real tears streaming down her face. She's ruining everything! Make her stop! This is what we always do, I said, staying perfectly calm. I don't understand why you're upset. Dad's face turned red. You're going too far. This is cruel. Too far? I looked at him. This is exactly what happens at every birthday of mine. The only difference is I'm not allowed to cry about it. Mom's voice cracked, horrified by the sudden public exposure. You're older, you should know better. So when I was five and she was three, I should have known better? You're ruining her special moment, dad said, grabbing the AirPods out of my hands. Her special moment! I burst out into laughter, pointing to the. Hey, this is my birthday! Moira is quite literally 4 months away. Funny how all this sharing stuff only applies when it's my birthday. I mean, go ahead, name one time Moira had to share her party. No

Mason threw industrial cleaning solution in my mother's face during what was supposed to be my college graduation dinner. The restaurant erupted into absolute chaos as my mother collapsed, screaming while her skin literally bubbled and peeled away from her skull. I couldn't move, couldn't breathe, couldn't comprehend what Mason had just done. My father tackled him to the ground, punching him repeatedly. I wanted to scream, but my throat wouldn't work as I watched my mother's face dissolve. He's been stealing Beatrice's identity for three years, Mason shouted while trying to shield himself from my father's fists as two of my uncles jumped in to help restrain him, all of them slipping in, the blood spreading across the floor. She's been using their identical resemblance to drain her bank accounts. I was barely listening. My legs gave out and I crashed into a chair. But my father hesitated for just a second, his fist raised in the air, and Mason spit blood onto the floor while my mother rolled and thrashed, knocking over chairs and leaving smears of flesh on everything she touched. I have video of her at five different banks, he yelled over my mother's inhuman screaming, holding the screen up while my uncle twisted his arm. I noticed discrepancies in Beatrice's accounts when we were apartment hunting and installed tracking software. And I've caught her mother stealing $40,000. My mother writhed on the floor and tried to speak. But only managed to spray blood across the white tablecloth while her face continued to dissolve. And even through the destroyed flesh, I could see something in that look that made my stomach drop. Because it wasn't Niall. It was rage at being caught. Those accounts are family money! She finally shrieked through her melted mouth the words. Barely human mom, I whispered, but I couldn't hear my own voice over the chaos of people screaming and crying and calling 9 1 1, while my mother's face kept bubbling and peeling like plastic in a fire. My father grabbed the phone from Mason with hands covered in my mother's blood and skin, staring at the screen where my mother was clearly at an ATM wearing my clothes, and his face went white. Linda, you've been stealing from our daughter? He asked while she convulsed on the floor, her screaming never stopping. She owes me everything! My mother managed to hiss between streaks of agony, blood and tissue dripping onto the floor. I gave up my career to raise her. The other diners were pressed against the walls, filming everything, while the manager was vomiting in the corner and servers were sobbing. And I felt like I was drowning because my own mother had been systematically destroying my future while her face was literally falling off in front of me. You destroy her face over money! My father shouted at Mason, releasing him and stumbling backward, slipping in the puddle of Blood and chemicals. Even if she stole from Beatrice, you threw acid at my wife. Mason wiped blood from his broken nose and looked directly at me with an expression that made my blood freeze. That's not why I had to destroy her face. Everyone went silent except for my mother's whimpering and the sound of her skin sizzling, and I heard myself ask, what do you mean? That's not why I followed her to a P O. Box yesterday, Mason said quietly. Check her purse. My mother started, shrieking even louder and trying to crawl toward her bag, leaving a trail of dissolved flesh. But my father got there first and dumped it onto the floor, where a small glass vial rolled out. That's Wrayson, Mason said, his voice deadly calm.

I need someone who actually has friends and knows how to be vulnerable. This happened right after I got accepted to my dream veterinary residency in Denver. We've been together two years, and I thought we were solid. I was planning to propose that Christmas, even had the ring picked out. The breakup destroyed me. I spent three days eating cereal in bed, questioning everything. Was I really that disconnected? Maybe she was right. Maybe I was just using her as a placeholder while focusing on my career. But I'd committed to the residency. So I packed up and drove to Denver with just my clothes, textbook, and a broken heart. If I was going to be miserable, at least I'd do something I loved. The animal hospital was this busy emergency clinic downtown. Doctor Peterson put me on 12 hour Shifts immediately. I was so exhausted learning new procedures that I barely thought about Jess. Something unexpected happened, though. My colleague Mike kept inviting me to trivia night at this dive bar. I made excuses. Too tired, had studying. But Mike was persistent, and I finally gave in just to shut him up. Trivia night was actually fun. Mike's team called themselves the Possum 4 and competed against other medical professionals. I was weirdly good at Animal Facts, making me valuable for the first time in months. I was laughing and genuinely enjoying people's company. Mike introduced me to his hiking group. Outdoorsy medical people doing weekend trails around Colorado. I'd always loved nature, but never had anyone to explore with. Suddenly, I was spending Saturdays climbing mountains and having real conversations with people who weren't. Just then I started volunteering at the city animal shelter on days off. They needed someone with medical training for health assessments. That's where I met Diana. She was the shelter coordinator, this amazing woman who knew every single animal's personality and history. She'd work late with difficult rescue cases, and I started staying to help with medical check UPS. We talked for hours about each animal's progress and recovery stories. Diana had this gift for seeing potential in every broken creature. She was patient, compassionate, incredibly smart about animal behavior. Three months later, we went on our first date to a dog friendly brewery where half our shelter animals had been adopted. We Spent the evening pointing out our kids and discussing dreams of opening our own rescue. Focused practice with Diana. Conversation felt effortless. We could talk about work, family, random thoughts. Everything flowed naturally. I'd never experienced that easy connection, even with Jess. Diana actually listened when I talked about cases. Last month, I proposed at the same dog park where we had our first date. I brought three shelter dogs, each wearing part of the message on their collars. Diana cried and said yes before

So I've been helping my older sister Brisa, plan her wedding since the day she got engaged. We're talking eight months of venue tours, cake tastings, and color swatching. Every shade of lush pink known to mankind. She called me her angel sister to everyone, bragging about how she couldn't imagine doing any of this without me. We spent every Sunday together working on centerpieces, addressing invitations, making those little favor bag. Never once did we argue about anything. Then, two weeks before her big day, we're at the final bridesmaid dress fitting downtown. I step out of the dressing room in this dusty rose dress she picked, and I watch her face just completely change. She goes quiet for the rest of the appointment, barely looks at me. That night, I'm meal prepping for the week when my phone rings. We need to talk about the wedding, she says, and her voice is ice cold. I'm thinking maybe there's a vendor issue or something. Then she hits me with, you're out of the wedding party. Actually, don't even come to the wedding at all. She tells me I looked too good in the bridesmaid dress, and she won't have me stealing attention on her special day. I literally laughed because I thought she was joking. We're sisters. I offered to wear a different dress, do my hair different, wear less makeup. Literally anything. But she's Dead serious. This is my wedding and my day. I don't want you there. I could have fought her on it. Could have called our parents, made it into this whole family drama. But honestly, if she really felt that threatened by me just existing in a bridesmaid dress, then fine. I told her, okay, if that's what you want. She sounded surprised, like she expected me to beg or cry or something. That night, I started going through all my emails. Every vendor communication is in my inbox because I'm the one who's been handling everything. The venue, that's my boss's country club, and he gave us the friends and family discount. The florist, she's a client from my job. The photographer, charging $2,000 instead of his usual six thousand dollars. I designed his entire website portfolio for free last year. The caterer, the DJ, the bartenders, even the hair and makeup team. They're all doing this as favors to me, not her. My sister has no idea that every single contract is technically under my name. The next morning, I called Brisa one more time. Just so you know, if I'm not part of the wedding, I'll need to cancel all the arrangements I made through my connections. She immediately snaps back, good, I don't want anything from you. Anyway, she hung up before I could say anything. I don't think she had any clue what that meant. I spent the rest of that day making calls. First The venue. I explained that I won't be attending the wedding anymore, so I need to cancel the reservation I made. My boss is confused but says no problem. Next. The florist. She's actually offended when I tell her what happened and says she wouldn't work with my sister now even if she begged. The photographer is booked solid and happily takes another wedding for that date at his full rate. One by one, I cancel everything. The caterer, the DJ, the Baker who was doing a five tier for the price of three. I also canceled the two surprises I planned as a gift. I've been secretly paying for the premium open bar package and upgraded their honeymoon suite to the penthouse.

My mom clinked her fork against her glass and stood up. Before we sing Happy Birthday to my daughter, I want everyone to know we're also celebrating Moira's half birthday today. My 16 year old sister Moira bounced up from her chair and rushed to stand behind my birthday cake, giggling. Another birthday stolen right in front of me. It's my 18th birthday, I said. Can I have just this one birthday for myself? Mom stared daggers at me. Don't be selfish. Birthdays are meant for sharing, and we do this every year. Dad added. Why are you suddenly making it a problem? But that was exactly the problem. Every year I had to deal with my parents putting Moira first. And sure, it was cute back when Moira was three and I was five. I mean, who wouldn't say all when your toddler sister helps blow out your candles for the first time? But that was the thing. We were kids. But that cute incident didn't stop there. During Christmas, my parents let her tear open her gifts for first before turning around and opening mine too. You're too old to be excited with opening presents anyway, mom said. I was 8. My 10th birthday dinner was at Chuck E. Cheese instead of the Japanese restaurant I wanted. All because Moira threw a tantrum about wanting pizza. My 12th birthday got canceled when Moira woke up with a really Bad tummy ache which happened to suddenly disappear an hour after telling everyone not to show up. And on my 16th birthday, my parents forgot all about it. So this year was really it. I was an adult and didn't have to put up with their crap any longer. I look down at my birthday cake, with Moira's name written beautifully and mine squeeze into the bottom corner in sloppy letters, completely misspelled, and just lost it. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear! I blew out the candles right there. Every single one. Before Moira could make her move, the singing instantly fell apart. Every person in the room went completely silent. What the heck? Moira shrieked. Why did you blow out my cake? Our cake! I said with a smile. I grabbed the presents my parents neatly wrapped on the side for my sister and ripped open the first box. AirPods! Wow! I've been asking for this for four years! Those are Moira's half birthday presents. Mom stood up so fast, her chair scraped against the floor. Exactly. I can't wait to share it. I opened another box. Ooh, a Lululemon gift card! Thanks so much! I carefully opened the rest of my gifts, making snarky comments like, oh, Moira, this isn't the color Moira likes. Guess I'll just keep it for myself. You don't mind, right, Moira? All the guests stared at her. Moira started crying, real tears streaming down her face. She's ruining everything! Make her Stop! This is what we always do, I said, staying perfectly calm. I don't understand why you're upset. Dad's face turned red. You're going too far. This is cruel. Too far? I looked at him. This is exactly what happens at every birthday of mine. The only difference is I'm not allowed to cry about it. Mom's voice cracked, horrified by the sudden public exposure. You're older. You should know better. So when I was five and she was three, I should have known better? You're ruining her special moment, dad said, grabbing the AirPods out of my hands. Her special so moment. I burst out into laughter, pointing to the cake. This is my birthday. Moira's is quite literally four months away. Funny how all this sharing stuff only applies when it's my birthday. I mean, go ahead. Name one time Moira had to share her party. Nothing. Complete silence. Yeah, that's what I thought.

Growing up, my dad had one phrase that he loved. My house, my rules. When I was 16 and wanted to dye my hair purple for junior year, he stood in the bathroom doorway, blocking my path. Not under my roof, Alexis. You want purple hair, get your own place. When my boyfriend asked me to prom, dad made him sit through a two hour interrogation before declaring, no dating until you're 18. My house, my rules. I couldn't even watch P G. 13 movies until. Till I was 17 because inappropriate content isn't welcome under my roof. My friends stopped coming over after dad made them sign a behavioral contract to enter our home. He controlled what I wore. No ripped jeans in my house. You look homeless. What I ate. Vegetarian phase. Not at my dinner table. And my opinions, too. You don't get to disagree with me while you're living rent free. When I got accepted to art school, he laughed. Art degree? Not with my money. You'll study business or nothing. Mom would whisper apologies when he wasn't looking, but never stood up to him. The worst part was his favorite closing line whenever I protested. When you have your own place, you can do whatever you want. Don't like it? There's the door. He'd literally point to the front door, knowing I had nowhere to go. At 17, with $82 in My saving account. Life isn't fair, Princess. The person who pays the bills makes the rules. Remember that. Well, I took student loans and went to art school anyway, living in a studio apartment with three roommates and a family of roaches. Dad called it learning life a hard way. Should have listened to me about that business degree, he'd say during Sunday dinners while I was building my graphic design portfolio at 3 a m. Dad was getting comfortable in early retirement at 55, spending his days watching Fox News and calling me to criticize my lifestyle choices. Still living in that dump? He'd ask. Still single because you're too picky? Still wasting time on those computer drawings? His words hurt, but I kept going. Meanwhile, his perfect life started cracking. Mom finally left him after 30 years, tired of the controlling behavior. She's going through menopause, he told everyone, refusing to admit she'd simply had enough. Then his health declined, and he got diabetes from decades of my house, my beer choices. He even refused to take his medications properly because no doctor tells me what to do in my own home. Next, his house started falling apart, with the roof leaking and the foundation cracking. But he was too proud to ask for help and too cheap to hire anyone. I built this house. I'll maintain it my way. By the time I landed my senior design director position, making six figures at 29, Dad was 67 Living alone in a deteriorating house, alienated from most family members and struggling with basic tasks, but still preaching about his rules whenever anyone would listen. Then one day, my phone rang and his name popped up. Alexis. How's my successful daughter? Red Flag already? He never spoke that nicely. What do you need, dad? Can't a father call his daughter? You only call when you want something. Long pause. The house is getting to be too much. Your mother used to handle things, but now she's gone. I was thinking maybe I could stay with you for a while. I knew this was coming. He'd been posting on Facebook about his struggles, fishing for sympathy. But I wasn't going to just refuse because I had a secret plan. So I told him, of course you can stay with me. Dad. I have a sweet. His voice brightened immediately. Good. It's your duty as my daughter. I almost burst out laughing. Sure, dad, but I need to explain the house rules. What rules? Well, my house, my rules, remember? His voice turned sour immediately. Alexis, you can't be serious. Dead serious. First, visiting hours are 10 a m. To 8 p m. I work from home and need quiet. No Fox News. It's too negative for my workspace. Breakfast is at 7, lunch at noon, dinner at 6. Bedtime is 9 p m. Because I don't want to hear T V. After that, I heard his voice crack, and he Became super angry. This is ridiculous! You can't impose rules on me.

My best friend Ford had the craziest parents. Last year, when he got an 89 on a pre test, they completely lost it. They blamed his social life and said, you're not allowed to take one step out of this house except for school. No exceptions. And they weren't kidding. He literally wasn't allowed to go to birthday parties, field trips, or even study groups. Saying, your friends are distractions. From now on, you focus only on academics. I tried to convince them that none of those things were a distraction, but they refused to listen. So when I handed Ford an invitation to my birthday, he handed it back with a deep frown. Sorry. You know, they'd never let me go. The whole not a single step out of this house rule, remember? But that's when my friend Logan had an idea. Then let's just carry you out. We stared at him, thinking it was the most ridiculous thing we'd heard. But when you fight crazy with crazier. Well, it was worth a shot. So we showed up to Ford's door for the first time with our first attempt, a rolling office chair. I rang the doorbell and took a deep breath. Good afternoon, Ford's wonderful parents. I need Ford for a group project. Oh, no. He strictly can't take one step out of the house. Yes, we know. So he won't. Ford grinned, seeing Us through the doorway and quickly leapt onto the office chair. He'll be in this seat the entire time. Not one step. Ford's parents stared like it was the stupidest thing they'd ever heard. But they couldn't exactly argue against it, either. So Ford rolled all the way to my birthday party. The next time we showed up, his mom instantly said, no rolling chairs allowed. Logan shrugged. Already prepared. Two other guys popped out from the bushes and helped us literally carry Ford out on our shoulders, like they do in funerals, but without the casket. You said he can't leave. We're removing him. That's the same thing, she argued. No, no. This is involuntary relocation. We kept switching up tactics. Every time, a new part of the rule got added. Can't exit the house through any doorway. We brought a ladder to his window and transported him away with a shopping cart. Can't leave without a chaperone. I printed out a cardboard cut out of his dad and carried that around, too. At some point, Ford managed to leave the house to go bowling with us just by dressing up in a costume and saying, well, I'm not Ford right now. I'm Iron Man. Unfortunately, that was the final straw. After his last stunt, Ford got completely grounded. No door, no phone, no anything. It's over. They won, I said, feeling down that he wasn't even able to go to the class. This is end of the year. Party! But Logan wasn't ready to give up. Logan gathered everyone and said, if Ford can't leave, I say we bring the party to Ford. Everyone cheered at the idea, and honestly, it was the best one he had yet. So that Saturday night, 30 of us showed up at once, carrying around our world history textbooks. Study group. Ford answered the door with a shocked expression. My parents just stepped out. What are you guys doing here? We grinned. Welcome to the end of the year party, bro. We instantly set up for the party. Disco ball hanging from the living room ceiling fan. Set up a small DJ counter in the kitchen and pulled out all the food and snack. Next in the fridge and pantry. The entire house became a party. Kids were dancing while holding textbooks. Someone started a conga line through the kitchen. The base was shaking family photos off the walls. When Ford's parents got back home, their faces drained of color, instantly watching a bunch of kids go wild.

I knew dating Rachel meant getting past her three older brothers, but I had no idea they'd turned protecting her into a military operation. She'd been with a guy named Jeff for two years, and he'd broken her jaw when she tried to leave him. So now her brothers treated every man who looked at her like a potential threat. The first time I picked her up for dinner, her oldest brother answered the door holding a baseball bat like he was stepping up to home plate. The middle brother stood behind him, cracking his knuckles, while the youngest just stared at me, taking photos with his phone, probably for some criminal database they were building. Rachel pushed past them, looking mortified, but I caught the oldest one mouthing, we're watching you. As we walked to my car. They threw literally everything at me to see if I'd crack or run away screaming. Every restaurant we went to, somehow one brother would already be there, pretending to read a menu upside down while photographing my every move. During our third date, the youngest brother actually sat down at our table uninvited and said, so what exactly are your intentions with our sister? Because we've got shovels, and we know how to use them. Instead of getting angry, I looked him straight in the eye and said, my intention is to never give you a reason to Use them, which made him blink first. They ran background checks and left the results on my windshield with certain thing circled in red marker like a teacher grading papers. The middle brother created a fake Instagram profile as a woman named Jessica and sent me messages trying to get me to cheat, but I just screenshot everything and sent them to Rachel saying, your brother needs to work on his catfishing skills because Jessica types exactly like him. When they followed us to the movies, I bought them popcorn and had the usher deliver it to their seats with a note saying next time just join us instead of lurking, which actually made the youngest one laugh. I started leaving gift cards for coffee on their trucks. I spotted them tailing us with notes like stalking must be exhausting, so caffeine's on me, and eventually the oldest brother actually used one. The breakthrough came when I showed up at their mother's birthday even though Rachel warned me they'd told me the wrong time on purpose. I arrived three hours early with flowers for their mom and helped her cook while she told me embarrassing stories about all four of her kids. By the time everyone else arrived, I was wearing her apron and knew about the time the oldest brother cried watching The Lion King at age 16. He pulled me aside later and said that was sneaky as hell, but he was almost smiling when he said It. After two months of this dance, where I matched every test with patience and humor, the middle brother finally asked me directly, why haven't you given up yet? We've broken seven guys before you. I told him the truth. That Rachel was worth whatever bizarre hazing ritual they needed to put me through. The real test came during Rachel's company holiday party, when I stepped outside for air and found all three brothers waiting by my car. The oldest one stepped forward and said, she's getting attached, and we need to know if you're going to hurt her. Before I could answer, we heard Rachel scream from the parking garage and saw her backing away from a man I recognized from photos as Jeff, who'd been released early for good behavior.

I grabbed a cake cutter and started slicing up pieces and placing them on paper plates to hand out to guests.

She just found out I canceled our entire wedding that was supposed to happen in 4 months. See, I own a tech consulting firm that's done pretty well. Not yacht money, but comfortable. She's an influencer making maybe 30 k a year. When we got engaged last year after dating for three years, she immediately went into wedding planning overdrive. Not just any wedding.

Yo, you getting a prenup? Haven't thought about it. Dude, you own a business. You need one. If she's cool, no harm done. So I brought it up that night casually. Hey, Garrett mentioned we should probably do a prenup. Standard stuff for business owners. The temperature in the room dropped in. You think I'm a gold digger? Bianca snapped. No, it's just standard legal Protection. If you loved me, you'd trust me. I do trust You. This is just. I'll sign a prenup when hell freezes over. Bianca, be reasonable. You be reasonable. We're supposed to be partners. What's yours is ours, but what's mine is. Well, you know, I don't have money like you. Don't be ridiculous. God, why are you being so cheap? Stormed off. I figured she needed time to cool down. Nope. Next day, she told her whole family I was financially abusing her by asking for a prenup. Her mom, Deedee, called, screaming, how dare you insult my daughter like this? I asked for a standard prenup. That's not an insult. She's giving you the best years of her life. She's 28, not 80. And I'm giving her mine, too. A real man doesn't need contracts with his wife. Click. She hung up on me. Bianca came back that evening, acting like nothing happened. Started showing me centerpiece options. We need to resolve the prenup thing first. I said. There's nothing to resolve. I'm not signing it now. Roses or peonies? Bianca, I'm serious. So am I. Drop it or there won't be a wedding. Okay, good. So, peonies? Sure, whatever you want. She smiled, thinking she'd won. Started talking about napkin colors and chair sashes. I smiled and nodded, but went bed thinking. Woke up knowing exactly what I had to do the next morning. I started making calls. Not dramatic ones, just practical ones. First, the venue explained I needed to cancel due to irreconcilable differences that have Emerged. They were surprisingly cool. Apparently this happens more than you'd think. Got 60% of my deposit back since it was over 120 days out. Next, the caterer. Same story. 50% back. Photographer actually gave me 100% back because he'd already booked another wedding for that date at a higher rate. Solid dude. Bam and florist. Everyone one by one, quietly canceled. Didn't tell Bianca. Didn't tell anyone except my best friend Marcus, who thought I was either genius or insane. Meanwhile, Bianca was in full bridezilla mode. Created a wedding Instagram, posted daily about becoming Mrs. My last name, and can't wait to marry my provider. Yeah, that post told me everything.

So I was living with this girl, Megan, who I thought was my friend. We'd known each other since freshman year. And when she said she found this perfect apartment and wanted me to sign the lease with her, I jumped at it. Five months of splitting everything, 50 50, doing dishes like good little roommates, never fighting over anything. Then one random Tuesday, I get this text while I'm at my job at the campus bookstore. Hey, we need to talk when you get home. That's never good, right? So I'm driving back thinking maybe she wants to talk about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper or something stupid like that. But when I walk in, she's sitting on our couch with this weird serious face she starts with. So I've been thinking and I already know I'm screwed. She tells me she doesn't think living together is working out and that she already talked to our landlord about me moving out by January 1st. I'm just sitting there like, what the hell? Because we literally never fought. I paid my half of everything on time. I cleaned up after myself and I even bought all the good stuff for our place. But she's acting like I'm some nightmare roommate who's been making her life miserable. I don't argue because honestly, why would I want to live with someone who doesn't want me there? So I tell her, fine, I'll start looking for a new place. She seems relieved like she was expecting me to throw a fit or something. That night I'm lying in bed thinking about how I need to pack everything and that's when it hits me. I look around our apartment and realize I bought literally everything that makes it nice. 50 inch TV mounted on the wall. Mine, the leather couch were always watching Netflix on. I saved up three paychecks for that thing. The coffee maker, the good plates instead of paper ones, the router for our internet, even the freaking shower curtain. Next morning I tell Megan I'll be taking all my stuff when I move out. She just says, okay, like it's no big deal. I don't think she really thought about what that meant. I spent the next two weeks apartment hunting and found this decent one bedroom across town. On moving day, I rented one of those big U Haul trucks because I knew I'd need it. Megan wasn't even home, which was probably for the best. I started with the obvious stuff like my clothes and my desk. Then I unplugged the TV and carefully took it down from the wall. I wrapped up the coffee maker, packed all the dishes I'd bought from target and loaded the couch onto the truck with help from my buddy Jake. The router was the last thing I grabbed. I unpacked all the Ethernet cables and took The whole setup. As I'm walking out with it, I realised she's going to have zero internet until she gets her own. But here's the thing that really made me laugh. When I was packing up the kitchen stuff, I realised I'd bought all the cooking supplies too, the pans, the good knife set, even the can opener. I left her with basically nothing except a mini fridge and some random cups she had from high school. By the time I finished loading everything, the apartment looked like nobody had ever lived there, just empty rooms with some random junk scattered around that wasn't worth taking. I drive to my new place. Feeling pretty good about myself. I'm unpacking when my phone starts blowing up. First it's texts, then calls. Megan is absolutely losing it. What the hell did you do to the apartment? She screams. When I finally pick up, it's completely empty. I tell her calmly that I took everything I paid for, just like I said I would. She she starts yelling about how she looks like an idiot because her friends were supposed to come over that night and now there's nowhere to sit and nothing to watch. You can't just take everything, she says. How am I supposed to explain this? I remind her that she literally said okay when I told her I was taking my stuff. She hangs up on me.

But she didn't know I'd had a vasectomy last year. When Amanda told me she was pregnant, I should have been thrilled. Instead, my blood ran cold. See, 18 months ago, after a pregnancy scare with my ex. Got a vasectomy. Amanda had no idea. She immediately started house hunting, sending me listings for 800 k homes. Way above our budget. The baby needs a yard, Matthew. We can't raise a family in this apartment. Her voice had this urgent, almost desperate edge I'd never heard before. I played along perfectly. Nodded at open houses, discussed mortgage rates, even met with realtors. But I was really gathering evidence. Something felt off about her sudden pregnancy announcement. Immediate push for home ownership. I remembered her work conference nine weeks ago, the exact conception window. Checked her Instagram from that weekend. Every photo featured her coworker Luke. His arm around her, intimate smiles. Definitely not just colleagues. They looked way too comfortable together. The more I dug, the worse it got. I found receipts for romantic dinners during that conference. Weekend hotel charges for room service for two, even a spa booking for couples massage. She documented her entire affair without realizing it. For seven months. I was the perfect supportive boyfriend. Went to doctor appointments where I watched her lie to medical professionals. Helped. And the baby shower? Picking out decorations while she texted Luke constantly. Even picked Out paint colors for the nursery, pretending to be excited about becoming a father. During this time, Amanda ramped up the house pressure. She scheduled multiple tours every weekend, each property more expensive than the last. Her parents got involved, offering to co sign loans. She had me meet with financial advisors about stretching our budget. The manipulation was masterful. I started noticing Luke everywhere. He'd show up at our grocery store, our coffee shop, even our gym. Amanda always acted surprised to see him, but I could tell these weren't coincidences. They were meeting regularly, probably planning their future together. With my money. The pregnancy progressed, and so did her demands. She wanted a house in the best school district, with a finished basement for a playroom and a three car garage. Every conversation became about our future family's needs. She he tear up, talking about wanting to give our child the best life possible. She even dragged my parents into it. Called them crying about how worried she was about raising a baby in our small apartment. Showed them listings of beautiful homes with white picket fences. My mom started pressuring me, too, saying I needed to step up and provide for my growing family. The baby shower was packed. Entire family, our friends, co workers, including Luke, who looked nervous the whole time. He kept checking his phone, avoiding eye contact with me. Amanda was glowing, playing the perfect expectant mother role. I'd prepared everything carefully, made Copies of my vasectomy records, printed screenshots of her social media. Even had photos from the private investigator I'd hired. But I only needed one piece of evidence for maximum impact.

What do you mean? I gripped the door handle instinctively. Briggs had been on the force for 15 years and was supposed to be showing me the ropes. He had gray streaks in his hair and eyes that never seemed to blink. Don't worry. If you listen to every word I say, you'll walk out of this alive. He pulled the patrol car into a rundown neighborhood on the east side of town. Broken street lights and boarded windows made everything look abandoned. My training officer at the academy had warned me about Briggs but said he was one of the best cops on the force. Now I was starting to wonder what best meant. Briggs parked in front of a house that looked worse than the others, paint peeling off like dead skin, front steps rotting through. The kind of place where bad things happened and cops were too scared to show up. He turned to me with those unblinking eyes. Turn off your body cam. It wasn't a request. Why would I do that? My hand moved protectively to the camera on my chest. We're not supposed to ask questions, rookie. Just do it. His voice had an edge that made me comply. I pressed the button and watch the red light go dark. Everything we'd Learned in training said this was wrong. Body cams were for our Protection. In the publics, but Briggs was my partner and I needed this job. The student loans weren't going to pay themselves. Got out of the car and approached the house. Briggs moved like a predator stalking prey. Every step calculated, every movement deliberate. He pulled out his service weapon and I copied him, even though we hadn't knocked or announced ourselves. Turn off your safety and be ready for anything, he whispered it like we were already in danger. I clicked the safety off with sweaty fingers. This felt wrong, but Briggs had 15 years of experience. Maybe this was how real police work happened. Maybe the Amy was just theory and this was practice. My heart was pounding so hard, I was sure anyone inside could hear it. Briggs didn't knock. He just raised his boot and kicked the door in. It splintered inward with a crack and we rushed inside where everything was pitch black. No lights, no sounds, just darkness so thick it felt alive. The smell hit me first, mold and something else. My eyes tried to adjust, but there was nothing to see, just shapes that might have been furniture or might have been people. Riggs gestured for us to split up, which went against everything I'd Learned, but I was too scared to argue. I went left while he went right. My gun was shaking in my hands as I felt along the wall. Each step on the creaky floor sounded like an announcement. Here I am. Come get me. My breathing was too loud in the silence. Then Briggs screamed. Not a shout or a call for backup, a full throated scream of terror that made me cream. I ran toward the sound, bouncing off walls and tripping over things in the dark. His voice came from somewhere ahead, still screaming. Right there, shoot, shoot. Now I saw movement in the darkness. Shape.

I worked at McDonald's for three years and discovered the real reason the ice cream machine is always broken. It's not broken. It's rarely actually broken. It's a combination of deliberately terrible design, corporate contracts, and employees who've given up fighting a system designed to fail. But one summer, I decided to become the ice cream vigilante my store needed. And it nearly got me fired. The Taylor C602 ice cream machine is a nightmare. Wrapped in stainless steel, it's four hours to clean, and if you mess up even one step, it locks you out completely. The cleaning cycle must be done daily. But here's the kicker. It can only be done by someone trained on that specific machine. The training takes eight hours and cost the franchise owner $600 per employee. Most horses train one, maybe two people. So when Jeremy, our only trained ice cream technician, quit to focus on his Soundcloud career, our machine became permanently broken. The owner, Mister Chen, refused to pay for more training. Just tell customers it's broken, he said. Soft serve has the lowest profit margin anyway. For two months, I watched disappointed kids press their faces against the window, watching other people get ice cream at the Dairy Queen across the street. I watched elderly customers who driven specifically for a cone leave empty handed. One regular missus Patterson, came every Sunday for a vanilla cone after church. She'd stopped coming Altogether, I decided to fix this. I found the C602 manual online, all 296 pages of it. I studied it like my life depended on it. I watched YouTube videos of rogue McDonald's employees demonstrating the cleaning cycle. I Learned that Taylor, the manufacturer, had created a monopoly where only their technicians could repair the machines, charging franchises thousands for simple fixes. I started coming in three hours early, unpaid, to practice the cleaning cycle. The machine was like a puzzle designed by someone who hated both puzzles and people. 23 steps each with sub steps. If the milk temperature was off by 1 degree, it would fail. If you pressed buttons in the wrong sequence, it would lock. If Mercury was in retrograde, it would probably fail just to spite you. After two weeks of practice, I mastered it. I started running the cleaning cycle every night after my shift. The machine was actually working, ready to dispense ice cream. But I couldn't tell anyone because I wasn't certified. If corporate found out, Mr. Chen would be fined. So I got creative. I started accidentally leaving the machine on after my secret cleaning sessions. When customers asked for ice cream, I'd say, oh, weird, let me check. Looks like it's actually working right now. Lucky you. Word spread that our machine mysteriously worked during my shifts. Sales increased. Missus Patterson returned, saying she prayed for the machine to be fixed and crediting divine intervention. Kids would cheer when they Saw me behind the counter. I became known as the Ice Cream Whisperer. But success drew attention. The district manager, Patricia, arrived for a surprise inspection. She saw the machine working and asked who'd been maintaining it. Mister Chen panicked and said it must be maintaining itself. Patricia wasn't stupid. She pulled the maintenance logs from the machine's computer. Every cleaning cycle was time stamped at 2:00am, three hours before opening, logged under manual override. Someone's been performing unauthorized maintenance, she announced. This violates our Taylor service agreement. She started reviewing security footage. There I was, night after night, reading the manual by phone, flashlight, while navigating the machine's psychotic cleaning process. Mister Chen looked at me with a mixture of anger and confusion. You could have damaged equipment worth $30,000, Patricia said. You're not sir

The courtroom erupted until I stood, handed the judge a two page document and said, check again. Judge simply looked at my wife and burst out laughing. My name is James, and three months ago I caught my wife Lauren cheating with her yoga instructor. Filed for divorce immediately thinking she'd hit the Jackpot. Since we've been married for five years, Lauren strutted into that Phoenix courtroom wearing a two thousand dollar dress I'd bought her. Confident as hell. Her lawyer was already calculating his commission on what they thought would be a four million dollar payout for my construction business and dad's inheritance. The whole courtroom was packed. Lauren had actually invited some of her friends to watch what she called James's comeuppance. She been telling everyone for weeks how she was about to become independently wealthy. Your honor, her attorney announced, adjusting his expensive tie, missus Peterson deserves substantial compensation for supporting her husband's career growth during their five year marriage. Lauren actually winked at me from across the room. She thought I was just some heartbroken guy who'd roll over and pay whatever she demanded. Her friends in the gallery were practically grinning, waiting for the show. But here's what Lauren didn't know. Six months before I caught her cheating, I'd started noticing weird charges on our joint credit card. Expensive dinners at restaurants I'd never been to, hotel rooms, Booked during girls trips that didn't add up. Designer lingerie purchases that never made it home. The final straw was when I found an eight hundred dollar charge at a jewelry store downtown. When I asked Lauren about it, she said she'd bought herself a birthday present. Problem was, her birthday wasn't for four months. So I hired a private investigator named Frank. Best $5,000 I ever spent. Frank followed Lauren for six weeks. What he discovered was worse than I imagined. The yoga instructor was just the latest in a long line of affair. There was also her personal trainer, a bartender from her favorite restaurant, and even one of my own business partners. Lauren had been using our joint accounts to fund these relationships. Expensive gifts, romantic getaways. Been paying for her affairs, gym memberships. She'd blown through nearly $50,000 of our money over two years. The two page document I handed Judge Ramirez wasn't financial records, with Frank's detailed investigation report proving Lauren had been having multiple affairs for over two years, complete with time stamped photos, hotel receipts, restaurant bills, and screenshots of explicit text messages. In Arizona, adultery doesn't automatically disqualify you from alimony. But it sure does when you've been systematically draining marital assets to fund your affairs. It's called waste of marital property, and it's a big deal in divorce court. The judge read the first page slowly, his eyebrows climbing higher with each line. Flip to page 2. Study the photos and Then burst out laughing so hard his glasses nearly fell off. Missus Peterson, he said, trying to compose himself, not only are you getting nothing from this divorce, but according to this evidence, you owe your husband $47,000 for systematic misuse of marital funds. Lauren's face went from smug to confused to horrified in about three seconds flat. Her friends in the gallery started whisper frantically. One of them actually got up and left. Her lawyer immediately started packing his briefcase, clearly realizing this case had just become a career nightmare instead of a payday. Furthermore, Judge Ramirez continued, given the extensive documentation of financial misconduct, Mrs. Peterson will be responsible for all legal fees incurred by both parties. That meant Lauren owed an additional $23,000 in attorney costs. As we left the courtroom, I overheard Lauren frantically calling someone on her phone, mom, I need to move back in.

My brother Jake was getting married to this girl who seemed super sweet at first. She was all smiles and hugs whenever I was around. But when it came time to pick bridesmaid dresses, her true colors started showing. She wanted everyone to wear this specific coral pink dress that cost $800, not including alterations. I'm a college student working part time at a coffee shop, making barely enough to cover my rent and ramen noodles. $800 might as well have been 8,000. I politely told her I couldn't afford it and asked if there was maybe a cheaper option or if I could get something similar in the same color. She literally laughed at me and said if I couldn't afford to be in her wedding, maybe I shouldn't be in it at all. But then she quickly backtracked when she realized how that sounded and suggested I could just borrow money from my parents. Here's the thing, my parents died in a car accident when I was 17. Jake knew this. His fiance knew this. I've been on my own since then, working my way through school with student loans and whatever jobs I could find. I explained my situation again, thinking maybe she forgot. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic and that everyone has to make sacrifices for weddings. Then she suggested I could sell some of my stuff or pick up Extra shifts to make it happen. I was already working 30 hours a week on top of full time classes. I had nothing left to sell except my laptop, which I needed for school and my car, which I needed to get to work. The whole thing made me feel like absolute garbage. Jake wasn't much better. When I went to him for help, he said his fiance was just stressed about wedding planning and that I should try to understand. He offered to lend me the money, but I'd have to pay him back within six months with interest because they were saving for a house. Interest from my own brother, for a dress I'd wear once to watch him marry someone who clearly thought I was beneath her. That's when I realised this wasn't really about the money. It was about respect. She could have easily picked a less expensive dress or worked with everyone's budgets. Instead, she chose to make it a test of who really wanted to be there for her special day. I told Jake I couldn't make it work and wouldn't be in the wedding party. He got angry and said I was being selfish and trying to ruin his big day. His fiance jumped in and said she wasn't surprised because I'd always been jealous of their relationship and was probably looking for an excuse to cause drama. The whole thing blew up. Jake said if I couldn't support him as a bridesmaid. Then maybe I shouldn't come at all. I said fine, and didn't go to the wedding. I spent that Saturday working a double shift at the coffee shop, making the money I would have blown on a dress I'd never wear again.

I'm 27 years old and my boyfriend Jake is 33. We've been together for almost two years now, and honestly, marriage is probably in our future, but we're not rushing it. Here's the thing, though. My mom still treats me like I'm some teenager sneaking around behind her back whenever we visit my parents. She makes this huge deal about us not sleeping in the same bed, like we're gonna corrupt her precious house or something. We're adults who live together and pay our own, but apparently that doesn't matter to her. She acts like we're gonna start making out at the dinner table if we share a room. This past summer, Jake suggested we just get a hotel room so we could actually be comfortable and not deal with her weird rules. You would have thought we told her we were starting a meth lab in her basement. She went completely insane about it, kept going on and on about how disrespectful we were and how we embarrassed her in front of the neighbors because someone might see us going to the hotel together. She literally made me promise not to do that again like I was 8 years old asking for permission to have a sleepover. I felt so stupid agreeing to it, but I didn't want the drama. So when Christmas planning came around, Jake's parents invited us to visit them in Mexico. They retired there a few years ago and they're super chill people. We decided to go because honestly, it sounded amazing beach weather in December while everyone back home is freezing their asses off. Yes, please. But here's where I got a little sneaky. We didn't tell my parents we weren't coming home for Christmas. When my mom asked me at Thanksgiving if I was gonna keep my promise about not getting a hotel, I told her the truth that I wouldn't be staying at any hotel when we visited them, which was technically true since we weren't visiting them at all. So there I was sitting on this gorgeous balcony overlooking the Caribbean, drinking coffee and watching the sunrise when I made the mistake of checking Facebook. My mom and sisters had posted all this passive aggressive stuff about how hurt they were that I lied to them and how selfish I was for abandoning the family on Christmas. I was feeling pretty good from the vacation drinks the night before because I decided to respond. I told them it was ridiculous that they expected me to follow teenager rules in my late 20s and that I technically kept my promise since I wasn't staying at any hotel during our visit to them. Then I said if they were gonna air our family business on Facebook for everyone to see, I just avoid visits altogether from now on. Well, that got people talking.

My husband ambushed me during our 5th anniversary dinner and said, Kelly, I've been thinking. We need to evolve past possessiveness and jealousy. We are mature adults and we should be exploring connections without restrictions. Being so possessive isn't healthy. He showed me articles on his phone about polyamory. Actually trying to mask his request like some morally good decision. I looked at the engraved watch hidden in my purse, his anniversary gift. Asked him, you want an open marriage? His eyes lit up like Christmas, even though I hadn't agreed yet. Yes. See? You get it. Most wives would get controlling and insecure, but you understand that love multiplies. I pushed the gift deeper into my purse. Alright, no possessiveness, no restrictions. Let's transcend. Little did he know that I was about to transcend his entire existence. I downloaded dating apps that very night while he watched stamelessly grinning about our journey to enlightenment. Within hours, I'd matched with Doug, his gym buddy, who messaged me finally. Been waiting respectfully for years. And then I matched with Axel, his department director, who wrote, I always admired your brilliance at company events. Dinner tonight. When Doug's name flashed on my phone at breakfast, his coffee mug froze midair. Wait, is that my Doug? My workout partner? He's not your Doug, I said, typing back. That would be possessive, remember? But I see him every Morning at the gym. And now I'll see him for dinner. Isn't expanding connections beautiful? His face went through five different shades of panic. You can't date Doug. We spot each other. We're gym brothers. Brothers? That sounds like toxic, masculine possession to me. The orchid arrangement from Axel arrived Tuesday with a card. Extraordinary. Evening, Jay. My husband had already opened it when I got home. My boss is sending you flowers. He's very thoughtful. He asked me about our arrangement in the partner's meeting. In front of everyone. Asked how I felt about sharing my wife. Do you know how humiliating that was? No, I don't. Then came his mother's garden party that Saturday, which was pure chaos. I brought Nathan, a surgeon I'd met that week. Mom, Dad, this is Kelly's friend. My husband started. Boyfriend, I corrected. This is my boyfriend, Nathan. His mother's champagne glass trembled. Your what? Nathan, my boyfriend, your son, introduced me to ethical non monogamy. He says jealousy is just insecurity. She turned to him with eyes blazing in anger. You said what? Mom, it's not like that. It's exactly like that, I said cheerfully. He explained that monogamy is social conditioning. We're both free to explore. Actually, he even encouraged me to bring Nathan today, normalize our lifestyle. His father pulled him aside immediately. Son, have you lost your goddamn mind? While Nathan charmed the garden club ladies, I heard his mother telling her sister to look up intervention specialists. It was amazing watching my husband already start to regret his choice. But it wasn't the end yet. When I got dressed for another date in the dress he bought me for Christmas, he watched from the doorway. Where are you going now? Doug got us into that jazz club you've been wait listing for months. How? I've been trying since January. He knows the owner. See, multiple partners means expanded social access. Love multiplies, just like you said. The next morning, while I confirmed plans with Axel for his yacht club event, my husband was spiraling. Kelly, this isn't what I envisioned. I thought maybe coffee with strangers occasionally. Not you. Dating my boss and my

So I invited him to family dinner. My fiance, Rebecca, really picked the worst time to call me paranoid about her ex, Nate. We were literally sitting there tasting wedding cakes when she brought it up. She kept insisting they were just friends now and I was being controlling. The thing was, I'd come home early from a work trip last week and saw his car leaving our apartment complex at 2:00am. She had no idea I'd seen it. Every time his name popped up on her phone, she'd flip it face down real quick. When she called me insecure again, I decided to call her bluff. You're right. I'm being unfair. Let's invite Nate to your parents anniversary dinner next week, I said. I watched all the color drain from her face. She tried to backtrack and her family wouldn't want extra guests at their special dinner, but I pushed harder. I'll call him myself to show I trust you. She was trapped and we both knew it. She agreed, but her hands were literally shaking. That night I called Nate and made sure to put him on speaker so Rebecca could hear everything. I told him I wanted to apologize for being the jealous boyfriend and invited him to the family dinner. Rebecca just sat there watching me, completely stuck, tried to turn me down, said it wasn't a good idea. But I kept Pushing, telling him Rebecca really wanted him there. I even offered to pick him up myself, you know, to show there were no hard feelings. When I picked him up that night, the guy was sweating through his dress shirt during the drive. He mentioned Rebecca's parents hated him but wouldn't tell me why. We walked into that dinner together and I swear the whole room just froze. Rebecca's mom dropped her wine glass and it shattered all over the floor. Her dad's face went from normal to purple in about two seconds. What is he doing here? He practically growled. I played innocent and explained I'd invited Rebecca's friend to make peace. Her sister actually laughed out loud. Friends after what he did to her. Right then Rebecca's phone lit up on the table. A text from Nate popped up on the screen. This was a mistake. We should be more careful. Everyone saw it. Her sister snatched the phone before Rebecca could grab it. More messages were right there on the lock screen. Meeting times last night was amazing. And what looked like photos being sent back and forth. Her dad jumped up so fast his chair fell backwards. You're seeing him again. Nate was already heading for the door. Rebecca ran after him, begging him to wait. That's when her family just exploded. Her mom started telling me how Nate had cheated on Rebecca years ago with her own roommate. He'd lied about it for six months. Straight. The whole family had been there for Rebecca through that nightmare of a breakup. And now she was sneaking around with him again. Two months before our wedding, Rebecca came back inside with her makeup running down her face. Her family looked at her like she was a stranger. They telling me story after story about what Nate had put her through. How could you invite him here, Rebecca screamed at me. I stayed calm and reminded her that she told me he was harmless. What was wrong with inviting a friend to dinner? Her family wouldn't stop listing all the terrible things Nate had done, the cheating, the constant lies, how he'd completely vanished after destroying her life. Her sister was still scrolling through the phone, showing everyone more evidence. Hotel bookings from last.

Four years later, I found them in our bed three days before our wedding. My fiance Jessica, and her stepbrother, Braden. She didn't even try to explain. Just looked at me and said, I love him. Her engagement ring was still on. While she held his hand, Braden smirked. Sorry, man. It just happened. Her parents had married two years ago. That night, Jessica posted photos with Braden like nothing happened. Changed her relationship status. While our wedding vendors were still calling me. I had to cancel everything alone. The venue, the flowers, the honeymoon. Each call was humiliation. The hotel manager asked, is the bride okay? I couldn't even answer. But I turned that rage into purpose. Studied for the bar exam like my life depended on it. Passed first try, got hired as a paralegal at a family law firm. My job? Research custody cases and find evidence. My boss said I had unusual drive. I had unusual motivation. While I Learned every detail about custody battles and what makes a parent unfit. Jessica and Braden played house, had a daughter, posted family photos online. Their parents barely visited, but they insisted their love was worth it. I became the firm's best researcher. The paralegal who found evidence that won cases. Lawyers requested me for their hardest custody battles. I knew exactly what judges looked for, what evidence mattered, how to prove someone was lying about being A good parent. Three years in, I was the go to person for impossible cases. I turned my pain into expertise. While Jessica and Braden raised their daughter, I became an expert at determining who deserved to keep their kids. Life has a strange sense of humor. Four years later, Braden walked into my firm. I was in the conference room, and I heard his voice at reception, desperate. Explaining how Jessica wanted full custody of their daughter. My boss knocked. Can you handle this case? Do the research? I almost said no. Then curiosity one. Braden looked destroyed. Didn't recognize me at first. I changed. Lost weight, expensive suit, different hairstyle. He was too focused on his problem. She's saying I'm an unfit father, that our relationship was wrong from the start. Then he really looked at me. His face went white. Your. Oh, god. Started to leave, but my boss insisted. Please sit. We're here to help. Braden slumped back down, kept glancing at me while explaining Jessica had cheated with her trainer, now wanted their daughter. Was telling the court Braden wasn't a good father, that their relationship had been unhealthy. The irony was perfect. She'd left me for him. Now she was leaving him and trying to take their child. My boss assured Braden, we take the case. Braden didn't realize I'd be building the entire case, finding every piece of evidence that would determine if he kept his daughter. I spent three weeks investigating, found Jessica's texts to friends bragging about her trainer. Discovered she'd been leaving their daughter with babysitters constantly. Located witnesses who saw Braden at every school event while Jessica was at the gym. Built a file proving who the real parent was. At the custody hearing, I sat at the lawyer's table organizing evidence. Jessica walked in, confident. Until she saw me. Her face went pale. She grabbed her lawyer's arm, whispering frantically. The judge noticed her panic. For two hours, I handed my boss every document.

I'm 27 years old and my boyfriend Jake is 33. We've been together for almost two years now, and honestly, marriage is probably in our future, but we're not rushing it. Here's the thing, though. My mom still treats me like I'm some teenager sneaking around behind her back whenever we visit my parents. She makes this huge deal about us not sleeping in the same bed, like we're gonna corrupt her precious house or something. We're adults who live together and pay our own, but apparently that doesn't matter to her. She acts like we're gonna start making out at the dinner table if we share a room. This past summer, Jake suggested we just get a hotel room so we could actually be comfortable and not deal with her weird rules. You would have thought we told her we were starting a meth lab in her basement. She went completely insane about it, kept going on and on about how disrespectful we were and how we embarrassed her in front of the neighbors because someone might see us going to the hotel together. She literally made me promise not to do that again like I was 8 years old asking for permission to have a sleepover. I felt so stupid agreeing to it, but I didn't want the drama. So when Christmas planning came around, Jake's parents invited us to visit them in Mexico. They retired there a few years ago and they're super chill people. We decided to go because honestly, it sounded amazing beach weather in December while everyone back home is freezing their asses off. Yes, please. But here's where I got a little sneaky. We didn't tell my parents we weren't coming home for Christmas. When my mom asked me at Thanksgiving if I was gonna keep my promise about not getting a hotel, I told her the truth that I wouldn't be staying at any hotel when we visited them, which was technically true since we weren't visiting them at all. So there I was sitting on this gorgeous balcony overlooking the Caribbean, drinking coffee and watching the sunrise when I made the mistake of checking Facebook. My mom and sisters had posted all this passive aggressive stuff about how hurt they were that I lied to them and how selfish I was for abandoning the family on Christmas. I was feeling pretty good from the vacation drinks the night before because I decided to respond. I told them it was ridiculous that they expected me to follow teenager rules in my late 20s and that I technically kept my promise since I wasn't staying at any hotel during our visit to them. Then I said if they were gonna air our family business on Facebook for everyone to see, I just avoid visits altogether from now on. Well, that got people talking. Some of their friends, Started commenting, asking why they were trying to control their adult daughter's sleeping arrangements. Others were saying stuff like maybe there's a reason she didn't want to come home. My family looked pretty stupid, honestly. They deleted the post pretty quick after that, but the damage was done.

Why is she suddenly concerned about my finances? My girlfriend Sarah has this thing where she constantly calls me cheap. Not in a mean way, supposedly. Always with a giggle, always just teasing. But it happens constantly. Every dinner out, let me guess, you're calculating the tip to the penny again. Every gift I buy her. Wow, big spend under over here. When I suggest cooking instead of ordering take out, there's my frugal boyfriend. When I use a coupon, god, you're so cheap. It's embarrassing. It started small, maybe once a week, but over our 8 months together there it became her go to joke about me. Her friends knew me as the cheap boyfriend. Her sister would ask if I was letting Sarah buy anything expensive. The breaking point was last Tuesday at her friend Jessica's birthday dinner. Eight of us at this trendy steakhouse. When the server asked if we wanted to split the check evenly, I said sure. Sarah immediately jumped in with, oh, no, he'll want to calculate exactly what he ate. Meet my boyfriend, the human calculator. Everyone laughed. I smiled and nodded like always. But something snapped inside me. Wednesday morning, I opened a separate checking account. If I'm so cheap, might as well lean into it. That afternoon, Sarah texted wanting to grab Starbucks. I met her there, ordered myself a venti caramel macchiato, got her a tall Black coffee, no additions. Why'd you get me the small size? She asked, confused. Well, since I'm famously cheap, I figured you'd prefer to upgrade your own order. She laughed awkwardly, thinking I was joking. Back Thursday, we went to dinner at our usual Mexican place. When the check came, $47, 83, I pulled out my phone calculator, put it exactly down the middle, put down 2390 twos. You're seriously calculating it to the cent, she asked. Just being true to my nature, I said cheerfully. You always say I'm cheap. Friday, she texted saying she was short on gas money. Hint, hint. Usually I'd Venmo her $30 without thinking. Instead, I replied, sorry, babe, you know how cheap I am. Can't spare it. She called immediately, are you being serious right now? Dead serious. I'm embracing who you say I am. Saturday, she wanted to see the new Marvel movie. I bought one ticket online, showed up to meet her at the theater. Where's my ticket, she asked. Oh, I didn't buy you one. That would be generous. And generous isn't really my brand, remember? She stood there stunned while I walked into the theater. Got 17 texts during the previews. Sunday morning, she came over with breakfast sandwiches, set one in front of me expectantly. Thanks for thinking of me, I said, but I can't accept this. Letting someone else pay for my food wouldn't be very cheap of me. She slammed her hand on the counter. Okay. Enough. This is insane. You're taking my jokes way too seriously. I sipped my coffee calmly. Jokes, Sarah, you've called me cheap literally hundreds of times in front of your friends, your family, strangers at restaurants. I didn't mean it like that. How did you mean it then when you introduced me to your co workers as the guy who splits appetizers? When you told the Uber driver I'd probably ask for a receipt, her face was getting red. Those were jokes. Were they, though? Because you seem pretty committed to the bit. Monday, she tried a different approach, suggested we go grocery shopping together.

But I've been deployed for 8 months. Who's baby? I'm staring at my phone at 3 a. M. In Afghanistan. My girlfriend tiara just posted this elaborate pregnancy announcement on Instagram. Pink balloons, professional photos, the works. Caption read finally pregnant 3 months along. Time to lock this idiot down. Military wifey why she baby on board? He doesn't know yet. I did the math, then did it again. I've been deployed for 8 months. Last time I was home was January. It's now September. 3 months pregnant means she conceived in June when I was 5,000 miles away eating MREs. I typed one comment who's baby? What happened next was bib. Her phone started going insane, comments flooding in, people doing the same math I did. Screenshot spreading everywhere. She tried to delete the post, but it kept glitching, failing while people kept screenshotting. Within an hour I had 73 DMs from mutual friends. My mom was calling at 3 a. M. Her time. But the best part Tiara's mom commented before the deletion so Proud. Derek will be such a good father. Derek not my name, I'm Evan. Then tiara went live fake crying about being a deployment widow and how I abandoned her. She slipped up again. Derek I mean in therapy has helped me realize, someone commented therapists don't usually father their patients babies, hon. She ended the live immediately. Then my neighbor Derek, the guy I asked to check on Her messaged me bro, what did you expect? I was there when you weren't. Do the right thing and let her go. PS she's moving in with me. The audacity was unreal. This unemployed dude living off my deployed girlfriend wants me to do the right thing. I screenshot everything and send it to everyone we know. But wait, it gets worse. Tiara's mom called my mom at 4:00am. My mom recorded the whole thing. Your son needs to accept responsibility. For what? He's been deployed for 8 months. For abandoning tiara. She had needs. Baby needs support from its real father, Derek. But Evan makes more money. Military pays well. Derek's between jobs. Between jobs? This dude's been unemployed the whole time? Then came the legal threats. Some sketchy lawyer emailed my military account demanding monthly support payments for emotional distress. Half my house value. I bought it before we met. Continued health insurance, $10,000 for baby supplies, A written apology for public humiliation. My JAG lawyer laughed until he cried. She wants military benefits while pregnant with another man's baby. This is comedy gold. But the peak entitlement happened next. Tiara made a TikTok crying in her car, the one I was still paying insurance on, talking about deployment abuse and started hashtag dash deployment widow. The comments destroyed her. Ma'am, he's literally commenting from Afghanistan. Deploy. I meant widow. He's very much alive. Imagine telling your kid daddy was deployed when you were conceived. Then I got Emergency leave approved. First, stop changing my locks. Tiara had been living in my house with Eric. I walked in to find Eric's clothes in my closet, his gaming setup in my office, sound photos on my fridge, and a future Mr. And Mrs. Morrison sign in the living room. Morrison? Derek's last name. While packing their stuff, I found Tiara's pregnancy journal. One entry made my blood boil. Derek says we should wait until Evans deployed longer so he can't contest anything. Military guys get screwed in court. This baby will secure the bag. Then they came home. Derek went white seeing me. Bro, I can explain. Get out of my house. Tiara started her performance. Babe

Then I saw the group photo. All of them, on a private beach in Maui. I stared at my phone in disbelief. My entire family had ditched my wedding for a vacation. The caption read, finally together. Like I didn't exist. But here's what they didn't know. For years, I've been quietly bankrolling their lifestyle. The family business cards all linked to my accounts. Your mortgage co signs my credit. The lake house, utilities, auto pay from my bank. I've been the invisible ATM, funding their perfect lives while they whispered that my wife wasn't their kind of people. So I sent one text back. Perfect timing. Then I called my attorney. Within an hour, I'd cut off every shared account, canceled every auto payment, and revoked access to everything. The secondary property my sister lived in. She was using my credit for the rate. Not anymore. It started small. Day 3, the dealership called about a bounced car lease. Day 5, the office building sent late rent warnings. By week 2, the group chat was pure your chaos. Can someone cover the lakehouse utilities? My card got declined for Scottsdale. Does the company still cover insurance? They were scrambling, but still no apology. Just confusion about why their money fountain suddenly only dried up. Then my sister called. First time since the wedding. Not congratulations or sorry we missed it. Just, you can't do this to us. I didn't even answer, just blocked the number. But the real fun was just beginning. See, I'd forgotten about one little detail. My dad's precious boat. The 40 foot yacht he loved showing off at the Marina every weekend. Guess whose name was on the insurance policy? Week three. 3, I got a call from the Marina. Sir, your boat insurance was declined for non payment. We need it removed by Friday or it gets impounded. I could have warned him. Should have, maybe. Instead, I drove to the Marina Thursday night with my wife and a bottle of champagne. We sat on the dock and watched them tow away Dad's pride and joy. My wife raised her glass. To new beginnings. Too expensive lessons. I replied. The group chat exploded. The next morning, my aunt was practically screaming in all caps, the boat is gone! Who didn't pay the insurance had called me 17 times. I let every single one go to voicemail. Each message got more desperate. Son, please call me back. There's been some mistake. We can work this out. Work what out? That they skipped my wedding for cocktails on a beach? Then my mom tried a different approach. She showed up at my office unannounced, tears streaming down her face. Security called up to ask if I wanted to see her. Tell her I'm in Maui, I said. The security guard paused. Sir, she says she's your mother. Not anymore. But the nuclear option came. When my uncle called, Uncle Rick, the family mediator, the guy who always smooth things over at Thanksgiving, his voice was shaking. Your father's having chest pains. The stress is killing him. You need to stop this. Funny, I said I had chest pains, too. Right around the time I saw 40 people. I love choosing a vacation over the most important.

When I was 17, my whole world was shattered with six words. You'll never be my real daughter. Warren had raised me since I was five, been to every school play, taught me to ride a bike. But during a fight about college applications, when I mentioned wanting to study culinary arts instead of business like his biological kids, his mask finally slipped. Fiona and Kevin would never disappoint me like this. But then again, there actually mine, he said, his voice cold. Fiona and Kevin were his biological children, and he had always treated us differently. I saw the truth in his eyes that day. 12 years of playing dad, and I was still just his wife's baggage to him. That's when something crystallized in me. I wasn't going to beg for his approval anymore. Instead, I'd become so undeniably successful that his rejection would become his loss. I started documenting everything I cooked, building a portfolio, and entering every competition I could find. While Warren boasted about Fiona's MCAT scores and Kevin's internships at family dinners, I quietly applied for apprenticeships at Michelin star restaurants. When I got accepted to train under a James Beard Award winner in New York, I didn't even tell him. Mom knew, but I asked her to keep it quiet. I want to focus on my craft, I said. Though, really, I just couldn't bear To hear him diminish this, too. For three years, I disappeared into the culinary world. I worked six teen hour days with burns up my arms, screaming chefs in my ears, all while sleeping in a shared apartment. I worked my way up from prep cook to line cook to sous chef, each position more demanding than the last. Meanwhile, Warren would send mom photos from Fiona's white coat ceremony and Kevin's graduation, never once asking how I was doing. During rare video calls with my mom, he'd be in the background, occasionally throwing in comments like, still playing with food, or, Fiona just published her first research paper. As if I needed the comparison, I started developing my own style. Fusion techniques combining molecular gastronomy with comfort food. Things that caught the attention of food critics. When a famous food magazine wanted to do a feature on rising young chefs, I almost said no, afraid that Warren would see it and ridicule me even further. But my mentor convinced me by saying, cook for yourself. That article LED to me opening my own restaurant and feeding more than 300 people every single day. Then one day, I got an invitation to Fiona's engagement party. I almost and go. But then I realized I wasn't the weak girl scared of her stepdad's judgment anymore. So I went and arrived fashionably late. Fiona spotted me, and her face lit up like Christmas. Oh, my god, Lena! Kevin rushed in behind her. It's so nice to see you. They hadn't seen me in two years. We saw the article about your restaurant opening. Kevin said, that's so cool. Fiona grabbed my hands. My friend ate there last week. She couldn't stop raving about it. Said it was transformative.

I can't be your mom anymore. I need to find myself. What mom didn't know was that I'd thank her for this one day. It was exactly one year since dad died, and she'd promised we'd visit his grave together. I'd saved my allowance for three weeks to buy yellow roses, his favorites, and stayed up late making cookies for him, like he taught me before the accident. I made sure to remind mom about it. Remember, we have to visit Dad's grave before we go to my birthday party, okay? My mom smiled, reassured me that she was all packed and ready to go. I found out exactly what she meant by ready to go. On the morning of my 12th birthday, I woke up to find her car was already gone from the driveway, and her room was cleared out of all her belongings, leaving behind nothing but a note. I didn't shed a tear. I just walked. The cemetery was three miles from the house, but I went anyway, carrying a tin of cookies and a grocery store bouquet. My feet were sore and had busted calluses by the time I got there, but nothing hurt more than losing both my parents on my birthday, just one year apart from each other. One by accident, one by choice. So while I sat there sobbing on the stone, my dad's best friend, Joel Walked up and sat beside me in the MUD. We sat there talking about my dad for a while. All the good memories we had. Then he asked the question I had hoped he wouldn't. Did you walk here? By the way, where's your mom? He asked, pointing to my worn out shoes. She's not coming, I told him. As calm as a 12 year old could be at that moment. Joel nodded. How about you stay with me and my wife for the night? I have a daughter, Ava, who could use a friend tonight, too. I didn't even nod, just followed him back to the car, silently staring out the window. And while they took me in, it wasn't always the easiest. I stayed in my room most of the time, hiding away, thinking I was a burden. They'd eventually leave, too. Ava was the first to melt down my walls. She spent every morning braiding my hair before we went to school, something mom never bothered to do, even when dad was around. Their Thursday family game nights were bizarre to me at first because nobody screamed when they lost or threw the board across the room like mom always did. Joel's wife L helped me with homework, saying some things take more effort than others. Plus, I never really liked math, so I don't blame you. But just as things were getting better, I saw something that broke me all over again. My mom had posted A photo of herself at the beach, captioned, no regrets living for me and my happiness. I just lost it completely. Joel heard me sobbing and came in. Didn't say anything, just held me while I sobbed and ranted. Then he drove me to the hospital. Your dad and I used to come here when things got hard, he said, leading me through the children's ward. Helping these kids reminded us why we became doctors. We spent the night reading stories to kids who couldn't sleep, bringing juice boxes to worried parents, watching Joel work his magic turning scared faces into smiles. We were so busy helping people who had it worse that I eventually forgot about mom. We kept going back every week. I Learned every kid's name, their favorite colors, and in the middle of it all, I finally felt a sense of belonging and direction. I told Joel on the way back home, I want to be a doctor, too. His eyes grew wide, smiling proudly at me. Your dad would love that. Medical school flew by with Joel bringing me to Dad's grave after every semester to share my grades. I quickly forgot about mom, even unfriending her so I wouldn't see her posts about exploring yourself in your

Marry for love, please, my mom said, rolling her eyes. That's just B S. That Disney shows have been promoting since the 30s. Your mother is right. You need to face reality. Dad agreed while reading through his newspapers. Marry bridge is transactional. You either choose stability or choose stupidity. They continue to compare my struggling artist boyfriend to their friend's successful heart surgeon son. For years, I defended him, but it was futile. When I turned 26, my parents gave me an ultimatum. Continue dating my boyfriend or get cut off from the family completely. That meant no more help paying off student loans, phone plans, car insurance, everything. I loved my boyfriend, but neither of us could afford to live without my parents support. So we broke up mutually. And I started dating Jacob, the surgeon. Now, don't get me wrong, he's a gentleman. Perfect on paper, in every way. Rich, pretty, attractive, and great with his hands. You know, as a surgeon. We quickly got engaged, and my parents were thrilled, bragging to everyone about how they got their daughter to break up with her bad boyfriend and listen to them. But, boy, were they going to regret it. You see, Jacob had only one flaw. He was a mama's boy. And unfortunately, his mama, Mildred, was worse than mine. So when Jacob moved in with us, she did, too, taking Over my parents master bedroom, saying that they always slept together again. Not in that way. But that was just the start of things. Mildred had other quirks. She constantly complained about my mom's cooking, making sure it was perfect for her little Jacob. She cut down dad's rose bush to keep a safe environment for her baby boy. Within a month, she managed to redecorate the entire house from soft and elegant to leopard print and gold. Throwing out all the antiques because it was depressing. Of course. Everything was ordered using my parents credit card. Because we're family now, and family share. And then came the seven emotional support Chihuahuas that chewed on the sofa, barked constantly, and enjoyed biting and growling at my dad. And the best part of it all was the fact that Jacob refused to stand up to her. Even when it was clear on his face that he was tired of her craziness too. When my parents tried talking to him about it all, he told them, the moment you disagree, she'll terminate the engagement. Is that what you want? By the exhausted looks on their faces, they weren't even sure anymore. But then it happened. Mildred's ultimate 65th birthday bash. Spectacular at our house. Without permission or even so much as a warning. My parents came home to find 200 strangers destroying the house. Kids ran around with markers, drawing on the walls and furniture, while their parents spilled food and drinks. All over the hardwood floor. One couple got hot and steamy in my parents'room. There's raided mom and dad's jewelry, stuffing their pockets. The entire place was worse than any frat house party I'd seen. While they looked for Mildred, one of the seven Chihuahuas latched onto my dad's leg. He shook his leg around, yelling for help, but was quickly surrounded by other dancing men in the mix. With dad distracted, mom went on the hunt for Mildred. And stopped dead in her tracks when she spotted a teenager cutting the strings to her precious piano, the only thing that ever gave her happiness. She broke down sobbing. The house was destroyed by the time the party ended. Stains everywhere, broken furniture. And for perfectionist parents, oh, it was a sight to behold. And Mildred already snuck out for her month long cruise, leaving my parents to deal with the mess she'd made. Because we're family. And that's when I saw it. Regret plastered on their faces. My parents broke down in front of me, sobbing. You need to break up with him immediately. We'll pay for everything. We'll help you get your boyfriend back. We'll apologize to him ourselves.

My daughter's fourth grade teacher told her class that blood is blue inside your body and only turns red when it hits oxygen. Lily came home repeating this fact while showing me her veins. I gently explained, that's actually not true. Blood is always red because of hemoglobin, just darker red in veins. She looked at me confused, but Missus Wilson showed us a whole Powerpoint about it. Dad. She even had diagrams from a science book. Next morning, I packed my work scrubs in my bag. I'm an ER nurse at Mercy General and I was working the three PM shift. Anyway, I sent Missus Wilson an email asking if I could do a quick 15 minute presentation about blood for Career Day that afternoon. She loved the idea. When I arrived, Missus Wilson introduced me as Lily's dad, who works at the hospital. Twenty eight kids stared up at me from their desks, covered in Lisa Frank folders and Minecraft pencil cases. I heard you guys Learned that blood is blue inside your body, I said. The entire class nodded enthusiastically. Missus Wilson beamed from her desk. I pulled out a vacutainer blood collection tube from my pocket. This is what we use to draw blood at the hospital. Notice something? I held it up. The tube creates a vacuum. No oxygen inside at all. Missus Wilson smile started fading as I explained. When we Draw blood with these. It never touches oxygen until we pop the cap off. But I showed photos on my phone of sealed blood tubes. See? Still red. The kids were fascinated. I showed them medical textbook pages on my tablet. Missus Wilson kept clearing her throat, her face getting redder than the blood samples on my screen. But our textbook says it's blue, one boy argued, pointing to their science book. I walked over and checked the publication date. 1998. Medicine Updates pretty fast, I explained. We used to think lots of things that turned out to be wrong. Missus Wilson suddenly stood up. Well, thank you for that interesting presentation, Mister. Johnson, but we need to move on to math now. I nodded and started packing up when a girl raised her hand. So our textbook is wrong? The class erupted in whispers. Missus Wilson's voice got tight. The curriculum says. Actually, I interrupted, pulling up the state science standards on my phone, the current curriculum specifically mentions this myth as something to correct. I showed her the screen. That's when she asked me to step in to the hallway. The kids watched wide eyed as the door closed behind us. Do you have any idea how hard it is to teach these kids when parents undermine my authority? She hissed. Now they'll question everything I say. I kept my voice calm. Isn't that exactly what we want them to do? Question things and learn critical thinking? I've Been teaching for 22 years, she snapped. I'm not changing my whole curriculum because some nurse thinks he knows better than our textbooks. That night, Lily asked me if she was in trouble because Missus Wilson kept giving her mean looks all afternoon. I assured her she wasn't. The next day, Missus Wilson announced a pop quiz with questions like what color is blood inside the body? Lily answered red and got marked wrong. She came home crying with a big red F. I requested a meeting with the principal and brought printouts of medical tech

Aria was the girl who'd throw any girl under the bus for five seconds of male approval. Since freshman year, everyone knew Aria as the girl who'd loudly announce she only hung out with guys because girls are too much drama. She'd sit at the guys table, laugh at every sexist joke louder than anyone else, and somehow convinced herself that calling other girls too sensitive made her so. The crazy part was the guys ate it up. Even teachers thought Aria was refreshingly laid back compared to other girls. I remember this one time in PE when a girl complained about the boys snapping girls bra straps. Aria actually stood up and said it's just guys being guys, stop being such a baby about it. The male coach literally thanked her for being rational. That was Aria's whole thing. She was the cool girl who got it. She'd brag about watching porn with the guys, rate other girls bodies with them, and called feminism victim mentality. Girls who tried to call out inappropriate behavior became her targets. He'd mock them with fake crying sounds, post their complaints on social media to ridicule them, and loudly proclaim how she wasn't like those uptight bitches who couldn't take a joke. During junior year, when Natalie reported getting groped at a party, Aria was the first to say Natalie was probably asking for it. Wearing that dress, the guys would high Five her. Call her basically a dude with tits, and she'd beam like she'd won the lottery. When we all came back on Monday after spring break of senior year, we were preparing for the moment. Aria went off on a girl and snickered with one of her guy friends. But first period arrives, and Aria walks past the guy table without even glancing at them. Not like avoiding them. Aria just walked past like they didn't exist. She sits down at a table full of girls, the same girls she'd spent three years mocking. Vivian, who she'd called a dramatic princess. Dre, who she'd labeled attention seeking for reporting harassment. Natalie, whose reputation she'd tried to destroy. The guys started calling her over. Yo, Aria, we saved your spot. She didn't even turn her head. It was like she'd gone deaf to male voices. At first, everyone thought it was some weird joke. Maybe she lost a bet over spring break. Maybe this was some elaborate prank that would turn into the ultimate pick me moment. We were on the edge of our seat, waiting for her to burst out yelling, I was right. Girls are too much drama. But Aria kept sitting with the girls. She stopped responding to the guys texts, unfollowed all of them on every platform. When Ethan tried to talk to her after chemistry, she looked right through him and kept walking. Days turned into weeks. Guys went from confused to angry. They started Spreading rumors that Aria was on her period, that she turned into a crazy feminist overnight, that she was probably a lesbian now. They tried everything to get a reaction. Nothing. Aria just kept sitting with the girls, actually listening when they talked, not interrupting to defend male behavior. The girls were suspicious at first. This had to be some long con to gather gossip for the boys. But Aria never brought up the guys, never defended them. When Jade mentioned feeling uncomfortable about something her boyfriend said, Aria actually responded with, that's not okay. You deserve better. Everyone's jaws broke the floor. Then we all found out what happened, and it was so much worse than anyone imagined. Audrey revealed what she'd heard from her older brother, who went to college with Ethan's brother.

In the video, my husband and my son were with her, and my son was hugging her, saying he wished she could be his mother. I stared at my phone in complete shock, watching my eight year old tell another woman he wanted her as his mom. My birthday cake sat untouched on the in counter. 32 candles melted into colorful puddles of wax. The balloons I'd hung that morning mocked me from the ceiling. Instead of crying like the old me would have done, I did something that would change everything forever. I called my lawyer first. Jennifer, it's Paisley. I need those divorce papers we discussed last month. Tonight. I don't care what time it is, Paisley. It's almost 10 p m. What the hell happened? He's been secretly taking Ethan to see his ex girlfriend Marisa behind my back for months. I have video proof of everything. Jesus. I'll have the papers ready by morning. Then I called my bank's emergency hotline. Account freeze, credit cards canceled immediately. The joint savings we'd carefully built over 10 years of marriage locked down tighter than Fort Knox. By the time Marcus finally walked through our front door at midnight, smelling like her perfume, I had already filed for emergency custody, called a locksmith to change every lock in the house, and methodically packed All his belonging into black garbage bags lined up by the front door like a funeral procession. Hey, babe, sorry we're so ridiculously late tonight, he said casually, fumbling with his house key that no longer worked. Little Ethan fell asleep in the car again. He finally looked up from his phone and saw the divorce papers spread across our coffee table like evidence at a crime scene. How was your wonderful day with Marisa? I asked, my voice steady and cold as winter ice. His face went completely white. The color drained so fast I genuinely thought he might collapse and faint right there. Paisley, sweetheart, I can explain everything. It's really not what you think it is. Save your explanations for the judge tomorrow morning. You're officially served. I handed him the thick custody papers with trembling hands. His fingers shook violently as he read the emergency restraining order. Our son Ethan appeared in the doorway, rubbing his sleepy eyes, still wearing the expensive new jacket I'd never seen before in my life. Mom, what's happening? Why are all of Dad's sitting outside in bags? Your father forgot it was my birthday today, honey. But he certainly remembered to take you to see his ex girlfriend instead. Ethan's little face crumpled with confusion. She said she was just Dad's old friend from college. She bought me ice cream and told me. What exactly did she tell you, baby? That maybe someday we could all live together like one. Big, happy family. Marcus grabbed my arm desperately, his grip almost painful. You can't just destroy and tear our entire family apart over this one thing. I already did. Now the courts will decide who Ethan really belongs with. His confident smirk, the same one he'd worn for years whenever I questioned his suspicious late nights, vanished completely when he realized I wasn't the same naive woman who used to wait up for him every single night with dinner warming in the oven. Paisley, please be reasonable. We can work this whole thing out between us. Marissa honestly means absolutely nothing to me. I pulled out my phone and played the damming video again. Really? Because she apparently has

The moment he walked through the door, the entire hallway went silent. Active shooter drill, everyone. Someone shouted, and half the students hit the floor while the others laughed. Killian just kept walking while people filmed him. By lunch, there were already three different TikTok box of him. They found pipe bombs in his locker. My friend Alex told me my brother was here when it happened. Said Killian had a whole hit list and escape routes. The teachers weren't subtle, either. During attendance, Mr. Williams made Killian stand up and empty his backpack for random security check. When Killian pulled out a calculator in AP Physics. This is a Kring. Actually flinched. The security guard followed him between every single class. Parents had already started a petition to remove him, which had 800 signatures by second period. But I started noticing things that didn't add up. Killian left granola bars on the desk of this kid whose parents couldn't afford lunch money. When some sophomores were destroying a special needs kids art project, Killian stepped between them. He tutored ESL students after school in the library. He carried tampons in his backpack because the school never restock the bathroom. Girls would slip him notes, he'd slip them back supplies. But nobody ever thanked him. They just took what they needed and went back to posting about how much Of a monster he was. It all shifted the day I stayed late for drama rehearsal. It was 6 p m. School was empty except for theater kids in the auditorium. I went out the back exit for fresh air and saw Mister Rayner, our AP history teacher, walking with Lacey, a freshman from my bus. They were heading toward the parking lot, and something about how she was walking, shoulders hunched, arms wrapped around herself made my stomach twist. I got up to them and hid behind the bushes to listen. You need extra tutoring at my house. I heard Mister Rayner tell her. Your grades really need special attention. Lacey looked terrified. I should call my mom. I already told her you'd be staying late for academic help. His hand was on her lower back, pushing her toward his car. She was thrilled. You're getting personal assistance. I was about to pull out my phone, but that's when Killian appeared from behind the dumpsters. Lacey, your mom's here to pick you up, he said calmly. She's in the front lot. Mister Rayner's face went dark. Miss Killian, Lacy's with me. We have a scheduled session. No, you don't! Killian stepped between them. Lacy, go to the front. Your mom's in the blue Honda. Lacy ran. She goddamn sprinted. Mr. Rayner grabbed Killian's shoulder. You have no idea what you're interfering with. I've been helping struggling students for fifteen years. Private tutoring, academic support. Principal Davies knows all about My methods? I know exactly what your methods are. Killian said. I've been documenting them for two years. You. Rayner laughed. School shooter. Who's going to believe you? He walked away. Which is when I finally stepped out. The next day, Killian and I went to Principal Davies. We told him everything we saw. But he leaned back in his chair and smiled. Mr. Rayner is our most decorated teacher. Thirty year veteran, coach of the year. His private tutoring has helped hundreds of struggling students. He looked at Killian. You're a convicted criminal who planned to murder children. And now you're stalking our best teacher. Then he turned to me. And you're believing a school shooter over a man who shaped young minds for decades? I think you both need psychological evaluation. He picked up his phone. Security, I need Killian escorted off campus. He's having delusions again. Killian stood up slowly. How many kids, Davies? How many kids did you send to his house knowing what he was? Get out before I call your Parole officer. That night, someone posted AI generated photo

When my son was 11, his school bus crashed, and his neck was whiplashed so hard that his airway was crushed. The doctors told us he would recover, but he might never speak again. But this didn't stop his younger sister, Rosie, from talking his ear off. Nathan would listen, smile, or even text responses back. Usually she's okay with that, but one time, when she came home from a bad day at school, she immediately ran to Nathan, and when he just patted her back in response, she whispered, I just wish you could tell me it'll be okay. Nathan spent a lot more time alone after that, and whenever I walked into his room to check on him, he would asleep under the covers. I figured it was just soccer practice tiring him out. And then came Rosie's seventh birthday party. Right after she blew out the candles, Nathan lifted his hand up and the room went silent. I was confused because this was usually something he did when something was wrong, but everything seemed fine. He then took a deep breath, his face turned red, and spoke the words, happy Birthday, Rosie. Me and Rosie both burst into tears before grabbing him for a big hug. And that's when I realized all those nights he spent alone, he was forcing out sounds and pushing through the pain, all for this moment. Rosie was Jumping up and down like she was on a trampoline and repeating the words. Nathan, you talked. You really talked. Nathan just smiled. His voice still raw, but his eyes brighter than I've seen in years. Because for the first time since the accident, he wasn't just listening. He was heard.

But what he said instead destroyed my life. Until I found his secret. Jake got down on one knee at my company Christmas party. Everyone started recording, thinking it was the perfect proposal. Instead, he looked me in the eyes and said, I can't marry someone who's been cheating on me with my best friend. Then he walked out, leaving me standing there, humiliated.

My neighbor has six kids and I've never met a single one. The first time they left one of their blackout curtains open, I caught sight of all six sitting around the kitchen table eating just chicken and rice while the parents were eating a Turkey dinner. I tried to tell myself it was just a new parenting trend. But over the next few weeks, I started noticing other things. The house was always quiet, not a peep. When I tried to make friendly neighbor conversation with the parents, I'd give one word answers and hurry inside. My best friend said I needed to stop being nosy. Some families are private, she said. Remember the rednecks? They were weird, but their kids turned out fine. But I'd raised three kids of my own and nothing about that house felt fine. It was 2 a. M. When my dog started barking at something outside. I jumped to the window and saw all six kids marching in their backyard like tiny soldiers. The father stood watching with his arms crossed while the mother blew a sharp whistle that made them all freeze again. Do it again until it's perfect, the father barked. The children immediately resumed their positions and started over. When one of the smaller ones stumbled, all six had to start again from the beginning. The next night, I deliberately stayed up to watch. Sure enough, 2:00am came and there they were. Again, this time doing jumping jacks in unison while quietly chanting something I couldn't make out. It sounded like the American Pledge of allegiance but distorted. The youngest couldn't have been older than 5 years old. Struggling to keep up, exhausted, I started paying closer attention to anyone who might have seen these kids, which is when the Amazon delivery driver whispered to me, those kids scat. They're like roaches when the porch light comes on. Never seen anything like it. A quick search online showed the parents weren't registered as homeschoolers in our state. Despite the kids never leaving the house, I started documenting everything with my phone. One night, I caught them all doing wall sits against the house at 3 a. M, their legs shaking from exhaustion while the mother timed them with a stopwatch. The next morning, I followed their grocery delivery to see what they were feeding these exhausted children. The shopkeeper noticed me watching and said they order the exact same thing every week, 40 pounds of rice, cases of protein powder and beans. Nothing a kid would want. That Tuesday, I was ready with my camera when I saw headlights approaching the it's filed into the white van silently. The license plate was conveniently covered with MUD. I sat on my kitchen floor for two hours while on hold with 9 1 1 until the van returned. Each child walked out wearing a different outfit than before, looking dazed. The youngest was limping. One boy had fresh bruises on his legs that weren't there before. I took a photo of each of their faces and breathed a sigh of relief. I finally had enough evidence to call CPS. They picked up on the 11th ring. I need someone to check on the family now next door. I think these children are being abused. There was a long pause. Ma'am, we've already done three home visits on that house. They're just a strict family. Please stop calling or we'll have to report you for harassment. Well, I was done asking for permission. I waited until I saw the parents leave one morning and snuck into their backyard. The garage side door was unlocked. My heart hammered so hard I could hear it in my ears. But those kids needed someone to fight for them. I pushed the door open and stepped inside.

I thought I was imagining things at first. Me and my girlfriend Rachel were sitting on the living room floor with 10 month old Emma trying to get her to say anything. You know how it is with babies. You make all those stupid faces and weird sounds hoping they'll copy you. Rachel was doing the classic mama, mama, mama thing while waving her hands around like a complete maniac. I was on the other side doing my best dad voice going Dada, Dada, come on, sweetie. Emma just sat there in her little pink onesie chewing on her fingers and staring at us like we were the biggest idiots on the planet, which let's be honest, we probably were. Then my phone buzzed with another YouTube notification. I've been binge watching this tech review channel all week and apparently I'd forgotten to turn off notifications. Without thinking, I grabbed my phone and set out. God, I need to unsubscribe from this guy. Emma's head snapped toward me. Her eyes went wide. Then clear as day she looked right at me and said unsubscribe. Perfect pronunciation, three syllables like she'd been practicing. Rachel stopped mid mama and stared. I dropped my phone. We both looked at Emma who had this huge grin on her face like she knew she'd just blown our minds. She clapped her little hands together and said it again, unsubscribe. Pediatrician told us it was Perfectly normal. Kids pick up whatever words they hear most often. And apparently I've been saying unsubscribe way more than either Mama or Dada. That week, Rachel was not happy. She kept giving me these dirty looks like it was somehow my fault our daughter's first word was a YouTube feature instead of something sweet and meaningful. But here's where it gets weird. Emma became obsessed with that word. She he'd crawl around the house saying unsubscribe to everything, the cat, her toys, the TV. When she was hungry, instead of crying, she'd look at her empty bottle and say unsubscribe like she was canceling her milk subscription. Two weeks later, I'm at target with Emma in the cart. He's being super good, just sitting there playing with her little stuffed elephant. Then this random lady walks up, you know the type, the one who thinks every baby in public belongs to everyone. She starts making baby talk at Emma, doing that high pitched voice thing. Oh, what a cute little girl. Can you say hi to me, sweetie? Can you wave? Emma looks at this lady for a second, tilts her head and then says in the clearest voice ever, unsubscribe. Lady's face went from sweet grandma mode to completely confused. She looked at me like I'd taught my baby to curse at strangers. I just shrugged and said she's very selective about her content. But the real kicker came last month. Rachel's mom was over for dinner and She's always been one of those people who thinks she knows better than everyone about everything. She kept trying to feed Emma these organic baby food pouches that cost like $5 each, going on and on about how regular baby food is full of chemicals and we're poisoning our child. Emma was in her high chair, completely ignoring the fancy organic carrot puree her grandma was trying to shove in her mouth. She kept turning her head away and making this annoyed face. Finally, after about 10 minutes of this back and forth, Emma looked her grandma dead in the eye and said, unsubscribe. With the most serious expression I've ever seen on a baby. Rachel's mom stopped mid spoon and asked what she said. Emma said it again, louder this time, unsubscribe. I started laughing so hard I almost choked on my pasta. Rachel was trying not to laugh, but I could see her shoulders shaking. Her mom looked absolutely mortified, like Emma had just told her to get lost in the rudest way possible, which honestly, she kind of had. Emma had figured out that unsubscribe meant I don't want this anymore and she was using it to opt out of situations she didn't like. It was actually brilliant.

In the video, my husband and my son were with her. And my son was hugging her, saying he wished she could be his mother. I stared at my phone in complete shock, watching my eight year old tell another woman he wanted her as his mom. My birthday cake sat untouched on the kitchen counter. Thirty two candles melted into colorful puddles of wax. The balloons I'd hung that morning mocked me from the ceiling. Instead of crying like the old me I've done, I did something that would change everything forever. I called my lawyer first. Jennifer, it's Paisley. I need those divorce papers we discussed last month. Tonight. I don't care what time it is, Paisley. It's almost ten PM. What the hell happened? He. I've been secretly taking Ethan to see his ex girlfriend Marisa behind my back for months. I have video proof of everything. Jesus. I'll have the papers ready by morning. Then I called my bank's emergency hotline. Account freeze, credit cards canceled immediately. The joint savings we'd carefully built over 10 years of marriage locked down tighter than Fort Knox. By the time Marcus finally walked through our front door at midnight, smelling like her perfume, I had already filed for emergency custody, called a locksmith, change every lock in the house, and methodically packed all His belongings into black garbage bags lined up by the front door like a funeral procession. Hey, babe, sorry so ridiculously late tonight, he said casually, fumbling with his house key that no longer worked. Little Ethan fell asleep in the car again. He finally looked up from his phone and saw the divorce papers spread across our coffee table like evidence at a crime scene. How was your wonderful day with Marissa? I asked, voice steady and cold as winter ice. His face went completely white. The color drained so fast I genuinely thought he might collapse and faint right there. Paisley, sweetheart, I can explain everything. It's really not what you think it is. Save your explanations for the judge tomorrow morning. You're officially served. I handed him the thick custody papers with trembling hands. His fingers shook violently as he read the emergency restraining order. Our son Ethan appeared in the doorway, rubbing his sleepy eyes, still wearing the expensive new jacket I'd never seen before in my life. Mom, what's happening? Why are all of Dad's sitting outside in bags? Your father forgot it was my birthday today, honey. But he certainly remembered to take you to see his ex girlfriend instead. Ethan's little face crumpled with confusion. She said she was just Dad's old friend from college. She bought me ice cream and told me. What exactly did she tell you, baby? That maybe someday we could all live together like one big happy family. Marcus grabbed my arm desperately, his grip almost painful. You can't just destroy and tear our entire family apart over this one thing. I already did. Now the courts will decide who Ethan really belongs with. His confident smirk, the same one he'd worn for years whenever I questioned his suspicious late nights, vanished completely when he realized I wasn't the same naive woman who used to wait up for him every single night with dinner warming in the oven. Paisley, please be reasonable. We can work this whole thing out between us. Marissa honestly means absolutely nothing to me. I pulled out my phone and played the damming video again. Really? Because she apparently has dozens of videos of you two together going back six months. Beach trips, romantic dinner dates, family photos with my son. How did you even. She sent it by complete accident. Meant to send it to her sis

There's this guy in my neighborhood who started stealing my packages about two months ago. At first I thought it was just bad luck when my new headphones went missing. Then my coffee maker disappeared, then a birthday gift for my mom. After the fourth theft, I started tracking delivery times, obsessively trying to grab packages the second they arrived. But this guy was watching, too. I'd check the delivery notification rush outside, five minutes later, and the package would already be gone. I saw him once. He was in his mid 30s, baseball cap, driving a beat up Toyota Corolla that he'd park one street over before walking to my house. He wasn't even subtle about it. He'd stroll up my driveway in broad daylight like he owned the place. I put up a no trespassing sign. He took that, too. I added a mile you're on camera sign even though I didn't have cameras yet. The next day, that sign was in my recycling bin. That's when things got personal. He started leaving sticky notes on my door after stealing packages. The first one said, thanks for the Bluetooth speaker, sucker, with a smiley face drawn on it. The next time, after taking my workout supplements, he left a note saying, maybe try working out your brain instead. He was taunting me when he stole my girlfriend's anniversary gift. He actually had the nerve to leave a note saying she's too good for someone who can't even protect a package. Nice choice on the earrings though. That one made my blood boil. I tried everything having packages delivered to my work, but my boss shut that down. Amazon lockers were always full. I asked neighbors to grab them, but they were during the day too. The worst part was when he stole my diabetic cat's special food delivery and left a note thanks for the feast, dummy. My cat had to go without his food for 3 days while I waited for a replacement. I was literally trapped. I couldn't order anything to my own home. This guy was controlling my life and he was enjoying every second of it. I finally hit my limit when he stole my grandmother's medication that I'd ordered for her. The note said Hope Granny's not in a rush. Lol that was it. I went to the police station with all the sticky notes as evidence. The officer took my report, said they'd investigate, and told me package theft was unfortunately common. They'd increase patrols, they said. They'd keep an eye out, they said. But we both knew nothing would happen. It was just petty theft to them, a property crime that wasn't worth resources. I went home furious and started researching my options online. My first thought was a glitter bomb or die pack, but then I found forums discussing package Protection. Turns out booby trapping packages is illegal. You can actually get sued or arrested for injuring a thief. Even a harmless glitter bomb could technically be considered assault. I was about to give up when I stumbled across a post from a lawyer explaining that tampering with federal mail is a serious federal crime, not just petty theft. Federal mail includes anything sent through USPS with proper postage. The penalties were severe, up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. That's when my plan started forming. I invested in a high quality security camera system with clear night vision and motion detection, spending nearly $500 I couldn't really afford. I made sure one camera had a perfect angle of my driveway where cars would pass. Then I prepared my trap. I ordered a cheap item from eBay, but specifically requested USPS Priority Mail shipping. When it arrived, I carefully opened it from the bottom, keeping the federal mail label intact and visible. I placed the original

I found out later dad kept a savings account with Marcus's name on it. $10,000 from his Walmart wages for when he comes home. Last month, I was repainting Dad's old shop when a Mercedes pulled up. Marcus stepped out wearing a designer suit, Rolex gleaming. He'd aged badly, the look of someone who'd partied away eight years. Hey, little brother, he said casually. Is dad around? I want to explain everything. Made it big in crypto. Can pay him back with interest. Dad's at Riverside Cemetery, I said flatly. Plot 47B. Been there 14 months. The color drained from his face. When? How? Waiting, I said. He died waiting for you. Set your place at dinner every Sunday for eight years. Forgave you. Before his last breath, Marcus pulled out a check. $1 million. See? I told you I'd make it someday. You built it on his corpse. I said that money was his life's work. You didn't steal money, Marcus. You stole his remaining years. He died a Walmart greeter because of you. Marcus tried pushing past me. This is still his place. It's a coffee shop now. Everything of Dad's is gone. You missed the decline, the pain, the end. You missed your chance to let him die in peace. Instead of wondering what he did wrong as a father, Marcus stood there in his expensive suit, holding his worthless check, finally understanding what his absence had cost. Not money, but the Chance to make peace with the man who loved him by everything. He drove away without visiting the cemetery. Sometimes the cruelest abandonment isn't leaving. It's staying away while someone waits for you to return. Keeping hope alive until their very last breath.

He came back last month, expecting forgiveness. He found out dad died waiting for an apology. The security camera caught everything. Marcus emptying Dad's safe at 3 a m, stuffing $340,000 into a duffel bag. The money dad had Ave for 40 years running his auto shop. Gone in 15 minutes. Dad found the note that morning. I need this more than you do. Don't look for me. The betrayal destroyed something in dad. He had to sell the shop at a loss, move into a one bedroom apartment, and take a job as a Walmart greeter at 71. But watching his golden child become a thief, that killed his spirit. Move back from Denver to help. But every Sunday dinner, dad set Marcus's place at the table. Maybe today, he'd say the empty chair mocked us both. Year one, dad refused to press charges. He's still my son. Year two, he hired a private investigator. The trail went cold in Phoenix. Year 3 brought Dad's first heart attack. In the hospital, he made me promise to tell Marcus he was forgiven. I just want to know why. What did I do wrong raising him? Dad's health declined steadily. Diabetes? Any problems? Another stroke? Sometimes he'd mistake me for Marcus, grab my hand and say, you came back. The hope in his eyes when reality hit was unbearable. Year 7, Dad moved into the hospital. Even on morphine. He'd ask nurses if his son had called. I'd lie and say Marcus was coming. Dad would smile peacefully. He died on a Tuesday morning, still waiting. His last words were about Marcus. Tell him the combination was his birthday. He didn't need to steal.

Two years together, living together for eight months. And that's how she really felt. I quietly set the bags down outside, grabbed my keys, and drove to my buddy Mateo's place. Didn't even go inside to confront her. What was the point? Mateo listened to everything while we sat on his porch drinking beers. Then he said something that changed my perspective completely. Dude, she just saved you from the biggest mistake of your life. Imagine if you'd proposed and found this out after the wedding. He was right. I've been ring shopping for weeks. Actually had an appointment at the jeweler that Saturday to pick out something perfect. Had the whole proposal planned out. Dinner at the restaurant where we had our first date, then a walk through the park where I'd hidden a photographer. The next morning, I went back to get my stuff. Ava was crying. Makeup street to down her face, begging me to stay. I didn't mean it that way. Mom put me on the spot. You know how she gets with her questions. So your real feelings only come out when you think I can't hear them? That's even worse. Ava. But her sister Selena was there, too, visiting from college for spring break. She pulled me aside while Ava was in the bathroom and whispered. She said the exact same thing about her last boyfriend, Xavier. Word for word. I remember because it made me sick then, too.

Took him maybe 30 seconds, and he didn't even seem to try hard. The cops started digging into Derek's background. Turns out he had access to way more than people realized. Every security system he installed came with admin codes that let him disarm everything remotely. And as a locksmith, he was making copies of every key and access code he touched. Here's how smart this guy was. He never hit houses right after working on them. He'd wait months, sometimes half a year, long enough for people to forget he'd ever been there. He'd watch people's social media, figure out when they were going on vacation, then strike when the house was empty. The genius part was combining both jobs. The security systems told him which houses had expensive stuff worth stealing. The locksmith work gave him a way to get in without leaving any trace. And since he installed the security systems himself, he knew exactly how to disable them. They finally caught him because the Chen family had installed a second set of cameras in their baby's room that Derek didn't know about. These were connected to a different system entirely. When he broke in, those cameras caught his face clear as day. When police searched Derek's house, they found a storage unit full of stolen goods and this thick

No contact with family. My sister Tara got a German Shepherd for her 16th birthday. I got a card. The dog's name was Jack's and he cost $3,000 from a champion bloodline. My parents built him a heated dog house that cost more than my car. When Jax bit me the first week, dad said I must have bothered him. Jax killed my childhood cat, peaches, three months later. I'd raised peaches from a kitten bottle, fed her when she was abandoned. I found her lifeless in the backyard one morning. My parents shrugged and said cats were boring anyway, that dogs had personality. They refused to let me bury her properly because it might upset Jax to smell another animal in his yard. I buried peaches at my friend's house and cried alone. I paid for my own college, working three jobs. Sarah dropped out sophomore year to become a dog trainer. She'd never trained Jax to even sit yet. My parents bought her a 40 thousand dollar mobile grooming van for her new career. The business lasted two months. I graduated nursing school with honours. My parents couldn't make it to graduation. Jack's had a vet appointment when Tara's dog turned one. They threw a party with 50 guests. Then Jack's attacked my neighbour's poodle. My parents paid the vet bills and bought Tara a second German Shepherd to keep Jack's company. When I asked for help with my textbooks, mom said, that's My responsibility. The second dog's name was Athena. She was worse than Jack's. Together, they destroyed my childhood bedroom. During Thanksgiving, I found peaches hidden toys under my bed torn to shreds. My parents laughed and said, dogs will be dogs. Everything unraveled when I met Steven. We dated two years before getting engaged. My parents said they were thrilled, but never asked about wedding plans. When I mentioned wedding costs, they suggested courthouse ceremonies were more intimate. At the same time, Tara announced Jack's needed surgery for hip dysplasia. My parents spent $15,000 without blinking. Then Jack's destroyed my wedding dress. During the fitting, Tara had brought him to my appointment uninvited. He jumped on me with muddy paws and tore the train clean off. The dress was ruined beyond repair. Tara laughed and said,

I can give you a family discount, maybe some cost effective menu options. Her voice turned cold. You're being so selfish. This could be amazing exposure for your little business. Think of all the wealthy guests who will see your work the dismissive way. She said, little business made my blood boil. I've catered for senators, celebrities, Fortune 500 company.

Toby's girlfriend Kelsey became social media manager for our B2B company that doesn't even need Instagram. Both making DOLLAR85K annually, by the way. Meanwhile, I'm still maintaining every line of code, updating systems, handling server crashes at 2:00am, and taking my measly 20% cut as the tech guy. Yesterday at four PM. Hey, we held a partners meeting and voted. You're out. The business needs to evolve beyond just tech stuff. Pack your desk. By Friday we'll mail your last check. Thanks for everything. I replied. Okay, then I did what any reasonable person would do. I logged into AWS and revoked every single license key for their software. All of it. The client portal, routing system, inventory management, payment processing, everything. Now it all shows one simple message license expired. Please contact your software administrator. Garrett called me at four seventeen PM, then 4:19, then 4:12. Missed calls by 4:30. I didn't answer any of them. The chaos that followed was honestly better than Netflix. Biggest client had a $400,000 shipment scheduled for the next morning. Without the routing system, they had no idea which drivers were supposed to go where. The inventory system was down, so they couldn't figure out what was supposed to be shipped. Garrett showed up at my apartment at 6 a. M. Pounding on the door like police. I recorded it through my ring doorbell but didn't answer. He screamed for 20 minutes about how I'm being petty and destroying the Family

Mallory tried being sneaky. She reached out to my ex girlfriend on Facebook trying to dig up dirt on me. Told my ex that I was having a mental breakdown and had stolen company property, asking if she noticed any unstable. Well, behavior when we dated. My ex screenshot everything and sent it to me with lol. Your family is insane. Glad you're finally standing up to them. They also tried hiring an emergency IT company to rebuild the entire system. The company came in, looked at what needed to be built, and quoted them $450,000 with a 6 month minimum timeline. Three of their major clients have already started looking for new logistics part partners. Word travels fast in this industry when your systems just disappear overnight. I got a call from dad this morning. Turns out Garrett and Toby had to take out a $200,000 emergency loan just to keep the lights on. They're hemorrhaging money faster than when they first started.

I'm sorry, but professional catering isn't free, I said firmly. She got nasty fast. Fine, whatever. I'll find someone actually good who appreciates the opportunity. That stung more than I expected. Someone actually good? Like my eight years of experience meant nothing. The family got weird after that. Usually Sabrina's wedding would be the topic of every conversation, but suddenly nobody mentioned it. My mom said Sabrina found an amazing caterer who's just just as talented, but wouldn't elaborate. Wedding day arrived. I wasn't invited. Probably punishment for not providing free labor. Honestly, I was relieved. Family weddings are exhausting, full of old grudges and forced small talk. I spent Saturday night actually relaxing for once. Ordered Thai food, opened a good bottle of wine, watch Netflix. First free evening I'd had in months during wedding season. Then Sunday morning at 7 a. M. My phone started buzzing like crazy. Missed calls from Sabrina, her mom, my mom, even my aunt, all starting around 6 a. M. Just rapid fire calling. Something was very wrong. I finally answered when my mom called for the fourth time. Oh, thank god, she said breathlessly. The wedding was a complete disaster. The food gave everyone food poisoning. Half the guests are in the ER. My stomach dropped. What happened? Turns out Sabrina found her better caterer on Craigslist. Some guy named Stanley who quoted $1,200 for 150 people. Even I knew that was impossible. That wouldn't cover basic ingredients. Let alone

Stanley showed up three hours late to the reception venue. No uniform, no professional equipment, just a beat up van filled with grocery store containers. The appetizers were gas station sandwiches cut into triangles. The main course was clearly expired potato salad and room temperature deli meat. The wedding cake was a grocery store sheet cake with congratulations spelled wrong and blue frosting. Within an hour, guests started getting violently ill. The bathrooms were packed. Henry's grandmother had to be rushed to the hospital. The photographer left early because he couldn't stop throwing up. Sabrina was sobbing in her $3,000 dress while paramedics tended to her guests. That's when she started calling me, begging me to somehow save what was left of her reception. When I finally called her back, she was hysterical. Please, I'll pay whatever you want. You bring something. Anything. The reception is ruined. I took a deep breath and said exactly what she'd said to me two months earlier. I'll find someone better. Then I hung up and went back to my Thai food. The aftermath was brutal. Photos spread through our family group chat, Henry looking mortified while Sabrina sobbed over grocery store sandwiches. The venue had to call a hazmat team for the bathrooms. Three couples canceled their honeymoons due to food poisoning. Stanley got Banned from the country club permanently. My business actually boomed after word got out.

So I let them discover who was really paying their bills. I'm 30. Co founder of a tech company near Seattle. My family never understood what I do. They think I repair machinery. For two years, I've been quietly paying my parents utilities. Electricity, water, internet. Nearly $400 every month, totaling nine thousand hundred and forty two, or $17. They never mentioned it, never thanked me. Just accepted it like it was owed. Jessica was always the golden child. While I was responsible and studious, she was beautiful and charismatic, getting anything with a smile in family photos. I was always at the edge, while Jessica took center stage. Three weeks before my mother's birthday, I called to say I'd be coming home early to help with preparations. My father answered, and after hesitation, his voice turned cold. Ryan, maybe don't come home this year. Jessica's bringing her boyfriend. He's a manager, someone important. And your job, it isn't very comfortable to talk about. So it's best if you don't come. What the hell did you just say? You coming home would embarrass the whole family. If you insist on coming, don't call me your father. Then he hung up. I sat there, hands shaking, his words echoing in my head. The same people living off my 400 dollar monthly payments were calling me the family shame. I opened my banking app and stared at That No.. Nine thousand hundred forty two, 17. I scrolled to automatic payments and canceled every single one. Electricity, water, internet. All of it. A week later, my mother texted. Internet Bill is due. Can you take care of it? No mention of what happened, no apology. Just a request to pay. I didn't respond. Two weeks later, my father left a sharp voicemail. Power company called. This month's Bill hasn't been paid. What's going on? Still no acknowledgement. I remained silent until my mother's birthday that afternoon.

They'll be here after you. I packed my bags that night without another word. When she and her squad showed up at my new place days later. She? I'd been with Marissa for over two years. We'd moved in together six months earlier. Split everything down the middle, the whole domestic thing. But lately, I felt like I was dating five people instead of one. Marissa had this tight knit friend group. Chloe, Adrian, Tasha, and Finn, who called themselves the squad. Ironically, they did literally everything together, 24 seven. Group chats, matching Halloween costumes, coordinated social media posts. First I thought it was sweet. Eventually, I started wondering if I was even in a relationship or just some guy who paid half the rent. The pattern had been building for months. My graduation from my master's program. She went to Adrian's housewarming instead. My brother's wedding. She was too exhausted from a three day festival with the squad. When my mom was in the hospital for surgery, Marissa couldn't visit because it conflicted with their weekly game night. But she expected me to drop everything for her needs. Last month, she called me at 2:00am to pick her up from some dive bar because Finn was too drunk to drive. When I got there, she barely acknowledged me. Just kept taking selfies while I stood there like an Uber driver. The worst part was overhearing her phone conversations. I heard Her tell Tasha I was going through a jealous phase and needed to learn to share her time better. Like I was some insecure teenager instead of her partner.

I only found the first camera because I dropped a fork. It slipped under the kitchen cabinet, and when I bent down to grab it, I saw a tiny black dot blinking behind the molding. I stared at it for five seconds straight before it hit me. It was pointed directly at my couch, where I usually nap, sometimes shirtless. I unscrewed the panel and pulled out the camera. It was wireless. Micro lens. No brand. Not something you find at Walmart. I didn't freak out. I got quiet. I live in an old triplex, third floor. My landlord, Dave, lives on the bottom floor. Looks like a guy who eats plain boiled chicken and still sweats. You know the type. Too friendly. Always around, just fixing stuff. No one asked him to. A few weeks before, I caught him in the hallway, just standing there saying he thought he heard a leak. I thought he was just awkward. Turns out he was waiting for me to take my shirt off. So I started searching the apartment. Found a second cam inside the smoke detector above my bed, a third one behind a vent in the bathroom. This man had basically installed a live streaming network of my body without my consent. That's when I stopped being scared and started producing content. I left the cameras exactly where they were, but I changed the script every Morning. I'd start with a routine. I'd stand directly under the camera in the bathroom and talk to it like it was Alexa. Good morning, Dave. Hope you're enjoying the view. Can't wait for you to see the surprise later. Then came the props. I filled my fridge with fake IDS, rubber gloves and syringes filled with dyed water. Took hours to make everything look real. I'd sit on the couch under the kitchen cam, holding a fake burner phone, saying stuff like, yeah, the body's still in the tub, but the acids working slowly. Sometimes I just stare straight into the camera for 30 minutes. No blinking, no moving, just wide eyed, like I was watching him. By week two, I noticed changes. Dave stopped coming upstairs.

My neighbour's dog kept getting into our yard, destroying my wife's garden. She'd spent months growing those flowers after her cancer treatment. It was her therapy, her way of healing from the hell she'd endured. I asked him nicely the first time, he shrugged it off with a dismissive smirk. Second time, he rolled his eyes like I was bothering him. Third time, he told. Told me to build a better fence if you don't like it. By the fifth conversation, he was laughing in my face, saying, dogs will be dogs. Deal with it or move. The final straw came on a Tuesday morning. I found my wife Rachel sitting in the dirt, crying over her destroyed rose bushes. The special hybrid ones she'd planted to celebrate eating stage 3 breast cancer. Six months of careful nurturing, daily watering, protective covers during storms. Gone. Petals scattered everywhere like bloody confetti. She looked up at me with tears streaming and whispered, why would someone let this happen to us? Haven't we been through enough? That's when something dark lit inside me. A switch flipped that I didn't know existed. I spent that entire night researching everything about Brian Miller and that stupid German Shepherd. Social media profiles, property records, business licenses. Turns out the mutt wasn't even registered with the city. No vaccination records, no license, nothing.

Maybe poetry, maybe unsent letters. Doesn't matter. Joe's just part of the morning rhythm, like the squeaky doorbell or the hum of the espresso machine. And then one day, that rhythm got broken. A guy stepped out of a great Tesla, all fake tan and too much Cologne, talking into his phone like it was a mic, designer joggers, those chunky sneakers that cost more than my rent, and sunglasses he never took off. Even inside, he ordered something that wasn't on the menu. A keto friendly cold pressed oat milk frappe with collagen boost, and smiled like he just invented coffee. The barista handed him an iced cold brew with almond milk instead. He rolled his eyes, said, ugh, small towns, and paid in crumpled cash while filming himself complaining about it. He sat by the window with his tripod, adjusted the lighting, and started talking to his phone loud enough for The entire cafe to hear, this town's cute, but it's, like, poor cute.

He was a structural engineer. The kind who measured success by awards, patents, and blueprints signed with his name. I thought maybe if I showed him I was serious about engineering, he'd see me. He didn't look up from his laptop when I carried the bridge into the kitchen. Too many support beams, he muttered. It'll sag under pressure. It didn't. I won first place. I brought home the ribbon and taped it to the fridge. The next morning, it was gone. Mom said she thought it looked messy and put it in the drawer. I never asked her which one, but I kept trying. Robotics club, math league, perfect grades. I took every hard class, skipped parties, stayed in on weekends. He didn't say much, just the occasional that's expected or keep it up. It was like feeding coins into a machine that never paid out. In college, I landed a summer internship with a well known civil firm. I printed the offer letter and left it on his desk. Didn't mention it once. I overheard him later at a barbecue telling a friend she got lucky. They probably just wanted a female intern for their brochure.

Which is why I was confused when the housing office emailed me about a third noise complaint. Something about yelling stop something! And aggressive energy. I live with one person. Trip. That's his real name. And if it sounds like the name of someone who owns a drone and two vape pens, that's because it is. Trip is everything I'm not. Loud, messy, rich, and allergic to consequences. I knocked on his door after the first complaint. He said, bro, I don't care. It's probably just some nerd trying to get us kicked. Okay. Second complaint came after a broken window. Not mine, not my fault. But my name was somehow on the report. So when the third one came, I realized this wasn't a misunderstanding. It was war. And I couldn't afford to lose.

By month three, I was the one initiating contact. By month six, she'd go weeks without responding to photos I'd send. I started keeping records without really planning to. Screenshots of ignored texts, photos of Owen reaching milestones she missed, bank statements showing I was paying for everything from formula to doctor visits. The family made excuses for her. She was finding herself. She was going through a phase. She needed space to heal. Meanwhile, I was learning to function on three hours of sleep, trading my social life for story time and watching my savings disappear into baby expenses.

I sang Happy Birthday to him alone, watching him smash cake into his high chair while trying not to cry. That was 18 months ago. I've been documenting everything. The missed visits, the forgotten birthday, the child support she never sent. Owen called me Mama! And didn't even recognize her voice on the phone. Then Jess landed a marketing job at her boyfriend's startup and suddenly wanted to play Mommy again. She filed for custody, claiming I'd kidnapped her son and she was ready to be a real parent now. Her lawyer painted me as the unstable single woman who'd stolen a baby during a mother's vulnerable moment. That's when I pulled out my phone and played the voicemail she'd left me just last month, completely drunk, laughing about how she'd dodged a bullet by dumping Owen on me and how she'd never wanted kids anyway.

I didn't hold back in court. My cousin Jess was the family princess who could do no wrong. While I worked two jobs through college, she partied her way through a communications degree our aunt paid for. When I graduated with honors, the family dinner conversation was about Jess's new tattoo. When I got my first apartment, they were helping her out of another DUI. The golden child treatment only got worse as we got older. Jess would blow through jobs like tissues, always landing on her feet because someone in the family would make a phone call. She'd crash cars and get new ones. She'd max out credit cards, and somehow the debt would just disappear. When she got pregnant at 22, she acted like it was just an inconvenience. She'd show up at family dinners complaining about morning sickness while chain smoking on the porch. At her baby shower, she spent more time taking selfies with the gifts than actually opening them. I watched her roll her eyes when people gave practical things like diapers and bottles. The pregnancy was rough, but not because of medical issues. I just hated how it cramped her style. She'd call me at midnight crying about how her body was ruined, how her friends were having fun without her, how she felt trapped. I thought it was normal pregnancy anxiety. After baby Owen was born, Jess lasted Exactly three weeks before she cracked. Those three weeks were a disaster. She'd let him cry for hours because she was too tired to get. She forgot to buy formula twice, leaving me scrambling to the store at 2:00am. I'd find dirty diapers stuffed behind furniture because she couldn't be bothered to walk to the trash. The breaking point came when I stopped by unannounced and found Owen screaming in his crib, completely alone. Jess was at a nail appointment she'd forgotten to mention. The baby was soaked, hungry, and had been crying so long his voice was hoarse. She called me that night crying, saying she couldn't handle it anymore and needed just a few days to figure things out. She showed up at my door with a diaper bag half packed with random clothes.

My son scrambled out of bed, throwing himself between us. I lowered the rifle, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. My brain felt like it short circuited. The intruder wasn't hurting him. He was holding him, comforting him. That's when it clicked. This guy wasn't a stranger. He was my son's boyfriend. Apparently, they've been sneaking around for months. My son hadn't told us he was gay, let alone in a relationship. He thought we wouldn't accept it. And his boyfriend, not wanting to get him in trouble, had been sneaking into the house late at night, not realizing anyone else knew. I stood there in silence, rifle in one hand, flashlight in the other, heart still pounding in my ears. My son looked at me, terrified. Not because of the gun, but because he thought I'd hate him for it. I set the rifle down and sat on the edge of his bed. Then I said the only thing I could think of. You're grounded for sneaking someone in. But I'm glad you're safe. And I love you. My daughter was right. There was a man in the house. But she just didn't understand. He wasn't there to hurt anyone.

So I was in 8th grade when this girl, Emma, basically ran our classroom like she was the teacher's assistant. She sat at this special desk right next to Miss Greens and got to do all the stuff teachers usually do collect homework, pass out papers, and watch the class when Miss Green had to step out. Emma wasn't even the smartest kid, but she was the most obedient. She remind everyone about homework every single day and report any problem behavior to Miss Green. If you were talking during Quiet Time, Emma would write your name on the board. If you forgot your pencil, Emma would make this big show of telling the teacher you weren't prepared. Everyone thought she was just being a goody two shoes, but I started noticing weird stuff happening around her. Like when Jessica forgot to turn in her math homework, Emma found it crumpled up in the trash. The next day, when Tyler got three behaviour strikes on the board, somehow one of them got erased overnight. Emma always had explanations. She was just trying to help. Or maybe the janitor accidentally wiped it. But then things got serious. A group of girls in our class were planning this huge sleepover for Kaylee's birthday. They invited almost everyone except Emma. I felt bad for her, but honestly, nobody really wanted to hang out with the class snitch. The Monday after the sleepover, Emma was acting Super weird during recess instead of staying inside.

My seven year old daughter started telling me she was seeing a man walking around our house at night. Every time I just laughed, passing it off as one of those weird things kids say. But every morning she kept repeating the same story. She said she heard someone sneak into our house while we were asleep, that he'd climb in through the living room window, then go upstairs and hurt my son. At first I thought she just had an overactive imagination. I mean, I know if someone was actually breaking in, wouldn't I? Still, something about the way she said it started to creep me out. So that night, I made sure every door and window was locked before heading to bed. I even double check the alarm system and told myself it was just for peace of mind. Around three in the morning, my daughter came running into our bedroom. She was shaking and said, he's here again. This time I didn't brush it off. I grabbed my flashlight and hurried downstairs. Every door was locked, but when I got to the living room window, I pulled on it and it slid open without any resistance. My heart dropped. She wasn't imagining it. Someone had been getting in. I bolted upstairs and grabbed my rifle from the closet, then quietly crept down the hallway toward my son's room. I took a deep breath, pushed open his door, and Aimed into the dark.

Two twins and another one. And from that moment on, I felt like I was getting pushed to the back every single time. He'd cancel our plans if they wanted to do something. Like we'd plan to go hiking together, but then he'd cancel last minute because they wanted to go to some kitty play place. We have movie tickets for something we both liked, but he ditched me to take them to see some cartoon instead. The worst was when I got a ticket to this concert. Me and dad both loved this band. He was supposed to buy his own ticket so we could go together. Then last minute, he tells me he spent the money on paint for one of his stepkids rooms instead. Had to go alone.

When I was 29, I'd already been through this song and dance with doctors like five times. Every time I went in for anything, they'd look at me, see that I was heavy, and blame whatever was wrong on my weight. Headaches, lose weight. Back pain. Lose weight. Weird rash, probably from sweating too much. Lose weight. So when I started getting these crazy chest pains, I already knew what was coming. But these weren't like normal chest pain. They felt like someone was stabbing me right through my sternum with a hot knife. Sharp, sudden, and deep. I'd be sitting there watching TV and suddenly feel like I was being impaled. I went to the ER on a Tuesday night around nine PM. The place was packed. But when you say chest pain, they usually take you back pretty quick. The attending doctor was this middle aged guy who walked in, took one look at me, and I could literally see him making assumptions. He poked my stomach a few times, asked how much I exercised, and said the pain was probably just acid reflux or anxiety from stress eating. I tried to explain that it didn't feel like heartburn at all. This was different. But he was already writing something on his clipboard. He handed me a prescription for antacids and told me to cut back on spicy foods and maybe try Yoga for stress. I didn't even bother filling the prescription. What was the point? They never listen anyway. My roommate Katie was pissed when I told her what happened. She'd been dealing with the same kind of medical bias for years. We both joked about how doctors think being fat is some kind of terminal illness that causes every other symptom in the world.

My husband came home from work last Tuesday with this look on his face that I knew meant trouble. He'd been on the phone with his ex wife all afternoon about Caleb. His 24 year old son. Caleb had overdosed again. Fourth time this year. And this time they found him passed out in some gas station bathroom with a needle still hanging out of his arm. I was making dinner when my husband sat down at the kitchen table and just stared at me. My daughter Emma was upstairs doing homework. Completely unaware of what was about to happen. He cleared his throat and said they needed $30,000 for an impatient rehab program. 60 days. Some fancy place up in the mountains that supposedly had better success rates. I stopped stirring the pasta sauce and turned around $30,000. We'd already blown through almost $14,000 on outpatient programs that didn't work because Caleb either didn't show up or relapsed the second he got out. I'd personally paid a thousand bucks for his first detox thing. Maybe this time would be different. Then my husband paid 6,005 hundred for another program. Then we split another sixty five hundred when Caleb swore on his dead grandmother's grave that he was ready to get clean. But here's the thing about Caleb. He stolen my wedding ring, my mother's jewelry, our TV, Emma's laptop. And even loose change from Emma's piggy bank. The Kid had no problem looking a 15 year old girl in the eye and taking her birthday money. And every time it was the same story. He was sorry. He was gonna change. He just needed one more chance. So when my husband said they wanted to use Emma's college fund, I actually laughed. Not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe he was serious. That money came from Emma's dad, who died when she was six.

I watched Dylan Mercer rule our school for three years. He was untouchable. Wealthy parents who donated to the school, perfect grades, captain of the debate team. And that smile that charmed every teacher. But behind closed doors, he was a monster. I first noticed it sophomore year when my friend Ava came to school with puffy eyes. It's nothing, she insisted, but later confessed. Dylan had spread rumors that she'd slept with the entire baseball team after she rejected him at a party. Why don't you report him? I asked. Are you kidding? His mom is on the school board. Besides, everyone loves him. Her voice cracked. No one would believe me. She was right. Dylan operated in plain sight. He'd trip kids in the hallway, but make it look accidental. He'd borrow answers, then accuse others of cheating. The teachers never suspected a thing. By junior year, I started documenting everything. Small notes in my phone at first. Dates, times, incidents. Then I began recording conversations when he was nearby. It wasn't much, but it was something. The breaking point came during senior year. My best friend Marcus transferred to our school, and Dylan immediately targeted him. It started with harmless jokes about Marcus being gay. Then his gym clothes mysteriously disappeared during PE, his art projects were accidentally damaged. Just ignore him, I suggested. But Marcus's eyes darkened. That's what everyone says. That's why bullies win. One Monday, Marcus didn't show up to school. Then Tuesday. By Wednesday, his mom called me crying. He tried to harm him.

Garde ch√©ri. Tu crois que je partage autre chose avec toi ? Ma s≈ìur m'a attrap√© par le bras. Jackson, calme-toi, calme-toi. Mon fr√®re vient d'annoncer qu'il coche avec ma femme depuis 18 ans, √† ma f√™te de d√©part √† la retraite. Papa √©tait assis dans sa chaise longue, comme s'il avait vieilli de 10 ans. Maman pleurait dans sa salade de pommes de terre. Will s'est essuy√© le visage. On avait jamais voulu que √ßa dure aussi longtemps. 18 ans. Will, 8 ans. Emily nous regarda pour la 1√®re fois. Je le vis, le nez, les yeux. Comment avais-je pu √™tre aussi aveugle ? Ne suis-je vraiment pas ta fille ? Me demande-t-elle. Mon c≈ìur se brisa. Tu seras toujours ma fille, monsieur. La biologie n'y change rien. Mais m√™me en le disant, je savais que tout avait chang√© √† jamais. Will commence √† marcher vers sa voiture. Je te laisse-le temps d'assimiler ce moment. Je le suis. Vie. Tu ne vas nulle part. J'ai attrap√© ses cl√©s, tu as cr√©√© ce d√©sordre, tu vas-y faire face. Mara retrouva enfin sa voix. Jackson, laisse-le partir. Oh ! Alors maintenant tu le prot√®ges devant tout le monde. Tout le monde regardait notre famille implos√©e en temps r√©el. Tante, oncle, cousin, tous t√©moins de la destruction. Will se retourna. Que veux-tu de moi ? Je veux retrouver ma vie. Je veux retrouver ma fille. Je veux retrouver mes 18 ans. Je ne peux pas te donner √ßa, alors donne-moi tout. Le reste. C'est l√† que j'ai compris ce que je devais faire. L'option nucl√©aire. J'ai sorti mon t√©l√©phone et j'ai appel√© mon avocat devant tout le monde. Jackson, j'ai besoin que tu engages 1 proc√©dure de divorce et je veux 1 test ADN, ordonnance du tribunal ce soir. Mara. Halita. Jackson, non. Et je veux savoir s'il y a des comptes joints auxquels Will a eu acc√®s. Le visage de Will. Polly. Qu'insinues-tu ? Je n'insinue rien. Tu m'as vol√© ma vie. Il est temps de voir ce que tu as vol√© d'autres. La f√™te √©tait silencieuse, √† l'exception des sanglots discret de ma m√®re. Emily m'a attrap√© par le bras. Papa, s'il te pla√Æt, ne fais pas √ßa. Faire quoi ? D√©couvrir la v√©rit√© ? Will reculer vers sa voiture. De la folie ? Jackson, non, ai-je dit en lui barrant le passage. C'√©tait fou de faire confiance √† mon fr√®re alors qu'il √©tait en famille. J'ai regard√© les visages autour de moi. Quelqu'un d'autre √©tait au courant. Silence. Ma s≈ìur a finalement parl√©. On se doutait, mais on n'√©tait pas s√ªr. Tu te doutais ? Depuis combien de temps ? Peut-√™tre 5 ans ? 5 ans ? Il m'avait tous regard√© faire l'idiote. J'ai laiss√© tomber les cl√©s de Will et je suis retourn√© au gris. Les hamburgers √©taient noircis, comme tout le reste. F√™te est finie et j'annon√ßais, merci d'√™tre venu voir ma famille se d√©truire. Alors que les gens commen√ßaient √† partir, Emily s'est approch√©e de moi 1 fois de plus. Et maintenant, papa ? J'ai regard√© cette fille que j'avais √©lev√©e, aim√©e, prot√©g√©e et qui n'√©tait peut-√™tre m√™me pas la mienne. Maintenant on d√©couvre ce qui est r√©el et je dis-nous pensions toutes qu'elle traversait 1 p√©riode difficile. Peut-√™tre 1 d√©pression saisonni√®re, peut-√™tre des probl√®mes familiaux. Des filles organis√©es ont 1 intervention, elles la coincertent apr√®s l'√©cole avec des fleurs et son caf√© pr√©f√©r√© et elle les regarda et dit, √ßa ne m'int√©resse pas, juste √ßa. Puis elle se dirige vers sa voiture. Les jours se transform√®rent en semaine, les filles pass√®rent de l'inqui√©tude au d√©sespoir. Elles √©tablirent 1 planning pour prendre de ses nouvelles, laissent des mots dans son casier et fi√®re m√™me intervenir la conseill√®re qui lui dit qu'elle se concentrait sur elle-m√™me et qu'il n'y avait rien d'anormal. √áa n'avait pas march√©. Elles en parl√®rent √† 1 de nos enseignantes. Elle demanda √† hi√© pourquoi elle ne participait pas √† l'organisation de l'assembl√©e pour l'autonomisation des femmes. Hi√© r√©pondit, ce n'est plus de mon ressort. Puis nous apprime tout ce qui s'√©tait pass√© lors d'une grande fight du nouvel an chez Wyatt. Hi √©tait parti avec ses amis les plus proches, pr√™te √† √™tre la conductrice d√©sign√©e et √† prot√©ger quiconque. Mais quelqu'un avait drogu√© son verre et elle avait commenc√© √† se sentir vraiment mal et d√©sorient√©e. Elle avait r√©ussi √† s'enfermer dans les toilettes √† l'√©tage lorsqu'elle avait r√©alis√© que quelque chose n'allait pas, avait envoy√© 1 SMS au groupe de discussion avec ses amis, celle qu'elle appelait ses S≈ìurs d'√¢me, elle avait tap√© Alight, s'il vous pla√Æt. Il y a 1 probl√®me. Je crois que quelqu'un a mis quelque chose dans mon verre. J'ai peur. Je me suis enferm√© dans les toilettes de Wyatt. Venez me chercher tout de suite. Puis 1 autre. Je ne tiens pas debout correctement, d√©p√™chez-vous. Puis quelqu'un essaya d'entrer. S'il vous pla√Æt. Amira r√©pondit, tu es s√ªr que tu n'as pas trop bu ? 9 √©crivies. On ne peut pas partir maintenant. Il y a des gars de State college ici. Siena dit, vomi et tu iras mieux. Putain. √âcrivies, on viendra te voir tout √† l'heure. Aucun d'eux ne monta pour v√©rifier. Ils √©taient 10m plus bas √† √©changer des coups avec des inconnus tandis qu'elle √©tait pi√©g√©e et terrifi√©e. He, mes parents m'ont envoy√© 1 message group√©. On donne ton h√©ritage √† ta s≈ìur. Elle a des enfants, toi, non. J'ai simplement r√©pondu, d'accord, quand ils ont d√©couvert ce que j'avais fait, de l'argent il y a 3 mois. Le message est arriv√© alors que j'√©tais √† mon salon de tatouage en train de tatouer la manche d'une cliente. Mes mains n'ont m√™me pas trembl√© en le lisant. Chris, donne ton h√©ritage √† Hannah. C'est 1 m√®re c√©libataire, elle en a plus besoin que toi. Je m'attendais √† √ßa depuis que Hannah est revenue vivre avec ses 2 enfants apr√®s son divorce. la petite prodige qui n'a jamais travaill√© 1 seul jour mais qui d'une certaine mani√®re, m√©ritait tout qu'ils ignoraient. 3 mois auparavant, j'avais d√©j√† retir√© la totalit√© de mon h√©ritage, soit huit-cent-mille dollars, apr√®s avoir entendu papa dire √† maman, va tout gaucher dans son stupide entreprise de tatouage. Bref, ce soir-l√†, je me suis rendu dans le pire quartier de la ville et j'ai achet√© 1 immeuble en ruine car, sans poser de questions, pendant 3 mois, je l'avais r√©nov√© en secret pendant les heures creuses de mon atelier, le transformant en centre communautaire avec des activit√©s p√©riscolaires gratuites, des cours d'or et des repas pour les enfants dont les parents n'avaient pas les moyens. L'inauguration √©tait pr√©vue demain, les informations locales arrivaient, le maire serait l√† et j'avais accroch√© 1 immense banderole devant le centre communautaire familial Reynolds, lancer par Chris Reynolds en l'honneur des enfants qui m√©ritent mieux. Mon t√©l√©phone s'est mis √† vibrer, ah non, d'abord Chris, ne dramatise pas, j'ai vraiment besoin d'argent. Puis maman, ton p√®re et moi pensons que tu es √©go√Øste, appelle-nous. J'ai fait 1 capture d'√©cran de leur message et je les ai publi√© sur la page Facebook du centre communautar que j'avais cr√©√©. Parfois la famille te d√©√ßoit, mais cette communaut√© ne d√©cevra pas ses enfants. Le message est devenu viral. Du jour au lendemain, les entreprises locales ont commenc√© √† faire des dons. Les gens ont partag√© leurs propres histoires de trahison familiale. Au matin, mes parents n'arr√™taient pas de m'appeler. J'ai finalement r√©pondu, Chris, on nous traite de parents horribles, c'est exclam√© maman, c'est marrant comme √áa, ai-je dit en observant les enfants √† travers ma vitrine d√©j√† rassembl√©e pour l'ouverture du lendemain. On ne connaissait pas votre centre des papas. Tu ne m'as jamais demand√© ce que je faisais de mon argent. Tu as juste suppos√© que je le gaspillerai. Mais Hannah a vraiment besoin de. Hannah a besoin de trouver 1 travail. Ses enfants ont besoin d'espoir. J'ai raccroch√© et me suis retourn√©e vers ma cliente. O√π en √©tions-nous le lendemain ? Plus de 200 personnes √©taient pr√©sentes, des enfants peignants, des fresques murales, des parents en pleurs, les cam√©ras de t√©l√©vision en marche. Mes parents sont arriv√©s √† mi-chemin, l'air mortifi√© par les journalistes qui les interrogeaient sur le g√©n√©reux don de leur fils se tenait derri√®re eux, r√©alisant que son ticket repas venait de financer quelque chose qu'elle ne pouvait pas toucher. La journaliste s'est approch√©e de moi. Chris, qu'est-ce qui a inspir√© ce don incroyable √† la communaut√© ? J'ai regard√© droit dans les yeux la cam√©ra, puis mes parents. Ma grand-m√®re disait toujours que l'argent r√©v√®le le caract√®re. Elle a laiss√© ce fond fiduciaire pour voir ce qu'on en ferait. Le visage de mon p√®re, palli. Que veux-tu dire ? J'ai souri en sortant mon t√©l√©phone. Et aussi, elle a aussi laiss√© 1 lettre √† son avocat. Dois-je la lire ? La foule se rapprocha tandis que j'ouvrais l'email que je gardais pour ce moment. Si mon petit-fils Chris utilise son h√©ritage pour aider les autres, il recevra le v√©ritable h√©ritage, les biens immobiliers. Familiaux d'une valeur de 15.000.000 de dollars. S'il est √©go√Øste, il ira √† 1 ≈ìuvre caritative. Anna, reste √† bouche b√©e. Tes biens immobiliers commerciaux ? Quels biens immobiliers commerciaux ? Ceux dont grand-m√®re ne t'a jamais parl√© ? Dis l'empire locatif qu'elle a b√¢ti, les propri√©t√©s que tu pensais n'√™tre que de vieux b√¢timents. Mes parents avaient l'air √©c≈ìur√©. On pensait t'apprendre √† √™tre responsable en donnant l'argent √† Anna. Et c'est vrai. Tu m'as appris que ce n'est pas le sang qui fait la famille, c'est le caract√®re qui fait la famille. L'avocat s'avan√ßa avec des documents. Chris, f√©licitations. √Ä ce jour, tu poss√®des 17 locaux commerciaux √† travers la ville. Anna s'est mise √† pleurer, ce n'est pas juste. J'ai des enfants √† nourrir et maintenant ils auront 1 centre communautaire ou grandir. Et je dis, gr√¢ce au fond fiduciaire, que tu pensais recevoir le meilleur dans tout ce. La publication virale sur Facebook a rapport√© $50.000 de dons suppl√©mentaires. La 1√®re semaine. Mes parents ont pass√© des mois √† essayer de se refaire 1 r√©putation. Anna a d√ª trouver son 1√®re vrai travail √† 34 ans. Continue. Ce qui a pouss√© la fille des filles √† tourner le dos √† toutes celles qui avaient besoin d'elle. On savait toutes que hyyer laisserait le monde br√ªler si cela signifiait prot√©ger les filles. Elle consid√©rait l'amiti√© f√©minine comme 1 religion sacr√©e. Elle raccompagna des filles d√©fonc√©es apr√®s des soir√©es, partageait son dernier tampon avec des fesses qu'elle n'avait jamais rencontr√©es et Savait quel gar√ßon √©viter avant tout le monde.

Sie schickten Mir sogar eine wahlgesang playlist und dachten, das k√∂nnte meine ozean obsession befriedigen. Schlie√ülich, im 8. monat schwanger hatten wir die geschlechtsverkehr, obwohl die gesichtsausdr√ºcke meiner familie f√ºr eine beerdigung gepasst h√§tten.

Da verlor ich es v√∂llig und fing so heftig an zu lachen, dass ich Mir fast in die hose gemacht h√§tte. Tim kr√ºmte sich vor lachen mit tr√§nen im gesicht. Alle starten verwirrt und dachten, schwangerschaftshormone h√§tten uns kaputt gemacht. Ich keuchte zwischen den lachern hervor. Er hei√üt Oliver und ich entbinde in einem krankenhaus mit epidural und absolut ohne delfine. Die erleichterung war wie bei begnadigungen im todestrakt. Meine schwester schrie gott sei dank so laut, dass die nachbarn √ºber den zaun schauten. Meine schwiegermutter fing an freudentr√§nen zu weinen und umarmte mich, bis ich nicht mehr atmen konnte. Niemand stellt Mir aufdringliche fragen. Wenn sie bei baby nummer 2 neugierig werden, erw√§hnt Tim, dass wir vielleicht n√§chstes mal seepferdchen versuchen und sie ziehen sich sofort zur√ºck voller angst.

La 1√®re semaine, mon t√©l√©phone est rest√© muet, exactement comme elle l'avait pr√©dit. La 2e, mon fr√®re a appel√© 47 fois. Personne ne savait utiliser la machine √† laver que j'entretenais depuis des ann√©es. Les v√™tements sont assez en montagne. Il a fini par acheter des cale√ßons neufs plut√¥t que d'apprendre le bouton essorage. La 3e semaine, ma s≈ìur a d√©barqu√© √† mon ancien boulot en pleurs, suppliant mes coll√®gues de lui donner mon N¬∞ urgence familiale. En fait-elle n'arrivait pas √† renouveler sa carte grise. Je m'en √©tais occup√© depuis ses 16 Ans, mes coll√®gues lui ont dit que j'√©tais parti vivre ailleurs. Elle a craqu√© sur le parking, incapable de trouver m√™me l'adresse de la pr√©fecture. Elle a fini par filer ‚Ç¨300 √† 1 type louche qui lui avait promis de s'en occuper au 2e mois. Mon p√®re a parcouru toutes les r√©sidences de la ville pour me retrouver. Il n'avait jamais r√©alis√© que j'√©tais celui qui suivait les ordonnances, les courses, les factures sans moi. Il a rat√© 3 semaines de comprimer pour l'attention et a d√ª filer aux urgences. Le m√©decin lui a demand√© s'il avait du soutien familial. a fix√© le sol et marmonn√© que sa fille avait √©t√© partie. Maman, elle, s'est effondr√©e en comprenant que j'avais g√©r√© tous les anniversaires et rendez-vous m√©dicaux pendant des d√©cennies.

Introduction to psychology, where the professor made us laugh while explaining Freud. Creative writing, where we'd already started working on short stories. Even statistics seemed interesting with the right teacher. I was sitting on a bench outside the library, feeling like my life was finally beginning when they called. My mom's voice was oddly cheerful for someone destroying my future. We need you to listen carefully, honey. We can't pay for school anymore. What happened to the college savings account you've had for me since I was a baby? My voice cracked. They'd shown me the statements every birthday. Watch the numbers grow. Used it as motivation when I didn't want to study for the S A T S. That money was supposed to be sacred, untouchable. Mine. There was a pause before my dad cleared his throat. I had some problems. We're going to need all the money back to pay some debts. Which was weird because she didn't say what kind of debts. Then what am I supposed to do? I felt like I might throw up. My mom jumped back in with her solution. You need to find a rich boyfriend by the end of the month. You go to school with plenty of wealthy students. And you have a good body, so it wouldn't be impossible for you to get a boyfriend to turn into a husband. I sat there stunned while she kept talking. She explained their whole plan like she thought it through carefully. How I should target guys in the business school. How I should dress more revealing. How I should laugh at their jokes even if they weren't funny. If you just don't break up with him, even if he cheats on you, then in seven years you can go back to school again.

My parents believed that inheritance money destroyed young people. After my grandmother left me $50,000 when I was 15, they put it in a trust I couldn't touch until 30. Every teenager who gets early money becomes a burnout, mom would preach. They buy cars, party, drop out. We're protecting you from yourself. They made me sign papers. Everything away. Made me live like the money didn't exist. At 17, I worked at subway for minimum wage while 50 grand sat in an account I couldn't touch. My friends thought I was crazy. Just petition the court, they'd say. But fighting my parents meant lawyers, family drama, maybe losing the money entirely, and legal fees. That's when I discovered dropshipping. Started with $50 from my subway check. Buying phone cases from China, reselling them online. First month, I made $200. Second in a month, $800. By senior year of high school, I was clearing $5,000 monthly. While my parents thought I was studying in my room, I got creative with hiding it. Opened accounts at three different banks using my work address. Had packages delivered to my friend Sarah's house. Kept cash and tampon boxes inside, old textbooks behind picture frames. My room looked like a normal teenagers, but it held $30,000 in various hiding spots. Why do you need new shoes? Mom would ask. Those still have souls. The subway job doesn't pay enough for extras, dad would add. Budget better. Meanwhile, I had enough to buy a car. Cash. But I kept taking the bus, kept wearing thrift store clothes, kept the act. Everything changed the week before graduation. I came home early from school with a headache. Mom's car was in the driveway, but Dad's was gone. Normal for 2 p m. But when I walked in, mom was at the kitchen table with papers everywhere. Crying mom. She tried to hide the papers, but I saw the header. Second notice. Medical debt collection. It's nothing, she said, shoving them in a drawer. That night, I went.

The man doesn't even say his name, just stares at all of us, breathing heavily, and then asks really loud, whose parents work in the downtown offices? You know, the big buildings. Nobody raises their hand because we all know about stranger danger, and this guy seems dangerous. He gets mad, and his face goes from red to almost purple. He yells, I know some of you have parents there. This is important! Finally, me and four other kids slowly raise our hands because maybe something happened to our parents and he needs to tell us. He points at us and says, you five stay after the bell rings. Everyone else, leave as fast as you can. The girl next to me grabs my wrist and whispers, run with me. But my legs won't move. What if my mom needs me, and this man is supposed to take me to her? The bell rings, and everyone practically runs out like the rooms on fire. The man locks the door behind them with this loud click, and my stomach drops like on a roller coaster. He won't even let us near our backpacks where our phones are. The quiet Girl starts crying, and he doesn't even care. Just keeps checking the window. Then his watch saying 15 minutes. We wait 15 minutes, which makes no sense because our parents usually pick us up in five minutes. The classroom phone rings, and he rips it from the wall. Like, actually rips it out and throws it in the trash. And now I'm really scared, because why would he do that unless he's kidnapping us? We hear sirens outside. Lots of them, getting louder. He stands in front of the door, blocking it with his.

I replied, fine. For 3 years, I've been the IT guy for my dad's construction company. Built their entire digital system. Project management, client databases, payroll processing, everything. They paid me 45 k while my cousins made 80 k doing basic office work. Let me paint you the full picture here. When I started, Dad's company was still using paper filing cabinets and Excel spreadsheets. From 2015, they had invoices getting lost, double full booked equipment, and clients calling constantly asking for project updates that nobody could find. I spent six months building them a custom system from scratch. Client portal where customers could track their projects in real time. Automated scheduling that prevented equipment conflicts, digital invoicing that cut payment delays from 45 days to 12 days. Even built them an app where Foreman could upload progress photos directly to client accounts. The transformation was insane. Revenue jumped from 800K to $2.3 million in 18 months. Dad kept bragging to other contractors about his high tech operation, never mentioning who actually built it. But here's where it gets interesting. My cousins Damon and Silas, who barely graduated high school, were suddenly project coordinators making serious money. Damon's main job was driving to job sites and taking pictures I had to upload for him because he couldn't figure out the system. Silas spent most days playing games on his phone while I handled actual emergencies. And there's Dad's new wife, Marlene married him eight months ago and immediately started inserting herself into the business. Made herself operations manager despite never working construction a day in her life. Started suggesting we modernize by switching to cheaper software solutions she found on Google every time I tried explaining why our custom system

That the problem was my big nose and my mommy pooch from having kids. Like those were things I could just fix with a makeover or something. I was literally packing divorce papers when our daughter Carla got hit by a car while riding her bike. He survived, but needed years of surgeries and rehab. So Larry and I agreed to stay together for the kids, keep things civil. He kept cheating the whole time, but by then, I was done caring about his Faithfulness. I just wanted to get Carla better. We finally divorced after both kids went off to college. Larry immediately married some 33 year old from his office. Meanwhile, I'm alone for the first time in decades. That's when I decided to actually focus on myself for once. Coloured my hair this nice Auburn shade. Lost about 15 pounds at the gym. Bought clothes that actually fit instead of hiding under baggy sweaters. Started going to singles events. Went on actual dates for the first time in years. Nothing crazy. Just normal stuff people do when they're single.

J'√©tais si en col√®re que je pouvais √† peine parler. Elle m'avait regard√© pleurer pendant des mois en pensant que je n'√©tais pas assez bien. Elle m'avait consol√©e tout en sachant qu'elle √©tait la raison pour laquelle j'avais √©t√© refus√©e. Elle avait vol√© ma lettre d'acceptation, ma bourse, toute mon futur. J'ai appel√© l'universit√© et j'ai tout expliqu√©. Ils ont dit que c'√©tait de la fraude et qu'ils devraient expulser Camille imm√©diatement. Je me suis senti mal pendant environ 2secondes. Puis-je me suis souvenu qu'elle avait v√©cu ma vie pendant des mois pendant que je pensais √™tre 1 √©chec, Camille a √©t√© expuls√©e 3 jours avant le d√©but des cours. Elle est rentr√©e √† la maison en me criant dessus pour avoir ruin√© sa vie. Elle a dit que j'√©tais jalouse et vindicative, que je pr√©f√©rerais l'avoir √©chou√© plut√¥t que r√©ussir

I spent three years with Kayla and figured she was the one. She wasn't flashy or dramatic like my ex girlfriend's. She was calm, kind of shy, and hated any kind of public attention. That's what I loved about her. She'd get embarrassed if I even held her hand in front of people. So when I decided to propose, I made it super low key. No big restaurant scene or flash mob or anything crazy like that. Just a picnic by the lake where we had our first date. Brought sandwiches, some wine, the simple ring I'd saved up for months to buy. No photographers, no family hiding in the bushes. Just us. I got down on one knee right as the sun was setting. My hands were shaking so bad, I almost dropped the ring. But I managed to get the words out. She looked shocked for a second, then started crying. Happy tears. Thought she said yes. Quiet and soft, like everything else about her. But definitely yes. We went home that night, and she cooked dinner like nothing had happened. We watched some Netflix show. She even wore the ring to bed. I kept staring at it on her finger, thinking how lucky I was. The next morning, I woke up alone. That wasn't weird, since she always got up early for work. But when I went to brush my teeth, her toothbrush was gone. I opened her dresser. Drawer empty. Check the closet. Half the hangers were bare. Even her Netflix account was signed out of our TV. I thought maybe there was some family emergency. Called her phone, straight to voicemail. Texted her like, 20 times. Drove to the clinic where she worked as a receptionist. Her coworker Amy, said she'd called in sick. But Amy looked weird when she said it, like she was lying. For three days, I was going crazy. Called her mom, her sister, even drove by her old apartment, thinking maybe she went back there. Nothing. Then I got a text that made my stomach drop. You didn't do anything wrong, Ryan. But I had to say yes to avoid the drama. I didn't want to make a scene at the lake. Sorry. I read it like 10 times before it sank in. She'd been planning this. She let me propose knowing she was going to disappear. She said yes just so she wouldn't have to deal with my reaction in the moment. The worst part was.

A little girl opened the door and frowned at me. You're ten minutes late and look like you pick up men on the streets. Are you sure you're qualified to babysit me? When I answered an ad for babysitting at $50 an hour, honestly, the first thing I expected was for it to be a scam or something dangerous. But I had nothing to lose. I followed the address to a fancy apartment building and knocked on the door. A 13 year old girl dressed like little Miss CE oh. Open the door, you're 10 minutes late, she said, pointing at her wristwatch. I laughed awkwardly. Better late than never. She looked me up and down and groaned, oh boy, we have a lot to do. I followed her inside the most gorgeous three bedroom apartment in New York, one with literal Roman columns and busts like you'd see in films. She sat down at a table with tea already set up and got straight to business. You're not babysitting. I need you to be my mother. She handed me a folder with a fake backstory as a marketing consultant who travels for work, a school map with your names highlighted, and a practice sheet for my fake signature. Parent teacher conference tonight. We leave in three hours. I looked around the room for hidden cameras and sat down looking over the papers. Alright, Kiddo, where are your parents? She clasped her hands together, all serious, like Sasuke Uchiha always did as a kid. Are you in or out? Because I have two others waiting. I smiled and reached out to shake her hand. I'm in. Well, the kid Abby seriously coached the crap out of me. I mean, I hadn't tried to memorize anything this hard since high school, and even then I never put this much effort. She drilled all her information into me, her full life story. Compact like a wiki page that I can't just control f in front of the teachers. She had me change my clothes into the plaid that only rich people really wore, and had me fix my makeup into something simpler, less flashy. Don't promise follow up emails if they mention volunteering you travel for work. Don't smile too much. You're a busy woman who loves her daughter but doesn't have time for school politics. Got it?

My dad died last March after battling cancer for two years. The whole thing was brutal, watching him slowly waste away. My mom became a shell of herself during those final months. We all pulled together as a family except for my brother Chet. He had been the black sheep for years before dad got sick. Chet had stolen money from dad and dropped out of college three times. He refused to get a job or take any responsibility for his life. Dad finally cut him off financially last year after Chet stole $30,000. He took the money straight from their retirement account without asking anyone. When dad passed away, Chet showed up at the funeral home acting devastated. He even volunteered to handle the gravestone paperwork to help mom out. We were all shocked, but thought maybe losing dad had changed him. Mom was barely functioning, so we let Chet handle the Monument arrangements. We had already picked out the inscription. Together as a family. Family. It would say. Beloved father and husband forever in our hearts. The words were simple and classic. Exactly what dad would have wanted. The funeral came and went without any major incidence. Chet gave a speech about redemption and family that made everyone cry. For three weeks after the funeral, we thought he'd finally grown up. Mom even started talking about reconciling with him. She kept saying, dad would have wanted the Family to stay together. Then the day of the gravestone unveiling arrived three weeks later. Mom had been counting down to this moment since the funeral ended. She desperately needed that closure and permanent place to visit dad. My other brother, Simon, drove her to the cemetery that morning. I met them there with fresh flowers for the grave. Chet said he'd meet us there, but texted that he was running late. The cemetery worker LED us to Dad's lot in the memorial garden section. A black cloth covered the new granite stone that had just been installed. Mom was already crying while clutching

Two months ago, my older sister Rachel had invited a few friends over while they were at a movie and came home to 30 people. Two literally in my bed. Rachel just rolled her eyes and promised. But twenty minutes after they left, I already heard her on the phone. Marco finally texted me back. He said he wants me to throw a party tonight. When I reminded her about Dad's threat, she grabbed my wrist hard enough to leave red marks. This is my only chance with Marco before he graduates. He's my lover, she hissed at me. You say one word, I'll make sure no one ever sits with you at lunch again. I tried explaining that dad would literally disown her this time. She just laughed. It's just a small thing. Maybe five people. Rachel had always been the pretty one, the popular one, the one who could destroy my social life with a single Instagram story. I should have known she was lying, because an hour later, 20 people showed up. She even put Milo's bed in the living room because she heard Marco loves dogs. She came into my room. Hey, sis, why don't you stay in here till later? Before I could respond, she walked out, and I heard the click. Of my door locking from the outside. She'd installed that lock years ago as a prank that my parents never found out about. Rachel, this isn't funny! Let me out! I shouted, banging on the door. Her voice came through cold. Shut up, or I'll tell everyone you still wet the bed. Marco's here, and I'm not letting you ruin this for me! The music started blasting, completely drowning out my calling for help. I could hear voices, laughter, the base shaking our walls. I tried calling my parents, but it went straight to voicemail. I was completely trapped for two hours.

My roommate Kevin claimed he was allergic to vinegar. Kevin would talk about how grateful he was to finally have a roommate who understood his condition. His previous roommates apparently didn't care enough. The weirdness started when I noticed Kevin volunteering to take out the trash every single week. Not just offering, insisting. He'd grab the bags before I could even tie them up. When I jokingly said I could handle trash duty, he'd say, no, no, I've got a system. Plus you already do so much with my allergy and everything. Then one day I saw him outside throwing out a pickle jar. I mean, sure, that doesn't have to mean anything, but this was weird. Not just because he threw it out, but because when I asked him, he just froze and said, what pickle jar? Kevin had left for his early shift, so I had the apartment to myself. I decided to start checking our trash cause this was weird. I mean, why would he lie? Then one day, a pickle jar buried under everything, selling strongly of vinegar and dill. Maybe somebody used our bin. Maybe he's having someone over when I'm not around and that person eats pickles and they hide it. Yep, that's definitely it. Went to his room to see if it looked like he'd had people over. Nope, everything was fine. We usually watch Movies in there together and it all looked the same. I couldn't figure it out. Why would anyone pretend to have a life threatening allergy just to cover up a love for pickles? It made no sense. Was he embarrassed about his pickle obsession? Was this some weird fetish? I didn't want to understand. Then I saw in his trash notebook. I opened it for a second, just curious. Figured maybe it was a to do list or something boring. But no. No quick glance after what I saw. GPS coordinates at the bottom of every page. A date, a time, and some coordinates. My brain went straight to drug dealer.

No, I'm not confused at all. You showed me this video last Tuesday, Blair. You were crying about it. Margo turned her phone screen toward me.

Do you ever get kicked out of somewhere for doing exactly what you were told you could do? Yeah, me too. It happened at this grimy little place called Big Benny's. All you can eat buffet. 1499. No time limit, no small print. Just pay, eat, repeat. Or so I thought. Now I'm not some competitive eater or 600 pound menace with a bib and back problems. I'm just a guy with an appetite and a grudge against portion control. I hadn't eaten in 24 hours. Why? Because I prepared for this. Fasting, hydrating, mentally visualizing the tray of ribs like it was the Olympic podium. You know, normal stuff. First plate, fried chicken, Mac and cheese, two rolls. Nothing crazy. I'm easing into it. Second plate, more carbs. Potatoes, lasagna, garlic bread. Third, I start seeing staff eyeing me like I'm stealing food from their children. One of the servers actually slowed down as she walked past like I was a suspicious dog, growling near her purse. By the fifth plate, I swear the manager was hiding behind the soda machine like I was gonna bite him. Plate seven, that's when it got interesting. I went full throttle. Barbecue ribs stacked like Lincoln Logs, a pile of meatballs, three chicken thighs and six brownies I definitely didn't take from the kids section. I sat down, fork in hand. When the manager finally slithered over with two of his most underpaid teenage minions. Like Henman from a movie, no one finishes. He goes, sir, we're going to have to ask you to leave. You've exceeded reasonable consumption. Excuse me, what? Is there a rule on how much I can eat? I asked. There isn't. But, you know, I actually don't know. Benny, I know you have a sign out front in Comic Sans that says all you can eat. It does not say all. We feel emotionally comfortable watching you eat. So I stood up, and you know what I did? I went back for plate No.. 8. He called the cops. I wish I was kidding. Imagine being mid bite into a drumstick, sauce on your chin, when two actual police officers walk in like you're a suspect in a felony mashed potato incident. They looked at then at Benny, then back at me. One of them goes, what exactly did he do? He won't stop eating. There was this long pause, the kind that only happens when someone says something so stupid it has to be processed in layers. The officer turned to me, look, man, could you just go. He looked embarrassed for the manager. I asked if I could at least finish my plate. Benny said, no. Of course he did. I was dangerous.

My dad banned all cooking in our house after his chef brother humiliated him at Thanksgiving. And I mean all cooking. No stove, no microwave, nothing. He literally removed the power cord from our oven and took it to his office like some kind of kitchen dictate. Later, when my uncle called Dad's attempt to make Turkey shoe leather, his face turned purple. He threw his apron on the floor and said our family would never cook again. Mom tried to reason with him, but he went full butthurt and spent three hours removing every cooking appliance from the kitchen. We were only allowed pre packaged, ready to eat foods. Cold cuts, protein bars, bagged salads with those little dressing packets. Even boiling water was forbidden because that counted as food preparation. For months, I watched my friends eat normal hot meals while I unwrapped another sad sandwich. Kids at school thought I was lying when I said we couldn't even make ramen. The embarrassment was pretty bad, but then I started getting these dizzy spells. During basketball practice, my legs would cramp up so bad, I'd have to sit out. That's when I realized this wasn't just about Dad's stupid pride. This diet was literally making me sick. I went to the library after school and started researching nutrition. Turns out I discovered my exact symptoms matched severe magnesium deficiency, which made perfect sense. Since processed foods have basically zero magnesium, so I started my own secret operation using lawn mowing money to buy supplements. Within two weeks of taking them, my cramps appeared, and I could actually finish practice again. I became obsessed with reading ingredient labels, memorizing which preservatives were in everything we ate, because I needed to know what was poisoning me. Slowly, I turned into this weird ingredient encyclopedia, knowing every chemical in our entire kitchen, because survival literally depended on it. Then came the dinner.

Yesterday, he drew our house on fire with us inside. At first, I thought it was a coincidence when Mason drew our neighbor's dog getting hit by a car. And the next day, at four fifteen PM, we heard the screech and the thud. But then Mason drew grandma falling downstairs. I called her immediately and begged her not to use any stairs that day. She laughed at me, but agreed. At seven PM, she called back, crying because she'd forgotten, and started going down to her basement when the first step broke. But she caught herself. That's when I realized Mason wasn't causing these things. He was warning us. Every morning, I check his drawing pad, and there's a new picture showing how someone dies. That not random people. Always someone we know or someone nearby. And if I can figure out what the drawing means, in time, I can save them. I've saved 47 people in three months. Mason draws in his sleep, and when he wakes up, he doesn't remember making the picture. I tried staying up to watch him, and at exactly 3:00am, his eyes stay closed, but his hand starts moving, sketching perfect, detailed scenes of tomorrow's tragedies. Two weeks ago, he drew our mailman Paul drowning. So I slashed Paul tired so he couldn't drive to the lake. He lived. Last week, he drew five kids at the playground getting struck by lightning. I pulled the fire alarm. At the school to keep everyone inside during recess. They live. But yesterday morning I found the worst drawing yet. Our house was engulfed in flames. My wife Sarah, our daughter Emma, Mason and me. All four of us were inside. The detail was horrible. Sarah was trapped in the bedroom, Emma in the back, Mason in his room, and me at the bottom of the stairs. All of us burning. The time stamp Mason always adds said eight forty seven PM today. I tried everything to prevent it. I disconnected all the gas lines, removed every match and lighter, had an electrician check all our wiring, and even called the fire department for a surprise inspection. Everything was perfect. At six PM, I packed everyone in the car. We're staying at a hotel tonight. Why? Sarah asked. I showed her Mason's drawing and she went pale. She'd seen enough of his predictions come true. We drove three towns over and checked into a Holiday Inn. I thought we'd beaten it. But at seven thirty PM, Mason started drawing again. He was awake this time, crying, while his hand moved on its own. The new picture showed us driving back home. The time stamp said eight fifteen PM. I don't

So I made sure she'd never drive again. Amelia had been out of prison for six months when she started asking to borrow my car. She'd lost her license permanently, but somehow thought family would just hand over keys like nothing happened. The crash had killed a seven year old named Manuel. Amelia served three years. Just to the grocery store, she pleaded. I'll be so careful. I always said no. Every single time. But Amelia was persistent. She show up at my apartment with sob stories about job interviews she couldn't get to, medical appointments she was missing. Mom would call, begging me to help my sister rebuild her life. Last month, I caught her going through my purse. Where are your keys? She demanded, tears streaming. I have a date tonight. This guy could be the one. I hid my keys after that. Changed my locks when I found scratches around the keyhole. Amelia started getting desperate. She'd lurk around parking lots, asking strangers for rides. She'd wait at bus stops, then beg drivers for lifts when buses were late. Then Amelia got creative. She started befriending my neighbors, offering to walk their dogs, water their plants. Sweet, helpful Amelia, just trying to make amends. Missus Lynn from 4B mentioned how kind my sister was, always offering rides to the elderly residents. My blood ran cold. I rushed downstairs and found Amelia behind the wheel of Missus Lynn's Honda engine. Running, about to pull out with three senior citizens in the backseat. Amelia, get out of the car now! She looked at me through the window, defiant. They need rides to their doctor appointments. I'm helping people. I called the police immediately. While waiting for them to arrive, I made calls to every neighbor, every friend, anyone Amelia might approach. I warned them all. She's not allowed to drive. She killed a child. The cops couldn't arrest her. Technically, she hadn't broken any laws yet.

My 13 year old Otis had been completely obsessed with this new teammate on Fortnite for almost three weeks straight now. Called herself Luna. Underscore 2,011 claimed she was 13, too. Supposedly lived somewhere in rural Oregon near Portland. They've been playing duos together every single night after school, sometimes staying up until well past midnight on school nights. Which, completely unlike my usually responsible son, Otis was absolutely glowing about this new friendship every single day when he came home. It was honestly the first time he'd really connected with someone online in such a meaningful way since we moved to this new town about six months ago after my job transfer. She was apparently incredible at building complex fortress structures under intense pressure. Knew all the current meta strategies perfectly. They had developed this hilarious running inside joke about terrible random teammates that made him burst out laughing constantly during their intense Victory Royale matches. But then Luna started asking really strange, oddly specific questions in their late night voice chats that made me increasingly uncomfortable as a parent. What exact time did Otis's parents get home from work each weekday? Did our house have ring doorbells or any security cameras installed around the property? When Otis casually mentioned these seemingly random questions that Luna kept asking him during their gaming sessions, every single parental instinct I had developed over 13 years of raising him started screaming absolute Danger. Something was seriously wrong here, and I could feel it in my bones. So I made one of the hardest parenting decisions of my entire life. I did something I had always sworn I would never do to my son, who I trusted completely. I secretly logged into Otis's PlayStation account while he was at basketball practice after school one Tuesday afternoon in November. I started carefully reading through all their private messages and voice chat transcripts from the past several weeks of intense

Something's growing inside him. It started in September when Ryan began his new diet, saying he wasn't hungry anymore and pushing away every meal I made. I'm just not feeling it, he'd say. But his weight kept climbing. First 10 pounds, then 20, then 50. His skin stretched tight and his belly descended like a pregnancy. But he insisted he felt fine, better than ever. I made him see Doctor Miller after the first month, and she ran every test imaginable. The blood work came back strange, showing digestive enzymes that didn't belong in human bodies. But the real shock came from the X ray. Missus Davis, there are shadows in your husband's abdomen, she said, pulling me aside. Multiple masses, but they're not tumors. They look almost like compressed tissue. Has Ryan been eating anything unusual? He hasn't been eating anything at all, I told her, and she looked at me like I was lying. The MRI was scheduled for next week, but Ryan refused to go. I know what's happening to me, he said that night. And it's supposed to happen. My father went through this at 35, and his father before him. Every third generation, one of us is chosen to be the vessel. I found his father's journal in our attic that night, and the entries made my blood freeze. A 45 consumed the Henderson boy. He went down easier than the others. The transformation Requires 100 souls. They compress and merge inside the chosen vessel. What emerges will feed our bloodline for generations. His father had gained weight until he hit exactly 400 pounds, then disappeared. And they found 47 missing people's remains in the woods behind his house. Ryan started having blackouts at night, leaving the house at 2:00am and returning before dawn, covered in dirt and scratches. I followed him once and watched him standing outside houses, his jaw unhinging like a snakes. But I ran home before I could see more. The next morning, I saw the news. Local teacher Madison Wright missing. No signs of struggle. I confronted Ryan, but he had no memory of leaving the house. Sarah, I swear I've been in bed all night, he said. But his breath smelled like perfume. The same kind Madison wore. That's when I started finding things in his vomit. A wedding ring, a watch, pieces of clothing. He couldn't die. Yes. He was hunting people and swallowing them whole during his fugue states Day 67. I couldn't ignore it anymore. Ryan's stomach was moving on its own, rippling with shapes pressing from inside.

I was eating breakfast when my mom walked up and slapped a cereal bowl right out of my hands. The bowl shattered on the floor, milk spraying everywhere. Stop! Stop stealing our food, you mosquito! She screamed. From now on, you buy your own groceries or you don't eat, period! I stared at her, shocked and covered in cold milk and Lucky Charms. For years, I've been using my employee discount at grocery stores and paying for most of it with my own cash. I didn't think I'd ever need to tell them, but now, all of a sudden, I'm a parasite, a freeloader. I kept my mouth shut, cleaned up the mess in silence. Then I went out, bought a few groceries for myself, kept every receipt and and labeled everything with my name. My parents smirked at each other over dinner that night, confident they'd finally save money without their thief bleeding them dry. When we went out to buy groceries, my parents acted arrogant, throwing expensive brands into the cart without looking at the price tags. Perrier sparkling water, truffle oil, Tide Pods. They made it to the cashier and saw the huge 400 dollar price. Their smiles completely disappeared. This place is price gouging! My dad yelled when he got home. It never cost this much before, but it did. It's just they never actually done the shopping themselves. Even at other stores, they ended Up buying pre cut fruit for $30 when whole fruit was $5. Someone convinced them to buy organic water for $40. Falling for the classic it's keep you feeling young and take away all the back pain. They missed out on Tuesday senior discounts, missed every buy one get one sale, threw out receipts with 50 dollar off coupons on the back, and bought things that wouldn't even work with our electric stove. By the end of the month, my parents had spent $2,500 on groceries just for the two of them. Half of them rotting away because they didn't know what.

I froze with my sandwich halfway to my mouth. What video? The entire table went silent. Six pairs of eyes suddenly finding their lunch trays. Fascinating. Gwen's cheeks flushed red as she stammered. I thought you knew. Never mind, it's nothing. But it wasn't nothing. Behind me, I heard muffled laughter and some when whisper my last name followed by more snickering. Gwen, what video? I pressed. My voice rising slightly. She shook her head vigorously, gathering her things with shaking hands. I shouldn't have said anything. Maybe you should go home. I saw a group of juniors behind us pointing their cameras at me and laughing and my heart sank. Whatever this video was, it had to be serious enough for so many people to laugh at me and for my best friend to look nervous. I immediately pulled out my phone and tried to call my parents, but my battery was dead. That's when the bell rang, leaving me no choice but to return to class. Walking into class was like walking into a circus. The second I stepped through the door, the entire room erupted. Not just giggles or whispers, full uncontrollable laughter. Someone in the back row was making this weird motion with their arms like something falling or tumbling down. And the kids around him were practically crying from laughing so hard. Yo, she's actually here. Someone and shouted and more laughter exploded. I stood frozen in the doorway, my face burning. What the hell was so funny? What was in that video? The teacher looked up from his desk and the look on his face made my stomach drop. It wasn't anger at the disruption, but rather pity. Pure, unmistakable pity, like the way people look at you at a funeral. He spoke softly. Walk.

My three older brothers called it babysitting when I moved in with our grandmother after her kidneys failed two years ago. They drop by monthly to pat themselves on the back for letting me live rent free while I supposedly watch T V. All day. During visits, they'd explain dialysis like I was five, even though I've been running her home treatments myself for 18 months. They ambushed me last summer as all three showed up with nursing home pamphlets and a social worker they'd already hired. They gathered in Grandma's living room while she's that. Looking pale from the treatment I just finished, my oldest brother cleared his throat and launched into what was clearly a rehearsed speech. We all need to accept that grandma requires professional care now, and you need to stop hiding from real life and get an actual job. The social worker nodded along, while my middle brother explained that kidney failure required actual medical knowledge, not just good intentions. Playing nurse and driving her to the dialysis center three times a week isn't a lifeline, my youngest brother added while sorting through brochures. Medicare covers places where real nurses monitor patients instead of playing video games and hoping nothing goes wrong. I tried to explain what I actually did, but he cut me off. We see the insurance claims for Monday, Wednesday, Friday treatments, he said slowly, like I might not understand. She needs Round the clock medical care, not just someone making SAM, which is. And tucking her in at night. They didn't know the spare bedroom had become a sterile medical suite where I performed her dialysis myself every morning at 5. I calculated fluid removal rates based on ankle swelling only. I could read the insurance statements. They've been seen and clearly said home hemodialysis. But they assumed it was a billing code for the center since they couldn't imagine I was actually doing it myself. The machine runs itself anyway. My oldest brother told the social worker, you just connect tubes and watch Netflix for four hours. The social worker started explaining admission procedures. When grandma's breathing changed in that specific way, that meant she had

He's maybe 35, works from home doing something with cryptocurrency, and has way too much time to monitor everyone else's business. He installed security cameras pointing directly at our property line. Then he put up those ridiculous private property, no trespassing signs every five feet along his fence. The guy even painted his grass with some kind of spray to make it look more green, which was weird, but whatever. My daughter Zoe plays in our backyard all the time. She's eight, loves soccer, and kicks the ball around for hours. Our yards are separated by one of those low, decorative fences, maybe two feet high. And sometimes her ball goes over like any normal kid. She'd hop over, grab it, and hop back. Takes literally 10 seconds. Last Tuesday, Zoe was playing when her ball went over Logan's fence. She hopped over to get it, and I watched from the kitchen window as Logan came storming out of his house. He started screaming at her. I could hear him yelling about property rights and respect for boundaries at an eight year old. I ran outside and told Logan to back off Zoe. He was crying and ran inside. I explained that kids sometimes chase balls. It's not a big deal, and Asked him to not yell at my daughter. Logan got up in my face and said, your little brat needs to learn boundaries. This is my property, and I don't want her stepping foot on it ever again. I told him she was just getting her ball and would be more careful, but he wasn't having it. Then yesterday came, so he was playing again when her ball went over. She looked at me through the window, and I nodded. It's a ball, for crying out loud. She hopped over, grabbed it, and started hopping back. That's when Logan appeared with his phone already dialing. I couldn't believe it. I ran outside as Zoe came back, confused and scared because this grown man was on the phone with the police about her. 20 minutes later, a police car pulled up. The officer got out, looking like he'd rather be literal.

But she's been buried for 11 years. The humming started three weeks ago. I woke up at exactly 4:00am to the sound of my mother's favorite lullaby. Drifting up from the kitchen, half asleep, I almost called out to her before remembering she'd been dead for 11 years. The first night, I convinced myself it was a dream. The second night, I noticed the time again, 4:00am. The third night, same thing. Always that same lullaby she used to hum while making breakfast. Always from the kitchen, always at 4:19. On the fourth night, I set my phone to record. At 4:19, the humming began. When I played it back the next morning, my blood went cold. There it was, faint but unmistakable. My mother's voice humming you are my Sunshine. I still had an old voicemail from her saved on my phone from two weeks before she died. She'd called to remind me about dinner plans, and at the end, she'd hummed a few bars while looking for her keys. I compared the recordings. The pitch, the rhythm, the slight rasp she developed from years of smoking. Identical. That morning, I found things moved in the kitchen. Kettle was on the stove instead of the counter where I always left it. A spoon lay next to the sink, still wet. One chair was pulled out from the table at her usual spot. I started sleeping downstairs on The couch, to be closer to the kitchen. Every night at 4:19, the humming would begin. Sometimes it lasted 30 seconds, sometimes five minutes. I'd lie there paralyzed, unable to move, just listening to my dead mother's voice filling the darkness. After a week of this, I drove to Riverside Cemetery. Mom's grave looked normal at first, but when I knelt down, I noticed the grass seemed looser than the surrounding plots. The dirt beneath looked recently disturbed, like something had pushed up from below and been hastily covered. I called the cemetery office. They had no record of any maintenance on that plot that night. I decided to wait in the kitchen. I set up my phone on the counter to record and sat at the table in complete darkness. At 4:18, I watched the clock on the microwave, my heart pounding. 4:19. The humming started immediately. But this time it was different. It wasn't coming from some vague direction. It was right behind me. My mother's voice, clear as if she was standing over my shoulder, humming our song. I couldn't move, every muscle locked in terror.

You're 90 years old, ate dinner too late, and now you're panicking. On a scale of one to 10, how bad is your imaginary emergency? When I said eight, he actually laughed. Right. Everyone says eight. Real pain doesn't let you walk in here in your pajamas looking so put together. My pajamas were soaked with sweat from the pain. When did you last have your period? He asked with a smirk. When I said I was postmenopausal, he nodded like he'd solved everything. There you go. Hormones. They make women your age think every little cramp is a heart attack or appendicitis. Have you tried yoga? Maybe losing some weight? He typed something without examining me. I see a lot of hysterical women your age. Retirement gives you too much time to obsess over every little ache. I tried to explain that I knew my body, but he interrupted, ma'am, I have actual emergencies to deal with. Young man next door got stabbed. That's real medicine. Your psychosomatic belly ache can be handled by your GP on Monday. He started to leave, but I grabbed the rails. Of the bed, please. Something's wrong. I can feel it. He pried my fingers off one by one. This is drug seeking behavior. Are you here for pain pills? Because that's not happening. A nurse came in and harm told her loudly. Just anxiety. Probably wants attention. Her husband probably doesn't listen to her anymore, so she comes here for someone to talk to. He didn't know. My husband died two years ago in this very hospital. Don't waste resources on blood work. Give her some antacids and discharge papers. The nurse looked uncertain, but he snapped. Did I stutter, or do you want to be a doctor now, too? When I asked for a different doctor, he got nastier. You want a doctor shop? Classic drug seeking. I'm noting this in your file. He pulled up my chart on the computer. Oh, look, you've been here before.

I was sitting in Mister Kelton's history class. Just another boring Tuesday afternoon. We were learning about World War 2 when the intercom crackled to life. Lockdown! This is not a drill. Everyone froze, like, dead silent. The kind of quiet that makes your ears ring. Mister Kelton, who was the substitute we'd never seen before, went completely white. His hands started shaking as he grabbed the door handle. Everyone under your desks, now! His voice was different. Serious in a way that made my stomach drop. Most of us had done lockdown drills before. You hide, stay quiet. Wait for the all clear. But Mister Kelton wasn't following the script. He started dragging desks across the room, shoving them against the door like his life depended on it. The scraping sound was so loud, I was sure whoever was out there would hear us. Sir, you're supposed to just lock the door, whispered Jessica from under her desk. Ignored her completely. Next thing I know, he's reaching up and unscrewing the light bulbs with his bare hands. The classroom went dim. Just emergency lighting from the hallway. Creeping under the door. Light gives away position, he muttered to himself, like he was talking to someone we couldn't see. Then he took off his belt, not to hit anyone, but to wrap it around the door handle and tie it to something. His hands moved like he'd done this a thousand times before. Fast, precise. No wasted motion. My friend Tyler's phone buzzed once. Mr. Kelton spun around so fast, I thought he was gonna fall over. Phone. Give it to me now. Tyler looked confused, but, sir, it might be my mom checking if I'm okay. Sound gives you away. Silence is survival. He snatched the phone and powered it off. Anyone else? We all shook our heads real quick. Good. Now shoes off, all of you. What? That was Emma sitting two rows over. Shoes off. Footsteps travel through floors. They can track movement.

My 1 0 year old daughter, Lily kept tattling on her younger brother constantly. Every five minutes it was Mom, Tommy touched my stuff! Or Mom, Tommy looked at me weird or Mom, Tommy breathed too loud during my show. I was losing my mind with the constant interruptions throughout every single day. The breaking point came during an important work call when Lily burst into my office screaming that Tommy had walked past her bedroom door without asking permission. Mission first. My boss and three clients heard the entire meltdown through my unmuted microphone. I was absolutely mortified and knew something had to change, so I implemented a tattling tax system. Every time she tattle on Tommy for something minor or petty, she owed me 25 cents from her weekly allowance money. Only real emergencies were free, like if someone was actually hurt, breaking something valuable, or doing something genuinely dangerous that required intervention. I spent an entire evening explaining the system carefully to both kids, creating specific examples of what counted as tattling versus legitimate concerns that needed my attention. Lily seemed to understand the rules perfectly and even nodded enthusiastically when I said this would help her think before complaining. Tommy just looked absolutely relieved that his sister might finally leave him alone. Battling stopped immediately and completely. For two absolutely blissful weeks, our house was perfectly quiet. No constant complaints echoing through every room. No sibling drama. Interrupting my work calls or peaceful evenings. I could actually focus on important tasks without being summoned every few minutes to referee microscopic disputes. Tommy seemed genuinely happier during this peaceful period, playing freely in common areas without his sister monitoring his every single move like a tiny surveillance officer. He started laughing more often, running around

My nine year old daughter came home crying because her science teacher told her she was lying about her dad being an astronaut. My daughter, Sarah had always been proud that I worked for NASA. Every show and tell, she'd bring my old space gloves or mission patches. Classmates loved hearing stories about how astronauts eat and sleep in space. But then Mrs. Thompson joined the school as the new science teacher. During a lesson about space, Sarah raised her hand and shared how I had been on three missions to the International Space Station. Missus Thompson stopped the lesson and called her a liar in front of everyone. Your father can't be an astronaut, she said. NASA doesn't have any active missions right now. They stopped sending people to space years ago. Sarah tried to explain that I worked with both NASA and Space X, but Missus Thompson cut her off. Then next day, Missus Thompson made Sarah stand in front of the class and apologize for making up stories. She even sent Sarah to the principal's office for spreading lies. When my daughter started crying and insisted she was telling the truth, Sarah came home devastated. He showed me the F grade. Missus Thompson gave her space project with a note saying, stop making up stories about NASA. My daughter had spent weeks on that project using real photos from my missions and actual NASA Data I was furious. I emailed Missus Thompson explaining who I was and attached my NASA credentials. She replied saying those could easily be faked, and threatened to report me for encouraging my daughter to lie.

He even knew I always bought strawberry Pop Tarts from the vending machine after class. Your dad sent me to get you to the hospital, he said, showing me his phone with what looks like a text from Dad's number. My hands were shaking, but I got in his beat up Honda Civic. He didn't drive toward the hospital. Instead, he got on Highway 52, going the opposite direction. When I asked where we were going, he pressed the door locks and said, change of plans, kiddo. I watched him throw my backpack out the window about 10 minutes later, including my phone. My stomach dropped when I realized what was happening. We drove for two hours. He kept the radio on some country station and occasionally offered me beef jerky from a bag on his dashboard. He wasn't mean or scary like the kidnapper movies I'd seen. He just seemed lonely and kept talking about how his daughter would have been my age if she hadn't moved away with his ex wife. Finally, he stopped at a shell station near some tiny town I'd never heard of. Bathroom break, he said, walking me inside while keeping his hand on my shoulder. The women's restroom was small and dingy. The Broken mirror and a trash can overflowing with paper towels. That's when I saw it. Taped to the back of the door was this faded poster about human trafficking. At the bottom it said, if. If you're in danger, leave a note where someone will find it. I didn't have paper, but in my jacket pocket was the receipt from the art supply store where I bought paint brushes earlier. Using a stubby pencil from the same pocket, I wrote, help kidnapped in gray Honda. Please call police. I folded it tight and dropped it behind the trash bin.

Julia seemed happy, too, but there was something off about her energy. She kept checking her phone and seemed jumpy whenever Mark got too loud with his celebrating. The delivery went smooth. Healthy baby boy. Everything normal. Mark's crying happy tears. Julia's exhausted but smiling. And I'm thinking, this is one of those perfect family moments you live for in this job. Mark immediately starts calling the baby my little champion won't stop talking about how he's gonna teach him to play baseball and fix cars. So here's where it gets messy. We do routine blood work on all newborns. Standard stuff. When the results came back, I had to double check them because something didn't add up. The baby had a B blood type. Mark was type O. Julia was type A. Now, I. I'm not a genetics expert, but I know enough to know this was basically impossible. Type O and type A parents can't have an A B baby. I rechecked Mark's records from his previous visits. Definitely type O. Confirmed multiple times. I even had the lab run the baby's blood again. Same result. My stomach started doing flips because I knew what this Meant, but I hoped maybe there was some mix up. When I handed Julia the standard paperwork that included the blood work results, her face went completely white. Like, scary white. She. I grabbed the paper, crumpled it up real quick, and shoved it in her purse. Then she grabbed my arm and whispered, please don't tell Mark about this. The desperation in her voice was intense. I had to keep working, but I couldn't stop thinking about it.

He was with a girl who couldn't have been older than 16. She wore an oversized hoodie with the hood pulled up, sleeves covering her hands completely. Something about her posture made my stomach twist. Evening, the man said cheerfully, grabbing a bag of chips and a Mountain Dew from the cooler. Beautiful night, isn't it? The girl stayed silent beside him, staring at the floor. Her shoulders were hunched inward, like she was trying to disappear. When he called her sweetie and told her to grab some candy, it sounded wrong, too forced, too careful. I rang up their items, keeping my expression neutral while my brain screamed that something was off. The girl's face was pale, almost gray, dark circles under her eyes. She looked exhausted in a way that went deeper than just being tired. That'll be 7:50, I said, extending the receipt toward the man. He reached for it, but the girl stepped forward. Can I have it? She asked quietly. Her voice was barely above a whisper. The man's jaw tightened for just a second before his smile returned. Of course, honey. As I handed her the receipt, she pulled back her sleeve slightly. That's when I saw it. Her hand was positioned strangely, fingers curled, thumb tucked underneath. Then quick, As lightning, she closed her fingers over her thumb in a subtle motion. My heart stopped. I'd seen that exact gesture on TikTok months ago, the silent signal for help, the one that was supposed to save lives. I kept my face blank, nodding as if nothing happened. Have a good night, I managed to say. The man hurried her toward the door, his hand on her lower back, guiding her movements through the window.

Sometimes my hands would tremble slightly when writing. Nothing dramatic, just enough to make me wonder. Grandmother had died from early onset alzheimer's when she was just 48. My mother at 52. I was 19 when I watched my mom forget my name for the first time. The geneticist told me I had a 50% chance of carrying the same gene mutation. I take a test and know for certain. But I refused. What was the point of knowing my expiration date? So I lived in fear. Every forgotten appointment or misplaced key became evidence of my inevitable decline. I stopped dating entirely. I'd seen what this disease does to partners. I abandoned my law school dreams. Instead, I took a mindless job where mistakes wouldn't matter. I lived frugally, saving for care I'd need someday. My friends drifted away as I didn't go anywhere and didn't try to live a life. By 30, I was essentially just waiting to die. Then came the day I knocked over my beer with food, and something in me just broke. I lost it, screamed at myself and just kept screaming. My neighbor heard and called 9 1 1. The knock came.

She told the officer she forgot I was there because she had errands to run, like I was a grocery bag she left behind. The cop looked at her weird and asked how you forget your kid. Mom just shrugged and said, kids are supposed to stay where you put them. That wasn't even the worst part. Two weeks later, she did it again at the mall. This time I waited four hours until mall security found me asleep on a food court chair. When mom finally came back, she was carrying shopping bags from stores that weren't even in that mall.

My older sister London was always the pretty one because she hit puberty first and got the good genes.

Paris, you're too young for expensive products, London said, examining her perfect complexion in the mirror. Maybe when you learn to wash your face properly. My skin was basically a minefield of cystic acne, blackheads, and scars from picking. London skin glowed like she had a filter on in real life. She made me wait outside the bathroom every morning while she did her 45 minute skincare routine, straightening already perfect hair while I stood there with toothpaste dripping down my chin. When guys came over to study, she'd parade rue in her cutest outfits, telling them about my pizza face and how I used to eat glue in kindergarten. Natural beauty can't be bought, she'd tell her parents when I complained about needing dermatology appointments. Paris needs to learn that personality matters more than looks. The worst part? She'd leave her expensive products all over the bathroom, half used bottles of retinol and vitamin C serum she'd abandoned for the next trending thing. But somehow I was the one wasting money. London loved reminding me how I'd never get asked to prom. You'll probably die a virgin, she'd laugh. Some of us are just meant to be beautiful. High School ended, London went straight to working at the mall because she wanted to get to discovered as a model. Translation she thought her looks would carry her through life. She spent every paycheck on tanning packages and highlights, living for the weekend parties. I went to community college, worked at a pharmacy where I Learned about ingredients. Saved every penny for a dermatologist. London would Snapchat me from clubs while I was studying. Why are you wasting your Friday night? She'd text. Oh, wait. Not like anyone's asking you out anyway. I'm investing in my future. I'd respond, you're just jealous you can't get into the VIP section. After two years, I

Greg wrote that anyone entering their home needs to follow his rules. That means I had to cut all those foods from my kids diet during their week with me.

At first I thought it was some kind of joke, but then Austin came home and told me Craig made him wash his mouth out with mouthwash because he smelled peanut butter on his breath. Blake said Craig inspected their lunch boxes every day like some kind of food detective. When I didn't respond to his first email, Craig sent another one calling me irresponsible and childish. He Said I was putting his daughter's life at risk because I refused to follow simple instructions. Then Amanda got involved and tried to drag me to court to make it part of our custody agreement. The judge basically laughed them out of the courtroom. She told them they had zero right to dictate what I feed my kids in my own home. Craig wasn't even legally related to my boys.

Last night I realized it's a real murder that happens tomorrow. And he's the killer. For three years, every single night, my eight year old son, Ethan has insisted on the exact same bedtime story. Not from a book. He wants me to tell it from memory. If I change even one word, he screams until I start over. Tell me about the red door house, he always says. So I tell him. Once there was a yellow house with a red door at 47 Maple street. Inside lived Mrs. Carpenter, who made cookies every Sunday. She had three cats, muffin, buttons and snowball. One night, a little boy knocked on her red door exactly seven times. The story continues the same way. Every time. The boy asks for water, Mrs. Carpenter lets him in. He goes to her kitchen, takes a knife from the third drawer, and does something I always describe vaguely as a bad thing that made Mrs. Carpenter go to sleep forever. Then he leaves through the back door, counts to 100, and goes home. I thought I made it up. Some half asleep nonsense I created three years ago when Ethan wouldn't stop crying. But he latched onto it, demanding it word for word every night. Last night, after I finished the story, Ethan asked something new. Daddy, is 47 Maple street far from here? There is no 47 Maple street. But it's Just a story. Yes, there is. I looked it up on your phone. It's only six blocks away. My blood went cold. I grabbed my phone and searched. He was right. 47 Maple street existed six blocks from our house. A yellow house with a red door, according to the real estate listing owner, Dorothy Carpenter. I stayed up all night researching. Dorothy Carpenter was 73, lived alone, had three cats. According to her Facebook, the cat. Cats names made me drop my phone. Muffin buttons and snowball. This morning, I drove past her house. Yellow with a red door, exactly as I've been describing for three years. But I've never seen it before. We moved here only three years ago, and I never go that route. I called in sick to work and spent the day trying to rationalize this. Maybe I'd seen it subconsciously. Maybe Ethan had heard about it somewhere. But then I found something that destroyed any rational explanation. In my closet, buried in a box of old papers, I found a journal. I didn't remember keeping my handwriting, but I had no memory of writing it. The first entry was dated four years ago.

I immediately knew if we both applied, Victor would win easily. His hospital volunteer work looked infinitely more impressive than my nursing home job helping elderly residents. That evening, Victor called, panicking about financial aid. His parents made too much for need based aid, but nowhere near enough to cover nursing school costs.

After my rant about the 67 meme, I don't want to hear a single 67 in my comments. If you even think about typing it, I'm pulling out the ban hammer straight up. You're gone. From this point on, it's only low taper fade comments allowed. I want to see it everywhere. Spam it. Make it the new anthem. If 67 can take over the whole internet, then low taper fade deserves its time to shine again. So yeah, the 67 era is dead. We're closing the chapter. The Future Is low Taper fade. And if you're not with us, you're against us. Get out.

He turns into a full on horror movie character. I'm just on the mic gaming with the boys when I hear the door creek open. No footsteps, no warning, just a silhouette in the dark hallway. Then comes the line, tell your friends good night. That sentence has more power than any lecture I've ever heard. I hit party chat like, yo, I gotta go. Vanish without explanation. He's not even mad, just standing there too calm, arms crossed, eyes half open, giving you that stare like he'll shut off power to the whole house. While I'm scrambling to save. He drops the final boss dialogue off now and you don't question it. You just shut it off like survival mode. Ever try turning off a PS five quietly? It's like landing a spaceship. Pressing buttons like diffusing a bomb. Barely breathing so you don't wake him again. Next morning he acts like nothing happened. Sir, you gave me PTSD at 2:00am. Now you're asking if I want toast.

You mean to tell me a star just randomly disappeared overnight? Look at this. Who invited Galactus to our universe? And scientists are saying a star 2.5 million times brighter than the sun just vanished from our scopes. Vanished with no supernova. Hell nah. We either got someone eating stars or there's a glitch in the universe. Take your pick. We're cooked either way. But hey, at least we know we're safe, right? Nope. Since it was so far, it happened 75 million years into the past, which means Galactus could already be in the neighborhood. We'd never even know what hit us. No supernova, no final moment, just lights out. And we're really out here buying matcha lattes and the boo boos while something out there is snacking on whole ass stars? And if it's eating stars like that, what do you think it does to planets? And we're out here thinking nukes make us powerful. We build rockets and pat ourselves on the back. Meanwhile, something's out there crushing suns like grapes. Our biggest flex is splitting atoms out there. They're splitting galaxies. Actually, to be fair, we have made something no alien could compete with, no matter how big the air fryer. So at least we have that while our son is getting burped up. Follow for more daily rants.

I found my work crush share crying in the break room looking completely stressed. My dad's in the hospital and I need to fly out tonight but I can't find anyone to watch my kids. My ex won't answer. The babysitter I hired bailed and I just, I can't afford to miss this flight, but I can't afford anything else either. She leaned against my shoulder crying even harder. I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said. Heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids. Three for at least two weeks. I waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest around 14 looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work. Camilla, the middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, Kevin, wouldn't even look at me. They stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Cher hug them quickly, told them to be good and left for the airport. I stood there with 3 kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. First morning I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed, she's not here, you know, you can stop trying, she said. Besides, you're Not her type. Mom doesn't date guys without kids. We've seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Shares, co workers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps, everyone wanted to play dad until they realized kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. From spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings, they hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive two weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy, be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Sometime within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Leave me alone, he said, turning away. I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get mad at you or do anything without your permission, not even tell your mom. But I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't have a dad, I patted. His head and thanked him, walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. The next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rented GTR, strikingly white engine purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now, I said loudly as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop and quickly he hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said. I picked up the other two kids and took them to in and out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a helmet full of nachos and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. Not bad, old man, Camilla said, watching her siblings enjoy the game, we made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard, I and everything to their mom with a caption, we wish you were here. After that, things between me and the kids sort of changed. When the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom, I sat beside her bed reading out fairy tales. Until she fell asleep. I made the kids meals and lunch box.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My co workers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about crypto. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over. As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from Accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. A crowd formed to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. The crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. We toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. The CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy Tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone Clapped, looking around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space, someone yelled. Laughter erupted. The CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was ex.

Aria was the girl who'd throw any girl under the bus for five seconds of mail approval. Since freshman year, everyone knew Aria as the girl who'd loudly announced she only hung out with guys because girls are too much drama. She'd sit at the guys table, laugh at every sexist joke louder than anyone else and somehow convinced herself that calling other girls too sensitive made her special. Crazy part was the guys ate it up. Even teachers thought Aria was refreshingly laid back compared to other girls. I remember this one time in PE when a girl complained about the boys snapping girls bra straps. Aria actually stood up and said it's just guys being guys. Stop being such a baby about it. The male coach literally thanked her for being rational. That was Aria's whole thing. She was the cool girl who got it. She she brag about watching corn with the guys, rate other girls bodies with them and called feminism victim mentality. Girls who tried to call out inappropriate behavior became her targets. She'd mock them with fake crying sounds, post their complaints on social media to ridicule them and loudly proclaim how she wasn't like those uptight bitches who couldn't take a joke. During junior year when Natalie reported getting groped at a party, Aria was the first to say Natalie was probably asking for it. Wearing that dress. Guys would high five Her call her basically a dude with tits and she'd beam like she'd won the lottery. When we all came back on Monday after spring break of senior year, we were preparing for the moment Aria went off on a girl and nickered with one of her guy friends. But first period arrives and Aria walks past the guys table without even glancing at them. Not like avoiding them. Aria just walked past like they didn't exist. She sits down at a table full of girls, the same girls she'd spent three years mocking. Vivian, who she'd called a dramatic princess, Dre, who she labeled attention seeking for reporting harassment. Natalie, whose reputation she tried to destroy. The guys started calling her over. Yo, Aria, we saved your spot. She didn't even turn her head. It was like she'd gone deaf to male voices. At first, everyone thought it was some weird joke. Maybe she lost a bet over spring break. Maybe this was some elaborate prank that would turn into the ultimate pick me moment. We were on the edge of our seat waiting for her to burst out yelling, I was right, girls are too much drama. But Aria kept sitting with the girls. She stopped responding to the guys texts, unfollowed all of them on every platform. When Ethan tried to talk to her after chemistry, she looked right through him and kept walking. Days turned into weeks. The guys went from confused to angry. They started Spreading rumors that Aria was on her period, that she turned into a crazy feminist overnight, that she was probably a lesbian. Now. They tried everything to get a reaction. Nothing. Aria just kept sitting with the girls, actually listening when they talked, not interrupting to defend male behavior. The girls were suspicious at first. Had to be some long con to gather gossip for the boys. But Aria never brought up the guys, never defended them. When Jade mentioned feeling uncomfortable about something her boyfriend said, Aria actually responded with, that's not okay. You deserve better. Everyone's jaws broke the floor. Then we all found out what happened, and it was so much worse than anyone imagined. Audrey revealed what she'd heard from her older brother, who went to college with Ethan's brother. During spring break, there'd been a huge party at Ethan's house while his parents were gone. Aria had gone, got drunk and crashed in the guest room. The next morning, she'd woken up early and went to find her phone. Ethan's laptop was open on the kitchen counter and the screen was on a group chat. A group chat with every single guy she hung out with, plus dozens from other schools. The chat was called the Spank Bank. Aria had scrolled up.

So my brother Jake got married like three weeks ago and the whole thing was basically a slap in the face. His wife Megan decided nobody under 21 could come because they were serving alcohol and didn't want any minors getting drunk. I was 19 at the time, which apparently made me some kind of liability. The excuse was complete bullshit and everyone knew it. I don't even drink that much, maybe a beer here and there with friends, but I'm not some alcoholic teenager who's gonna embarrass their precious wedding. But whatever, that's what they decided and my parents just went along with it like always. I asked them to reconsider a few times because honestly it hurt. Jake and I used to be close growing up, shared a room until I was 14, played video games together, the whole thing. But ever since he started dating Megan two years ago, she's basically been calling all the shots. She thinks she's better than everyone because her dad owns some car dealership and she went to private school. After they kept saying no, I just stopped caring. If I wasn't good enough for their wedding, then fine, I wasn't gonna beg anymore. Then last Saturday rolls around and Jake text, it's our family group chat saying he wants everyone to go to some fancy steakhouse to celebrate the wedding. My parents were All excited, talking about how nice it would be to finally celebrate as a family. But I just replied that I wasn't going. My mom called me right away asking why not. I told her the same thing I told everyone else, didn't see the point in celebrating something I wasn't even invited to. She tried to guilt trip me saying it would mean a lot to Jake and that my cousins Becca and Tyler were going even though they didn't get invited either. But here's the thing. Becca is 13 and Tyler is 15. Their parents literally forced them to go. They didn't have a choice. I'm 19. I pay my own phone Bill. I work at Best Buy part time and I'm starting community college in the fall. Can make my own decisions about where I spend my Saturday night. My parents kept trying to convince me all week. My dad even offered to pay for my meal, which honestly just made it worse. Like you couldn't fight for me to be at the actual wedding, but now you wanna throw money at me to show up to the Celebration dinner. The night of the dinner, I stayed home and ordered pizza. I was playing call of duty with my friends when my phone started blowing up. First it was Jake texting me asking where I was and Megan sent me this long paragraph about how disappointed she was that I couldn't be mature enough to support my brother's Happiness. The funniest part is they acted all surprised that I didn't show up. I literally told them I wasn't going. What did they expect? After they got home from dinner, Jake came to my room and tried to have some.

I live in a sketchy little neighborhood where everyone minds their business except for this one dude. Let's call him Rico. Rico is, well, he's like a local cryptid. No one knows where he lives but he appears at 3:00am yelling about government conspiracies, anime girls and how he once fought a raccoon with his bare hands. Classic Rico. Anyway, last night I'm walking back from the corner store with a bag of Hot Cheetos and chocolate milk living my best trashy life when out of nowhere Rico lunges at me like a feral possum in heat. He's screaming something about me stealing his aura. At this point my fight or flight kicked in and apparently my brain chose black magic. See, I've been dabbling in some alternative arts lately. Long story short, I had a transformation Hex saved on my notes app. Don't ask why, just accept it. So mid lunch I screamed the words, clap my hands together and suddenly poof, Rico is no longer Rico. Rico is now Rianna. Pink crop top, cat ears, thigh high socks, eyeliner sharper than my credit score, the full Femboy starter pack. He blinks, I blink. We both stand there for a solid five seconds like, did that just happen? Fast forward to today and uh, I may have listed him on Etsy under Handcrafted Chaos Beings. Someone from Portland bought him within 3 Minutes for 275 plus shipping. Now I'm sitting here sipping my chocolate milk, trying to process the fact that I may have invented a new side hustle.

So my brother Jake got married like three weeks ago and the whole thing was basically a slap in the face. His wife Megan decided nobody under 21 could come because they were serving alcohol and didn't want any minors getting drunk. I was 19 at the time, which apparently made me some kind of liability. The excuse was complete bullshit and everyone knew it. I don't even drink that much, maybe a beer here and there with friends, but I'm not some alcoholic teenager who's gonna embarrass their precious wedding. But whatever, that's what they decided and my parents just went along with it like always. I asked them to reconsider a few times because honestly it hurt. Jake and I used to be close growing up, shared a room until I was 14, played video games together, the whole thing. But ever since he started dating Megan two years ago, she's basically been calling all the shots. She thinks she's better than everyone because her dad owns some car dealership and she went to private school. After they kept saying no, I just stopped caring. If I wasn't good enough for their wedding, then fine, I wasn't gonna beg anymore. Then last Saturday rolls around and Jake text, it's our family group chat saying he wants everyone to go to some fancy steakhouse to celebrate the wedding. My parents were All excited, talking about how nice it would be to finally celebrate as a family. But I just replied that I wasn't going. My mom called me right away asking why not. I told her the same thing I told everyone else, didn't see the point in celebrating something I wasn't even invited to. She tried to guilt trip me saying it would mean a lot to Jake and that my cousins Becca and Tyler were going even though they didn't get invited either. But here's the thing. Becca is 13 and Tyler is 15. Their parents literally forced them to go. They didn't have a choice. I'm 19. I pay my own phone Bill. I work at Best Buy part time and I'm starting community college in the fall. Can make my own decisions about where I spend my Saturday night. My parents kept trying to convince me all week. My dad even offered to pay for my meal, which honestly just made it worse. Like you couldn't fight for me to be at the actual wedding, but now you wanna throw money at me to show up to the Celebration dinner. The night of the dinner, I stayed home and ordered pizza. I was playing call of duty with my friends when my phone started blowing up. First it was Jake texting me asking where I was and Megan sent me this long paragraph about how disappointed she was that I couldn't be mature enough to support my brother's Happiness. The funniest part is they acted all surprised that I didn't show up. I literally told them I wasn't going. What did they expect? After they got home from dinner, Jake came to my room and tried to have some.

The first time she opened her mouth in court, I didn't expect her words to stop a sentencing. We were packed into that courthouse like sardines. The walls felt too close, the benches too hard and my heartbeat too loud. My daughter, Olivia, just 8 years old, sat beside me, swinging her feet. She looked so small in that big room. Her Sunday dress too formal. Her hair and bra if I'd redone three times that morning just to keep my hands busy. Across the aisle sat the man who had taken everything from us. He was just 20, a kid, really. He didn't look dangerous, just tired, like he hadn't slept since the night he pulled the trigger. But I didn't care how tired he looked. My husband was gone and he was still breathing. The widow of the store clerk, my husband's boss, sat silently, her eyes hollow. Next to her was her son, maybe 10, clinging to her arm. I wanted to reach for Olivia's hand, but she was busy twisting the edge of the paper heart she'd made that morning, the one I didn't have the strength to ask about. The prosecutor spoke first, cold, clinical. The victim was an innocent man, a father, a husband. This was a violent, senseless act. Then came the defense. They talked about his upbringing, broken home, drug addicted mother, foster care. They showed pictures of his bruises, his Grades his attempts at rehab. This doesn't excuse the crime, his lawyer said, but we asked the court to consider who he was before he picked up the gun. I hated how calm they all sounded, how measured, like this was just another case. The judge asked if anyone else wished to speak. I felt the weight of the room tilt toward me. Everyone expected the grieving wife to stand, but I couldn't. I'd written 10 different versions of a statement and tore up every single one. The only thing I wanted to say was give me my husband back. And that wasn't an option. Then Olivia raised her hand. I didn't even realize what she was doing until she was already standing, walking to the front like it was show and tell. The courtroom murmured. The bailiff looked to the judge, who gave a small nod. And just like that, my daughter stood before the man who murdered her father. My name is Olivia, she said, her voice small.

That's like saying, oh, yeah, someone caught smallpox on their lunch break. They'll hit you with, don't worry, it's treatable now. Okay, cool. But imagine being the one person who goes to urgent care with a fever, and the doctor walks in wearing a bird mask and carrying a bag of leeches. That's not medical attention. That's a medieval horror show. Like, think about how cooked we are if the plague can just pop back up. We've got A I. Rockets to Mars, and somehow we're still fighting the same disease that wiped out half of Europe. That's not progress. That's a rerun. Every headline feels less like news and more like a countdown. First it was COVID tearing everything apart, then wildfires turning skies orange. Now the plague shows up. Tell me this doesn't feel like end credits.

Back in sixth grade, I was the super quiet kid who barely talked to anyone. I'd sit alone at lunch every day, counting the exact change in my pocket to see if I could afford a milk carton. Most days I couldn't. My parents were going through a messy divorce and money was tight. Really tight. One day I'm standing in the lunch line, stomach growling, holding my last seventy five cents. I punch in my student ID number to buy milk, but the lunch lady, Mrs. Garcia, accidentally hits the wrong buttons instead of my number. She types 0 1 4 8 6 5. The register beeps screen and says approved. I'm confused, but I take my milk and walk away fast before she notices. The next day I'm broke again, so I think what the hell, let me try that number. I punch in R 0 1 4, 8, 6, 5 and boom! It works! Free milk! I start testing it more. Free cookies, free pizza slice! This mystery account never runs out of money. By 7th grade I figured out this had to be some old students account that never got deleted from the system. Maybe they graduated years ago and the school just forgot about it. The account was like a ghost in the machine, invisible to everyone except me. But here's where it gets crazy. I started using it to help other kids too. My friend Jake would slip me a dollar, and I'd get him a full lunch tray using the ghost account. Then Emma started asking, then Tyler. Pretty soon I'm running this whole underground lunch operation. I memorized every item code. Pizza was 1:42. Chicken sandwich was 0 98. Chocolate milk was 2:03. I'd walk through the line like I owned the place, punching in orders for five different kids. The lunch ladies never questioned it because I was always polite and cleaned up after myself. By eighth grade, I had, like, 15 regular customers. Kids would pass me notes in the hallway with their orders written in code. 2 brothers, 1:42. 1 brother, 0 98. Extra 2:03. I charged them half price and kept the rest as profit. Made about 40 bucks a week, which was huge money for a middle schooler. The best part was I never got greedy. I could have bought expensive stuff, but I kept it simple. Basic lunches, milk, cookies. Nothing that would raise red flags. I was like the world's most boring criminal mastermind. I even started doing food deliveries. Kids would pay me to bring lunch to their classroom if they were in detention or couldn't make it to the cafeteria. Teachers thought I was just being nice, helping out my classmates. The operation ran perfectly for almost three years. I fed probably hundreds of kids using this glitch. Never got caught once. Then freshman year of high school happened. The district decided To upgrade their entire computer system. Suddenly, every account needed

So I placed him in the back row. When I was 12, my father told me he had always wanted a son. He said it casually over dinner, like he was discussing the weather. I remember sitting there with my fork frozen midair while my mother scolded him. But he just shrugged and added, boys carry the family name. Girls are just a liability. Those words carved themselves into me. From that day on, I knew where I stood in his world. Beneath the pedestal he reserved for the son he never had. Over the years, he never missed a chance to remind me. When I brought home straight A's, he said, imagine what a boy could have done with that brain. When I got a scholarship to college, he muttered, too bad you'll just waste it when you get married. And when I told him about my first job offer, he looked at me like I'd spoken nonsense. Daughter's success doesn't matter, he said. It's not like you'll be supporting this family. So when I got engaged, I didn't expect him to celebrate. But I wasn't prepared for the cruelty that followed. We were in the living room, my fiance beside me, his hand warm over mine. As I told my parents the news. My mom gasped, beaming, hugging me tightly. My father didn't move. He stared at me for a Long moment, then said flatly, don't look at me. To walk you down the aisle. You're not the daughter I wanted. The silence afterward was suffocating. My fiance stiffened beside me, ready to speak, but I squeezed his hand. I wouldn't let my father steal another moment from me. Instead, I smiled, nodded, and excused myself from the room. But inside, I was burning. That night I called the one man who had quietly been my anchor all these years. My stepdad, Mark. He married my mom when I was 16, after my parents marriage finally collapsed under the weight of my father's bitterness. Mark was gentle where my father was harsh, steady where he was reckless. He never tried to replace my dad, but he was the one who proofread my college essays, showed me how to change a tire, and picked me up from the airport when I moved back home after school. When I asked him if he would walk me down the aisle, there was a pause on the phone. Then his voice broke. It would be the greatest honor of my life. From then on, I didn't think about my father. I poured myself into planning a wedding that reflected me and the man I loved. My father was invited, my mom insisted, and I didn't want to start a war. But I made no effort to include him. Beyond that, he didn't pay a cent, didn't offer any help, didn't ask a single question. For months I didn't hear a word from him. The day of the wedding came, and I felt radiant, wrapped in lace and love. As the music swelled and the doors opened, I looked to my right. There was Mark, standing tall in his suit, tears glistening in his eyes. He offered his arm, and I took it without hesitation. The guests rose, and together we walked toward my future. Halfway down the aisle I caught sight of my father in the back row. He was sitting

My cousin Rachel just buried her husband and two kids last week. Car accident took them all at once. She's left with just her five year old daughter, Emma. And honestly, watching them at the funeral was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So my brother Jake and his wife Kelly show up to our house that morning. Before we head to the church, first thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral, and she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her, but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. At the cemetery, she literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would Mention how hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I now. Now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce, pregnant lady coming through or, baby on board needs to pee.

And honestly, watching them at the funeral was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So my brother Jake and his wife Kelly show up to our house that morning before we head to the church. First thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral. And she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. At the cemetery, she literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would Mention how hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I, no, now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce pregnant lady coming through or baby on board needs to pee.

She mentions McDonald's. Almost got me, but I stay strong. The hardest part is when she stands there just watching me for, like, five minutes. What are you doing? I can feel her staring, analyzing my breathing like she's a sleep scientist. My eyes starts itching. My nose needs to be scratched. My position is uncomfortable, but I can't move.

Remember that older guy they first arrested right after, after Charlie Kirk was attacked? Yeah, the one they let go because he wasn't actually responsible. Well, they just re arrested him. His name is George Zin. He's 71 years old. And according to police documents, he literally admitted that he pretended to be the attacker. Like his plan was to distract everyone from the real person so he could be seen as some kind of martyr. Girl. What? At the scene, he even shouted twice, I did it, now take me down, like he was in a movie or something. But when police asked him where the weapon was, he obviously couldn't answer because he never had one. Later at the hospital, he told officers he was glad he lied because it gave the real suspect time to get away. Like, sir, this is not a game. And, and it gets even worse. When investigators tried to check his phone, he didn't want them to. When they asked why, he literally admitted it was because he used it to look at illegal child content. Who just says that out loud? And of course, when they searched, they found over 20 illegal images and some really disturbing messages. For context, this man has already been arrested multiple times over the last 30 years, mostly for political trespassing. But now he's facing charges for obstructing justice and for what they found on His phone like this went from confusing to straight up disturbing real fast.

I'm holding our Newborn, exhausted, stitches still aching, and he's not answering his phone. Three hours later, the nurse helps me to the lobby with my suitcase and car seat. I'm calling every taxi company when the TV above catches my eye. Breaking news, house fire on Maple Street. That's our street. My heart stops. The camera pans to a house engulfed in flames. The address flashes on screen, 2, 47 Maple street, our house. The room starts spinning. I can't breathe. My daughter is crying now, sensing my panic, and I'm trying to comfort her while my world falls apart. Other people in the lobby are staring, but I don't care. My hands are trembling so badly I can barely hold my phone. A nurse rushes over, asking if I'm okay. But how do you explain that you're watching your life burn on live television? I'm shaking, dialing his number again, right to voicemail again and again. Where is he? Why isn't he answering? My baby girl needs her father. I need her father. The automated message plays his voice. Hey, it's Danny. Leave a message. The same voice that promised me forever. The taxi finally arrives and I'm sobbing, practically falling into the back seat. Please hurry, I beg the driver. My house is on fire. My husband might be inside. The words feel surreal leaving my mouth. Just hours ago, I was in labor. Thinking about bringing our daughter home to the nursery he painted yellow because we wanted to be surprised. The driver keeps glancing at me in the mirror. Ma'am, are you sure you should be out of the hospital? I have to know if he's alive, I whisper, kissing my baby's forehead. She smells like that Newborn sweetness mixed with hospital soap. And I realize she might never know her father. The thought makes me physically ill. When we turn onto our street, like entering hell, fire trucks everywhere, hoses snaking across the pavement, neighbors in their robes watching our entire life burn. The smoke is thick and black and I can taste it even inside the taxi. Missus Ben from next door sees me getting out of the taxi and runs over her face streaked with tears. Oh, honey, thank god you're safe. But Danny, we haven't seen Danny. The fire started hours ago. Hours ago. While I was calling him, while I was waiting, while I was believing his lies about working late projects. My baby starts crying harder like she can feel the heat from the flames. And I pull her blanket tighter around her tiny body. I find a firefighter, my voice barely working. My husband, is he okay? Did anyone get out, ma'am? Nobody was home. But he pauses, looking uncomfortable. His eyes dart to my baby, then back to my face. The fire started from a candle left burning in the bedroom. There were wine Glasses.

I found my work crush share crying in the break room, looking completely stressed. My dad's in the hospital and I need to fly out tonight, but I can't find anyone to watch my kids. My ex won't answer, the babysitter I hired bailed, and I just. I can't afford to miss this flight, but I can't afford anything else either. She leaned against my shoulder, crying even harder. I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said, heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids. Three for at least two weeks. I waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest, around 14, looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work. Camilla, the middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, seven, wouldn't even look at me. They stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Air hug them quickly, told them to be good, and left for the airport. I stood there with three kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. The first morning, I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed, she's not here, you know. You can stop trying. She Said besides, you're not her type. Mom doesn't date guys without kids. We've seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Shares, co workers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps. Everyone wanted to play dad until they realized three kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. From spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings, they hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive two weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy. Be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Sometime within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Just leave me alone, he said, turning away. I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get mad at you or do anything without your permission. Not even tell your mom. But I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't Have a dad! I patted his head and thanked him, walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. The next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rented GTR, strikingly white engine, purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved, wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now? I said loudly, as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop and quickly hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said. I picked up the other two kids and took them to in and out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a helmet full of nachos, and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. Not bad, old man, Camilla said, watching her siblings enjoy the game. We made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard, sent everything to their mom with a caption we wish you were here. After that, things between me and the kids sort of changed. When the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom, I sat beside her bed reading Out fairy tales until she fell asleep. I made the kids meals and lunch box.

I hadn't seen my father in three years when he invited me to Thanksgiving at his new penthouse. After the divorce, he'd thrown himself into his tech company, becoming the millionaire he'd always dreamed of being. Meanwhile, I've been working as a cocktail waitress trying to pay off nursing school debt. Dress nice, he texted. Important people will be there. I arrived in my only designer dress, a black Versace knock off I bought at a consignment shop. Dad answered the door in a tux, sing my cheeks stiffly. Behind him stood a woman my age in diamonds that could pay my rent for a year. This is Brittany, he said, my girlfriend. She looked me up and down with barely concealed disdain. Oh, you brought someone, too. How modern. Before I could correct her, dad steered me toward the living room full of his business partners. I recognized some faces from newspaper profiles, venture capitalists, tech moguls. They're perfectly preserved wives, everyone. This is Aria, dad announced, and immediately got pulled away by his CFO. Britney's friend dripping in pearls leaned over. How long have you been with Mister Reeves? 24 years, I said. Confused. Since birth, actually, she laughed. Oh, honey, you don't have to keep up the act here. We all know how these arrangements work. That's when I realized they thought I was his paid companion. My own father's colleagues assumed I was an Escort. I opened my mouth to correct them when another woman touched my arm between us girls, she whispered, what's your hourly? My husband's friend is looking for someone discreet. I excused myself to find dad, but he was deep in conversation about orderly projections. Brittany intercepted me by the kitchen. Look, she said coldly. I don't care what arrangement you had before, but he's with me now. There's no room for both of us. Arrangement, I sputtered. I'm his, say, David. I know your type. Young, desperate, willing to do anything for money. She looked at my knockoff dress with satisfaction. At least I have class. The Turkey timer went off and dad called everyone to dinner. He'd placed me at the far end of the table, away from him and Brittany. The place card just said guest. During appetizers, the conversation turned to children. Dad's partner asked if he had kids.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around, and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her co worker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. She showed me his Instagram. Tall, brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem? He didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby, and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed after that first dinner. My mom kept inviting him back. Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand, asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about Basketball scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night, after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us. Said she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly. Made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me. We can't keep this up forever, you know? That message hit me like a truck. I realised he was ready to end this whole thing. And I wasn't. Not even close. Instead of Texting back or giving him some weird speech? I invited him over for dinner at my place. Cooked his favourite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over. Set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them. Just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this whole thing started as pretend, but it doesn't feel fake.

When my niece Ava was 7, she had this eerie way of noticing everything. I don't mean normal kids, stuff like colors or toys. she could walk into a room and immediately clock who was fake smiling, who didn't like who and who was pretending to be someone they weren't. She was also the kind of kid who asked why every five seconds, why does that lady talk like that? Why does that man wear a wig? Brutally honest, but in a way that made adults laugh nervously. One weekend, my sister dropped her off at my house while she went out with friends. I was babysitting, which really just meant Ava followed me around all day asking questions and giving unsolicited advice. We were watching TV when a friend of mine, Julie, came over. Julie is one of those people who needs to one up everyone. You say you had a bad day. She had three. You got a new job. She already turned that one down. And worst of all, she hated kids. She called them germ goblins to their faces. But she smiled at Ava and said, aren't you just the cutest little mistake I've ever seen? I froze. Ava blinked, tilted her head and said, dead serious, aren't you just the loneliest adult I've ever met? Julie laughed awkwardly. Wow. Kids say the funniest things. Ava didn't laugh, just sipped her juice box. I still on her. Julie shifted in her seat. Anyway, I was thinking we could go to that new sushi place. I heard the waiters there are actually trained to flirt with you like it's part of the experience. Before I could say anything, Ava said, is that because you have to pay a people to like you? I nearly choked. Julie looked like someone had slapped her with a wet towel. She stood up, muttered something about forgetting she had an appointment and left within two minutes. I turned to Ava stunned. Ava, that was really rude. She just shrugged. She was rude first. A few weeks later, we were at a family cookout. My cousin brought her new boyfriend, Ethan. Ethan had that classic frat boy energy G in his 30s vibe, backward hat, talking over everyone, made a joke about women not understanding sports. Within five minutes, Ava was sitting on the patio coloring quietly until Ethan walked over and looked at her drawing. What's this? A dragon. Looks like a lizard on fire. Ava looked up and said, what's your job? He puffed his chest. I do sales. What do you sell? He paused. Whatever people will buy. She I stared at him and said, so nothing. My cousin snorted into her drink. Ethan went red. It's commission based. You wouldn't understand. Ava looked back at her drawing and said, no, I understand it means you talk a lot but nobody really needs you. The man Was speechless. I swear even the grill stopped sizzling. Later that night, I sat her down and said, you can't say everything you think, Ava. Some things hurt people's feelings. She nodded, seriously, okay, but if someone makes other people feel small and no one says anything, won't they think it's okay to keep doing it? I couldn't argue with that. Last year, Ava turned 11. She's still just as sharp, but now she's figured out how to be kind and savage at the same time. It's honestly terrifying. At her school talent show, one of the moms made a snide comment about another kid's outfit being a little too flashy for elementary school. Ava, without missing a beat, turned to her and said, it's okay. Some people get confused when they see confidence because they've never had it. Everyone started laughing and that mom didn't say another word the entire night. People always say kids are innocent, but I wouldn't mess with Ava.

This year in school, the day came and went and there wasn't a lesson, not even a short mention, not even a moment of silence. It was three, like any other day. And that's what makes it so hard to process, because 9 11 wasn't just another day on the calendar. Thousands of people lost their lives in a single morning. Families were torn apart. Kids grew up without parents. And people who kissed their loved ones goodbye never saw them again. Back then, the whole country promised to never forget. And in classrooms now, it feels like the memory is slipping through the cracks. For students, it isn't even a story they hear anymore. It's like a page that was ripped out of the textbook. And that's the saddest part, because this wasn't some small event in history. It changed airport security and people's lives forever. Pretending it didn't happen doesn't erase the pain. It just erases the memory of the people who went through it. Snoopy.

The courtroom erupted until I stood, handed the judge a two page document and said, check again. Judge simply looked at my wife and burst out laughing. My name is James and three months ago I caught my wife Lauren cheating with her yoga instructor. He filed for divorce immediately thinking she'd hit the Jackpot. Since we've been married for five years, Lauren strutted into that Phoenix courtroom wearing a two thousand dollar dress I'd bought her, confident as hell her lawyer was already calculating his commission on what they thought would be a four million dollar payout for my construction business and dad's inheritance. The whole courtroom was packed. Lauren had actually invited some of her friends to watch what she called James's comeuppance. Been telling everyone for weeks how she was about to become independently wealthy. Your honor, her attorney announced, adjusting his expensive tie. Mrs. Peterson deserves substantial compensation for supporting her husband's career growth during their five year marriage. Lauren actually winked at me from across the room. She thought I was just some heartbroken guy who'd roll over and pay whatever she demanded. Her friends in the gallery were practically grinning waiting for the show. But here's what Lauren didn't know. Six months before I caught her cheating, I'd started noticing weird charges on our joint credit card, expensive dinners at restaurants I'd never been to, hotel rooms Booked during girls trips that didn't add up, designer lingerie, purchases that never made it home. The final straw was when I found a 800 dollar charge at a jewelry store downtown. When I asked Lauren about it, she said she bought herself a birthday present. Problem was her birthday wasn't for four months. So I hired a private investigator named Frank. Best $5,000 I ever spent. Frank followed Lauren for six weeks. What he discovered was worse than I imagined. The yoga instructor was just the latest in a long line of a there's. There was also her personal trainer, a bartender from her favorite restaurant, and even one of my own business partners. Lauren had been using our joint accounts to fund these relationships, expensive gifts, romantic getaways, even paying for her affairs, gym memberships. She'd blown through nearly $50,000 of our money over two years. The two page document I handed Judge Ramirez wasn't financial records. It was Frank's detailed investigation report proving Lauren had been having multiple affairs for over two years, complete with time stamped photos, hotel receipts.

When my 15 year old son Jake came to me asking for cooking lessons, I thought he was finally growing up. He's been dating this girl Emma for three months and wanted to surprise her with dinner. Sweet, right? Wrong. What's her favourite food, I asked, pulling out my recipe box. Well, she loves pasta, but she's allergic to gluten and dairy and tomatoes. Oh, and nuts, actually, most fruits too. I stared at him. What exactly can she eat? Pulled out his phone and showed me a list. I'm not kidding. This girl had a notes app with 17 different food allergies. Shellfish, eggs, soy, corn, most vegetables except like three specific ones. I never seen anything like it. Jake, Honey, are you sure she's not just extremely picky, mom? No. She carries an epi pen everywhere. Last week she had to leave lunch early because someone was eating a peanut butter sandwich two tables away. So we spent the next weekend researching recipes. Everything we found either contained something on her list or tasted like cardboard. I suggested rice with plain chicken, but apparently she's also allergic to poultry. We tried quinoa salad. Nope. She reacts to most herbs and spices. By Sunday night, we'd narrowed it down to exactly one meal, plain white rice with steamed carrots and a specific brand of olive oil she could tolerate That's it for a romantic dinner? This is insane. I told my husband later, what? What does this girl eat normally? Maybe she just brings her own food everywhere, he suggested. The next day, I decided to do some detective work. I picked Jake up from school and saw Emma by the parking lot. She was eating a massive Turkey sandwich with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, basically everything on her allergy list. I drove home in silence, my brain trying to process what I just seen. Either this girl had miraculous healing powers or something else was going on. That evening, I sat Jake down. I need to ask you something about Emma's allergies. His face went red immediately. What a.

I'm holding our Newborn exhausted, stitches still aching, and he's not answering his phone. Three hours later, the nurse helps me to the lobby with my suitcase and car seat. I'm calling every taxi company when the TV above catches my eye. Breaking news. House fire on Maple Street. That's our street! My heart stops. The camera pans to a house engulfed in flames. The address flashes on screen. 2 47 Maple street. Our house! The room starts spinning. I can't breathe. My daughter is crying now, sensing my panic, and I'm trying to comfort her while my world falls apart. Other people in the lobby are staring, but I don't care. My hands are trembling so badly, I can barely hold my phone. A nurse rushes over, asking if I'm okay. But how do you explain that you're watching your life burn on live television? I'm shaking, dialing his number again, right to voicemail again and again. Where is he? Why isn't he answering? My baby girl needs her father. I need her father. The automated message plays his voice. Hey, it's Danny. Leave a message. The same voice that promised me forever. The taxi finally arrives, and I'm sobbing, practically falling into the backseat. Please hurry, I beg the driver. My house is on fire. My husband might be inside. The words feel surreal leaving my mouth just 12. Twelve hours ago, I was in Labor thinking about bringing our daughter home to the nursery. He painted yellow because we wanted to be surprised. The driver keeps glancing at me in the mirror. Ma'am, are you sure you should be out of the hospital? I have to know if he's alive, I whisper, kissing my baby's forehead. She smells like that Newborn sweetness mixed with hospital soap. And I realize she might never know her father. The thought makes me physically ill. When we turn onto our street, it's like entering hell. Fire trucks everywhere, hoses snaking across the pavement. Neighbors in their robes, watching our entire life burn. The smoke is thick and black, and I can taste it even inside the taxi. Missus Ben from next door sees me getting out of the taxi and runs over, her face streaked with tears. Oh, honey, thank god you're safe. But Danny. We haven't seen Danny. The fire started hours ago. Hours ago while I was calling him, while I was waiting, while I was believing his lies about working late projects. My baby starts crying harder, like she can feel the heat from the flames, and I pull her blanket tighter around her tiny body. I find a firefighter, my voice barely working. My husband, is he okay? Did anyone get out? Ma'am, nobody was home. But. He pauses, looking uncomfortable. His eyes dart to my baby, then back to my face. The fire started from a candle left burning in the bedroom. There. Were wine glasses

My son brought his girlfriend, Sarah, home last week. Sweet girl, helped with dishes without being asked. But something about her face haunted me all night. I couldn't shake the feeling I'd seen her before. Then I caught her crying in my bathroom, not sad tear. She was smiling. Said she'd never had a family dinner without screaming or plates being thrown. My heart broke. As I hugged her, I noticed a small scar above her eyebrow. Something clicked in my brain, but I pushed the thought away. A few days later, she came over to help me garden when my neighbor's kids screamed playing tag. She dropped her travel, started shaking, said loud noises just startled her. But I'd seen that reaction before in my old job as a high school counselor. That evening, my son dropped the bomb. He was proposed, wanted to use Grandma's ring, called Sarah the strongest person he'd ever met, said she'd survived things I couldn't imagine. My blood ran cold. I dug through my old files that night, found it. Sarah Miller, age 15, came to my office bruised and terrified, begged me to believe her mom was hitting her. I called CPS once. Her mom fooled them. Sarah begged for help again. But I was swamped with cases, thought maybe she was exaggerating. I did nothing. She doesn't recognize me now. Weight gain, different hair color. But that scar, it's from the day after. She left my office. Her mom threw a glass at her. Yesterday, I finally told my son everything. He just stared at me, said, Sarah still wakes up screaming some nights. Today, I'm meeting her to confess, to say I'm the counselor who failed her, the one who could have stopped her pain but didn't. The ring box is sitting on my table. My son wants to propose to someone I could have saved years ago. Turns out my worst mistake wasn't what I did. It was what I didn't do.

Aria was the girl who'd throw any girl under the bus for five seconds of male approval. Since freshman year, everyone knew Aria as the girl who'd loudly announced she only hung out with guys because girls are too much drama. She'd sit at the guys table, laugh at every sexist joke louder than anyone else and somehow convinced herself that calling other girls too sensitive made her special. Crazy part was the guys ate it up. Even teachers thought Aria was refreshingly laid back compared to other girls. I remember this one time in P E. When a girl complained about the boys snapping girls bra straps. Aria actually stood up and said it's just guys being guys. Stop being such a baby about it. The male coach literally thank her for being rational. That was Aria's whole thing. She was the cool girl who got it. She'd brag about watching corn with the guys, rate other girls bodies with them and called feminism victim mentality. Girls who tried to call out inappropriate behavior became her targets. He'd mock them with fake crying sounds, post their complaints on social media to ridicule them and loudly proclaim how she wasn't like those uptight bitches who couldn't take a joke. During junior year when Natalie reported getting groped at a party, Aria was the first to say Natalie was probably asking for it wearing that dress. The guys would high five her. Call her basically a dude with tits and she'd beam like she'd won the lottery. When we all came back on Monday after spring break of senior year, we were preparing for the moment Aria went off on a girl and snickered with one of her guy friends. But first period arrives and Aria walks past the guys table without even glancing at them. Not like avoiding them. Aria just walked past like they didn't exist. She sits down at a table full of girls, the same girls she'd spent three years mocking. Vivian, who she'd called a dramatic princess. Audrey, who she'd labeled attention seeking for reporting harassment. Natalie, whose reputation she'd tried to destroy. The guys started calling her over. Yo, Aria, we saved your spot. She didn't even turn her head. It was like she'd gone deaf to male voices. At first, everyone thought it was some weird joke. Maybe she lost a bet over spring break. Maybe this was some elaborate prank that would turn into the ultimate pick me moment. We were on the edge of our seats waiting, waiting for her to burst out yelling, I was right, girls are too much drama. But Aria kept sitting with the girls. She stopped responding to the guys texts, unfollowed all of them on every platform. When Ethan tried to talk to her after chemistry, she looked right through him and kept walking. Days turned into weeks. The guys went from confused to angry. They started Spreading rumors that Aria was on her period, that she turned into a crazy feminist overnight, that she was probably a lesbian. Now. They tried everything to get a reaction. Nothing. Aria just kept sitting with the girls, actually listening when they talked, not interrupting to defend male behavior. The girls were suspicious at first. Had to be some long con to gather gossip for the boys. But Aria never brought up the guys, never defended them. When Jade mentioned feeling uncomfortable about something her boyfriend said, Aria actually responded with, that's not okay. You deserve better. Everyone's jaws broke the floor. Then we all found out what happened and was so much worse than anyone imagined. Audrey revealed what she'd heard from her older brother, who went to college with Ethan's brother. During spring break, there'd been a huge party at Ethan's house while his parents were gone. Aria had gone, got drunk and crashed in the guest room. The next morning, she'd woken up early and went to find her phone. Ethan's laptop was open on the kitchen counter and the screen was on a group chat. A group chat with every single guy she hung out with, plus dozens from other schools. The chat was called the Spank Bank. Aria had scrolled up.

It's just a chill guy. But a wasp? A wasp is chaotic, evil. It was created by the universe for the sole purpose of causing problems. It spawns into the world and chooses violence. It has no mission other than to ruin your day. It doesn't even have a reason. It just wants to see the world burn. And don't even get me started on the sting. A bee stings you as a last resort, a final self destruct move. It's a kamikaze. But a wasp will sting you seven times just because you looked at it wrong. It's not self defense. It's a full blown assault for no reason. A bee is a fuzzy, cute little guy. A wasp looks like it was designed in a lab to be the final boss of all insects. It's mean. It's mean. It's a flying needle of pure hatred. One is a productive member of society and the other is a literal winged demon. If I see a bee, I'm cool. If I see a wasp, my soul is leaving my body.

Do you think I enjoy scanning menus just to avoid something slimy, mushy, or with that one smell that ruins my entire appetite? And the absolute worst, when people say, just try it. Wow, thank you for that revolutionary advice. Never thought of that before. You don't understand. It's not about just trying it. Some textures are literally unbearable. Some smells make me want to throw myself into the sun. It's not being dramatic. It's how my sensory system works. So, no, I'm not being rude. I'm not being childish. I'm just trying to eat without feeling like my entire nervous system is under attack. And if that means I stick to the safe foods that actually work for me, then guess what? That's not your problem.

Dad never held back when it came to my looks. Every time I came downstairs wearing makeup, he'd shake his head and say, all that effort for what? You can't paint over ugly. When I turn 16 and started talking about maybe going to prom, he laughed and said, save your money. Nobody's asking you. Anyway. The worst part was how casual he was about it. Like he was just stating facts about the weather. Mom never said anything when he made these comments. He just get this uncomfortable look and change the subject to homework or chores. My little brother Ethan would roll his eyes, but he was only 13 and more interested in his video games than family drama. Dad worked construction and came home every night complaining about his back, his boss or how expensive everything was getting. But he always had energy to comment on my appearance. You inherited your grandmother's nose, he'd say during dinner. Poor girl. At least she found someone desperate enough. When I started my senior year and mentioned maybe going to college, he scoffed. What's the point? You'll just end up pregnant and dropped out anyway. Might as well learn to cook now. The breaking point came three weeks before graduation. I've been accepted to the community college and gotten a partial scholarship for my grades. I was so excited I printed Out the letter and left it on the kitchen table for everyone to see. When dad got home and saw it, he didn't even congratulate me. Instead, he looked at me and said, college won't fix your face. You're still going to be too ugly to find a husband. Better learn a trade that doesn't require dealing with people. That night I called my friend Jake from chemistry class. We've been lab partners all semester and he was one of those guys who is genuinely nice to everyone. He never made me feel weird or ugly like other guys did. Wanna help me prove my dad wrong about something? I asked him. He didn't even ask what it was before saying yes. The plan was simple. Jake would come to Sunday dinner and pretend to be my boyfriend. I coached him on little details about our fake relationship. We've been dating for two months, met in chemistry class and he was planning to study engineering at the state university. Jake was actually really good looking, played soccer and had this confidence that made everything seem easy. Sunday came and I spent extra time getting ready, not because I thought it would make me pretty, but because I wanted dad to see I'd made an effort. Jake showed up right on time wearing khakis and a button down shirt carrying flower it's for mom like I'd suggested. When I introduced him as my boyfriend, Dad's face went completely blank during dinner. Jake was perfect. He complimented Mom's cooking, asked dad about his construction work, and even played video games with Ethan. Afterward, he held my hand at the table and called me beautiful twice, once when he thought dad was listening. Every time dad tried to make one of his usual comments about my appearance, Jake would jump in with something positive. I love how Jenna always knows exactly what she wants, Jake said when dad mentioned I was too picky about restaurants. She has great taste. When dad brought up my unfortunate features, Jake looked genuine.

I stared in shock. What basement? I'm giving birth at the hospital. Oh, honey, Agnes said, reaching across the table to pat my hand. The middle women have been delivering babies at home for five generations. I delivered Brent and his sisters right here in this house. My husband Brent squeezed my shoulder. Mom's delivered over 20 babies for our family. She knows what she's doing. The baby kicked hard against my ribs like it was trying to escape this conversation. We've been living in Brent's childhood home while our house underwent renovations. Not once had anyone mentioned this family tradition. I already have an OB, I said, my voice shaking. We've been planning a hospital birth. I'm high risk because of my blood pressure. Agnes waved her hand dismissively. Hospitals are where people go to die. Your own mother died giving birth in one of those places. The words hit me like a physical blow. My mother had died from complications during my birth. Brad followed me to our bedroom later that night. I was shoving clothes into my overnight bag when he grabbed my wrist. You're overreacting, he said. This is how my family does things. I'm not giving birth in some basement room with your mother playing doctor. His face hardened in a way I've never seen before. If you can't respect our Traditions. Then maybe this marriage was a mistake. I froze. You're threatening divorce? Because I want actual medical care. He showed me our prenup clause 15. In case of divorce due to irreconcilable differences about family values, you forfeit custody rights. My legs went weak. I sank onto the bed. I had no money of my own, no family since my father died last year. Without Brent, I'd lose everything, including my baby. The next weeks became a waking nightmare. Agnes started her preparations, which included drinking foul smelling teas and attending birthing circles with other women from their community. During one session, a woman named Carol pulled me aside. My sister died during one of Agnes home births five years ago. She whispered. They said it was God's will, but she bled out while Agnes refused to call an ambulance. My blood turned to ice that night. I searched online for anything about the Mitchell family. Three women had died during home births in this county over the past 15 years. Agnes name was never mentioned, but the address, this were all in this neighborhood. The headache started the following week. My vision blurred and my feet swelled so badly I couldn't wear shoes. Classic signs of preeclampsia. When I told Agnes, she gave me more herbs and said hospital monitoring would just stress baby. She took my phone the next day, said I was reading too many scary stories online. Brent agreed it was for the best. I Waited until Agnes left for her weekly grocery run and snuck to the neighbor's house. I called my old colleague who worked as a labor and delivery nurse. You need to get to a hospital now, she said, after I described my symptoms. You could have a stroke or seizure. The baby could die. I can't, I sobbed. I'll lose custody if I leave. You'll lose your life if you stay. That night at dinner, I showed Brent the information she had texted. For the first time, I saw doubt cross his face. Maybe we should just get you checked, he said quietly, just to be safe. Agnes slammed her hand on the table. Absolutely not. Doubt is what kills mothers and babies. Faith is what saves them. But Brent held firm. We'll go tomorrow morning, just for a quick check up. I never made it to morning. The contraction started at 2:00am, five weeks early. Brent ran for his keys, but Agnes had already taken them. She locked the doors from the inside with keys only she had. This is meant to be, she said. Only as I doubled over in pain. The baby knows when it's time. Brent pounded on the doors, tried to break windows, but Agnes had prepared for this. Security bars on everything. No phones, no landline in our room. She LED me to the basement, where her birthing room waited. Ancient equipment that belonged in a museum. Stained sheets, the smell of old blood, Poorly masked by incense.

There's no hate about being plus size. In fact, I think everybody is beautiful no matter what. some of these self centered influencers don't seem to think the same. If you know, you have a plus size body, which is perfectly fine if you're healthy, you cannot go into a store like Brandy Melville, which is a store specifically made for petite sizes and teenagers, especially since they only have one size and expect their clothes to fit you. And then you go online to tell the whole world to hate on Brandy Melvo because their petite sizes couldn't fit you. And I think y'all know who I'm talking about. News flash, there's different body types besides plus size that need to have accommodations to their clothes to fit them. Brandy Melville is one of the stores that provide accommodations for petite sizes. It's the same thing as a skinny woman going into a store specifically made for plus size people like Taylor or Lane Bryant and complaining on the internet that the clothes are too baggy on them. Like what did you expect? Not everything is going to accommodate to you whether your ego believes it or not. So no, if you are not petite or close to that body type, you are most likely not going to be able to fit into petite size clothes, which is actually pretty Obvious. Oh, boy, you really solved the case this time, didn't ya, Sherlock? Maybe next time Enola will guide us towards the common sense. That's not even the bad part. The bad part is that the bickering has actually worked. There has been a noticeable increase of Brandy Melvils one size clothes. They're too big on the ones who actually need them to be small. And notice how I'm only talking about Brandy Melville. That's because it's the only store that actually has trendy style, affordable and cute clothing for petite women. The unreasonable hate is taking that away from girlies who actually need it. We need inclusivity. All bodies are beautiful until it's skinny women anyways. Who's a spray 6, 9, 0 U t.

I didn't ask to be mature, but maybe I had to be. It was forced onto me like a prophecy I never wanted. I didn't choose to have a shitty childhood, but I did. I wasn't mature for having my childhood stripped away at such a young age. I just Learned how to survive with the situation I have been put in. I was constantly worried about the adults in my life when they should have been the ones worried about me. And they tell me you're so mature for your age. Why? Because I had two homes and an alcoholic mother and an unstable home life. Because I had to lose a parent at the age of 11 and learn how to navigate girlhood by myself because no one was there when I needed them. I didn't mature off age. I matured off how much I went through, heard, witnessed and experienced because I didn't have a choice.

She'd worked on three bodies with the same marks at the morgue. I was getting my makeup done for my engagement party when the artist, Maya, suddenly stopped applying concealer and stared at my collarbone. She ran her finger along the bruises I'd asked her to cover, then whispered, I've covered these exact marks before. I laughed nervously, saying my fiance Brad and I had just been play fighting, but Maya's face was dead serious. No, I mean these exact marks. Same pattern, same spacing. I worked at a morgue for five years. I've covered these on three different bodies. My blood went cold as she explained the bruises weren't random. They formed a specific grip pattern with four fingers on front and a thumb Mark on back. She'd seen it on three women who'd all died from accidental falls in the past two years. All were engaged, all had these marks covered for their funerals, and all had partners who seemed devastated at the services. Maya pulled out her phone and showed me photos she'd kept from her morgue portfolio. The bruises were identical to mine. Same size, same purple green color, indicating they were about a week old. She said the medical examiner had noted the pattern but couldn't prove they were related to the deaths. Falls downstairs don't leave symmetrical grip marks on collarbones. I felt sick remembering how Brad had Grabbed me last week during an argument about wedding costs. He'd shaken me hard, his hands on my collarbone, saying I needed to learn to listen. Afterward, he'd apologize profusely, bought me flowers, said he'd just been stressed. I believed him because it was so out of character. Maya asked if Brad had ever been married before. When I said no, she pulled up an old news article on her phone. There was Brad, identified as grieving fiance Marcus Torres at a funeral three years ago. Different name, same face. His fiance had died falling downstairs two weeks before their wedding. The article mentioned she'd been wearing a turtleneck in all recent photos. We found two more articles with Brad's photo under different names. Each time a fiance who died from falls. Each time he'd inherited money or property. Each time he'd vanished. Afterward, Maya said the morgue had started calling him the engagement killer, but they couldn't prove anything without the body showing obvious murder signs. I called my sister while Maya documented my bruises with photos. We decided to set a trap. I went home acting normal, but told Brad I'd inherited $50,000 from my grandmother who just died. His eyes lit up, and he suddenly became incredibly affectionate, suggesting we get married sooner, maybe even a lope next week. That night, I pretended to take the sleeping pills he'd started giving me for my wedding stress, but spit them out. I heard him on the phone around Midnight, saying she'll be ready in three days. Same method as before. Make sure the account is set up. He was planning my murder for the weekend. I recorded everything on my phone, hidden under my pillow. At 2:00am, Brad came into the bedroom and stood over me for 20 minutes, just watching me sleep.

I checked my daughter Kate's bank account and saw zeros where $300 should have been. Kate was 16 and worked 20 hours a week at a burger place, but somehow her entire paycheck had vanished. When Kate got home from her shift, I confronted her with the statement, I've been buying stuff for Zoe at school. She has a baby and nobody helps her, she explained. My first thought was that someone was running a sob story scam on my naive daughter, but Kate insisted that Zoe desperately needed help and the baby would suffer without it. The next morning, I gave Kate extra cash and told her to give it to Zoe. Thanks, Mom. Zoe's going to cry when I give her this. That afternoon, I got a call from the school. We need to discuss something serious with you about Kate. Immediately. I rushed to the school, expecting the worst. Your daughter was seen in the parking lot giving another student prescription bottles and cash and what appeared to be a substance deal. We have zero tolerance for substances on school property, and we've already contacted the school resource officer. He turned his computer screen toward me to show the security footage of Kate handing we two orange prescription bottles and money by her car. I felt sick realizing I've been giving Kate money that might have been funding prescription substance stealing. Mr. Hayes said Kate claimed the prescriptions were antibiotics and diaper cream for a baby, but that sounded like a ridiculous lie to cover up selling pills. No teenager carries around multiple prescriptions for a baby they don't have, he said while shaking his head. That's when the school nurse walked in carrying a baby who was caught so hard his tiny body shook with each breath. This is Zoe's son, she said quietly while patting his back. She brought him to my office this morning because he ran out of his breathing medicine and she didn't know what else to do. The principal went completely silent. The nurse explained that Zoe was 16 and had been trying to finish school while raising a six month month old baby alone. Her parents had kicked her out and she'd been living in her car for the past month. The prescriptions Kate gave her were antibiotics for the baby's lung infection and prescription diaper cream for an infected diaper rash that had gotten so bad it was bleeding. Kate had been using her own money to buy them because Zoe couldn't afford the copays. I was proud of my daughter, but also heartbroken. No teenage girl should be living in a car with a sick baby. I told Mr. Hayes I wanted to keep helping Zoe and asked where I could find her. He said she usually stayed in the parking lot after school until security made her leave. After school we found Zoe in The parking lot, trying to change her baby's diaper in the backseat of her car. She saw us coming and immediately started to panic like she was going to drive away. But Kate ran over before she could start the car. It's okay. This is my mom. She wants to help. Please don't call anyone. They'll take him away, and he's all I have left. Zoe begged through the cracked window. The baby was wheezing so loud I could hear it from outside the car, and his little face looked gray. I convinced her to let me sit in the passenger seat so we could talk. She explained that they had been living in this car for over a month, and she washed the baby in gas station sinks at night when nobody was around. I asked about the baby's father and watched her whole body start shaking. His name is Nathan. His dad teaches chemistry here at school, she said so quietly I could barely hear her. I was 15 when Nathan invited me to his college party. He was 21 and kept giving me drinks until I couldn't stand up straight. Then he rocked me. A few weeks later, when I told Nathan I was pregnant, he laughed in my face and said nobody would ever believe trash like me over him since he's premed at the university. She started sobbing and told us that his dad had cornered her after class one day. He grabbed my arm. So hard it left bruises and said, listen, you whore, if you ever mention my son's name in connection with that bastard baby, I will personally make sure you fail every single class and never graduate. I sat there feeling pure rage build in my chest as this child described being threatened and abandoned by adults who should have protected her. As a lawyer, I knew exactly what these monsters had done wrong and how to make them pay for it. I told Zoe she was moving in with us. That night, we packed everything she owned into trash bags and drove them to our house. I set up a crib in the guest room while Zoe took her first hot shower in two months and cried the entire time. The next morning, I filed for emergency child support and demanded a court ordered paternity test. I also reported Nathan to the police for statutory rape. Nathan tried to dodge the test for three weeks by claiming he didn't even know Zoe until the judge threatened to have him arrested when the DNA results came back proving he was the father. The judge was furious that a 21 year old had impregnated a 15 year old and then abandoned his sick child. The court ordered Nathan to pay $28,000 in back support immediately. The District Attorney filed felony statutory RP charges that would require him to register as a sex offender under for life. His dad also got fired. A Week after I reported his threats to the school board, three months later, Zoe was back on track to graduate with her class, and her baby was happy and healthy for the first time in months.

As my kids waited their turn, my mother coldly said, your kids can eat whatever scraps are left in the kitchen. They're not guests here. My sister smirked, and don't forget, I'm staying all week, so you're covering my meals, too, my dad added. Now go set the table. Like a good little servant, I stayed quiet, took my kids to a fancy steakhouse instead and made one phone call. Hours later, they were calling me in panic. It was supposed to be a regular weekend family dinner, nothing fancy, just take out, laughter, maybe a movie. After my parents invited my sister and her kids to stay the week. And naturally, I was expected to come help out like usual. Ever since my divorce, I've kept to myself, but I still tried to maintain some family connection for the sake of my kids. So when it came time to order dinner, everyone was gathered in the living room. My sister's two kids immediately shouted out what they wanted, pad Thai, dumplings and Boba from their favorite spot. My kids waited patiently like they always do. They were next in line, literally. But my mom didn't even glance at them. She snapped, your kids can eat whatever scraps are left in the kitchen. They're not guests here. I looked at her, thought maybe I misheard, but nope. She turned to me, hands on hips, and Added, we already have too many mouths to feed. You know how tight things are right now. Then my sister, smug as always, said, and don't forget I'm staying all week so you're covering my meals too. I blinked. She said it like it was a royal decree. And as if that wasn't enough, my dad, who'd been mostly quiet, barked from the kitchen, now go set the table. Like a good little servant, servant. My kids looked at me, one of them whispered, Mommy, can we just go home? I didn't yell, I didn't cry. I just calmly stood up, grabbed my purse, called my kids over and said, let's go out for dinner. We didn't go to a cheap burger joint. We went to the nicest steakhouse in town, the kind where they bring the drinks on a silver tray and call your kids sir and ma'am. My kids sat wide eyed as waiters pull their chairs out and handed them mini menus. I posted a photo of our dinner, steaks, mocktails, lava cake in the family group chat. No caption, just the picture. But that wasn't a big move. As my kids savored dessert, I made one call, just one, to someone I knew would flip their perfect little dinner world upside down. And a few hours later, my phone exploded with calls from my family, voicemails, texts, missed Facetimes, all of them saying the same thing. What did you do? Let me rewind a bit so You understand the weight of that one phone call. I don't just have a job, I have leverage. For the last six years, I've been quietly helping my parents manage their finances behind the scenes. After my dad's failed retirement investment, they nearly lost the house. I stepped in, used my credit, refinanced in my name and saved it from foreclosure. They never told anyone, especially not my sister. In return, all I asked was respect, not groveling, not grand gestures, just respect and for my kids to be treated like human beings. Clearly, that was too much. The person I called during dessert, my banker, the same one who helped me set up a contingency clause in the mortgage paperwork. The house was saved under my name, but the deal was if certain conditions were breached, namely verbal or emotional abuse of me or my children, I had the option to freeze the financial support and trigger a re evaluation clause with 30 days notice. That clause activated immediately. But I didn't stop there. Before the steakhouse check even hit the table, I logged into the Shared Utilities portal and cancelled my auto pay. That $437 monthly electric Bill, that $220 gas Bill, gone for my account. I also sent a brief email to my parents, HOA, for legal instruction. Please direct all correspondence regarding fees or violations to the property owners only. I am withdrawing from all communication as of today. That triggered a domino effect. None of Them saw coming. By the time my family got home, Belly's full of Thai takeout, probably still laughing about me setting the table like a good little servant. They walked into a house with a blinking red light on the thermostat. My dad must have checked the smart panel because the first voicemail I got said, what the hell is going on? The thermostats blinking. Some warning. We called the electric company and they said the accounts been flagged for pending disconnect because the last payment bounced and no backup method is listed. I thought you had this handled. Then one for my mom. We're not getting hot water. What are you doing? Is this some childish tantrum? And finally, one for my sister, the cherry on top. Seriously, you're sabotaging your own parents because you didn't get to pick dinner? Grow up. You're a bitter, useless drama queen. She had no idea. She had no idea that for the last five months I'd also been paying for the insurance on her car. Not out of generosity, but because it was bundled into a plan that gave me a massive corporate discount, which I just ended. They wanted to treat me like I was disposable. Cool. But now the invisible safety net they've been using to live above their means snapped and I wasn't done yet. The voicemails were one thing, but the panic spilled into the public eye faster than even I expected. The next morning I woke up To six missed calls, a dozen texts, and surprisingly, a Facebook post from my mother that read, some people are so heartless after all we've done for them, they choose to ruin their own family over something petty. We may not have hot water right now, but at least we still have each other. Shame on those who turn their back when we need the most. Translation, she was trying to rally sympathy. Classic tactic, playing the victim for attention. But then my cousin, bless her chaotic, neutral soul, commented, wait, didn't she save your house like 2 years ago? And hasn't she been paying your bills? You told me she was the reason you could still afford groceries. What happened? The thread blew up. A few other family members, ones who'd always quietly noticed the favoritism, started chiming in. One posted a screenshot from months ago of my mom gushing about the miracle of their mortgage being handled and how god sent help just in time. The dots were connecting fast. People were doing the math.

My boyfriend Ethan and I had been dating for two years when this whole thing started. We lived in this tiny apartment together and split everything pretty evenly. He'd grab groceries, I'd cook dinner. Normal couple stuff. But there was always this weird thing where he'd get uncomfortable about anything period related. Like if I left a tampon wrapper visible in the bathroom trash, he'd make this face like I'd left a dead rat there. If I mentioned cramps, he'd immediately change the subject or leave the room. I thought it was just typical guy awkwardness and figured he'd grow out of it. Then last month happened. I was at work when my period started early, which sucked because I had nothing with me. I texted Ethan asking if he could grab some pads from the store since he was already out running errands. Usually went to the grocery store on Wednesdays anyway. His response was immediate. Can't you just get them on your way home? I explained that I was stuck at work for another four hours and really needed them now. I even told him exactly which brand and where they were in the store. He lived at that grocery store. He knew where everything was. Ask one of your co workers, he texted back. I was confused. My co workers were all middle aged men who worked in construction. We were The only company in this tiny office building. I told him this, and his next message made my blood boil. I'm not comfortable buying that stuff. It's embarrassing. I stared at my phone for, like, five minutes. This grown man, who had no problem buying condoms, beer, or even my weird stomach medicine when I had food poisoning, was too embarrassed to buy period products for his girlfriend of two years. I called him Ethan, I literally cannot leave work. I'm bleeding through my clothes. Just ask someone to cover for you or something. There's no one here to cover for me. You're being ridiculous. That's when he got defensive. I'm not being ridiculous. I just don't want to be that guy in the store buying tampons. People will stare. Who cares if people stare? And I need ads, not tampons. Same thing. Look, can we talk about this later? I'm busy. He hung up on me. I ended up having to call my friend Jess, who drove 20 minutes out of her way during her lunch break to bring me supplies. She was furious when I told her what happened. When I got home that night, Ethan was playing video games like nothing had happened.

The finding out was biblical. I show up to practice Thursday night at the regular time, and my three bandmates are sitting in a circle without their instruments, like they're about to hold an intervention. Lead singer says we need to talk about the band's future. Battle of bands is in 10 days, and apparently we need to level up our image. That's when I noticed the drummer's girlfriend standing in the corner holding a bass. My bass, actually, that I let him borrow last week. She's holding it upside down. Lead singer looks at me. Look, you're great and all, but she has the look we need. She's been learning bass for, like, two months. Two months? I've been carrying this band for three years. But sure, let's get the girl who thinks the bass has six strings. They vote 3 to 1 to replace me. Right there with me, watching like I'm getting voted off a reality show. The guitarist, who still can't play an F chord cleanly, actually says, it's nothing personal. Nobody's looking at the bassist anyway. Might as well have someone pretty back there. Nobody's looking at the bassist. I wrote half our songs, but okay, Brad, tell me more about how music works. The drummer's girlfriend tries to be nice. You can still come to the show if you want to support us. Support them? Sure. Let me buy a ticket to watch you play my bass badly. Sounds like a dream. Friday night. I don't argue, don't yell. Just say okay if that's what you all want. The lead singer seems surprised I'm not fighting back. Probably expected tears. Sorry to disappoint. They're already talking about keeping the band name and the set list for battle of bands. Acting like everything's normal. Planning tomorrow's practice like I was never even there. Like I'm already a ghost. Guitarist mentions they'll see me around and I just nod, give them a smile that doesn't reach my eyes, walk out quietly. I can hear them talking about stage positions as the door closes. She'll look great in the back. How the judges will love having something nice to look at. They think this is over. They think I'm just going to crawl away and cry. That's cute. I'm sitting in my car in the driveway and my brain starts doing math. Tomorrow's practice. They kept saying see you at practice tomorrow to each other. But wait, that's my amp the guitarist uses because his sounds like a dying cat. My mixing board that makes our lead singer not sound like he's singing through a kazoo. The mic system I bought with birthday money. The cables, the stands, hell, even the extension cords are mine. I check the battle of bands registration on my phone. The song list they submitted Breaking Chains I wrote that. Midnight Drive wrote that in my bedroom. Phoenix Rising that's literally about my ex boyfriend. I have the notebooks with The original lyrics in my handwriting. The van we use for gigs. Mine. Well, technically my mom's, but she lets me use it. And then it hits me. This is my dad's garage. Dad only lets them practice here because of me. I text him, hey, the band just kicked me out for not being pretty enough. He text back immediately. Are you kidding me? They're banned. I'll change the garage code right now. My dad's the best. They kept saying, see you at practice tomorrow. They actually think they're still practicing here tomorrow. In my dad's garage, with my equipment, playing my songs. The delusion is actually impressive. Next day, five PM, I'm home.

Shawarma quietly arrived in the US back in the 1970s with Middle Eastern immigrants. But for decades, barely anyone outside the Arab community knew what it was. That all changed in 2,012 when Marvel released the Avengers. During the final battle, Iron Man casually mentioned shawarma, an off script moment that wasn't even in the original screenplay. Marvel doubled down and filmed a post credit scene showing the Avengers silently eating shawarma in a half destroyed restaurant. And somehow that awkward scene made shawarma go viral. Searches for what is shawarma exploded. Americans flooded shawarma shops and a food that had spent decades in the background suddenly went mainstream, all because Iron Man got hungry.

And guess who's going to be stuck changing diapers and doing midnight feedings again? Me. I didn't even wait for them to finish their little announcement speech. I walked straight to my room, grabbed my phone and called my grandparents. My hands were literally shaking as I dialed their number. Grandma, it's me. Mom's pregnant again and I can't do this anymore. Can I please come live with you guys, like today? There was silence for about 10 seconds. Then I heard my grandma take a deep breath. She's what?

I threw all my important stuff into two duffle bags, clothes, my laptop, chargers, and most importantly, my passport and birth certificate from my parents filing cabinet.

But now the truth came out. I was 22, just started my dream job as a mechanic, when my phone exploded with hate messages. My 16 year old cousin Sarah told everyone I've been sneaking into her room and got her pregnant. Nobody asked for my side. My mom screamed through tears that I was disgusting, asking how she raised such a monster. Dad just hung up on me. My sister Emma blocked me on everything without a word. Even my grandmother, who practically raised me after my parents divorced, hung up crying, saying she was too ashamed to talk to me. Sarah was the family Princess. Straight A's, honor roll, church youth group bleeder. Every Sunday. I was the high school dropout. Within 24 hours, the whole extended family had turned against me. My aunt posted these long Facebook rants about protecting our children from creeps hiding in our own family. My uncles were leaving voicemails, threatening to beat the hell out of me if they ever saw me again. Cousins I grew up with were sharing screenshots of our old photos with comments like, can't believe I trusted this creep. I waited every single day for police to show up with handcuffs. Every knock on my door made my heart stop. Every unknown phone number sent me into panic attacks, thinking it was detectives or lawyers. I lost everything, piece by piece. My job, At the auto shop because I couldn't focus. Kept making stupid mistakes, showing up late, calling in sick. My boss, Mike, finally sat me down after three months and said whatever was happening at home needed to stay there. But I was too broken to explain. Lost my apartment four months later when I couldn't make rent. Moved in with my buddy Jake. Let me crash on his couch. But even Jake started asking weird questions when family never visited or called. Dude, where's your family? It's been six months, and I've never seen in a single relative. I made up lies about them living far away, being busy, having drama. Dating became impossible. How do you explain why your entire family disowned you? First girl I tried seeing asked to meet my parents after two months. I panicked and told her they passed in a car accident. She was so sympathetic, it made me sick. Second girl saw through everything. When she noticed I had zero family photos in my apartment, no one to invite to anything. She asked Point Blank why I never talked about my family. When I couldn't give her a straight answer, she was gone by morning. Holidays destroyed me completely. Everyone else had somewhere to go, someone to call, someone who cared they existed. I drive past my old neighborhood and see all the cars in my parents'driveway, knowing they were all inside, laughing and eating together without me. I finally moved three states away. To Colorado and started completely over. New job at a different auto shop, new apartment, new friends who knew nothing about my past. For years, I lived like I had no family. Like I just appeared out of nowhere as an adult. Never dated seriously, because I couldn't risk anyone digging too deep into my background. Built walls so high, I forgot what it felt like to trust anyone. Then last month, my phone rang at 11 p m. Unknown Colorado number. Which was weird, because nobody had the

She leaned in closer, but I want it now. And if I'm dating someone inappropriate, then they'll probably offer me some deal to dump you. They always think cash fixes everything. She said it like a joke, like her parents trying to buy her off was funny. So you in? I stared at the money. $500. That's two months of groceries. When do I start? She smiled, different from her usual popular girl smile. Tomorrow I'll pick you up at 7 for dinner at my house. Then she walked out, leaving me with five bills and no idea what I just agreed to. First time at her house, I thought I was being pranked. The driveway went on forever. They had a fountain with actual koi fish. I counted six cars, all different brands. Her parents were in the formal living room. Mom, Dad. This is Dakota. Her mom's smile died. Her dad's eyebrows went up. Hey, up my boyfriend, Victoria added, grabbing my hand. Her palm was sweaty. Yo, Her dad cleared his throat. And what do your parents do, Dakota? Straight to the job question. My mom's a nurse, I said. Didn't mention the second job, cleaning offices. Didn't mention my dad hadn't been around since I was 10. Her mom's smile got tighter. How nice. After that disaster, Victoria set up our routine. Pick me up every morning, hand holding between classes. We need to be seen together, she said. Make it believable. She even made me an Instagram so she could tag me in stuff. But something shifted the second week. She started doing this thing where she'd play with my fingers while we talked, probably for show, but it felt real. We went to this party at her friend's house, mansion, obviously, pool the size of a lake. She stayed by my side all night, introduced me to everyone proudly. This is Dakota, she'd say, like I was someone special, not just the hired help. When some douchebag made a comment about me shopping at target, she shut him down hard. At least Dakota works for his money, she said. What do you do besides spend daddy's cash? The guy had nothing to say. That's when her phone buzzed. My parents saw us this morning, she whispered, showing me the text. They're furious. Her soft hand grabbed mine. Let's go somewhere quieter. We ended up on this balcony overlooking the city. Lights everywhere like stars, but on the ground. She was wearing this dress, blue Probably cost more than my mom's rent, but she made it look easy, normal three months till my birthday, she said random. She turned to me close, really close. Dakota, I need to tell you something. My heart did this weird skip thing. This was it. She was gonna say this was more than just fake, that somewhere in all the pretending it became real like it had for me. What I, I asked. She bit her lip, looked away, then back. My parents want to meet with us tomorrow, both of us. Oh, they said they have a proposal about my trust fund. I bit my tongue so hard it tasted like copper. The meeting was at their house formal dining room. This time felt like a court hearing. Her parents sat on one side us on the other, papers between us, actual printed papers. Dakota, her dad started, you see?

My friends always used to say I had the most generic looking face in our city. You're like the default character in a video game. They joke, and honestly, they weren't wrong. Everywhere I went in Cleveland, people swore they knew me. Hey, don't you work at the grocery store on 55th? Weren't you at my cousin's wedding? It was funny at first. Until it wasn't. One morning, I was working the register at the hardware store when two cops walked in. I figured they were just grabbing supply until they asked my name. The next thing I knew, they spun me around, cuffed me, and started reading me my rights. My co workers froze, customer stared, and I just kept saying, this has to be a mistake. They dragged me out anyway, like I've been caught red handed. At the station, they pulled up the security footage of a gas station robbery from a week earlier. My stomach dropped. The guy on the screen looked exactly like me. Same build, same beard, same haircut. Even the same black hoodie I wore all the time. I almost convinced myself it was me. It got worse. Three different eyewitnesses picked me out of a lineup, no hesitation. That's him, 100%. I didn't even have an alibi that night. I've been home gaming, not texting or calling anyone. No receipts, nothing. To the cops, I was their guy. The evidence stacked up so neatly against Me, it felt unreal. My public defender sat me down and gave it to me straight. With video, eyewitnesses and no alibi, you're looking at serious time. The DA is offering a plea deal. Two years if you plead guilty. If you fight it and lose, you could get 10. I thought about it. Two years for something I didn't do. 10 years if I lost. My chest felt like it was caving in. But I couldn't do it. I couldn't sign a piece of paper saying I was guilty when I wasn't. So I tried something else. I got my hands on the footage and posted it online.

Look, don't come for me until you've heard the full story. My little brother Liam decided to be a hero. Went through my phone, found my search history, you know, the usual stuff, anime, memes, some specific art like fanboys, furry as and other stuff. Instead of being a bro, he printed it, highlighted it, gave our mom a full Powerpoint presentation at dinner. I was grounded for a month. Mom looked at me like I drowned a puppy. I didn't scream. I didn't fight him. That's what he wanted. I got creative. Liam's a gym bro. All he cares about are his games and his loser football friends. His biggest fear, being perceived as soft or cute. So I became his personal stylist against his will. Phase 1, I swapped his manly body wash for my lavender and honey scrub. Within a week, his teammates were asking why he smelled like a bath and body works. The confusion on his face was priceless. Phase 2, Laundry warfare. I started mixing my clothes with his. A lace trim from my fishnets tangled in his jeans. A revealing top snuck into his load. His gray sweats came out smelling like vanilla and shimmering under the lights. The masterpiece was the school charity event. I bought two dozen rainbow bracelets, paid his best friend 20 bucks to tell everyone Liam had a Crush on some goth boy by the bleachers and was changing his vibe to impress him. Overnight, the narrative shifted. Liam wasn't just a jock. He was the sensitive king. His friends thought it was hilarious. They dared him to wear a choker, bought him a skirt as a joke. And the thing is, he didn't hate it. The attention was an addiction. He started asking me for advice, how to walk in platforms, how to do eyeliner. His search history quickly became way worse than mine. He started a TikTok pretty boy Liam. But I wasn't done. I introduced him to my friend Alex. Alex is persuasive. They started talking, hanging out. Then one night, I heard things from his room. Let's just say Alex fully educated him, clapped his cheeks. Now, Liam doesn't just dress the part. He lives it full time. He never apologized for snitching. He probably doesn't even remember these days. He's too busy picking out fishnets and living his best life. So yeah, I got revenge. I didn't just change his clothes. I changed his entire life. And honestly, he's never been happier. You're welcome, Liam. Maybe now mom will finally stop looking at me.

He finally woke up. My husband made me promise we would keep things normal after the baby was born because he read online that babies need to adapt to your life, not the other way around. I agreed because I was 9 months pregnant and too tired to argue about his parenting theories from Reddit. The second we got home from the hospital with our 3 day old daughter, he disappeared into his gaming room. I stood in the hallway holding our screaming baby while he told his online friends he was finally back. I spent the first three months doing every single night feeding while he slept peacefully in our bed. He actually bought special noise cancelling headphones so the crying wouldn't disturb his precious 8 hours of sleep. You look like you're about to drop dead, my sis, Mr Mindy, said when she showed up at my front door. I hadn't seen her since the baby shower because she lived six hours away. When was the last time you ate actual food or slept more than an hour? She dropped her bags and immediately took the baby baby from my shaking arms. You have lost at least 20 pounds and your hands won't stop trembling. She pulled me into the first real hug I had gotten since giving birth. I didn't realize how much I needed a hug. Where is your husband? I Pointed down the hall where he was screaming about someone stealing his kill. Mindy listened for a second, then her whole face changed completely. You have been doing this alone while he plays video games all day, haven't you? Before I could answer, she said, go shower right now while I watch the baby. Then we are going to talk about whatever this mess. She started washing the mountain of bottles that had been sitting for days. You are not doing another night alone while that waste of space pretends you don't exist. I stood under the hot water and cried harder than when I was in labor. When I came back downstairs, Mindy had the baby sleeping. Pee. You look exhausted, she said. Actually looking at my face. When's the last time someone asked how you're doing? I couldn't remember. My husband hadn't asked since we left the hospital three months ago. He'd asked if the baby was fed, if she napped, but never once. How are you holding up? Your husband games every night until 4:00am, Mindy asked, looking at his empty gaming chair. My ex did that. I ended up hospitalized from exhaustion. He didn't visit. That hit hard. Even strangers at the grocery store asked how I was doing, but not him. I came back downstairs from my shower and stopped in the hallway when I heard voices in the kitchen. My husband had actually left his gaming room and was talking to Mindy who was Still feeding our daughter. We don't need any help, he was saying with obvious irritation in his voice. Everything's been fine here without you showing up and judging how we do things. Mindy kept calmly feeding the baby while she responded. Fine. Your wife has lost 20 pounds and hasn't slept in three months. I watched him grab an energy drink from the fridge and crack it open aggressively. She wanted a baby so badly and now she complains about everything he said. Maybe if she wasn't so dramatic about normal mom stuff, we wouldn't have issues. And he finally looked up at him with cold eyes. Normal mom stuff? She told me she thinks about leaving you. His hand froze halfway to his mouth with the energy drink. She fantasizes about packing up and disappearing because raising a baby alone.

My boyfriend Ethan and I had been dating for two years when this whole thing started. We lived in this tiny apartment together and split everything pretty evenly. He'd grab groceries, I'd cook dinner, normal couple stuff. But there was always this weird thing where he'd get uncomfortable about anything period related. Like if I left a tampon wrapper visible in the bathroom trash, he'd make this face like I'd left a dead rat there. If I mentioned cramps, he'd immediately change the subject or leave the room. I thought it was just typical guy awkwardness and figured he'd grow out of it. Then last month happened. I was at work when my period started early, which sucked because I had nothing with me. I texted Ethan asking if he could grab some pads from the store since he was already out running errands, usually went to the grocery store on Wednesdays anyway. His response was immediate, can't you just get them on your way home? I explained that I was stuck at work for another 4 hours and really needed them now. I even told him exactly which brand and where they were in the store. He lived at that grocery store. He knew where everything was. Ask one of your co workers, he texted back. I was confused. My co workers were all middle aged men who worked in construction. We were The only company in this tiny office building. I told him this and his next message made my blood boil. I'm not comfortable buying that stuff. It's embarrassing. I stared at my phone for like 5 minutes. This grown man who had no problem buying condoms, beer or even my weird stomach medicine when I had food poisoning was too embarrassed to buy period products for his girlfriend of 2 years. I called him Ethan. I literally cannot leave work. I'm bleeding through my clothes. Just ask someone to cover for you or something. There's no one here to cover for me. You're being ridiculous. That's when he got defensive. I'm not being ridiculous. I just don't want to be that guy in the store buying tampons. People will stare. Who cares if people stare? And I need ads, not tampons. Same thing. Look, can we talk about this later? I'm busy. He hung up on me. I ended up having to call my friend Jess, who drove 20 minutes out of her way during her lunch break to bring me supplies. She was furious when I told her what happened. When I got home that night, Ethan was playing video games like nothing had happened.

I live in a sketchy little neighborhood where everyone minds their business except for this one dude. Let's call him Rico. Rico is, well, he's like a local cryptid. No one knows where he lives but he appears at 3:00am yelling about government conspiracies, anime girls and how he once fought a raccoon with his bare hands. Classic Rico. Anyway, last night I'm walking back from the corner store with a bag of Hot Cheetos and chocolate milk living my best trashy life when out of nowhere Rico lunges at me like a feral possum in heat. He's screaming something about me stealing his aura. At this point my fight or flight kicked in and apparently my brain chose black magic. See, I've been dabbling in some alternative arts lately. Long story short, I had a transformation Hex saved on my notes app. Don't ask why, just accept it. So mid lunch I screamed the words, clap my hands together and suddenly poof, Rico is no longer Rico. Rico is now Rianna. Pink crop top, cat ears, thigh high socks, eyeliner sharper than my credit score, the full Femboy starter pack. He blinks, I blink. We both stand there for a solid five seconds like, did that just happen? Fast forward to today and uh, I may have listed him on Etsy under Handcrafted Chaos Beings. Someone from Portland bought him within 3 Minutes for 275 plus shipping. Now I'm sitting here sipping my chocolate milk, trying to process the fact that I may have invented a new side hustle. Before anyone asks, yes, Rico. Now Rianna is thriving. The buyer sent me pics. He's got a maid outfit. Now I don't know how to feel.

So there I was, sitting on her bum, massaging her back and making my way down her lower back. I started to move her sweatpants out of the way so I wouldn't get lotion on them. I'm a gentleman, I know. She then just straight up said can you massage my two planets? This is where panic sets in. Butt massage? As in like touching her buttocks? What the hell? Hear a panic? Anyway, I obliged and gave her a butt massage, but that's it. I was so tempted to slip a finger, but I didn't. After the massage, she asked how were you uncomfortable with me getting changed in front of you, but you didn't mind massaging my butt? That was a perfectly valid point in question in which I still don't have an answer. She then got changed in front of me again. Turns out some lotion got on her sweatpants. Was it lotion? Oops. Anyways, at this point I didn't mind and kind of watched a little without being too weird about it. Massaging her butt probably help settle the nerves at this point. After she got changed, we went back to my place. She went to the fridge and open it without asking. I commented, well, you're comfortable. She immediately replied, well, you were comfortable massaging my Butt panic again. What should I say? What did that mean? I didn't know how to respond to this, so I stupidly said well, don't ask again. Who says that anyways? I can't help but feel I messed up and missed my chance. I'm also a massive idiot and don't want to ask her if she likes me straight up. My lack of experience with women also doesn't help. I saw her today but never spoke a word about what happened.

We had a rule in our house. If dad was wearing his red baseball cap indoors, nobody was allowed to talk to him. Not a word. Not even pass the salt at dinner. It wasn't every day. Maybe once or twice a week, he'd come home from work, red cap on, and we'd all just navigate around him. Mom would put his dinner plate down silently. My sister and I would do homework in our rooms. If we needed something from the living room and he was there, we'd wait. I thought this was totally normal. Like how some dads have a don't bother me during the game rule. Ours was just the red cap thing. Friends were over and saw the cap. I'd whisper, Red Cap Day, and they just shrug, and we'd play outside. The rule was so ingrained that I once got in trouble at school for ignoring a substitute teacher. She was wearing a red hat, and my brain just went, don't talk. I couldn't even explain it properly to the principal. Mom enforced it hard, too. my little sister asked dad for help with homework on a red cap day. Mom grabbed her arm so tight it left marks and dragged her to a room. Later, she apologized, but said we had to respect Dad's needs. In high school, I finally asked mom why dad needed red cap days. She got this tired look and Said your father works very hard, and sometimes he needs quiet to decompress. The cap helps us know when to give him space. Made sense to me. Dad's work hard, whatever. I moved out for college, and roommates thought it was hilarious when I'd warn them about my dad's red cap rule. Before this, it's just don't talk to him. If he's wearing it, he's cool otherwise. Last year, I'm home for Thanksgiving. I'm 26 now. Dad's wearing the red cap at dinner. We're all eating silent when my boyfriend, who I'd warned repeatedly, accidentally says, sir, could you pass the Turkey? The entire table freezes. Dad's hand stops halfway to his fork, his jaw clenches. Then he just get it's up and leaves. Doesn't say a word, just walks out to the garage. Mom starts crying. Actually crying at Thanksgiving dinner. My boyfriend is mortified, apologizing profusely. I'm pissed at him, but also confused by Mom's reaction. It's just the stupid cap rule. Why is she sobbing?

After I exposed my bullies on YouTube, I thought it was strange that my principal wanted to delete my channel instead of punishing the bullies, but I just discovered what the school is really hiding. You see, I knew there had to be some reason the principal was siding with the bullies. It makes no sense to punish me for just making a video talking about my horrible experience. The girls had literally gotten away with no punishment. But apparently, I'm not allowed to upload anymore. So I did some digging onto the school website, hoping there might be something that connected the principals with those girls. I looked around for hours, and at first I found nothing. I honestly didn't even know what I was looking for. But eventually, I finally realized the truth behind his actions. I click onto the donor's page, and at the very top, I see a face that looks really familiar. But when I see the name, that's when it hits me. This was the mother of my school bully. And the principal had just been trying to keep his top donor happy this entire time by excusing her daughter for the bullying. Think I'm gonna let this slide? Nah. I'm exposing my school to the whole world. Help boost the video by subscribing.

I've had a horrible adult acne since college, like the kind where people ask if you've tried washing your face. As if I haven't spent thousands of dollars trying everything. Finally found a dermatologist who put me on this intense prescription routine, tretinoin, clindamycin, gel, the works. Cost me $300 a month, even with insurance. But it was worth it because my skin finally cleared up. My sister in law, Emma was staying with us for two weeks before her wedding. She kept asking about my skincare routine, touching her own face and sighing. I told her it was mostly diet changes and patience, plus regular dermatologist visits. She wasn't buying it, though. She'd follow me to the bathroom and peek at my medicine cabinet while I brushed my teeth. One morning I caught her reading the labels on my prescription bottles. I told, told her those were serious medications and my dermatologist specifically warned me never to share them. She just laughed and said she was curious. Emma has always been the type to borrow clothes without asking, so I should have seen this coming. The night before her wedding, she was freaking out about a tiny pimple on her chin. I offered her some of my gentle face wash, but she said it wasn't strong enough. I went to bed around 11, exhausted from helping with Last minute wedding stuff. The wedding was beautiful. Emma looked absolutely radiant in all the photos. Her skin was literally glowing better than I'd ever seen it. Everyone kept commenting on how perfect her complexion was. Even the photographer mentioned it. I felt genuinely happy for her. Two days later, she posted on Instagram with this long caption, thanking god and a miracle product for her wedding day glow. She tagged the location as our house and wrote about discovering the most amazing skincare routine. My stomach dropped. I checked my medicine cabinet immediately. My tretinoin tube was.

Like, great, now she thinks I pulled up to run a 5 star GTA heist on her pantry. Like the other day I'm hanging at my friend's place after school, but dude has the appetite of a hummingbird, one granola bar and he's full. And I don't wanna ask for food at his house. I want him to offer like a normal human. So I start dropping hints. A McDonald's commercial comes on and I'm like, dang, a Mcchicken would go crazy right now. Then I get up to grab a glass of water and stare into the fridge like I'm touring an art museum. I even ask, yo, do you guys ever do pizza rolls here or. Nah. He just shrugs and says, I'm not really hungry. Oh, didn't ask about you. But then, and when he finally picks up on the hint, instead of having his mom make us a snack, he just leans toward the kitchen and yells, mom dog is hungry. Can you make him something? Like, bro, why would you say it like that? Now she either thinks my parents don't feed me at home or I'm a big back here to clear out her fridge. Yeah, do I secretly want to inhale all the food in their house? Yes, but that's beside the point. Subscribe.

Everybody gets a Valkyrie helm! Trading community would collapse overnight, and I'd be sitting there laughing in my new virtual mansion made entirely of Roblox. Next, I troll every game. Imagine joining Brookhaven and tipping the pizza delivery guy 10 million robux just for bringing me one slice. Or jumping into Pet Simulator X and dropping so much robux that the game physically breaks trying to process. Developers would worship me like a god. And don't even get me started on avatars. My character would change outfits every two seconds. Golden suits, diamond drip, entire outfits made of cash. Basically I'd be the Elon Musk of Roblox. Except instead of rockets, I'm launching myself into every server and flexing until the game crashes.

Clearly, a lot of people don't know what generations are. So let me explain it. Generations are simply based on the year you were born. Gen Z is 1997 to 2,012. It doesn't matter if you think you had a Gen Z childhood or you relate more to people in Gen Z. And I think a lot of kids are embarrassed to be a part of Gen Alpha, but it is completely normal for older generations to make fun of younger generations. And a lot of the kids saying that they had a Gen Z childhood didn't really have one at all. For example, I saw a kid saying 2015 should be considered Gen Z because they liked fidgets when they were younger and lived through Covid. I don't know about you guys, but most of Gen Z grew up on squishies and slime. And considering that they would have only been 5 to 6 years old during Covid, like how would they even really experience how Covid was like considering the era of it on TikTok and stuff? And just because you don't make skippity toilet jokes doesn't make you Gen Z anyways. I hope these kids learn to just accept it. By the way, this.

Phoebe walked up to me at my grocery store job and said, I need you to pretend to be my abusive ex. I dropped the can of soup I was stocking. Phoebe Kang, valedictorian, going to Harvard in the fall. Perfect grades, perfect life, perfect everything. What the hell? How was she doing? Talking to me? My actual ex won't leave me alone, she explained, glancing around nervously. He keeps showing up at my house, my work, everywhere. But he's 6 4 and on the foot all team. She pointed to herself. I'm 5 2, and my parents think I should just handle it diplomatically. They don't understand that Austin's not taking no for an answer. So where do I come in? You're bigger than him. If he thinks I'm with someone who could actually fight back, maybe he'll back off. I've seen you loading trucks in the parking lot. You're not exactly small. I look down at myself. Yeah, I was bigger. Worked construction summer since I was 16. Built like my dad before he took off. What's in it for me? I'll help you pass calculus. You're failing, right? I've seen your test scores posted outside Morrison's classroom. She wasn't wrong. I needed that credit to graduate. Mom was already stressed enough without me not walking across that stage. Fine. But we do this my way. What do you mean? We're not pretending you're with some psycho. We're Showing him you're with someone who actually respects you. What's the difference? Everything. First time we met up, I told her the plan. I pick you up from school, walk you to your car, hold your hand in the hallways. Normal boyfriend stuff, but visible. That's it? That's it. No drama, no threats, just presents. Phoebe looks skept. Austin's not going to back down from hand holding, trust me. The first two days were weird. Phoebe's friends kept staring at us like I was some zoo animal. Whispers followed us down every hallway. What's she doing with him? Isn't that the kid who works at Save Mart? Phoebe heard it, too. I could see her jaw tighten every time someone made a comment. You don't have to do this, I told her after some girl made a crack about my thrift store jacket. Yes, I do, she said, squeezing my hand tighter. Sure enough, Austin showed up the third day. Massive dude, varsity jacket, looked pissed as hell. Who's this? He demanded, getting right in Phoebe's face like I wasn't even there. I stepped between them. Calm. No

I never invited anyone to my house, not because I didn't want to, but because I knew they'd ask questions I didn't have good answers for. Why do you only have one bed for the whole family? Why does your fridge only have condiments and expired milk? Why does it smell like gas near the heater that barely works? And Jake, this new kid in my 7th grade class, invited me to his birthday sleepover. I almost said no. My parents always said sleepovers were too risky, too weird. But really, they just didn't want anyone figuring out how broke we were. But something about Jake seemed different. He wasn't trying to impress anyone, so I said yes. Walking into Jake's house felt like stepping onto another planet. The carpet was thick and soft under my feet. I'd never walked on carpet that wasn't stained or worn down to the backing. Their bathroom had two sinks, two. I stood there staring at them like they were alien technology. Jake had his own room with L E. D strip lights around the ceiling, a t V. Mounted on the wall, and his own mini fridge full of soda does and energy drinks. I must have stared at that fridge for too long because Jake laughed and said I could grab whatever I wanted at home. We shared one flat Coke between three people when mom could afford it, when Jake opened his dresser to pick pajamas. I actually asked out loud, you have choices. He looked at me weird but didn't say anything mean, just tossed me an extra pair of pajamas that were cleaner than anything I owned. Dinner wasn't even fancy, just burgers and fries from the grill outside. But I couldn't remember the last time I ate something that wasn't microwaved leftovers or ramen noodles. The burger had real lettuce, tomatoes, cheese that was actually melted, pickles that weren't from a jar we'd had for six months. Finished my plate in like three minutes and then just sat there, not sure if asking for more would be rude. Jake's mom noticed and said, want another one? There's plenty. I nodded so fast I probably looked desperate. When we went to sleep, Jake gave me my own blanket, my own pillow. I didn't even know how to act at home. Me and my little brother shared a twin mattress on the floor, switching sides every night because one side was closer to the broken heater that made this horrible rattling noise. I couldn't fall asleep for hours, not because I was uncomfortable, but because everything was too comfortable, too quiet, too warm, too safe. That's when it hit me that the biggest luxury wasn't the food or the room or even having my own space. It was peace. Just pure, simple peace. The next morning, Jake's mom made pancakes from scratch, not the boxed mix we sometimes Got on birthdays, but real pancakes with syrup that wasn't corn syrup in a fake maple bottle. She asked if I wanted chocolate chips in mine. I said yes, even though I'd never had chocolate chip pancakes before. I didn't tell Jake the truth about my house, but when his mom drove me home and I saw him looking at our apartment building with its busted front door and the smell of cigarettes in the hallway, I felt ashamed, not of my family, but of the whole situation we couldn't control. Before I got out of the car, Jake asked if I wanted to hang out again next weekend, not at his house, just at the park or something. I realised he wasn't being nice because he felt sorry for me. He just liked hanging out. That sleepover changed something in me. I started working harder in school, not because I wanted to get rich or anything dramatic like that, but because I wanted to feel that peace again. I wanted a life where I didn't have to worry about whether the power would get shut off or whether we'd have enough food for the week. Now I'm in college and I have my own dorm room, my own bed, my own desk, my own mini fridge.

At first, we tried writing backwards so if teachers or classmates tried to peek, they couldn't read it quickly. But then we realized if our notebooks ever got confiscated, it would still be easy to figure out. So we went full spy mode. We created a whole alphabet, gave each letter its own symbol, and memorized it. Suddenly, we could write full conversations in class, and no one had a clue what we were saying. Bye, high school. We didn't really use it anymore, but I still had all the symbols memorized. One day, I was in class journaling about a crush in the back of my notebook. I wasn't disrupting anyone, but my teacher noticed how into it I was and decided to call me out. He goes, what, are you writing a book over there? Clearly those aren't notes. I froze, snapped the notebook shut immediately. Thankfully, he just made a little joke and moved on. But there was no way I was about to risk my thoughts about this girl being read out loud to the whole class. So the next time I journaled, I switched back. Back to the secret language. To everyone else, it looked like I was just doodling random symbols, but to me, it was the perfect cover. Fast forward. Years later, I find those old notebooks again. And the problem. I had thrown away the Only translator we ever made. Which means all the secrets I wrote as a kid are now locked away forever. In a language even I don't understand anymore. Guys, what do I do?

So my husband Jake has this obsession with sweet tea. Not just any sweet tea, his grandmother's recipe that he makes every single Sunday in this massive gallon pitcher. He uses like 2 cups of sugar, which is disgusting if you ask me. But whatever. The man drinks it all week long and god forbid anyone else touches it. I'm talking about a grown man who literally wrote his name on the picture with a Sharpie. Now, here's where it gets weird. Jake works construction and every morning he fills up this be up old thermos with his precious tea. But here's the thing, he never actually drinks it at work, never. He just carries it around like some kind of security blanket, brings home still full every single day. I thought this was just some quirky habit until last Tuesday when I was doing laundry and found his work shirt absolutely reeking of alcohol. Not beer smell, not wine, straight up vodka. And this wasn't the first time. I've been finding these shirts for weeks. But I kept making excuses. Maybe someone spilled something on him. Maybe he walked past a bar. Stupid stuff like that. So Wednesday morning, I decided to follow him to work. I know how that sounds, but I had to know what was going on. I parked across the street from his job site and watched him for like 20 minutes. The guy pulls out. His thermos unscrews the top, pours out all the sweet tea onto the ground, and then pulls out a bottle of vodka from his lunch box and fills the whole thing up. I sat there in my car just staring. My husband of eight years was day drinking at work. You sing his grandmother's sweet tea recipe as a cover story. The same man who lectured me about having a glass of wine with dinner because someone needs to be responsible in this house. But wait, it gets worse. That night at dinner, he's going on and on about how hard work was, how his back hurts, how his boss is being unreasonable. Meanwhile, I'm looking at him knowing he spent the day sipping vodka out of a thermos while operating heavy machinery. The guy was literally putting people's lives at risk. I didn't say anything that night because I was still processing it. But Thursday morning, same thing. Friday, same thing. By this point, I'm wondering how long this has been going on and how I never noticed. Then I remembered all those times he came home exhausted and went straight to bed at like seven PM all those weekends he was too tired to do any. The man wasn't tired. He was hungover. Sunday comes around and here he is making his weekly batch of sweet tea, humming to himself like nothing's wrong. He's going on about how his grandmother would be so proud that he kept the Tradition alive, how it's the one thing that gets him through the work week. I'm standing there watching him stir in cup after cup of sugar, knowing full well that this, he is just going to end up on the ground while he fills that thermos with vodka. That's when I snapped. The second he went upstairs to shower, I grabbed that pitcher and poured every last drop down the kitchen.

I don't know if anyone else feels this, but it's like I'm never really alone, but I'm never really chosen either. I'm the one people are happy to see in the group, the one they'll talk to if no one else is around, the one that's nice and easy to hang out with. But when it comes down to it, I'm never the person someone calls first. I'm not the best friend, the ride or die, the person they can't wait to text when something happens. I'm just there, always included, never prioritized. It's such a mind fuck because technically I have friends, I'm not isolated, but I still feel invisible. I'll be standing right there laughing with everyone and still feel like an extra in my own life. Like I'm the supporting character in their story, but never the main one in mine. And yeah, it hurts. It fucking hurts watching everyone else pair off, have their person while I'm the one left lingering in the background. I'm good enough for everyone, but not special enough for anyone.

Every Sunday for 15 years, my grandmother made the same announcement at family dinner. When I pass away, everything goes to whoever visits me most. She tap her cane on the floor and smile like she just revealed state secrets. This turned my entire extended family into vultures. My Aunt Rachel drove three hours every Tuesday I just to vacuum Grandma's living room. Uncle Steve called twice daily asking about her arthritis. My cousin Jennifer moved back from California and started doing Grandma's grocery shopping. They all hated each other but pretended to be saints around her. Meanwhile, I was banned from inheritance discussions. I liked guys chicken nuggets and grandma made it crystal clear that sinners don't deserve family money. She changed the subject. Whenever I entered rooms, my cousins would smirk and whisper about how I'd be working at McDonald's while they lived in luxury. But here's what none of them knew. I actually loved spending time with grandma. Not for money, she'd already told me I wasn't getting any, but because she was genuinely funny. When she wasn't performing for the Inheritance Hunters, while they argued over who deserved what, I'd sneak over on Wednesday nights to watch old movies and eat ice cream. Grandma would relax completely. When it was just us, she'd tell dinosaurs jokes from the two thousand BC and complain about how fake everyone was being. She even started Asking about my boyfriend and seemed genuinely interested in our relationship. I never mentioned these visits to anyone because I knew they'd think I was gaming. After she passed last year, the whole family gathered for the will reading. Rachel brought a calculator. Steve wore his funeral suit from 1995. Jennifer had already started planning her European vacation. They were practically drooling as the lawyer opened the envelope.

My boyfriend Jake had been the same couch potato for three years. The guy who needed me to open pickle jars was suddenly doing push UPS at 6:00am. When I asked what sparked this change, he just shrugged and said he wanted to get healthy, but something felt wrong. It start started small. He bought protein powder and left it on the kitchen counter like some kind of trophy. Then he got a gym membership to this fancy place across town instead of the Planet Fitness two blocks away. When I suggested we work out together, he got weird and said he preferred going alone to focus. The red flags kept piling up. He started showering immediately after coming home from the gym, which seemed normal until I realized he never smelled like sweat. His gym clothes were always perfectly clean, too. One day I decided to surprise him with lunch at his gym. The guy at the front desk looked confused when I asked for Jake. Turns out he hadn't been there in weeks. I confronted him that night. He got defensive and said he switched gyms because the other one was too crowded. When I asked which gym, he stuttered and said some random name I'd never heard of. That's when I knew he was lying. So I did what any suspicious girlfriend would do. I followed him the next Tuesday I watched him drive past three different gyms and pull into the parking lot of a Starbucks. Through the window I saw him sitting across from this blonde girl who definitely wasn't just a workout buddy. She was laughing at everything he said and touching his arm constantly. My heart was pounding as I watched them for 20 minutes. When she got up to leave, he grabbed her hand and kissed it. I wanted to storm in there and cause a scene, but instead I waited. He came home an hour later with this fake exhausted look, complaining about how intense his workout was. I played along for two more weeks, watching him lie to my face every single day. He even started buying workout supplements and leaving them around the apartment as props. The worst part was when he'd flex his non existent new muscles and ask if I noticed any changes and I got clever. I told him my friend Emma was looking for a new gym and asked for his recommendation. He panicked and said his gym was full and not taking new members. When I offered to call and check, he quickly said they had a waiting list and it wouldn't be worth it. That weekend Jake said he was going to a special Saturday morning workout class. Instead, I followed him to the same Starbucks. This time they were holding hands across the table and looking at something on her phone together when he Leaned over and kissed her forehead. I knew I had enough evidence, but I didn't confront him yet. I had a better plan. I went home and researched the girl on social media. Found her Instagram through the Starbucks location tag. Her name was Ashley, and according to her posts, she'd been seeing someone new for the past month. The timeline matched perfectly with Jake's and fitness obsession. Monday night, I casually mentioned

My phone buzzed at 2:00am with a text that made me sit straight up in bed. Remember that favor you owe me? I need you to be my boyfriend at my sister's wedding this Saturday. Pick me up at four PM wear navy. It was from Poppy, the girl who saved my entire college career three years ago. I hadn't spoken to her since graduation when I drunkenly promised her anything, anytime, after she spent an entire semester tutoring me through chemistry for free. Without her, I would have lost my scholarship and dropped out. Now she was calling in that favor and honestly, being someone's fake boyfriend for a day seemed like a small price to pay. Plus, if I was being honest with myself, I'd always wondered what it would have been like to actually date. When I picked her up that Saturday, Poppy answered the door looking absolutely stunning in an emerald dress that made her green eyes even brighter. But her expression was all business. She handed me a typed sheet of paper titled Our Relationship Details with bullet points about our first date, how long we've been together and my supposed favourite things about her. Eight months, she said, adjusting my tie without making eye contact. We've been dating eight months. You call me pop sometimes. We met at a coffee shop. Her voice was mechanical like she was reading a grocery list. During the drive, she explained The situation, my parents keep trying to set me up with their business partner's son at every family event. He's perfectly nice, but I'm just not interested. This will shut them up for a while. The whole ride, she was silent. Then when we arrived at the venue, she took a deep breath, grabbed my hand and suddenly transformed into a completely different person. Ready, babe, she said with a bright smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. The ceremony was beautiful. I caught Poppy wiping her eyes during the vows and without thinking, I handed her my pocket square. She looked surprised but took it, whispering thanks so quietly, I almost missed it. During the reception, I found myself forgetting this was an act. When her uncle made a toast, I instinctively put my arm around her shoulders. When the music was too loud to hear her cousin's story, I leaned down so she could whisper it in my ear, her breath warm against my neck. Her grandmother cornered us by the dessert table, pinching my cheeks and telling Poppy in a stage whisper, this one's much better than Adrian. Poppy went rigid at the name, but I squeezed her hand and smoothly changed the subject to Grandma's famous apple pie recipe. The couple's dance was when everything shifted. Poppy was stiff in my arms, counting steps under her breath like she was solving an equation. Hey, I whispered, pulling her closer. Just follow me. Stop thinking so hard. She looked up at me and for a moment, her guard completely dropped. She melted into me, her head finding that perfect spot against my shoulder. We swayed together as the song played and I found myself hoping it would never end. Then during the bouquet toss, she caught it by accident when it bounced off another girl's hands, the crowd cheered, but Poppy immediately handed it to the girl beside her, laughing it off. Just superstition anyway, she said. But I noticed her looking at the flowers longingly as the other girl walked away. Her sister pulled me aside while Poppy was in the bathroom. Thank you, she said, squeezing my arm for making her happy, if it's just for tonight. The words stuck with me. As the night wound down, I realized I wasn't acting anymore. When I looked at her laughing with her cousins, I felt a pull in my chest that had nothing to do with owing her a favor, driving her home. I couldn't keep it in anymore. Poppy, I know this was just repaying a debt, but tonight felt real to me, really real. She went completely still in the passenger seat when I pulled up to her apartment. She practically jumped out of the car. You did great. Perfect. Fake boyfriend. We're even now. The words came out rushed and cold. She was already at her building's door before I could respond. I sat there for five minutes feeling like an idiot before Driving home the next morning, Poppy's sister texted me, you left your.

My sister called me a bad mom until her kid told me the truth. When Emma asked if she could dye her hair blue for her 13th birthday, I said, sure, it's just hair, right? She'd been begging me for weeks, showing me Pinterest photos of these gorgeous ocean blue highlights. Target. We picked out some semi permanent dye that would wash out in a month. She was so excited she could barely sit still while I painted the streaks in our tiny bathroom. The next morning at breakfast, she kept flipping her hair and grinning at herself in the toaster reflection. I made her favourite blueberry pancakes and she kept saying how the blue and her hair match the berries perfectly. honestly the happiest I'd seen her since her dad moved out last year. But when we showed up at my sister Beth's house for Sunday dinner, everything went sideways fast. Beth took one look at Emma and her face just dropped. She pulled me into the kitchen while Emma was playing with her cousins and started going off about how irresponsible I was being. What kind of message does this send, she whispered harshly, gesturing toward the living room. She's going to look like some delinquent at school. I tried explaining it was just temporary hair dye, that Emma was still getting straight A's and playing violin. But Beth wouldn't hear it. She kept shaking her head and muttering about how I was clearly struggling as a single mom and needed to set better boundaries. The whole dinner was awkward after that with Beth making passive aggressive comments about certain parenting choices every time Emma's hair caught the light. When we got home that night, Emma seemed deflated. She kept touching her hair and asking if I thought it looked stupid. I reassured her it looked amazing, but I could tell Beth's reaction had gotten to her. That's when I decided to call my mom to vent about the whole thing. Mom listened patiently while I ranted about Beth being judgmental. Then she got quiet for a moment. Honey, she said carefully, there's something you should probably know about your sister's situation. Apparently, Beth had been calling.

So my brother Jake got married, like, three weeks ago, and the whole thing was basically a slap in the face. His wife Megan, decided nobody under 21 could come because they were serving alcohol and didn't want any minors getting drunk. I was 19 at the time, which apparently made me some kind of liability. The excuse was complete bullshit, and everyone knew it. I don't even drink that much. Maybe a beer here and there with friends, but I'm not some alcoholic teenager who's gonna embarrass their precious wedding. But whatever. That's what they decided, and my parents just went along with it, like always. I asked them to reconsider a few times because, honestly, it hurt. Jake and I used to be close growing up. Shared a room until I was 14, played video games together, the whole thing. But ever since he started dating Megan two years ago, she's basically been calling all the shots. She thinks she's better than everyone because her dad owns some car dealership and she went to private school. After they kept saying no, I just stopped caring. If I wasn't good enough for their wedding, then fine. I wasn't gonna beg anymore. Then last Saturday rolls around, and Jake, our family group chat, saying he wants everyone to go to some fancy steakhouse to celebrate the wedding. My parents were all Excited, talking about how nice it would be to finally celebrate as a family. But I just replied that I wasn't going. My mom called me right away asking why not? I told her the same thing I told everyone else. I didn't see the point in celebrating something I wasn't even invited to. She tried to guilt trip me, saying it would mean a lot to Jake and that my cousins Becca and Tyler were going even though they didn't get invited either. But here's the thing. Becca is 13 and Tyler is 15. Their parents literally forced them to go. They didn't have a choice. I'm 19, I pay my own phone Bill, I work at Best Buy part time, and I'm starting community college in the fall. I can make my own decisions about where I spend my Saturday night. My parents kept trying to convince me all week. My dad even offered to pay for my meal, which honestly just made it worse. Like, you couldn't fight for me to be at the actual wedding, but now you wanna throw money at me to show up to the Celebration dinner? The night of the dinner, I stayed home and ordered pizza. I was playing call of duty with my friends when my phone started blowing up. First it was Jake texting me asking where I was, and Megan sent me this long paragraph about how disappointed she was that I couldn't be mature enough to support my Brother's happiness. The funniest part is they acted all surprised that I didn't show up. I literally told them I wasn't going. What did they expect? After they got home from dinner, Jake came to my room and tried to have some

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years, and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or asked if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size, and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this great smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend, she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler, who said she was being a total bitch, but I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my Fitness Pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped. Getting coffee with extra syrup, and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better, and she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

It's easier that way, isn't it? People see the smile and assume everything is fine. No awkward questions, no forced explanations, no pity looks, just normal. Because explaining how you really feel, that takes energy you simply don't have. And truth be told, not everyone understands. So you wear the smile like armor, convincing the world that you're okay. But deep down, you're tired. Carrying invisible weights that no one sees, navigating battles that don't show on the surface. And still you keep smiling. Not because you're happy, but because sometimes it's the only way to make it through the day. But here's the truth. You don't always have to smile through it. It's okay to let someone in, even if it's just one person. Sometimes talking won't fix everything, but it can lighten the load. Just enough to breathe again. And that. That's a start. If you've made it this far, hit that follow button. Because this account. It's for you.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I, I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or asked if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this great smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler who said she was being a total bitch. But I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my fitness pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped. Getting coffee with extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better. And she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

When my sister Amanda decides she wants attention, she'll claw it out of someone else's skin if she has to. At family gatherings, she was the one who'd loudly announce my bad grades, failed driving test, or awkward crushes to get a cheap laugh. I always took it because that's just Amanda, but she crossed the line. Last month I woke up to 30 notifications on Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. My phone was blowing up with laughing emojis, L M A O s, and tags. Turns out Amanda dug into old photo albums and posted my most humiliating pictures. Me with braces and acne. Me dressed as a clown for Halloween at 12. Me crying at my middle school graduation because my speech went wrong. Captioned some people never grow out of being pathetic. She tagged me in every single one. At first I was mortified. I got DMs from co workers, college friends, even my boss, all seeing my sister publicly roast me like I was still a kid. I called her immediately. Delete them, I said. She laughed into the phone. Relax, it's just for fun. Everyone thinks it's hilarious. You humiliated me in front of everyone I know. Oh, come on, she sneered. You've always been the boring one. Let me have a little fun. It's not like you have a reputation to ruin. That last line hit hard and something in me snapped. Amanda has always painted herself as the golden child, but I knew things about her that she didn't want public things buried in county court records. Things her husband's family had no idea about. I opened my laptop and went digging. It didn't take long to find exactly what I was looking for. Amanda's shoplifting arrest from six years ago. She had been caught stealing makeup and jewelry from a department store. She avoided jail time, but had to pay fines and attend a petty theft class. It was all public record, just forgotten. And then there was her DUI from three years ago, the one mom begged me not to tell anyone about. Amanda had spent a night in jail, had her license suspended for a year, and attended mandatory AA meetings. Both cases public record. She wanted to play dirty. Fine. The next evening, I made a post on Facebook. Simple.

I had to choose. I'm at work on a Tuesday morning when my wife texts having contractions. Think this is it. Meet you at Memorial Hospital. I'm grabbing my car keys when my phone rings. It's my twin sister and she's sobbing. My water just broke. I'm scared. I'm headed to Valencia Hospital. Please come. I freeze in the parking lot holding the phone up to my ear. My wife is 39 weeks pregnant with our first baby. My sister is only 34 weeks, making this a high risk pregnancy. And her boyfriend left her two months ago after they found out the baby has down syndrome. The hospitals are 45 minutes apart in opposite directions. I stand there like an idiot while the two most important women in my life need me in two different places. I drive toward my sister first because she's alone and high risk. I call my wife from the car. When I tell her, she's crying but says she understands. My sister texts, contractions getting stronger. Nurse says I'm 4 cm dilated. I think back to when my sister held my hand through our dad's death when we were 16. She's been there through my depression, my divorce from my first marriage, everything. She chose me as her birth partner months ago when her boyfriend bailed. My wife texts, contractions five minutes apart now. Then I'm scared, too. Then we promised We'd do this together. My wife has an anxiety disorder and she's been planning this birth for three years. Made a playlist, wrote letters to the baby. We practice breathing exercises every night. I'm driving when my breathing starts coming in faster and my hands are shaking so bad, I swerve into the other lane. A truck horn blares and I yank the wheel back, nearly going off the road. I have to pull over on the highway shoulder just so I can gasp for air. Full panic attack, head and hands on the steering wheel trying to breathe. My phone explodes with calls. I answer them one by one. My mother in law is screaming, we just got to the hospital. Where are you? How dare you leave her right now? My father in law texts, get back here now. Man up and support your family. Then my mom calls, we're getting on a plane but that's five hours away. You need to step up as her big brother. Your sister has nobody. The baby might not survive. My dad texts, blood comes first. Your wife has family, your sister has no one. I sit there for a moment longer, breathing. Then I call both hospitals. My sister's nurse says she's asking for you. She's terrified. My wife's nurse told me she's progressing fast. Where are you? My phone's at 5% battery from all the calls at this point. The last thing I hear is my mother in law. Saying, if you're not here when that baby comes, don't bother coming home. My phone dies right there in my hands, still vibrating with another call coming in. I choose to go to my sister because she's alone and at higher risk. I speed toward her hospital, crying the whole way. I run into the emergency room, asking for her delivery room. The nurse looks confused.

There's no hate about being plus size. In fact, I think everybody is beautiful no matter. some of these self centered influencers don't seem to think the same. If you know you have a plus size body, which is perfectly fine if you're healthy, you cannot go into a store like Brandy Melville, which is a store specifically made for petite sizes and teenagers. Especially since they only have one size and expect their clothes to fit you. And then you go online to tell the whole world to hate on Brandy Melville because their petite sizes couldn't fit you. And I think y'all know who I'm talking about. News flash there's different body types besides plus size that need to have accommodations to their clothes to fit them. Brandy Melville is one of the stores that provide accommodations for petite sizes. It's the same thing as a skinny woman going into a store specifically made for plus size people like Taylor or Lane Bryant and complaining on the internet that the clothes are too baggy on them. Like what did you expect? Not everything is going to accommodate to you, whether your ego believes it or not. So no, if you are not petite or close to that body type, you are most likely not going to be able to fit into petite size clothes. Which is actually pretty obvious. Oh boy, you really solved the case this time, didn't ya Sherlock? Maybe next time Enola will guide us towards the common sense. That's not even the bad part. The bad part is that the bickering has actually worked. There has been a noticeable increase of Brandy Melville's one size clothes are too big on the ones who actually need them to be small. And notice how I'm only talking about Brandy Melville. That's because it's the only store that actually has trendy and style affordable and cute clothing for petite women. The unreasonable hate is taking that away from girlies who actually need it. We need inclusivity! All bodies are beautiful. Until it's skinny women anyways. Who's a spray 6 9 O U T ho ho ho!

The daycare called me at work saying Alara had been inconsolable for two hours. This wasn't normal. Alar was the easiest baby ever. Never fussed unless something was seriously wrong. In her eight months of life, she'd only had maybe three real crying episodes. Once when she had an ear infection, once when she fell and bumped her head, and once when she had a stomach bug. Each time, I could calm her down within minutes just by holding her. But according to the daycare worker on the phone, nothing was working. They'd tried feeding her, changing her, rocking her, even putting her in the swing she usually loved. The woman sounded frazzled, almost annoyed. She's disrupting the other children, she said. Maybe you should come get her early today. I asked if I could talk to Miss Caren, the head caregiver, who Alara absolutely adored. Alara would light up every morning when she saw Miss Caren's face. But the woman said Miss Caren was busy with the other kids. Something about that phone call bothered me. The entire drive over, the daycare worker hadn't sounded concerned, just irritated. Like Alara crying was more of an inconvenience than something to worry about. I've been using Sunshine Daycare for six months, ever since I went back to work. It came highly recommended, had great reviews online, and Miss Karin seemed to genuinely care about all The kids. She'd send me photos throughout the day of Alara playing and smiling. She remembered details about Alara's routine, her favorite toys, even the face she made when she didn't like her food. I trusted this place completely. When I told my boss I had to leave for a family emergency, he didn't question. I grabbed my keys and practically ran to the parking garage. The entire 15 minute drive, I kept trying to think of what could be wrong. Maybe Alara was getting sick and I just hadn't noticed the signs this morning. Maybe she was having a growth spurt and needed more food. Maybe she missed me more than usual today. But deep down, something felt off. Alara had never been described as in consolable by anyone, ever. Even my mother in law, who had strong opinions about everything, always commented on how calm and happy Alara was. When I pulled into the daycare parking lot, I immediate we knew something was wrong. I could hear crying from the parking lot. Not just Alara, but multiple babies screaming. It sounded like chaos inside. In all the months I've been dropping Alara off and picking her up, I'd never heard anything like this. Usually there might be one child fussing here and there, but this sounded like every baby in the place was upset. I walked up to the front entrance and tried the door. Locked. Which was weird because pickup wasn't for another hour and a half. The daycare was supposed to be open until six PM and it was only 4:30. I knocked on the front door and waited. No one came. The crying was getting louder and I could definitely pick out Alara's.

My six year old nephew absolutely destroyed my sister at Thanksgiving dinner. And honestly, she deserved it. My sister Emma has always been obsessed with appearances. Perfect makeup, designer clothes, constantly taking selfies. She's the type who spends two hours getting ready just to go to target. At family dinners, she'd always make these passive aggressive comments about everyone else's life choices. So we're all sitting around the table last Thanksgiving, Emma shows up an hour late because she had to get her nails done. She's wearing this ridiculous white dress to a family dinner where we're eating gravy and cranberry sauce. Classic Emma move. She immediately starts her usual routine. Comments about how mom's stuffing has too much salt this year. Mentions how Uncle Rick should probably lay off the dinner rolls. Makes this big show of only eating tiny portions because she's watching her figure. Then she turns to my brother Jake, who just started community college. So, Jake, still taking those little classes? When are you going to get a real degree? Jake just stared at his plate. The kids working two jobs to pay for school. Emma kept going. She asked my cousin about her starter apartment and wondered when she'd get a grown up job. She even made a comment about dad's old truck in the driveway, saying it was embarrassing. The whole time, my nephew Tyler was just sitting there eating his Turkey And watching Tyler's Jake's six year old son. Super quiet kid, usually just plays with his food and doesn't say much during adult conversations. Emma was on roll. She started talking about her new boyfriend's BMW and how they're looking at condos downtown. Really laying it on thick about how successful she is compared to everyone else. Then she made her biggest mistake. She looked at Tyler and said, Tyler, sweetie, make sure you study hard in school so you don't end up like your daddy, okay? The table went dead silent. Jake's face turned red. Mom literally gasped. Dad put down his fork and just stared at Emma. But Tyler. Tyler just looked up from his mashed potatoes, blinked those big innocent eyes, and said in the sweetest voice ever, Aunt Emma, why?

Yeah, the number that every little brain rotted kid has been spamming these past few months like it's a sacred ritual to summon the meme god. Turns out this isn't just some random number. There's actually a lore behind it. It all started off with the meme No. 69 way back in 2000, 2,018 to 2,020. Just like 6, 7, kids were always pointing out the No. 69, except this was more immature and freaky. So what does this have to do with 6, 7? You guys remember why 6 is afraid of 7? It's because 7 ate 9. Yeah, after seeing 69 being in the spotlight, 7 got hungry for the same attention and literally ate 9. It then overtook 9 spot and became 6, 7. Now kids are spamming 6, 7 like they're hoping to be blessed with Seven's power. Everything literally makes perfect sense now. Or maybe I just need therapy.

And now you're catching up with your old coworker's cousin's best friend's dog trainer, bro. How? And the worst part, you remember every single detail about them, too. You're like, oh, yeah, he used to play soccer with me back in year five. Then he moved to Canada, but now he's back, and his sister married my other friend's uncle's barber. Like, what? My brain can't even hold my own passwords, and here you are remembering family trees. Meanwhile, I know, like, three people, and two of them are my own family. Honestly, at this point, you're not even my friend. You're a walking contacts list, bro. Got more connections than Wi Fi. Like, who are you, the president? If you have a friend like this, or if you are this friend, I got one question. How? Because Your social battery must be unlimited

The next thing I knew, they spun me around, cuffed me, and started reading me my rights. My coworkers froze, customer stared, and I just kept saying, this has to be a mistake. But they dragged me out anyway. Like I've been caught red handed. At the station, they pulled up the security footage of gas station robbery from a week earlier. My stomach dropped. The guy on the screen looked exactly like me. Same build, same beard, same haircut, even the same black hoodie I wore all the time. I almost convinced myself it was me. It got worse. Three different eye witnesses picked me out of a lineup, no hesitation. That's him, 100%. I didn't even have an alibi that night. I've been home gaming, not texting or calling anyone. No receipts, nothing. To the cops, I was their guy. The evidence stacked up so neatly against Me, it felt unreal. My public defender sat me down and gave it to me straight. With video, eyewitnesses and no alibi, you're looking at serious time. The DA is offering a plea deal. Two years if you plead guilty. If you fight it and lose, you could get 10. I thought about it.

Me and my older brother, Nate, were best friends growing up. He was everything I wanted to be. Tough, protective, always getting me out of trouble when I messed up. When I broke Mrs. Wilson's window playing baseball, Nate took the blame and got grounded for two weeks. When I failed my math test, he spent hours helping me study for the retake. We shared everything. Our tiny bedroom, video games, even a fake ID when we got to college. Our parents died in a car crash when I was 15. The whole world felt like it was ending. But Nate stepped up immediately. He was only 22, barely an adult himself, but he became my legal guardian without hesitation. He dropped out of his senior year, got two jobs, working at a warehouse during the day and cleaning offices at night. I never heard him complain once. He'd come home exhausted, covered in sweat and dust, but still help me with homework. When other kids got allowances, Nate made sure I had lunch money. When I wanted new sneakers, he worked overtime to get them. He never made me feel like a burden, even though I knew I was draining every penny he earned. I graduated high school with decent grades and got into State College. Nate was so proud, he cried at my graduation. Said our parents would have been proud, too. He kept working those same two jobs to pay My tuition, living off ramen noodles and hope. I promised him someday I'd pay him back for everything. Four years later, I landed a good job at an accounting firm, finally making real money. First thing I did was try to give Nate Cash, but he refused. Said seeing me succeed was payment enough. That's just how he was. Never wanted anything for himself. Last Thanksgiving, I brought my fiance Emma, home to meet him. She'd heard all my stories about my amazing big brother who raised me. They got along great. Laughing at old photos, Nate telling embarrassing stories about when I was little. Everything felt perfect. Later that night, after Emma went to bed, Nate asked me to sit down. He looked nervous, fidgeting with his coffee cup like he used to do when we were kids. And he had something serious to tell me.

My wife Stephanie waited until we were eating dessert at Cassie and Paul's house to drop this on me. We should swap partners every Thursday, she said, and I literally watched her put her hand on Paul's thigh under the table. I saw it. Cassie saw it, too, and her face went blank. What? I asked because I honestly thought I heard her wrong. Partner swapping. We date each other's spouses. She said it like she was talking about switching cars for the weekend. Paul kept staring at his plate and wouldn't make eye contact with me. It's already decided, Stephanie said. Thursday nights, you take Cassie out, Paul takes me. I felt my chest get tight. When did they decide this without me? This is insane, I told her. Then she leaned in close and whispered, room 2:37 last Tuesday when you were at work. My whole body went numb. She was telling me she'd already cheated and now wanted my permission to keep doing it. So are you in or not? She asked louder. I looked at Cassie, and she was crying without making any sound. Fine, I said. Let's swap partners. Stephanie smiled like she just won something. But then I noticed Cassie had stopped crying completely. That should have told me something right there. When the first date night came around, Stephanie spent forever getting ready. She put on this Red dress I've never seen before that she'd been hiding in our closet. Paul's car was already running in our driveway when I left. I brought Cassie white roses because I remembered she mentioned liking them once. Her hands shook when she took them. Paul? Never. She started, then stopped. At dinner. She pushed her food around and barely ate anything. You okay? I asked. Paul's been different, she said quietly. For months, even before. Then she stopped talking again. I reached over and touched her hand. Before what? Nothing. Forget I said anything. But then her phone lit up with Stephanie's name, and she turned it face down immediately. When I got home that night, Stephanie was already there. Her hair was all messed up and her lipstick was smeared on the wrong side of her mouth. How was Cassie? Good. How was Paul? Then she started telling me everything they did. The hotel room, the balcony, what they did against the wall. Kept getting louder with each detail. Stop, I told her. Why? Don't you wanna know? No. Her face got all twisted up. Well, I'm telling you anyway. She kept going with more details while I pulled out my phone and texted Cassie, thank you for a lovely evening. Stephanie saw my screen and threw her wine glass at the wall. It shattered everywhere, and I just stood there looking at her. The next week, I had to pick Cassie up because her car broke down. Out Of nowhere. Paul was supposed to drive me, she said, looking confused. Forgot at dinner. She had way too much wine. Can I tell you something? She asked, and her eyes looked glassy. Tuesday afternoons. That's when it started. My heart started racing. What started? She covered her mouth with her hand. Nothing. Forget it. But Tuesday was when Stephanie had mentioned the hotel and we both knew what she meant. Then we had to go to Stephanie's parents house for dinner. Stephanie showed up late and I could smell Paul's Cologne all over her clothes. Her mom noticed it right away and her face changed. Is that men's Cologne? The whole table went quiet. We're sharing partners with Cassie and Paul, I said. Every week. Her dad dropped his fork and it made this

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years, and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding, when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size, and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort, and then suggested I might want to start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend, she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler, who said she was being a total bitch, but I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my Fitness Pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped. Getting coffee with extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. First month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better, and she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

My half sister Heather and I never really got along. It doesn't help that Heather's mom hates me and my mom. She has always tried to one up me. She thinks she is better than me and tells all our cousins that I am insecure because my dad chose their family over my mom and me. She never fails to make all my life events all about her, like my graduation party where she announced that she was accepted into a prestigious university. Now my fiance and I got engaged last month and had our engagement party this Saturday. We had planned it originally as a casual formal event, nice dresses, but not I am going to the Met Gala. Nice. More like we are going to a good restaurant. Nice. Anyway, my cousin hits me up saying she has to show me something. It was the picture of the dress. Heather was gonna wear this dress, Jesus Christ. It can only be described as opulent. It was long and white, strapless with sewn in crystals and golden accents. I'm pretty sure it's a wedding dress, but I can't be 100%. This made me really mad. I started texting people telling them that there had been a change of plans and instead of a casual formal, I decided to have a costume. Party. My mother's side is crazy for Halloween, so they were immediately on board. I told my father via text and asked him to relay the message to Heather and her mother, knowing full well that he would forget or leave it to the last minute. Saturday comes along and guests start showing up. Most of them are in costumes and some didn't have time to get one. We just provided them with fun hats and cheap wigs. My fiance was dressed as bubbles and I was dressed as.

Or what colour is the grass? Like, your shirt is purple. And then they say, no, it's blue. Like, bro, it isn't my fault that I didn't know that because I see purple. And then as soon as they know it, they'll tell their friends like, bro, did you know he's colorblind? And then in one second, everyone comes and asks me questions. And then there is that one time I was with a friend, we got out of the store, and I see a purple bicycle with green wheels. So I say, bro, what is that combination, bro? Like, purple and green? And then he says, bro, that's blue. And I say, no. And then he calls an old man and says, sir, that bicycle is blue, right? And that gentleman says, yes, and then he says, well, that guy says it's purple. Or one time I saw someone drawing with gray, and I asked him, dude, why are you coloring with gray? And he says, uh, bro, it's dark green.

Classmates, teachers, even random strangers. I was like, you're so pretty to anyone who'd listen. I remember one time at the grocery store, there was this cashier who always looked super tired, like she hated her job. I walked up with my mom and just said, you're really pretty. She froze for a second, then her whole face lit up. She laughed, thanked me, and even gave me a sticker from the I thought I just unlocked some Secret Life hack. Say nice things, make people happy. My mom eventually pulled me aside and was like, why do you keep doing that? And I told her, because it makes people smile. Like it was that simple to me. I just like making people happy for a second. And now these nine year olds in my comment section are calling me cybiao. Like, bro, I don't even know what that means, but judging by the way they're spamming it, I don't think it means.

Let's go around the room, introduce yourself and tell us one fun thing you did this summer. Suddenly you're on a timer. You have to invent a fun thing that sounds cool but not like you're bragging. It's a high stakes social mission. And there's always that one kid who says something like, I spent a month backpacking through Europe and then I went scuba diving in Australia, bro. Oh, calm down. We get it. You're a world traveler. Then you have the goofball who just lies for no reason. He'll say, I fought a shark and won. Wrap it up, bro. No one believes you. And you always have the person who just says, I slept, bro. That's the most low effort answer in human history. But the worst part is when they make you play two truths and a lie. It's a like interrogation. Some kid will be like, I've met the president, I have a pet alligator and I can speak fluent French. And you know for a fact two of those are probably true because this school is a fever dream. This isn't a fun get to know you game. It's a social experiment in anxiety and deception.

It's just a chill guy. But a wasp. A wasp is chaotic evil. It was created by the universe for the sole purpose of causing problems. It's spawns into the world and chooses violence. It has no mission other than to ruin your day. It doesn't even have a reason. It just wants to see the world burn. And don't even get me started on the sting. A bee stings you as a last resort. A final self destruct move. It's a kamikaze. But a wasp will sting you seven times just because you looked at it wrong. It's not self defense, it's a full blown assault for no reason. A bee is a fuzzy cute little guy. A wasp looks like it was designed in a lab to be the final boss of all insects. Mean. It's mean. It's a flying needle of pure hatred. One is a productive member of society and the other is a literal winged demon. If I see a bee, I'm cool. If I see a wasp, my soul is leaving my body, I'm completely cooked.

I giggled nervously. Um, yeah. Why? No, no, no, no, no! Oh! She suddenly screamed while walking as far away from me as possible. I just laughed because moms can be so weird sometimes. But the next day, my daughter came home from school crying. Mommy! Leah said her mom said she can't talk to me anymore. Leah was her best friend. I immediately took out my phone and texted her mom, asking if everything was okay. No response. I texted Emily's mom, one of the other girls in her trio. Still nothing. I had just managed to calm my baby girl down when the pizza arrived. Usually our delivery guy is the Appatron 5,000. But tonight he just set the box on my doorstep and practically ran away. George, you forgot your tip! I yelled, waving a 20. Just kept going. The next few days were insane. At my daughter's soccer practice, Helen saw me walking towards her and held her phone to her ear. No one had even called her, Helen, what's going on? She mouths sorry and walked faster. We used to complain about our husbands together. Parents were whispering and showing each other something on their phones when I walked by. They quickly put them away. By Thursday, my daughter was refusing to go to school. They moved my desk away from everyone else. Teacher said it was for space reasons, but there's like ten feet between me and Leah now. I tried to bring her to the hairdresser to cheer her up, but when the woman saw me coming, she closed early. No apology. Just flipped the sign and pulled the blinds. My phone buzzed. It was my landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry. Rent can wait this month. This was the same man who charged me a fifty dollar inconvenience it's fee when I paid rent at 12:00am instead of midnight. Then the birthday party. Emily sleepover. My daughter found out that everyone was invited except her. She was having such a bad panic attack that I had to call a hospital. Mom, what did I do? Emily is my best friend. Enough was enough. I called the school office. Something is happening to my daughter. She's being systematically excluded and I need answers right now. The counselor called back within an hour, but her voice was off. Like she was choosing every word carefully. Missus Callahan, we just wanted to check in about your home environment. Is everything safe? Anyone new spending time around your daughter? What? What are you even asking me? I think it's best if we discuss this in person. Can you come in tomorrow morning? No. You'll tell me right now why my daughter is being tortured. Long pause. The principal will explain everything tomorrow. Beep. She hung up. Then at 11 p m. An email from My gym membership terminated effective immediately. I've been going there for 5 years. The owner knew me by name. I was trying to figure out what to do when my daughter crawled into my bed at 2:00am, sobbing, Mommy, am I ugly? It took everything in me not to burst into tears. The lunch lady wouldn't look at me today. She just pointed at my tray. I finally caved. On Saturday morning, I found myself walking towards the principal's office while being escorted by a security guard. Other parents there for Saturday sports hold their kids against the walls as we passed. One mom literally shielded her son with her body, like we were dangerous. In his office, the principal locked the door behind us. The click was so loud in the silence, he walked to the windows and twisted the blinds shut. My daughter grabbed my hand tighter. Please sit down. I'll stand. What is this about? He sat at his desk, fingers hovering over his keyboard, then pulled them back. Mister Griffin, you're scaring me. Missus Callahan. He was looking at his screen, not at me.

He sacrificed everything to give his kids a better life than he ever had. He sold his truck to pay for my sister's emergency surgery when insurance said they wouldn't cover it. He worked triple shifts for six months straight to afford my brother's rehab. He even quit his job when I was getting bullied so he could homeschool me for a year. Three weeks was all the doctors gave him after finding tumors everywhere. The 40 years of breathing factory chemicals to support us finally caught up to him. They set him up with home hospice care so he could die in his own bed. He called all of us kids together on Facetime. Since my siblings lived states away, all he wanted was at least one day with each of us before he died. Nothing complicated, he said with that raspy voice the cancer gave him. Just come sit with your old man one more time. I promised him I would be there every single day since I lived 20 minutes away. My siblings swore they would come in immediately to take their turns with him. The morning my sister was supposed to arrive, dad woke up at five in the morning to get ready. The morphine made him dizzy, but he shaved, combed his hair and put on his good flannel shirt anyway. He spent three hours making her favourite cinnamon rolls from Scratch. He had to keep sitting down to breathe, but he finished them. I got there at nine to help him set everything up. Then he sat in his recliner by the window and watched for her all morning. Around 10, he said maybe her flight was delayed, but we both knew that wasn't true. By noon, she still hadn't shown up. When he called her, it went straight to voicemail, and she left all of his texts on read. Around dinner time, she finally texted him back and said her law firm had an emergency. But two hours later, she posted photos from a beachside restaurant where she was having dinner with her friends. I held his hand while he cried for the first time since mom died. The cinnamon rolls sat on touched until I threw them away after he cried himself to sleep. My brother was supposed to come the next day. Dad had me pull out the photo albums from when we were kids. He kept touching the pictures of my brother's first day of school and telling me stories I'd heard a hundred times. My brother called that morning and said, dad, I'm definitely coming, but this client meeting got moved to noon, and it's a million dollar deal, so just give me a few more hours. Dad waited in that recliner all day, but he never showed up. That night, I saw my brother posting videos from a bar. He was doing shots with Co workers and celebrating some deal they closed. Dad asked me to put the photo albums away, looking defeated. Least I have you, he whispered. The next morning, his hospice nurse, Nancy, came for her regular visit and immediately knew something was wrong. She checked his vitals and told me he was declining much faster than expected and might only have hours left. Dad asked Nancy to call my siblings for him. I sat there holding Dad's hand while she begged them to come say goodbye to him while they still could. She put it on speaker so dad could hear everything. My sister spoke first. Oh, my god. Is he seriously doing this right now? Class like dad. He always has to make everything about him. This is just another guilt trip, and I'm not falling for it. My brother jumped in next. He chose that toxic factory job over spending time with us, and now he wants us to drop everything because he. He's dying from it. That is actually hilarious. Then my sister said the worst thing possible. Tell him, I said. Thanks for the college money, but I am not wasting my vacation days to watch him rot. Dad's entire face changed into something I had never seen before. Pure ice. After they hung up, he was silent for a full minute. Then he said, call my lawyer right now. Tell him it is an emergency. Lawyer arrived within an hour with a notary. Dad signed Everything with steady hands. And recorded a video with the lawyer's phone. My two oldest children just taught me something important, he said to the camera. They think visiting me before I die is a waste of their vacation days. So they won't get a single penny when I'm gone. Everything I spent 40 years destroying my body for will go to the two people who were here for me while I died. My nurse Nancy, held my hand through hell. And my youngest never left my side. He stared straight at the lens. I spent my whole life proving I loved you both. But you just proved you never loved me back. Congratulations. You're both orphans now. Later that night, dad died with Nancy and me beside him. The house went to me and his entire safe.

So I did exactly that and watched her world crumble. She watched me get down on one knee five times and said no every single time. Eight years together, I've been playing husband since year two, paying her car note, keeping her on my insurance, covering most of the rent while she found herself through three different careers. She had this whole routine down, tears in her eyes, hand on her heart. Then some perfectly rehearsed excuse, we're not ready. Let's wait till we're more stable. The timing isn't right. Then came proposal No. 5, and she finally showed me who she really was. I'd gone all out this time, convinced myself that maybe the problem was I hadn't made it special enough. I rented out her favourite restaurants, rooftop, hung string lights everywhere and invited all our friends and family there. The whole production cost me three months salary, but I thought it'd be worth it when she finally said yes. My girlfriend stood there in the dress I'd bought her, surrounded by everyone we knew, and she didn't even let me finish the speech. Just shook her head with this pitying smile like I was a dog that wouldn't stop bringing her the same stick. Back at our apartment that night, I finally broke, asked her straight up if she loved me. Why did she keep doing this? Her whole face changed in an instant and the mask came. Completely off. It's my choice when I accept a proposal, she said. Voice ice cold. You don't get to pressure me with your timeline. You're my boyfriend, so act like one. Stop trying to be my husband when I haven't even accepted your proposal. Know your place. Know my place. For eight years of building a life together, I was supposed to know my place. Those words rewired something in my brain. Eight years of playing husband while she kept me a boyfriend status because it was convenient for her. She wanted me to act like a boyfriend. Fine. I give her exactly what she asked for. But boyfriends don't pay their girlfriends bills. Boyfriends don't share bank accounts. Boyfriends don't sacrifice their futures for someone who won't even wear their ring. I started my new boyfriend only policy the next this morning while she was at her yoga class. First, I sold the ring to a dealer for 12 grand, enough to cover what I'd spent on her car this year alone. Then I called Verizon and removed her from my phone plan. The time she got home from yoga, I changed every password and moved my money from our joint account. She didn't even notice until lunch when her phone died mid phone call. Babe, my phone's not working, she texted from her laptop, annoyed but not worried. Call Verizon. It's being weird. An hour later, they said I'm not on the account anymore. Then the panic started. Creeping in. What did you do? I responded, I'm being your boyfriend and not.

My younger sister Ariana turned into a homewrecker the moment my husband Kevin slipped the ring on my finger and started a desperate pick me routine. If Kevin were blue, she'd show up in blue. If you mentioned liking something, she'd become an expert overnight. If he posted about a restaurant, she coincidentally appeared during our date. It started subtle, almost innocent. Even like sitting next to Kevin at every family dinner, Ariana would squeeze between us, claiming she couldn't hear from the other end. I didn't mind since family is family. But after six months, it got obvious. Kevin joined a gym near his office. Ariana got a membership there the next day, showing up during his workout times and tiny sports bras. Kevin mentioned liking astronomy once. Suddenly, Ariana was texting him NASA articles daily, asking, can you explain? Then came the fake emergencies. Her car broke down near Kevin's office. Her apartment had a gas leak when I was out of town. She needed help moving heavy boxes that turned out to be empty, Kevin always told me, immediately showing me her texts with eye rolls. She's just young and confused, he'd say. And I agreed until she officially went too far. A hard knock at 9:00am and there stood Ariana in a tiny white sundress, full makeup, hair curled like a magazine shoot. I need Kevin's Help moving furniture, she announced, pushing past me. Where is he? But we both knew she lived in a furnished apartment. I was about to tell her to leave when she added, I'm sure you have errands to run. You can go away now. She was literally trying to dismiss me from my own home. Kevin came downstairs and she immediately grabbed his arm. Oh, perfect. You're already dressed. I promise I'll return him in one piece. She actually winked at me. I felt my chest burn with rage, but then had a different thought. I headed upstairs, loudly saying, I need to take a bath. But I didn't leave or go to the bathroom. I stayed upstairs where I could hear everything through the vents. She didn't waste any time. Oh, my God, Kevin, you're so muscular, she giggled, clearly touching his arm. Do you work out every day? I bet you could lift me with one hand. Wanna try? I rolled my eyes. This girl had zero shame. I kept holding laundry, waiting for Kevin's polite deflection. Instead, I heard him say, seriously, Ariana, can I tell you something important? My heart sank. Oh, god, here we.

First thing, he'll try to make you laugh, even if it means making a fool of himself. Your smile is worth it. TikTok can reveal who secretly likes you. It's the second person that shows up when you click share. Then more. Boys will often find excuses to be around you, like asking for your help or accidentally bumping into you. 20 million people have the same birthday as you. Write yours in the comments to see who shares it. If he's always the first to view your stories or react to your posts, it's because he's keeping an eye on what you're up to. Most people's phone doesn't have this secret emoji. Just comment star in square brackets to unlock it. Boys might act more confident or try to impress you when they're around you. It's their way of catching your attention. If you wanna know more signs like this, follow now because you won't wanna miss what's next. When a guy likes you, he'll find ways to touch you, even if it's just a friendly pat on the back or a high five. If he remembers tiny details you've mentioned, like your favourite song or a story from months ago, he's definitely interested. Hit like if you've seen these signs before, and drop a comment if you think someone's been showing them to you. And here's the last one. Boys might tease or playfully annoy you, but it's just their way Of getting closer and seeing your reaction.

My high school made all the boys holding their pee because someone wrote hi on the wall in Sharpie. Monday morning we all showed up to find a sign taped to the boys bathroom door. Closed until further notice due to vandalism. The girls bathroom was still open, of course, but our school only had one bathroom for boys in the entire building because it was an old school built in the 60s when they apparently thought teenage boys never needed to pee. Principal Carpenter made an announcement during first period. Due to the disrespectful graffiti found in the boys restroom, this facility will remain locked until someone comes forward with information about who did it. The entire male population of our high school groaned at the same time. The crazy part was what the graffiti actually said. My friend Peyton had seen it Friday before they locked everything up. Someone had written HI in tiny letters on the bathroom stall. Not a curse word, not a drawing. Just HI I in black Sharpie about the size of a quarter. By lunch, the situation was getting desperate. Guys were asking teachers for hall passes to go to the nurse's office just to use that bathroom. But the school nurse caught on quick and started turning people away unless they were actually sick. Some guys tried using the staff bathroom, but got detention for that. A few desperate souls walked To the gas station across the street during lunch. But security started watching for that, too. We tried talking to Principal Carpenter. Reasonably. Group of five guys went to his office to explain that punishing 300 boys for one tiny word was insane. He sat behind his big desk with his arms crossed. Actions have consequences. When the vandal comes forward, everyone gets bathroom privileges back. By Wednesday, things were getting bad. Guys were dehydrated from not drinking water all day. The basketball team couldn't practice properly because half the players were holding it in. Parents started calling to complain. The carpenter wouldn't budge. He sent out an email saying this was a lesson in collective responsibility. That's when Dean Patterson had his brilliant idea. He was this quiet kid.

I paused, looked around, and said, I never got any money. The entire table went silent. You could hear the clinking of silverware from other tables, but at ours, dead quiet. My parents froze. My dad's fork literally clattered onto his plate, and my mom's hand started shaking as she reached for her wine glass. What do you mean you never got any money? Grandma asked, her voice getting that sharp edge I remembered from when she caught my cousins lying as kids. My mom cleared her throat nervously. Mother, we can explain this later. No! Grandma's voice cut through the air like a knife. Explain it now. I've been sending three thousand dollar checks to Monica every single month since Aubrey started college. Where is that money? My brain was spinning. Three thousand dollars a month for four years. I started doing the math in my head while everyone stared at me. That's when my little sister Savannah, who'd been scrolling through Instagram this whole time, suddenly looked up. Oh, wait. Is that where mom got the money for my BMW? If the table was quiet before, now it was like a tomb. Savannah, shut up! My mom hissed, but it was too late. And my spring break trip to Cancun last month, Savannah continued, completely oblivious to the horror spreading across everyone's faces. And that designer bag you bought me for Christmas. I felt like I was watching my life in slow motion. Four years. Four brutal years of working three jobs just to afford ramen noodles and textbooks. 60 hour work weeks while my parents took family vacations. Sleeping in a moldy basement apartment while my sister got a luxury car you stole from me. I said, my voice barely a whisper. My dad finally found his voice. Aubrey, Sweetheart, it's not what it looks like. Really? I stood up, my chair scraping against the floor. Because it looks like you watched me destroy my health. Working multiple jobs while you used my money to spoil Savannah. The restaurant felt like it was spinning. I remembered all those phone calls home, begging for help with textbooks, with rent, with groceries. All those times they said money was tight, they couldn't help. I needed to learn responsibility. How much? Grandma's voice was ice cold. I did the math out loud, my voice getting stronger with each. No. 3,000 * 12 months times four years. $144,000. My mom started crying. We were going to pay it back when you graduated. With what money? I laughed, but there was no humor in it. You don't have that kind of cash lying around. You spend it all on Savannah's lifestyle. Savannah finally looked up from her phone, realize. I think this was about her. Wait, so I have to give the car back? Are you serious? Right now. I turned to her. You're worried about keeping a car that was bought with stolen money while I've been eating peanut butter sandwiches for dinner? That's when Uncle Stewart would've been unusually quiet. Spoke up Monica

Oh, honey, let me tell you about the time my daughter didn't talk to me for two whole weeks because I betrayed her trust over a damn chicken nugget.

This girl acts like she's the CEO of the household, tells me things like, mom, please don't embarrass me in front of my friends. Just stand still and blink like, ma'am, you live in my uterus rent free for nine months. Show some respect. Anyway, she decides she's going vegan. Great. I support her. I buy tofu, almond milk, overpriced plant nuggets that taste like regret, the whole shebang. Do I understand it? No. But I'm a supportive queen. But then one night it's 1:00am, I'm watching reality TV in the dark and I get hungry. I open the freezer and see those dino shaped chicken nuggets she begged for last year and never ate. So I pop like 4 in the air fryer. I'm minding my business, living my best life life. And guess what? I forget to hide the evidence. Next morning she walks into the kitchen, sniffs the air like a bloodhound and goes, did you eat meat in this house? I said, um, maybe. She gasps like I just committed war crimes. You ate dead animals while I was sleeping. I said, baby girl, they were shaped like Dinosaurs, they're barely meat. Calm down. She grabs her reusable water bottle, slams it on the counter and yells, this is why the planet's dying, mom, because of people like you who can't control their midnight cravings. I said, okay, Greta Thunberg, relax. She storms off to her room and text me from down the hall. We're not speaking. This is a betrayal. I text back, fine, more dino nuggets from. She leaves me on read y'all. Two weeks she wouldn't speak to me, not even when I stubbed my toe and screamed so loud the neighbors checked on me. She just walked past me with her Hydro flask and judgmental aura. But then get this, one day I come home early from work. I walk into the kitchen and there she is standing in front of the microwave holding a plate with three dino nuggets. She's caught midbite. We lock eyes, time freezes. She goes, they don't count if they're Dinosaur shaped. I said, excuse me. She wipes her mouth like a criminal and goes, don't tell dad. I said, oh, I'm telling everyone. She bribes me with her leftover Starbucks gift card and begs for mercy. I post the photo in our family group chat. Anyway, catch then our little activist caught mid murder. Her grandpa replied, meet runs in the family. Her uncle sent a Dinosaur emoji. Now she talks to me again, but only if I swear never to bring it up again. And in front Of her friends. So what do I do? Oh, I bring it up at every chance, especially when they start talking about saving the turtles. Because if you're gonna give me the silent treatment over dino nuggets, you better be ready for extinction level consequences.

Mom stood 20 feet away pretending not to see. She perfected that skill over the years. That night, drunk on wine and self importance, he left me a voicemail. I almost deleted it immediately. Instead, something made me save it. His slurred words about how college would humble me, how I'd come crawling back begging for his approval, how I'd never amount to anything without his guidance. Stanford was everything he said it wouldn't be. I thrived, made Dean's list every semester. By junior year, I was already being recruited by investment firms. During spring break of my senior year, I found my stepfather in his study surrounded by real estate magazines and architectural plans. He was obsessing over the same Victorian mansion that had been for sale in our town's historic district for Three years asking price was $2.8 million, completely beyond his reach as a middle management insurance adjuster. Someday, he told mom as I passed by, when my promotion comes through, this house represents everything I've worked for. He drive past it every weekend, slowing down to stare at the wrap around porch and turret windows. It consumed him the way some people obsess over celebrities. After graduation, I moved to New York. Within two years, I was making more money than my stepfather would see in a decade. I bought a penthouse in Manhattan, built a life he said I'd never have. But I kept thinking about that house. Last month, the Victorian was back on the market. The price had dropped to $2.4 million. I flew home that weekend and toured it with a realtor. Crown molding, original hardwood floors, a library with built in shelves reaching the ceiling. I could see why my stepfather had dreamed about it. I made an all cash offer that afternoon. The closing was scheduled for a Thursday. I drove to my mother's house afterward, the deed still warm in my hands. My stepfather was in his usual spot on the recliner watching cable news and complaining about mortgage rates. Remember that Victorian you always wanted, I asked casually. His head snapped up. The Whitmore house, what about it? I bought it today. The color drained from his face. Mom stopped folding.

Last month, I took my girlfriend Ebony to get knee surgery after she tore her ACL playing soccer. My mom insisted on coming to the hospital because she wanted to support Ebony. Ebony goes into surgery and everything goes fine. When she wakes up in recovery, she's completely loopy from the anesthesia. The nurse warns us she might be a little confused and say some strange things. My mom immediately perks up. Oh, this should be interesting. Ebony opens her eyes and sees me first. Jake, you're so handsome, like a beautiful potato. Thanks, babe. How are you feeling? I feel like I'm floating. Am I floating? Are we in space? My mom laughs. No, sweetie, you're in the hospital. Ebony turns to look at my mom and her eyes go wide. Oh, my God. It's Jake's mom. You're so pretty. You look like Jake but with better hair. My mom is eating this up. Thank you, Ebony. I have something really important to tell you, Ebony says. Seriously? What's that, honey? Ebony motions for my mom to come closer. Come here. I need to whisper something in your ear. My mom leans in, expecting some sweet anesthesia confession. Ebony cups her hands around my mom's ear like she's about to share a deep secret. And then, but it's not just any burp. It's the loudest, longest, most obnoxious burp I've ever heard. And somehow in the middle of This massive belch, Ebony manages to say, I hate you. So what my mom hears directly in her ear is burp. I hate you. My mom jumps back like she's been attacked. What? Ebony starts giggling hysterically. I got you. I got you. So good. Ebony. Did you just burp I hate you in my ear? Maybe. Did it work? I'm trying not to laugh because my mom looks horrified. Ebony, that's my mom. I know she's great. I love her. That's why I gave her my special burp. My mom is still processing. Your special burp? Yeah, it's how I show affection. Jake gets them all the time. That's that's how you show affection. Ebony nods enthusiastically. The louder the burp, the more I love you. And that was a really loud burp. My mom looks at me. Jake, is this true? I'm bright red. Ebony has a very a unique way of expressing herself. Ebony interrupts Mrs. Simon. Wanna hear my impression of a dying whale? Ebony? No, but Ebony is already making horrible groaning sounds. Oh, the nurse comes running in. Is everything okay? Ebony waves at her. Hi, I'm practicing whale sounds. Ebony starts making clicking sound. Click, click, click. I'm talking to dolphins, my mom whispers to me. Is she always like this? Only when she's heavily medicated. Ebony overhears Mrs. Simon. Did Jake tell you about the time I accidentally called his dad daddy at dinner? Ebony, what? It was funny. Your dad turned So red, my mom is trying not to laugh. You called my husband daddy. Yeah. And then I asked him if he wanted to adopt me. Ebony, can we not tell my mom every embarrassing story right now? But I have so many good ones. Like time you cried watching The Notebook. Everyone cries watching The Notebook. You cried for two hours and then you made me watch it again. My mom is definitely laughing now. Jake cried for two hours. Ebony nod. And he ate an entire pint of ice cream with his hands. His hands. He said spoons were too slow for his emotional needs. I want to disappear. Ebony, you're supposed to be resting. I am resting. I'm resting my mouth by talking. The nurse checks Ebony's vitals. How are you feeling? I feel great. I just burped in Jake's mom's ear and told her I hate her, but I really love her. The nurse looks confused. You burped what? Ebony demonstrates by making another loud burping sound like that, but with words inside. My mom shakes her head. I've never experienced anything like that. Missus Simon, want me to teach you? Ebony, please don't teach my mom how to burp words. Why not? You never know when you might need to burp. Communicate. Ebony turns back to my mom. Missus Simon, I have another secret to tell you. My mom hesitates. Are you going to burp in my ear again? No. This is a real secret. Come closer. My mom cautiously leans in. Ebony whispered, I'm going to marry your son. My mom's face lights up. Really? Yeah. But don't tell him I'm going to propose to him, Ebony. That's not how proposals usually work. Why not? I'm a modern woman. I can post my potato boyfriend. Potato boyfriend. Ebony looks at me lovingly. Yeah, he's my beautiful potato. My mom is crying from laughing. Ebony, you're delightful. Thank you. That's why I gave you my best burp. The anesthesia starts wearing off and Ebony gets sleepy. Mrs. Simon, will you visit me when I'm not high on drugs? Of course, sweetie. Good. Next time I'll teach you my burping alphabet.

It's pathetic. So I put a stop to our fake marriage. We've been married for five years and I thought I was being the perfect husband. I spent three hours cooking her favorite meal for our anniversary, set up candles, even dug out that playlist from our first date. When she walked through the door with her sister and best friend, she took one look at the setup, rolled her eyes and said loud enough for everyone to hear, stop trying to be romantic. It's pathetic. You look desperate. Then she turned to her friends. This is exactly what I was telling you about. He does this needy stuff constantly. The room went dead silent. Her sister looked uncomfortable. Her best friend stared at the floor. I stood there holding wine, watching my wife destroy our marriage with one sentence. I set the wine down, looked her straight in the eye and said, you know what, you're absolutely right. She expected me to apologize, to scramble. Instead, I started blowing out the candles. What are you doing? She asked, losing that confident edge. Stopping, I replied, gathering the flowers. Romance is pathetic when it's one sided. So I'm done being pathetic. I tossed the flowers in the trash and ordered pizza. We can eat like roommates from now on, pepperoni or cheese. That night she tried damage control, talking about bad days, overreacting. But something had shifted in me. I heard you. Perfectly, I told her. Message received. No more romantic gestures, no more pathetic behavior. She laughed it off. Maybe we both need to be more realistic about what marriage actually is. Those words would haunt her the next morning. I didn't bring her coffee in bed like I had every weekend for five years. When she came downstairs expecting her usual cup, I was finishing mine. Coffee's in the kitchen, I said. Without looking, I saw our marriage clearly for the first time. I was the one planning date nights she'd complain about. I was the one remembering anniversaries. I was the one keeping romance alive. When I stopped being romantic, I stopped with everything unnecessary. No more good morning kisses, no more asking about her day. No more caring where she went. By day 10, the cracks show. Are you going to ask me about my presentation? She said, clearly fishing. Do you want to tell me about it? Well, it went well, she said, waiting for follow up questions that never came. Good for you. I went back to my phone. She stood there for a full minute waiting for me to engage. When it became clear I wasn't playing that role anymore, she left without another word. Three weeks in, she was losing her mind. She mentioned male co workers talk about her ex reaching out, brought up how attentive other husbands were. Each comment was fishing for jealousy. Any sign I still cared. My response was Always. That's interesting. Then I'd return to whatever I was doing. I'd started hitting the gym, reading books, learn in guitar, something she'd always dismissed as a waste of time. One month in, she cracked. She was waiting at the kitchen table when I got home. Papers spread everywhere. We need to talk. You're punishing me because your feelings got hurt. My feelings got hurt. I repeated, you humiliated me in front of your friends. Called five years of romantic gesture.

Like, who decided that was enough? Two days? That's not a break, that's a prank. Like, I touch my bed on Friday, and the next thing I know, the alarms ringing and it's Monday morning. And honestly, who even invented the seven day week? Like, what if there's actually supposed to be 10 or 18 days and we all just got scammed? And why is the ratio five days of pain to two days of peace? That's like ordering a pizza and only getting two slices. Because here's the thing. The weekend is not even a real weekend. Friday night is gone in a blink, Saturday doesn't even exist. It's more like catch up on chores day, and Sunday is finish all the homework you got day. Like, why do we even get homework? Is the weekend not supposed to be the week's end? Am I not supposed to rest? Meanwhile, school takes five whole days. Five. Imagine working five shifts at a job you never applied for. And the pay. See you again on Monday. Like, bro, at least jobs give you money. School gives you stress, exams, annoying teachers, and fire drills at 8:00am when it's freezing outside. Honestly, I wish we could flip it. Two days of school, five days of weekend. That's balance. That's peace. Until then, I'll be sitting in class every Monday wondering if dropping out is a spiritual call. No.

I painted it. I was standing in front of my largest piece at the gallery opening, champagne in hand, when a man in an expensive suit approached and started explaining my own painting to me. He had no idea I was the artist because the placard said Riley Turner, who he clearly assumed was a man since he kept talking about his brilliant technique. This guy Robert looked me up and down and said, you seem young to be at an opening like this. Let me guess, looking for a rich boyfriend? Smart girl. Lots of wealthy men here. He gestured at my painting like he owned it. See, what Riley is doing here requires years of training to appreciate. You probably just think the colors are pretty. The average woman just sees decoration. I took a sip of champagne and said, interest in perspective, which I guess he took as encouragement. Robert moved closer to the painting, physically stepping in front of me, and continued his lecture. A Girl Like You probably thinks this is just nice to look at, but there's actual intelligence behind it. The artist is obviously a man because women simply don't have this kind of technical mastery. Female painters do. Flowers and feelings. This has real intellectual depth. It's biological, really. Men are just more capable of this level of abstraction. When I mentioned I was Familiar with the artist's work. Robert laughed and patted my shoulder. Following him on Instagram to look at the pretty pictures doesn't count as being familiar with art, sweetheart. You probably think you're cultured because you went to that Van Gogh light show. Real knowledge comes from decades of study, not whatever you Learned from TikTok. Robert decided to test me. Rapid firing questions. Who's Basquiat? What's Kiara Scuro? Name three Renaissance painters besides Da Vinci. When I started to answer, he cut me off. Wrong. See this? This is why galleries shouldn't have open events. You probably googled some terms before coming here to impress men, but Riley here is working in a tradition you couldn't possibly understand without a proper education. Not community college, sweetie. Real universities. He returned to my painting, now explaining it louder to draw a crowd. What Riley has achieved here would cost probably 100,000 in education to even the materials alone cost more than you'd make in a month at whatever retail job you have. He looked at my outfit with disgust. Target clearance rack, right? Someone who shops there couldn't possibly grasp the investment in this piece. He probably spent more on one brush than your entire outfit. When I suggested the artist might be self taught, Robert sneered at me. Is that how you Learned about art? Painting parties? Robert grabbed my wrist, only to another angle, his grip too tight. You're too stupid to even stand in the right spot. Riley intended for this to be viewed from exactly here. Your ignorance is actually disrespectful to his work. He kept his hand on my wrist while explaining, though. Honestly, explaining this to you is like teaching calculus to a toddler. You lack the basic foundation to understand any of it. He noticed me trying to pull away and

My mom thought men were the cause of all evil. Ever since dad left us when I was 7. But that was years ago now. At 13, I had to wear this hideous shirt to school that said no boyfriends in three pink letters. She installed tracking apps, called during every free period, and even put a ring camera pointing at my bedroom window. But a small part of me understood why she was such a helicopter parent. We lived in a sketchy neighborhood. The first time I got cat called was on my eighth birthday. I was wearing a tutu skirt and with no man walking with us to protect us. We both got harassed by men all the time. So I could kind of see why she hated the male species so much. But here's the thing. All her rules didn't stop the harassment. They just made me an easier target. A girl walking alone, obviously without a boyfriend, practically wearing a sign that said vulnerable. That's when I met him. This guy from my chemistry class who noticed me speed walking past the bad corner one day, keys between my fingers, like mom taught me. Hey! He called out, you okay? I kept walking. Stranger danger and all that, but he persisted. I lived two blocks over. We could walk together. Mom's voice echoed in my head. That's how it starts. So I said no, practically ran away. But I noticed Him after that? Always seemed to be around when I was walking home. This went on for weeks. Until the day everything changed. One day, three guys started following me. My heart hammered as I fumbled for my phone. Then chemistry boy appeared. Just walked right up and put his arm around me. Hey, babe. Sorry I'm late. The guys backed off. Immediately. After they left, he dropped his arm. You good? When I nodded, he said something that made my skin prickle. I don't like you walking alone. Sweet or possessive? I couldn't tell. But either way, I was more scared of those three guys than him. So when he offered again, I finally said yes. Walks became a secret thing. Chemistry boy knew my whole schedule. Always texted home safe if he couldn't walk with me. Started teaching me self defense moves in the park. His hands adjusting my stance, showing me how to break a grip. Every girl should know this stuff, he said. But Mom's words never left my mind. Predators like to establish control. He'd appear at weird times. Just happened to be in the area. Sure. Once I joked about him following me, and his face went serious. I noticed things like that car that's been parked outside your house. I could have run then. Instead, I kept meeting him. Mom almost caught us once. I was in the middle of showing him where I lived. But I know when my mom's car turned The corner early. He practically dove behind a dumpster. My heart pounded as mom pulled up. Who are you talking to? Nobody. Just on the phone. I thought I was being so clever, sneaking around her rules. Turns out someone else was sneaking around, too, because a few days later, our neighbor, Mrs. Doyle, got robbed in broad daylight by someone who knew exactly when she'd be alone. The cop said mom went nuclear. It's always someone they trusted, someone who Learned their routine. She stared at me hard. You haven't been talking to any boys, right? I lied through my teeth while my phone buzzed. Another home safe text. Mystery Boy texted a lot. Like, a lot. Always asking where I was, who I was with. Once I didn't respond for an hour, and he showed up at the library looking panicked. Just worried, he said. Well, three weeks and two more neighborhood break ins later, I decided having him around was better than being alone. On days when my mom worked later, he'd sit in my closet doing homework while I kept watch. This is insane. Yeah, no kidding. Everything came crashing down on a Thursday. Mom came home early with a migraine. I barely got him in the closet before she walked in. Just gonna lie down, she said, heading to her room. He was trapped. My phone lit up with his text.

How has it gone for you? When my wife Rachel and I adopted Devon at six years old, they told us she had mild trust issues. What they didn't tell us was that she'd been returned by three families already. Devon showed up at our house with one tiny suitcase and a backpack that first night. I watched her through the doorway as she carefully laid out all her clothes on the bed. She folded each piece perfectly, put it back in the suitcase, and zipped it up. Then she slept on top of the covers, fully dressed. I thought maybe she was just nervous, but weeks went by, and that suitcase never got unpacked. We take out one outfit each morning, wear it all day, then fold it back up at night. Her closet stayed completely empty. Rachel tried everything. New sheets with unicorns on them, a night light shaped like a butterfly. We even let her pick out paint for her room walls. He chose white. Just plain white like before. One morning, I found her in the kitchen at 5 a m. Making her own breakfast. Toast with no butter. Just dry bread. When I asked why she was up so early, she said, I didn't want to bother you guys. Sometimes people get mad when kids wake them up. That broke my heart. Rachel and I had been trying for years to have kids. We dreamed About Saturday morning pancakes and bedtime stories. But Devin acted like she was living in a hotel, not a home. The real wake up call came three months later. I got home from work and heard crying upstairs. I found Devon sitting on her bed, holding that stupid suitcase in her lap. What's wrong, sweetheart? She looked up at me with these huge brown eyes and said, I heard you and Rachel fighting last night about money. I know kids cost a lot. I can go back to Miss Janet tomorrow if you want. Miss Janet was her social worker. My throat got tight. Rachel and I had been arguing about our car payment. Nothing to do with Devon at all. Devon, we weren't fighting about you. We love having you here. She just shrugged. That's what the Johnson said, too. And the Millers. They all said I was special. Until I wasn't anymore. That night, Rachel and I sat up talking until 3 a m. We realized Devon wasn't just scared of us leaving her. She was waiting for us to leave her. She'd been through this routine before. Nice family, happy faces. Then back to foster care. When things got tough the next day, I had an idea. I went to the hardware store and bought the biggest picture frame they had, like three feet wide. Then Rachel and I spent the whole weekend taking photos. Devon at breakfast, Devon watching TV, Devon playing with our dog, Charlie. Just normal, boring family stuff. We printed out all the pictures and arranged them in the frame. Beach trips we took her on. Movie nights on the couch. Devon's first day at her new school. Even the bad pictures where someone was making a weird face. When Devon got home from school Monday, we called her into the living room.

It's 7:00am. I'm still half asleep with coffee when my daughter bust into the bathroom like the FBI. She's holding her underwear up like a bloody flag and screaming, mom, I'm leaking from the wrong end! I'm gonna die! I nearly spit coffee everywhere. I say, sweetheart, calm down. That's just your period. She freezes, squints at me and yells, you liar! I knew you made that story up few months ago. I actually explained this whole thing Saturday down. Gave her the talk, showed her pictures. She rolled her eyes and said, nice prank, mom. You really think I'm that dumb? Now she's standing here like I faked the whole biology system just to mess with her. She stomps her foot. So you mean to tell me women eat every month and just go to target like nothing happened? She's pacing, yelling, you could have stopped this! You're my mom, not my enemy! I hand her a pad. She picks it up with two fingers like it's radioactive. This is a diaper. You want me to wear a diaper to school? Kids already bully me for my Lunchables. If I sound like a Doritos bag when I walk, I'm done. She sticks it on, takes two steps. Crunch, crunch! She stops, dead serious. Perfect. Now I'm Miss Fritos. Then she whispers, wait, does dad get this, too? I almost choked on my coffee. No, baby, only girls! She screams. Figures. Men don't do anything. They just fart and watch football while we bleed like stabbed pumpkins. She comes home from school later, furious. Mom, you didn't warn me the pad sticks to your leg hair. I was in that stall fighting for my life. People thought I was wrestling a raccoon. Then she adds, and when I sneezed in math, I thought my kidney fell out. Thanks, mom. Now they call me Leaky Lindsay. That night, she's on the couch, blanket eating pad, hot Cheetos in her lap, looking like a soldier who saw combat. She points at her brother and yells, enjoy your balls, loser! My. This is literally trying to kill me. He cried into his Pop Tarts. Next morning, she tries to get out of chores. Mom, I can't clean. My uterus is in critical condition. I say, nope. She glares at me, wow, you're a woman, too? And you still betrayed me. You're basically a war criminal. At dinner, my husband's carving chicken. It's calm. Suddenly, she stands up, bangs her glass with a fork, and goes, ladies and gentlemen, I am now a woman. My uterus has joined the group chat. Please clap. My husband choked on a drumstick. My son screamed, gross! And ran upstairs. And the grand finale. She whips out a Sharpie, lifts her shirt, and across her stomach she's written in giant letters, congrats, dad! You're next! I nearly passed out laughing. My husband dropped his fork like he saw a Ghost! My son slammed his door, and my daughter, she just sat back down, grabbed mashed potatoes with her hands, and goes. Period season has officially started, bitches.

My mom thought men were the cause of all evil. Ever since dad left us when I was 7. But that was years ago now. At 13, I had to wear this hideous shirt to school that said no boyfriends in three pink letters. She installed tracking apps, called during every free period, and even put a ring camera pointing at my bedroom window. But a small part of me understood why she was such a helicopter parent. We lived in a sketchy neighborhood. The first time I got cat called was on my eighth birthday. I was wearing a tutu skirt and with no man walking with us to protect us. We both got harassed by men all the time. So I could kind of see why she hated the male species so much. But here's the thing. All her rules didn't stop the harassment. They just made me an easier target. A girl walking alone, obviously without a boyfriend, practically wearing a sign that said vulnerable. That's when I met him. This guy from my chemistry class who noticed me speed walking past the bad corner one day, keys between my fingers, like mom taught me. Hey! He called out, you okay? I kept walking. Stranger danger and all that, but he persisted. I lived two blocks over. We could walk together. Mom's voice echoed in my head. That's how it starts. So I said no, practically ran away. But I noticed Him after that? Always seemed to be around when I was walking home. This went on for weeks. Until the day everything changed. One day, three guys started following me. My heart hammered as I fumbled for my phone. Then chemistry boy appeared. Just walked right up and put his arm around me. Hey, babe. Sorry I'm late. The guys backed off. Immediately. After they left, he dropped his arm. You good? When I nodded, he said something that made my skin prickle. I don't like you walking alone. Sweet or possessive? I couldn't tell. But either way, I was more scared of those three guys than him. So when he offered again, I finally said yes. Walks became a secret thing. Chemistry boy knew my whole schedule. Always texted home safe if he couldn't walk with me. Started teaching me self defense moves in the park. His hands adjusting my stance, showing me how to break a grip. Every girl should know this stuff, he said. But Mom's words never left my mind. Predators like to establish control. He'd appear at weird times. Just happened to be in the area. Sure. Once I joked about him following me, and his face went serious. I noticed things like that car that's been parked outside your house. I could have run then. Instead, I kept meeting him. Mom almost caught us once. I was in the middle of showing him where I lived. But I know when my mom's car turned The corner early. He practically dove behind a dumpster. My heart pounded as mom pulled up. Who are you talking to? Nobody. Just on the phone. I thought I was being so clever, sneaking around her rules. Turns out someone else was sneaking around, too, because a few days later, our neighbor, Mrs. Doyle, got robbed in broad daylight by someone who knew exactly when she'd be alone. The cop said mom went nuclear. It's always someone they trusted, someone who Learned their routine. She stared at me hard. You haven't been talking to any boys, right? I lied through my teeth while my phone buzzed. Another home safe text. Mystery Boy texted a lot. Like, a lot. Always asking where I was, who I was with. Once I didn't respond for an hour, and he showed up at the library looking panicked. Just worried, he said. Well, three weeks and two more neighborhood break ins later, I decided having him around was better than being alone. On days when my mom worked later, he'd sit in my closet doing homework while I kept watch. This is insane. Yeah, no kidding. Everything came crashing down on a Thursday. Mom came home early with a migraine. I barely got him in the closet before she walked in. Just gonna lie down, she said, heading to her room. He was trapped. My phone lit up with his text. Still in here? No sheet, Sherlock. That's when I heard it. Glass breaking downstairs. My whole body went ice cold. Mom appeared in my doorway, face white. Did you hear that? We froze as footsteps creaked on the stairs. Heavy, deliberate. Mom's eyes went wide. She mouth 9 1 1, but her phone was downstairs in her purse. Mine was dead. The foot steps got closer. My 4:11. Mom pushed me behind her, grabbing my field hockey stick. The door swung open. A man in a ski mask stood there, knife glinting. Mom swung the stick, but he caught it, yanked it away, shoved her heart into the wall. I screamed. The closet door exploded open. Chemistry boy launched himself at the intruder using those same moves he taught me. They crashed into the hallway. Call 9 1 1! He yelled.

It started when my sister Chloe came home crying because her boyfriend Jake dumped her. She's 25 and I'm 17, but she always acts like she's the victim in every situation. This time was different, though. She kept saying Jake was horrible and cruel. But when I asked what happened, she got all shifty. He said he broke up with her out of nowhere and kicked her out of his apartment. But then she mentioned she still had keys to his place because she forgot to give them back. The next day, she left early in the morning and came back with this huge golden retriever. I recognized him immediately. It was Buster, Jake's dog. Love that dog more than anything. When his grandpa died last year, Buster was the only thing that helped him through it. I asked Chloe why she had Buster, and she got this weird smile on her face. She said Jake didn't deserve to keep him since he broke her heart. Then she said something that made my stomach drop. She told me she was going to take Buster to the vet tomorrow to put him down as payback for what Jake did to her. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This dog was completely healthy and happy, just confused about being in a new place. Buster kept looking around for Jake and whining by the door. It was heartbreaking. I Told Chloe she was being insane and she couldn't just kill someone's dog because she was upset. She laughed and said Jake should have thought about that before he decided to hurt her. Then she said if I told anyone, she'd make sure I regretted it. That night I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about Buster and how scared he must be. Around 2:00am, I heard Chloe on the phone with someone, probably making the vet appointment. I knew I had to do something. Then next morning, Chloe left for work and told mom she was taking Buster for a walk later. Mom didn't know the whole story. Chloe just said Jake asked her to watch his dog for a few days. As soon as both then were gone, I called Jake. He picked up on the first ring and sounded terrible. I told him Chloe had Buster and was planning to put him down today. He went completely silent for like 10 seconds, then started freaking out. He said he'd been looking everywhere for Buster and thought maybe he got out somehow. I told Jake to come over now while Chloe was at work. He was at our house in 15 minutes. When he saw Buster, he literally started crying. Buster went crazy with excitement, jumping all over him and licking his face. I opened the door and Jake carried his dog out to his car. Before he left, Jake told me what really happened with Chloe. She didn't Just get dumped. She cheated on him with his best friend, Marcus. When Jake found out, he broke up with her and told her to move out. She stole Buster on her way out and left Jake's spare key on the counter so he thought she was being mature about the breakup. A few hours later, Chloe came home and went straight to look for Buster. When she couldn't find him, she started screaming my name. She found me in my room and absolutely lost it. She called me a traitor and said I had no right to interfere in her business. Then mom came home and asked what all the yelling was about. Chloe told her I let some guy steal her dog. She made it sound like I just gave away her pet to a random stranger. Mom looked

My 6 year old nephew absolutely destroyed my sister at Thanksgiving dinner. And honestly, she deserved it. My sister Emma has always been obsessed with appearances, perfect makeup, designer clothes, constantly taking selfies. She's the type who spends two hours getting ready just to go to target. At family dinners, she'd always make these passive aggressive comments about everyone else's life choices. So we're all sitting around the table Last Thanksgiving. Emma shows up an hour late because she had to get her nails done. She's wearing this ridiculous white dress to a family dinner where we're eating gravy and cranberry sauce. Classic Emma move. She immediately starts her usual routine, comments about how Mom's stuffing has too much salt this year, mentions how Uncle Rick should probably lay off the dinner rolls, makes this big show of only eating tiny portions because she's watching her figure. Then she turns to my brother Jake, who just started community college. So Jake, still taking those little classes. When are you going to get a real degree? Jake just stared at his plate. The kids working two jobs to pay for school. Emma kept going. She asked my cousin about her starter apartment and wondered when she'd get a grown up job. She even made a comment about dad's old truck in the driveway saying it was embarrassing. The whole time my nephew Tyler was just sitting there eating his Turkey. And watching Tyler's, Jake's 6 year old son, super quiet kid, usually just plays with his food and doesn't say much during adult conversations. Emma was on a roll. She started talking about her new boyfriend's BMW and how they're looking at condos downtown, really laying it on thick about how successful she is compared to everyone else. Then she made her biggest mistake. She looked at Tyler and said, Tyler, sweetie, make sure you study hard in school so you don't end up like your daddy. Okay? The table went dead silent. Jake's face turned red. Mom literally gasped. Dad put down his fork and just stared at Emma. But Tyler. Tyler just looked up from his mashed potatoes, blinked those big innocent eyes and said in the sweetest voice ever, Aunt Emma, why?

He just shrugs and says, I'm not really hungry. Oh, ask about you. But then when he finally picks up on the hint, instead of having his mom make us a snack, he just leans toward the kitchen and yells, mom dog is hungry. Can you make him something? Like, bro, oh, why would you say it like that? Now she either thinks my parents don't feed me at home or I'm a big back here to clear out her fridge. Yeah, do I secretly want to inhale all the food in their house? Yes, but that's beside the point. Subscribe.

But here's the problem scrolling through hashtags at 2:00am is not the same thing as a professional evaluation. Google is not your therapist. ID Labs tests are not your psychiatrist. And that one influencer who talks about their symptoms in a story time? Definitely not a doctor.

Then D4D has a whole body in his car, like not a metaphorical one, an actual human body in a bag in his trunk. And this dude just casually performed like he didn't have a horror movie in his backseat. What the hell? And even outside all of that, Elon Musk is no longer the richest person in the world, losing his top spot to a rival tech CEO, showing how unstable everything feels right now, even at the highest levels. It's like every time I open my phone, reality speed runs. Another tragedy. Like, bro, it's been 11 days. September just started. I thought my only problem this month would be math class, but no, apparently it's Full blown world collapse. Society isn't just cooked, it's burnt to ash. Wakati Huo.

If you whispered there during lunch, it would amplify and carry across the entire room like a ghost voice. I discovered this by accident when I was hiding back there, eating alone, complaining under my breath about Mister Rodriguez's impossible math test. Suddenly, half the cafeteria turned around looking confused. That's when the idea hit me. I started small, whispering random stuff during lunch to test the range. Someone left their car lights on or free pizza in the gym, just enough to watch heads turn and people look around confused. The acoustics were perfect. My voice would bounce off the loose tiles, get amplified by the weird ceiling cavity, then float across the room like some supernatural announce. It sounded nothing like my normal voice, more like a distant radio transmission or a voice from another dimension. But then I overheard the drama that would change everything. Jessica Chen was bragging to her friends about how she'd been anonymously reporting kids to administration for vaping. I've gotten like 12 people suspended, he laughed. They have no idea it's me. I just sent anonymous tips to Principal Walsh's email. She was proud of it, genuinely proud of ruining people's lives for a few extra points on her college applications. Perfect. Target acquired. The next day during lunch, I positioned myself in the Echo corner. I Waited until Jessica was surrounded by her usual crowd, then whispered just loud enough. Jessica Chen is the vaping snitch, the whisper.

I gotta say this because it's been sitting on my chest. Nobody, and I mean nobody, should be celebrating Charlie Kirk's death. And before anybody gets mad at me, hear me out. I don't care if you hated what he stood for. I don't care if you never agreed with a single thing that came out of his mouth. There's a difference between disagreeing with someone and actually cheering when they're gone. Like, do you realize how weird that is? A man just lost his life, and the first instinct some people have is to make jokes, memes, clap, emojis, little he deserved it comments, bro. That's not activism. That's not standing for what you believe in. That's just heartless. And let's not forget, behind all the politics, behind all the headlines, there's a real family sitting there grieving. There's a wife who just lost her husband. There's kids who just lost their dad. Imagine being them, scrolling online and seeing people laugh about it. That doesn't make you powerful. It doesn't make you woke. It makes you cold. Here's the bigger picture. When you start normalizing this energy, when you start clapping every time somebody you don't like goes down, you're not actually winning anything. You're just feeding into the same negativity you claim to be against. You're lowering the bar of empathy until there's nothing left. And what happens then? Everyone's just waiting for the next tragedy to entertain them. That's not society. That's just chaos. You can hate his views, you can call out his words, you can spend your whole life disagreeing with the man. That's fine. That's human. But death is bigger than politics. Death is bigger than arguments. And if we really want the world to be a better place, maybe it starts with not cheering when someone's gone. So, yeah, nobody should be celebrating Charlie Kirk's death. You don't gotta like him, but at least respect life. Because if you lose that, if you can't even respect the finality of death, then, honestly, what does that say about you?

When I tried to correct my stepdaughter, I just smiled and said, alright. I'm Brandon, 38 and married to Samantha for three years. She has twin 12 year olds from her first marriage, Charlotte and Aiden. Their dad sends birthday cards twice a year if we're lucky. Last Tuesday, I caught Charlotte stealing 20 bucks from Samantha's purse. When I confronted her, she rolled her eyes and said, you're not my real dad. You can't tell me what to do. I calmly told Samantha what happened. Instead of addressing the theft, she got defensive. Don't lecture my kids about money. If you want a parent so badly, get your own children. That's dumb. But I just smiled and said, alright. See, what Samantha didn't know was that I've been covering their car insurance, phone bills and school supplies for months. While she struggled with debt, I'd also been quietly setting aside college funds for both kids, $400 a month each in the savings accounts they didn't even know existed. The next morning, I canceled everything. Car insurance, gone. Phone plan, terminated. The college accounts I'd open, closed and transferred to my personal savings. I also stopped buying groceries. No more weekly 200 dollar trips to keep the pantry stocked. No more paying for their Netflix, Spotify or Charlotte's dance classes that cost me $150 a month. Aiden soccer registration fees, not my problem anymore. I even canceled the family gym. Membership and stopped paying for their school lunches. Every subscription, every monthly payment, every little expense I've been quietly handling, all of it gone. When Charlotte's phone got shut off at school and she couldn't call her friends, she came home furious. Why isn't my phone working? Ask your mom, I said, not looking up from my laptop. Aiden couldn't get picked up from soccer practice because the car insurance had lapsed and Samantha's registration was expired. She had to leave work early, costing her overtime pay she desperately needed. That evening, Samantha panicked when she opened the fridge to find it nearly empty. The pantry was bare except for some stale crackers and a can of beans. Where's all the food? What happened to everything? She demanded, hands shaking as she looked at the empty shelf.

Me and my older brother Nate were best friends growing up. He was everything I wanted to be, tough, protective, always getting me out of trouble. When I messed up, when I broke Mrs. Wilson's window playing baseball, Nate took the blame and got grounded for two weeks. When I failed my math test, spent hours helping me study for the retake. We shared everything, our tiny bedroom, video games, even a fake ID when we got to college, our parents died in a car crash when I was 15. The whole world felt like it was ending. But Nate stepped up immediately. He was only 22, barely an adult himself, but he became my legal guardian without hesitation. He dropped out of his senior year, got two jobs, working at a warehouse during the day and cleaning offices at night. I never heard him complain once. He'd come home exhausted, covered in sweat and dust, but still help me with homework. When other kids got allowances, Nate made sure I had lunch money. When I wanted new sneakers, he worked overtime to get them. He never made me feel like a burden, even though I knew I was draining every penny he earned. I graduated high school with decent grades and got into State College. Nate was so proud. He cried at my graduation, said our parents would have been proud, too. He kept working those same two jobs to pay my Tuition, living off ramen noodles and hope. I promised him someday I'd pay him back for everything. Four years later, I landed a good job at an accounting firm, finally making real money. First thing I did was try to give Nate cash, but he refused, said seeing me succeed was payment enough. That's just how he was, never wanted anything for himself. Last Thanksgiving, I brought my fiance, Emma, home to meet him. She'd heard all my stories about my amazing big brother who raised me. They got along great, laughing at old photos, Nate telling embarrassing stories about when I was little. Everything felt perfect. Later that night, after Emma went to bed, Nate asked me to sit down. He looked nervous, fidgeting with his coffee cup like he used to do when we were kids. And he had something serious to tell me.

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently and just her school clothes, no coat, tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out, he said. I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up feeling how ice cold her little body was and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key, Fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected, sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning. I told her actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's Pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I never seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me, nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter. Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever, but I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years, the man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me. He picked Up phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win, win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear, from rage. I pulled out my phone and speed dialed a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine. It's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed six months ago? File everything tonight. Jonathan's controller slipped from his hands. What are you doing? What you should have expected when you decided to mess with my.

We're done being your servants, mom announced, slapping a contract on the kitchen table I'd scrubbed an hour ago. This says that you will do exactly 50% of all household chores. Sign it. She started recording on her phone while dad stood behind her, arms crossed. We're exhausted from carrying you. The irony was incredible. I been doing way more than 50% of everything for two years. While they couldn't even tell you where we kept the laundry detergent. Mom hadn't cooked since 2022. Dad hadn't touched a vacuum in forever. Yet they genuinely believe they were doing most of the housework. 50% or find somewhere else to live, dad added, wearing the shirt I'd ironed that morning. I looked at the contract, then at their smug faces, then I signed it with a smile. You're absolutely right, 50% starting tomorrow. I promise I'll never do more than my exact share again. They actually high five each other like they'd just won a free slave in the lottery, realising their problems were about to skyrocket. The next morning, mom was on the phone with her sister at 6:00am, bragging about their breakthrough in parenting. We finally taught him responsibility, she gloated. Kids these days need firm boundaries, dad chimed in from the bathroom. Should have done this years ago. Watch how smooth everything runs now that he knows we mean business. They moved through their morning routine with the confidence of people who never had to think about clean clothes magically appearing in their closets or lunches mysteriously packing themselves. That's when I decided to follow exactly what the contract said. Twenty minutes later, I started the laundry and pulled my clothes out mid cycle, leaving the machine full of soapy water. Dad discovered his work shirts floating in cold gray water at 7:00am, his confident whistling dying mid note as he started screaming from the laundry room. He he missed his critical client meeting trying to dry a shirt with Mom's hair dryer still damp, patches visible during his afternoon presentation. Mom fared no better. She'd assumed her presentation outfit would be clean as always, only to find it buried under a week of their dirty clothes. She did her zoom presentation to corporate in a wrinkled gym shirt, her credibility evaporating as quickly as her promotion chances. By Wednesday, the house reeked, taking out exactly one trash bag, mine, leaving theirs to ferment in the summer heat. When Mom's book club arrived, I watched from my spotless half of the living room as her best friend's face contorted at the smell. We're doing exactly fifty. Fifty now, I explained cheerfully, showing them Mom's recorded contract. She was very insistent about fairness. The women exchanged glances before suddenly remembering other commitments. Mom's smile cracked like old paint. Real collapse came Friday when Dad's boss arrived for dinner. I'd vacuumed exactly Half of each room, leaving a perfect line down the middle like a bizarre art installation. The dining table was set only on my side, where I sat eating takeout while dad frantically tried to explain why half their home looked abandoned. Where's the food? Dad hissed in the kitchen. I only bought my half of groceries. Cooking for others would exceed my share, I called out loud enough for his boss to hear. The man left after 15 minutes muttering about family issues. When they realized they'd messed up, they attempted gaslighting me into going back to how things were. You're being deliberately difficult, mom accused during another family meeting. This isn't what we meant, and you know it. I pulled out my phone, playing back her video from the first meeting. You said, and I quote, exactly 50% of all household chores. No more free rides. I have spreadsheets showing I'm doing precisely 50%. Dad tried a different angle. You're supposed to be mature enough to understand what we really meant. Oh, so you meant I should read your minds instead of following the written contract you made me sign. They went silent, awkwardly avoiding my eyes. They couldn't exactly scold me about doing exactly what they wanted me to do, but their friends started joking about the 50% house. At social gatherings, they cracked. Please just go back to how things were before, mom begged. We didn't realize you were doing so much, dad nodded frantically. We'll Rip up the contract. Just please clean the bathroom properly. My boss is coming for dinner tomorrow. I leaned back in my chair, savoring the moment. Actually, I'm really enjoying this new system. It's given me so much more time for studying, and my grades have never been better. Plus, you were right, 50% is much fairer than what I was doing before. The panic in their eyes was palpable.

I was in Mr Aneta's history class when the announcement came over the intercom. Code Red. Code red. This is not a drill. Everyone froze. We practiced this 100 times. Lock the door. Turn off the lights. Hide in the corner. Mr Grenada immediately jumped up and reached for the door lock. Then Vice Principal Medina's voice boomed through the speaker. False alarm, everyone. Some pranksters called in a fake threat. Continue with your lessons. Do not lock your doors. I repeat, do not initiate lockdown procedures. Mr Grenada hesitated with his hand on the lock. My friend Maddie whispered from her desk. I said, Code Red, that's the real signal. Mr Aneta looked confused. The VP says it's fake, though. Then we heard it, footsteps running down the hallway, not walking, running hard and fast like someone was being chased. Mr Medina's voice came back on. Teachers, I said, continue teaching. Any classroom that locks their door will have their teacher written up for insubordination. Mr Arneta slowly backed away from the door. He looked scared but sat back at it desk. Everyone stay calm. Let's continue with the lesson. Sweat was dripping from his forehead and nobody could focus. The running footsteps kept happening, first on our floor, then above us and back again. pulled out my phone and opened our school's parent Facebook group. My mom had posted that police were surrounding the School. They told us someone called about a weapon. She spammed my phone saying she loves me. My hands started shaking. I showed Maddie the post. Her face went white. She raised her hand. Mr Aneta, my mom says the police are outside. Mr Aneta walked to the window and peeked through the blinds. He gasped loudly. There were six police cars in the parking lot. Mr Medina came on again. Students ignore any social media posts. This is a routine false alarm. Any student caught on their phone will receive immediate suspension. Any teacher who initiates lockdown will be terminated. I saw Mr Aneta's jaw clench. We could hear doors slamming somewhere in the building, not closing, slamming like someone was checking rooms. Then we heard something that made everyone freeze. The fire exit at the end of our hallway opened and slammed shut. Someone was on our floor. Maddie grabbed my arm so tight it hurt. The footsteps were getting closer, classroom by classroom. Mr Grenada stood up and walked toward the door again, but he stopped. He looked at us and at the door and back at us. The footsteps stopped right outside our room. That's when Pete, the quiet kid who never talked, stood up. He grabbed his desk and started dragging it toward the door. Mr Anetta, help me now. Mr Anetta snapped out of it. What are you doing? Pete didn't stop. My dad's a cop, he said. If we ever hear Code Red, We lock down no matter what anyone says, even the principal. The door knob started to turn. Everyone moved at once. Kids grabbed desks and chairs and shoved them against the door. Mr Anetta finally joined us. Lights, someone get the lights. Maddie hit the switch. We pushed everything we could find against that door. The person outside pushed hard. The door opened a crack, but hit our barricade. They put harder. Mr Medina's voice screamed through the intercom, which classroom is refusing to follow directions? You will all be expelled. But we didn't care about his threats anymore. The person outside kicked the door. The whole barricade shook. Some girls started crying. Pete pointed to the back.

Then TikTok picks a song for me and it's Adele's Someone Like You. I was like, wait, what? I literally just woke up, was feeling cute, and TikTok's out here making it seem like I'm going through a breakup or something. So of course I had to try again. This time I took a pic of my cat just sleeping, all peaceful and cozy. Guess what song TikTok gave me? Megan, thee Stallion. Savage. Now my cat's out here being a whole bad bitch. Like what's going on TikTok? My friend tried it too. She took a pic of her breakfast, some toast and eggs, all cute and simple, and TikTok gave her unholy. At this point I'm seriously wondering if this app has psychic powers. It's not just matching songs to photos, it's like reading right through your soul. Now every morning I'm like, okay, what moods TikTok gonna give me today? I snap a pic and wait for the app to tell me how I'm feeling with a song. Y'all gotta try this. Take any pic, let TikTok pick your vibe. Then Come back and tell me what song it gave you. Because honestly, I need to know if I'm the only one getting mind read by TikTok

I stared in shock. What basement? I'm giving birth at the hospital. Oh, honey, Agnes said, reaching across the table to pat my hand. women have been delivering babies at home for five generations. I delivered Brent and his sisters right here in this house. My husband Brent squeezed my shoulder. Mom's delivered over 20 babies for our family. She knows what she's doing. The baby kicked hard against my ribs like it was trying to escape this conversation. We've been living in Brent's childhood home while our house underwent renovations. Not once had anyone mentioned this family tradition. I already have an OB, I said, my voice shaking. We've been planning a hospital birth. I'm high risk because of my blood pressure. Agnes waved her hand dismissively. Hospitals are where people go to die. Your own mother died giving birth in one of those places. The words hit me like a physical blow.

This is how my family does things. I'm not giving birth in some basement room with your mother playing doctor. His face hardened in a way I've never seen before. If you can't respect our traditions, Then maybe this marriage was a mistake. I froze. You're threatening divorce because I want actual medical care. He showed me our prenup clause 15. In case of divorce due to irreconcilable differences about family values, you forfeit custody rights. My legs went weak. I sank onto the bed. I had no money of my own, no family since my father died last year. Without Brent, I'd lose everything, including my baby. The next weeks became a waking nightmare. Agnes started her preparations, which included drinking foul smelling teas and attending birthing circles with other women from their community. During one session, a woman named Carol pulled me aside. My sister died during one of Agnes's home births five years ago, she whispered. They said it was God's will, but she bled out while Agnes refused to call an ambulance. My blood turned to ice that night. I searched online for anything about the Mitchell family. Three women had died during home births in this county over the past 15 years. Agnes's name was never mentioned, but the address. This were all in this neighborhood. The headache started the following week. My vision blurred and my feet swelled so badly I couldn't wear shoes, classic signs of preclampsia. When I told Agnes, she gave me more herbs and said hospital monitoring would just stress them, baby. She took my phone the next day, said I was reading too many scary stories online. Brent agreed it was for the best. I Waited until Agnes left for her weekly grocery run and snuck to the neighbor's house. I called my old colleague who worked as a labor and delivery nurse. You need to get to a hospital now, she said, after I described my symptoms. You could have a stroke or seizure. The baby could die. I can't, I sobbed. I'll lose custody if I leave. You'll lose your life if you stay. That night at dinner, I showed Brent the information she had texted. For the first time, I saw doubt cross his face. Maybe we should just get you checked, he said quietly, just to be safe. Agnes slammed her hand on the table. Absolutely not. Doubt is what kills mothers and babies. Faith is what saves them. But Brent held firm. We'll go tomorrow morning just for a quick check up. I never made it to morning. The contraction started at 2:00am, five weeks early. Brent ran for his keys, but Agnes had already taken them. She locked the doors from the inside with keys only she had. This is meant to be, she said, only as I doubled over in pain. The baby knows when it's time. Brent pounded on the doors, tried to break windows, but Agnes had prepared for this. Security bars on everything. No phones, no landline in our room. She LED me to the basement where her birthing room waited. Ancient equipment that belonged in a museum, stained sheets, the smell of old blood. Poorly masked by incense. As the contractions intensified, I heard Agnes on an old rotary phone in the corner. Yes, the policy is.

I came home early and found my mom in bed with Mister. Lowell, my AP chemistry teacher who's married with three kids. I stood frozen in the doorway, feeling like I was about to vomit. Her blazer was draped over the lamp and his dress shirt lay inside out on the floor. The smell of his Cologne, the same one that made me gag in chemistry class, was now contaminating my mother's bedroom. Mr. Lowell ran past me, clutching his pants while his pale chest showed scratch marks, and my mother wrapped herself in a sheet with her face completely drained of color. Please let me explain, she said, with tears streaming down her face as she reached toward me with shaking hands. How could you? I screamed and backed into the hallway. He's my teacher. His wife goes to your book club. My mother sat on the bed and put her head in her hands while her whole body trembled. I had no choice. Everyone has a choice about who they sleep with, I said as my voice cracked. Mom said, Mr. Lowell has been selling pills to students at your school. My face dropped. What? Fentanyl, sweetheart? Xanax? Adderall. Three kids have overdosed this semester alone. I stared at her and tried to process this. So you decided to have an affair with him? How does that make any sense? Even If he was, why wouldn't you just call the police? My mother stood on unsteady legs and walked to her closet. She pulled out a box from the top shelf with trembling hands. Inside were photos, recording devices, and documents with FBI letterhead. My blood went cold when I looked at surveillance photos of my chemistry teacher in dark parking lots. Mister Lowell isn't just some teacher selling pills on the side, she said while her voice broke. He's part of a major operation. They're using teachers in five districts because no one suspects educators. She sat back down and looked older than I'd ever seen her. The FBI recruited me six months ago because I had access to him through school events. Just supposed to gather information at PTA meetings. But he wouldn't talk business unless we got closer. Tears were running down her face now. One of the kids who overdosed died last month. You remember? He was 14 years old. His little sister found his body. I remembered his memorial, where his parents sobbed uncontrollably. His little sister had to be carried out of the auditorium while the rest of us wore purple ribbons. Does dad know? I whispered. No one knows except my handler. She looked destroyed. Not even your father knows. Because if anyone knew, the whole operation would collapse. We spread photos across the bed showing Mister Local meeting teachers in parking garages. Text messages using code words were visible alongside a spreadsheet of Student names with prices that made me sick. These were kids I knew and sat next to in class. They target specific students, he said while showing me their notes. Kids with divorced parents, kids with anxiety about college, and foster kids are all marked. They know exactly who's vulnerable. She pulled out another document while her hands shook. Worse now they're expanding to middle schools and planning to recruit eighth graders as dealers. Brother's friend Bram is on their list. I felt my stomach drop thinking about Bram, who played video games at our house every weekend. He still wore superhero shirts and collected Pokemon cards. Look at his file, she said. Single mom who works nights and they're behind on rent. They know exactly what to offer him. They've been watching him for months and documenting his routine. She showed me more files detailing five kids who died from overdoses in two years, with all deaths made to look accidental or like suicides. Teachers were discussing doses in group texts like they were talking about homework assignments. Mr. Lowell handles the AP students personally, she said. He offers them study aids for the SAT s, then gradually increases the doses.

If you hurt that kid, the deal is off and I'm calling the whole thing right now. Whatever she heard next and all the confidence from her voice and she answered, fine, but you get 15 minutes max and then we're gone before the parents suspect anything. She walked back toward the stairs and I realized with this cold, crushing feeling that she wasn't just robbing us, but that someone else was coming and that person wanted to do something to me. And the only reason they hadn't already was because she was apparently the reasonable one in whatever sick plan this was. I waited until I heard her go back downstairs, then crawled to my room on my hands and knees to get my phone from under my pillow where I always hit it during dinner. My fingers were shaking so hard I could barely dial 9, 1 1. But somehow I managed to whisper that someone was in my house and more people were coming.

Where did you get the money? Family meeting tomorrow. Six PM they had no idea what was coming. I'm Marcus, 26, and I've been the invisible son for years. While my parents throw Celebration parties every time my younger sister Emma gets a participation trophy in her dance classes, I quietly became the youngest regional sales director at a tech startup making serious money. The favoritism has been absolutely insane my entire life. When Emma wanted to try violin at 15, they bought her a 2 thousand dollar instrument without hesitation. When I asked for help with college textbook, dad literally handed me a McDonald's application and said, earn it yourself. When she decided violin wasn't for her and wanted to switch to dance, they enrolled her in the most expensive studio in town, paying 400 dollar monthly without blinking. Last month was the absolute final straw. Emma announced she's switching from dance to pottery because she found her true artistic calling. My parents immediately offered to fund a 3,000 dollar pottery wheel Kiln and complete studio setup. Mom was so excited she started researching pottery classes that same night, already planning Emma's artistic future. Meanwhile, I've been living off ramen noodles and sleeping on a mattress on the floor because they told me at 26 I should figure out my own finances and stop being a burden on the Family. When I asked for a small loan to help with a security deposit on a better apartment, dad gave me a 45 minute lecture about fiscal responsibility. The irony, while they were treating me like a complete financial liability, been quietly crushing it at work. Three months ago, I closed the biggest software integration deal in our company's entire history. A Fortune 500 clients signed a three year contract worth two point eight million dollars and my commission structure meant serious money was finally coming my way. That's when I got my quarterly commission check, $47,000 after taxes from that one deal alone, plus my regular salary and performance bonus. Instead of being smart and investing it responsibly, I decided to make a statement that would completely shatter their perception of my life. I walked straight into the Mercedes dealership that afternoon. The AMG C63 s was sitting in the showroom like automotive perfection. Matte black paint, twin turbo V8 engine, four 69 horsepower of pure German engineering. The kind of car that makes people stop mid conversation and just stare in amazement. Salesman initially treated me like I was completely wasting his time. Young guy in jeans and a hoodie looking at a 94,000 dollar car. He barely made eye contact. That changed real quick when I said I wanted to put 30,000 dollars down in cash and finance the rest. Suddenly I was his favorite customer. But here's the absolute genius part I didn't tell anyone about. The car or the commission. I just went about my normal routine for an entire week and my parents continue their narrative about their struggling oldest son who couldn't get his life together. Then last Friday night, I posted one casual Instagram story, nothing fancy, just a photo of my hand on the steering wheel with that iconic three pointed Mercedes star clearly visible in the corner. The caption was simple, new ride. My phone absolutely exploded within an hour. First, it was Emma who screenshot the story and sent it with confused question marks. Then my mom called twice, but I let both calls go straight to voicemail. Finally, dad called with a completely different tone. His voice was serious, almost suspicious. Just Marcus, we need to talk immediately. That car cost more than most people make in an entire year. Family meeting tomorrow, six PM sharp. Don't be late. I showed up 15 minutes early and parked right in their driveway, positioning the car perfectly so they'd see it the moment they walked outside. When dad opened the front door and saw the AMG sitting there, his face went completely white. Mom came up behind him and I watched her mouth actually fall open. So dad said, slowly, if you're involved in something illegal, we need to know right now. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed them my banking app. Account balance, $73,000. Then I handed him my employment contract, my commission statement and my Latest performance review. His hands were literally shaking as he read the numbers. $47,000 commission in one quarter. That's after taxes. I said calmly, the gross was $62,000. Mom was staring at the commission check, then at me, then back at the check. You make more than your father does. Emma just stood there in the doorway looking at the car, then at me like she was seeing me for the first time in her entire life. The golden child suddenly realizing her failure brother had been quietly building an empire while she collected participation trophies. That's when I smiled and said, next time, maybe ask about my life before assuming I'm failing at.

It sounds better than yours. I nodded. Then I quietly returned the eight thousand dollar wedding dress and booked a solo trip. What she found in her closet the next morning left her speechless. We were at the county clerk's office getting our marriage license when Iris dropped the bomb. I'm keeping Richardson, she announced to the confused clerk. But that's your ex husband's name, I said. Obviously. Richardson sounds so much better than Kowalski. Polish names are so harsh and ethnic. Richardson opens doors. The casual racism hit like a slap. But then I remembered something that made my blood freeze. She said this exact thing about her first boyfriend's Italian name years ago. This wasn't just about me. This was a pattern. I signed the papers in silence while she chatted about wedding plans, completely oblivious. That night, I made my own plans. But first I called her ex husband Mateo. Did she keep your name after the divorce for professional reasons? I asked. His bitter laugh told me everything. Professional reasons, dude. She kept it because she thought it sounded classier than her Maiden name. Stevens. She's been lying to everyone. Stevens. Her real name was Stevens. And she was ashamed of that, too. Tuesday morning she left for her spa day. I drove straight to Klein Fields with the receipt. Weddings been called off, I told the manager 15 minutes later. 8,000 $437 was Credited back to my card. But here's what she didn't know. I've been the one making all the payments. Because she'd maxed out her credit cards on designer bags she hid from me. I had receipts for everything. Next stop, the venue. I'm canceling everything. I announced the contract was in my name only. Back $4,500. Bridesmaid dresses, photographer, caterer. I systematically canceled everything I paid for. By three PM, I'd recovered nearly $20,000 of my money. Then I made one more call. To her maid of honor. Corrin. Did you know Iris is embarrassed by ethnic names? What? Her grandmother was Greek. Papadopoulos before Stevens. The hypocrisy was breathtaking. Been ashamed of her own heritage. But the real bombshell. I checked our joint savings. She'd been secretly transferring money for a surprise honeymoon that was actually a trip to see Mateo in California. Flight confirmations in her email. Then came the final touch. In her closet, where her dream dress had hung, I left a note. Since you prefer Richardson to Kowalski, I figured Richardson should pay for your dress. Good luck explaining to Mateo why you were planning to visit him next week. The guy with the harsh name next to it, I hung a Polish flag and printed photos of her flight confirmations. She came home glowing from her spa day. You should see my nails. They're perfect for the wedding. What wedding? I asked support on the coffee table. I canceled everything today. Her face went White. She bolted to the bedroom, then came storming back with my note, the flag, and the flight confirmations. You went through my email? You went through my savings account! Richardson should buy you a new one. This is psychotic. Over a name? Over you planning to cheat with your ex next week? She started calling the boutiques. Each conversation ended the same way. Everything was canceled. Waiting lists were months long. Deposits were gone. Her Instagram influencer dreams crumbled when someone screenshot her old posts about keeping Richardson for professional reasons. The comments were brutal. So you're marrying Richardson again, bro? Dodged a bullet. Her friend group imploded when the group chat leaked. calling Polish names ethnic wasn't her first offensive comment, just the first one that affected someone they knew directly. Her DEI job launched an investigation after HR saw the screenshots. Hard to promote diversity when you're on record being prejudiced against Polish names. Even her ex husband posted on Facebook. For the record, I've been telling Iris to change her name back since our divorce. It's weird. Also, Team Kowalski. Two weeks later I returned from an incredible solo trip to Japan. Found 247 texts, mostly from Iris. Day 7 Mateo heard what happened. He texted me laughing. Her influencer career was dead. Last I heard she's still single. Still Richardson. Still living with her parents. The eight thousand dollar dress hangs unworn in her childhood closet. Me? I'm dating someone new. Also Polish. Thinks Kowalski is a beautiful name. The Polish flag hangs in my living room now, not hidden in a closet. Turns out disrespecting someone's heritage is a great way to end up with no one to marry.

Haha, you are you serious? You're calling me to yell at me about getting on the plane before everybody else? Give me a break. No, I saw you get up and fake a disability to get on the plane before people with real disability you saw that? Yeah, Craig, I saw you do that it's pretty good right?

Called me a gold digger at her own daughter's wedding? I'm at my sister in law's wedding rehearsal dinner, and my mother in law is doing her favorite thing, which is introducing me as my son's wife who stays home because he's such a good provider. She says that to literally every person she sees each time. I try to smile and say, actually, I work from home, but she cuts me off with, yes, yes, keep in. Houses work too, dear. We know. And she's already moving to the next person, literally turning her back mid sentence like I'm a museum display. She's explaining six years of this crap. Six years of her dropping by at 10:00am and saying, must be nice to sleep in when I've been working since 5. His whole family thinks I married him for money, all because I got pregnant three months after we met and had a quickie wedding. I quit my office job to work from my laptop, which to them means I don't work at all. The aunt asks, so you're just home with the kids? And I say, I actually run a business, but she pats my hand going, oh, you have a hobby, how nice. My mother in law laughs, saying she sells things online. It's so cute, like I'm a five year old with a lemonade stand. My husband tries at dinner saying she's actually really successful, but his mom cuts him. Off with stop embarrassing her, honey, not everyone needs to be a career woman. My phone buzzes with another notification I quickly silence. My mother in law tells the wedding planner I've been between jobs for six years when they asked about the extended family of the bride. Not to mention my father in law makes a weekly joke about how I won the lottery marrying his son. The most annoying thing is when my brother in law calls me the professional mom and they all think they're being so clever. Wedding day arrives and it's this garden situation with 150 guests. I'm trying to get the kids ready when my mother in law walks in, seeing my laptop open with spreadsheets showing six figure quarterly reports and goes you shouldn't be playing games while the kids get dressed. Priorities, dear. I say it's actually my quarterly reports, but she's already talking over me. Can you help with flower arrangements since you're not busy during the reception? They seat me at the back table with the kids and elderly relatives, as where else would the housewife sit, right? The bride's college friends are at my table and ask what I do. I start to explain I run an online business, but they turn to each other before I finish saying must be nice to not have real deadlines. And as if summoned, my mother in law walks by, adding she's trying to start a little Etsy shop. Isn't that sweet, The photographer is gathering details for the album, asking about everyone's careers ever. When he gets to me, my mother in law answers for me. She's loved being a homemaker and a professional child raiser. And when I try to correct her, she goes, she's being modest. She runs after two kids all day and everyone laughs. But wait, it gets worse, because mother in law takes the microphone for her toast, and instead of talking about her lawyer daughter, the one getting married, she talks about how special her son is, how successful he is, how handsome he is, then turns to me saying, my son married for love, not money. He provides everything, while his wife gets to enjoy the simple joys of motherhood. Some women are just meant to keep house. I said it as a joke, only no one was laughing. Even the elderly relatives at my table looked uncomfortable. Not even a minute after the speech, the maid of honor, who's a fashion influencer with like two million followers, rushes over to me. I'm

My 17 year old son with down syndrome was arrested for assaulting three grocery store employees and robbing an elderly woman. The police officer's voice was stern when he called me at work. Your son Ali is being detained. He assaulted staff members and stole from a customer. The manager wants to press charges. I actually laughed out loud. Ali, my Ali, the same kid who reads stories to dogs at the shelter because he thinks they get lonely. The officer wasn't amused. Sir, three employees have injuries. You need to come immediately. When I arrived eight minutes later, Ali was sitting on the curb in handcuffs, his Pokemon shirt torn, dirt on his face. But strangest of all, he was smiling. Not his usual sweet smile, but this fierce proud grin I'd never seen before. The store manager, this thin rat faced man, was holding ice against his jaw while a blond female employee showed off scratch marks on her arms to the gathering crowd. Ali, I said, kneeling beside him, what happened? He saw me and his mood brightened. Dad, I saw them trying to scam Missus Yune, the nice grandma from next door. They were making her swipe her card over and over again. The manager immediately started screaming, he's lying. Your retard son is violent and he grabbed money from Missus Yune and attacked us. When we tried to stop him, I stood up ready to Drop this piece of nincompoop for calling my son that. But the officer stepped between us. Sir, control yourself. But regardless of what he was saying, I knew my son would never do something like that. Ali, I said, ignoring everyone else, focus on my voice. Tell me exactly what happened. His smile faded as he tried to focus. It started when I saw Missus Yune and she looked super confused. The blonde employee rolled her eyes. Oh, great. The moron is going to tell us a story. I took a step toward her, but Ali grabbed my hand and kept talking. She was at the self checkout. It kept saying error. I saw the yellow haired lady telling Missus Yune to swipe her card again and again and again. He held up his fingers seven times. Dad, I counted. The blonde employee looked like she was about to burst in anger. Shut up. But the officer held up his hand for silence. Ali continued, his voice getting stronger. Mrs. Yun said she already paid. She showed them her receipt, but the employee told her that she had to keep swiping or she couldn't leave with her groceries. Dad, remember how you warned me that's how bad people steal. They make you swipe lots of times, then take all the money. My blood was boiling now. Yes, I remember, buddy. Then what happened? I went over, I said, excuse me, that's not nice. You're tricking her. The lady called me. The R word and said I was too stupid to understand grown up things. Ali's face scrunched up at the memory and he looks scared. But I understand stealing is wrong. So I told Missus Yune to call 9 1 1. I said these people are doing crimes to you. The manager's face was purple. Now this moron doesn't know what he's talking about. Ali kept going. That's when the man grabbed Missus.

I saw my six year old daughter standing outside freezing in the snow. I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently in just her school clothes, no coat, tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said. I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up feeling how ice cold her little body was and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key, fury building with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected, sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was crank up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning. I told her actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's pink Backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never or seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me, nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. If the room started spinning, what are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving tonight. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter. Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual, cruel.

Everyone laughed except me. I quietly raised my hot dog and said, challenge accepted. That night, I packed everything into two suitcases and left my key on the kitchen counter. No, no, no. Goodbye. Just gone. I've been the family doormat for 29 years, the one who organised every holiday, baked free birthday cake and cleaned up everyone's messes while they took selfies without me. So when mom made that joke at our B B Q with my aunts and siblings all laughing, something inside me just clicked. I moved three hours away to a lakeside cabin, blocked everyone's numbers and started over as Jade instead of JD, the nickname that made me feel like a child. For the first week, my phone stayed silent, exactly like mom predicted. But Week 2, 2, my brother called 47 times. Turns out nobody knew how to work the washing machine I've been maintaining for years. Their clothes piled up like a laundry mountain until he finally had to buy new underwear instead of figuring out the spin cycle. Week 3, my sister showed up at my old job crying, begging my former co workers for my new number. She had a family emergency, aka, couldn't figure out how to renew her car registration, the same registration I've been handling for her since she was 16. My co workers told Her I'd moved states away. She broke down in the parking lot because she'd never even Learned where the DMV was located. She ended up paying $300 to some sketchy guy who promised to handle it. Month 2, Dad drove to every apartment complex in the city looking for me. He'd never realised I was the one who remembered everyone's medication schedules, grocery lists and which bills were due when without me. He missed his blood pressure medication for three weeks and had to go to urgent care. The doctor asked if he had family support at home. Dad just stared at the or and mumbled something about his daughter being away. Mom had a complete breakdown when she realized I've been handling all the family birthdays, anniversary reminders and doctor appointments for decades. She forgot her own sister's birthday for the first time in 40 years and had to hear about it at Sunday dinner. The woman who said nobody would notice was now hiring a professional organizer for $200 a week to do what I've done for free my entire adult life. Even then, the organize.

I was halfway through our Valentine's sleepover at Sophie's, laughing at Maya's impression of her hinge date when my phone lit up. It was my best friend Chloe. So I saw you posted that you're wearing the blue dress to my birthday brunch tomorrow. Yeah, we need to talk about that. The room got quiet. Sophie stopped mid stroke on Jess's pinky nail. Okay, I'm not trying to be a bitch, but when you wear it, you look like a stuffed sausage. It's really embarrassing. She pause to examine her lashes. Remember Brad's pool party when you wore that bikini, and I told you everyone was judging you? This is gonna be worse. I'm just being honest because I love you. Click. He hung up before I could even process. Everyone was staring at me. 20 seconds of pure silence while my face filled with heat and I tried not to cry. Guys, she didn't mean it like that. She's just an honest person. Oh, hell nah. Maya actually threw her nail polish bottle onto the couch. Did that hoe just call you a stuffed sausage? The girl from Sophie's work who I just met tonight said, girl, what the actual fuck? Maya was already scrolling through Chloe's Instagram. This bitch. Maya held up her phone. She literally posted about body positivity yesterday. Wait, wait, wait. Sophie said, isn't her birthday brunch at that bougie place downtown? The one where all the influencers go? I Nodded, still trying to stop crying. Jess, who never swears, said, fuck this. Girl. Girls, new plan. The energy shift was instant. Suddenly everyone was huddled around me like we were planning a heist. Sophie pulled up the revolve website. What dress is it? I showed them the blue midi with the cut out back. Okay, it's in stock, so he said, adding it to her cart. What size? Within five minutes, every single girl had ordered the same dress in their size. Overnight shipping. Still, I defended her, blissfully unaware of what a good friend is meant to look like. But guys, this isn't necessary. It's just the way she is. Girl, I love you, but you need to shut the fuck up, because this is happening, Maya said, still furiously scrolling through Chloe's socials. Oh, this is gold. She told everyone she's 24 tomorrow. This bitch is turning 27. How do you know? I asked, pretending to be surprised because I found her college graduation photos from 2020. Do the math. By 3:00am, they'd found her real age, her actual job, MLM, her face tune fails, and the fact that she'd been telling people she got into Cornell when she went to community college. Nothing wrong with that. But lying? Guys, is this too mean? I don't want her to be sad on her birthday. Girl, we're giving her exactly what she wants, Maya said with a smirk. She wants all the attention in her dress. she'll Be the only one not in blue and get all the attention she wants. Even I couldn't argue with that. Like, she kinda ate. The next morning, my friends wouldn't let me check my phone. They did my makeup, hyped me up, and we all got dressed together. Six girls in almost identical maxi dresses. Girl, the body is bodying! Sophie exclaimed. Eight down! Maya yelled, cheekily, slapping my ass. It was the first time girls had hyped me up like that, and I couldn't even hide my smile. We rolled up to the restaurant together. I could see Chloe through the window at a long table, wearing black, surrounded by her sorority sisters. She saw us approaching and her face went through like five different expressions. Happy birthday, babe! Maya said way too loudly as we walked in. Happy 27th! The table went silent. One of

My mom is the academic baddie of the family. She has three degrees and one PhD, all from Ivy Leagues. And whenever I won an academic award, she'd brag about it for weeks, say it was all because of her. That was her thing. It was like she still wanted to hang on to her glory days. Well, I wasn't going to be the one to ruin that. So when she wanted all of my college application essays to go through her first, I let her. After all, she was the one to get my GPA up to 4.2. But then something strange happened. No college was accepting me, and I never received a single rejection email either. Instead, I got angry, sometimes even threatening ones like Harvard, who said my essay was a disgrace, or brown, who threatened to have me blacklisted from other schools. It was around this time that I started to notice a pattern. Every time I got rejected, she got this look in her eyes like she'd known all along, like she wanted it that way. But there was only one college I actually wanted to go to, university of North Carolina at Charlotte. I never told my mom about it because it wasn't an Ivy League. Plus, I didn't want her to think I was a failure for not getting accepted into yet another college. But then something strange happened. I got an interview within just two weeks. Of applying. They told me I was exactly the kind of student they were looking for. And that evening, I couldn't help myself. I did the craziest thing known to mankind. I told my mother. And despite everything, I still expected her to jump up with excitement or at least smile. But no. Instead, she just said, that's wonderful, sweetie, but don't get too excited. You don't want to be disappointed. I stared at her blankly. It was the first time I asked myself whether my mom really wanted the best for me. And I reminded myself about all the hours she had put into making me study, how my GPA was only high because of her. So I told myself the same thing she's always said to me, that I was being ungrateful. But after a week, I finally snapped because my dream college told me I was the perfect candidate. But week later, I got the email from U N. C. Charlotte. There it was in plain red, Ariel font, rejected. It was the nastiest email I had ever seen. Didn't even mention my grades, just talked about my poor character. But I wasn't confused. I knew that somehow my mom was behind it. So I stopped telling her anything, found a tiny school 3 states away that she never heard of, applied in secret, got in, packed my car the day after graduation and left while she was at her stupid book club for the first few Weeks, she called me every day but I never picked up because every time she would leave me a cute little voice recording, it was 5 minutes long where she described how much of an embarrassment I was to the family name. Another said I was sabotaging everything she had worked for and my favorite, that I was going to end up in a dead end job at 30 and end up dying alone. Like, mom, isn't that you? Lol. Anyway, I blocked her after that and most of my family took my side. Fast forward 5 years and I'm now a paralegal with an amazing salary and perspective job. I was in the middle of joking to my coworker about how we both thought we never get into college when she asked what my GPA was, 4.2 dash. What? What? She exclaimed. How the EF did you struggle to get in? Before I could even respond, she picked up her phone and called her dad. My dad's a college admission officer. Sorry, but I need to know what happened. I just smiled. Daisy had always been a little quirky. Daddy, do you know his effery encounter my name? By this point, I was almost killed over from how hard I was laughing, swatting the phone to try and get her to give up. But as soon as he responded, my body went still from 2,019 to Harvard. Daisy was smiling, I wasn't. Yes, daddy, I knew your memory was Still good. Why didn't she get.

One day my daughter came back from school and ran into my arms like she was scared. I could feel her shaking so I took her inside and made some French toast, which was her favorite food. I thought she just had a really bad day and missed being at home. But I couldn't have been more wrong. Once she calmed down, she told me, Mommy, something happened today and I think I'm supposed to tell you about it. An uneasy knot formed itself in my heart when she told me that the school counselor had called her into his office for a special game. He handed my daughter a stuffed unicorn and told her that this new game was very popular with the children, which made my daughter excited and eager to learn. Then the counselor made her point the unicorn between his legs and push on it repeatedly. My daughter told me how he made weird faces at times and then closed his eyes and leaned back. Towards the end, I was so horrified and felt a wave of nausea rush through my body so I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. What kind of sick person would make a 7 year old girl do this kind of thing? Not to mention he worked at a school and it was me who willfully sent my daughter near his vicinity. I kept Bouncing between blaming myself and wanting to burn the entire world. My husband was no longer with us, so it was up to me to stand up for my daughter. I don't know what made me approach the school administration before the police, but that's exactly what I did. And the school administration laughed at me, saying that my daughter was clearly playing a prank. They said they had heard other students make similar jokes about the school counselor and said that parents should teach their kids not to lie. By the time I made it to the police station, the school had already called them and explained the situation. They thought I was a crazy mother who was trying to give merit to my daughter's filthy lie. I had looked straight into my daughter's eyes when she told me the story, so I knew she was telling the truth. But no one wanted to believe me. And I felt like I was in a nightmare. This is when I remembered something important and ran back home to open my jewelry safe. Inside there was a note that I hadn't looked at for a long time. You see, although I was currently a doctor, I had been a very inexperienced nurse at one point. And one time a very stern looking man with a lot of face tattoos walked into our hospital with a bullet wound. No other nurse wanted to treat him since he looks so scary. So they Sent me. I convinced myself that everyone deserves treatment and cleaned his wounds with the utmost concentration. I even engaged him in conversation and joked about how he should stay away from bullets in the future. When it was all over, the guy thanked me and handed me a note with his phone number on it. He said, if you ever need someone taken care of, I won't ask for any payment. I typed in that phone number and to my surprise, it actually connected. I told him who I was and he said, I remember you.

Ashley on some yacht wearing basically a string bikini, sitting on some guy's lap while he popped champagne. Videos of her dancing with a bunch of rich dudes, them doing body shots off her stomach. Best day ever. With location tag, Miami Beach. We live in Jersey. When she came back Sunday night, sunburnt and hungover, I was furious. Where the f were you? She rolled her eyes. Tom invited me to his yacht party last minute. It was a networking opportunity. Tom was some crypto guy who'd been dming her for months. You went to Miami without telling me? She laughed, actually laughed. It was last minute, babe. These chances don't come often. When I showed her the videos of her grinding on those guys, she shrugged. It's a boat thing. Everyone was dancing. Don't be so uptight. You're in a relationship, I yelled. Yeah. And I came back, didn't I? She ruffled my hair like I was a child. I could have stayed in Miami. Tom has this insane condo. He wanted to fly me to Ibiza next week. She pinched my cheek. But I came back to Jersey to my little computer nerd, my anxious overthinker who's mad about a boat party. She kicked off her heels and collapsed on my bed. I looked past all these red flags with rose colored glasses until the one year anniversary incident happened. I planned everything perfectly just for her on our anniversary. Flowers in hand, campaign in my car, reservation at her favorite restaurant. I was about to knock on her apartment door to surprise her when I heard voices through her open window. Ashley and her friends, all Instagram model types who made fun of me whenever they visited. Ash, I still don't get it. Her friend Jenna was saying, why are you with him? You could have literally anyone. I kept closer to the window, still holding the roses like an idiot. Ashley laughed. You want to know a secret? He'll never leave me, ever. I could do anything and he'd take it. I have complete freedom. I go to Miami. He waits. I hang with my exes. He deals with it. Tom keeps flying me places. Brad takes me to dinner. But this one, she laughed again. He worships me, like actually worships me. But don't you want someone better? Another voice. Asked eventually, yeah. But you know how Brad destroyed my confidence when he cheated with that bartender? This one looks at me like I'm God. He tells me I'm perfect every morning, begs me not to leave him. I need that right now. I heard them all giggling. Once I feel like myself again, I'll find someone on my level. But for now, he's exactly what my ego needs, like therapy but free. They all burst out laughing. I stood there, flowers in hand, and knew something had to change. She needed me for her ego. Time to take away her supply. I spent the next two weeks planning exactly how to.

For as long as I can remember, my sister Claire has tried to compete with me. She's two years older, but whenever I achieved something, she found a way to one up me. When I got engaged, she got engaged six months later. When I bought my first house, she bought one down the street. But nothing compared to what she did when I got pregnant. My husband and I struggled for years with infertility. After two heartbreaking miscarriages and countless doctor visits, we finally got the news that we were expecting. It felt like a miracle. From the moment I saw those two pink lines, I already knew the name I wanted for my daughter. My grandmother raised me. After my dad passed and my mom checked out, she was my entire world. Her name was Evangeline. And before she passed, she used to say, if you ever have a little girl, I hope she carries my name. I told Claire the name one night when I was three months pregnant. I thought we were having a sister moment. She smiled and said it was beautiful. I should have known better. Two months later, Claire announced she was pregnant, too. She acted surprised and thrilled that our babies would grow up together. I was genuinely happy for her. Until the family baby shower she threw for herself. As I walked into the decorated venue, I saw a giant sign that nearly knocked the breath out of me. Welcome baby of Evangeline. I froze. I thought it had to be a coincidence, but now Claire got up and made a speech about how she always loved our grandmother's name and how it was perfect for her daughter. I pulled her aside after the speeches, trying to keep my voice steady. Claire, you knew I was naming my daughter of Evangeline? She smirked and shrugged. Well, I'm due first. Nothing stopping you from picking something else. I was stunned. My entire family just stood there awkwardly pretending not to take sides. My mom even whispered, it's just a name, honey. But it wasn't. It was the one promise I made to my grandmother. I went home that night and cried harder than I ever had through our infertility journey. But the longer I sat there, the more my sadness hardened into something else. Termination. If Claire wanted to play dirty, fine, but she underestimated me. I spent the next few weeks quietly gathering every piece of paperwork I needed. See, Claire hadn't actually filed any legal paperwork yet. She was calling the baby Evangeline, but hadn't registered the name officially. Meanwhile, I expedited my own legal name reservation with the state. In our state, you can pre

Hi. Is Nicole there? Yes, it's Nicole. Hey, Nicole. How are you? My name is Jubal and I host a morning radio show called Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Okay. How can I help you? Well, I'm calling you today because we recently got an email into our show from somebody who's trying to get a hold of you. Someone trying to get a hold of me? Yeah. Apparently they've tried to call you a bunch and you're not responding to them. So they asked if maybe we could get you on the phone. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I'm a little confused. It's a segment that we do on our show called The 2nd Date. It's where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up not calling them back, they email us to see if we can get you on the phone and find out what happened. Oh, jeez. So the guy's name is Ed, and you know Ed from your rock climbing group. Oh, my God. Yeah, I do. I know him well. Ed emailed us because he said that when you guys were supposed to go out, you ended up saying you had to rain check it to help your friend out with a flat tire. But since then, you haven't talked to him or even shown up to the rock climbing group. He's giving you a lot of information. Um, what else did he tell you? God, that's pretty much It, he just told us that you guys met at class and we're supposed to go out and then you, he thinks you made up an excuse. Uh, I did, but I think he's leaving out a big part of the story. Really? He did, he did something weird, didn't he? I know he did something weird at your house. I definitely classify it as weird. Yeah. Okay. So what happened? Oh, God, this is so embarrassing. Is it like what, what did Ed tell you about our, about our date? He said that you guys were at your rock climbing class and then after you were supposed to go somewhere, so you went back to your house to shower and then.

My son came into my room fully dressed for school and just stood there in the doorway like he was waiting to be punished. I asked what was wrong and he said, can I stay home today? I feel really sad. I don't know why. I just don't wanna go. At first I almost gave him the response I was raised on. Life doesn't stop just because you're in a mood. But the way he said it, it didn't sound like a kid trying to skip class. It sounded like a kid trying not to cry from something much worse. I told him to go sit down while I got ready, then walked into the bathroom and locked the door. I needed a second to breathe because something about it hit too hard. Not the sadness, the fact that he asked. As a kid, I was taught to hide feelings like that, to bury them deep, never speak them out loud, and especially never expect kindness afterward. So I took a breath, came out and told him, alright, you're staying home, but you're not in trouble. And I'm not mad. He kept looking at me like he was waiting for the butt. There wasn't one. We spent the day doing nothing worth posting about. We didn't talk about why he felt sad. I didn't try to fix it. I just let him exist. We made lunch, watched something stupid, and sat on the couch. Like the world wasn't pressing down on either of us. At one point, he looked over and asked, do you ever feel sad for no reason? I nodded more times than I can count. He didn't say anything else, just leaned against me and closed his eyes. That night, while he brushed his teeth, he looked at me in the mirror and said, I thought you'd be mad. Last time I cried, you told me to act my age. I. I didn't even remember saying that, but apparently he did. After he went to bed, I stayed up cleaning the living room. I found his backpack under the blanket he had curled up in, and when I unzipped it to pull out his lunch box, I saw a folded sheet of paper tucked between two math work sheets. It wasn't a school assignment. It was a note written in pencil, erased and rewritten more than once. It said, I don't want to feel this way anymore, but if I tell someone, they'll make me feel worse for not wanting to be alive.

I hated group projects more than anything in college. Every single time I'd end up doing all the work while everyone else just showed up for the grade. So when Professor Williams assigned our final ethics project worth 30% of our grade, I swore things would be different this time. The professor randomly put me with three students I barely knew, Alex, Jordan and Sam. I was actually excited because maybe working with strangers would mean they'd actually care about their grades. Boy, was I wrong. I made a group chat the same day and sent detailed messages about meeting times, dividing up the work and setting deadlines. Radio silence. I tried again the next day. Nothing. I even walked up to Alex after class and asked if he got my messages. He just shrugged and said, yeah, we'll figure it out later. Two weeks passed. The 20 page research paper was due in 10 days and nobody had written a single word. I kept sending messages, trying to set up meetings, offering to do video calls. They left me on read every single time. I had a choice. I could let our whole group fail or I could do what I always did. So I spent the next week pulling all nighters, researching corporate ethics scandals, writing analysis after analysis, adding proper citations and references, 23 pages of solid work. I was exhausted but proud when I Submitted it online. I only put my name on it, not theirs, just mine. The very next morning, the day before our presentation, my phone started buzzing like crazy. Alex was calling me over and over. When I finally picked up, he sounded panicked. Hey, Maya, we're all ready to present now. Just make sure you add our names back to the title slide before class. Okay? I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Add your names back. You guys didn't help write anything. Come on, don't be like that. We're a team. Just put us on there. I hung up. 20 minutes later, Sam was knocking on my dorm room door, acting all friendly like we were best friends. Maya, hey, we just wanna make sure everything's good for tomorrow. We can all present different sections. What sections did you write? I asked. Well, we didn't technically write them, but we can present them. That's basically the same thing, right? I told her no and closed the door. That's when things got ugly. They emailed Professor Williams that same night, claiming I had excluded them maliciously from the project and refused to collaborate. They said I was trying to take all the credit for work they had done. They even said I deleted their contributions from the shared document. Professor Williams replied to all of us the next morning. He said there would be a hearing after class where each person would be graded individually based on what they Could prove they contributed. When I walked into the classroom for our presentation, my three group members were already there with printed papers and fake concerned expressions. They had actually printed out what looks like rough drafts with their names on them. During the hearing, they went first. Alex claimed he had written the entire introduction and that I had deleted it and rewritten it in my own words. Jordan said he had researched all the case studies, but I had stolen his work. Sam said she had done the conclusion, but I had cut her out completely. They showed Professor Williams.

She returned 6 years later to find I divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation to our 8 year olds. That first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curve ball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year 2 brought unexpected changes without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how To enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her Bonus Mom, their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes and tucked them in at night. Year 5 was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and, and being the mom who stayed. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year 6, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor role. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward after Three years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we. I watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck, pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place. Eleanor was packing the twins lunches for.

So my brother Jake got married, like, three weeks ago, and the whole thing was basically a slap in the face. His wife Megan, decided nobody under 21 could come because they were serving alcohol and didn't want any minors getting drunk. I was 19 at the time, which apparently made me some kind of liability. The excuse was complete bullshit, and everyone knew it. I don't even drink that much. Maybe a beer here and there with friends, but I'm not some alcoholic teenager who's gonna embarrass their precious wedding. But whatever. That's what they decided, and my parents just went along with it, like always. I asked them to reconsider a few times because, honestly, it hurt. Jake and I used to be close growing up. We shared a room until I was 14, played video games together, the whole thing. But ever since he started dating Megan two years ago, she's basically been calling all the shots. She thinks she's better than everyone because her dad owns some car dealership and she went to private school. After they kept saying no, I just stopped caring. If I wasn't good enough for their wedding, then fine. I wasn't gonna beg anymore. Then last Saturday rolls around, and Jake texts our family group chat saying he wants everyone to go to some fancy steakhouse to celebrate the wedding. My parents Were all excited, talking about how nice it would be to finally celebrate as a family, but I just replied that I wasn't going. My mom called me right away asking why not? I told her the same thing I told everyone else. I didn't see the point in celebrating something I wasn't even invited to. She tried to guilt trip me, saying it would mean a lot to Jake and that my cousins Becca and Tyler were going even though they didn't get invited either. But here's the thing. Becca is 13 and Tyler is 15. Their parents literally forced them to go. They didn't have a choice. I'm 19, I pay my own phone Bill, I work at Best Buy part time, and I'm starting community college in the fall. I can make my own decisions about where I spend my Saturday night. My parents kept trying to convince me all week. My dad even offered to pay for my meal, which honestly just made it worse. Like, you couldn't fight for me to be at the actual wedding, but now you wanna throw money at me to show up to the Celebration dinner? The night of the dinner, I. I stayed home and ordered pizza. I was playing call of duty with my friends when my phone started blowing up. First it was Jake texting me asking where I was. Then Megan sent me this long paragraph about how disappointed she was that I couldn't be mature enough. To support my brother's happiness. Funniest part is they acted all surprised that I didn't show up. I literally told them I wasn't going. What did they expect? After they got home from dinner, Jake came to my room and tried to have some.

When I tell people my 12 year old daughter only speaks to five people in the entire world, they think I'm exaggerating. I'm not. After what her father did to her? Years of abuse that started when she was barely old enough to form memories, trust became a foreign concept. She talks to me, her aunt, her grandparents, and her best friend. That's it. Touch her unexpectedly and she might have a panic attack. Ask her a direct question if you're not on that list, and she'll stare at the floor until you give up. Her Nintendo Switch is her lifeline. It's the only place where she feels completely safe, where she has control and where no one can hurt her. She takes it everywhere, clutching it like armor against a world that's already proven it can be cruel. I used to worry about the addiction until her therapist explained it. It's her safe space. Let her have it. I met Lucas eight months ago. I didn't tell him about Maddie for the first three months, not because I was hiding her, but because I needed to be sure. She'd only met two of my dates in the eight years since her father left, and both times ended in disasters that set her progress back months. The first one tried to high five her. She didn't speak for three days. The second brought her A teddy bear, and tried to hug her. The panic attack lasted an hour. Lucas was different from the start. When I finally told him about Maddie, about the abuse, about the silence, about the switch that never left her hands, he didn't do what the others did. He didn't say, I'm great with kids or she'll warm up to me. He just said, I'll just follow your lead. We waited another two months before they met. I planned it carefully. A brief encounter at our apartment. No pressure, no expectations. Maddie knew he was coming. She sat on the couch with her switch headphones on, already retreating into her digital world. Lucas walked in, gave her a small wave. She didn't return, and then did something unexpected. He pulled out his own switch and sat in the chair across the room, not next to her, not trying to see her screen, just playing his own game. Twenty minutes passed in silence. Then Maddie's head tilted slightly. I saw her glancing at his screen. Another 10 minutes go by and she pause her game. I held my breath. Is that Mario Kart? Her voice was so quiet I almost missed it. Lucas looked up. Casual as anything. Yeah, the new one. Do you play? She nodded. I'm terrible at Rainbow Road, he said, then went back to playing. Five minutes later, I can beat Rainbow Road. No way. It's impossible. And just like that, my silent daughter was offended enough. To speak again. It's not impossible. I have three stars on every cup. Lucas paused his game, looking genuinely impressed. Every cup? Even 2 hundred C C? She actually sat up straighter. Especially 2 hundred C C. Prove it. I watched, stunned as Maddie scooted to the edge of the couch, not closer to him. She maintained that careful distance, but engaged. We could race online. They exchanged friend codes without ever leaving their separate spaces. For the next hour, they played Mario Kart together while sitting eight feet apart. Maddie didn't just play, she trash talked. You're about to eat my dust, she muttered after selecting her character when she won the first race. She actually smiled when Lucas Blue shelled her on the third lap of

My brother Jordan married Nicole last year after a whirlwind romance. She always acted sweet around family, but something about her felt off to me, like she was performing rather than being genuine. I work as a barista at Grind Coffee, a local shop downtown. It's not glamorous, but I love the regular customers, and my manager, Kevin, is pretty cool about everything. Nicole knows where I work, but. And she doesn't. Every Tuesday, Nicole comes in with her book club friends. They order complicated drinks, leave messes, and tip poorly. Nicole acts like she's never seen me before in her life, which is weird, but whatever. I figured she was embarrassed about her brother in law being a coffee shop worker. Last Tuesday changed everything. Nicole walks in around two PM, but not with her book club. She's with this tall guy in an expensive suit, definitely not my brother. They're all over each other, kissing at the counter, his hands all over her waist. She's giggling like a teenager. I'm making their drinks, trying to process what I'm seeing. This woman is married to my brother, wearing her wedding ring, and making out with a stranger in public. Then she turns around and sees me behind the espresso machine. Her face goes completely white. She quickly steps away from the guy, starts acting normal, but it's too late. I saw everything. They order their drinks without making eye contact with me. Nicole whispers something to the guy and they leave quickly. I'm standing there in shock, not sure what to do with this information. The next morning, I get a call from Kevin before my shift. Hey, we need to talk when you get in. Someone filed a complaint about you. My Spino drops at work. Kevin explains that a cuss banner called corporate claiming I was unprofessional, rude, and made inappropriate comments about her personal life. I'm getting an official write up. I know immediately it was Nicole. She's trying to get me fired before I can tell Jordan what I saw. It's actually kind of smart in a twisted way. But here's the thing about our coffee shop. We have security cameras everywhere. Kevin installed them after some theft issues last year. And Kevin's been managing for 10 years. He knows when cuss there are lying. I explain the whole situation to him. How Nicole is my sister in law, how I saw her cheating, and how now she's trying to destroy my job to silence me. Kevin listens without judgment. Wanna see what really happened? He asks, pulling up yesterday's footage on his computer. There it is, clear as day. Nicole walking in with mystery man. Them kissing passionately by the windows. Her wedding ring glinting in the sunlight as she runs her fingers through his hair. Me behind the counter, professional the entire time. Never saying a word to them, Kevin watches the whole thing, then deletes the plaint from corporate system. This never happened, he says, printing out still frames from the video. But you might want these. Family dinner is this Sunday at our parents house. Nicole shows up in a new dress, acting extra sweet to everyone. She keeps glancing at me nervously throughout the meal. During dessert, she leans over with fake concern. How's work going, honey? No problems with difficult cause banners, I hope. You know how some people can be so unreasonable. The whole table is listening. My parents love Nicole. Think she's perfect for Jordan. My brother is completely clueless, cutting his cake with a smile. I smile back at her. Actually works been really interesting lately. We had the situation yesterday with a married woman who came in with her boyfriend. Really awkward when she realized her husband's sister worked there. The table goes quiet. Forks stop moving. Jordan looks confused, glancing between me and Nicole. What do you mean? Jordan asks slowly. Nicole's face is red now. She's just making things up. You know how dramatic she can be. I pull out my phone, show Jordan the security footage still frames Kevin printed for me. This is from Tuesday at two PM. Recognize anyone? Jordan takes the photos, his face changing as he processes what he's seeing. Nicole in another man's arms, kissing him passionately, her wedding ring visible in every shot. Who is this Guy Jordan's voice is barely a whisper. Nicole starts screaming that I'm lying, that the photos are fake, that I'm jealous of their marriage and trying to destroy it. She's

His parents showed up at our door in March without even asking. His mom literally called and told me they were coming to wait out quarantine at our place. Like, not asked, told me. And I already knew this was gonna suck because they've always treated me like garbage. They make these snide comments about everything I do, act like they own the place, and basically think I'm not good enough for their precious son. Right from day one, they started running our apartment like it was theirs. They tell me what to cook, when to clean, how loud my music could be. But the worst part was the stupid air conditioning fight that went on for weeks. It's been like 85 degrees every single day here, and I keep the AC at 70 because that's comfortable, but nope. They started whining about being cold, so I compromised and put it at 75. I'm already sweating my butt off, but whatever. I'm trying to keep the peace. That wasn't good enough, though. They wanted the heat on in 90 degree weather. The heat. I'd wake up in the middle of the night, literally drenched in sweat because they'd sneak over and crank the thermostat up to, like, 80 degrees. I told them to stop messing with it probably 20 times, but they kept doing it anyway. So yesterday morning before work, I grabbed a Roll of duct tape and put, like, 10 pieces over the thermostat. I even wrote a note that said, do not touch the thermostat while I am at work. In big letters. Pretty clear, right? I get home at six PM, and it hits me like a wall of heat the second I open the door. It's hotter inside than it is outside, which shouldn't even be possible. The duct tape is ripped off, my note is crumpled up on the floor, and they've got the heat cranked to 98 freaking degrees. 98! I checked the thermostat three times because I couldn't believe it. I marched straight to the guest room, where they're just chilling like nothing happened. His mom is sitting there filing her nails, and his dad is watching some cooking show. I'm like, dripping sweat already, and I go, why could you not follow the simple instruction of do not touch the thermostat? This is my home! I'm tired of you saying rude things to me. I'm tired of you treating me like a child and making your own rules for my apartment. You either need to respect me and my boundaries or go back to your own house. Mom doesn't even look up from her nails at first. Then she gets this nasty look on her face and says, you have no right to barge in here without knocking. That was not only an invasion of privacy, but you need to take the attitude out of Your tone. I've dealt with much bigger bitches than you before. That's when I completely lost it. She called me a bitch in my own apartment, after I let them stay here for free, after I've been bending over backwards trying to make them comfortable, after they've been treating me like dirt for months. She kept going on and on for, like, 30 minutes about how disrespectful I am and how I need to learn my place and all this other garbage. I just stood there letting her dig her own grave. When she finally shut up, I looked at both of them and said, get out. Pack your stuff and get out of my apartment right now. His dad tried to jump in, like, now hold on. Let's all calm down here, but I cut him off. No, you heard what she said. She called me a bitch in my own home. Get out! They started arguing that they had nowhere else to go and that I was being dramatic. I told them that wasn't my problem and they had one hour to pack their bags before I called the cops. His mom started crying and saying I was ruining their family, but I was done.

I also canceled the two surprises I planned as a gift. I've been secretly paying for the premium open bar package. And upgraded their honeymoon suite to the penthouse. All in all, I was covering about $8,000 worth of upgrades she didn't even know about. Each vendor I call is shocked when I explain this situation. The cake baker actually says, after everything you've done for her. But I just tell them I need to cancel, and they all understand. Some of them even refuse to work with her if she tries to. The venue calls her three days later to confirm cancellation. That's when my phone starts going off crazy. 47 missed calls in an hour. When I finally answer, she's hyperventilating. What did you do to my wedding? She screams so loud, I have to hold the phone away from my ear. The venue wants $12,000 for a last minute booking. The florist won't even return her calls. The photographer is booked. The caterer says they have no record of her event. I let her rant for a solid minute before I calmly explained that all those vendors were my connections, my accounts, my negotiations. You said you didn't want anything from me, remember? She starts sobbing about how the wedding is in 11 days and everything is ruined, and how could I do this to her? You literally told me not to come. I reminded her these Were all my favors to call in, not yours? She tries to guilt trip me, saying I'm ruining the most important day of her life. Frisa, you said good. When I told you I'd have to cancel everything, you hung up on me. She calls me a jealous bitch and says she'll never forgive me. That's fine, I tell her.

But honestly, if she really felt that threatened by me just existing in a bridesmaid dress, then fine. I told her, okay, if that's what you want. She sounded surprised, like she expected me to beg or cry or something. That night, I started going through all my emails. Every vendor communication is in my inbox because I'm the one who's been handling everything. The venue, that's my boss's country club and he gave us the friends and family discount. The florist, she, the client from my job, the photographer, charging $2,000 instead of his usual $6,000. I designed his entire website portfolio for free last year. The caterer, the DJ, the bartenders, even the hair and makeup team, they're all doing this as favors to me, not her. My sister has no idea that every single contract is technically under my name. The next morning, I called Brisa one more time. Just so you know, if I'm not part of the wedding, I'll need to cancel all the arrangements I made through my connections. She immediately snaps back, good, I don't want anything from you. Anyway, she hung up before I could say anything. I don't think she had any clue what that meant. I spent the rest of that day making calls. First, the venue. I explained that I won't be attending the wedding anymore, so I need to cancel the reservation I made. My boss is confused but says no. Problem next, the florist. She's actually offended when I tell her what happened and says she wouldn't work with my sister now, even if she begged. The photographer is booked solid and happily takes another wedding for that date at his full rate. One by one, I cancel everything, the caterer, the DJ, the cake baker.

So I've been helping my older sister Brisa, plan her wedding since the day she got engaged. We're talking eight months of venue tours, cake tastings and colour swatching. Every shade of blush pink known to mankind. She called me her angel sister to everyone, bragging about how she couldn't imagine doing any of this without me. We spent every Sunday together working on centrepieces, addressing invitations, making those little favour bags. Never once did we argue about anything. Then, two weeks before her big day, we're at the final bridesmaid dress fitting downtown. I step out of the dressing room in this dusty rose dress she picked, and I watch her face just completely change. She goes quiet for the rest of the appointment, barely looks at me. That night, I'm meal prepping for the week when my phone rings. We need to talk about the wedding, she says, and her voice is ice cold. I'm thinking maybe there's a vendor issue or something. But then she hits me with, you're out of the wedding party. Actually, don't even come to the wedding at all. She tells me I looked too good in the bridesmaid dress and she won't have me stealing attention on her special all day. I literally laughed because I thought she was joking. We're sisters. I offered to wear a different dress, do my hair different, wear less makeup. Literally anything. But she's dead serious. This is my wedding and my day. I don't want you there. I could have fought her on it, could have called our parents, made it into this whole family drama. But honestly, if she really felt that threatened by me just existing in a bridesmaid dress, then fine. I told her, okay, if that's what you want. She sounded surprised, like she expected me to beg or cry or something. That night, I started going through all my emails. Every vendor communication is in my inbox because I'm the one who's been handling everything. The venue, that's my boss's country club, and he gave us the friends and family discount. The florist, she's a client from my job. The photographer, charging $2,000 instead of his usual six thousand dollars. I designed his entire website portfolio for free last year. The caterer, the DJ, the bartenders, even the hair and makeup team. They're all doing this as favors to me, not her. My sister has no idea that every single contract is technically under my name. The next morning, I called Brisa one more time. Just so you know, if I'm not part of the wedding, I'll need to cancel all the arrangements I made through my connections. She immediately snaps back, good, I don't want anything from you. Anyway, she hung up before I could say anything. I don't think she had any clue what that meant. I spent the rest of that day making Calls first, the venue. I explained that I won't be attending the wedding anymore, so I need to cancel the reservation I made. My boss is confused, but says no problem. Next, the florist. She's actually offended when I tell her what happened and says she wouldn't work with my sister now even if she begged. The photographer is booked solid and happily takes another wedding for that date at his full rate. One by one, I cancel everything the caterer, the DJ, the cake baker, who was doing a five tier for the price of three. I also canceled the two surprises I planned as a gift. I've been secretly paying for the premium open bar package and upgraded their honeymoon suite to the penthouse. All in all, I was covering about $8,000 worth of upgrades she did even know about. Each vendor I call is shocked when I explain the situation. The cake baker actually says, after everything you've done for her. But I just tell them I need to cancel and they all understand. Some of them even refused to work with her if she tries to rebook. The venue calls her three days later to confirm cancellation. That's when my phone starts going off crazy. 47 missed calls in an hour. When I finally answer, she's hyperventilating. What did you do to my wedding? She screams so loud I have to hold the phone away from my ear. The venue wants $12,000 for a last minute Booking? The florist won't even return her calls. The photographer is booked. Caterer says they have no record of her event. I let her rant for a solid minute before I calmly explained that all those vendors were my connections, my accounts, my negotiations. You said you didn't want anything from me, remember? She starts about how the wedding is in 11 days and everything is ruined, and how could I do this to her? You literally told me not to come. I reminded her these were all my favors to call in, not yours. She tries to guilt trip me, saying I'm ruining the most important day of her life. Risa, you said good. When I told you I'd have to cancel everything, you hung up on me. She calls me a jealous bitch and says she'll never forgive me. That's fine. I tell her

My friend autumn asked me to hang out with her during her overnight shift at the pawn shop there had been three robberies at other shops in the area this month and an employee was killed at the last one. I got there at 9 as the last customer was leaving and autumn was locking the front door, explaining we'd only buzz in people who had items on them. The buzzer went off for the first time at 10:30 when autumn buzzed the man in. He walked up to the counter with this big smile, and he needed quick cash for a family emergency and had electronics to sell. But something felt off about how he kept looking around the shop instead of at us while he talked, memorizing where all the cameras were. While autumn examined his old laptop, the man walked around the shop, stopping at the case with the guns, asking if those were real. Autumn said yes, but they kept them locked, and he nodded, then asked about the jewelry case electronic section, like he was cataloging everything valuable. He came back to the counter and after a minute asked how much cash the shop kept on hand for buying items, when autumn looked up nervously and said it varied. He asked if we knew about Luna, the employee who died last week. The way he knew her name made my skin crawl because it hadn't been Released in the news, Autumn's hands started shaking, and she said, no, we didn't know her. He said that was good, because it would be traumatic to lose a friend that way, bleeding out behind the counter while the safe was being emptied. Neither of us had heard that detail, and autumn asked how he knew that. He smiled and said he paid attention to things. He asked if we were alone in the shop, and when autumn said the owner checked the cameras remotely, he looked directly at each camera and counted them out loud, then said, cameras didn't help Luna. My heart was pounding now as he walked to the back area where the guitars hung, running his hands along them, then to the tool section. Picking up a crowbar and feeling its weight, he brought it back to the counter and set it down, saying it was a nice one, good quality. Could probably open anything with it. He asked autumn if she'd ever been robbed before, and when she said no, he said, Luna probably said the same thing before that night. He leaned across the counter and asked if autumn knew what Luna's mistake was. We. We're both frozen, as he said she'd been too slow opening the safe, had fumbled the combination twice because her hands were shaking, and that made everything take longer than necessary. He said delays were dangerous for everyone involved. Adam's hand moved toward the silent alarm, but he grabbed Her wrist, not hard, but firm. And said Luna had tried that too, but the police took 12 minutes to arrive. He let go and stepped back, say, and he needed to make a withdrawal from the safe. All the cash and the good jewelry from the case. Autumn said she couldn't do that, and he said she could and would, because he'd asked nicely once already. He mentioned that Luna had said she couldn't open the safe either, but eventually she did. It just took some convincing.

So I gave him the 1950s housewife he wanted. I had been with Craig for three years when he completely ruined my promotion dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. Women today are the problem with everything, he said, twirling his pasta. They don't know how to be real women anymore. They're always trying to wear the pants, competing with men instead of serving them. My grandpa had it right. His woman stayed home, cooked meals and didn't talk back. My wine glass stopped halfway to my mouth. Craig, we are literally here to celebrate my promotion. That's exactly what I mean. You care more about your stupid job than making me happy. Back in the day, women knew their place and kept their man satisfied. I looked around the restaurant where we were supposed to be celebrating my success. So you want a traditional relationship like the actual 1950s? His eyes lit up. Finally, you get it? Yes. A real woman who acts like a woman should, the way god intended. Okay. Traditional it is. He reached over to grab my hand. See, I knew you would understand. Most women would get all feminist and defensive about this. The next morning, I showed up to breakfast in a full 1950s housewife outfit, complete with pearls and a puffy dress that covered my ankles. Goodbye. Morning, Mr Anderson, I said. Putting his coffee down, he laughed. Okay, the outfit is cute, but You don't have to call me that. Oh, but I do. In the 1950s, a proper lady always addresses her man respectfully. His smile started to fade that evening when he wanted to go to his friend's party. I shook my head, oh, no, Mister Anderson, I can't share a car with you. We're not married. People would think I'm a prostitute. What? That's insane. In the 1950s, unmarried couples needed chaperones. I will have to take the bus and meet you there. The bus. Just get in the car. That would make me a loose woman, Mister Anderson. He had to explain to everyone at the party why we arrived separately. At the party, his friend Kyle asked about my promotion. I turned to Craig. May I answer him? Mr Anderson's face went red. Just talk to him as you wish. I turned to Kyle. Mr Anderson doesn't believe women should work. I will be quitting my job soon to focus on cooking and cleaning like a real woman. My mother failed to teach me that my only value is serving a man. Kyle nearly choked on his beer. Dude, what the hell? She's being stupid, Craig muttered. No, Mister Anderson believes modern women are broken. We think we deserve Equality when we should be grateful men even put up with us. I sat quietly, hands folded, only speaking when Craig gave permission. His friends kept staring at him. The real entertainment started at his company picnic when his Boss's wife asked about my job. I smiled sweetly. Mister Anderson says careers make women forget how to be women. Would you like my potato salad recipe instead? It's the only thing I'm good for. I spent the entire event walking three steps behind Craig, staring at the ground, calling him Mr Anderson and asking his permission for everything. May I have a hot dog, Mr Anderson? Just take the damn hot dog. Is that a yes? I need you to say yes or no. His co workers started whispering. When someone asked why I kept calling him Mr Anderson, I explained happily. Craig says modern women destroyed society by thinking they're equal to men. He wanted a traditional 1950s relationship where I knew my place. His boss overheard Craig. Did you really say that? She's twisting my words, Craig growled. Oh, no. Mister Anderson was very clear. He said women should shut up, stay home and give men sex on demand. The boss's face went ice cold. HR. Will want to discuss this on Monday. Craig. By week 3, Craig was cracking. Can we please have sex? He asked. One night, I gasped to my girls, literally, Mr Anderson, good girls don't do that before marriage. What would Jesus think? We have been having sex for three years. That was the old me. The new traditional me saves herself for marriage. He punched a pillow. Then came his mother's birthday dinner at Craig's favorite steakhouse. When the waiter came, Over, I handed him my menu immediately. Mr Anderson will order for me. Ladies, don't talk to other men. Craig's mom's jaw dropped. Craig, what is going on? Your son wanted a traditional 1950s relationship? I explained. Looking down shyly, he says, modern women ruined every anything by having jobs and opinions. Craig, Michael Anderson. His mother's voice could have broken windows. You're trying to control this sweet, successful woman. Mom, she's doing this on purpose. May I speak, Mr Anderson, I asked sweetly. Stop calling me that. But you wanted to be the man of the house. Traditional men are called Mister by their women. His mother yelled at him through the entire dinner while I sat silently asking Craig for permission to eat each bite. On the drive home, he exploded. Fine, I was wrong. Please just go back to normal. I smoothed my dress carefully. Oh, Mister Anderson. A traditional woman never questions her man's first decision. It would not be proper for me to disagree with you. The vein in his forehead looked ready to pop as I smiled sweetly and walked exactly three steps behind him to his apartment door.

So I gave him the 1950s housewife he wanted. I had been with Craig for three years when he completely ruined my promotion dinner at this fancy Italian place downtown. Women today are the problem with everything, he said, twirling his pasta. They don't know how to be real women anymore. They're always trying to wear the pants, competing with men instead of serving them. My grandpa had it right. His woman stayed home, cooked meals and didn't talk back. My wine glass stopped halfway to my mouth. Craig, we are literally here to celebrate my promotion. That's exactly what I mean. You care more about your stupid job than making me happy. Back in the day, women knew their place and kept their man satisfied. I looked around the restaurant where we were supposed to be celebrating my success. So you want a traditional relationship like the actual 1950s? His eyes lit up. Finally, you get it? Yes. A real woman who acts like a woman should, the way god intended. Okay. Traditional it is. He reached over to grab my hand. See, I knew you would understand. Most women would get all feminist and defensive about this. The next morning, I showed up to breakfast in a full 1950s housewife outfit, complete with pearls and a puffy dress that covered my ankles. Good morning, Mr Anderson, I said. Putting his coffee down, he laughed. Okay, the outfit is cute, but You don't have to call me that. Oh, but I do. In the 1950s, a proper lady always addresses her man respectfully. His smile started to fade that evening when he wanted to go to his friend's party. I shook my head, oh, no, Mr Anderson, I can't share a car with you. We're not married. People would think I'm a prostitute. What? That's insane. In the 1950s, unmarried couples needed chaperones. I will have to take the bus and meet you there. Bus. Just get in the car. That would make me a loose woman, Mister Anderson. He had to explain to everyone at the party why we arrived separately. At the party, his friend Kyle asked about my promotion. I turned to Craig. May I answer him, Mister Anderson? Craig's face went red. Just talk to him as you wish. I turned to Kyle. Mister Anderson doesn't believe women should work. I will be quitting my job soon to focus on cooking and cleaning like a real woman. My mother failed to teach me that my only value is serving a man. Kyle nearly choked on his beer. Dude, what the hell? She's being stupid, Craig muttered. No, Mister Anderson believes modern women are broken. We think we deserve Equality when we should be grateful men even put up with us. I sat quietly, hands folded, only speaking when Craig gave permission. His friends kept staring at him. The real entertainment started at his company picnic when his Boss's wife asked about my job. I smiled sweetly. Mr Anderson says careers make women forget how to be women. Would you like my potato salad recipe instead? It's the only thing I'm good for. I spent the entire event walking three steps behind Craig, staring at the ground, calling him Mr Anderson and asking his permission for everything. May I have a hot dog, Mr Anderson? Just take the damn hot dog. Is that a yes? I need you to say yes or no. His co workers started whispering. When someone asked why I kept calling him Mr Anderson, I explained happily. Craig says modern women destroyed society by thinking they're equal to men. He wanted a traditional 1950s relationship where I knew my place. His boss.

I can't share a car with you. We're not married. People would think I'm a prostitute. What? That's insane. In the 19 50s, unmarried couples needed chaperones. I will have to take the bus and meet you there. The bus? Just get in the car. That would make me a loose woman, Mister Anderson. He had to explain to everyone at the party why we arrived separately. At the party, his friend Kyle asked about my promotion. I turned to Craig. May I answer him, Mister Anderson? Craig's face went red. Just talk to him. As you wish. I turned to Kyle. Mister Anderson doesn't believe women should work. I will be quitting my job soon to focus on cooking and cleaning like a real woman. My mother failed to teach me that my only value is serving a man. Kyle nearly choked on his beer. Dude, what the hell? She's being stupid. Craig muttered. No, Mister Anderson believes modern women are broken. We think we deserve Equality when we should be grateful men even put up with us. I sat quietly, hands folded, only speaking when Craig gave permission. His friends kept staring at him. The real entertainment started at his company picnic when His boss's wife asked about my job. I smiled sweetly. Mister Anderson says careers make women forget how to be women. Would you like my potato salad recipe instead? It's the only thing I'm good for. I spent the entire event walking three steps behind Craig, staring at the ground, calling him Mister Anderson, and asking his permission for everything. May I have a hot dog, Mister Anderson? Just take the damn hot dog. Is that a yes? I need you to say yes or no. His co workers started whispering. When someone asked why I kept calling him Mister Anderson, I explained happily. Craig says modern women destroyed society. By thinking they're equal to men. He wanted a traditional 1950s relationship where I knew my place.

Mister Anderson, good girls don't do that before marriage. What would Jesus think we, we have been having sex for three years. That was the old me. The new traditional me saves herself for marriage. He punched a pillow. Then came his mother's birthday dinner at Craig's favorite steakhouse. When the waiter came over, I handed him my menu immediately. Mr Anderson will order for me. Ladies, don't talk to other men. Craig's mom's jaw dropped. Craig, what is going on? Your son wanted a traditional 1950s relationship, I explained.

You're trying to control this sweet, successful woman. Mom, she's doing this on purpose. May I speak, Mr Anderson, I asked sweetly. Stop calling me that. But you wanted to be the man of the house. Traditional men are called Mister by their women. His mother yelled at him through the entire dinner while I sat silently asking Craig for permission to eat each bite on the Drive home, he exploded. Fine. I was wrong. Please just go back to normal. I smoothed my dress carefully. Oh, Mr Anderson. A traditional woman never questions her man's first decision. It would not be proper for me to disagree with you. The vein in his forehead looked ready to pop as I smiled sweetly and walked exactly three steps behind him to his apartment door.

Mine are all messed up. Sure. They're in my closet. Riley, why is there a huge coffee stain on those leggings I let you borrow two days ago? Oh, my god, that's horrible. I don't know how that could have happened. Sucks for you, though. Just don't make this longer than it has to be, okay? I'm sorry. It was an accident. I'm so sick of you borrowing my things and messing them up. Kylie, you're my big sister. This is part of the job description, honey. Kylie, can I use your laptop to play this game that all my friends are playing together? Go ahead. I love you. Um, Kylie, I kind of messed up. You'll see when you get home. What now? Riley? Why is my laptop not turning on? I was drinking water, and then I swear to god, I felt something push me in my back. It spilt all over the laptop. I'm so sorry, Kylie. I tried wiping it down and everything. Well, there's $900 down the drain. It's okay, Riley. You're the golden girl who can do no wrong. That's what mom would say, right? Are you mad? No, I'm just ecstatic. What do you think? Riley? Riley, what have you done to my makeup? Oh, yeah, I was going to tell you about that. I had a little accident. A little accident? You ruined everything! I'm sorry, Kylie. I didn't mean 2. One thing just Broke. And then everything else followed. You need to be taught a lesson, Riley. I've had enough. Mom, Riley just destroyed $500 worth of my makeup and ruined the bathroom sink in the process. How bad is it? What is wrong with you? Kylie, I'm genuinely interested to see how you're going to flip this onto me. She might be 15, but I wasn't doing things like this at her age. Why on earth would you spend that much money on makeup? That mess is fixable. But you wouldn't have been this angry if it wasn't so expensive. And for what? To paint your face? You know what? I'm not even going to engage in this. Kylie, why is your door locked? Because I'm out. And I don't want you to go in there and cause World War 3. That makeup thing was the last straw. Riley, you know I love you, but this is unacceptable. We're family. We have to share with each other. You're my big sister. I tried to do the right thing. From now on, if you want to use my things, you're going to have to pay me. Pay you with what money? I don't have a job. Figure it out. I'm telling Mommy. Of course you are. Kylie, why are you acting like this toward your little sister? I tried doing it the nice way, mom. It didn't work. Well, when you come back, your things are going to be packed in a suitcase. What? If you two can't live with each other, then it's way easier for you to move out rather than her. You're 19 now anyway. It's about time. I'm sorry, honey. This is the only way. No, it's not. You better lock your sweet Riley in a room or something, because it won't be pretty when I see that little brat.

I don't have this number saved. Who is this? Sorry, I should have introduced myself. I'm Daniela. I live in the apartment next to you. I'm Adam. I know. How did you get my number? Our landlord gave it to me, bruh. So can you keep the noise down? It's not me that's making the noise. Well, then who is it? My girlfriend, Crystal. Did something happen? Yeah, but it's none of your business. Well, I think I deserve to know, since she woke me up at seven in the morning on a Saturday. Fine. She asked me if I enjoyed our bedroom life. And what did you say? Obviously, I said yes. So why is she upset? She asked what I liked about it specifically, and I told her I liked everything. Oh, that makes sense. What? I'd be mad, too, if I got that response. Well, it's not my fault Crystal is extremely basic in the bedroom. Still, you could have answered it better. Okay, Daniela, how would you have answered it? I don't know. Yeah, well, I have to deal with her, so I'll talk to you later. Hey, Adam, what do you have in your fridge? Why? Just answer. A whole lot of ingredients. Can you cook? No. Crystal was supposed to make dinner, but she went out. So you're alone? Yeah. How about I come over for dinner? I don't know if Crystal would be okay with that. Well, You said she's not home. And you also can't cook. You wanna go to bed hungry tonight? I can cook for you. Why would you do that? My fridge is empty. Oh, so you want a free meal? I'd also like to get to know my neighbor better. I'd like to put a face to the name. That's true. Great. I'll be over in an hour. See you then. Daniela. Dinner was amazing, Adam. Thanks for having me over. Thanks for cooking. No problem. It's nice to put a face to the name. Yeah. If I'm being honest, I didn't expect you to look like that. Like what? Pretty. That's sweet, Adam, but you have a girlfriend. Hopefully not for long. Why do you say that? Crystal came home an hour after we had dinner last night. She ignored me and went straight to bed. That doesn't seem like a huge problem. The last time she acted like that, she was cheating on me. Wait, why are you still with her if she cheated? I'm honestly not sure. Daniela, I think you should leave her for someone who knows your value. Like who? Never mind. Talk to you later. Hey, Adam. Can you guys stop making so much noise? Sorry, Daniela. I can't stop her. She keeps yelling at me, calling me a cheater. Why does she think you're cheating? Somehow she could smell your perfume from yesterday. Is there anything I can do to help? No, she just left. Again? What if she really is cheating on you again? I don't wanna think about that. What if we could find proof if she is cheating? How? How about you come over to my place for dinner tonight? We can come up with a plan then. Okay? Sure. What time? 7. That works. Comment for part three?

I hate to tell you over text like this, but I'm scared to tell you in person. Wait, what? Why? You seem so happy, even though you're a bit ungrateful sometimes. Me and Gary are happy to keep you. Well, Gary gave his daughter my room and made me sleep in the office. And you just went along with it and didn't even say anything? You're 16 now. Honey, she's only nine. I thought you could handle it. Then all my stuff that was in my room, you threw out because there was no space. Honey, it was all things from years ago. It sounds to me like you need to grow up and let go of the past. I haven't even mentioned how your boyfriend Gary is always looking at me weird and trying to spend time alone with me. I don't know what his intentions are there. You're gross for thinking that. Live, Gary only has eyes for me. Plus, you're too old for him. Young. I meant young. Dad's house is bigger and I wouldn't have to sleep in an office. Mom, okay, this is ridiculous. I'm sorry that I don't have a mansion, but I've always tried my best for you. Live, I would starve myself so you could eat. Mom, what are you talking about? You've never had a job. You go from guy to guy and leech their money. And you've never been grateful for what I've Done for us. So go run to your daddy like the little girl you are. I replaced you with Gary's daughter. Anyway. Good for you. Bye. Mom. Live. It's been three weeks. Please come back. Mom, I'm happy at Dad's house. I can't live without you. I'm sorry for what I said to you. I was just angry because you were leaving. Has anything that made me want to move out been changed? Am I still going to have to sleep in an office? You're being so selfish right now. Can you just think of me for once? I need my daughter. And you need me, don't you? I don't know if I do anymore, mom. Ever since you left, I've been needing to drink to numb my pain. I've blacked out a few times. Oh, my gosh, mom, are you okay? I just need to see you live. You don't have to stay with me all the time anymore. Maybe just a couple days a week. Okay, I'll come over and we can discuss it. Dad, Mom wants to see me. I don't really wanna go, but I'm scared of what she would do to herself if I said no. You can't go alone, honey. Can you pick me up from school and take me? But don't come inside. She might flip out. Okay, I'm coming now. Honey, it's been one hour. What are you guys doing in there? Dad, she's acting crazy. I told her I can't move. Back in! And she started shouting, so I went to hide in the toilet, hoping she cools down. But now she's banging on the door and she's saying she won't let me leave with a baseball bat in her hand. And she's really drunk. Should I come inside? I don't want her to get even more angry. She doesn't know I bought you. Wait, never mind. This door sounds like it's going to break anytime soon. Come stop her, quick! Dad! Wait! I'm coming! No! Why did I just hear a scream?

Yesterday, my phone rang at 2:00am. It was the police. Ma'am, we have your six year old son, Tommy at the station. He walked here by himself, saying his mommy heard his baby sister. I shot out of bed. What? Tommy's in his room sleeping. And I don't have a baby sister. Ma'am, please come down to the station immediately. I ran to Tommy's room. Empty bed, front door wide open. At the police station, Tommy was wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The moment he saw me, he screamed, don't let her take me. She killed my sister. My heart stopped. The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away, too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room while Tommy sobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My Stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. Spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. Little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. This psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy's story never changed. Hours passed. The detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She. He sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She showed me the room she made all pink And pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us? But before I could answer,

Come on, it's just for a week or two. Fine, but you owe me. How much? Fries and milkshakes every day. Rizz App tells him to say, I thought I owe you my heart. I thought I owe you my heart. That was smooth. Anyways, I got you. Why is everyone staring at me in the hallway? Probably because you're dating the most eligible bachelor in school. Cut the ego trip. Did you tell people details? Just the usual we're madly in love stuff. You're kidding. Relax, it's believable. Someone just asked me when we had our first kiss. What did you say? I panicked and said sophomore year. Nice. That makes us high school sweethearts. Jake, this isn't a Netflix romcom. It could be. No. Alright, alright, Ava. Now what? Sarah just cornered me after practice. Oh boy. What did she say? She asked, what does Ava have that I don't? And you said, better taste. Oh my god. You didn't. I did. The look on her face was priceless. You're impossible. And you're stuck with me. Someone left a Note in my locker. A love letter? No. It said, Alex deserves someone better than you. Yikes. Gee, thanks for the sympathy. I'm just saying, it's probably Sarah. She's dramatic like that. Well, congrats. Your fake girlfriend now has a nemesis. So this is fun. My mom just asked, when is Jake coming over for dinner? She knows? Of course she knows. You couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you? Actually, I didn't say anything. Then how does she know? Moms have their ways. What did you tell her? That we're busy. Lame. I love your mom's cooking.

He had several, but his favorite was weird. He never took it out when it was raining. It was unbearable because I love going out. Why? Was he afraid of a little rain? No, he said the car was too powerful and the rear would slide out of nowhere. If your car slides when it's wet, maybe the real issue is the clown behind the wheel, not the horse. Haha that was good babe. What car was it? I don't remember very well, but the car was manual and the car was really low. Hard to get into. Ha ha. Manual? That's old car stuff. I think so too. He never let me drive it. The nickname was tomato because it was red and he said it sounded like the brand name. You should have been embarrassed by that name. Ha ha. Do you remember what the logo looked like? I remember it had something like P72. My ex said there were only 72 of those cars in the world. P72? Yeah, and I hated the noise. It sounded like a formula one car. It was super loud. His car was a D Tomasso P72? Yeah, that's exactly.

Your brother broke into my apartment, smashed my laptop, took my hard drive and handed it to the cops. He's 15. And because he thought you were hiding something, he was trying to protect me. He thought you were cheating. Maybe 15, but he planted spyware on my phone, cracked my messages, leaked private conversations to my boss. He thought you were lying to everyone. He just wanted the truth. The truth. The truth is I was working on a private whistleblower case. Everything he leaked, it wasn't cheating. It was evidence, sensitive data, confidential witnesses. He blew it all open. But you didn't tell me any of this. How are we supposed to know? You weren't supposed to know for your own safety. That's why I kept it quiet. And now, because your brother decided to play detective, a journalist who trusted me got doxxed. An entire case got compromised. But still, he's your family. We can't destroy him over a mistake. He destroyed me. I lost my clearance. I lost my team. I lost people's trust. He didn't mean for that to happen. Intent doesn't undo damage. If I did what he did, would anyone let it slide? You're saying he should go to prison? I'm saying someone should finally be held accountable. Because every time someone says he didn't mean to, I'm the one picking up the pieces again.

You know, like the people who've never been politely educated by a closed fist. Last weekend I watched a grown man buck at a Waffle House. Cook like buck. Like. Do you know how untouched by violence you have to be to buck at an armed line cook? That is not confidence, that's delusion. That's I've never had my head bounced off a urinal for talking spicy during golden tea energy. I guarantee you these are the people who correct grammar in an argument. Oh, you meant you're gonna catch these hands, not you're. There's an apostrophe. Yeah, cool spell concussion, you chode. Have you ever tried to finish a sentence mid nosebleed? Do you ever conjugated verbs while tasting pennies after blunt force trauma? I thought not. Respect isn't a virtue, it's muscle memory. And the people who don't have it have never been humbled by hands. Cause once you've been baptized by hands, you stop leaning into conversations the same way. That's right, sucker! They confuse being loud with being right, which is super annoying. They'll argue with retail workers and then leave Yelp reviews with adjectives like appalling. They'll use phrases like I demand an explanation! My favorite though. They always say it. Violence is never the answer. Which is adorable because violence isn't the answer, it's the lesson plan. And some motherfuckers skip class.

They were more concerned with the munchies. Like they'd see a monster like Zoinks, Scoobs, check it out, there's a vampire. Yeah, maybe he's got some Scooby snacks. And they had the dumbest ideas in the world. Watch that show as an adult. Only a stoner would have these stupid thoughts. They would be in a haunted castle in the middle of the night, pitch black dark. And hear a noise like sewing scoops. Did you hear that? Yeah. Like maybe someone's baking a cake. What are the odds someone's baking a cake in a haunted castle in the dark? Only a pothead would think like maybe they'll be cake. I told my mom at 6 years old. She got furious. She was like, you know what? Maybe they weren't high. Maybe that is the way the characters were created. I was like mom, let's be honest. Shaggy could talk to a dog. Like have you ever thought you might be high and you look at your dog and say, hey dog, I could really go for a pizza. If your Dog looks back and says, yeah, me too. Guess what? You're high.

So whether it's like, church or, like, the gym, and, you know, you be getting ready mad slow, you be taking, like, 10 minutes to put your left shoe on. Another thing. Do y'all ever procrastinate from doing something productive so hard that you'll do other productive things just to not do that one? Like, for instance, I'll have to do my homework, and I'll not wanna do it so bad that I'll just decide to clean my room. When I'm bored, I can find nothing to do. But when I have work to do, oh, there are thousands of things I could be doing right now. And I don't know about y'all, but the number one thing that made my room look like it was always dirty was the fact that I had 30 water bottles just sitting everywhere. It's imperative that I have water in my room because I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes with the driest throat ever. And taking that sip of water rejuvenates me. Thank you for your time.

Italy here in my country, only my country. That, by the way, needs no fucking introduction about the culinary culture. We normally use at least 30 kind of spices, but there are many more along those lines. I hear all they eat is fish in that cup, bro. So I guess Europe and Japan are pretty similar.

Meanwhile, you guys Democrats out here screaming, crying, singing Kumbaya in the streets like that's gonna fix inflation or secure energy deals. Spoiler alert, it won't. Like, when are y'all gonna realize that this man has actually done more for our freaking country in the last few months than the previous administration ever did in the four freaking years? He's not out here doing this for himself. He's bringing back money, investment, and respect to America. He is pulling us out of debt. He is trying to regain our strength as a country. And y'all want to sit out here and cry because this man is putting the power back into the people, to the working class, to the blue collar, to the damn backbone of this freaking nation! So grow up.

So I just gotta walk around target like I'm studying for a chemistry test. Okay. Or organic, pasture raised, regenerative, and make sure none of the shells are cracked. Every time I go to the supermarket alone, they're rearranging the aisles. The section I gotta get to is always under construction. What is the manager like?

Europe is a continent. They get things a lot later than the US. What kind of things? I think they got electricity, like, 10 years ago. Is this girl real? Electricity was first noticed in Greece in the years 600 before Christ. Greece, by the way, is a European country. No one in Europe speaks English. Um. Oh, yeah. London would be the only country where you could go and I guess, speak English. London is a city, but it's different. It's. It's British. They won't understand American at all, as far as I'm concerned. I guess they would really love not to be able to understand the single word you're saying. I hear they don't have spices besides salt there, so I'm definitely bringing some spices when I go. Italy here in my country, only my country. That, by the way, needs no fucking introduction. About the culinary culture. We normally use at least 30 kind of spices, but there are many more along those lines. I hear all they eat is fish. So I guess Europe and Japan are pretty similar. But, I mean, you all know this. We all went to school. Guess not. But I think in Europe, everyone is homeschooled on the fjords, so maybe I should start teaching them some stuff about, like, the rest of the world. Yes, please. Oh, my god.

How many people just blamed a woman for eating an apple? Let me show you what my dad showed me. These are the verses where god told Adam he could eat of any tree in the garden except for this one particular tree. Then god changes the subject completely and starts talking about making Adam a partner to help him out. So now not only is Adam the steward over all the animals, but now he's got another human he's supposed to be training, too. And he did not train Eve like he was supposed to. Because when the serpent came to tempt Eve, she said, you can't eat or touch the tree. Ain't nobody said you couldn't touch it, just couldn't eat from it. It was right then the serpent knew he had Eve. Oh, and it gets worse. When god confronted Adam about it, Adam tried to blame it on god and say, it's the woman that you gave me that made all this happen. And I'm no god, but as a parent, if my kid pulled that stunt to me, it would be on my Donkey Kong. And it gets worse. Knowing better, hearing the commandment from god himself, Adam still ate. So the first sin was not a woman eating an apple. It was a man not training his people.

So in the overhead bin, like, in one of my last flights, there was, like, this big metal object thing. It's like, it had wires all over it, and it was ticking.

It wasn't there. I looked quite in depth, I couldn't find it. He was asleep in the bed, and his wife was reading a book in the corner, and I wasn't about to ask her where her husband's sweener was. So my best friend Nicole was also in school with me. So I went and got her, and I was like, surely between the two of us, we can find it. But we didn't. So I had to go get my nursing instructor, Darlene Street, again, and tell her that I couldn't find this man's swiner. And she said, Paige, I promise it's there. And I was like, I promise you it's not. Now, his scrotal area was rather large, probably like this, like cantaloupe. Maybe bigger. I probably bigger. I don't know. I don't eat a lot of melons. Anyways, uh, she walked in and she took her hands like this, and she just pushed down and it just popped out. Just this little tiny. Just. Just popped right up. So I put the catheter in, and then I made something called a scrot sling. It's like a hammock that I made for between his legs. And then I took his and I. I had to pick him up and I put them on that so that they could drain, cause they had a lot of Fluid in them cause he was sick.

And although I get exhausted from day to day, I know my husband needs that for me. And I don't ever want to miss an opportunity going to Walmart with him, even if it's just a Walmart, cause one day I'm gonna miss that. You know, it's about communication and listening. About what? What the other person needs from you. And he needed me yesterday, and I had to give myself to him. That's my marriage for you. Let that sink in.

I don't go to any restaurant, hotel, nothing that is below four stars. I'm bougie. I do not play that. So I took it to the dry cleaners. She. Yeah, he said, Okay, when do you want it ready by?

What the hell is going on? That at the dry clean? Because if I would have known that I was giving you $10 for my shit to still stink, I wanna took this shit to The wet cleaners. I left the jacket in there for about a week and a half. Does the clean wear off? Does it expire? Bitch, it stink. It stinks. It stinks as if I never took it. Oh my god.

The biggest problem with millennial parents is the fact that they don't know how to tell these little motherfuckers no. You know, when I was growing up, I heard things like, want one hand and shit the other and see which one fills up first. Or the age old, if I wanted to do multiple things in a week, and I know y'all heard it too, my parents would look at me and go, pick one, cause you ain't doing them both. And I had to learn to make good decisions and understand that I'm gonna be disappointed that I can't do both, but I'm gonna find joy in the one thing I can do and I'm gonna get the fuck over it. Nowadays, though, you got these kids telling their parents what they're gonna do after school, what's gonna happen on the weekends, what foods gonna be in the house, what they're gonna have in their bedroom, how the house is ran. Then these parents are tired of shit because they're running their self into the ground. Either working to make sure they can afford everything, or taking their kid places or doing shit for them. Because they don't teach them how to handle shit on their own. They don't teach them how to handle disappointment, so they're always unhappy. So you gotta do more shit to keep them happy instead of just parenting. Teaching a kid how to handle Disappointment. How to make good decisions, how to deal with different decisions. And do what you wanna do here, but give up something you might wanna do over there. And learn to live with it. Parenting ain't hard. Y'all millennial parents made it fucking harder cause you let your kids run the house. That's the difference.

I don't know if she forgot, but she didn't have a lot of things before I moved in. So I took everything that was mine. The bed, the bed frame, the dressers, my clothes, clothes that I gave her, clothes that I let her borrow, the nightstand, the TV, the TV stand, the dishes, the utensils, toast, microwave, food in the fridge, mugs, couches, the coffee table, the kitchen table, the kitchen chairs, the toilet seat, shower curtain, the shower head, the washer, the dryer, the trash can. And took the pictures out of the picture frame. So by the time my friends and family helped me pack up, the place looked like it was ready for new tenants. Waited a few days for her to get back from her trip. Then I messaged her, saying, hey, I heard that you might need a couch. I got one if you wanna buy it for me. I regret nothing.

It all started when Sammy randomly spawned a taco Lucky block and spawned Infinite Tim Cheeses and Taco Tuesday officially started. And with it bring the new taco event where you had to collect three brain rots for the new Taco Rita Bisicleta. And I thought it was going to be easy because there was 1 million of them available, but I was absolutely wrong. So I did the Feed Sammy Tacos event like usual, trying to get the rocks for the new taco Rita Bicicleta. And I was hoping for something good, but like always I get this absolute trash brain rot every single damn time. But finally I got the first brain rot I needed, the cappy taco. My luck would only keep getting worse from this point as I literally got the tea Taco every single flipping time. To make things even worse, the Feed Sammy event wouldn't even work anymore so I was forced to leave and rejoin, wasting a lot of time. But luckily Sammy did the snap event which activated literally every single event in the game. But that didn't change the fact my luck was probably the worst out of anyone in the entire event, as I literally could not get anything else other than the tea be Taco. I'm pretty sure that the game literally hates me because tell me, why did I get a rainbow TP Taco that got every single trait in The damn game. And as my luck got worse, the amount of brain rots left went down quickly and it sold out and I got absolutely nothing. What did you guys think about today's admin abuse? Let me know in the comments if you want a secret like follow and comment your user.

Like, bro, what? For those of y'all scratching your heads like huh? What's 7 7 7 supposed to mean? Let me catch you up real quick. Okay, so 7 7 7 sounds innocent, right? Like maybe a lucky number? Vegas vibes? No? Nope. It's straight up foul, man. There's this rabbit hole of filters titled 7 7 7 filter blah blah, and when you click on them, you think it's gonna be a cute little sparkle or dog ears filter. Nah, it turns into something your grandma would faint over. Here's the kicker though. Some dude, I swear, just keeps making viral videos telling folks, yo, if you type 7 7 7 you'll get kicked off TikTok instantly and folks believe it. So guess what? I tried it. I type 7 7 7 in my own comment section. I typed it in the search. TikTok. Didn't even flinch. I'm still here, breathing, scrolling, questioning my life choices. And if you saw that OG video. Bro, why are we still feeding this dude views? He's been doing this clout chasing conspiracy TikTok thing since like 2020. You know who I'm talking about. Name starts with K, yellow hair, glasses, make some weird song nobody remembers. Dudes out here pushing fake news like it's Black Friday deals. So yeah, if you tried It. And nothing happened. Welcome to the club. We alive? We vibing. Anyway, if anything new pops off with this 7 7 7 cult code, you know I got you. Drop a comment if you want to see more dumb TikTok myths get roasted. Hit that follow so we can laugh at fake drama together. All right, I'm out. Stay safe and don't trust anyone with yellow hair and a ukulele. Peace.

People who notice when your energy shifts, even just a little. Like you don't have to say anything, you don't have to explain, and somehow they just know. They'll check in with the quiet, are you okay? Or just sit with you so you don't feel alone. It's not about grand gestures. It's about the way they care. In silence. And sometimes that's all you really need. Just someone who notices.

I'm a 37 year old woman and I know what you're thinking when you hear that my 14 year old son takes a shower with me. Right? Well, I have a good reason for that. We share the same bathroom and bedroom. At first I hesitated to admit this online because of the judges looks and comments that I would receive from strangers. But here it goes. It all started three years ago when my husband suddenly left us without any explanation. It was a total shock. We had been married for more than 15 years and he seemed happy. Until one day he packed his bags and disappeared. All he said to us was, I'm going to buy milk at the gas station, I'll be right back. He never came back. The kids were devastated, especially my youngest son, Max. He clung to me more than ever, looking for comfort wherever he could find it. At night, Max would come into my room, trembling with cold, asking for a warm blanket. As much as I wanted to send him back to his own room, I couldn't stand seeing him so vulnerable. So gradually, Max got closer to my side and finally ended up sleeping next to me, sometimes even snuggling up to me. Over time, I began to notice that Max did not move away from my side during The day, either whether it was showering or brushing his teeth, Max was always there, watching closely. I tried to ignore him, hoping he would get over that phase like most teenage behaviours. However, as the days became weeks and then months, I realised that this was not going to disappear soon. One night, while I was showering, Max asked if he could join me. I asked him why, and he said that all the boys at school say that I have a level 9 gas. I don't know what that means, but at first I was surprised. I doubted without being sure if it was appropriate or healthy. But seeing him so small and fragile, I knew deep down that I couldn't say no. And so our new ritual began. Everything was going well. Normal showers between mother and son. Until I dropped the soap. And now you can check if there's a second part by pressing share. And more.

Is this some sort of joke? I asked when the officer said those strange words. Instead of asking for license and registration, the cop handed back my license that I'd already pulled out. His face had changed from stern authority to something softer and sadder. I just got radioed in about what happened. Terribly sorry for your loss, sir. Before I could ask what loss? He was already jogging back to his patrol car. He turned on his lights again, but this time pulled in front of me and block traffic so I could merge left immediately. Other cars moved aside as he created a clear path for me to speed ahead. I sat there frozen for a moment before pressing the gas. My hands were trembling on the steering wheel as I tried to process what just happened. The cop knew something I didn't. Something bad enough that he'd let me go without even a warning about my speed. I fumbled for my phone while keeping one eye on the road. I just landed at LAX an hour ago after a three day business trip to see Seattle. My wife Carly hadn't answered when I called from baggage claim, but that wasn't unusual. She often had her phone on silent while teaching her kindergarten class. I called her again. Straight to voicemail. I tried our home phone. Nothing. My chest started Feeling tight as I scrolled to her sister's number. Voicemail. Her mom. Voicemail. My mom. No answer. The highway stretched ahead of me, but I wasn't really seeing it anymore. My mind was racing through possibilities. Car accident, house fire, something at her school. Each scenario worse than the last. The cop had said lost. That word kept echoing in my head. Finally, I called my brother Harvey. It rang four times before his wife, Paulina, answered. She was crying so hard, I could barely understand her. How can she do this? I don't understand why she would do this. Paulina kept repeating between sobs, what happened? Where's Carly? Is she okay? I was practically shouting into the phone. Paulina just cried harder. I heard Harvey's voice in the background telling her to give him the phone. There shuffling and muffled voices before the line went dead. I called back three times, but no one answered. I was doing 90 now, weaving between cars. Other drivers honked, but I didn't care. Something had happened to my wife, and no one would tell me what. The exit was coming up, and I took it without signaling. I knew that's where they take her. It was the closest trauma center to her school. The hospital parking lot was a maze, but I abandoned my car in the first spot I saw. Legal or not, I didn't care. I ran through the sliding doors into the emergency room lobby. The smell of disinfectant, And fear hit me immediately. I'm looking for my wife, Carly Munos. She was brought here. I didn't even know when or why. The nurse at the desk typed something into her computer. When she looked back up at me, her eyes were watery. She knew who I was before I'd even given my name. The security guard will escort you. Her voice was barely a whisper. A large man in a blue uniform appeared and gestured for me to follow. We walked through endless hallways, past rooms full of beeping machines and worried families. My legs felt like they might give out, but I kept moving. The guard didn't say a word, just kept glancing at me with that same sad look everyone seemed to have. We took an elevator to the third floor pediatric I C U. The sign said, why were we in pediatrics if Carly was hurt? My brain couldn't make sense of it. The guard LED me down another hallway, where I could hear crying. Multiple people sobbing behind a closed door. I recognized voices as we got closer. Harvey. Paulina. Carly.

Like for real? A few days ago I tried this new feature they dropped where TikTok literally picks a song for your photo automatically. Sounds kind of cute, right? So I'm like, okay, let me just try it. I hit that little plus sign at the bottom, snapped a quick selfie, smiling and chill. No big deal. Then TikTok picks a song for me and it's Adele's someone like you. I was like, wait, what? I literally just woke up, was feeling cute, and TikTok's out here making it seem like I'm going through a breakup or something. So of course I had to try again. This time I took a pic of my cat just sleeping, all peaceful and cozy. Guess what song TikTok gave me? Megan, thee Stallion. Savage. Now my cat's out here being a whole bad bitch. Like what's going on TikTok? My friend tried it too. She took a pic of her breakfast, some toast and eggs, all cute and simple, and TikTok gave her unholy. At this point I'm seriously wondering if this app has psychic powers. It's not just matching songs to photos, it's like reading right through your soul. Now every morning I'm like, oh okay, what moods TikTok gonna give me today? I snap a pic and wait for the app to tell me how I'm feeling with a song. Y'all gotta try this. Take any pic, let TikTok pick your vibe. Then come back and tell me what song it gave you. Because honestly, I need to know if I'm the only one getting mind read by TikTok

I always had this weird feeling about my Uncle Pete. Like, everyone in my family absolutely loved the guy. He was the fun uncle. You know, the one who'd show up to family barbecues with his loud laugh and those expensive gifts that made all us kids go crazy. He take us out for burgers, let us play games on his phone for hours. And somehow he always knew all the latest slang before we did. But something about Pete just felt off to me. Maybe it was how he'd always squeeze into your personal space when he talked to you, standing way too close. Or how he always wanted to be alone with one of us kids, saying stuff like, let the grown UPS talk and pulling us into another room. My parents thought it was sweet that he wanted to spend time with us. I was 16 when my little cousin Emily started acting different. Emily was always this bubbly kid who asked a million questions and made everyone laugh with her silly jokes. But suddenly she got quiet. Like, really quiet. She stopped joking around completely. Stopped asking her usual why this and why that questions. When I'd ask her what was wrong, she just shrug and say she was tired. That wasn't Emily at all. One Saturday, I was helping my dad clean out the garage. We were sorting through old tools and junk when I saw this spare Key hanging on a little hook. It had a label that said Pete in my dad's handwriting. That made zero sense to me. Pete didn't live with us. He had his own apartment across town. Why would he need a key to our house? When I asked my dad about it, he just chuckled and said, Pete probably made a copy years ago when they used to share tools back and forth. You know how your uncle is, always borrowing something dad said. But something about that explanation felt wrong. Pete hadn't borrowed tools in years. That night I couldn't sleep. Something about that key kept bugging me. Why would Pete still need access to our house? Why was the key hanging in the garage where everyone could see it? The more I thought about it, the weirder it seemed. The next day I decided to fake being sick and stay home from school. I told my mom I had a headache and she believed me. After everyone left for work and school, I just waited. I had this gut feeling that something was going to happen. Around two forty five PM, right before Emily usually walked home from school and stopped by our house to wait for her mom to pick her up, I heard the garage door open, but nobody was supposed to be home. I looked out the window and saw Pete's blue Honda pulling into our driveway. My heart started pounding. Pete walked straight into the Garage like he owned the place. Grab that key and let himself into the house through the side door. He didn't even knock or call out to see if anyone was home. He just walked right in. I followed him from upstairs, trying to be as quiet as possible. He went straight to the downstairs guest room where Emily usually waited. When she came over, Pete looked around. Then

But her face immediately dropped when she realised that we tricked her. My sister in law, Maya, has always been competitive with me, since the day I married her brother Jake. She couldn't handle that someone else was getting attention and what she considered her family. When Jake and I got engaged, I tried to announce her own engagement at our party. When we bought our first house, she suddenly started house hunting, too. So when we both ended up pregnant at the same time, I knew the competition was about to get intense. Maya was due just two weeks before me, and from the moment we announced, she became absolutely obsessed with finding out our baby name choice. At first, it started innocently enough. She'd casually ask during family dinners, have you guys thought about names yet? When we'd de flesh, she'd push harder, come on, just give me a hint. But then it escalated. Maya started showing up at our house unannounced, trying to peek at any baby books we had lying around. She'd walk through our nursery and comment on everything, clearly fishing for clues. She even asked my mother in law to pressure us into sharing our choice. The breaking point came when I caught her literally going through our mail. When she thought we weren't looking. She was flipping through baby magazines and packages, desperately searching for Any evidence of our name decision? My husband thought I was being paranoid when I told him I suspected Maya wanted to steal our name and use it first. She wouldn't do that, he said. But I knew better. This was exactly the kind of petty move Maya would pull. That's when I decided to set a trap. I created bacon interest boards filled with names I'd never actually consider using. I strategically left a notebook open on our kitchen counter with final decision written in big letters next to the name Aurora Rose. And Maya came over for dinner. I even coordinated with my mom to call me while Maya was within earshot, having a completely fake conversation about how Aurora fits so perfectly with your family naming tradition. And I'm so excited you finally decided. Maya took the bait completely. Over the next few weeks, she started casually bringing up the name Aurora in random conversations, testing how we'd react.

The whole family flooded the comments with congratulations, but I noticed Maya kept checking to see if I'd responded. She was clearly waiting for my reaction.

Hey, what kind of kid says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just three and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve.

So my brother Jake got married, like, three weeks ago, and the whole thing was basically a slap in the face. His wife Megan decided nobody under 21 could come because they were serving alcohol and didn't want any minors getting drunk. I was 19 at the time, which apparently made me some kind of liability. The excuse was complete bullshit, and everyone knew it. I don't even drink that much. Maybe a beer here and there with friends, but I'm not some alcoholic teenager who's gonna embarrass their precious wedding. But whatever. That's what they decided, and my parents just went along with it, like always. I asked them to reconsider a few times because, honestly, it hurt. Jake and I used to be close growing up. We shared a room until I was 14, played video games together, the whole thing. But ever since he started dating Megan two years ago, she's basically been calling all the shots. She thinks she's better than everyone because her dad owns some car dealership and she went to private school. After they kept saying no, I just stopped caring.

My brother texted, stay away from us. I replied, done. Then I withdrew my name as guarantor for their new house mortgage. I'm the family's designated adult, the one who gets late night calls for rides, the one who co signs things. My brother Robert is 29, charming, lives on impulse. His fiance, Bethany is intense, obsessed with social media. I never warmed to Bethany. She had this way of complimenting that felt like a slap. It's amazing that you're so stable and practical. Her smile never reached her eyes. Three months ago, they found their dream house in a neighborhood they couldn't afford. Their income wasn't enough for the mortgage. Robert asked me to be the guarantor, a massive 30 year financial risk. I had a lawyer draft a simple agreement with two key clauses. If they defaulted, I could take over their equity for what I paid and my guarantee was contingent on mutual respect and good faith. Any defamation would be grounds for immediate withdrawal. Robert barely glanced at. We're brothers. Good faith is a given. We signed it in front of a notary. At a family barbecue last weekend, Bethany came over, maybe tipsy, stood too close. You're always so serious. You should try to have some fun. It made me uncomfortable so I walked away. Two days later, my phone exploded with a text from Robert. Bethany had confessed I've been making her uncomfortable for Months. She claimed I cornered her, whispered she was too good for him, that she should be with a real man who could provide. The accusations were so specific, so venomous. This wasn't a misunderstanding. This was targeted character assassination. I tried calling Robert. No answer. Then the final message. I can't believe you do this to us. Bethany is a wreck. Just stay away from us. After 29 years together, my brother was gone. A strange calm settled over me. I texted back, done. My next call was to the mortgage advisor. Due to a significant personal conflict, I am formally withdrawing as guarantor. Sir, this will almost certainly lead to denial of their entire mortgage application. I am aware of the consequences. Three days later, frantic, banging on my door at ten PM Robert looked like he hadn't slept in days. What did you do? The loan is denied. You torpedoed the whole thing. You told me to stay away. I'm staying away from your finances, too. That was personal stuff. Bethany was upset. You don't ruin someone's future over a fight. A fight is arguing about who helps dad clean gutters. This, it was character assassination. And you believed her instantly? Without question. His phone buzzed. Bethany's voice, is he fixing it? Make him fix it. You have to call the bank, Robert demanded. Tell them it was a mistake. No, I'm not a light switch you can flick on and off. You don't get to treat Me like a monster in a bank. In the same week, the family pressure campaign started. Immediately, mom called. Families work through things. But Bethany launched a smear campaign, spinning stories about my growing jealousy and erratic behavior. Then a certified letter arrived from their lawyer demanding I reinstate.

When I asked what allowance, his face went white. For four months, I've been grinding three jobs, tutoring high school kids, weekend event staffing and bar shifts until 2:00am, classes until three PM, then straight to tutoring until six PM, quick dinner of instant noodles, then bar work until closing. I get home at 3:00am, study until 5, sleep for two hours, repeat, surviving on ramen packets and day old bread. When textbooks cost $400 each, I photocopy pages at the library. My friends go out Thursday nights while I'm serving drinks to businessmen who tip in singles. My bank account never goes above $200. Every dollar is calculated, $50 for groceries, $30 for laundry. I wear the same three shirts and my shoes have holes I cover with duct tape. Meanwhile, my sister Mariah floods Instagram from Paris. Designer coffee at trendy cafes, weekend trips to Monaco, new Dior dresses with captions like, mom always knows exactly what I need. Hashtag blessed, hashtag fashion life. When I begged mom for even $200 for groceries, she sighed heavily. Money is tight. Your father's practice is struggling. Paying your tuition is already stretching us. I worked harder, picked up extra shifts, skipped meals to save money. Last Friday, everything changed. I was carrying cocktails when the room started spinning. I remember reaching for the bar to steady myself, then nothing. I woke up in a hospital bed with an IV. The Doctor was stern. You collapsed from exhaustion and malnutrition. Your blood sugar was dangerously low. My bar manager visited, looking guilty, even working doubles every weekend. The rest of the month off. That meant losing $1,200 in income I desperately needed. My friend visited with groceries and made me spaghetti. While eating the first real meal I had in weeks, he said something that shattered my world. Your dad's a surgeon with a luxury car. You went to private school. How is your sister affording Paris? If money's so tight, you're working yourself into the hospital. That night, I called Mariah directly. Just checking in. How's Paris? Amazing. Mom just sent me the cutest Chanel bag for my birthday next month. My stomach dropped. How are you managing financially? Paris must be expensive. Oh, I don't worry about that. Mom transfers me about $3,000 a month plus extra whenever I need something special. $3,000 a month plus extras. While I was told there wasn't a single dollar to spare.

Then he called me desperate when he found out I had already found someone better to accompany me. My sister Kira was always the golden child. I was the accident that came 11 months later. My mother kept my hospital bracelet in a drawer labeled oops until I could read it myself at age six. Favoritism was constant. Kira got new clothes every season while I wore her hand me downs. Christmas, when I turned 8, I watched her unwrap the American Girl doll I begged Santa for. My gift was a dollar store knock off with the $1 99 cent sticker still on it. When I started crying, my father said, Selena, you're too old for tears. Kira is more sensitive than you. That was the moment I Learned I had to hide my emotions to avoid disappointing them further. Middle school was worse. At my 8th grade graduation, I won three academic awards while Kira sat in the audience getting seas during the car ride home. Instead of celebrating my achievements, my parents spent the entire time discussing how Kira must feel seeing me on stage so much. My mother said, Selena, maybe next time don't look so excited when they call your name. Think about your sister's feelings. In high school, I pulled straight A's while Kira barely passed. And report cards came home, they Pinned hers to the fridge and put mine in a drawer. The day I got accepted to Northwestern with a full scholarship, I found my parents comforting Kira, who just been fired from her clothing store job for showing up late. My mother looked at my acceptance letter and said, Selena, this really isn't the time. Can't you see your sister is upset? They spent an hour consoling her for losing a minimum wage job while completely ignoring my full scholarship that would save them $200,000. That night, my Aunt Sandra told me something that changed everything. Selena, you were never an accident. Your parents did fertility treatments to give Kira a sibling. But when you turned out smarter than her, they didn't know how to handle it. Everything clicked into place. The constant comparisons, the downplaying of my achievements, the way they seemed annoyed when I succeeded. College became my escape. I met Matt there, someone who valued my intelligence instead of feeling threatened by it. For the first time, I experienced what it felt like to be someone's first choice. When he proposed during our senior year, I cried from relief as much as joy. Someone finally chose me first and meant it. Three weeks before my wedding, my father called Lena. Kira scheduled her housewarming party for the same day as your wedding. Your mother and I think we should support her instead. You'll have Matt's family there. My heart shattered, dad, she's known my wedding date. For eight months. We'll try to stop by the reception if we can. When I told Matt's father, Jim, what happened, his eyes filled with tears. Selena, it would be the honor of my life to walk you down that aisle. His voice cracked with emotion. I've watched you for four years and you're already the daughter I never had. Wedding day arrived. Jim was waiting at the church doors in his best navy suit.

When I inherited my adoptive father's fortune, my biological father showed up. My biological parents, Brad and Nina, gave me away to another family when I was 8, not because they couldn't support me, but because I had ruined their plans. I still remember that last night it was raining and I hid under the kitchen table with my broken teddy bear while my mother screamed. You promised you would take care of this, Brad. I can't take, take it anymore, she yelled. I already spoke to the Baptist camp. They know a couple who wants to adopt, he replied like he was talking about giving away a dog. The next morning, Laura and Charles appeared and took me away. My parents didn't pack my things. I left with clothes on my back and an old toy. I thought everyone grew up afraid of their mother. I didn't have a place at the dinner table. When I showed her a drawing from school, she threw it in the trash. Once I heard my parents arguing, she was yelling, you promised me, you said if it was a girl we'd keep her. He replied, but it's too late now. No one wants a 7 year old boy. They were talking about me. My father only spoke to give orders. Wash the car, sweep the yard, clean my sister's bathroom. One day I saw new clothes on My sister's bed, dresses, pants, use with lights, nothing for me. When I asked if there was anything for me, she said, you already have something to wear. I grabbed Scissors and cut everything, every dress, every new garment. My blood was boiling, my hands shaking. It wasn't hatred. It was pure desperation. My mother burst into the room screaming and shoved me against the wall. You are a miss fake, a damn mistake, she screamed, pushing me against the wall. Later that night, my father came home. Nathan, tomorrow you're going to live with other people, he said with no emotion. Laura and Charles gave me what no one had tried to give me, security. Charles sold tools door to door. Then they started their own business. I, I helped however I could. The garage became a shop, then a warehouse, then a distribution center. At 21, I graduated with a business degree. Charles cried like a baby. Two years later, they went away for a weekend. An out of control truck hit them on a blind curve. It was instantaneous. They left me everything, the house, investments, the entire company. I grew the business, opened branches, hired over 100 employees. Last night security called me. There's a man here, says his name is Brad, says he's your father. When I went to the lobby, there he was, flumped, shoulders, unkempt beard, cheap clothes. Behind him were two exhausted women and four small children. Nathan, my son, he said, He had never called me that. Your mother left, ran off with another man. These are my daughters. They came back home with two kids each, no husbands, nothing. One of the children looked at me and asked quietly, are you Uncle Nathan? I had never been an uncle to anyone. You have so much now, Brad continued. We just need help until we get back on our feet. Then he said something that froze me. I want you to do for them what Charles and Laura did for you.

Oh my god. Oh my god. Please. Uh, uh. This pedophile committed a crime so disturbing that a petition was created that asked the government to publicly hang him. And the petition gathered thousands of signatures. This is 33 year old Benjamin Taylor from West Virginia. And in 2016, he would commit one of the most sickening crimes I've ever read about. Back in 2016, Benjamin was living with his girlfriend, a woman named Amanda Adkins. At the time, Amanda had recently given birth only nine months ago to her baby daughter Emily. Emily was a beautiful young girl. And I wanna warn you all right now, the details that we're about to discuss are some of the most disturbing I've ever covered. So in October of 2,016, Benjamin had only been living with his girlfriend Amanda for about a month. And on the morning of Emily's death at around 4:00am, Amanda woke up and went downstairs to search for her baby. When she went downstairs, she saw Benjamin Taylor with his pants unzipped sitting in the dark. Amanda.

What the fuck? Judge Kevin Mullins was shot and killed by the town sheriff in front of the camera in his office. He once turned the prison in Lectola County into a brothel to satisfy his and his nauseating friends filthy fantasies. Bollins and his friends organized such parties in the county prison and other buildings in town, selecting the female prisoners they wanted. As a reward for these women, he will shorten their sentences or alleviate any punishment they face. If these women are unwilling to participate or refuse, he will threaten them, either sentencing them to the maximum sentence or kicking them to their most painful place. On March 12th, Sheriff Marshall was invited to a party and discovered that his wife and daughter were also involved. His wife was beaten by Mullins for disobedience and Sheriff Marshall angrily questioned Mullins before taking his wife and daughter home. Two days later, his daughter ended her life due to her inability to accept reality. Furious, Marshall rushed into Mullins's office, pulled out his weapon, and fired three shots in a row. He died before the police arrived. Now Marshall is accused of first degree murder. He may never see his family again. Do you think he is a hero or a criminal?

They walked through the doors just before closing time Monday night. They're like, hey, you're open. Great. At the Buffalo Wild Wings on Montgomery and Wyoming. She has a real nice smile on her face. The woman even raised her hands when staff announced they were still open. They sit down, and it's a family. It's a mother, a guy, and a child. Management tells us they were the only three paying customers left in the restaurant, or so they thought. They walk into the restaurant, the friend, the waitress. They order over $100 worth of food. Two large orders of wings, a sampler plate, dessert, drinks to go, and more. They leave $150 on the table. The other server sees this and thinks, well, that family is paying for the meal. My friends about to get a really large tip. This is really good. Just one minute to realize that money was fake. But they say what's even more concerning, they're using their child as a ruse.

What the fuck? Judge Kevin Mullins was shot and killed by the town sheriff in front of the camera in his office. He once turned the prison in Lectola County into a brothel to satisfy his and his nauseating friends filthy fantasies. Bollins and his friends organized such parties in the county prison and other buildings in town, selecting the female prisoners they wanted. As a reward for these women, he will shorten their sentences or alleviate any punishment they face. If these women are unwilling to participate or refuse, he will threaten them, either sentencing them to the maximum sentence or kicking them to their most painful place. On March 12th, Sheriff Marshall was invited to a party and discovered that his wife and daughter were also involved. His wife was beaten by Mullins for disobedience and Sheriff Marshall angrily questioned Mullins before taking his wife and daughter home. Two days later, his daughter ended her life due to her inability to accept reality. Furious, Marshall rushed into Mullins's office, pulled out his weapon, and fired three shots in a row. He died before the police arrived. Now Marshall is accused of first degree murder. He may never see his family again. Do you think he is a hero or a criminal?

On March 9, 2013, in Springfield, New York, a 16 year old boy named Dylan Shoemaker was asked to take care of his girlfriend's two young sons while she was working at a restaurant. His girlfriend, Ashley Smith, finished her shift, and when she returned home, she found her 23 month old son, Austin Smith, completely lifeless on the floor. Dylan was immediately arrested by the police for killing Austin, and when the doctor examined Austin's body, it was revealed that the cause of death was a severe brain injury resulting from the back and forth movement of his head caused by blows. Dylan at the trial kept pleading to the judge that he did not mean to hurt Austin and tearfully apologized, expressing his love for Austin and regret for what had happened. But that quickly went out the window as Dylan later admitted to hitting the child multiple times and eventually placing a pillow over the child's head and repeatedly punching him. And why did he commit such a vile crime? According to Dylan, Austin was crying and was disturbing his baby brother, so he placed the pillow on Austin's head and punched it to stop the crying.

His face swollen and bruised. Daytona Beach police say Frolander was beaten by the father of the victim. I attacked him viciously and I didn't stop. The only time my pause was to go to the kitchen and retrieve a butcher knife cause I was going to kill him. My son stepped in front of me and saved his life. He just looked at me and said, sir, and shook his head and said no. I just put the knife down. I just wouldn't traumatize him any more than he already was. Police say Jason won't face any charges for the beating because he was protecting his child as a crime was being committed. Police also say Frolander admitted to the sexual battery. Bruised Raymond Frolander stood before a judge and didn't say a word during his first appearance in court. Daytona Beach police arresting Frolander for sexually assaulting an 11 year old boy.

Radon Davot was supposed to give 75 year old Charlene Murphy a mild sedative before a routine procedure, but instead she gave her a lethal dose of the paralyzing agent vecuronium, which comes with this clear warning label. Vaught was convicted of gross neglect of an impaired adult and negligent homicide on Friday, after a three day trial. The victim's family told the judge to show mercy and made it clear that they forgive vaught and claim the victim would also want her to be forgiven. They also made it clear that they did not want her to go to jail. Vaud was facing up to six years in prison. However, she broke down in court after she was given three years probation. Vaught's trial had been closely watched by nurses and medical professionals across the U S, many of whom worry it could set a precedent of criminalizing medical mistakes. Nurses around the country celebrated when she was spared jail time. What do you think about the verdict?

Thirty four year old Robert Fisher was sentenced to 20 years to life behind bars for the rape and murder of three year old Josephina Cunningham. Fisher had forced the girl to consume her mother's medication. He then attacked her and tried to cover up what he had done. Fisher had befriended the child's mother and the child was left in his care on the day she died. During the sentencing, District Attorney Antonia Edwards said Fisher used Clorox wipes to try to conceal his crimes, scrubbing the child's face so hard he rubbed off the pigment. He used these Clorox wipes throughout her body, even placing them inside of her body. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison after taking a plea deal which was only offered to him so the family would not have to sit through a trial and learn the horrible details of his crime. Fortunately, he was recently found dead whilst in prison. The prison refused to reveal the cause of death which is expected to be revealed by the medical examiners. Let me know your thoughts on this in the comments. What do you think happened to him? Was it self inflicted or did the other inmates get to him?

And so today was the last ditch effort with the United States Supreme Court, and it just came down a few minutes ago that the US Supreme Court also will not step in. Of the nine justices, the three that were appointed by democratic presidents all voted to block the execution, whereas the other six, who are appointed by Republican presidents, voted for it to proceed as planned. Y'all, this is truly a miscarriage of justice. An innocent man being put to death for a crime he did not commit, being executed for a crime where the prosecutor has admitted that he's likely innocent, and where the victim's family doesn't want him put to death.

This case made national headlines last year because a young girl had to travel from Ohio to Indiana to undergo an abortion due to restrictions imposed by the Supreme Court after the ruling that overturned Roe versus Wade. At the time of the surgical procedure, the girl had already turned 10 years old. Fuentes, a 28 year old Guatemalan immigrant pleaded guilty to the charges and even though he received a life sentence, he might qualify for Parole after 25 years in prison. The prosecution explained that the girl's mother didn't object to the recommended sentence. The judge criticized the agreement as a bitter pill to swallow because of the possibility that Fuentes could eventually be released from prison. It's worth noting that the doctor who performed the abortion was reprimanded and fined for carrying out the procedure. What do you think about the sentence? Do you believe justice was served?

Dylan was immediately arrested by the police for killing Austin, and when the doctor examined Austin's body, it was revealed that the cause of death was a severe brain injury resulting from the back and forth movement of his head caused by blows. Dylan at the trial kept pleading to the judge that he did not mean to hurt Austin and tearfully apologized, expressing his love for Austin and regret for what had happened. But that quickly went out the window as Dylan later admitted to hitting the child multiple times and eventually placing a pillow over the child's head and repeatedly punching him. And why did he commit such a violent crime? According to Dylan, Austin was crying and was disturbing his baby brother, so he placed the pillow on Austin's head and punched it to stop the crying.

This woman laid on a couch for 12 years until she was basically melted to it. So have you ever heard of Lacey Fletcher? Lacey's parents were Sheila and Clay Fletcher. They moved to Slaughter, Louisiana, about 28 years ago. As soon as they moved to Louisiana, Lacey became involved in her school. She was making friends with all the neighbor kids. She liked to go outside and play. She even joined the volleyball team and seemed like the typical teenager. Lacey was described by her peers as highly intelligent but a little bit immature for her age. Lacey it really enjoyed things that her peers thought of as childish, but she was still very smart and very outgoing. But not much else is known about Lacy. At the age of 14, Lacy's parents decided to homeschool her and that's when she just kind of disappeared from the public. Her friends from school and the neighbor kids just stopped seeing her come out as much as she used to. And it kind of seemed like Sheila and Clay were the reason that.

Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Have y'all heard of the 16 year old boy who raped a girl so bad that he blinded her and paralyzed her? His victim was Quina, who was also a high school student at the time. She was dropping off books at the Bloomfield Regional Public Library and Morris decided to attack her. Morris dragged Quina around the building and he violently raped and beat her. Quina is now unable to swallow, to walk, to talk or function on her own. So what's really odd is that Quina was on the phone and she felt the weird vibes because he was sitting on a bench across from the library. He was staring her down and she was telling her friends like, look, this guy is creepy. I'm ready to just return the books and go back. As she was walking back, her friends heard her screaming on the phone. So one of them made a frantic phone call to 9 1 1. And they also rushed to the scene where they saw there was blood trails everywhere. Her phone also was snapped in half and partially under the car. Now you may be wondering what happened to Morris.

They asked her in panic what had happened. At this moment she was even more devastated. She said their stepfather was holding her neck and stuffing something into her body. He threatened to kill her if she told anyone. Upon hearing these words, the brothers were furious and without hesitation called for their friend's support. They rushed into Quintanilla's room and began attacking him with metal bars. Quentinilla attempted to escape, but the two brothers and their friends continued their pursuit and eventually escaped to a nearby field. They attacked quentinilla again and threw him like garbage in the field. When authorities discovered Quintin Nilla, he was already dead. The police revealed that Quintin Nilla has been wanted for involvement in another underage sexual assault. Now the three are facing charges of first degree murder and may face life imprisonment.

This case made national headlines last year because a young girl had to travel from Ohio to Indiana to undergo an abortion due to restrictions imposed by the Supreme Court after the ruling that overturned Roe versus Wade. At the time of the surgical procedure, the girl had already turned 10 years old. Fuentes, a 28 year old Guatemalan immigrant, pleaded guilty to the charges and even though he received a life sentence, he might qualify for Parole after 25 years in prison. The prosecution explained that the girl's mother didn't object to the recommended sentence. The judge criticized the agreement as a bitter pill to swallow because of the possibility that Fuentes could eventually be released from prison. It's worth noting that the doctor who performed the abortion was reprimanded and fined for carrying out the procedure. What do you think about the sentence? Do you believe justice was served? Let me know in the comments and thank you for watching.

You can see his little legs just going as fast as they can to keep up with the treadmill, like he's full on sprinting. And at some point he can't keep up and he falls off. Like he just rolls off the treadmill and hits the ground. The father picks him up, tosses him back on the treadmill, bites him on top of the head while holding him down on the treadmill and making his feet keep up with the speed. As soon as the father lets him go, he rolls off the treadmill again, bumps his head, hits the floor. He jumps up, gets back on the treadmill, tries to keep up with it again, falls. He repeats this about three or four times. That's where the father is biting him on the head right there. So eventually the father does slow the treadmill down and brings the incline down, but he makes the boy continue to run. So the father and the mother does have like some type of joint custody, shared custody type of situation. I guess. And the mother is the first one to report.

Ah! Get out of my house! A man who raped a teenager outside of a library appeared in court to appeal his 65 year prison sentence. Kendrick Morris was found guilty of a vicious attack on a teenage girl which left her paralyzed and blind. Morris was originally sentenced to 65 years without the possibility of Parole. However, he went to appeals court as he thought the sentence was too harsh considering he was a teenager at the time of the incident. Since Morris was 16 when he committed the crime, he believed he should be eligible for Parole at some point. However, the judge did not sympathize with Morris and instead sentenced him to life in prison. This was not the first Morris had committed and this played a big factor in the judge's decision, as well as the fact Morris was armed during the attack. Morris will be able to have his case reviewed again in 2031, but it seems unlikely he will be released anytime soon. What do you think? Should he be eligible for Parole or spend the rest of his life in prison?

Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flipped, with even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be, but what they would do to him.

This court has reviewed and seen more than its fair share of autopsy photos. The autopsy photos in this particular case were particularly difficult. The 49 defensive wounds indicate that Tristan Bailey was conscious, she was aware, and that she was doing everything she could to fend off this attack. She suffered a painful, horrifying death from someone that she trusted. Her screams were most likely stifled by her own suffocating lungs. He lured her into a secluded place in the woods near his home, a person that she trusted, and he LED her there under false pretenses.

And the petition gathered thousands of signatures. This is 33 year old Benjamin Taylor from West Virginia. And in 2016, he would commit one of the most sickening crimes I've ever read about. Back in 2016, Benjamin was living with his girlfriend, a woman named Amanda Adkins. At the time Amanda had recently given birth only nine months ago to her baby daughter Emily. Emily was a beautiful young girl. And I wanna warn you all right now the details that we're about to discuss are some of the most disturbing I've ever covered. So in October of 2016, Benjamin had only been living with his girlfriend Amanda for about a month. And on the morning of Emily's death at around 4:00am, Amanda woke up and went downstairs to search for her baby. When she went downstairs, she saw Benjamin Taylor with his pants unzipped sitting in the dark. Amanda then noticed that her nine month old daughter's limp body was lying nearby on a pile of sheets and laundry.

And for those venezuelanos that come after me because I keep bringing up crimes committed by venezuelanos, let me tell you this. Never in the history, after 40 years that I've been in this country, I have never seen such an influx of crime committed by Latinos. Never. Latinos, historically, have been in this country to search better opportunities to work, to better themselves, to better their family. Never to come to this country for a handout.

Redonda devout was supposed to give 75 year old Charlene Murphy a mild sedative before a routine procedure, but instead she gave her a lethal dose of the paralyzing agent vecuronium, which comes with this clear warning label. Vaught was convicted of gross neglect of an impaired adult and negligent homicide on Friday, after a three day trial. The victim's family told the judge to show mercy and made it clear that they forgive vaught and claim the victim would also want her to be forgiven. They also made it clear that they did not want her to go to jail. Vaud was facing up to six years in prison. However, she broke down in court after she was given three years probation. Vaught's trial had been closely watched by nurses and medical professionals across the U S, many of whom worry it could set a precedent of criminalizing medical mistakes. Nurses around the country celebrated when she was spared jail time. What do you think about the verdict?

The police were questioning him for the stabbing of an 85 year old woman in Rhode Island. In the interview room was Carpio and two detectives. One of the detectives left the room to get water for Carpio, leaving just him and Detective Sergeant James Allen in the room. Carpio grabbed Allen's gun and then shot him twice, killing him. He then jumped out of a window which was three stories high and made a run for it, but was apprehended Just 45 minutes later. At his arraignment, Carpio came in wearing a mask designed to stop the offender from spitting and biting at others, with also his face being in a rough shape. Stun the courtroom. It wasn't so much Carpio with a shocking reaction, more so his family members making accusations of police brutality. It's Bruce. Police brutality. He was mentally ill. We needed help and we couldn't get it. We tried and tried. An FBI investigation concluded that the police did not use excessive force and that carpios injuries were sustained due to his jump from the third floor of a building and struggle with the law enforcement. Every day I face the facts of what I did and what happened. He was sentenced to life in prison without Parole.

She liked to go outside and play. She even joined the volleyball team and seemed like the typical teenager. Lacey was described by her peers as highly intelligent, but a little bit immature for her age. Lacey, it really enjoyed things that her peers thought of as childish.

Amanda screamed at Benjamin and grabbed her daughter's lifeless body, but he remained silent and stared at the ground. The details of what had just happened down there are disturbing. Local authorities would call this the worst assault that they had seen in decades. You see, Benjamin and Emily were covered in the infant's blood. After the child's body was examined, the authorities were able to determine that she had been assaulted by an adult male multiple times. The infant child was also bleeding extensively and had suffered head trauma. Emily had a fractured skull and brain hemorrhaging. Authorities believe that Emily may have been shaken violently or even thrown to the ground or slammed against a hard object. When police arrived at the scene, Benjamin Taylor was observed trying to wipe something off of his groin. That was eventually determined.

Gavin Ramsey, the teenage perpetrator, invaded 98 year old Margaret Douglas's residence in Wadsworth under cover of darkness last April. He used his phone to record her sleeping, then murdered her and desecrated her corpse while leaving biological evidence at the scene. During court proceedings, Ramsey's family revealed he had endured childhood abuse and been prescribed the antidepressant Zoloft during adolescence, factors they claimed contributed to the horrific crimes. Margaret Douglas's loved ones tearfully described her vivacious personality and passion for life, emphasizing how Ramsey destroyed her dream of reaching 100 years old. The presiding judge sentenced Ramsey to life imprisonment without Parole. His mother accepted partial responsibility in court, admitting she authorized his Zoloft prescription and alleging the medication altered his behavior. Is a life sentence too severe for a 17 year old? Share your perspective on this punishment in the comments.

Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders.

When she went downstairs, she saw Benjamin Taylor with his pants unzipped sitting in the dark. Amanda then noticed that her nine month old daughter's limp body was lying nearby on a pile of sheets and laundry.

Nope. This is not just a boy, but many are terrified. We are watching the final seconds of him and his life is being taken right now. People were terrified after Tiktoker nurse Hannah and her family were allegedly ending the lives of their own young ones in front of us, with many claiming the boy has been calling us for help. But it might now be too late. A haunting viral video shows what allegedly appeared like the boy was cowering after being handed a box at a supermarket, with many parental experts saying it was not a flinch but seemingly a brace for impact. Other parents went viral after showing what would happen if they did the same thing, with many of the videos showing babies laughing or not flinching at all, many to believe that something sinister is happening behind the scenes. Other Nurse Hannah videos went super viral showing the boy's hand being flicked with, even showing the boy another time taking a French fry and then allegedly watching to see not only what their reaction was going to be but what they would do to him. Nurse Hannah has gotten in trouble before for allegedly having 17 dirty diapers around the house. And many allege the situation might be much worse than now.

Leslie Nurse says she was at the self checkout at the Sims Walmart with her husband and three kids fighting a malfunctioning scanner, even getting help from a Walmart associate. After she thought she'd finished and paid, she was stopped by an asset Protection manager. She was eventually charged with stealing $48 worth of groceries. She was eventually arrested, mugshot taken, but the criminal charge was eventually dropped when no one from Walmart showed up to court. By then, she said the damage to her reputation had already been done, her ability to make a living stifled by the criminal charge. What was worse, she continued to receive demand letters from a Walmart affiliated law firm offering to drop the matter if she paid them $200. But it turns out many people do. During testimony in the lawsuit she filed against the company, an expert testified Walmart routinely uses. To add insult to injury, Walmart never produced a video that would have been recorded at the self checkout area that would have proved nurse shoplifted or didn't. At the end of this lawsuit, a unanimous jury found for nurse and awarded her $2.1 million in punitive damages.

Twenty four year old cashier Janelle Broland processed a refund for her and offered to replace her soup but Amanda refused to listen and constantly insulted Janelle in front of her children and other customers. Janelle remained calm and demanded that Amanda stop insulting and leave otherwise she would call the police. Suddenly the customer poured almost boiling soup onto Janelle's face. After Janelle realized it she immediately ran to wash it off but the hot soup had caused severe burns to her face. Blood was flowing from her nose and eyes. Afterwards the police went to Amanda's residence and arrested her. During the trial Amanda refused to plead guilty and was released later that day after paying a fine of $800.

Dad left me at Grandpa's house when I was 11 because his new wife didn't want me around. I thought it was the worst thing ever. But Grandpa taught me everything about farming and business. See, Grandpa wasn't just some old farmer. He owned 500 acres of prime agricultural land worth millions. When dad was growing up, Grandpa was an alcoholic who barely kept the farm running. But by the time I arrived, he'd gotten sober and turned everything around. For seven years, it was just me and Grandpa. He taught me how to work cattle, manage crops, handle finances and run a business. We'd wake up at 5:00am every day, work until sunset, then he'd help me with homework. He never missed a single school event. When he died, he left me everything. Not just the land, the house, the equipment, the bank accounts, everything. I was 18 and suddenly owned more than most people see in a lifetime. Dad didn't even come to the funeral. Didn't call to check on me. Nothing. I spent the next 15 years building Grandpa's legacy. I turned the ranch into a successful agritourism operation. Many families come stay for weeks, learning farm life. I also run a farmers market, sell organic beef and lease land to other farmers. Last year I cleared 800,000 dollar profit. Dad Never called once in 15 years. Not on my birthday, not on holidays. Nothing. I sent him a graduation invitation when I finished my agriculture degree. He didn't show. When I got married three years ago, I didn't even bother inviting him. Then last week, out of nowhere, dad shows up at my door. Not to apologize, not to reconnect. He wanted to talk business. Turns out his precious daughter, my half sister, who I've met exactly twice, struggling financially. Her husband lost his job, they're behind on their mortgage and she needs a fresh start. Dad figured I could just hand over some land and give her a management position. Family sticks together, he says with a straight face. The audacity was unbelievable. This man who abandoned his eleven year old son was lecturing me about family loyalty. I told him I'd think about it, hoping he'd get the hint and leave. Instead, he started texting me multiple times, daily. Detailed messages about which parcels of land would be perfect for his daughter. Suggestions about what roles she could fill in my business. Even ideas about where she and her husband could build a house. The messages got more demanding each day. She deserves this opportunity. Grandpa would have wanted this. You owe the family. It was like he thought my property was some kind of family commune he could just redistribute. After a week of constant harassment, I'd had enough. I called my friend Samuel, who's a local Police officer and asked him how to get a trespass order. Thirty minutes later, I walked out of the station with legal paperwork in hand. Then I asked another close friend, Peter, to take a road trip with me. I need backup for a family reunion. I told him. He didn't ask questions, just grabbed his keys. It took us 10 hours to drive to Dad's house. I needed that time to clear my head and plan exactly what I was going to say. Peter kept offering to drive, but I needed something to do with my hands while I processed everything. We pulled up to Dad's modest

That revealed something heartbreaking instead. I used to think I had parenting figured out. My seven year old son, Lucas, and I had our morning routine down to a science. He would pack his lunch while I made coffee, and we both get ready for our day. Simple, effective, no drama. Then one Tuesday morning, Lucas walked into the kitchen holding a folded piece of paper. Instead of heading straight to the lunch supplies. He looked serious, more serious than any seven year old should look at seven in the morning. I want to make a deal with you, dad, he announced, unfolding the paper carefully. It was a handwritten contract in his messy kid handwriting. The paper said, if I pack my lunch every day for 30 days straight, you have to take me to the zoo on the weekend. No excuses, signed Lucas. I couldn't help but smile. The whole thing was adorable. He'd even drawn little pictures of sandwiches and zoo animals in the margins. I grabbed a pen dramatically and signed my name with a flourish. Deal, I said, and we shook hands like we were closing a business transaction. For the next 29 days, Lucas stuck to that contract like his life depended on it. He woke up 15 minutes earlier every morning to pack his lunch. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, apple slices and little baggies, juice boxes, even tiny napkins with doodles. He'd made the Night before, I thought it was the cutest thing I'd ever seen. Lucas had never been motivated about anything before, especially not something as mundane as lunch packing. But he was so proud of himself each morning, showing me his perfectly packed lunch bag before heading to school. On day 30, I woke up expecting to see my son in the kitchen with his final lunch, ready to claim his zoo trip. Instead, Lucas walked into the kitchen empty handed, looking defeated. No lunch today, buddy? I asked, confused. Lucas pulled a crumpled note from his backpack and handed it to me without saying anything. It was from his teacher, Missus Cooper, the note said. Mister Williams, please call the school when you get a chance. We're concerned about Lucas's eating habits and need to discuss something with you. My stomach dropped. Called the school immediately, and missus Cooper explained something that made my chest feel tight. Lucas hadn't been eating any of the lunches he'd been packing so carefully for the past month. Not a single one. Instead, he'd been giving them away to a classmate named Evan, who came to school without lunch every day. When I picked Lucas up that afternoon, I asked him directly about it. He shrugged and looked down at his shoes. Evan's stomach made really loud growling noises on the first day of school, Lucas said quietly.

The one who gets late night calls for rides. The one who co signs things. My brother Robert is 29, charming, lives on impulse. His fiance Bethany, is intense, obsessed with social media. I never warmed to Bethany. She had this way of complimenting that felt like a slap. It's amazing that you're so stable and practical. Her smile never reached her eyes. Three months ago, they found their dream house in a neighborhood they couldn't afford. Their income wasn't enough for the mortgage. Robert asked me to be the guarantor. A massive 30 year financial risk. I had a lawyer draft a simple agreement with two key clauses. If they defaulted, I could take over their equity for what I paid. And my guarantee was contingent on mutual respect and good faith. Any defamation would be grounds for immediate withdrawal. Robert barely glanced at it. We're brothers. Good faith is a given. We signed it in front of a notary. At a family barbecue last weekend, Bethany came over. Maybe tipsy, stood too close. You're always so serious. You to try to have some fun. It made me uncomfortable, so I walked away. Two days later, my phone exploded with a text from Robert. Bethany had confessed. I've been making her uncomfortable. For months, she claimed I cornered her, whispered she was too good for him, that she should be with a real man who could provide. The accusations were so specific, so venomous. This wasn't a misunderstanding. This was targeted character assassination. I tried calling Robert. No answer. Then the final message. I can't believe you'd do this to us. Bethany is a wreck. Just stay away from us. After 29 years together, my brother was gone. A strange calm settled over me. I texted back. Done. My next call was to the mortgage advisor. Due to a significant personal conflict, I am formally withdrawing as guarantor. Sir, this will almost certainly lead to denial of their entire mortgage application. I am aware of the consequences. Three days later, frantic banging on my door at ten PM. Robert looked like he hadn't slept in days. What did you do? The loan is denied. You torpedoed the whole thing. You told me to stay away. I'm staying away from your finances, too. That was personal stuff. Bethany was upset. You don't ruin someone's future over a fight. A fight is arguing about who helps dad clean gutters. This. It was character assassination. And you believed her? Instantly, without question. His phone buzzed. Bethany's voice. Is he fixing it? Make him fix it. You have to call the bank, Robert demanded. Tell them it was a mistake. No, I'm not a light switch you can flick on and off. You don't get to Treat me like a monster in a bank. In the same week, the family pressure campaign started. Immediately, mom called families work through things, but Bethany launched a smear campaign, spinning stories about my growing jealousy and erratic behavior. Then a certified letter arrived from their lawyer demanding I reinstate the guarantee or face legal action. I was panicking until my girl

And this is not just exclusive to men, but it's just natural for men. But men, from a very early age, like when they're a little boy Onward, are interested in building a mental model of the world. Like, they don't. It's not enough to have GPS. They wanna know all the roads and the streets around them and have it in their head, type thing like that.

He's not an expert on many things, but he just knows random stuff about different wars throughout history and politics and all this stuff. And it's kind of a patchy knowledge, but it's because he was grasping for little pockets of truth and trying to build his model as he was growing up.

One, after going out of town for the weekend, I dropped her off at her friend's house, which was an hour away from where I lived at the time. I told her I had to get back home to get ready for work the next day. She was begging me to stay and hang out some more, but I kept saying I had to get home. After about 15 minutes, I went to go to my car to leave. She hopped onto the hood of my car and refused to get off. After 10 more minutes of trying to talk her down, I gave up, got into my car, locked the doors, tilted the seat back and acted like I was taking a nap. She sat on my hood for another 20 minutes or so before it started to rain. That's what finally got her off of my car. Fine, go home, see if I care or something whiny like that. And she stormed off into her friend's house, never contacted her again. 2 her Rex just happened to be walking outside the restaurant we were at and she invited him in to sit at our table and have dinner with us. I protested, but I had to take a leak and the food was arriving, so I went to the bathroom. When I came back, the food date and dates ex had all disappeared. The time between this dude sitting At our table, the food arriving and me coming back from the bathroom was less than 5 minutes. 3. I have a very common last name. She had the same last name. The date went well. She said she couldn't go out with me on a second date, though, because it felt too weird. She explained that both her father and her brother also have the same first name as me, so all three of us have the exact same first and last name. I was like, whoa, yeah, that would be weird for me too. And we actually ended up staying pretty good friends. After 4, her apartment looked like it was ransacked by wolves. I'm not even exaggerating. This was a city apartment, so I'm quite sure there were no wolves. Most of the furniture was knocked over, boxes everywhere. No clear delineation between laundry, food and garbage. 5. She was one of the cutest girls I met online and we had a nice dinner. Then she asked if I wanted to meet up with her friends for more drinks down the street. I thought that was fine. It seemed like a good sign she wanted to keep hanging out. However, she didn't say another word to me the rest of the night. Once we met up with them, I just sat and listened to their conversation for an hour, then awkwardly left. 6, she ordered an obnoxious amount of expensive food while I barely ate one order. She then passed me the Bill thinking I was dumb, flagged the waiter and asked them to rewrite the order as separate bills, paid for mine and left her there. 7. He chewed with his mouth open and talked with a mouthful of food. He chugged his drink and then asked if I was going to finish mine. It was half full and I planned on finishing it. I was so grossed out that I let him finish mine so the date would end quicker. 8. We were at a restaurant that he visits a lot, so he knew the workers well and was friendly with the bartender who seemed interested in him. Halfway through the date, after talking to the bartender a few times, he flat out asked her on a date in front of me. She was a little confused since he was there with me but said yes. I was sitting there like, um, okay, this is awkward. Before she left to go take care of other customers, he goes, hahaha, I'm just messing with you. You're definitely not my type. And she looked so sad and upset. She was such a sweet and gorgeous girl. So that was super confusing. When she walked away, he was like, I only like girls like you. not sure if he was trying to prove to me that other girls are into him or just messing with someone to mess with them. But I hated it so much. 9. She was absolutely horrible to the wait staff, just a straight up dismissive, entitled person to the girl who had to serve us. I power through the meal, left that girl a 75% tip for the trouble and never called that woman again.

I once had an ex come to me in the middle of the night saying she wanted to run away with me. Everything she did was monitored by her family. So to appear out of nowhere was a huge surprise by itself. During that time, I realised how vulnerable she was and how much she loved and needed me in ways that no relationship should hopefully ever have to experience. And I couldn't have ever conceived in my wildest dreams as a random boy growing up in the Pacific Northwest, this was literally, I have no future with my family and I am a commodity to my family. The next day, her uncle came to my parents door. They didn't know where I lived, so probably a tracking app or something similar. She was taken away and sent to India after they realized she was in a relationship with a boy that they hadn't first approved of. I'd send her a bedtime story or a few paragraphs of love and affirmation every few days when she got back. We tried, but she was changed and defeated and broke up. 2. I was in the hospital after emergency surgery complications from a C section the week before. My now ex husband wouldn't answer my calls. Finally, my doctor called from the hospital phone and he answered. She told him what was happening and He said, call me if she doesn't make it and hung up. Later, after surgery, when I was in the most pain of my entire life and scared out of my mind, I called him. He answered and just sat in silence for a minute listening to me cry. Then he said to me, what have I told you about calling me when you're crying? And hung up. Didn't answer the phone for me again for almost a week. That marriage did not last a long time. 3. My ex once casually mentioned that they don't believe in apologizing because they never do anything wrong. That one sentence changed everything. I realized I'd never get accountability or real empathy from them. 4, I had an ex who I thought was totally normal until the first time I was with her in front of her grandparents. She was so rude and then told me afterward that she feels like the elderly are a waste and a drain on families in society. It didn't last long after that. Five, my ex once told me that he hoped my father would pass so I could see what it's like when things aren't handed to you on a silver platter. He said it was easier for me because my dad worked abroad and apparently that meant I had some sort of special advantage in life. I left him after that. 6, my ex partner said that I was too emotional to be around after I found out he dropped my elderly dog off at the vets and told them he was abandoned and put him down. My energy was chaotic after he manipulated me into leaving my house with my children so he could move back in with his new girlfriend two months after we split. 7, you need glasses. She was right. 8, my ex told me that the Dinosaur bones were placed by the creator as a test of faith and there was nothing I could say that would convince him otherwise. Then I realized that any potential children I had with him would likely be taught this by their father. 9, broke up in July. He said he'd pay me back and he still hasn't. Ten, my ex was feeling under the weather and was telling me he needed to get over the counter medication and he had no idea what to get. I was a nurse and recommended something, including how and when he should take it. He scoffed. You're a nurse, a doctor's assistant, not even a pharmacist. I realized he didn't respect me or nurses at all. We broke up a month later. 11, my boyfriend at the time proudly declared that he'd never read a book cover to cover. He was 27. Damn shame.

Friend's mom was sort of weird. She was usually in her bedroom on her computer unless she was in the living room demanding us to paint her nails. Anyways, the rule was to eat before you got there because you wouldn't be fed while there. If you're there while they have dinner, you sit in the living room or my friend's bedroom and wait. Weirdly, this extended to breakfast than any other meal had while I was there, no matter how long I was there. Anyways, I figured out by age 8 that I could go three days max without eating before I passed out and got sent home. 2. I slept over a friend's house in grade school. One time he prepared us a bowl of cereal the next morning for breakfast, not thinking anything of my behavior. I didn't finish the milk. I just never used to. I don't know. He was like, are you are you going to finish that? Me? I don't think so. Him? Does that matter? He panicked. Absolutely panicked. he put it down the toilet before his parents came back into the room. I don't know what the rule was exactly, but based on his reaction, I still feel bad about it. I was like 8. And didn't think now that I'm older I realize his family probably didn't have much and he didn't want them to see anything being wasted 3 the family would just put all the plates on the floor for the dog to lick clean before putting them back in the cupboard 4 when I was around 8 I went to a friend's house for a playdate slash dinner after school when I asked for a drink her mom gave me a baby bottle with squash in it I laughed but she didn't laugh back my friend took her own bottle and started drinking I asked the mom if I could please have a cup instead but she told me no and that children drink from bottles in their house never went there again. 5 I I went to see a college friend over the summer stayed the night her parents weren't home when I got there and we went into the living room to talk there were 4 recliners no couch or other chairs she sat in one recliner I sat in another she asked what are you doing and informed me I was sitting in her dad's chair the remaining chairs belonged to her mom and brother where was I supposed to sit on the floor? 6 they yelled at me for not letting the cat that was walking around on the table eat from my plate I love cats but what in the world apparently gently nudging the cat Away from my food was interfering with the freedom of another sentient being. I was 12. I think I was pretty freaked out. Seven, when I was a kid, my friend's dad made his kids line up on the couch and just sit there silently while they watch TV and sip. If you were visiting, you had to do it too. When my mom heard about it, I wasn't allowed to go over there when he was home. My mom knew a weirdo's behavior when she saw it. Eight, I had a friend who instead of washing the dishes after a meal, just put them straight back in the cupboard. I thought his parents would freak out, but it turns out it was just something they did in their house. Whenever I went over, I always made sure to eat beforehand. 9, my friend must ask his father before he is allowed to eat anything in their house. One time our group of friends wanted to go out on a Friday night. We asked if he could come and our friend said he was grounded. We asked him what he did this time and he responded, I ate a bowl of cereal when my dad wasn't home. Probably the saddest thing I've ever heard someone get grounded for. And if I went over to eat dinner with them, I was given the options of water, bottled water, mineral water or milk. I would say milk, but apparently when you say Milk, that translates to a glass of water. 11. Don't put keys on the table. Superstition that supposedly brings bad luck. I guess I have terrible luck. Been doing it all my life.

One. One of those self serve yogurt places opened up shop in a crappy mall. To get people in, they put stacks of coupons out in offices near them for a free small yogurt. They neglected to put an expiration date on any of them. I gathered all of them that were at my office and even found some in a handful of places near the yogurt place. I've been eating free yogurt for the last 20 months. Two. In the final semester of my senior year in high school, I decided to take a class called Physics 2. I like the first physics class I took. I thought that this would be a fun class to go out on. Wrong. It was basically AP Physics. I was in way over my head. At the end of the semester, I had a D minus going into the final. Our final project was about buoyancy. The task was to build a boat that could support you and your partner out of nothing but cardboard, glue, and 20 inches of duct tape. If you could paddle to the end of a pool and back with you and your partner in the boat, you would get an A on that aspect of the project. Then my teacher made the mistake of offering an extra incentive. For every length of the pool you could go beyond that without sinking, you'd get 40 extra credit points, extra Credit was my only hope. We went out and found the sturdiest cardboard we could find. We carefully folded, glued, and cut the cardboard into a canoe type of boat. It looked great. The day finally came. The entire class brought their boats out and we started. Most people made it to the end of the pool before their boats started to disintegrate. We go in and start paddling. We make it to the end and paddle back, then out and back again and again and again. We crossed the pool 60 times before our teacher made us stop. We did not sink. We both earn 2,400 extra credit points. I went from a D minus to an A on the very last final I ever had in high school. True story and one of my greatest days. Three. I earn double points on my credit card through gas and grocery purchases. So when I plan to buy something, say at Lowe's, or go out to eat, I go to the grocery store and buy a gift card. Double points for the gift card and at least double fuel points through the grocery store. 4. Some news magazines was asking college students to send out subscription forms by email to all their friends. For each 25 emails you sent, you would get a ten dollar Amazon gift card. Turns out they didn't need to be real emails. I made about 100 dollars before they told me to stop. Five. There Was a McDonald's near my college, and in it was an ATM. If you use the ATM and got a receipt, it would come with a coupon for a buy one get one free large sandwich. I'd swipe my card, hit cancel, and a receipt would print out showing the cancellation. I would then find someone in line buying a large sandwich and hand it over to them. Free sandwiches for about eight months until it finally went away. 6 when our whole Algebra 2 class figured out how grading on a curve works, we statistically used it to our advantage. Average grade on our finals was a 52, so the whole class passed without really even trying on it. Seven some games had a deal involving discounted purchases for trading in games. They also had bargain games for $2. You can see where this is going. 8 at a very old local hometown cemetery, it turns out that people who bought the original family plots have free grave openings and grave closings included in the deed. So now, generations later, families can't be charged for grave digging at the time of funerals if the family is still in possession of the original deeds. 9. My local pizza chain gives you a free pizza if you sign for their newsletter. I have many email addresses.

One, I have to give pretty bad news on a frequent basis. Most people know it's coming. During my last week in residency, I had to tell a mother that her daughter wasn't going to make it. She came in talking the night before and had surgery for a life threatening problem. We thought she would make it. After halfway through the day, her vitals and labs took a nose dive and it was obvious that our efforts had only temporized her, but we lost. She was intubated and peaceful, but she was young and had two small kids. We have all seen the TV drama style screams, pounding on the table, begging for someone to do something, sobbing. When it's reality, it's so much harder. Her mom was crying on the floor asking me to take her organs to save her daughter. I'm not emotional, but that day wrecked me. I went to the bar after with my attending and we didn't talk. I try not to think about it. 2 er DOC, I just had a young lady brought in. She was only 22. Her brother came as we were coding her chest compressions. We had done everything and there was no bringing her back. I asked if he wanted to be in the room when we stopped and he said yes. His reaction was heartbreaking. Screamed and cried and then Picked up her body and whispered in her ear, I love you so much, you're my best friend. And just held her and kept saying, I love you. All the staff had to take a moment after that. I'll never forget them. 3, telling a very young patient that their condition, which was assumed to be curable through surgery, was in fact not so because it had spread to the brain. It was a rare condition that rarely spreads and that rarely affects younger people. Some people get all the terrible luck in the world. The patient was remarkably stoic, but one of the parents lost it. The tears, wailing, pleading and breakdown aren't anything I'll forget. The rage against the system, the accusations, I must be wrong, and then the pleading and tears again. I think it's the fact I took their hope away from them. There is no happy ending to this story, but I'm the one who had to tell them. Years later, I can still see their face and grief. It's burnt into my memory. And it took a while to accept that perhaps trying so hard to forget would disrespect the patient's memory. I'm trained to deliver bad news and do it regularly. This one remains one of the only times where a case utterly emotionally broke me. Four, a patient of mine I hadn't seen in forever came to emerge because he couldn't manage at home, was too weak and losing weight. Blue collar Guy, I took one look at the 50 pound weight loss on him and knew, DOC, I think I'm on the way out. He said, not going to lie to you. I'm worried about that too, I said. Five, not a doctor, but a midwife. Whenever a pregnant patient comes in with reduced movement, I hold my breath until we find the Houdini's heartbeat. But sometimes it's not there. The gut wrenching cry of a parent being that there is no heartbeat is unmistakable. It gets me every time. 6. I told a woman that her husband wasn't going to make it and I didn't know why and probably couldn't do anything to prevent it. She thanked me and later sent a card after her husband passed. I hope she's doing okay. 7. Nurse here. I once stood in the hall and listened while a surgeon told a 22 year old girl that after weeks of trying, the only option left was to amputate her leg. The sound the girl made will never leave me. 8. Probably the one that stands out is telling a young dad that his wife and baby passed in a road transport accident. I think it was the whimpering, soft crying that got me got out of critical care. After too many of those types of situations. It was wearing me down. 9. Patience. Mom, are you telling me that I am going to lose my son today? Me? Yes.

I know you guys want to be inclusive and all but I always feel behind on all the letters you add to LGBT. So is it fine I just say LGBT plus? This is not meant to not be inclusive. I'm all for LGBT plus but sometimes it gets a bit too many letter for me personally. So will I offend you guys if I only say LGBT plus or are you guys fine with it? 2 to trans women also English is my third language so I may be be offending if so my apologies. Many CIS women are modest or shy about their bodies while men can whip out their shirt and not be a wit embarrassed. Does your relationship to your body change after like transition or when you came to the realization that you are trans? Again, I don't mean to be offensive just curious. Also, we've started putting pronouns in our email signatures at work and I've seen a few people put she, they or he they and I'm curious why I'm sure each person is different but I wonder why they are okay with a gendered pronoun but then also want to be called they. Anyone here? You, she, they or he, they and could give me some insight. 3. What should I say to someone who comes out to me saying, um, okay Or that's nice sounds like I'm dismissing them but trying to ask questions or engage in conversation about it seems intrusive. 4 is it okay to use adjacent urinal slash talk at the urinals if you two are dating or married? 5. What does non binary mean? I'm from Italy and I've never met someone who came out as non binary or even transgender my brother met a guy once and he my brother said he looked gender fluid gender fluid is the only term used here nobody talks about non binary I know that non binary means that you don't identify with one gender specifically I guess but I really really don't get it. 6 would people get offended if I just use the word they for literally everything? I've accidentally had it ingrained in my brain so unless they literally tell me what their pronouns are I will use they hey look I did it again. 7 when two women get married are they both brides or would one prefer to be called the groom? Same for two men are both grooms. 8 how did you find out you were trans if it was because of gender roles and clothing that society has forced on us how would you find that you were trans if it were not like that? Sorry if this offends anyone I am having a hard time understanding. 9 where do you think the line should be drawn in trans women taking part in Women's sports, how can women's sports be inclusive whilst also being fair and safe for everyone taking part? Also, I have never called myself CIS, so why do you feel the need to label me in this way? It's like you will accept the terms that we have made up for you. It's a label being put on without you having agreed to it. I'd like to be called a female, not a CIS female, but apparently that's the new lingo. 10, to trans folks, how does it feel to be complimented when you're the person you want to be? I complimented a trans person and they almost started crying in the bathroom. I thought they looked beautiful and so I gave them a compliment. They came back the next day and gave me coffee and a thank you note. Very sweet. Person 11, why is the drag show subculture of men portraying women in extraordinarily cartoonish and overtly offensive caricaturistic ways performed in schools? I'll go ahead and recognize my question includes some assumed opinions.

He got a pretty substantial year end bonus from work. He decided to use most of it for his wife's Christmas gift and pay off her remaining student loans. Around $14,000 and the remaining portion to buy a new computer chair for when he gained, which cost around 300. For Christmas morning. He was nice enough to let me stay at his place when I traveled for work, as he lived 20 minutes from the airport. We all woke up and had breakfast. His family and her parents came over and we started exchanging gifts. Besides paying off her loans, he had gotten her a few items. When she opened the card saying her loans were paid off, she just sat there for a minute. After the silence and assuming she was kind of in shock, she asked did you seriously not get me anything else? I bought you that stupid keyboard. The wrong one by the way, and you only got me a few things. At that point, his brother in law and I decided to go hang out in another room for a while. They ended up getting into a huge fight. A day later when he was dropping me off at the airport, he told me that he was going to visit a lawyer and get a Divorce, too. She let me know we were expecting a child and wanted my permission to tell all her girlfriends during a girl's night out, since I knew there was no possible way it was my child. She was also unknowingly admitting to having an affair. I can do math and she can't. It was with her boss. Loired up the next day and he ate her alive in court. I got primary custody of our child we already had and child support and a sheriff's notice that she had to vacate my home in 30 days. I never knew she could be that dumb. 3. When she staged a robbery of our house so she could pawn all of my things to get some money. 4 I was a lance corporal bringing home scraps for a paycheck to an unemployed wife who one day brought home a brand new Lexus LS THREE FIFTY because she got a good deal on it. Apparently I was supposed to pay the $800 a month Bill. I didn't think it was a good deal. 5. When my buddies approach me to complain that she's finding excuses to be around them. Super awkward when your buddy's wife is finding any excuse to flirt with you. If you say something, you risk causing a fight or him not believing you. If you say nothing, you're the bad guy. Six. We flew across the country for her sister's wedding. She didn't say a word to me the entire Time since we had parked at the airport. Once we landed at our destination, we walked to the baggage claim. Absolute silence had been proceeding for several hours now at the carousel, I picked up her bag when she took it out of my hand and calmly stated, none of my family knows you're here. I told them I came alone. She walked out of the airport and left me there. That did it. 7 when she moved out while I was camping with two of our sons, and there was no discussion of whether her leaving was permanent or potentially temporary in her view. Eight not a wife, but a fiance. Just called it off because we were house hunting and she kept wanting to look at houses that would accommodate an extra permanent guest. Her estranged father, whom she was wanting to reinitiate ties with but wouldn't admit to it, found out from a buddy that she wanted me to lay out the money for the down payment and then was going to break it off herself and fight to keep the house to herself. Two years down the drain, but a lifetime of a fortunate near Miss. 9 I was on deployment and she yelled at me for interrupting her family Celebration when I called on Christmas. Trifling

I'll never forget the first time I looked up into the night sky after I got glasses and realized that you can, in fact, see the moon clearly. I assume people who depicted it in art were taking creative license because they knew it should look like that for some reason and that the human eye was incapable of seeing the moon without also seeing two other blurrier moons sort of overlapping it. It blew my mind. 2. You don't have to rip the plastic top off of your new deodorant with your teeth or pliers or anything. You can just turn the base until it comes up enough to just take it off. My wife, who is in her 30s, handed me a new deodorant stick because she couldn't get the plastic piece off that they cap new sticks with. I took it, twisted the bottom a couple of times to push the stick up and took the cap off. She looked at me like I was a witch. She had for most of her life struggled with new sticks of deodorant and had no idea you could just push the stick up first, then take the cap off. Also, I Learned this yesterday, actually. Apparently, you need to RSVP to events even if you will not be attending. Three, I thought that horses had toes until I was 22. I thought the hoof was a horseshoe show. And The toes were tucked inside. How did I learn how wrong I was, you ask? I was walking past a cavalry museum and saw a horse statue and loudly remarked, it must hurt so bad when they fold a horse's toes to put them into the shoe. Dozens of horse enthusiasts turned and looked at me with wild bewilderment in their eyes. 4. I used to think that the diet soda bottles on the side of the road, which were half full of pale yellow liquid, were unfinished diet soda that had been bleached by the sun. About two years ago, I saw one of these bottles being ejected from a truck and I realized the awful truth. I'm 53. 5. That Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant and not an assembly line of workers making cheesecake. I always envisioned you would go in there and watch them and eat a slice, sort of like a brewery. 6. When I was getting my license on my 16th birthday, the lady at the DMV asked me if I wanted to register as an organ donor. My mom said yes, and I was horrified. I thought until 16 years of age that being an organ donor meant that if someone needed your organ, that they would contact you to come in and they would take it from you. 7. My sister is one of the smartest people I have ever known. Like never gotten a B in her entire school life. She's now A doctor of physical therapy who runs her own clinic. This woman at 31 years old called the family one day and says, did you guys know it's called fall because leaves fall off the tree? This woman can tell you the name of every muscle in your body and this is what she comes up with. Lol. 8. Arguing with strangers is pointless and that most adults are just children in suits. 9. Women's garments have different button arrangements than men's. I bought this wonderful coat, flannel, on sale one year when I was working in Alaska over winter. I figured it was on sale because the buttons were opposite and there was just some manufacturing error. I'm an engineer, so it's just what I assumed. Wore it home for Christmas and my mom instantly asked, why are you wearing a woman's coat? It was a joke the whole week I was visiting family. Do I still wear that coat? Absolutely. 10. As a child, my wife didn't know she was supposed to close her eyes to fall asleep. She was just laying there staring at the ceiling waiting for her poor brain to shut off sometime around 3 a. M.

I giggled nervously. Um, yeah, why? No, no, no, no, no, she suddenly screamed while walking as far away from me as possible. I just laughed because moms can be so weird sometimes. But the next day, my daughter came home from school crying. Mommy, Leah said her mom said she can't talk to me anymore. Leah was her best friend. I immediately took out my phone and texted her mom asking if everything was okay. No response. I texted Emily's mom, one of the other girls in her trio. Still nothing. I had just managed to calm my baby girl down when the pizza arrived. Usually our delivery guy is the Apator 5,000. But tonight he just set the box on my doorstep and practically ran away. George, you forgot your tip, I yelled, waving a 20. He just kept going. The next few days were insane. At my daughter's soccer practice, Helen saw me walking towards her and held her phone to her ear. No one had even called her. Helen, what's going on? She mouth, sorry and walked faster. We used to complain about our husbands together. Parents were whispering and showing each other something on their phones. When I walked by, they'd quickly put them away. By Thursday, my daughter was refusing to go to school. They moved my desk away from everyone else. The Teacher said it was for space reasons, but there's like 10 feet between me and Leah now. I tried to bring her to the hairdresser to cheer her up, but when the woman saw me coming, she closed early. No apology. Just flipped the sign and pulled the blinds. My phone buzzed. It was my landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry, rent can wait this month. This was the same man who charged me a 50 dollar inconvenience fee when I paid rent at 12:00am instead of midnight. Then the birthday party, Emily's sleepover. My daughter found out that everyone was invited except her. She was having such a bad panic attack that I had to call a hospital. Mom, what did I do? Emily is my best friend. Enough was enough. I called the school office. Something is happening to my daughter. She's being systematically excluded and I need answers right now. The counselor called back within an hour, but her voice was off like she was choosing every word carefully. Missus Cal, Hannah, we just wanted to check in about your home environment. Is everything safe? Anyone new spending time around your daughter? What? What are you even asking me? I think it's best if we discuss this in person. Can you come in tomorrow morning? No. You'll tell me right now why my daughter is being tortured. Long pause. The principal will explain everything tomorrow. Beep. She hung up. Then at eleven PM, an email from my Gym membership terminated effective immediately. I've been going there for five years. The owner knew me by name. I was trying to figure out what to do when my daughter crawled into my bed at 2:00am sobbing, Mommy, am I ugly? It took everything in me not to burst into tears. The lunch lady wouldn't look at me today. She just pointed at my tray. I finally caved. On Saturday morning, I found myself walking towards the principal's office while being escorted by a security guard. Other parents there for Saturday sports held their kids against the walls as we passed. One mom literally shielded her son with her body like we were dangerous. In his office, the principal locked the door behind us. The click was so loud in the silence, he walked to the windows and twisted the blinds shut. My daughter grabbed my hand tighter. Please sit down. I'll stand. What is this about? He sat at his desk, fingers hovering over his keyboard, then pulled them back. Mister Griffin, you're scaring me. Missus Callahan. He was looking at his screen, not at me. When did you last speak to your ex husband? Christmas. Why? And you haven't been in contact since then? No communication at all? No. We exchange texts about pickup times maybe once a month. What does this have to do with anything? He turned his monitor slightly, then back like he was debating something. Some information has come to our attention about your Former husband, the parents. What information? What are you talking about? I need to show you something, but I want you to prepare yourself. My legs felt weak. I sat down, pulling my daughter onto my lap. It's from two weeks ago. The parents have been. He paused. I've been very concerned. He finally turned the screen toward me. Local news website. The headline hit me first, then his face, my ex husband's face in a mugshot. Full story on channel link below.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her co worker Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. He showed me his Instagram, tall brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem, he didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed. After that first dinner, my mom kept inviting him back. Mr brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about basketball scores, my Dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us, said she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly, made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me, we can't keep this up forever, you know, that message hit me like a truck. I realised he was ready to end this whole thing and I wasn't, not even close. Instead of texting back or Giving him some weird speech. I invited him over for dinner at my place, cooked his favourite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over, set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them, just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this.

Nobody likes a lunch thief and I had one of the most aggressive at my office. There were rumors for a few months leading up to the inciting incident of someone going around and taking people's lunches. Just about every day someone different would complain that their lunch was missing. It even happened to me once or twice. But I figured, hey, it's a big office. A few people are probably just careless and grab the wrong lunch and are too embarrassed to bring it back. Or someone else packs their lunch and they don't know what's in there so it's not obvious they have the wrong one or whatever. Most people just brought brown bags with their names on it anyways or identical rubber made Tupperware with a little piece of label tape on the side. It was easy enough to mix it up. I had accidentally grabbed the wrong lunch once or twice, but I'd noticed before I got it open. I thought I was just more careful or even just not as busy as some other people in the building. However, other people weren't as forgiving and a quorum made complaints to HR. They were blown off. Personally at the time I thought it was all much ado about nothing. But then it began. My wife enrolled in a French cooking class online and just about every day I was Bringing fancy gourmet leftovers in for lunch, you'd think I was picking up a to go bag from a Michelin starred bistro on the way in. Each morning, she really threw herself into the coursework. There were no problems for about two weeks, maybe three, until one day my lunch went missing. Considering what delicacies I had to look forward to, I was pretty miffed. But I did it once over around the break room and didn't see anyone eating my lunch. So figured someone grabbed my bag by accident earlier, saw how good things looked and realizing it was their lucky day, didn't bring it back to the fridge. I wrote the mysterious stranger off as an asshole, but accepted the loss and looked forward to dinner that night instead. Next day, I write my name on my lunch in extra bold lettering, jam the bag into the back of the fridge and feel peace of mind. I get there come break time, nope, it's gone. I was pretty upset, but I figured it was a stroke of bad luck and left it at that. What else could I do? However, on the third day, out of an abundance of caution, I kept my lunch at my desk. A pain because I had to eat it fairly early in the day to avoid spoilage, but at least I'd know where it was. I got up to take care of some business down the hall and when I came back, Yep, my lunch was gone. Unfortunately, that didn't help me narrow it down much at all because my desk is centrally located, so everyone's constantly passing by. At that point, there was no possibility of the theft being arbitrary. So I approached HR and filed a complaint. Their response, practically verbatim was employees lunches are their personal property and the company is not responsible for lost or stolen personal item.

I had an employee who was a strict vegetarian for religious reasons. One day we were discussing the employee salad bar and he mentioned how much he loved the Caesar dressing packets they offered. I was surprised and stupidly blurted out, oh, I didn't realize you ate fish. He responded that he was vegetarian and gave me a quizzical look. I had to explain that the salad dressing contained both fish and Parmesan cheese, which is almost always cultured with animal rennet. He didn't believe me and the next day insisted on reading the ingredients on one of the packets to me to prove to me that I was wrong. Then he got to the anchovies and got quiet, too. My best friend in high school was humongous and would sweat profusely. We would come in after lunch in Texas and he would smell awful. I think he would wear his clothes without washing them after sweating. We had English after and the AC sucked, so the teacher put a fan in the window. He would sit in front of the fan and blow his funk over everyone. The class got together and voted that I should be the one to tell him. Well, I had to break it to him that for the last year, he has smelled horribly. I felt pretty bad, but he never stunk again. 3. I had to tell My friend that the online girlfriend he'd been talking to for months was actually a scammer using stolen photos. He was planning to send her money to come visit. And breaking the news to him was one of the toughest conversations I've ever had. 4. I had a friend ask me about some green sign in the distance. It was in fact a bright orange sign giving off an intense orange light, which sodium vapor is known for. I had to tell him right there that he was colorblind. He was in his mid 30s too. A lot of odd things that had happened in his past fell into place for him that day. Five, I had to tell my mom that my grandma, her mom didn't make it and had been buried a month before. My mom had been in a coma for around six weeks during that time. At one point they were actually in the ICU in beds beside each other. Neither ever knew. So yeah, that sucked. 6. I had an old friend that I lived with at the time. He'd been getting obviously catfished for years, thankfully not monetarily. Just a lonely girl looking for attention over the phone and internet. But he just refused to believe the signs. He claimed to have talked a bunch on the phone and we didn't really believe him. Eventually she asked for money for a ticket and we were all like, there it is. And he finally believed Us. He decided to put it to a test to prove it once and for all and told her that he'd bought her a ticket for the flight, assuming she'd make up an excuse to get out of it. He didn't really buy the ticket. Well, to his surprise, the day of, he got a call from her at the airport panicking because they couldn't find the ticket. He managed to play it off as a mistake and was able to get her on the flight. They dated for 5 years and she came out every summer for like 5 years before they grew apart. So guess I was wrong. Seven, I hate to break it to you, but the hardest moment was telling my best friend that their partner was for the streets. They were so in love and completely blinded by it. And when I broke the news, it shattered their world. It even strained our friendship for a while because sometimes even when you're trying to help, the truth is too painful to accept. 8, an employee confided in me that she contracted the clap and was talking about how she got it from the toilet seat at work because she is monogamous with her husband. I was like, girl, he ain't monogamous with you. 9, my wife telling me that she wants a divorce about 30 minutes ago. I sure hope that I will be okay. Later, it struck me like lightning. 10 when my ex Tried to make me choose between my dog and him.

One, how 24 hour it is. Nobody even blinks when you get up at 3:00am to meet a flight or make a deployment muster. Half the people you know are asleep at three PM their duty next week will probably be different. So you meet friends for cards or a meal at 6:00am or six PM doesn't really matter. Also the different food you eat. After a couple of decades of chow line food, Pan Global, Military Wife Pot locks and TDY and Turd World dumps, you don't even care if you have never seen that dish before in your life or if it's squirming. If the guy next to you isn't deceased, you will probably eat it too. Never leave your Tabasco bottle at home so you can get the bugs too. How non military life on a submarine is. It's already a stressful environment so nobody really wants to pile on top of that. Don't get me wrong, they do their jobs and they do them well. But this straight laced military bearing you see in movies is not really there. My command had to gently remind enlisted types not to refer to the junior officers by their first names. Under way, shaving daily was a luxury. So everyone had some sort of stubble, hair got too long, uniforms, coveralls got torn, stained and just generally jacked up, especially if you worked in the engine room. We all Wore civilian sneakers or slip ons as Navy boots made way too much noise. All that said, if there was a real or simulated emergency, everyone immediately shifted to 100% by the book. Those were some of the finest, most prepared people I've ever worked with. So if you want to see real life on a submarine, watch down. Periscope 3. I found that the idea of a chain of command really messes with the heads of those who never served in the military. 4, dependapotamus. It's something I Learned about a few years ago. Basically, the young guys are desperate to get better housing, so they get married to women who prey on young military men because they get good benefits, health, pension. The women are dependents. The potomus comes from the idea that most of them end up getting gluttonous and slothful, mooching off of their husbands who are away at war and get rather large. It's sad.

Moment one the other day my 18 year old brother in law got married to his high school sweetheart in a parking garage so that they can live off campus at college together. His now wife's mother is an ordained minister. His parents, my in laws were very upset and he couldn't understand why saying it's just a fake marriage for school. Oh no, sweet boy, you are married. I just laughed and laughed. I love him dearly but he's a moron. His wife lost her scholarship because they live off campus and became residents of the state and she no longer qualifies. 2. My dad used to be the typical boomer, always thinking I was just being lazy and not doing things right until he got injured and could no longer work in an industry he had 30+ years of experience and seniority in. It took him several months to get a new job of any kind and was shocked when he realized that he couldn't just negotiate for higher pay. He was fired on the spot when he threatened to organize a strike and was barred from the premises. When he had to move, it baffled him that he couldn't just give the landlord a few hundred bucks and move in right away but had to wait a week for his application to go through and the landlord to do a background check. Probably my Most satisfying one was when he finally decided to get into the industry. I'm in truck driving. He Learned very fast that it wasn't like it is in the movies from the 80s. Truckers don't know nor ever have given a darn about one another. Sure, some are nice to one another, but if it's a choice of you or them, don't hold your breath. Most big trucking companies in the US are only concerned about your safety because it saves them money on lawsuits. After his third trucking job ended with him getting terminated and is now living off my income, he stopped giving me crap about my problems and is still job hunting. 3. There was a young girl I used to work with a target. She was hired for the 6:00am to two thirty PM shift, but she regularly showed up between 8 to 9:00am without any good explanation. After the third time or so, our supervisor asked her if she had something to do in the morning such as getting kids ready for school that required a later shift. If so, she could be moved to the 8:00am to four thirty PM shift. Girl's response was no, I still want to leave at 2:30. I just don't want to get up that early. She was fired when she refused to acknowledge that you cannot make your own schedule. 4. My boss told me about a friend of his who told him they have a life hack She would get her bills in the mail, not pay them, and then wait a couple of months to pay. Then she would cry so the debt collectors would feel bad and waive the fees for not paying on time. That was her brilliant life. Hack. 5, a dude 18 years old in boot camp got a letter from home and I could see he was agitated being 22 and concerned for his well being. I asked him if he wanted to talk about it. I'm thinking a Dear John letter or the mom and dad divorcing letter. He told me that his younger brother got a Mercedes for his birthday and that he was upset because he only got a BMW. Can't remember what I said, but I knew boot camp was gonna do him in. It did. 6, when I was in boot camp, some kid put his letter addressed to mom with no address attached. 7. They did a study and there's a lot of people who have winning the lottery part of their retirement plan. 8. My old roommate was only paying $25 on her credit cards every month, but was putting almost every purchase on them. I felt so bad explaining to her that she was now in credit card debt. 9, girl asks me to do her shift for her. She has a doctor's appointment, okay, on payday, she asked for the money for that shift. Uh, no, it doesn't work that way.

One, 20 years ago I was standing on my back porch lighting up and talking on the phone. This cop comes out of the forest behind the house soaking wet and covered in MUD. He walked right up into my yard and I asked if he needed help. He told me to get my fat ass back into the house or he'd arrest me. I just stood there as that cop walked through my yard and away to wherever he was going. 2, About 35 years ago when I was a teenager, the house was broken into. Detectives thought I did it as an inside job. My dad had me sit down with them for questioning. After laughing at the accusation, I realized they were serious and told them no and clammed up. After I asked why my dad would put me in front of them with no warning that I was a suspect, like did he think it was me? He said, I think it could have been you. I never did anything illegal like that in my life. For him to think that definitely rocked my relationship with him. Three thirty seven years ago, I was five and had spent two years saving up $10 worth of pennies. I used to count them, 10 pennies in a pile. Ten piles is $1. I kept them in an empty coffee ground can. One day the jar was empty and we had Pizza for dinner. She made me thank her boyfriend for the pizza. 4. I was kicked out of a bar spelling B for spelling a word correctly. The word was Lilliputian like from Gulliver's Travels. I spelled it correctly. They had it without the double L. I showed them I was correct and they still wouldn't let me back in the spelling bee. This was like five years ago. I'm still super bitter. 5. In my junior year of high school, my parents purchased a car for me, but I made all the payments by working 20 hours a week at a local pizzeria. One weekend my mom asked me to take her car 10 minutes into town to the car wash and wash it. I got back about an hour later and my car was gone. They had an offer from someone my dad worked with, so they sold it right out from under me. I never got the money from the sale. 6 during the lockdown, I graduated from college. It was a huge deal. I was the first in my family. They did a zoom ceremony and the presenter accidentally skipped over my name. My family was all watching waiting for them to call my name via live stream and of course the presenter never fucking did. It was just as devastating for them as it was for me. I will never forget my mom saying, I don't understand. Our name should have been there. Our name Ours. I was graduating for us.

So I am brunette right now and my hair is long but from roots to ends I want to be rainbow all over like streaks of every single color Of the rainbow, and I want it all rainbow, so you'd have to lighten me all over.

My husband and I are, we are both very blond, very Nordic looking. And she came out brunette and he thinks that I've been cheating. He's ready to divorce me. I don't know.

Um, that's because color needs color to stick to, and since your hair is so porous and white platinum blond, there is zero color molecules for the color to stick to. So to take you back, we have to essentially go backwards on the rainbow. Um, so I'm gonna have to put, like, a warmer, kind of coppery red color and give your hair color for the brown to stick to.

Um, it will be a clipper cut. Yeah. Um, is it for a little guy or maybe just an older guy that's not here yet? You really need to know his age. Exact age doesn't really matter. It's just kids 10 and under get a discounted price of $21 and anything over that is an adult price. So I just wanted to check. Oh, well, he's an adult like me. So do you have one open today? I sure do. Um, I actually have like the next 55 minutes open. If he's close, is he allowed to bring someone back there with him? Yeah, you know, whenever he gets here, he is more than welcome to have someone accompany with him for his haircut. We do ask that it stays limited to one guest per person though, just cause it's a small building. Great. One second. Hello. Yeah, they have an opening so you can come inside now. By the way, I asked her if I could come back there with you guys while she cuts your hair and she said yes. So, hey, I'm here to get my haircut. I'm with her. Hi. Yeah, I'm gonna be the one doing your hair. Nice to meet you. Why did you hang up on me? Cause we're in the same building. We can talk to each other like face to face.

You flipped the iPad back around and you didn't say anything? Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't even look at that. I try not to pay attention to numbers. I just try to have really one on one conversations with my clients when they're here and not make it all about transactions and gratuity and just. I feel like that stresses a lot of people out. But thank you. Regardless of what you left me, I'm very appreciative. Uh huh. Well, word to the wise, you should pay better attention next time because you were supposed to look at it and say, oh, are you sure? Oh, okay. Um. Did you leave me something larger than intended? What, do we need to fix it? Do we need to do a refund? No, I left you. I left you quite a large tip because I wanted to see if you were just another one of these money hungry hair stylists who was just going to let me severely overpay and let me walk out the door without even telling me. Okay, let me just check here. Uh, you left me two dollars on a 46 dollar haircut? Mm hmm. It wasn't obvious that I was overly generous. You. You just didn't think to say anything. We can return the money. It's. I have no problem giving you back your $2. No, you know what, honey? You keep it because obviously you need it much more than I do. But cancel My future appointments. Because I don't want to be in business with someone who can't be honest with her clients. Especially when they are being so gracious and giving you such good tips. Ma. Okay. I'll get that taken care of for you. Thank you. And you're lucky I don't speak to your boss about this.

Your total is $46. I'm just gonna flip this around. I don't care what you click, but I do need a signature and for you to verify if you want your receipt texted or emailed, because we are paperless. Okay, texting is fine. There you go. Alright, thank you. And, well, it looks like you're a free woman. That's it? There's nothing else that you need to tell me? Nothing you're forgetting? Um, I don't think so. We have your next appointment scheduled. Yeah, I got you your bag and your coat. Oh, product. You asked me about that leave in spray that I used on you earlier. Let me. Oh, it looks like we have one left. It's the 25 benefits spray from Redken. This is one of my favorites. I use it on all of my clients. And it's actually called 25 benefits because it literally has 25 different benefits. Um, if that's what you were talking about, we can go ahead and ring you up again, no problem. That's not it. I might get it next time depending on how this conversation goes. Are you sure there's nothing you're forgetting? I'm really stumped. Um, do you know what I forgot to mention? Is there something that I forgot to mention?

Um, tomorrow I didn't have anyone else other than you and someone in the morning. It was gonna be a full day plus I don't know if you saw the girl that left before you. She used every single 2 of purple and pink that I had in my inventory. So I don't even have the color to do you today nor do I have the time. Just seems like bad business practice not having a color for an appointment that you knew you had. I would have replenished the product to have for your appointment tomorrow, but I wasn't expecting you until tomorrow. Okay, so can you just like reschedule the person who's after Sharon would have been today for after you do Sharon tomorrow? No, I'm sorry. They're getting their hair done for vacation, which they're leaving tomorrow. So either you come tomorrow or we're gonna have to get you in later babe. Is this how you treat a loyal client? We had that time allotted on that day for a reason because that's when I would be able to service you. I can't do your 8 hour appointment in a 2 hour time slot. Fine. I guess I'm not getting my hair done today and I'm gonna have to find a new stylist and you've lost my business forever. Oh, and you're probably gonna have to find someone to fill the slot Tomorrow, because I doubt after I tell my sister how you've treated me that she's going to want to support you anymore either.

Have such a great day. Thank you so much. I'll see you soon. And ugh, I love my hair as usual. Hello. Hi, Karen. How are you? Are you hanging out while I do your sister's hair today? Okay, listen, I fear we may have pulled a parent trap on you. I'm sorry. You two aren't twins. You're just sisters. So what do you mean by that? Here's the deal. I had something at work that I cannot get out of tomorrow. And since Sharon is off today and tomorrow, she was nice enough to switch with me today. So she's gonna be showing up when I'm booked tomorrow and I'm taking her appointment today. That is so sweet of your sister. Um, I just, I wish that y'all would have called me because I would have been able to tell you that I don't have time to do your hair today. She's coming to my appointment tomorrow and I'm at hers today and it works because no one cancelled on you. Yeah, if you two got the same services but you don't. Her hair takes me about two hours to do. So that's how much time I had marked off on the books today. Where is your hair? Takes me about 8 hours to do and that's how much time I had marked off on the books tomorrow. Okay, so can't you just like block off more time?
