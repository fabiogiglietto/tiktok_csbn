I was 17 when I found out about the secret group chat. It happened totally by accident when I was trying to airdrop a funny video to my mom's phone. But when I looked for her device, I saw something called fam real instead of just mom's iPhone. That was weird. So when she left her phone charging in the kitchen later, I checked it out. My stomach dropped when I saw the group members, Mom, Dad, my older brother Jake, my sister Emma, and even Aunt Beth, everyone except me. I scrolled through their messages from that day. They were planning dinner at this new Italian place downtown. Jake had sent a picture of the menu and Emma was joking about how dad always orders the same pasta. Normal family stuff, except I wasn't invited. Then I saw something that made my chest tight. Emma had written, should we tell Natalie about dinner? Mom replied, she'll just complain about the food or say she's too busy. Dad added, let's keep it simple tonight. I kept scrolling back through weeks of messages. There were plans for mini golf, movie nights, even a trip to the zoo, all happening without me. In one conversation, Jake mentioned how they went to see the new Marvel movie. I had asked them about it the next day and they said it was sold out. The worst part was a conversation from Three months ago, Aunt Beth had written, we should probably include Natalie more. Mom's response was, she makes everything awkward. Remember her birthday dinner? Emma chimed in. She complained about the restaurant being too loud the whole time. Jake added, plus, she always has her headphones in. Anyway, my birthday dinner, the one where I wore my favorite dress and actually tried to join their conversations, I thought we had a good time. Apparently, they spent the whole night annoyed with me. I found messages about a family trip to the mountains last winter. They had gone skiing for a whole weekend. When I asked where everyone was, they told me they were visiting grandma. I even texted grandma to see how she was doing, and she seemed confused about why I thought they were there. There were inside jokes I didn't understand, references to things that happened when I wasn't around. Jake had sent a picture of dad wearing Mom's reading glasses and everyone was laughing about it. Emma wrote, classic dad moment, No. 847. I had no idea what that meant. I sat in the dark kitchen reading message after message. They talked about me like I was some annoying neighbour kid, not their daughter and sister. In one thread, they were discussing Christmas plans. Aunt Beth suggested we all go to her cabin, dad wrote. Sounds great, but what about Natalie? Mom replied. We'll figure something out. My hands were shaking as I scrolled to the very Beginning of the chat, it started eight months ago right after my 17th birthday. The first message was from Emma. Finally, we can plan stuff without drama. Jake had replied. Best birthday present ever. I heard footsteps coming toward the kitchen. I quickly closed the phone and pretended to get water from the fridge. Mom walked in and smiled at me like nothing was wrong. Hey, sweetie, how was your day? I wanted to scream. I wanted to show her what I found and ask why they hated me so much. Instead, I just said it was fine and went to my room. That night, I lay in bed thinking about every family moment from the past year. All the times they said plans fell through or events were cancelled. All the times they came home laughing about something and stopped when they saw me. All the times I felt left out and thought I was being paranoid. The next morning at breakfast, they were all acting.

So I'm dating Mitchell. He's 56, I'm 28. And, yes, he's rich. Like, really rich. We met at this Starbucks where I was working on my laptop. He loved that I wasn't trying to get his attention and that I added to my coffee, in his words, more sugar than the Boston Harbor needed in 1773. But here's what six months of dating him actually looks like. Waiters hand him the wine list, never me. His friends, wives talk to me like I'm five, explaining what investment means really slowly. The valet gives Mitchell my car keys every single time. At his country club, someone always asks what I'm studying. I graduated four years ago. Last week, his lawyer asked if I needed help reading the dinner menu. It had seven items on it. Mitchell's company Christmas party is everything I expected and worse. I'm wearing this gorgeous Chanel dress that I bought myself because I liked it. And not even five minutes in, one of the wives pulls me into the bathroom. She puts her hand on my shoulder like she's about to deliver terrible news, and tells me I need to save the money Mitchell gives me for when this ends. When I mention having my own money, she laughs like I've told a joke and presses her friend's financial advisor card into my hand. He specializes in girls like me, apparently. Mitchell gets pulled into a work emergency, Leaving me at the bar, where his car colleagues don't bother lowering their voices. How much do you think Mitchell spends on her monthly? One says, worth every penny at that age. Another answers, cheaper than my boat maintenance. When I approach and mention my startup work, they find it hilarious. One actually asks if Mitchell taught me the word portfolio. Another suggests I'm confusing shopping with investing. Then the boss himself walks over with his champagne and says the most insulting thing yet. When you and Mitchell are done, you should date my son. He's more age appropriate and needs a pretty girl. I say, I don't need anyone to take care of me, but he just pats my head like I'm a golden retriever. We all know what you need, sweetheart. I'm about to tell him exactly what I needed in that moment, when I hear Mitchell's voice from the conference room. The door is cracked open, and he's on speak your phone. Negotiating to buy a tech company. The seller is refusing his 10 million offer, insisting it's worth more, but won't explain why. Mitchell sounds increasingly desperate, repeatedly asking what he's missing. That's when my blood runs cold. I know this company. I know it intimately. I know exactly what Mitchell is missing. I push into the conference room. Before I can stop myself, Mitchell looks up, irritated at the interruption. He tells the seller on the phone, sorry, my girlfriend just wandered in. I'm already scanning The papers spread across the table, confirming what I suspected. The seller's voice crackles through the speaker, asking what's going on. I state simply that the company has three major clients not listed in the disclosure. Mitchell freezes. The seller's voice turns sharp, demanding to know how I could possibly know that. Mitchell starts apologizing for my intrusion, while the CEO appears in the doorway. Mitchell, that's confidential information. You shouldn't be sharing these things. His wife laughs, suggesting I overheard something, and I'm trying to sound smart, but I continue.

So I made sure he saw exactly how much I didn't need him. Uncle Wayne was worth millions but lived like a miser, constantly testing our family to see who was worthy of his money. Every holiday was an audition where cousins would compete for his approval like desperate contestants on a reality show. I'm leaving everything to whoever proves they don't need it, he'd announce at family dinners while everyone kissed his ass and hung on his every word. My cousins would bring him expensive gifts they couldn't afford, offer to clean his house for free, practically beg for his attention and validation. They'd research his interests and pretend to share his hobbies. My cousin Kyle even switched his major to business because Uncle Wayne mentioned he respected entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, I brought nothing and sat in the corner reading a book, completely disinterested in his little power games. He doesn't seem to care about family, he'd say loud enough for me to hear, testing to see if I'd scramble for his approval like the others. You're right, I'd reply without looking up from my book. I don't care about your money either. This always made him pause. While my cousins were falling over themselves to prove their worth, I was actively proving my indifference. While they fought over who could drive him to appointments and grocery shop for him, I got a second job and Started saving every penny. While they argued about his will, I was building my own future. When they'd ask why I never visited Uncle Wayne, I'd say, he has plenty of volunteers. I found his manipulation disgusting. Watching grown adults debase themselves for money made me sick. I'd rather be broke with dignity than rich through desperation. My cousins thought I was crazy. Don't you want financial security? Anna would ask. I'm setting myself up without begging, I'd tell her. While they spent their weekends doing his yard work and running his errands, I was working overtime and taking online courses to improve my skills. While they were buying him birthday presents and Christmas gifts, I was investing in my education and building an emergency fund. The dynamic was fascinating to watch. The more desperate they became for his approval, the more he seemed to enjoy withholding it. The more I ignored him, the more curious he became about me. At family gatherings, he'd try to bait me into conversations about money and success. I'd give polite, brief responses and go back to whatever I was doing. I wasn't rude, but I wasn't performing for him either. Grace, what are your career plans? He'd ask in front of everyone. Working on it, I'd say, simply not elaborating. This drove him crazy because he couldn't figure out my angle. Everyone else was transparent in their attempts to impress him, but I genuinely didn't seem to care about his opinion or his Money, the

My daughter Kayla has this rare condition called cleipol file syndrome. Basically, her neck vertebrae are fused together, which means her neck doesn't move like it should and her head sits weird on her shoulders. The doctors explained that if she ever got hurt and someone tried to move her neck the wrong way, she could become paralyzed or worse. When Kayla was 7, we met with this specialist who laid out all the scary scenarios. Accidents, playground falls, sports injuries. Any first responder or doctor who didn't know about her condition might try to stabilize her neck in a way that could permanently damage her spinal cord. The specialist said we needed to make sure medical personnel would know immediately not to manipulate her neck. He recommended getting a medical alert tattoo right on her upper chest. That would be visible even if she was unconscious. At first I thought he was crazy. Tattoo my seven year old. But then he showed me photos of other kids who'd gotten them for similar conditions. They were small, simple, just the basic medical info in clear black letters. The doctor explained that medical jewellery could get lost or removed during trauma care, but a tattoo would always be there. He connected us with a tattoo artist who specialised in medical tattoos and worked with kids. Guy had done hundreds of these procedures and knew exactly how to make it. As Painless as possible. I talked to Kayla about it, explaining why it was important. She was scared at first, but when I told her it was like getting a special Mark that would keep her safe, she got more interested. The tattoo artist let her pick the font and showed her exactly what it would look like. The actual process took maybe 15 minutes. It was just three lines. Flipple feel syndrome. Do not manipulate neck and see medical I D. Kayla gripped my hand but didn't cry. The artist gave her stickers afterward and told her she was braver than most adults he worked on years. Everything was fine. Kayla's teachers knew about the tattoo, her pediatrician approved of it, and we never had any issues. She actually liked having it because it made her feel special and protected. Then last month, Kayla's school called me to come in for a meeting. I figured it was about her grade.

My grandma has been calling me by my cousin Emma's name for literally 5 years now. Every single time I see her, birthday cards, Christmas presents, family dinners, all addressed to Emma. I'm Jess, by the way. That's my older cousin who lives three states away and visits maybe twice a year. At first I thought it was just an honest mistake. Grandma's 78 and sometimes mixes things up. But then I realised she gets everyone else's names right. My little brother Tyler, my mom, even the mailman she talks to once a week. Just me. She can't remember. The thing that really got to me was last Thanksgiving when she handed me this beautiful hand knitted scarf and said, Happy Thanksgiving, Emma. I made this thinking of you. I thanked her and wore it all day while she told everyone how Emma was doing so well in college. I'm a senior in high school and work at a pizza place after school. My mom always makes excuses for her like, oh, you know how grandma is or she means well, sweetie. But it honestly hurt like I'm so forgettable that my own grandma, who I see every month can't even get my name right. So two weeks ago at Sunday dinner, I decided I'd had enough. Grandma opened the door, she goes, Emma, come give me a hug. And I just smiled and said, hi, Margaret, instead. Of grandma like I always do. She looked confused for a second but didn't say anything. During dinner. When she asked Emma, how's school going, I responded with, I don't know, Margaret. You'd have to ask Emma. I'm doing fine, though. Thanks for asking. My mom shot me a look, but I kept going. When grandma offered me seconds on her fame Miss Mac and cheese, I said, no, thank you, Margaret. I'm good. When she tried to give me leftovers to take home, I said, that's so nice of you, Margaret, but I can't carry all that. By the third Margaret, she stopped mid sentence and stared at me. Why do you keep calling me Margaret? I'm your grandmother. I looked right at her and said, oh, sorry. I thought we were just calling each other by random names, you know, since you've been calling me Emma for the past five years. The whole dinner table went silent. My uncle put down his fork. My mom looked like she wanted to crawl under the table. Tyler was trying not to laugh. Grandma's face went through like 10 different.

I was touching up my lip gloss between clients when I checked the booking system for my next appointment, and my heart literally stopped when I saw the name Amanda Harmon. Two PM, Trim and style. And that last name was ringing every alarm bell in my head, even though I couldn't quite place why it felt so familiar. Amanda walked in looking about seven months pregnant, and she settled into my chair with that exhausted sigh all pregnant women seem to have mastered. She started venting immediately about how her husband, Jeff, never helped with the nursery and how he kept telling her she was being dramatic about morning sickness. My stomach dropped when she said his name. My eyes darted to her left hand where a wedding ring sat, confirming what I didn't want to be true. This was Jeff's wife. The same Jeff who destroyed my sister Elena six years ago when he left her bleeding out in surgery to go be with his mistress. The same Jeff who was updating his relationship status while Elena was losing their baby on the operating table. Amanda kept talking about how unsympathetic Jeff was, completely oblivious to the fact that she was the mistress he'd been texting from the hospital waiting room, the woman he proposed to while my sister was still learning how to walk again. My hands started shaking as I sectioned Amanda's Hair and Megan at the next station caught my eye and mouth, you okay? While her client was checking her phone. I nodded, but she wasn't buying it. So when Amanda's color was processing and she was scrolling through her phone, I pulled Megan into the break room and the words just tumbled out. That's Jeff's wife. You know, the Jeff who almost killed my sister during childbirth and then disappeared to marry his side piece. Megan's eyes went wide and she grabbed my arm saying, wait, the Jeff, the one who told everyone Elena was being dramatic about her pain while she was literally die? That piece of shit actually got someone to marry him. Words spread through the salon faster than bleach lifts dark hair and suddenly the shampoo girl, two other stylists and even our receptionist were huddled in the break room with us. Everyone had opinions because everyone knew Alina story since she still came here for her cuts. Men like that never change, said Tiffany while filing her nails, and she deserves to know the truth came from somewhere in the back. But Linda, our senior stylist who'd been doing hair since 20 years held up her hand and said, we're not ruining a pregnant woman's life today, but that doesn't mean we can't get creative. The group went quiet as we brainstormed and then Maria who usually kept to herself said something, genius girls, what if we help her pick the perfect name? Alina Make that bastard say your sister's name every single day for the rest of his life. The room absolutely exploded with everyone talking over each other. And Tiffany literally squealed while grabbing Maria's hands because it was so perfect. We cuddle together like we were planning a heist. With Linda assigning positions like a general directing troops, she take the station behind mine for backup. Megan would stay next to me for the assist and the receptionist would casually walk by at the perfect moments to really sell it. I returned to Amanda trying to look normal, and she continued complaining about baby names while I trimmed her ends. Jeff shoots down everything I suggest but won't offer anything himself, she said, rolling her eyes in the mirror. That was Megan's cue from the next chair. Oh, I love unique names. Have you considered anything European? They're so sophisticated right now. Our receptionist walked by with towels and casually dropped. My cousin just named her baby Alina and everyone's literally obsessed with how elegant it sounds. I kept my voice steady as I chimed in. Oh.

My 14 year old daughter started asking to sleep over at friends houses every weekend. And I thought it was just normal teenage social stuff. But then I noticed the pattern. Every Monday morning she'd come home looking absolutely destroyed. Dark circles so deep they looked like bruises. Shoulders hunched, dragging her feet like each step hurt. When I asked about the sleepovers, she just mumble it was fun and disappear into her room. Her math teacher emailed saying she'd had a panic attack during class when he'd casually asked about her weekend plans. Her violin teacher called to say she'd quit, just walked out mid lesson without explanation. She lost 10 pounds in just over a month. Her favorite jeans hung loose on her hips. She barely touched breakfast anymore. Started missing Sunday family dinners, events she'd never missed before, not even when she had the flu. My partner thought I was losing it. She's 14, Lisa. Girls have sleepovers. You're being paranoid. But when I was cleaning her room, I found energy drink cans stuffed behind her dresser, dozens of them. My sweet girl who used to drink nothing but herbal tea, my mom instant. It wasn't just whispering anymore, they were screaming. I started watching her more carefully. She'd get text on Friday afternoon and her whole body would change. Shoulders would tense up, face would go pale, hands would start trembling as she packed always the same overnight bag, but I noticed something odd. Work gloves sticking out of the side pocket. No more family game nights on Saturdays. No more baking cookies together on Sunday mornings. No more asking me to braid her hair before bed. It was like she was being pulled away from us by some invisible force. One day I was passing her room when I heard on the phone, her voice was different, scared, desperate almost. I know, I know I'll be there, her voice cracked. I can't do this every weekend anymore. Please pause. No, I understand. I promise I won't tell anyone. Then I heard her crying, real gut wrenching sobs that made my chest tighten. The next morning at breakfast, I asked casually, which friend's house are you going to tonight, honey? Her spoon clattered into her cereal bowl. Her eyes farted to her phone like it might save her. Just, just Marlene's. Her mom already said yes. But I called Marlene's mom last week. Marlene had been at her dad's house in another state for the past month. That's when I really started noticing her phone behaviour. When a specific notification sound played, just two quick beeps, her entire body would go rigid. Then she'd immediately delete whatever she'd seen. Something was very, very wrong with my daughter. I waited until she left for her sleepover that Saturday night. Then I did something I'd sworn I'd never do. I followed her. She didn't walk like a teenager heading to a fun Sleepover. She walked like someone heading to their execution, taking a weird winding route through the neighborhood, doubling back twice, constantly checking over her shoulder. At one point, she stopped completely, stood under a streetlight, and I watched her take deep, shuddering breaths like she was preparing for battle. She pulled out her phone and typed something. Even from my car, I could see her hands shaking as she hit send. The response must have been immediate because her shoulders slumped in defeat. Then she kept walking. What I discovered made my stomach drop to the floor. She didn't go.

For bringing my roommate's wallet to dinner without telling her. My roommate Kate has this incredible superpower of she can selectively forget her wallet every single time we go somewhere that cost money. But somehow she never forgets it when she's going shopping alone or getting her nails done. We've been living together for eight months, and I've been keeping track. She's forgotten her wallet 17 times. 17! And every single time, she gives me this look like I'm supposed to cover her because I have a corporate job and she's a freelance artist. Last Tuesday, she comes bouncing into our apartment with this huge grin. Guess what? I booked us a table at Meridian for my birthday dinner Friday night. I invited Jessica, Mike, and L, Too. Meridian, the place where appetizers start at $35. I knew exactly what was coming. This was going to be her biggest scam yet. Order expensive food for everyone on her special day, then conveniently forget her wallet and guilt everyone else into splitting the massive Bill. Friday night arrives. She's getting ready, humming some Taylor Swift song, completely in her element. I'm watching from my doorway as she does her usual routine. Phone, check. Keys, check. Lipstick, check. Tiny purse, check. She even did that fake little gasp and snap, like, got everything. As if to seal the performance. But there it was, her wallet, sitting in plain sight on the nightstand, once again mysteriously excluded from the essentials. It was like, Watching someone rehearse a scam she's pulled off a dozen times. Wallet sitting on nightstand, ignored. I'm just going to touch up my mascara real quick. She calls out, heading to the bathroom. That's when I made my move. I slipped into her room and grabbed the wallet. Black leather. Kind of heavy, actually. I could feel credit cards and cash inside. We meet everyone at the restaurant. Meridian has this whole upscale vibe. Dim lighting, fancy cloth napkins. Haters in actual uniforms. Kate is in full birthday girl mode, telling everyone to order whatever they want. It's my special day. Go crazy. Jessica orders a forty dollar salmon. Mike gets the fifty five dollar steak. L goes for the lamb, which is like sixty dollars. Kate orders the seafood tower for herself. Eighty five dollars. We're laughing, having a good time, taking birthday photos. Kate is being the perfect hostess. Then the check comes. $230. Kate looks at it and starts patting down her tiny purse. Checking her jacket pockets, looking under the table.

In my family, we had something called Health Day. Every Saturday morning at 9:00am sharp. We'd finish breakfast and dad would already have the basement ready with his white coat on and all his medical equipment laid out on metal trays in the basement. Our mom would kiss our foreheads before sending us down one by one. Then came the examinations, thorough inspections of every inch of our bodies while he muttered medical terms and scribbled and thick glue binders. He'd make us stand naked under the bright lights while he circled us slowly, his gloved fingers pressing into our skin, checking what he called abnormalities. He called it preventive care. I dreaded it. Every single week. The rule was you couldn't flinch or complain or you'd start over from the beginning. The strangest part, we weren't allowed to mention health day at school, not to teachers, not to friends. I only realised in middle school how weird that was, how other kids just went to pediatricians once a year, not secret basement clinics every week. But the worst part was the special examinations. If dad found something concerning during the regular check, you'd get called down on weeknights. He had this small locked room with bright lights and an table with stirrups. The metal was always cold and he'd spend what felt like hours with his instruments documenting every detail while telling us to relax and breathe. He said it was for Comprehensive assessment. The kid, I was terrified. I'd count the ceiling tiles over and over. But dad said fear meant you were taking your health seriously. When I got older, I started questioning everything. Why did we need weekly exams when no one else did? Why did mom drink before every health day? I remember once at 14, I asked if I could skip it for Rachel's sleepover. Dad gripped my wrist and stared at me with these desperate eyes. Health day is the only thing keeping you safe, he said. That's when I knew something was deeply wrong. Rachel's family had annual checkups, vaccinations, schedules, growth charts on the fridge. No basement procedures, no locked rooms, no binders documenting their bodies, just normal healthcare. I finally refused to go downstairs when I turned 16. Dad went ballistic, screaming that I was ungrateful and didn't understand the dangers. Mom just stood there shaking. He locked me in my room and said I couldn't leave until I submitted to a full examination. The next morning, mom slipped me $20 under the door and whispered to use the window. When I came back that night, dad acted like nothing had happened. He just asked if I was ready for my examination like he hadn't imprisoned me the night before. That's when I started planning. Still, the whole thing ate at me. Why was dad so obsessed with our health when he wasn't even a doctor? Where did he get all that equipment? Three months later, I told my health teacher everything. Missus Patterson kept her face very still as I explained our Saturday routine. She said she needed to make a phone call. I knew what that meant. She came back with the principal. Then the police came, then Child Services. They took us out of class one by one, just like health day, except this time, we didn't go home. I'll never forget Dad's face when they arrested him. Not angry, just broken. I was protecting them, he kept saying. The officers found the binders, dozens.

I was a court reporter when a seven year old had a meltdown during his parents custody hearing, and their reactions revealed everything the judge needed to know. The Hendersons had been fighting over custody of little Nathan for six months. Mom Susan arrived in a sharp business suit with her attorney, talking loudly about her promotion and new condo. Dad Tom look tired in his work clothes, having come straight from his construction job to make the two PM hearing. Susan's case seems strong. Higher income, stable housing, private school enrollment. Already arranged. Your honor. I can provide Nathan with opportunities his father simply cannot afford. Piano lessons, tutoring, summer camps. Tom's lawyer did his best, but the numbers didn't lie. Tom worked long hours for half Susan's salary and lived in a modest apartment. When asked about extracurriculars, Tom quietly said, I help with his homework every night and we go to the park on weekends. Midway through Susan's testimony about her comprehensive parenting plan, Nathan started fidgeting in the gallery where he'd been sitting with a social worker. The seven year old had been silent for an hour, but suddenly stood up and said loudly, I need to use the bathroom. The social worker started to get up, but before she could react, both parents moved. What happened next lasted maybe 10 seconds, but it changed everything. Susan snapped, Nathan, sit down. We're in the middle of Something important. You should have gone before we came in here. She didn't even turn around fully, just shot him an annoyed look over her shoulder. Tom immediately stood up, walked over to Nathan, and knelt down to his eye level. Hey, buddy, of course you can go. Let's go right now. He took Nathan's hand naturally, like he'd done it a thousand times. I don't want to interrupt the important meeting, Nathan whispered, clearly anxious. You're not interrupting anything, Tom said softly. You're the most important thing here. As they walked toward the door, Nathan suddenly stopped and burst into tears. Not bathroom urgency tears. The big, overwhelming sobs of a stressed seven year old who'd been holding it together too long. Susan's reaction was to look at her watch and whisper urgently to her lawyer about the delay. She kept glancing at the door like their son's breakdown was an inconvenience to her testimony. Tom just picked Nathan up and held him, not caring that his son's tears were soaking his work shirt. He didn't try to stop the crying or rush him through it. He just stood there rubbing his back, whispering, it's okay, buddy. Take your time. When Nathan finally calmed down enough to whisper something in his dad's ear, Tom nodded and carried him back into the courtroom. Your honor, Nathan would like to tell you something, if that's okay. The judge A mother herself, not a jet.

My husband and I had just finished watching Batman with our six year old daughter when she innocently said, Riddle me this daddy, who is 41 but looks like a 200 year old witch. We both stopped dead in our tracks. But before we could get a word out, she clapped her hands and said, Mommy does. Mommy looks like a 200 year old witch. My face went pale and I proceeded to nervously laugh before putting her to bed. But when I came back out to my husband, I broke down. You see, I couldn't even be mad at my daughter for saying that she was right. Despite being in my early 40s, I full on looked like a wrinkly old worm. My forehead had wrinkles, my cheeks had wrinkles. Even my wrinkles had wrinkles. My husband held me while I cried all night, kissing my forehead and reassuring me I was beautiful and saying that even if I was a witch, I'd be the prettiest witch in town. That made me cry even harder. The next day I still wasn't over my daughter's comment. So I decided to do something rash. I visited a plastic surgeon. I, I knew I couldn't be helped. When he started recommending the best procedures for women 60 and older, I wanted to cry. And I'll never forget his face when I told him I was 41. He cleared His throat and proceeded to start telling me that Botox was my only solution. It sounded like a good idea at first until I realised I'd be paying $1,200 to look plastic and unnatural. I thought more about it, decided I didn't want to risk looking like a botched surgery. Thanks the doctor for his time before leaving. I came home feeling crushed and my daughter asking me if I just came back from evil potion making class just made me feel worse. That night, I scoured the internet trying to find something that would make me look younger. I didn't even care about looking 30 again. I just wanted to look my age. But instead of that, I found something even better. The day my new package arrived, I was ecstatic, tore it open, read the instruction manual. That's a lie. I threw it out without even looking and started using it right away. I remember my husband was at work that day and when he came home, he told me I was glowing more than usual. I felt so over the moon, I can't even describe it. I told him the reason and he just dropped his jaw in disbelief. He called me a genius and said this secret of mine needs to be protected forever. I just giggled like a schoolgirl in response. Fast forward one month, I was feeling on top of the world and the day my daughter asked if I was making young person Potions in my witch classes. I knew I was doing something very right. Another two months went by and by this point, I wasn't just looking my age. My face made me look like I was in my 20s again. Was finally looking like the hot mom I had always dreamed of being. My husband couldn't keep his hands off me and my daughter now resorted to making jokes about Mommy looking like a model, which made me honestly tear up every time I heard it. I remember some woman at work actually asked me what I was studying in college. And when I told her I was over 40, she looked like she had seen a ghost. She told me on the spot that she needed to know my secret. So what was my secret? Sunscreen. That's right, growth factor sunscreen. I wore it on my face every day for three months and it literally reversed my aging. Here is my before and after.

So I cut off the host. When I was 19, I started a lawn care business to pay for college. Nothing fancy, just me, a beat up truck and a borrowed mower. By senior year, I had 12 regular clients pulling in around $2,000 a month. My little sister Lily was 14 when she started begging to help during summers. Please let me work with you. All my friends make minimum wage at target, but you're making actual money. So I started bringing her along, paying her $200 a week for being my assistant. She'd water flower beds, organize tools and keep me company. Those were some of my favourite memories. Jamming to music between houses, splitting gas station snacks for telling me about high school drama. Clients loved her, too. Mrs. Carter even requested Lily specifically for her prize roses. I was proud watching her develop work ethic and people skills. Fast forward three years, I graduated and moved back home temporarily while transitioning into full landscaping. I had contracts lined up, equipment financing approved. This was my launchpad into real entrepreneurship. That's when Lily's attitude flipped. Great, the college graduate is back living like a teenager. She denounced to her friends, four years of college just to end up cutting grass in mommy's basement. It escalated quickly. She started posting TikToks calling me a failure who couldn't make it in the real world while showing off Luxury halls, designer makeup, expect expensive clothes, AirPods, Pro, all funded by money I've been paying her. My brother thinks he's some big entrepreneur, she'd say online, but he's literally still living at home like a child. The comments were brutal. Your brother sounds like a loser and why don't your parents kick out? Meanwhile, I was working 12 hour days building the business. But according to Lily's social media, I was just a basement dwelling failure. The breaking point came at our family barbecue. I was networking with my dad's coworker, Jason, who owned three office complexes downtown. We were discussing a potential commercial landscaping contract, $50,000 annually. Your operation sounds impressive, Jason was saying. I've been looking for someone reliable for both maintenance and seasonal plantings. That's when Lily walked over with her signature smirk. Oh, you're talking to my brother. Fair warning, he's kind of a parasite. Still lives at home, can't support himself, always asking my parents for money. I watched Jason's expression change. The professional interest died. I replaced by awkward politeness. Well, uh, maybe we can discuss this another time, he said, making a quick excuse to leave. $50,000 gone. That Monday, Lily texted her usual. Can you pick me up from school and can I work this week? I need $400 for homecoming dress shopping. I stared at that text, remembering Jason walking away, remembering the TikTok's comments call.

At my school, it was Marcus Chen. Everyone just knew he was going to make it big someday. He was the kind of guy people pointed to and said, that one, he's going places. Captain of the basketball team, straight a student and somehow still the most grounded, humble person you'd ever meet. What made Marcus legendary wasn't just his skills on the court, it was how he treated people. He wasn't just admired, he was respected. Genuinely. The guy knew everyone's name. Not in a fake politician way either. He remembered little things. If you mentioned your grandma was sick and passing, he'd ask how she was doing a week later. If you were struggling in class, he'd sit with you at lunch walking you through the assignment like it was no big deal. He made you feel like you mattered. Then came senior year and with it something none of us expected. Mr Patel, our math teacher, was diagnosed with cancer. He was one of those rare teachers everyone liked. Strict but fair, always willing to help, even if it meant staying late. Found out his insurance wouldn't cover the experimental treatment he needed. Words spread quickly. The mood at school changed overnight. Everyone felt it. The very next morning, Marcus got on the PA system, calm and direct. This Saturday, we're hosting a charity basketball tournament. $5 to watch, 20 to play. All proceeds go to Mister Patell's treatment. Bring Your friends, let's pack the gym. No Pep rally, no posters, just that message. And somehow it worked better than any hype machine. The buzz was instant. Saturday came and the turnout was beyond anything we expect. Did not only did our entire school show up, but students from three neighboring schools came, too. Some brought their families. Local businesses chipped in with food, raffle prizes and donations. One restaurant matched every dollar raised. The gym was packed wall to wall. Teams played from morning until night and nobody wanted to leave. By the end of the weekend, we had raised over $15,000. I'll never forget the look on Mister Patell's face when Marcus handed him the envelope. He didn't say anything at first, just hugged Marcus tight, eyes full of tears. And Marcus just smiled and said, we're all behind you, sir. It felt like a perfect ending, but there was more. A few weeks later, words started.

I spent 15 years building the internet infrastructure for our small town in Nebraska. Everyone knew me as the internet guy. When your Wi-Fi went down at 2:00am, you called me. When you wanted faster speeds for your home office, I was your guy. What most people didn't know was that I didn't work for some big company. I owned every cable, every tower and every router box in town. I was the provider. Everything started falling apart when Jerry Davidson got elected to City Council. This guy had been gunning for me ever since I refused to give him free internet for his campaign office two years earlier. At the first town meeting, Jerry stood up with this big presentation about bringing in competition. We need options, he said, pointing at charts showing how much cheaper national providers were. Alex has had a monopoly too long. The new company, Net Connect, rolled into town with promises nobody could refuse, half the price, double the speeds, and a name people recognized from TV commercials. They set up a booth at the farmers market offering gift cards just for signing up. Within three months, I watched my customer base get cut in half. By six months, I had maybe 30 customers left out of 800. People stopped waving when they saw me around town. Mrs. Henderson, who used to bring me cookies every Christmas, wouldn't even make eye contact at the grocery store. At Pete's Diner, conversations would stop when I walked in. Some people actually laughed when Jerry made jokes about my outdated service during council meetings. I tried everything. Lowered my prices below cost, offered free installation, threw in premium channels. Nothing worked. Net Connect had poisoned the well. My savings account hit zero. My girlfriend Katie left me for some guy who worked at the bank. My business was circling the drain and I was three months behind on my truck payment. That's when I started reading contracts real carefully. See, Net Connect had signed a deal with the city to run their fiber cables through existing infrastructure. They were using my utility poles, my access boxes, and most importantly, my signal towers. The contract gave them access, but only if I granted maintenance permissions. Gary had been so excited to stick it to me that he never bothered reading the fine print. When the city originally gave me exclusive rights to install towers 15 years ago, I wrote a clause that let me shut down signal access with 60 days notice. Back then, it seemed like a smart way to protect my investment. Now it was my nuclear option. I spent three nights going through every page of every contract. Netconnect's infrastructure piggybacked completely on my original network backbone. They never laid fresh lines because it would have cost million.

I can't really explain it, to be honest with you. I mean, she's just, she's, she's so beautiful. My God, she's so smart. I would just, I would, I feel like I would do anything for her.

I was the first person in my family to go to college. My dad worked construction, my mom cleaned houses, and my little brother Jake gave up his bedroom so I could have a quiet space to study. When I got my acceptance letter to State University, I ran through the house screaming that I got a full scholarship. I didn't. I got partial aid that covered about 60%. The rest would be $28,000. My first year alone, I stood in the financial aid office staring at those numbers, knowing my parents would take out loans they couldn't afford or call every distant relative begging for help. They'd already sacrificed so much. So I walked to the student loan office down the hall and signed papers for a private loan. I told myself I'd pay it back on my own after graduation. Easy. The first payment came due six months later while I was still in school, $240 a month. I got a job shelving books at the campus library for $8 an hour and picked up tutoring sessions for kids who struggled with math. Between classes, I'd run to work. Between work, I tutor until midnight. My parents called every Sunday asking how my scholarship was going. I told them it was great. My mom would cry happy tears talking about how proud she was that her smart daughter got everything paid for. Every month I made that payment, sometimes I'd eat nothing. But ramen noodles for three weeks straight. When my roommates went out for pizza, I'd say I wasn't hungry. When they asked why I worked so many hours with a full ride, I joked that I was saving up for something special. By graduation, the debt had grown to $53,000. Interest kept piling on top of interest. I still said nothing. I got a job in marketing in Chicago and moved to the smallest studio apartment I could find, was basically a closet with a hot plate. But rent was only 800 a month. My parents visited once and asked why I lived somewhere so tiny when I made decent money. I told them I was being responsible and saving for a house. Really, I was drowning. Every single month I transfer money to that loan. I walked 40 minutes to work instead of taking the bus. I bought clothes from thrift stores and told people I was into vintage fashion. I never went to movies or bars. When co workers invited me out, I'd make excuses about being tired or having plans. My friends thought I was incredibly disciplined. They joke about my monk like lifestyle and ask for budgeting advice. If only they knew I was living on peanut butter sandwiches and splitting single meals into two days of food. The worst part was lying to my family. When Jake started applying to colleges, he'd call asking for advice about scholarships. I'd help him with applications while knowing His chances were slim. When my parents mentioned how expensive college was getting, I'd nod and agree while making another payment on my secret debt. Five years passed.

You're not. Why aren't you ready? Well, to be completely honest, I'm kind of broke. That first date kind of tapped me out, and I'm trying to save up enough money to take her on a second date. Oh, no, dude. Levi. Oh, man. Why are you paying for all this expensive stuff if you don't have the funds to do that? Like buying her the makeup and the shoes? Oh, she told you about all that stuff, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we talked to her about your date. She said you guys went to a really nice dinner, and then afterwards you took her to the mall and you were like, throw it in the bag, girl. Whatever. No, look, it's not really a big deal. Guys, I got a second. Um, I got a. I'm. I'm driving for Uber now, and so between that and my real job, I really think that, you know, it's gonna be easy to take her on dates like that. I just wasn't planning ahead cause I didn't know I was gonna meet her, you know? Did you say you just got a job? Wait, Levi, you took a second job in order to take Cassie out again? Yeah. Oh, man, that is so sweet and so wrong all at the same time. Yeah, no, it's not right. I mean, look, let's be honest. What's money for if not to, like, spend it on people you like? Sounds like money for you. Should be to save it, but yeah. You realize when you go out on a date, you don't have to break the bank, right? Well, you don't know Cassie, but she's definitely worth breaking the bank. I mean, I'd even rob a bank. Not a big bank, like a small bank. Not a big bank, but a medium sized bank. That's illegal, but sweet. Yeah. If you don't have the bank, don't spend it. No, no, I get that. It's just. I think today, nowadays it's just a nice concept to be able to take somebody out. And if I'm the one asking them out, I wanna be the one who can, like, you know, make it a date. Okay, I agree with you there. I do. I think that if you're the one that's asking, then you should be the one that treat. But she likes you for a lot of reasons. And there's a lot of other less expensive date options than taking them to the mall. Like, you could go, I don't know, to coffee man. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. In the dating climate nowadays, I think too many guys are content just being, you know, typical. And I wanted to wow her. And I still want to wow her on our next date. That's the point.

I'm married. I'm very happily, very happily married. You are not obviously very happily married if you're on a dating website going out on dates that you refuse to call dates. Like I promise you that my wife and I are very much in love and I'm not cheating. Like I don't kiss any of these girls. I don't hook up with them. You just lonely or something and you want companionship when your wife's at work or something. Like what's. No, So my wife and I, our five year is coming up, right? Your five year anniversary. Yeah, yeah, our five year anniversary. So I had this whole idea that I wanted to do this big surprise for her where basically I've been going out and I've been taking dancing lessons with different women and these girls are helping me practice. Essentially they're like dancing partners. You are so full of crap. I can't even believe it. You're trying to tell us that you're just learning how to dance by being on a dating website. It's kind of smart. Yeah, you're such a, oh my God, I wanna cuss so bad. Honestly, it's the truth. Look, I mean, I start talking to these girls, whatever we, if it's, I only go with people that I think I would have a good time with. And then, you know, we go out, we dance and half the time I even tell them What I'm up to, you know, so why half the time, why not tell everybody? Why not just go, hey, I need a partner to dance with cause I wanna learn to dance for my wife for anniversary. Yeah, because it's about my wife. It's not about like bringing somebody else in on the thing. You know, like I'm not trying to like include some girl in like my five year thing. Why are you on a dating website? Oh my god. I'm so frustrated. Because it's an easy way to meet people. It's people who are willing to go out and have fun. They're, they wanna engage with somebody. And, you know, like I could put up some ad on Craigslist, but I might get some creep or some, you know, weirdo. What are you talking about? You can go to a dancing studio, yo, and they find a partner for you. I've been to classes before where they have an odd number of people and I just end up standing in the corner like dancing by myself. So would you say it's accurate that you're faking going on dates then? No, because I don't think that there's anything that I'm doing on the date that is anything that would like lead these girls to believe that there's like a romantic thing. Yes. So every person on a dating website thinks that there's going to be a romantic thing. That's why they're on the dating website. Dude, look. I'm telling you, these girls have really fun times. I have a really fun time. I'm not a jerk. I don't treat them poorly. And in my opinion, I think what I'm doing is way better than what most of these guys are doing on these apps and on this stuff anyway, where they're just trying to get hookups. Like on my profile too, it doesn't say I'm looking for a relationship. It says I'm just looking to have fun. So what should I tell Denise then? Like, oh, hey, sorry, he's married. If you're gonna talk to her, I would hope that you would include that. I thought she was really great and I hope that she can, you know, I'm sure she's gonna find a really great guy because she was really cool. Well, you know, you could actually talk to her because she's actually on the phone listening.

Now that I've started dating someone else, she wants to add more rules. Two and a half years ago, my wife Sarah dropped a nuke over morning coffee. I want an open marriage, she said, not even looking up from her phone. Either we do this or we get divorced. I nearly choked on my cereal. We have two young kids and divorce sounded like a nightmare. After a week of thinking, I agreed, but only with strict rule. No mutual friends, no bringing dates to our house and we keep everything private. For the next two years, Sarah thrived while I buried myself in work. I was pulling 74 hour weeks, coming home exhausted just to hear her humming in the shower after her dates. I moved to the guest room because the thought of her with other men then sleeping next to me made me feel legally ill. Our marriage became purely transactional. We were roommates, raising kids together, nothing more. Sarah would leave for her adventures while I helped with homework and made dinner. I didn't even try dating. This past summer, everything changed. I finally hit every financial goal I'd said. Both kids had fully funded college accounts. Our house was paid off, zero debt. I did the math, realized I could cut my work hours from 74 to just 30 per week. Sarah's reaction was immediate, perfect. Now we can buy that bigger house I've been wanting. I saw this BMW. Absolutely not. I said I'm not going back into debt. She looked at me like I'd grown a second head. For years, I'd been the workaholic provider while she played. I spent that summer transforming myself, renovated our basement into an amazing man cave with a home theater and bar, started hitting the gym daily, joined a recreational basketball league, took my oldest son on a cross country road trip. For the first time in years, I felt alive. Then I decided to actually try dating. I'm not a casual hook up guy. I need connection, friendship, shared interests. After a few mediocre dates, I met Jane at a coffee shop. She was reading this same graphic novel I had in my bag. Jane was incredible. We'd spend hours at art galleries, go to concerts, binge watch SCI fi shows and debate philosophy, overwine. The chemistry was electric. But more than that, she genuinely cared about my thoughts and dreams. With her, I remembered who I used to be before I became just Sarah's wallet and the kids driver. That's when Sarah started getting weird. So who is this Jane person? She'd ask casually while folding laundry, not discussing it. I'd reply just like she'd done for two years, come on, I just wanna know. Remember when I asked about your dates? You said it was none of.

But that's what makes the friendship solid. We fight, we argue, we roast each other for sport, and two minutes later we're planning What to eat? Like nothing even happened. That's real friendship. Constant drama over nonsense. But deep down, you know you'd ride for each other anytime.

But when he threw it in my face, I felt a crack open inside me, as if behind that laughter there was icy contempt, a refusal to take me seriously. He thought I'd laugh with him, but hell, nah. So I chose to tear away from him what he thought was untouchable, his grandfather. The old man was guilty of nothing except existing in his lineage and having this little bastard with him. His wrinkled skin, his fragile breath, he embodied innocence. And that's precisely what made my act more cruel. I took it, I destroyed it, piece by piece, until only a suffocating silence remained. And then the unthinkable happened. Like a curse born of my actions, his body began to swell, to swell with an alien life. The grandfather, despite his age, now carried within him an impossible pregnancy, an abomination, a cursed child conceived in pain and despair. When his grandson discovered what was happening, his eyes filled with horror. I looked him straight in the eyes and whispered, did you wanna laugh? Look, now your grandfather carries within him the proof of my vengeance. And that laughter will haunt you until your death. That day, he understood that some jokes are worth more than a Smile. They breed monsters.

Then place a dead animal 4 feet above it. This way, if a police dog smells something unusual, they will only find the dead animal. If you want to get rid of a crime weapon, the best way to do it is to melt it down into a block of steel, then throw it in the ocean. This way it will sink to the bottom and if someone finds it, they will never know what it originally was. If you want to trespass onto someone's property, bring a dog leash with you. If someone asks why you're there, just tell them your dog ran off and you're trying to find it. If your grandmother is racist, create a photo montage of your brother or sister in a situation that will upset her. She will remove them from her will so you will inherit a larger share.

Yeah, like an hour ago. Why? He dropped to his knees right there on the kitchen floor. For a second, I thought he was joking, but then he started dry heaving into the sink. She ate it. The whole thing. His voice cracked. He ran out to the bathroom, slamming the door. That's when Delilah burst through the front door, still in her dental hygiene scrubs. She must have left work early. Where's Killian? She asked, breathless. He texted to call 9 1 1 and something about you eating the last slice. Delilah pounded on the bathroom door. Killian, baby, what's wrong? He came out, eyes red, and showed her something. Delilah's face went from worried to devastated in seconds. Now. Oh, she whispered. No, no, no. My phone buzzed. It was our landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry. Rent can wait this month. My stomach cramped suddenly, sharp enough to double me over the chocolate cake. Another wave of nausea hit, and I barely made it to the kitchen kitchen sink. My roommate Damien rubbed my back, which was so out of character, I'd have laughed if I wasn't puking. She's been waiting two years to eat that cake, Killian muttered, looking at Delilah, who was now sitting on the floor, crying her eyes out. Two years for what? I gasped between heaves. Nobody answered. My phone rang. It was my mom. Hey, I'm So disappointed in you. How could you do this? She hung up before I could ask what she was talking about. We need to go to the hospital, Killian said. Now. What? Why? It's just food poisoning. Delilah stood up, her face pale. It's not food poisoning. Please, just trust me. We need to go now. Killian was already grabbing his keys. The cramping was getting worse. In the car, Delilah wouldn't even look at me. Killian kept checking his phone and wincing at whatever he saw. What was in that cake? I asked again, starting to panic. The pain was spreading. Delilah finally spoke, her voice hollow. My future just. We'll deal with it at the hospital, Killian said. At the ER, Killian ran ahead to talk to the intake nurse. I couldn't hear what he was saying, but she looked shocked and waved us through immediately. That's when I knew something was really, really wrong. Delilah looked like she might cry or scream or both. A doctor appeared with a portable X ray machine. We need to check your stomach contents immediately. For food poisoning? He exchanged a look with Killian and Delilah. Not exactly. Let's just see what we find. A nurse started prepping an IV. Any allergy Jeez I should know about? She asked. Medications? Latex. She paused, looking at her clipboard. Reactions to platinum or white? Gold. No, I answered, completely confused. They made everyone leave the room while they X rayed my abdomen. The Doctor studied the image on his tablet, zooming in on something. Killian's mom appeared in the doorway. She looked at me like I'd killed her dog. Is it still intact? She asked the doctor. It's been in my family for 90 years. The room went silent except for the beeping machines. Delilah finally looked at me, her face a mask of controlled rage. There's definitely a metallic object in your stomach, he whispered. I stared at him. A what? Delilah's face went red with anger. You ate my engagement ring. I what? Killian cleared his throat. I hid Grandma's ring in your favorite cake. I was going to propose. That was my cake from my boyfriend for our anniversary. It was on the middle shelf. The words tumbled out as my brain tried to catch up. That's the communal shelf. Everyone knows that. I was saving it for tonight. Delilah's voice rose. You. You literally have your own shelf. Your name is on it in purple Sharpie. My stomach gurgled again. The ring was in there, supposedly worth thousands of dollars. Floating around with a chocolate cake I thought was communal property. The doctor handed me a bottle of thick white liquid. This should speed things along.

This is why I label everything, even my water bottles now. Next. Time, I told Killian as another cramp hit. Maybe just use a ring box like a normal person. There won't be a next time. Delilah screamed. The doctor cleared his throat. Well, this is certainly going to be an insurance nightmare, destroying property worth thousands. You're a thief. Killian's mom's fat. Delilah wiped her tears. Your type always takes what isn't theirs. As I sat there with the laxatives, I remembered something. Something that would make them regret how they treated me. I reached for my phone in my pocket and pulled out the photo gallery, scrolling back to yesterday afternoon. There it was, the chocolate cake, sitting right on the middle shelf of our fridge, with my handwritten note taped to the white bakery box that said Happy Anniversary, Brandon. Love me in blue pen. I turned the screen toward them and watch their faces change. Killian went white first, then his mom, then Delilah, who grabbed the phone from my hand to look closer. The time stamp showed three forty seven PM yesterday, clear as day. Killian started opening and close, closing his mouth like a fish, trying to find words that wouldn't come out. He finally managed to stammer about how Delilah had mentioned wanting chocolate cake last week and he just assumed when he saw it. His mom snatched my phone from Delilah's hands, holding it close to her face and squinting at the screen. Her jaw tightened when she saw the time stamp and The note with my

I smiled because they didn't realize the biggest house on the lake would have my name on it. The text popped up on my phone at 7:00am while I was sipping burnt office coffee. Nora, it's going to be too full this year at the cabin with your sister's kids and your cousin bringing his fiance. There just isn't space. Maybe next summer. The words stung, but I forced a smile. No problem, mom. Hope you all have fun. I'm the reliable daughter who gets skip over for everything. My sister Claire is the golden one. Two kids, doting husband, perfect Instagram life. Me, divorced, focused on my architecture career. Apparently the least exciting person at family barbecues. What mom didn't know was that five months earlier, I'd been handed a secret that changed everything. Last February, while cleaning out my late Uncle George's files, the lawyer slid a slim folder across the table. He left something just for you, he said. Inside was a deed. A waterfront lot directly across from the family's precious lakehouse. Uncle George bought it 30 years ago, the lawyer explained. He always said you were the only one who truly appreciated the lake. I remember my hands shaking as I signed the transfer paper. For once, someone had seen me. By April, I'd hired a builder named David to break ground. We'll have framing up by mid June, he promised. Hard hat tilted back. Every Morning before work, I'd stop by the site. The smell of fresh cut cedar and the rumble of trucks drowned out memories of summers where I was told to sleep on the pull out couch while Claire got the loft bedroom with lake views. Two weeks later, mom texted again Claire's bringing extra toys this summer. Do you mind if we store them in your old room? I didn't reply. Instead, I looked across the water where David's crew was hammering beams into place. My house, modern glass fronted with a wrap around porch, was rising higher every day in July. Claire called Nora, Mom said you're skipping the cabin. The twins will miss you. I've got project.

When I was 16, my parents went out of town for their anniversary weekend, leaving me home alone for the first time. My older brother Jake was supposed to check on me, but he was away at college. I was actually excited to have the house to myself. Saturday night around ten PM, I was in my pajamas watching Netflix when I heard our back door open. I figured it was my brother coming to check on me like he'd promised, so I called out, Jake, is that you? No answer. I muted the TV and listened. Footsteps in the kitchen, but they were too quiet, too careful. Jake would have just yelled back or come straight to the living room. These footsteps were deliberately trying to be silent. My heart started pounding. I grabbed my phone and crept toward the kitchen, thinking maybe I should call 9 1 1. As I got closer, I heard a voice I recognized. She's definitely here. Her car is in the driveway and all the lights are on. It was my brother's best friend, Marcus. He'd been coming to our house since middle school, practically lived here during high school. I'd known him for years. Then I heard another voice. You sure her parents aren't coming back tonight? Positive. They're three hours away at some fancy resort, and Jake's not coming home until Sunday. I froze. Why was Marcus here with someone else? And why were they talking? About my parents schedule. I heard Marcus again. I've been planning this for months. Every time I'm over here, I've been figuring out the layout, where her room is when she's usually alone. Tonight's perfect. My blood turned to ice. Marcus, who'd eaten dinner at our table hundreds of times, who my parents trusted completely, who Jake considered his best friend, had been planning something. The other voice said, what if she screams? She won't. She trust me. I'll just tell her I came to check on her like Jake asked. By the time she realizes what's happening, it'll be too late. I was shaking so hard, I could barely hold my phone. I had maybe 30 seconds before they came looking for me. The front door was too far, and they'd hear me running. I was trapped.

You have no rights. She forgot the house was built on land with a 99 year lease that expires next month. Jennifer ended our marriage Thursday night with ice cold precision. I'm done, David. I want a divorce. I've already talked to my lawyer. Then she delivered what she thought was the killing blow. I'll be keeping the house and everything in it. You need to pack your stuff and be gone by Sunday. The house, Jen, we've lived here for eight years, built our whole life here. Don't be stupid, she sneered. The house is in my name. The deed, the mortgage, all of it. You have zero legal rights to this property. As she stood there looking so smug and victorious, I felt this strange calm wash over me. She was absolutely right. The house was 100% in her name. But Jennifer had always been careless about paperwork. She'd forgotten one tiny detail buried in the property documents. Three years ago, I was working as a city planning assistant. Part of my job was reviewing old property records and lease agreements. That's when I discovered something interesting about our neighborhood. Most people don't know this, but some residential areas in our city were built on land that the original developers leased, not bought outright. Our house sits on one of those plots, a 99 year ground lease that started in 1925 when we bought the house. Eight years ago, I noticed it in the fine print. The lease expires February 15th, 2025. That's exactly three weeks from today. I tried to explain it to Jennifer back then, but she was too excited about getting the house to listen. Whatever, David, just handle the boring legal stuff. I don't care about ancient lease agreements. So I handled it. I contacted the original landowner's estate and negotiated renewal terms. They agreed to sell me the land outright for $180,000, but only if I exercise the option before the lease expired. I've been saving for three years, putting aside money for my promotion without telling Jennifer. She thought I was just being cheap when I suggested we skip expensive vacations. You're right, I told her, my voice completely hollow. It's your house. I'll be packed and gone by Saturday. The relief and triumph on her face was something I'll never forget. She actually looked happy that she was destroying our marriage. I spent Friday packing, acting completely defeated. She watched me with this peeing look, probably thinking about how she'd finally gotten rid of dead weight me. She had no clue what was about to hit her. Saturday morning, I called Morrison and Associates, the law firm handling the estate. This is David Walsh. I'd like to exercise my option to purchase the land at 47 Maple street before the lease expires. The lawyer was surprised. Mr Walsh, that's cutting it close. The lease expires February 15th. If someone doesn't purchase by Then all structures on the property revert to the estate. I understand I have the $180,000 ready to transfer today within two hours. I own the land underneath Jennifer's house. Monday, Jennifer got served papers from Morrison and Associates the ground lease for her property had expired.

She avoided jail time but had to pay fines and attend a petty theft class. It was all public record, just forgotten. And then there was her DUI from 3 years ago, the one mom begged me not to tell anyone about. Amanda had spent a night in jail, had her license suspended for a year, and attended mandatory AA meetings, both cases public record. She wanted to play dirty? Fine.

Relax. It's just for fun. Everyone thinks it's hilarious. You humiliated me in front of everyone I know. Oh, come on, she sneered. You've always been the boring one. Let me have a little fun. It's not like you have a reputation to ruin. That last line hit hard and something in me snapped. Amanda has always painted herself as the golden child, but I knew things about her that she didn't want public, things buried in county court records, things her husband's family had no idea about. I opened my laptop and went digging. It didn't take long to find exactly what I was looking for, Amanda's shoplifting arrest from six years ago. She had been caught stealing makeup and jewelry from a department store. She avoided jail time but had to pay fines and attend a petty theft class. It was all public record, just forgotten. And then there was her DUI from 3 years ago, the one mom begged me not to tell anyone about. Amanda had spent a night in jail, had her license suspended for a year, and attended mandatory AA meetings. Both cases public record. She wanted to play dirty? Fine. The next evening, I made a post on Facebook, SIM.

My grandma has been calling me by my cousin Emma's name for literally five years now. Every single time I see her birthday cards, Christmas presents, family dinners, all addressed to Emma. I'm Jess, by the way. Emma's my older cousin who lives three states away and visits maybe twice a year. At first I thought it was just an honest mistake. Emma, 78 and sometimes mixes things up. But then I realised she gets everyone else's names right. My little brother Tyler, my mom, even the mailman she talks to once a week. Just me, she can't remember. The thing that really got to me was last Thanksgiving when she handed me this beautiful hand knitted scarf and said, Happy Thanksgiving, Emma. I made this thinking of you. I thanked her and wore it all day while she told everyone how Emma was doing so well in college. I'm a senior in high school and work at a pizza place after school. My mom always makes excuses for her, like, oh, you know how grandma is, or, she means well, sweetie. But it honestly hurt. Like I'm so forgettable that my own grandma, who I see every month, can't even get my name right. So two weeks ago at Sunday dinner, I decided I'd had enough. When grandma opened the door, she goes, Emma, come give me a hug. And I just smiled and said, hi, Margaret. Instead of grandma, like I always do. She looked confused for a second, but didn't say anything. During dinner, when she asked Emma, how's school going? I respond ended with, I don't know, Margaret. You'd have to ask Emma. I'm doing fine, though. Thanks for asking. My mom shot me a look, but I kept going. When grandma offered me seconds on her famous Mac and cheese, I said, no, thank you, Margaret. I'm good. When she tried to give me leftovers to take home, I said, that's so nice of you, Margaret, but I can't carry all that. By the third Margaret, she stopped mid sentence and stared at me. Why do you keep calling me Margaret? I'm your grandmother. I looked right at her and said, oh, sorry. I thought we were just calling each other by random names. You know, since you've been calling me Emma for the past five years. The whole dinner table went silent. My uncle put down his fork. My mom looked like she wanted to crawl under the table. Tyler was trying not to laugh. Grandma's face went through like, 10 different emotions. First confused, then embarrassed.

I know that sounds weird coming from a white girl, but hear me out. This whole thing started about three years ago when I was living in Atlanta for my internship. My usual salon back home was like four hours away and I was desperate for a trim because my hair looked like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. My roommate, Keisha, was getting ready to head out to her salon and saw me struggling with my messy curls in the bathroom mirror. She just laughed and said, girl, come with me. My stylist will sort you out. I was hesitant because I'd never been to a black salon before. But honestly, my hair was so bad I would have tried anything. Walking into that salon was like entering a whole different world. The energy was incredible. Everyone was talking, laughing, music playing, kids running around while their moms got their hair done. It felt alive in a way that the buy it sterile salons I was used to never did. The stylist, Miss Janet, took one look at my hair and shook her head, baby, who's been cutting your hair? Because they need to stop. She started running her fingers through it, asking me about my routine, what products I used, how I dried it. Nobody had ever asked me those questions before. They just wet it, cut it and send me on my way. Miss Janet spent two hours on My hair, two hours. She deep conditioned it, trimmed each curl individually, showed me how to scrunch it properly and sent me home with specific instructions about what products to use and how often to wash it. My hair looked better than it ever had in my entire life. But here's the thing that really got me. She charged me $40. 40. The salon back home charged.

I discovered my daughter Harley was sneaking a boy into her room every night. When I checked our ring camera footage looking for a package thief instead of finding someone stealing Amazon boxes, I found Zachary Von climbing through her bedroom window at 1 a m. Like some wanna be Romeo. This kid was bad news. With his vape pen hanging from his mouth and. And sagging below his tiny Peppino and gumballs. I knew Zachary from around the neighborhood. He was 19 and still hung around the high school parking lot trying to impress freshman girls with his souped up Honda Civic. Last month, I'd seen him get arrested for shoplifting energy drinks from the gas station. He'd also been fired from three different fast food jobs for showing up high. This was definitely not the kind of guy I wanted near my 15 year old daughter. The footage showed this had been going on for two weeks straight. Every night at the same time, Zachary would climb the tree next to Harley's window and slip inside. They'd stay in there with the lights off until about 4 a m. When he'd sneak back out. My blood was boiling, but I knew if I confronted Harley directly, she'd just get defensive and keep seeing him in secret. I spent the next few days planning my approach while pretending I knew nothing. I Watched Harley at dinner acting like the perfect daughter while knowing she was lying to my face, say she was tired from studying, when really she'd been up all night with that loser. I had to bite my tongue when she asked for money for school supplies that I knew she was probably spending on whatever Zachary wanted. On Friday, I put my plan into action. I went to the grocery store and bought the most expensive, expensive steaks they had, along with all the fixings for a romantic dinner. I set up our dining room with candles and Harley's mom's good China that we only used on holidays. I even bought fancy cream sodas in glass bottles and put them in ice buckets like they were champagne. That night, I waited in the kitchen watching the ring camera feed on my phone. Right on schedule, Zachary appeared at 1:00am, climbing up a tree in his usual uniform of ripped jeans and a wife beater. I gave them 20 minutes to get comfortable, then headed upstairs with the biggest smile on my face. I could hear giggling and rustling sounds coming from Harley's room. I knocked twice and opened the door without waiting for an answer. Harley shrieked and pulled her blanket up to her chin, while Zachary literally fell off the bed trying to pull his shirt back on. They both looked at me like I was about to commit murder, but I just stood there grinning like I'd Won the lottery! Perfect timing! Dinner is ready downstairs. I made steaks, said in my most cheerful voice. Harley's face went from terrified to confused, while Zachary just sat on the floor with his mouth hanging open. Neither of them moved, so I clapped my hands together and added, come on now, don't let it get cold. I've been cooking all evening. They followed me downstairs in complete silence. Harley kept trying to catch my eye, but I just hummed to myself like this was totally normal. Zachary was stumbling over his own feet and pulling at his shirt like he was trying

Every Sunday for 15 years, my grandmother made the same announcement at family dinner. When I pass away, everything goes to whoever visits me most. She tap her cane on the floor and smile like she just revealed state secrets. This turned my entire extended family into vultures. My Aunt Rachel drove three hours every Tuesday just to vacuum Grandma's living room. Uncle Steve called twice daily asking about her arthritis. My cousin Jennifer moved back from California and started doing Grandma's grocery shopping. They all hated each other but pretended to be saints around her. Meanwhile, I was banned from inheritance discussions. I liked guys and chicken nuggets, and grandma made it crystal clear that sinners don't deserve family money. She change the subject whenever I entered rooms. My cousins would smirk and whisper about how I'd be working at McDonald's while they lived in luxury. But here's what none of them knew. I actually loved spending time with grandma. Not for money. She'd already told me I wasn't getting any, but because she was genuinely funny. When she wasn't performing for the Inheritance Hunters, while they argued over who deserved what, I'd sneak over on Wednesday nights to watch old movies and eat ice cream. Grandma would relax completely. When it was just us, she'd tell dinosaurs jokes from the two thousand BC and complain about how fake everyone was being. She even started Asking about my boyfriend and seemed genuinely interested in our relationship. I never mentioned these visits to anyone because I knew they'd think I was ski. After she passed last year, the whole family gathered for the will reading. Rachel brought a calculator. Steve wore his funeral suit from 1995. Jennifer had already started planning her European vacation. They were practically drooling as the lawyer opened the envelope.

When I was 12 years old, my mother slit her wrist in front of me because I asked to go to a friend's birthday party. And as she bled into our kitchen sink, she made me promise I'd never try to leave her again. She survived that time, barely. While the paramedics worked on her, she gripped my hand with bloody fingers and whispered, this is what happens when you abandon me. I spent three days in the hospital chapel, 13 years old and convinced I'd almost murdered my mother by wanting to go to a sleepover. When she came home, arm bandaged and eyes hollow, she made let me sleep in her bed so she could hold on to me all night. I need to know you're here, she said. Otherwise, the darkness comes back. The rules formed quickly after that. I couldn't join clubs because staying late at school feels like you're choosing them over me. I couldn't have friends over because their energy disrupts our bond. Each boundary came with the same threat, sometimes spoken, sometimes just a gesture toward her scarred wrists. She kept razors displayed on the bathroom counter like weapons, reminding me what would happen if I broke her heart again. By 14, I was homeschooled and complete, completely isolated. Mom said it was better this way, just us two against a world that didn't understand our connection. She'd have good days where she'd braid my Hair. And we'd watch movies and I think maybe this was enough. But then I'd mention wanting to learn to drive someday and she'd go silent. She'd lock herself in the bathroom and I'd sit outside the door begging her to come out. She'd emerge hours later showing me fresh cuts on her thighs, practice cuts, she'd call them for when you finally abandoned me for real. I attempted my first real escape at 15. I found a youth shelter address at the library and memorized it. One night while mom slept, I packed a bag and made it to the front door. But she was sitting in the dark living room waiting. I felt you pulling away, she said calmly. Then she swallowed an entire bottle of sleeping pills in front of me. I called 9 1 1 and rode with her to the hospital, holding her hand while they pumped her stomach. When she woke up, she smiled sadly. You did this, she said, but at least you stayed to watch. After that, she installed bells on my bedroom door and windows. She test me randomly, pretending to hurt herself to see if I try to leave or just save her. I always chose to save her, but I was dying inside, suffocating under the weight of keeping her alive. I started writing goodbye letters I never send, hiding them in my textbooks. I, I had to get away again. When I was 16. Mom had fallen asleep. After taking anxiety medication and I thought I had time, I made it three blocks before a police car pulled up. Mom had called them claiming I was mentally unstable. She'd shown them my hidden letters as evidence. As I drove me home, she texted me, if you'd kept going, you would have found my body when you came back. I had the bath ready that night. She showed me a new scar on her stomach. I did this while you were gone, she said. She made me help her bandage it, narrating how she would have cut deeper if I made it another block. Next time you leave, she promised, I'll make sure I time it perfectly. You'll be free, but you'll be a murderer. I became hyper vigilant, watching for signs she was spiraling. My entire existence became keeping her from the edge. When I caught her standing on our apartment balcony at 3:00am, I didn't ask why. I just took her hand and let her back to bed. But then I got a scholarship to art school. Mom found the acceptance letter before I could hide it. She didn't say anything, just disappeared into the bathroom. I heard water running and pounded on the door. When she finally.

I literally had dried Cobra venom on my jacket when I walked into the pet store to grab crickets for my daughter's gecko. As the state's only level 5 venomous reptile specialist, I just finished extracting 17 illegally trafficked snakes from a mansion and I looked like death incarnate. But I promised her I'd bring dinner home for Godzilla. This woman, dripping in designer everything, was screaming at the teenage cashier about two thousand dollar automatic litter box she wanted to return after using it for 3 months. The poor kid was practically shaking as this lunatic demanded corporate's number and threatened to get everyone fired for not accepting her clearly against policy return. I stepped forward from the reptile supply aisle, keeping my voice level and professional despite my exhaustion because someone needed to be the adult here. Hey, the kids just doing their job and doesn't make the return policies, so maybe ease up before security has to get involved since you're causing a scene that's getting filmed by half a store. She spun around so fast her extensions whipped through the air and the look of pure revulsion that crossed her face when she saw me would have been funny if it wasn't so genuinely nasty. Her nose wrinkled like she just stepped in something unfortunate and he actually took a step back while clutching her purse closer. Are you seriously trying to tell me what to Do when you smell like you've been rolling in dog shit. She looked me up and down, her voice dripping with contempt. What are you even doing in here? Collecting cans from the parking lot to buy yourself a 40? The other customers were pulling out their phones now, sensing this was about to go viral. Look at you, covered in filth like some kind of sewer rat who crawled out of the drainage system. She stepped closer, emboldened by the cameras. Probably sleep under a bridge somewhere, telling yourself it's temporary while you've been between jobs for what, five years? 10? Her laugh was sharp and cruel. I bet you stand outside this store every day with a cardboard sign begging for change. And now you think you can walk in here and tell me what to do? She was getting louder, playing to her audience. You know what's pathetic? You're probably, probably 40 years old, never accomplished anything, never will accomplish anything. Just another waste of space sucking up oxygen that productive members of society could be using. She gestured at my torn shirt with disgust. Those clothes look like you fish them out of a donation bin. Probably still smell like the person who died in them. The teenage cashier tried to interject, but the woman steam rolled on. This is exactly what's wrong with this city. Letting people like you wander around harassing tax paying citizens who actually contribute to society instead of just leeching off It. She turned to the gathering crowd. You all see this? This is why we need stricter vagrancy laws. To keep these people away from our families and businesses. Back to me. Her voice went even higher. What's your story, huh? Let me guess. Dropped out of high school, couldn't hold down a job at McDonald's, probably got a record for petty theft or public intoxication. And now you shuffle around town pretending anyone gives a damn about your worthless opinions. She pulled out her phone like she was going to call someone. I should report you to the police right now for harassment. Get you thrown back in whatever institution you obviously escaped from. Her eyes narrowed with genuine Alice. You're going to die alone in an alley somewhere, probably freeze to death next winter. And the only reason anyone will notice is because your corpse will be blocking the delivery entrance. She paused for effect, making sure everyone was still recording. And you know what the saddest part is? Your own mother probably crosses the street when she sees you coming, ashamed that she gave birth to such a complete and utter failure of a human being. Venomous snake loose in reptile section. The managers panicked.

I worked at the same insurance office for almost 10 years. Every single morning, I'd stop at Jerry's Coffee on Fifth Street, order my usual black coffee, and add what I thought was cream from the self serve station. My co workers always made fun of how strong and bitter my coffee was. They take one sip and make faces like I was drinking motor oil. How do you drink that garbage? My desk mate Ashley would say, watching me gulp down my morning cup. I just laugh and tell her I liked my coffee with character. Strong and bold, just like me. The whole office knew about my weird coffee preference. Even during meetings, people would joke about how I could probably strip paint with whatever I was drinking. For almost a decade, this was my routine. Same coffee shop, same order, same weird looks from everyone who tried it. I thought I just had different taste buds or something. Maybe I was just tougher than everyone else when it came to bitter drinks. And one Tuesday morning, Jerry's Coffee was closed for kitchen repairs. A handwritten sign on the door said they'd be back in a week. I panicked a little because I'm not great with change. But I spotted another coffee place just two blocks down called bean. There I walked in and ordered my usual black coffee, please. The young Barista with purple hair smiled and handed me the cup. Then I asked for cream on the side, just like I always did at Jerry's. She pointed to a small metal pitcher next to the sugar packets. I poured in my usual amount and took that first sip. My mouth almost dropped open. The coffee was smooth, creamy, actually enjoyable to drink. Instead of feeling like punishment, I thought maybe this place just had really good coffee beans or something. When Jerry's reopened the next week, I went back to my normal routine. But something was bugging me. Now, why did that other place taste so different? Was their coffee really that much better? I decided to pay closer attention to what I was doing. I walked up to the self serve.

My sister in law, Jessica, has this thing where she treats my eight year old son, Tyler, like he's invisible. Whenever we're at family gatherings, she'll acknowledge every other kid in the room, give them hugs, ask about school, bring little gifts. But when it comes to Tyler, it's like he doesn't exist. She'll literally walk past him without even making eye contact. At first I thought maybe I was being paranoid, but then I started really paying attention. Last Christmas, she brought presents for all six grandkids except Tyler. When my mother in law asked where Tyler's gift was, Jessica just shrugged and said, oh, I must have forgotten. But she had a whole list on her phone that she checked off as she handed out the other presents. The worst part is, Tyler notices. He's a smart kid, and he started asking me why Aunt Jessica doesn't like him. What am I supposed to say to that? Oh, honey, your aunt is just a petty adult who's mad at Mommy for some reason, so she takes it out on you. I can't tell him that. The thing is, Jessica and I got into it about two years ago over something stupid. My husband's family has this tradition where they all go on a beach vacation together every summer. Well, that year, Jessica decided she wanted to plan the whole thing and book Everything. She picked this expensive resort in Florida and expected everyone to pay, like $800 per person. I told her we couldn't afford it, especially with Tyler needing new school clothes and us trying to save for a house. She got all huffy and said if we really wanted to prioritize family, we'd find a way to make it work. I said maybe we could look at somewhere more affordable so everyone could come. She completely lost it. Started going off about how I was always trying to control everything and ruin her plans. I wasn't trying to control anything. I just wanted my family to be able to afford to participate. But she took it as some personal attack and has been ice cold to Tyler ever since. So last month was Jessica's birthday party. She was turning 35 and made this huge deal about it. Rented out the back room at some fancy restaurant, invited like 50 people. The whole family was there. All the cousins, aunts, uncles, everyone. I decided I was done watching my kid get treated like garbage. When we walked into the party, I made sure to greet everyone else first. I hugged her mom, chatted with her sister, complimented her dad's new glasses, asked her brother about his job. I spent probably 20 minutes working the room, talking to every single person there. Jessica was standing right there the whole time, clearly expecting me to come say hi and wish her happy birthday. But I just kept talking to other people. When Tyler ran off to play with his cousins, I continued my rounds, making small talk with Jessica's friends, asking about their kids, their jobs, their vacations. Finally, Jessica came up to me. She had this fake smile plastered on her face and said, hey, thanks for coming. I looked right

My roommate Kate has this incredible superpower of she can selectively forget her wallet every single time we go somewhere that cost money. But somehow she never forgets it when she's going shopping alone or getting her nails done. We've been living together for eight months and I've been keeping track. She's forgotten her wallet 17 times. 17. And every single time she gives me this look like I'm supposed to cover her because I have a corporate job and she's a freelance artist. Last Tuesday, she comes bouncing into our apartment with this huge grin. Guess what? I booked us a table at Meridian for my birthday dinner Friday night. I invited Jessica, Mike and L too. Meridian, the place where appetizers start at $35, knew exactly what was coming. This was going to be her biggest scam yet. Order expensive food for everyone on her special day, then conveniently forget her wallet and guilt everyone else into splitting the massive Bill. Friday night arrives, she's getting ready, humming some Taylor Swift song, completely in her element. I'm watching from my doorway as she does her usual routine. Phone, check. Keys, check. Lipstick, check. Tiny purse, check. She even did that fake little gasp and snap, like got everything, as if to seal the performance. But there it was, her wallet sitting in plain sight on the nightstand, once again, mysteriously excluded from the essentials. It was like watching Someone rehearse a scam she's pulled off a dozen times. Wallet sitting on nightstand, ignored. I'm just going to touch up my mascara real quick. She calls out, heading to the bathroom. That's when I made my move. I slipped into her room and grabbed the wallet. Black leather, kind of heavy actually. I could feel credit cards and cash inside. We meet everyone at the restaurant. Meridian has this whole upscale vibe, dim lighting, fancy cloth napkins, waiters and actual uniforms. Kate is in full birthday girl mode, telling everyone to order whatever they want. It's my special day. Go crazy. Jessica orders a 40 dollar salmon. Mike gets the 55 dollar steak. L goes for the lamb, which is like 60 dollars. Kate orders the Seafood Tower for herself. Eighty five dollars. We're laughing, having a good time, taking birthday photos. Kate is being the perfect hostess. Then the check comes, $230. Kate looks at it and starts patting down her tiny purse, checking her jacket pockets, looking under the table. Oh my god, you guys, I am so embarrassed. I totally forgot my wallet at home. Here we go. Can someone cover me? I'll Venmo every.

When I was 12, I discovered I could taste colors. Not metaphorically. I literally tasted them. Blue was salty, red was sweet. Yellow made me gag. I thought everyone experienced this until I mentioned that the blue crayon tasted like ocean water and my teacher sent me to the nurse. My parents took me to specialist after they diagnosed me with synesthesia, a rare neurological condition where senses crosswire. Only one in 2,000 people have it. I felt like a freak. Kids at school called me Taste Girl and would wave colorful objects in my face, asking what they tasted like. During lunch, they'd hold up their bright lunch boxes and demand I describe the flavors. The red apple packaging tasted like cherry candy, but I'd lie and say I didn't know just to make them. I Learned to hide it completely. For years, I pretended to be normal while secretly navigating a world where every color had a flavor. Grocery stores were overwhelming. The bright product packaging created a symphony of tastes in my mouth. I'd shop with my eyes half closed, trying to minimize the sensory overload. My parents stopped talking about it after the initial diagnosis. I treated it like an embarrassing family secret. When relatives visited, mom would quietly warn me not to mention the color thing because it made people uncomfortable. High school was torture. Art class was the worst. All those vibrant paints made My mouth water and revolt simultaneously. I switched to black and white photography just to avoid the taste chaos. Then in college, everything changed. I was sitting in my psychology class half asleep during a lecture about rare neurological conditions when the professor mentioned synesthesia. During the discussion, this guy, Ben, raised his hand and said, I have that. Blue tastes salty to me. My heart stopped. I'd never met another person like me. I spent the rest of the lecture staring at the back of his head, afraid to hope. After class, I approached him nervously, my hands literally shaking. What does red taste like, I asked, barely above a whisper. Sweet like candy, he replied immediately, his eyes lighting up. That simple exchange felt like coming home after years of exile. We spent the next four hours in the campus coffee shop comparing our experiences. Yellow made him gag, too, like rotten eggs, he said. Purple was bitter, almost medicinal. Green was minty fresh, which made us both laugh because we'd independently started associating it with toothpaste. For the first time in my life, I didn't feel alone. Someone else understood why I couldn't eat off plates, why I preferred neutral colored clothes, why certain movie scenes made me physically nauseous from the color combination. We started dating six months later. Ben understood my world in ways no one else could. When I said the sunset tasted like strawberries and lime, he knew exactly what I meant when We watched fireworks. We'd compare flavor notes like wine connoisseurs, he helped me embrace my synesthesia instead of hiding it. We'd go to art museums together, sharing whispered descriptions of what each painting tasted like. Van Goes, Starry Night was a complex blend of vanilla, salt and something metallic that we could never quite identify. Then made me feel special instead of strange. She'd bring me flowers and specific color combinations because he knew they'd create interesting flavor profiles. Once he surprised me with a bouquet arranged in gradient order so I could taste the rainbow properly. Three years later, he proposed with a blue sapphire ring because he knew it would taste like our first conversation, salty and unforgettable. I said yes immediately, tears streaming down my face. Finally, someone who truly understood me. But here's the twist that shattered everything. Last week, while helping him move some books, I found his old psychology textbook. It was filled with highlighted sections about synesthesia, detailed notes about common taste associations and even a handwritten chart matching colors to flavors. My blood ran cold.

My dad wasn't always so mean. He used to sing in the car and make pancakes with smiley faces every Sunday. He read us bedtime stories with different voices and played with us whenever we wanted. But then mom left us, telling dad he was too boring and nice for her and how she wanted an adventurous life with some guy on a motorcycle. Something in dad just broke when I tried to cheer him up with a drawing I made of our family. He wasn't interested. Not now. I'm busy. But dad, I insisted. I made you super tall and strong. Dad suddenly raised his voice. I said, not now. I stumbled back and hid the drawing in my bag. I thought maybe it was just a really bad time for him. My sister and brother and I spent a whole week making a play for dad, hoping to help him smile again. We use the couch cushions to make a stage in the living room. My sister made tickets out of construction paper. We practiced every day after school while dad was at work. Dad, we have a surprise for you, I said after dinner on Friday. We made a play and you're invited. Dad looked at his phone and got up to leave. I have work to do. Only 10 minutes, my brother promised. Please. My sister held out the golden ticket she'd made just for him. He sighed and Sat down but kept his phone in his hand. We started to play and watched him scroll through emails. In the first half, my sister ended up stopping midway, waiting for him to watch with tears in her ears. Dad, I said, trying to get his attention, can you please just watch? We worked really hard. He looked up at me with this cold expression. This is ridiculous list. I don't have time for games. Then he stood up and walked to his office, leaving us to tear down and throw out everything we prepared for the play. Aunt Melanie visited about six months after mom left to check in on us. She listened to all our complaints about dad and how he stopped spending time with us. You're turning into your father, she told him. The kids need you and you're shutting them down just like he did to you. Dad glared at her. Being soft got me nowhere. Look where being nice got me. They need to learn the world isn't kind. Aunt Melanie tried to argue, but dad wouldn't listen. After she left, he started working even later. We ate leftovers and stared at his empty air waiting for him to come home. Instead of just being cold, dad also started becoming aggressive. Out of nowhere, my little sister asked him to read her a bedtime story, holding out the book we used to read together. You're not a kid anymore, he said. But she was only 7 when my brother got the flu and asked dad to stay home from work. Dad told him, you're fine, stop being dramatic. And when I came home crying because kids at school called me names, dad barely reacted. Stop being so sensitive. Fight back or they'll never stop. When I couldn't stop crying, he stood up fast. I told you to stop. His hand went up and I flinched. He froze for a second, then lowered it. Go to your room. You're grounded. We eventually just stopped looking for him and started dealing with everyone on our own without a single adult to rely on. It was lonely. But for the sake of my siblings, I wasn't ready to give up just yet. Father's Day was coming up and I had this idea that maybe I could remind dad of who he used to be. I spent three weeks making a photo album called Reasons My dad is amazing. Found old pictures from before when he smiled all the time. I drew pictures and wrote little notes on every page. Dad is amazing because he used to sing in the car. Dad is amazing because he made the best pancakes. Dad is amazing because his hugs made everything better. I felt proud of the outcome and bit sad how different everything had become. I was so nervous at dinner when I gave it to him. I made this for you, I said. He flipped through it and his face Got darker with every page. Why would you show me this? He asked, his voice almost threatening. I thought maybe you'd remember being happy, I said meekly. He slammed the album shut and threw it into the nearest trash bin. That person is gone. He was weak, too nice. Don't you ever bring him up again. He looked at me with eyes like dagger and grow up already. All the anger and frustration suddenly spilled over inside me. You're so mean. I hate you, I screamed. I hate you. I want my dad back. The room went completely silent. Dad's face seemed to.

In my village, parents buried their daughters alive for 24 hours on their 16th birthday in wooden boxes underground because they believed facing death would make us worthy of marriage. Every woman I knew had survived it. My mother, my aunts, all my female cousins. They shared the same hollow eyes, the same way of flinching at small spaces. Nobody talked about what happened in those boxes, but everyone knew girls who hadn't come back up. I watched them bury my cousin Soledad when I was 14. The men lowered her pine coffin into the six foot hole while the women sang funeral hymns. They gave her one bottle of water and a bell to ring if she was dying. But ringing meant failure, meant weakness, meant your bloodline was cursed with cowardice. When they pulled solid up 24 hours later, she couldn't stop shaking. Her lips were blue. She slept with lights on for the rest of her life, but she never rang the bell. My mother started preparing me that same year. She locked me in our root cellar for hours to practice darkness. She'd make me lie in the bathtub with boards across the top to simulate the coffin. She'd restrict my breathing with scarves around my chest to prepare for the weight of earth. I had two years to plan, two years of sneaking out at night to dig. The burial field was marked with white stones. Where each girl would go, I found mine and dug my own salvation six feet down, then three feet sideways, a hidden tunnel with air pipes I stole from construction sites. I stockpiled water, food, flashlights, even sedatives from my grandmother's medicine cabinet. My 16th birthday arrived like a death sentence. The entire village gathered at dawn. My father had built my coffin himself, carved with flowers. My mother braided white ribbons in my hair. The elders blessed the ground and spoke about.

Didn't matter if you were 12, 13 or 14, the blood meant you were ready for a husband at least three times your age. I grew up with this idea. So in my head it didn't seem that bad until I turned 11 because that's when I watched my cousin Mariam get promised to a 43 year old man just three days after her first period. His previous two wives had died before turning 20. That was the first night I decided to stop eating enough food, not because I was fat and not because I hated food, but because if I noticed the skinnier girls in my family would be the last ones to get their period and I knew it was my only option. I later Learned that your body actually needs to have enough fat before starting puberty. Lol. The other girls called me skeleton, but I didn't care. Other girls my age were already promised to men who had children older than them. That didn't mean they stopped prepping me to be a wife though. Every Friday from 1:00am to 10:00am I was made to serve meals to male family members for hours without speaking. And of course if I made eye contact or noise while serving, then I would receive 10 lashes of the belt. I was forced to hold burning pots without other. It's to tough enough soft hands for kitchen work. And every night my mom put skin whitening cream all over my face so I could be beautiful. And other than the secret starvation, I was the perfect daughter. I played the part with zero complaints and always talked about how excited I was to have kids. But when I was 14 and still period less, I found something that changed everything. For context, we were in the USA the whole time. Lol. My mom had just convinced us that all of this was normal and that any girl who didn't do this was bound to die alone, as well as being ugly and useless. Until one teacher forced me to have a meeting with her because I had accidentally worn a T-shirt to school and she saw how skinny I was. When she walked out to go to the bathroom, she had forgotten to lock her drawer. Inside were books about marriage laws, pamphlets with titles like your rights as a young teenager and when culture becomes crime. As I read, my jaw dropped. It was the first time I had been introduced to the idea that marriage under 18.

So I made her watch him fall for me instead. My younger sister, Mia, has been using the same excuse since she turned 21. She can't have her one true love so she's entitled to destroy everyone else's. And I don't mean that in the cute she still hung up on her ex kind of way. I mean it like if you're happy, she'll find a way to make you miserable. Then blame it on her tragic love story, the one true love, some guy named Ethan she met at a college party four years ago. They hooked up once. He never called. And somehow that became her origin story for being a piece of shit. It started with her best friend since kindergarten, Jess. One weekend, Mia stayed over at Jess's place and by Monday, Jess's boyfriend was sending Mia good morning texts. When Jess found them together in her own bed, Mia actually said, you don't understand what it's like to lose your soulmate. Jess never spoke to her again. Then came our cousin's engagement party. Mia showed up in a dress that cost more than my rent, got wine drunk and cornered the groom in the bathroom. Exact words later, she kept saying I reminded her of someone special. Thank god he pushed her off and told his fiance immediately. But Mia, she cried to our parents about how seeing happy couples triggered her. Trauma. Mom bought her a spa weekend to help her heal. By the time I met Ryan, I knew the drill. I kept him away from family dinners, deleted Mia from my social media and told him my sister was going through something and needed space. Two years it worked. We got engaged last spring. Small ceremony planned, nothing fancy, just us and close friends. I made one mistake, though. I mentioned it at Mom's birthday dinner. Mia's eyes lit up like Christmas came early. I'm so happy for you, she said while hugging me. When do I get to meet him? A week later, Ryan showed me his phone, laughing. Your sister found me on Instagram with some fake account. Look at these messages. We read them to.

Why would I embarrass myself with a man who's irate? Why would I do that? It wasn't irate. So you wouldn't put her on the phone? Well, no, he's pottering he's screaming at me he's threatening to burn down our house. You guys just interfered in something you shouldn't have been interfering in the whole relationship sounds very volatile. Well, he seemed very calm until he felt like you were lying and then yeah, he lost his mind because I'm at work I cannot scream my head off the way he can okay. And he's he's crazy. You guys don't know how crazy he is He's crazy jealous since Day one. We don't know. We don't know. We don't know. We heard his side. We heard your side. Yeah. Well, maybe we should let you go.

Okay, is this, like, he has a pretty crazy search history that includes a kinky fetish type thing, or is it worse? No, it's worse. Um, so I was looking at his iPad because it's connected to his phone, and I had to reset our home, like, security system, and he keeps the code on there in his note section. So I was getting the code, and I noticed one of the sections in his note that was called Gift Ideas. So I was like, hmm, maybe I'll take a quick peek, see if he picked up on the many hints that I've been leaving. Um, so wait. So, wait, so you snoop? So you're a Christmas gift snooper, then? For shame. Yeah, I know. I'm a bad person, but, uh, anyway, I was looking, and I see some. Some of the stuff he was thinking about getting the family and friends, and then I see a name Steph, and I'm like, hmm, I don't know a Steph. Um, and I see he was planning on getting her, um, diamond stud earrings, so. Oh, now I'm like, who. Who the heck is this staff person? So, to your knowledge, he doesn't have, like, a cousin, staff or a sibling? It's not his mom's name or his grandma? No. No staff that I can think of at all. And I'm like, well, maybe this is Just a co worker or a good friend. But still, like, is it even okay for a married man to buy. Be buying diamond earrings for a friend or a co worker? I mean. I mean, it kind of depends, so. Right. I mean, if it's somebody, maybe they're retiring after many years of working with him. Or are the diamonds, like, teeny, tiny cheapos? Listen, but even if they are, I don't know if a married man has any business buying diamond earrings for another woman for any reason. Has he ever bought you diamond earrings? Yeah, but many, many years ago. Okay, but see, he took care of his wife first. Then I don't know. I don't think there's any reason why a married man should be buying diamond earrings for another woman. See, that's exactly how I feel as well. So. Okay, what do you want us to do then, Casey? I like to know who this staff person is and why he's buying her diamond earring. Okay, well, I'm not sure if we can answer the second question, but we can definitely find out the more important one, which. Who is this staff person? And. And I'm assuming we can call your husband? Yes, absolutely. Okay, and what is his name? I don't think you ever told us. It's John. John. Okay, so hang on a sec, and then we'll get John's number from you, and then we'll call him when we come back next. Hello? Hi, can I speak to John, please? Can I ask who's calling? Sure. This is the Z Morning Zoo radio show on Z1O4. Nick, Natalie and Shaggy. Is this John? It sure is. What's up, everybody? Not much. How are you this morning? I'm doing well. I'm doing real well, actually. Uh, you know, I feel a lot better if you're about to tell me I won something, though. Oh, yeah? Well, ha, ha. I wish that was why you were calling. Actually, we've been doing something really special on our show this week called Sexy Secret Santa, and that's why we called you. Okay, so the way it works is if somebody's got, like, a special person in their lives and they're kind of, like a secret, they call us and tell us to wish them a very sexy Christmas. Kinda lame, you know? I know. But listen, we got a call from Steph about you. I guess she said you were a very special person to her, so. Who is Steph

Yeah, she was really complimentary. That's really nice. I mean, we had a lot of fun. It was a fun time. So you liked it? She was fun. Are you not attracted to her? Is that the issue? No, I would she's cute. I like her, but it's just not gonna work out. Okay. Well, why if she's cute and you had fun, that sounds awful. Is that a problem? You don't like that? No, I really like that. It's just she lied. She lied. Whoa. About what? Uh, actually, let me rephrase that. She wasn't 100% truthful with me. Okay. Okay. Who is on a first date? Let's be honest. Well, yeah, but I mean, this is kind of an important thing that she wasn't very truthful about. What was it? Well, she said her name was Stephanie on Tinder. Okay. Okay. And then when we met, it was revealed that her name is summer. So she uses a different name on Tinder. Yeah. Well, No. 1, I don't know why someone would do that, but I, I could think of a lot of reasons. Maybe she's got a crazy ex or she doesn't want people to know or she doesn't Want her job to be able to search her on Tinder. Okay. I mean, nonetheless, I'd still wouldn't work out why? Why is that a big deal? Yeah. Well, yeah. So her name is summer. Her name is summer. Okay. My last name is pants.

Yeah, I, I would love that. Well, I would not love that. It make me very uncomfortable knowing maybe people are making fun of her behind her back or something like that. Oh my God, you jumped so many steps by the way. Well, I know I'm going fast, but I'm looking for a long term relationship. So I'm not there to just mess around with people. And so. So you're looking for a forever pants. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hey, don't get smarty pants and you okay. You don't feel like somebody with the name Summer Pants would be the person that you want to be around all the time? No, it's just a little too awkward. Okay. But you aren't the ah, so many assumptions here. One that she would even take your name when you got married. Like a lot of women keep their last name and that's fine. No, I come kind of from a more traditional point of view. So you want whoever you marry To take your last name. Yeah, I do. Even though it's an awkward life to live with the last name pants. I know it is. I'm living it. Hahaha. But you're Daniel pants and you don't think summer pants would be a good partner for you? No, I just couldn't do that to her. Okay. Well, and that's it. That's the only reason. That is the biggest reason. Yes. That is so ridiculous to me. Okay. Yes. You could be missing out on the love of your life because of it. Silly thing. And years of great jokes. Yeah, that's a problem for me. I don't want my wife's name to be a joke. I just want us to be a happy family of pants.

What are you talking about? I have appendicitis, mom. I had Katie drive me here this afternoon. I was in so much pain, I could barely move. I called you and dad. Neither of you picked up. Elizabeth, I'll come to see you once your father gets home. Benny can't stay home alone, and the hospital scare him. Your father should get back in about two hours. Can you hang on until then? Don't let them do any procedures on you until I get there. Mom, are you serious right now? Excuse me? Ben is 12, mom. 12 years old. He can stay home alone. He's not a little baby anymore. He can entertain himself. He doesn't need to be connected to you at the hip all the time. Or tell him to grow the hell up and just come to the hospital. If it was Ben in the hospital, not me, you'd be here in a heartbeat. You'd drop everything, leave work, leave anything. Elizabeth, how dare you talk to me that way? How dare you be so selfish? Have some respect, mom. You don't understand. You don't respect me. You don't care about anything that I love. You only care about Ben. Do you even love me, mom? Oh, Elizabeth, you haven't noticed a single thing about my life in years. You haven't even bothered to care. Mom, you haven't noticed that I have a girlfriend? Mom, we've been dating for a year. Now, we went to prom together, but you make me leave early to pick up Ben from a sleepover because he forgot his iPad at home. My girlfriend and I got into the interview recently. It's on the school website. But you never even watched it. Elizabeth, please let me talk. I'm packing a bag right now. I'm going to bring Ben to his friend's house and head to you. No. All you do is talk, and all I do is listen. I'm done. Mom, I want you to hear me. Please, Mommy, hear me. I'm listening, Beth. I am listening. I hate myself. I feel like I'll always be nothing. You've made me feel like I'll forever be nothing. Like I'll never matter. And honestly, maybe I won't ever matter. I've spent so much time adjusting to what you need me to be, what you expected of me. I stopped even caring if I liked myself. And I don't. I hate myself. And I hate that all I do is please other people. Beth, I'm on the way right now. Please just wait until I get there. We can talk, okay? Actually, no, I will listen. I will. I promise. And you talk. I'm sorry. I know I should have said it sooner. Yeah, you're right. You should have. And it's too late for sorry. At least this way, you can finally put that college fund of mine towards Ben's dreams like you've always wanted to. Elizabeth, what are You talking about. What are you doing? Elizabeth? Elizabeth? Elizabeth, please answer me. Beth, please pick up the phone. I'm five minutes away. Mommy. So sorry.

You know that one guy at every party, the one who thinks he's God's gift to alcohol and women? The guy who says things like I mix better than I date and if you can't handle a little fun, go home. Yeah, that guy, for me, that guy had a name, Mason. Mason was the kind of guy who wore sunglasses indoors and took shirtless mirror pics like it was a civic duty. He thought spiking people's drinks was hilarious. Just a joke, bro, he'd say. Like slipping something into someone's drink was on par with drawing a mustache on a passed out friend. Spoiler alert, it's not. I found out the hard way. It was during our friend Bailey's New Year's party. Good people, decent music, enough food to soak up the bad decisions. I grabbed a drink off the kitchen island, non alcoholic cause I was the designated driver. Took a few sips. It tasted a little weird. Like if regret had a flavor, I figured maybe the soda was flat. 10 minutes later, the room started spinning like it was trying to detach from earth. I barely made it to the bathroom before my legs went full Jello. My heart was racing in crawling and I was suddenly having a deep personal conversation with the floor tiles. Bailey found me an hour later curled up like a shrimp in her tub. She called an ambulance Thank god. Turns out Mason had decided to spice up the party by adding something to my drink, something prescription based, something not meant for conscious humans. He thought it was funny. Dude, you should have seen your face, he said, laughing when I confronted him. Relax. I gave you the light stuff. Ah, yes, just a sprinkle of involuntary coma. How festive. I wanted to punch him, but I'm not stupid. People forget bruises, but they don't forget fear, especially the kind that seeps in drop by drop. So I made a decision. Mason was going to become terrified of liquids, all of them. The plan took finesse. I couldn't just scream revenge and run at him with a water balloon. This had to feel like karma was slowly dripping down his neck. And it started with coffee. I knew Mason's routine every morning. Same cafe, same order, iced, triple espresso with oat milk, vanilla, two pumps of ego. So I applied for a job at that cafe, not because I needed it, but because revenge requires commitment. After three weeks of being the overly eager new guy, I got barista duty. Mason walked in. I greeted him with my best, you probably don't remember drugging me smile. He didn't recognize me. Perfect. I made his drink. Nothing in it yet. But after handing it to him, I leaned over and said, we've had a few complaints about mold in the oatmeal. Let's.

My husband always said he'd do anything to become a father, but I never imagined anything including my younger sister. We've been trying for three years. Every negative test felt like a tiny funeral while Mark sat beside me scrolling adoption sites like shopping online, sighing louder with each click. When my sister Emma offered to be our surrogate at Thanksgiving, I thought we caught a break. She'd already had two kids. I do anything for you, she said, squeezing my hand. Family helps family. I watched Mark's eyes meet hers across the table. That should have been my first warning. The fertility clinic quoted us $30,000 for IVF with surrogacy. Mark started a spreadsheet, calculating interest rates, loan options and even selling his motorcycle. Then one night over Chinese takeout, he sat down his chopsticks and said, what if we did it the traditional way? I laughed. What do you mean traditional? He leaned forward, completely serious. We skip the IVF. I just plant my seed directly in Emma. No medical costs, no procedures, same result. My chopsticks clattered to the table. He kept going, launching into this whole speech about efficiency and saving money, how people did it for centuries, how it would be clinical and quick, just a medical procedure without the medical bills. He said, I couldn't speak. I was too busy trying to process that my husband Had just asked to bang my sister. The guilt trip started immediately. I guess you don't really want kids. Other wives would understand the sacrifice. He even compared me to his coworker Janet, who'd done egg donation for her sister. Each comment was designed to make me feel selfish for saying no. By Week 3, Emma called me. Mark explained everything, she said, voice dripping with concern. I want you to know I'm open to it, whatever helps you become a mom. She went on about how it would be beautiful creating life for her sister and how the baby would be loved by everyone. I thanked her but said I wasn't sure yet and hung up. Then came the Thursday that changed everything. Mark was at his brother's bachelor party and I needed our insurance card for a dentist appointment. I searched his home office, rifling through his file filling cabinet and behind the tax returns, I found a Manila folder labeled medical. Inside were test results from two years before we married. Male factor infertility. Sperm count 0, completely sterile. My hands shook reading the urologist notes. Genital irreversible, no surgical options. He'd known every fertility appointment where he'd held my hand while doctors explained how my body was failing us every time I sobbed over negative tests. He knew he was the problem. I kept digging and opened his computer to see what else he might be hiding and saw text with my sister going back six Months. They talked about how once I agreed to the surrogacy, they wouldn't have to sneak around anymore, how this was really going to work and how they'd finally have a daughter of their own and make leaving me easy. They were actually joking about how simple their plan was. Emma wrote, she'll probably thank us for taking the burden off her. With a laughing emoji. Mark replied that they'd tell our families the baby needed her biological mom, that the child couldn't bond with me properly. Will look like we're doing what's best for the baby. He'd written, for stealing my life one text at a time. I could have left right then and there and dodged the biggest bullet of a lifetime, but what's the fun in that? So I called the one person he despised most, his older brother, Ryan, Harvard MBA investment banker. Daddy's favorite market's been our entire marriage. Making snide comments about Mister Perfect and trying to one up every story about Ryan's success. I laid it all out to Ryan, who just said, Jesus. Even for Mark, that's evil. When I told him I had an idea but needed his help, he didn't even hesitate. Whatever you're thinking, I'm in. From then on, I started acting defeated. I told Mark over breakfast, you're right, we should be practical about this. His whole face lit up like his plan was finally working. Later that same night, I asked Mark to meet me at home. For an important conversation. When he arrived, I was sitting calmly on the couch. I've been thinking about your suggestion about doing things tradition, I said. Mark leaned forward eagerly and, well, I found someone. We've already started trying. His face went white. What do you mean trying? You're infertile. Who? Oh, didn't I mention? Turned out I'm perfectly fertile. Just needed someone with working equipment. Called upstairs. You can come down now. Ryan walked down, adjusting his tie. Hey, little brother, thanks for the practical suggestion. I pulled out his fertility report and laid it out for him. Why are you upset? You're sterile. You've always been sterile. I held up my phone. Oh, and I just sent Emma your fertility report. All those promises about babies, she's finding out right now that you can't deliver. His jaw dropped as his phone started buzzing frantically. Came at me and said, you ruined my life. But Ryan was already dragging him toward the door. I filed for divorce the next morning and it was finalized after six months. Emma dumped him the moment she found out he was sterile and Mark lost everything. I'm focusing on myself now and honestly, I've never been happier. But I still think about Mark lying awake at night, wondering if his perfect brother really did screw his wife and when I might be expecting his brother's baby. I hope the thought eats him alive.

I watched Mark's eyes meet hers across the table. That should have been my first warning. The fertility clinic quoted us $30,000 for IVF with surrogacy. Mark started a spreadsheet, calculating interest rates, loan options and even selling his motorcycle. Then one night over Chinese takeout, he sat down his chopsticks and said, what if we did it the traditional way? I laughed. What do you mean traditional? He leaned forward, completely serious. We skip the IVF. I just plant my seed directly in Emma. No medical costs, no procedures, same result. My chopsticks clattered to the table. He kept going, launching into this whole speech about efficiency and saving money, how people did it for centuries, how it would be clinical and quick, just a medical procedure without the medical bills. He said, I couldn't speak. I was too busy trying to process that my husband Had just asked to bang my sister. The guilt trip started immediately. I guess you don't really want kids. Other wives would understand the sacrifice. He even compared me to his coworker Janet, who'd done egg donation for her sister. Each comment was designed to make me feel selfish for saying no. By Week 3, Emma called me. Mark explained everything, she said, voice dripping with concern. I want you to know I'm open to it, whatever helps you become a mom. She went on about how it would be beautiful creating life for her sister and how the baby would be loved by everyone. I thanked her but said I wasn't sure yet and hung up. Then came the Thursday that changed everything. Mark was at his brother's bachelor party and I needed our insurance card for a dentist appointment. I searched his home office, rifling through his file filling cabinet and behind the tax returns, I found a Manila folder labeled medical. Inside were test results from two years before we married. Male factor infertility. Sperm count 0, completely sterile. My hands shook reading the urologist notes. Genital irreversible, no surgical options. He'd known every fertility appointment where he'd held my hand while doctors explained how my body was failing us every time I sobbed over negative tests. He knew he was the problem. I kept digging and opened his computer to see what else he might be hiding and saw text with my sister going back six Months. They talked about how once I agreed to the surrogacy, they wouldn't have to sneak around anymore, how this was really going to work and how they'd finally have a daughter of their own and make leaving me easy. They were actually joking about how simple their plan was. Emma wrote, she'll probably thank us for taking the burden off her. With a laughing emoji. Mark replied that they'd tell our families the baby needed her biological mom, that the child couldn't bond with me properly. We'll look like we're doing what's best for the baby. He'd written, for stealing my life one text at a time. I could have left right then and there and dodged the biggest bullet of a lifetime, but what's the fun in that? So I called the one person he despised most, his older brother, Ryan, Harvard MBA investment banker. Daddy's favorite market's been our entire marriage. Making snide comments about Mister Perfect and trying to one up every story about Ryan's success. I laid it all out to Ryan, who just said, Jesus. Even for Mark, that's evil. When I told him I had an idea but needed his help, he didn't even hesitate. Whatever you're thinking, I'm in. From then on, I started acting defeated. I told Mark over breakfast, you're right, we should be practical about this. His whole face lit up like his plan was finally working. Later that same night, I asked Mark to meet me at home. For an important conversation. When he arrived, I was sitting calmly on the couch. I've been thinking about your suggestion about doing things tradition, I said. Mark leaned forward eagerly and, well, I found someone. We've already started trying. His face went white. What do you mean trying? You're infertile. Who? Oh, didn't I mention? Turns out I'm perfectly fertile. Just needed someone with working equipment. Called upstairs. You can come down now. Ryan walked down, adjusting his tie. Hey, little brother, thanks for the practical suggestion. I pulled out his fertility report and laid it out for him. Why are you upset? You're sterile. You've always been sterile. I held up my phone. Oh, and I just sent Emma your fertility report. All those promises about babies, she's finding out right now that you can't deliver. His jaw dropped as his phone started buzzing frantically. Came at me and said, you ruined my life. But Ryan was already dragging him toward the door. I filed for divorce the next morning and it was finalized after six months. Emma dumped him the moment she found out he was sterile and Mark lost everything. I'm focusing on myself now and honestly, I've never been happier. But I still think about Mark lying awake at night, wondering if his perfect brother really did screw his wife and when I might be expecting his brother's baby. I hope the thought eats him alive.

Now he's trapped in his own mess. I was adopted and my foster parents treated me like their own kid and their kids treated me like their sibling, except for Chad. Chad was an insensitive a hole to everyone. He would fight our older sister, say horrible things to everyone. And his anger issues caused him to break doors and punch holes in walls. The worst thing was when he got up in front of our whole class year and told them I wasn't his sister and never would be. He claimed I would never be a part of his family and I should stop trying. He would keep doing this up until he moved out and I stopped talking to him. I have stayed as far away from him as possible, only seeing him for family pictures every year because our mother asks. Recently he got married and had a baby and everyone was congratulating him except for me. Our mom noticed and asked why I was distancing myself from him. I told her about high school and she said this is still my kid and it's my first grandbaby. And it was the reason she wasn't going to be upset over it. I knew that would happen. Out of nowhere, I got a message from Chad begging me to go babysit for Them because you're the only one who can deal with these kinds of babies because no one will help. He knows I have insomnia and that's why I don't mind staying up. I can't tell if that's a blessing or a curse at this point. For some reason, I accepted and went over at eight PM when I showed up, I was greeted by Chad's wife who had the biggest eye bags but still greeted me with a smile. She explained the baby's night route feedings and said they would be home around 12:30 at most. After this, Chad showed up, looked at me for over a minute and gave me a small wave, then left the house. His wife followed and told me to call or text if I needed anything. For a minute, I was just stunned but went to take care of the baby. He was fine the whole time. And then twelve thirty PM rolled around, but they weren't home. I decided to wait and then ended up texting them at one asking where they were. I got no reply from either of them. They finally showed up at 3 in the morning. I'm livid at this point. I walked into the living room and told them I was waiting for their response. Chad's wife said, oh, Chad said it was fine and that it would only be an hour more. I cut her off to say, it's fine, whatever, the baby's sleeping. I thought I Could walk out of there with my head held high. But when I walked past Chad, I blurted out, so you aren't going to say anything to me after I looked after your kid for seven hours? He snorted at me and was like, no, my wife is the one who talked me into this. Pissed off, I said, so this wasn't a way to apologize for high school or all those other times you outcast me from the family because I was under the impression that you'd want to patch things up? He snapped back, why should I apologize? Nothing from high school has changed. You really do need to just grow up and understand that me and my wife aren't going to cater to you like mom and dad did because you're adopted. You ain't our family and you won't ever be. I turned to his wife and told her she married a disgusting piece of crap and if he continues to act this way, his son will grow up to hate him, too. One day she'll resent him for what he is and she'll only have herself to blame. Chad got angry and said, I had no right to talk to her like that when not even my real family wanted me. I reminded him that his wife also has an adopted sister, told her that if this was the way he spoke about me, then what did she think he was saying about her sister? He Surely wasn't treating her like a princess. I could see that I was getting through to her. But then Chad punched a wall. Classic Chad. I screamed not out of fear, but because I wanted to wake the baby up out of pure spitefulness. Right on cue, we could hear him crying and Chad and his wife audibly groaned. Chad then asked me to go take care of the baby so he and his wife could go to sleep. I told him like hell and gave him the middle finger before leaving and slamming the door. From another relative, I heard that they had a big argument and his wife is currently staying with her parents. Her parents also had a change of heart towards him. Now he's claiming that I made him say that on purpose, which is ridiculous. I smell a divorce in the future.

When I was 17, my mom forced me to start babysitting, but I had no idea who I was doing it for. When I met this woman, I couldn't believe how overprotective she was. She had cameras in every room of the house and asked me to call her every half hour just to make sure her daughter was okay. She told me I wasn't allowed to do anything except watch her. And when she finally left, I basically just sat there for three hours doing nothing until she came home. She came back and basically ran into the room to make sure the girl was okay and I assured her everything was fine. I had long hair at the time and had put it up at this point. And should probably now mention I have severe hearing loss. I have to wear hearing aids, which can usually be easily mistaken for headphones. Then as I was standing up to say bye to the girl, her mom noticed them in my ears. She thought I was wearing headphones the whole time and wasn't paying attention to the little girl. This made her furious and a second later, I felt her grab my head. All I remember was feeling the worst pain I've ever felt in my ear. I turned around to see her holding my hearing aid and realized what she did. She thought I was listening to music, so she ripped my hearing Aid out of my ear thinking it was a headphone. And since they connect directly to my eardrum, she completely ripped that out, too. The pain was so intense I passed out and woke up in the hospital to my mom crying. She was livid. And even though they begged us not to, we sued her. I will never hear out of my ear again, but I'll never have to work again either.

My parents never planned to have another kid after Abby. She was their perfect little girl. Smart as hell. Played piano like Mozart, made honor roll every semester. But when she got hit by that drunk driver at age 8, everything changed. Nine months later, boom, there I was. I grew up thinking I lived in a museum, not a house. Abby's room stayed exactly how she left it. Her bed made perfectly, her soccer trophies lined up on the shelf. Even her stupid math homework still pinned to the bulletin board. Nobody was allowed in there, not even me. My parents acted like they were babysitting someone else's kid when I was around. They take maybe three photos of me a year. And that was being generous. My birthdays were these weird, quiet affairs where mom would make a cake and we'd all sit there eating it in silence. No friends, no parties, nothing. Every July, they pack their bags and disappear for a week to visit Abby's grave. They drop me off at Mrs. Henderson's house next door and act like I didn't exist. Mrs. Henderson was nice enough, but I always wondered why I couldn't come with them to see my own sister. When I turned thirteen, I finally asked dad about Abby during dinner. Big mistake. His fork hit the plate so hard, I thought it cracked. She was perfect, he snapped, not even looking. At me, you don't get to ask about her. Mom just stared at her food like it was the most interesting thing in the world. That's when it hit me. I wasn't their son. I was their do over. Their second chance at getting what they really wanted. High school was brutal. I'd watch other kids complain about their parents being too involved, too loud at games, too embarrassing. Meanwhile, mine forgot to show up to my graduation. They said they had to work late, but I saw dad's car in the driveway when I got home. That's when I started writing letters to Abby. Not because I believed in ghosts or anything, but because I needed to understand what made her so damn special that my parents couldn't love anyone else. Dear Abby, I wrote one night, I know you were awesome and everything, but I'm tired of living in your shadow. They wish you never died, and they wish I was never born. But here I am anyway. I left that letter taped to the attic door where they kept all her stuff. I figured if they wanted to worship their dead daughter so much, they might as well read what their living son had to say. The next morning, I found a dusty photo album slid under my bedroom door. No note, no explanation. Just this old book filled with baby pictures. My

At my engagement dinner, she spent the night telling Nathan's family how she introduced us, even though they met at work. Cancer diagnosis was just another moment for her to steal. Two days after my diagnosis, Savannah moved into our house without asking. She made a Caringbridge page but wrote everything from her perspective. Every post started with how hard it was for her to watch me suffer. Friends praised her dedication while I spent hours throwing up from chemo. Three weeks in, I asked if Nathan could drive me to appointment, sometimes started crying and said I was pushing her away during the hardest time of her life. She posted about how sick people lash out at caregivers. Nathan said I should apologize. By month 2, she reorganized our entire house. I moved Nathan's things to the guest room and started screening my calls. She turned away visitors saying stress would hurt my recovery. She joined Nathan for evening runs to discuss my care. They'd come back sweaty and avoid eye contact. Four months into treatment, my white count dropped and the nurse sent me home early. I Took an Uber because Savannah had our car for shopping. I heard voices from our bedroom and climbed the stairs slowly. When I opened the door, they were in my bed. Savannah was wearing the anniversary pajamas Nathan bought me. She, I jumped up wearing my robe and rushed over with fake concern. She asked why I was home early and said I must be confused from the medications. She actually told Nathan to call my nurse about hallucinations. He just sat there in his boxers while she performed. My legs gave out. I slid down the door frame, realizing she'd stolen my husband while I was fighting cancer. Nathan finally said, I've been distant and Savannah understood his stress better. He compared his stress to my cancer. They moved out next week. Savannah told everyone I'd become paranoid from treatment. She posted about watching loved ones lose themselves to illness. People praised her for setting boundaries. Most friends believed her. I finished three months of treatment alone. No one cheered when I rang the bell. I recorded it myself but deleted it that night on my bathroom floor. I decided Savannah had stolen from me my whole life. This time would be different. During recovery, I studied Savannah's patterns like I was planning a battle. I made fake social media accounts to track her posts and learn her routines. Found out she had joined a fancy yoga studio and was flirting with her married instructor. She worked at a Marketing firm downtown and volunteered for their charity events. She and Nathan had rented a condo near the river. I mapped out her entire life and looked for weak spots. I joined her yoga studio but went to different class times, became friends with the instructor's wife at the juice bar next door. We bonded over books and recovery stories without me mentioning Savannah. When Savannah started asking for private sessions, his wife was already suspicious. She found on their text messages and confronted Savannah in the packed studio lobby. She read every flirty message out loud. While Savannah tried to cry her way out, the entire studio turned against her. Next, I joined the board of her company's charity foundation as a cancer survivor advocate. At their annual gala, I gave a speech about finding strength during treatment. I started by describing the loneliness of chemo and how cancer strips away fake.

My 12 year old daughter Adeline takes the bus home from school every day. She's always been chatty about her day. But last week something changed. She started mentioning this nice man who always sits behind her and asks about her homework, her friends, what she likes to do after school. Red flags everywhere. At first I thought maybe she was just being friendly. But then Adeline said he'd complimented her hair and asked if she walked home alone from the bus stop. When she told me he knew which stop was hers, even though he never got off there, my stomach dropped. I decided to follow the bus route in my car the next afternoon. Sure enough, there's this guy in his 40s who gets on at the stop right after Adeline's school. He's not dressed like someone heading to work, no briefcase, no uniform, just sitting there in a baseball cap watching the kids. Followed the bus for three stops. He never got off, just rode it to the end of the route, then walked back to his car parked at the school. When Adeline told me he'd offered her candy and asked where exactly we lived, including what our house looked like, I knew I had to act fast. Next morning I called in sick to work and got on that bus myself, sat three rows behind him with sunglasses and a hoodie up. Adeline didn't even notice. Me boarding. I watched him scan every kid getting on, but his eyes locked on Adeline the moment she stepped up those bus steps. He immediately moved to the seat directly behind her and started his routine. How was school today, sweetheart? Did you think about what I said yesterday about our little secret? Adeline looked uncomfortable but was trying to be polite. Um, I guess so. Good girl. Smart girls like you deserve special treats. Maybe we could meet up sometime when your parents aren't around. I know a place near your house where we could talk. That's when I stood up. Walk.

My boyfriend Jake had this super important work party coming up. He kept telling me how fancy it was and how I needed to look good for his boss and co workers. He even said his promotion might depend on making the right impression. I went shopping and found this gorgeous red dress at Nordstrom. It was classy, but had a little slit up the side. Perfect for a fancy company event, right? The day of the party, I spent hours getting ready. Did my hair, makeup, nails, the whole thing. When Jake saw me, he froze. He looked me up and down and said the dress was too much. I asked what he meant, and he said it was too flashy for his work people. I was confused because it wasn't even that revealing. He suggested I change into something more conservative, but we were already running late, so I said I'd be fine. He got quiet and weird in the car, checking his phone constantly. When we got to the hotel ballroom, I immediately noticed something was off. All the other women were dressed super plain, like boring black dresses and beige pantsuits. I looked around and realized I was the only one wearing anything with color or style. Jake introduced me to his boss, Mr. Williams, who seems nice enough. But then I met his co workers and their wives. They were all giving Me these weird looks and whispering to each other. One woman, Janet, came up and asked where I got my dress. I told her Nordstrom. She said, oh, that's expensive, and walked away. During dinner, I overheard two wives talking behind me. One said something about how some people try too hard to get attention. The other laughed and said, young girls these days don't know how to dress appropriately. I realised they were talking about me. My face turned hot with embarrassment. Jake barely talked to me all night. He kept checking his work phone and avoiding eye contact. When I tried to join conversations, people would smile politely then change the subject. I felt like everyone was judging me for my dress choice. During the award ceremony, I excused myself to the bathroom. In the bathroom, I ran into another woman around my age. She introduced herself as Lisa and said she was there with her husband.

Nathan and I dated for three years before I realised he was cheating with his coworker Michelle from the marketing department. When I found out, I packed my stuff that same night, blocked him on every social media platform, and moved across town to start fresh. I deleted his number, threw away his hoodies, and promised myself I'd never look back. Six months later, I'm marrying David, the kindest man I've ever met. We met at a coffee shop where he was reading the same obscure philosophy book I was. He's patient, thoughtful, and treats me like I'm worth everything. Perfect ceremony. Beautiful venue with white roses everywhere. All our friends and family there watching us exchange vows under the stained glass windows. My bridesmaids look stunning in their sage green dresses. My mom is crying happy tears in the front row. David's grandmother flew in from Italy just for this moment. Everything is absolutely perfect, right? As Pastor Williams asks if. If anyone objects to this union, Nathan bursts through the heavy oak doors wearing a wrinkled navy suit that looks like he slept in it. I have to stop this! He shouts dramatically, strutting down the aisle like he's the main character in some romantic comedy. Audrey, you're making a huge mistake marrying this guy! Everyone gasps audibly. My bridesmaids look horrified, mouths hanging open. David squeezes my hand. Supportively whispering, it's okay. We got this. Love you. Nathan reaches the altar, breathing heavily from his dramatic entrance, sweat beating on his forehead. This woman is a complete fraud. She's been lying to all of you about who she really is. Pastor Williams tries to stay composed, adjusting his wire rimmed glasses. Sir, this is highly inappropriate. Please leave immediately or I'll call security. No, they need to know the truth. Nathan interrupts, gesturing wildly with his hands. Audrey told me she was saving herself for marriage, but I have proof she's been with other men. She's not the pure Christian girl she pretends to be. She's a liar! A few people gasp. My aunt clutches her pearls. One of the groomsmen mutters, bro, this isn't high school. Even the flower girl looks up like, what is this man doing? The church goes dead silent. You could hear a pin drop. I feel my face burning with embarrassment. My mom looks mortified in the front row, her hands covering her mouth. David's family looks confused and uncomfortable. That's when Pastor Williams completely loses it. He starts laughing so hard he's doubled over, tears streaming down his face, shoulder shaking uncontrollably. The sound echoes through the church. Nathan looks confused, his confidence wavering for the first time. What's so funny? This is serious. I'm trying to save her from making a mistake. Pastor Williams catches his breath, wiping his eyes with his handkerchief. Son, are you talking about my daughter? Audrey Nathan nods confidently, puffing out

When I was pregnant, my boyfriend Jake and I had the typical fights about baby names. He wanted something trendy like Harper or Paisley. I kept pushing for Margaret. He'd roll his eyes every time I brought it up and say stuff like, babe, that's such an old lady name. Or do you want our kid to get bullied? But here's the thing. Jake didn't know Margaret wasn't random to me. It was my grandmother's name and she basically raised me when my mom was too busy getting high to take care of a kid. Margaret taught me how to tie my shoes, helped with homework, made me grilled cheese when I was sick. She was the only stable thing in my whole chaotic childhood. Jake never met her because she passed away two years before we started dating. I tried explaining the connection once, but he just brushed it off and said, well, can't we honor her with the middle name instead? I dropped it because fighting while pregnant seemed pointless. So when our daughter was born and the nurse asked for the name, I looks Jake dead in the eyes and said, Margaret Rose. He literally went pale. The nurse was writing it down before he could even process what happened. Are you serious right now, he whispered. I just shrugged and said, I told you I liked it. For weeks after, people kept giving me these looks when I'd introduce Baby Margaret. My sister flat out asked if I was trying to make my kids life harder. Even the pediatrician seemed confused when he called out Margaret in the waiting room and a tiny baby showed up. But then something weird happened. When Margaret was about 6 months old, we were at the grocery store and this elderly woman behind us in line heard me talking to her. She got this huge smile and said, oh, my goodness, Mark, that was my best friend's name growing up. Such a beautiful, strong name. Then when Margaret started daycare, her teacher, Mrs. Chen, told me it was refreshing to see a classic name. Apparently she was getting tired of having three Aydens and four Madisons in every class. The real kicker came when Margaret turned 2. We were at a family barbecue and my great aunt pulled me aside. She said, you know, your grandmother would be so proud you named your daughter after her. I was confused because I'd never told anyone the real reason.

So I introduced her to someone who ruined her life. I was given a built in boyfriend thief when my younger sister Ashley was born. And I'm not talking about borrowed hoodies or flirty glances. I mean it. Like if I brought home a boyfriend, she'd have him in her bed within a month. If I introduced someone at dinner, she'd already be texting him under the table. If I posted an anniversary photo, she'd somehow end up accidentally running into him at his gym. People said she got Mom's looks and I got Dad's personality. It started very small, almost innocent. Even like when my high school boyfriend suddenly wanted to study at our house all the time, Ashley would walk by in towels asking him for homework help. I didn't see it then since I trusted them both. But by the time we hit our 20s, it got calculated. I dated Shane for six months before introducing him to my family. One week after that dinner, Ashley had a crisis and needed his shoulder to cry on at 2:00am. They slept together that night. Next came Julio from my accounting firm. The pattern repeated, family dinner, sudden emergency, midnight comfort. When I confronted her after finding their texts, she tilted her head and smiled. I'm just making sure they're good enough for you. Julio failed the test. And honestly, I agreed if they would leave me for my sister, they Weren't the right one for me. Then came Seth, who I dated for two years. We talk about getting married after I finished my teaching degree. Ashley got too drunk at the birthday party I'd thrown him and kissed him in front of everyone. When he chose her, she posted, sometimes you can't help who you fall for. Sorry, not sorry. Mom pulled me aside at Thanksgiving, voice sharp. You need to stop bringing these men around. Ashley can't control herself when you parade them in front of her. Why do you keep tempting her? In my head, I hadn't tempted anyone. Three months later, I met Adam at a friend's wedding down in Portland. He was everything and successful and apparently loyal. For eight months, I kept him completely secret. We dated in different towns, avoided social media and told absolutely no one. I thought I'd finally won because this was the best, best relationship I had ever been in until my cousin accidentally mentioned him to mom who mentioned him to Ashley. She found him within days through his company website. I walked into his apartment with the key he'd given me and found them together in our bed. But the worst part came when Ashley sat up still naked and said, I did you a favor. He barely lasted 10 minutes. You deserve better, sis. Adam just shrugged, your sister is way too hot for me not to try. I stood there shaking while she gathered her Clothes, kissing him goodbye like I wasn't even there. That's when I decided to give Ashley exactly what she craved. Man she couldn't resist but definitely should. I spent weeks searching through court records and police databases. That's how I found Wayne, a gorgeous, charming man who claimed to be a venture capitalist from Boston, recently divorced after his ex wife documented years of financial and physical abuse. Two restraining orders from other exes. Under investigation for fraud, court documents showed he'd hidden assets, forged signatures and manipulated multiple women into debt. Perfect. I created a fake LinkedIn profile as a potential investor and reached out to him. We met for business Coffee where I mentioned my beautiful sister who always stole my boyfriend's and showed him her Instagram, said that I could never find love. His eyes lit up at the ability to control me because no one gave me a chance. Very quickly, things progressed and I told him I was trying to keep my new relationship secret from her and invited him as my date to Mom's birthday dinner. Knowing exactly what would happen. He thought he was playing me and I would be his next new victim. And at first he played it.

So my daughter Emma is 15 and has been dating this kid, Noah, for about four months now. Every time they go out, Noah pays movies, dinner, ice cream, even when Emma wants to grab something from the gas station. At first I figured, whatever, teenage boys like to show off. But then I started hearing conversations between Emma and my wife where my wife would literally say things like, oh, honey, that's so sweet. He's such a gentleman and you should never have to pay when you're with a boy. Last week was when it really hit me. Emma comes home talking about how Noah spent 40 bucks taking her to some fancy burger place downtown. I asked her if she offered to split it. And she looked at me like I had three heads. She goes, dad, why would I do that? Mom says boys are supposed to pay for dates. I confronted my wife about it that night and she got all defensive, started going on about how it's traditional and romantic and how Noah's family has money anyway, so it's fine. I told her she's basically teaching our daughter to be a gold digger. And that shut down the conversation real quick. But it kept happening. Emma would come home bragging about expensive stuff Noah bought her a new phone case. Some jewelry, taking her to the movies every weekend. The kid was probably spending his entire part time job paycheck on my daughter. Things got really bad when Emma mentioned wanting to go to homecoming. She starts talking about the dress she wants, which costs like $200, casually mentions that Noah said he'd buy it for her along with paying for dinner in the limo. I asked her how much all of that would cost and she just shrugged and said, I don't know. That's Noah's problem. That's when I lost it. I sat both Emma and my wife down and told them this had to stop. I explained that Noah is a 16 year old kid working at a grocery store making minimum wage, not some sugar daddy. Emma got all upset and said I was being mean and that all her friends, boyfriends pay for everything, too. My wife backed her up saying I was being old fashioned and that it's normal for boys to want to spoil their girlfriends. I told them both they were living in fantasy land and that Emma needed to start contributing to dates or I'd have a conversation with Noah's parents about what was happening. The whole thing came to a head when Noah's mom called me last week. Turns out the poor kid had been stressed about money and finally told his parents he was spending everything he earned on Emma. His mom was really nice about it, but.

My husband always said he'd do anything to become a father, but I never imagined anything including my younger sister. We've been trying for three years. Every negative test felt like a tiny funeral while Mark sat beside me scrolling adoption sites like shopping online, sighing louder with each click. When my sister Emma offered to be our surrogate at Thanksgiving, I thought we caught a break. She'd already had two kids. I do anything for you, she said, squeezing my hand. Family helps family. I watched Mark's eyes meet hers across the table. That should have been my first warning. The fertility clinic quoted us $30,000 for IVF with surrogacy. Mark started a spreadsheet, calculating interest rates, loan options and even selling his motorcycle. Then one night over Chinese takeout, he sat down his chopsticks and said, what if we did it the traditional way? I laughed. What do you mean traditional? He leaned forward, completely serious. We skip the IVF. I just plant my seed directly in Emma. No medical costs, no procedures, same result. My chopsticks clattered to the table. He kept going, launching into this whole speech about efficiency and saving money, how people did it for centuries, how it would be clinical and quick, just a medical procedure without the medical bills. He said, I couldn't speak. I was too busy trying to process that my husband Had just asked to bang my sister. The guilt trip started immediately. I guess you don't really want kids. Other wives would understand the sacrifice. He even compared me to his coworker Janet, who'd done egg donation for her sister. Each comment was designed to make me feel selfish for saying no. By Week 3, Emma called me. Mark explained everything, she said, voice dripping with concern. I want you to know I'm open to it, whatever helps you become a mom. She went on about how it would be beautiful creating life for her sister and how the baby would be loved by everyone. I thanked her but said I wasn't sure yet and hung up. Then came the Thursday that changed everything. Mark was at his brother's bachelor party and I needed our insurance card for a dentist appointment. I searched his home office, rifling through his file filling cabinet and behind the tax returns, I found a Manila folder labeled medical. Inside were test results from two years before we married. Male factor infertility. Sperm count 0, completely sterile. My hands shook reading the urologist notes. Genital irreversible, no surgical options. He'd known every fertility appointment where he'd held my hand while doctors explained how my body was failing us every time I sobbed over negative tests. He knew he was the problem. I kept digging and opened his computer to see what else he might be hiding and saw text with my sister going back six Months. They talked about how once I agreed to the surrogacy, they wouldn't have to sneak around anymore, how this was really going to work and how they'd finally have a daughter of their own and make leaving me easy. They were actually joking about how simple their plan was. Emma wrote, she'll probably thank us for taking the burden off her. With a laughing emoji. Mark replied that they'd tell our families the baby needed her biological mom, that the child couldn't bond with me properly. We'll look like we're doing what's best for the baby. He'd written, for stealing my life one text at a time. I could have left right then and there and dodged the biggest bullet of a lifetime, but what's the fun in that? So I called the one person he despised most, his older brother, Ryan, Harvard MBA investment banker. Daddy's favorite market's been our entire marriage. Making snide comments about Mister Perfect and trying to one up every story about Ryan's success. I laid it all out to Ryan, who just said, Jesus. Even for Mark, that's evil. When I told him I had an idea but needed his help, he didn't even hesitate. Whatever you're thinking, I'm in. From then on, I started acting defeated. I told Mark over breakfast, you're right, we should be practical about this. His whole face lit up like his plan was finally working. Later that same night, I asked Mark to meet me at home. For an important conversation. When he arrived, I was sitting calmly on the couch. I've been thinking about your suggestion about doing things tradition, I said. Mark leaned forward eagerly and, well, I found someone. We've already started trying. His face went white. What do you mean trying? You're infertile. Who? Oh, didn't I mention? Turns out I'm perfectly fertile. Just needed someone with working equipment. Called upstairs. You can come down now. Ryan walked down, adjusting his tie. Hey, little brother, thanks for the practical suggestion. I pulled out his fertility report and laid it out for him. Why are you upset? You're sterile. You've always been sterile. I held up my phone. Oh, and I just sent Emma your fertility report. All those promises about babies, she's finding out right now that you can't deliver. His jaw dropped as his phone started buzzing frantically. Came at me and said, you ruined my life. But Ryan was already dragging him toward the door. I filed for divorce the next morning and it was finalized after six months. Emma dumped him the moment she found out he was sterile and Mark lost everything. I'm focusing on myself now and honestly, I've never been happier. But I still think about Mark lying awake at night, wondering if his perfect brother really did screw his wife and when I might be expecting his brother's baby. I hope the thought eats him alive.

I'm not usually the type to clap back on social media. I'm the neighbor who brings cookies to new move ins and returns lost packages that Amazon drops at the wrong house. But everyone has a breaking point. And mine came at 1:00am on a Thursday when some jackass decided to celebrate America with fireworks while the rest of us were trying to sleep. I love fireworks on the fourth of July, New Year's Eve, hell even random Saturdays and summer. But Thursday at 1:00am when I had to drive two hours for an 8:00am meeting? That's just being an asshole. My dogs went ballistic, I went from dead sleep to fighter flight mode, and my alarm was set for 4:00am. So yeah, I was pissed. After my meeting. Exhausted and running on gas station coffee. I posted in our neighborhood Facebook group to whoever set off fireworks at 1:00am. Some of us have jobs. There's a time and place. Thursday morning. Isn't it simple enough? Right? I wasn't even that harsh. Then this guy, let's call him Brad because he looks like every Brad who peaked in high school. Commented maybe you can't sleep because you're a fat pig. Just like that. No context, no reason, just pure cruelty from a stranger. His profile showed a guy in his late 30s with a wife, two kids, and a bio about family. Values the kind of guy who posts Bible verses on Sunday and your body, my choice memes on Monday. Here's the thing. I just lost 50 pounds. I was feeling better than I had in years, finally comfortable in my own skin, and this random douchebag decided to take a shot at me for no reason. He didn't even set off the fireworks, which I found out later were from teenagers three blocks over. He just saw an opportunity to be cruel and took it. The comment sat there getting laugh reacts from his buddies while I stared at it during my drive home. That's when something shifted. I could have reported it, blocked him, been the bigger person. Instead, I clicked on his profile. Brad Williams, married to Karen Williams for 12 years. Tons of couple photos, anniversary posts, whole blessed wife performance. Then I had an idea that would either be genius or get me blocked from the group. But after being called a fat pig in front of 500 neighbors, I was ready to risk it. I typed my response carefully, making sure to use his first name. Listen, Brad, I'm sorry I had to end things between us, but I just didn't have the same feelings. What you're saying now is hurtful. Please stop messaging me and commenting on my posts. I told you a dozen times already, we're done. It's over. And I immediately left for a cruise I booked months ago. Seven and days No internet, no cell service. Just me and my best friend drinking overpriced margaritas and forgetting Brad Williams existed. I figured worst case, I'd come back to being kicked out of the group. Best case, his wife would see it, and he'd have some explaining to do. I didn't expect what actually happened. When I finally got Wi-Fi again in Cosamel, my phone exploded. 47 Facebook messages, 23 friend requests, 186 notifications. My cousin had texted, girl, what did you do? 17 times I opened Facebook to find my inbox flooded. Karen Williams had sent 12 increasingly frantic messages asking for details about my relationship with her husband. Brad had sent several, calling me a lying bitch and threatening legal action. But the real treasure was a message from someone named Jessica saying she was also sleeping with Brad and thought she was the only mistress. Apparently, my comment had lit a fuse. Karen saw it within an hour, confronted Brad, and in his panic to deny knowing me, he'd accidentally revealed he had a secret Instagram account. Karen found that account, which LED to finding Jessica, which LED to finding out about someone named Ashley, and the whole house of cards came tumbling down. By day three of my cruise, two more women had come forward. Brad's little fat pig comment had started an avalanche that revealed four affairs spanning six years. Neighborhood Facebook group was better than Reality TV. Karen posted a photo of Brad's stuff in garbage. Bags on the lawn. Jessica showed up at their house demanding answers. Ashley leaked his nudes to the group before admin could delete them. Brad kept making new accounts to defend himself, each one getting blocked faster than the last final post before disappearing completely. That fat bitch ruined my life with her lies. Last I heard, Karen divorced him and Brad's living in his brother's basement. And I only know this because Karen told me everything herself when she invited me to her girls night. Sip and paint. She sent the message, you have to come, fatty. With a crying laughing emoji. We had an awesome time painting wine bottles and sharing Brad's most embarrassing bedroom secrets. I'm down 54 pounds and sleep like a baby now. Turns out I wasn't the pig after all.

Now he's trapped in his own mess. I was adopted and my foster parents treated me like their own kid and their kids treated me like their sibling, except for Chad. Chad was an insensitive a hole to everyone. He would fight our older sister, say horrible things to everyone. And his anger issues caused him to break doors and punch holes in walls. The worst thing was when he got up in front of our whole class year and told them I wasn't his sister and never would be. He claimed I would never be a part of his family and I should stop trying. He would keep doing this up until he moved out and I stopped talking to him. I have stayed as far away from him as possible, only seeing him for family pictures every year because our mother asks. Recently he got married and had a baby and everyone was congratulating him except for me. Our mom noticed and asked why I was distancing myself from him. I told her about high school and she said this is still my kid and it's my first grandbaby. And it was the reason she wasn't going to be upset over it. I knew that would happen. Out of nowhere, I got a message from Chad begging me to go babysit for Them because you're the only one who can deal with these kinds of babies because no one will help. He knows I have insomnia and that's why I don't mind staying up. I can't tell if that's a blessing or a curse at this point. For some reason, I accepted and went over at eight PM when I showed up, I was greeted by Chad's wife who had the biggest eye bags but still greeted me with a smile. She explained the baby's night route feedings and said they would be home around 12:30 at most. After this, Chad showed up, looked at me for over a minute and gave me a small wave, then left the house. His wife followed and told me to call or text if I needed anything. For a minute, I was just stunned but went to take care of the baby. He was fine the whole time. And then twelve thirty PM rolled around, but they weren't home. I decided to wait and then ended up texting them at one asking where they were. I got no reply from either of them. They finally showed up at 3 in the morning. I'm livid at this point. I walked into the living room and told them I was waiting for their response. Chad's wife said, oh, Chad said it was fine and that it would only be an hour more. I cut her off to say, it's fine, whatever, the baby's sleeping. I thought I Could walk out of there with my head held high. But when I walked past Chad, I blurted out, so you aren't going to say anything to me after I looked after your kid for seven hours? He snorted at me and was like, no, my wife is the one who talked me into this. Pissed off, I said, so this wasn't a way to apologize for high school or all those other times you outcast me from the family because I was under the impression that you'd want to patch things up? He snapped back, why should I apologize? Nothing from high school has changed. You really do need to just grow up and understand that me and my wife aren't going to cater to you like mom and dad did because you're adopted. You ain't our family and you won't ever be. I turned to his wife and told her she married a disgusting piece of crap and if he continues to act this way, his son will grow up to hate him, too. One day she'll resent him for what he is and she'll only have herself to blame. Chad got angry and said, I had no right to talk to her like that when not even my real family wanted me. I reminded him that his wife also has an adopted sister, told her that if this was the way he spoke about me, then what did she think he was saying about her sister? He Surely wasn't treating her like a princess. I could see that I was getting through to her. But then Chad punched a wall. Classic Chad. I screamed not out of fear, but because I wanted to wake the baby up out of pure spitefulness. Right on cue, we could hear him crying and Chad and his wife audibly groaned. Chad then asked me to go take care of the baby so he and his wife could go to sleep. I told him like hell and gave him the middle finger before leaving and slamming the door. From another relative, I heard that they had a big argument and his wife is currently staying with her parents. Her parents also had a change of heart towards him. Now he's claiming that I made him say that on purpose, which is ridiculous. I smell a divorce in the future.

When I was 17, my mom forced me to start babysitting, but I had no idea who I was doing it for. When I met this woman, I couldn't believe how overprotective she was. She had cameras in every room of the house and asked me to call her every half hour just to make sure her daughter was okay. She told me I wasn't allowed to do anything except watch her. And when she finally left, I basically just sat there for three hours doing nothing until she came home. She came back and basically ran into the room to make sure the girl was okay and I assured her everything was fine. I had long hair at the time and had put it up at this point. And should probably now mention I have severe hearing loss. I have to wear hearing aids, which can usually be easily mistaken for headphones. Then as I was standing up to say bye to the girl, her mom noticed them in my ears. She thought I was wearing headphones the whole time and wasn't paying attention to the little girl. This made her furious and a second later, I felt her grab my head. All I remember was feeling the worst pain I've ever felt in my ear. I turned around to see her holding my hearing aid and realized what she did. She thought I was listening to music, so she ripped my hearing Aid out of my ear thinking it was a headphone. And since they connect directly to my eardrum, she completely ripped that out, too. The pain was so intense I passed out and woke up in the hospital to my mom crying. She was livid. And even though they begged us not to, we sued her. I will never hear out of my ear again, but I'll never have to work again either.

What did you consider intimate? I didn't know families hugged until I was 19. In my house, we lived like roommates who hated each other. Nobody talked, nobody touched. Nobody said I love you, ever. When I cried, I did it alone. When I got sick, my mom left medicine on the counter and walked away. I thought this was normal. Then I met a family that broke me. My college roommate, Kara, invited me home for Thanksgiving. I typed three different excuses before deleting them. She'd been trying to be my friend since September. When I told my parents, they only asked what time I'd be back Sunday, nothing else. But Kara kept insisting. Her mom already bought extra food. I had no good reason to say no. Walking into Kara's house, I had no idea I was about to discover what I've been missing my entire life. Her mom hugged me at the door. Not a quick pat, a real hug. Three full seconds. My whole body went rigid, like she was attacking me. I didn't know where to put my hands, so I just stood there with my arms pinned to my sides like an idiot. At dinner, they went around the table sharing their days on purpose, like they actually wanted to hear each other talk. When Kara's brother said he failed his history test, I literally braced myself for the uncomfortable silence. Instead, his dad put down his fork. And said, man, that sucks. Tell me what happened. And then they all just. He listened to him. The whole family stopped eating to help him feel better. I sat there confused, waiting for someone to tell him to try harder or stop whining. Nobody did. When Kara's mom burned the rolls, he laughed about it, got distracted thinking about dessert. Everyone started teasing her, and she laughed even harder. I kept waiting for someone to storm off or slam something at my house. Burning food meant my dad would eat in his car and my mom would bang cabinets. For a week, these people were laughing. Then I noticed something that made my chest feel weird. Kara's hand on her mom's shoulder. Her dad ruffling her brother's hair. Everyone piling on one couch even though there were other seats. I pressed myself against the armrest, trying not to accidentally touch anyone, because in my house, physical contact meant someone was either really angry or someone died. After dinner, Kara and her mom were doing dishes, just chatting, and her mom said, I'm proud of how you handled Professor Williams. Kara hadn't even brought it up. Her mom just knew about it and cared. My throat got tight watching them. The next morning, Kara walked in and announced she was anxious about her paper. Her dad literally stopped making coffee to listen to her talk about her feelings for 15 minutes straight. He helped her make a plan. Nobody told Her. She was being dramatic. I sat there with my cereal getting soggy because I couldn't process what I was watching. But that night destroyed me completely. Through the walls, I heard them saying, good night. Love you, mom. Love you, too, sweetheart. Night, dad. Love you. Love you more, kiddo. Every single night. Like breathing. I laid there shaking, trying to remember one time my parents said those words. Nothing. These people said, I love you every day. And my family couldn't even say good job. I never told Kara about my family. When her mom asked about our Thanksgiving traditions twice, I changed the subject. Both times, my hands were literally shaking. She stopped asking, but squeezed my shoulder. When I sat back down, I almost lost it right there. At breakfast on my last morning, Kara's dad asked if my parents minded me being gone for the holiday. Said they were fine with it. And he exchanged this look with Kara's mom. Not a mean look. More like they were figuring something out about me that I didn't want them to know. When Kara's mom drove me to the bus station, she turned the radio down halfway there. Listen, honey, you're welcome here anytime. Any holiday, any weekend. Or just because. I stared at my hands because I knew if I looked at her, I'd start crying. Before I got out, she hugged me way longer than necessary. When she pulled back, her eyes were watery. You Deserve to be loved, sweetheart. I hope you know that. I literally couldn't speak. Nobody had ever said that to me before. That visit broke me open. I started small. Asked friends how they were and actually listened. Said thank you and meant it. Called the campus counseling center. Hung up twice before booking. Three months later, I told someone I love you for the first time. They said it back. And I didn't die.

I didn't know guys will just stand in the shower for 10 minutes doing nothing, no water running, just standing there like they're waiting for a download to finish. The first time I walked in on it, I thought something was wrong. He looked at me all calm and said, I'm just mentally preparing. I've never looked at showers the same way. 2. I found out men treat fridges like treasure hunts. He'll open it five times in a row, stare like something new is going to spawn, sigh dramatically, and then eat plain cheese straight from the block. I once asked why he keeps checking. He said, in case a snack magically appears. Three, I didn't know guys hum to themselves during the most random tasks. My boyfriend will be cleaning the sink, humming what sounds like boss battle music, then suddenly switch to singing about how this sponge is my sword. I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said, but it still smells like me, so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said, because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6, 10. They make sound effects for everything, opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7, they'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8, they'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes. And apparently that's normal to them. 9, they'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car, groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10, they can sit in total silence for an hour staring at the wall. And when you ask what they're thinking about, they say nothing. And somehow they really mean nothing.

Aria was the girl who'd throw any girl under the bus for five seconds of male approval. Since freshman year, everyone knew Aria as the girl who'd loudly announced she only hung out with guys because girls are too much drama. She'd sit at the guys table, laugh at every sexist joke louder than anyone else and somehow convinced herself that calling other girls too sensitive made her special. The crazy part was the guys ate it up. Even teachers thought Aria was refreshingly laid back compared to other girls. I remember this one time in P E. When a girl complained about the boys snapping girls bra straps. Aria actually stood up and said, it's just guys being guys. Stop being such a baby about it. The male coach literally thanked her for being rational. That was Aria's whole thing. She was the cool girl who got it. She'd brag about watching porn with the guys, rate other girls bodies with them and called feminism victim mentality. Girls who tried to call out inappropriate behavior became her targets. He'd mock them with fake crying sounds, post their complaints on social media to ridicule them and loudly proclaim how she wasn't like those uptight bitches who couldn't take a joke. During junior year when Natalie recorded getting groped at a party, Aria was the first to say Natalie was probably asking for it wearing that dress. Guys would high five her. Call her basically a dude with tits and she'd beam like she'd won the lottery. When we all came back on Monday after spring break of senior year, we were preparing for the moment Aria went off on a girl and snickered with one of her guy friends. But first period arrives and Aria walks past the guys table without even glancing at them. Not like avoiding them. Aria just walked past like they didn't exist. She sits down at a table full of girls, the same girls she'd spent three years mocking. Vivian, who she'd called a dramatic princess. Audrey, who she labeled attention seeking for reporting harassment. Natalie, whose reputation she tried to destroy. The guys started calling her over. Yo, Aria, we saved your spot. She didn't even turn her head. It was like she'd gone deaf to male voices. At first, everyone thought it was some weird joke. Maybe she lost a bet over spring break. Maybe this was some elaborate prank that would turn into the ultimate pick me moment. We were on the edge of our seats waiting for her to burst out yelling, I was right, girls are too much drama. But Aria kept sitting with the girls. She stopped responding to the guys texts, unfollowed all of them on every platform. When Ethan tried to talk to her after chemistry, she looked right through him and kept walking. Days turned into weeks. Guys went from confused to angry. They started spreading rumors. That Aria was on her period, that she turned into a crazy feminist overnight, that she was probably a lesbian now. They tried everything to get a reaction. Nothing. Aria just kept sitting with the girls, actually listening when they talked, not interrupting to defend male behavior. The girls were suspicious at first. This had to be some long con to gather gossip for the boys. But Aria never brought up the guys, never defended them. When Jade mentioned feeling uncomfortable about something her boyfriend said, Aria actually responded with, that's not okay. You deserve better. Everyone's jaws broke the floor. Then we all found out what happened. It was so much worse than anyone imagined. Audrey revealed what she'd heard from her older brother, who went to college with Ethan's brother. During spring break, there'd been a huge party at Ethan's house while his parents were gone. Yeah, had gone, got drunk and crashed in the guest room. The next morning, she'd woken up early and went to find her phone. Ethan's laptop was open on the kitchen counter, and the screen was on a group chat. A group chat with every single guy she hung out with, plus dozens from other schools. The chat was called the Spank Bank. Arya had scrolled up.

When Tom told me Linda was gone, I thought we'd finally have peace. Those kids, Emma and Jake, had been living with us every other weekend since we got married. But now they were ours full time. And honestly, I was excited. I've been buying them school supplies, taking them to soccer practice, helping with homework while their mom barely showed up to games. The funeral was weird. Tom cried more than I'd seen in our whole relationship. Emma kept asking when mom was coming back, and Jake just sat there staring. I held their hands during the service, thinking about how we'd need bunk beds and a bigger car. Two days later, Tom got a call from Linda's lawyer. She'd left everything to Tom and her will. The house, her savings, her car, even custody. But here's the thing nobody expected. She also left a letter explaining why. Tom read it out loud while the kids were at school. I know I wasn't the best mom. I know you guys gave them to. Really, I couldn't. But I need them to understand something about their real father. My stomach dropped. Real father? Tom went white as paper. Turns out, Linda had been lying for six years. Tom wasn't Emma and Jake's biological dad. Some guy named Ryan from her college was. He'd been getting child support from Tom. This Whole time knowing he wasn't their father. The letter had DNA test results tucked inside, proving everything. Tom just sat there holding the papers, not saying anything. I asked if he was okay, and he said, I don't know what I am anymore. The kids came home an hour later asking about dinner. Like nothing had changed that night. Tom couldn't sleep. He kept saying, they're not mine. I've been raising someone else's kids.

My brother's boss disagreed. I walk into the restaurant holding my eight year old daughter's hand and she's never met these people. My family cut me off when I got pregnant at 17, called me a disappointment and slammed the door in my face. Eight years later, they finally agreed to meet us. My mother looks me up and down. Oh, honey, at least you tried to look nice. I'm wearing my favourite sundress, but apparently it's not enough. She hugs my daughter like she has the right. She's so well behaved despite everything. Despite everything. Like my daughter's existence is something to forcome. My sister asks if I need money for school clothes. My father won't even look at me directly. They picked this specific restaurant because it's affordable, which means they think I'm broke. My mother actually says, don't worry, sweetie, we ordered water for the table. We know being a single mom is hard. The server keeps glancing at me nervously, but I shake my head at her. My brother slides a 20 across the table for gas money home like I'm still 17, borrowing the family car. My mother asks if I ever finished high school. When I say I graduated college, she, those, oh, online degrees count too, honey. Then my brother stands up all proud. I have an announcement. I just got hired as restaurant manager at this very chain. Everyone's clapping and my mother says, See, your brother didn't ruin his life and look where he is now. My brother's bragging. I'm one of only four managers in the whole district. I report directly to regional. I'm making 60,000 a year. My father finally speaks to me. Maybe your brother can get you a job here. They're always hiring servers. My mother asks where the father of my daughter is. And I say, he left. Of course he did. What did you expect from having a baby so young? My sister shows photos from her Paris vacation last summer and tells me, maybe someday you can take your daughter somewhere nice. At one point, I managed to get out that I work in the restaurant industry. However, they keep assuming I mean waitressing. My mother tells another table very loudly, my daughter had so much potential, got pregnant at 17. We tried to help, but she wouldn't listen. My daughter asks why. Grandma seems angry. And I tell her Grandma's just confused. My brother is still going on about his promotion. The owner is supposed to stop by today, actually doing rounds at all the locations. The server is getting more nervous, hovering nearby. But I'm waiting. My family keeps talking about how hard being a single mother must be, how I probably can't afford daycare, how my daughter probably doesn't have a college fund. Such a shame, my mother says. She was so smart before she threw it all away. My daughter squeezes my Hand under the table. She knows something they don't. The manager approaches our table and my brother jumps up. This is my.

But the next day, my daughter came home from school crying, Mommy! Leah said her mom said she can't talk to me anymore. Leah was her best friend.

By Thursday, my daughter was refusing to go to school. They moved my desk away from everyone else. The teacher, Said it was for space reasons, but there's like ten feet between me and Leah now. I tried to bring her to the hairdresser to cheer her up, but when the woman saw me coming, she closed early. No apology. Just flipped the sign and pulled the blinds. My phone buzzed. It was my landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry. Rent can wait this month. This was the same man who charged me a fifty dollar inconvenience fee when I paid rent at 12:00am instead of midnight. Then the birthday party. Emily's sleepover. My daughter found out that everyone was invited except her. She was having such a bad panic attack that I had to call a hospital. Mom, what did I do? Emily is my best friend. Enough was enough. I called the school office. Something is happening to my daughter. She's being systematically excluded and I need answers right now. The counselor called back within an hour, but her voice was off, like she was choosing every word carefully. Mrs. Callahan, we just wanted to check in about your home environment. Is everything safe? If anyone new spending time around your daughter? What? What are you even asking me? I think it's best if we discuss this in person. Can you come in tomorrow morning? No. You'll tell me right now why my daughter is being tortured. Long pause. The principal will explain everything tomorrow. Beep. She hung up. Then at eleven PM, an email from my gym Membership terminated effective immediately. I've been going there for five years. The owner knew me by name. I was trying to figure out what to do when my daughter crawled into my bed at 2:00am, sobbing, Mommy, am I ugly? It took everything in me not to burst into tears. The lunch lady wouldn't look at me today. She just pointed at my tray. I finally caved. On Saturday morning, I found myself walking towards the principal's office while being escorted by a security guard. Other parents there for Saturday sports hold their kids against the walls as we passed. One mom literally shielded her son with her body, like we were dangerous. In his office, the principal locked the door behind us. The click was so loud in the silence. He walked to the windows and twisted the blinds shut. My daughter grabbed my hand tighter. Please sit down. I'll stand. What is this about? He sat at his desk, fingers hovering over his keyboard, then pulled them back. Mister Griffin, you're scaring me. Missus Callahan. He was looking at his screen, not at me.

I was 12 when my brother Adam needed a kidney. And they looked at me like I was spare parts. Adam was 17, the golden child. Captain of the basketball team, honor roll student. I was the quiet one who drew pictures and stayed in my room. When the doctors said Adam's kidneys were shutting down, my parents got tested first. Neither of them matched. Then. And they tested me. Perfect match. The nurse smiled and said I could save my brother's life. My parents didn't even ask if I wanted to do it. They scheduled the surgery that same week. I was scared, but everyone kept saying I was a hero. My mom cried and said god made me Adam's little brother for a reason. The surgery went fine for Adam. He bounced back in two weeks, back to school, back to basketball. But I had complications. My body was rejecting something. The doctor said I felt sick all the time, couldn't eat, lost 20 pounds. Adam got a welcome back party when he returned to school. Half the town showed up. My mom gave this big speech about how grateful she was that god saved her miracle baby.

One Friday night, Adam crashed his car into a tree. The er doctor told us his kidney was damaged. Not destroyed, but damaged. He might need dialysis in a few years instead of decades. My mom looked at me in the hospital waiting room and asked the question that made everything click. Would you consider donating your other kidney when he needs it? My dad nodded like this made perfect sense, like I was born to be Adam's personal organ donor. Like that was my only purpose in their lives. I stared at them for a long time. Then I asked. Asked if they'd even checked on how I was feeling after my surgery. My mom looked confused. You're fine now, she said. You recovered. I asked if they remembered that I missed my eighth grade graduation because I was too weak to walk across the stage. They didn't remember. I asked if they knew I still couldn't run without getting dizzy. They didn't know. I asked if they would have had another baby. If that baby. To give Adam kidneys, too. The silence told me everything. I Moved in with my grandma that night, packed one bag and left. My parents called once to ask when I was coming home. I told them I already was home.

My teacher asked, does anyone here know how to deliver a baby? I raised my hand as a joke. I helped my mom watch YouTube videos when she was pregnant with my brother. Does that count? The class laughed and I smiled, proud of my quick thinking. But Mister Gonzales wasn't smiling. His face had gone completely white and his hands were shaking as he gripped the edge of his desk. Good. Come with me now. The entire classroom went silent in South Dallas when a teacher used that tone. You didn't ask questions. Everyone stay in your seats. Do not leave this room. If I'm not back in 20 minutes, have someone call 9, 1 1. He was already pulling me toward the door and that's when I noticed the dark stain on his sleeve. It looked wet. It looked like blood. Mr Gonzales, what? What's happening? Is someone hurt? I tried to pull my arm free, but his grip was iron tight. I don't think I'm qualified for whatever. You're the only one who raised their hand. He cut me off. That makes you qualified. Outside, his car was already running with the doors open. She said she had until Thursday. He kept muttering while speeding out of the school parking lot. The midwife isn't answering her phone. I gripped the door handle, calculating if I could jump out at the next red light. Mister Gonzales, you're scaring me. I call my mom. No, he Swerved around a car and I slammed into the window. No one can know. Put your phone away. Turn it off. I'm not turning off my phone, I shouted, but I did anyway. We were going 50 in a 25 zone and Mr Gonzalez kept checking his mirrors like someone was following us. Finally, he pulled into a driveway of a small yellow house that definitely wasn't his. Listen to me. He grabbed my shoulders before we got out. They can't know she was here. Do you understand? No matter what happens, they can't know. I don't understand anything. I was practically yelling, now I'm 17. I don't even have my license yet. Marco. He used my name for the first time, his voice desperate. You've kept bigger secrets than this. I know your family. I need that same silence now. He wasn't wrong. I'd already seen two drive bys this year and never said a word to the cops. But this felt different. He shoved a pair of surgical gloves into my hands. Put these on. The front door was unlocked. Inside, we followed the sound of crying to a back bedroom where a woman was curled up on a bare mattress. She looked young, maybe early 20s, with long black hair stuck to her face with sweat. It's too early, she gasped in accented English when she saw us. Then she looked at me and started crying harder. He's just a child. You brought a child. I'm 17. I said, stupid, like that made any difference. I watch Grey's anatomy, if that helps. She switched to Spanish and started begging Mister Gonzales for something I couldn't understand. He pushed me toward her. Check how dilated she is. What? I backed up so fast I knocked over.

So I made sure he saw exactly how much I didn't need him. Uncle Wayne was worth millions but lived like a miser, constantly testing our family to see who was worthy of his money. Every holiday was an audition where cousins would compete for his approval like desperate contestants on a reality show. I'm leaving everything to whoever proves they don't need it, announce at family dinners while everyone kissed his ass and hung on his every word. My cousins would bring him expensive gifts they couldn't afford, offer to clean his house for free, practically beg for his attention and validation. They'd research his interests and pretend to share his hobbies. My cousin Kyle even switched his major to business because Uncle Wayne mentioned he respected entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, I brought nothing and sat in the corner reading a book, completely disinterested in his little power games. Grace doesn't seem to care about family, he'd say loud enough for me to hear. Testing to see if I'd scramble for his approval like the others. You're right, I'd reply without looking up from my book. I don't care about your money either. This always made him pause. While my cousins were falling over themselves to prove their worth, I was actively proving my indifference. While they fought over who could drive him to appointments and grocery shop for him, I got a second job and started Saving every penny. While they argued about his will, I was building my own future. When they'd ask why I never visited Uncle Wayne, I'd say, he has plenty of volunteers. I found his manipulation disgusting. Watching grown adults debase themselves for money made me sick. I'd rather be broke with dignity than rich through desperation. My cousins thought I was crazy. Don't you want financial security? Anna would ask. I'm setting myself up without begging, I tell her. While they spent their weekends doing his yard work and running his errands, I was working overtime and taking online courses to improve my skills. While they were buying him birthday presents and Christmas gifts, I was investing in my education and building an emergency fund. Dynamic was fascinating to watch. The more desperate they became for his approval, the more he seemed to enjoy withholding it. The more I ignored him, the more curious he became about me. At family gatherings, he'd try to bait me into conversations about money and success. I'd give polite, brief responses and go back to whatever I was doing. I wasn't rude, but I wasn't performing for him either. Grace, what are your career plans? He'd ask in front of everyone. Working on it, I'd say, simply not elaborating. This drove him crazy because he couldn't figure out my angle. Everyone else was transparent in their attempts to impress him, but I genuinely didn't seem to care about his opinion or his money. The.

Everyone told me that I put down a girl and that's wrong, but I don't care. I do it a million times if I had to. By 6th grade, I grew taller than everyone else, which was cool, but I was a bit overweight, which never helped. By 7th, I stood a foot over most girls and weighed more, too. I got loud when I was nervous. A girl named Kira liked that. She had shiny hair, a clean hoodie and a laugh that pulled people in. It's started in the cafeteria. I sat with two girls from band trying to eat slow. Kira slid by my table and tapped the corner of my mouth like I had crumbs. I wiped, found nothing. Then Jim. We ran laps while the teacher clicked a stopwatch. My legs burned. Kira paced me for one lap and leaned close. She whispered, eat less, then sprinted ahead like she'd broken a record. By winter, the group chat made it worse. Someone posted a picture of my back on the bus. The caption said, thickzilla takes homeroom. I muted my phone and shoved it into my bag. I knew more about Kira than she thought. In 6th grade, a girl from her street whispered a story. Police cars outside her house one night. Her dad dead, her mom arrested. I didn't trust it until I searched on my school Chromebook. A short article appeared with her Street name and a line about a family fight reading it felt like holding a secret I didn't want I closed the tab and told no one. I even tried to be kinder. I held doors for her said hi in the hall told myself her jokes came from pain if I stayed calm, maybe she'd get bored she didn't. She watched my plate at lunch and shook her head she filmed my mile time and posted it she called me big show when I walked past her friends Spirit week she told the cheer girls I stretched out the Pep rally shirt on the bus when we hit a pothole and I grabbed the rail she laughed and said the bus didn't stand a chance. In health class she asked if stretch marks meant someone let themselves go and a few kids glanced at me before looking away. I Learned to breathe through it. In my room, I jogged in place with the fan on thighs rubbing out a low sound. I saved that page like a scar the the day it broke started like any Tuesday. The gym smelled like body spray and old rubber. We'd run the mile outside and came in to change. Lockers clanked sneakers grape I peeled my shirt off silver stretch marks flashing across my hips and thighs from growing too fast I dug through my bag too long for my clean tea. Kira stood at the end of the bench with a Bottle of shimmer spray, she pointed at my skin. Her voice carried. Wow, look at those stretch marks. Maybe save some lunch money for lotion. Heads turned. A water bottle rolled off a bench and bumped the tile. Two cheer girls stifled laughs. The girl from math stared at the floor. Someone whispered, stop, but it was weak. My eyes stung. Heat climbed my neck. Then the fan in my head went quiet. For two years, I'd carried her secret like glass. I'd taken the stairs, the jokes, the photos. I'd given her chances to.

I had to choose. I'm at work on a Tuesday morning when my wife texts, having contractions. Think this is it. Meet you at Memorial Hospital. I'm grabbing my car keys when my phone rings. It's my twin sister, and she's sobbing. My water just broke. I'm scared. I'm headed to Valencia Hospital. Please come. I freeze in the parking lot, holding the phone up to my ear. My wife is 39 weeks pregnant with our first baby. My sister is only 34 weeks, making this a high risk pregnancy. And her boyfriend left her two months ago after they found out the baby has down syndrome. The hospitals are 45 minutes apart in opposite directions. I stand there like an idiot while the two most important women in my life need me in two different places. I drive toward my sister first because she's alone and high risk. I call my wife from the car. When I tell her, she's crying, but says she understands. My sister texts, contractions getting stronger. Nurse says I'm 4 centimeters dilated. I think back to when my sister held my hand through our dad's death when we were 16. She's been there through my depression, my divorce from my first marriage, everything. She chose me as her birth partner months ago when her boyfriend bailed. My wife texts, contractions five minutes apart now. Then I'm scared, too. Then we promised We'd do this together. My wife has an anxiety disorder and she's been planning this birth for three years. The playlist, wrote letters to the baby. We practice breathing exercises every night. I'm driving when my breathing starts coming in faster and my hands are shaking so bad I swerve into the other lane. A truck horn blares and I yank the wheel back, nearly going off the road. I have to pull over on the highway shoulder just so I can gasp for air. Full panic attack. Head and hands on the steering wheel trying to breathe. My phone explodes with calls. I answer them one by one. My mother in law is screaming, we just got to the hospital. Where are you? How dare you leave her right now? My father in law texts, get back here now. Man up and support your family. Then my mom calls, we're getting on a plane, but that's five hours away. You need to step up as her big brother. Your sister has nobody. The baby might not survive. My dad texts, blood comes first. Your wife has family. Your sister has no one. I sit there for a moment longer, breathing. Then I call both hospitals. My sister's nurse says she's asking for you. She's terrified. My wife's nurse told me she's progressing fast. Where are you? My phone's at 5% battery from all the calls. At this point, the last thing I hear is my mother in law saying If you're not here when that baby comes, don't bother coming home. My phone dies right there in my hands, still vibrating. With another call coming in. I choose to go to my sister because she's alone and at higher risk. I speed toward her hospital, crying the whole way.

When I moved from Beijing to northwest England, I quickly realised that the people weren't exactly welcoming to an Asian student. On my first day, I wanted to make some friends, so I walked up to a group of girls sitting near the windows and asked if I could join them for lunch. The blonde one literally recoiled from me and loudly went, Ew, while the others burst out laughing. One of them started doing that stupid pulling your eyes back thing while saying, go back to China in but she thought was a Chinese accent. I kept my expression neutral and then walked away with as much dignity as I could manage while they kept laughing behind me. A week later, I finally made friends with some theater kids who actually treated me like a human being. My new friends were excited to try the dumplings I brought for lunch, and for the first time since arriving, I felt like maybe things would be okay. Then that same blonde girl walked past carrying her water bottle. She tripped and dumped the entire thing over our table. Water soaked through everything, including the container of dumplings I brought. My friend sat frozen while she said, oops, my bad, I'm just cleaning the table and walked off laughing. When I tried complaining to the counselor, he gave me a patronising smile saying, girls, Will be girls. Maybe I should try harder to understand the culture. I wanted to scream that getting water poured on my food had nothing to do with culture. My breaking point came a few days later when I was walking home after school. I saw the group of five girls, including the blonde one, standing on the sidewalk and my stomach dropped. They spotted me immediately and before I could cross the street, they rushed over and surrounded me. My heart was racing and I could feel panic rising in my throat. But I tried to stay calm and said firmly, move out of my way. But they just laughed harder. The blonde one said something to the others and they all reached into their bags. At the same time, they pulled out their water bottles and I realized what was about to happen, but there was nowhere to go. They unscrewed the caps in unison like they were first it and then they all poured everything on me at once. The water was freezing cold and there was so much of it that I literally started shivering. As they walked away laughing, the blonde one called me the c word, slur, and they all thought that was hilarious. I'd never felt so humiliated and angry at the same time. Something inside me just broke. When I got home, I told my mum I've been caught in the rain because I couldn't bear to see her face if she Knew the truth. The next morning, I marched into the counselor's office and told him everything that had happened. He listened to the whole story, then shrugged and said since it happened off school grounds, there was nothing they could do about it. That was when I knew I had to handle this myself. I left his office and went straight to the engineering department where I knew they kept supplies for building theater sets. I found a bottle of brown acrylic paint and poured it into an empty water bottle. Then I waited. The next day after P E, I spotted the blonde girl walking back to the main holding by herself. Her hair was perfectly styled, even though she just been sweating in gym class, which seemed to be her superpower. She was checking her phone and walking slowly, which gave me the perfect opportunity. I followed her, keeping just enough distance that she wouldn't notice my heart was pounding and my hands were shaking, but I kept going. When I got close enough, I pulled out my water bottle, uncapped it, raised it over her head and poured the entire contents over her pristine blonde hair. The paint was thick and dark brown and it immediately soaked into every strand. She was just startled at.

I was six beers deep at the hotel bar when Alan put $300 on the counter. Bet you can't give a toast at that wedding next door. We could hear the DJ through the wall asking for speakers. My girlfriend had just dumped me over text for never taking risks or putting myself out there. I've been telling my friends all night that I could charm anyone, and Alan decided to test me. The guys all leaned in to see if I'd take the bet. The reception was at that point where they open the mic to anyone who wants to speak. My drunk plan was simple. I pretend to work with the groom and give a generic business guy speech. Rob told me dedication and commitment were perfect wedding words. The ballroom doors were open and people were walking freely between spaces. My shirt was wrinkled, but the lights were dim enough to hide it. I walked in from the hotel bar, and when the DJ saw me approaching the microphone, he looked relieved that someone finally volunteered. I grabbed the microphone and a champagne glass from a passing waiter and told everyone I needed a moment outside because big moments get to me. While people smiled and nodded and the bride sat up to listen, I started with safe stuff about knowing the groom from work and watching him grow as a professional before pointing at the bride and saying, this guy talks. About you, the way he talks about his biggest wins. Everyone laughed while the groom mouth thank you from his table with tears forming in his eyes. I kept going with generic lines about late nights at the office paying off. Remember those long nights when everything seemed impossible? I said, getting nods from everyone who'd ever worked late. Well, now you found someone worth losing sleep for. My voice cracked when I mentioned what makes a good partnership because that's what my ex said I couldn't do, but I pushed through and finished by saying they deserved all the happiness in the world. The room exploded with applause and the groom caught me in a huge hug saying it meant everything. Probably too emotional and drunk to wonder why he didn't remember me. And that's when Natalie walked up with dark hair and a smile that made me forget why I was there. She pressed a napkin with her purple penned number into my hand while saying I work for the wedding planner and I've never heard such a beautiful toast from a business guy. And we ended up dancing for a few songs while my friends watched from the doorway in shock. During our last dance, Natalie asked coffee sometime? Right in my ear and I said yes immediately. When my friends texted that the hotel bar was closing, she squeezed my hand, making me promise to call before I left, feeling better than I had in weeks. Two weeks later, the bride tried to send me a thank you card, but couldn't figure out who I was. The wedding planner pulled security footage and saw me walking in from the public bar and grabbing a glass from their reception waiter. The hotel banned me using my credit card information from the bar tab. That night, Natalie texted the planner

The landlord started laughing. My roommate's boyfriend, Wesley, had been planning this moment for months, ever since he started staying over back in June. He'd been telling his boys about how he was finessing his way into a free apartment. He even started forwarding his mail here to establish what he called residency rights. The relationship wasn't even official before Wesley started making his move. He'd walk around my apartment, well, what he thought was going to be his apartment, measuring rooms and telling his cousin which wall would be perfect for his TV setup. Melanie's been carrying this dead weight for too long, he'd mutter while eating my groceries. Time for her to learn she doesn't need a roommate anymore. So there I was, standing in my own living room on a Thursday night. The whole place smelled like the Cologne Wesley bathed in. Wesley showed up with his cousin Mitchell and two duffel bags, already acting like he owned the place, both of them looking like they were ready to physically move me out if needed. Melanie, I hope you found somewhere else to stay, Wesley said, dropping his bags by the door. This is happening tonight. You've been taking advantage of my girl's kindness for long enough. I stayed quiet, scrolling through my phone, let him have his moment. Melanie sat on the couch, avoiding eye contact with everyone. Wesley had been working on her for weeks. Convincing her that I was holding her back, that they needed their privacy, that couples shouldn't have roommates. She'd started parroting his words recently. Maybe it's time for a change. Maybe we've outgrown this arrangement. Classic Wesley manipulation. The man didn't even have his own place. He been couch surfing. Before he latched onto Melanie, Wesley pulled out a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket. I printed out this 30 day notice. But honestly, you should just go tonight. Make this easy on everyone. Mitchell nodded like this was all perfectly legal. Smart move, Wesley. She's had a free ride long enough. I looked at the paper and almost laughed. He downloaded some random eviction template and just wrote my name on it in pen. Melanie finally spoke up, her voice barely a whisper. Maybe we can give her the weekend at least. Wesley shot her a look that made her shut up immediately. Nah, baby, we discuss this. She goes tonight. That's when I made the call. Hey, Mister Sanders, I said, putting him on speaker. Could you come up to 2C? We have a situation here. Wesley's chest puffed out. Good. Call the landlord. I'm taking over this lease. Anyway, Melanie and I are common law now. Five minutes later, Mister Sanders walked in with his master keys jingling. He was this 60 year old Brooklyn native who'd owned the building for 30 years. He took one look at the scene. Wesley with his bags, Mitchell trying To look intimidating, Melanie shrinking into the couch and me standing there calm as could be. What's going on here? Mr. Sanders asked, though his slight smirk told me he already knew. Wesley stepped forward with all the confidence of someone who'd watched too many law shows. I'm moving in and she's moving out. I've been living here for three months, which makes me a tenant. Melanie and I are together, so I'm taking over her half of the lease. Mr. Sanders looked at Wesley like he'd just said the earth was flat. Then he started laughing. Not a chuckle, but a full belly laugh that went on for a solid thirty seconds. Wesley's face. He started twitching. What's so funny, old man? Mr. Sanders wiped his eyes and pulled out his phone. Let me show you something, son. He pulled up a document. This is the lease for apartment two C.

Uncle Wayne was worth millions, but lived like a miser, constantly testing our family to see who was worthy of his money. Every holiday was an audition where cousins would compete for his approval like desperate contestants on a reality show. I'm leaving everything to whoever proves they don't need it. Announce at family dinners while everyone kissed his ass and hung on his every word. My cousins would bring him expensive gifts they couldn't afford, offer to clean his house for free, practically beg for his attention and validation. They'd research his interests and pretend to share his hobbies. My cousin Kyle even switched his major to business because Uncle Wayne mentioned he respected entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, I brought nothing and sat in the corner reading a book, completely disinterested in his little power games. Grace doesn't seem to care about family, he'd say loud enough for me to hear. Testing to see if I'd scramble for his approval like the others. You're right, I'd reply without looking up from my book. I don't care about your money, either. This always made him pause. While my cousins were falling over themselves to prove their worth, I was actively proving my indifference. While they fought over who could drive him to appointments and grocery shop for him, I got a second job and started Saving every penny. While they argued about his will, I was building my own future. When they'd ask why I never visited Uncle Wayne, I'd say, he has plenty of volunteers. I found his manipulation disgusting. Watching grown adults to base themselves for money made me sick. I'd rather be broke with dignity than rich through desperation. My cousins thought I was crazy. Don't you want financial security? Anna would ask. I'm setting myself up without begging. Tell her. While they spent their weekends doing his yard work and running his errands, I was working overtime and taking online courses to improve my skills. While they were buying him birthday presents and Christmas gifts, I was investing in my education and building an emergency fund. Dynamic was fascinating to watch. The more desperate they became for his approval, the more he seemed to enjoy withholding it. The more I ignored him, the more curious he became about me. At family gatherings, he'd try to bait me into conversations about money and success. I'd give polite, brief responses and go back to whatever I was doing. I wasn't rude, but I wasn't performing for him either. Grace, what are your career plans? He'd ask in front of everyone. Working on it, I'd say. Simply not elaborating. This drove him crazy because he couldn't figure out my angle. Everyone else was transparent in their attempts to impress him, but I genuinely didn't seem to care about his opinion or his money. The The day he died, everyone gathered for the will reading like vultures circling fresh prey. My cousins had been speculating for years about who would inherit what. They'd made alliances and enemies within the family based on their perceived chances. The lawyer cleared his throat and began reading. Mr. Wayne has left his entire estate, valued at $3.2 million, to his niece Grace, with a note that reads, she was the only one who never asked me for anything because she was too busy building something for herself. The silence in that room was deafening.

The compensation was $800 plus a hotel voucher. This businessman in an expensive suit storms over and taps my shoulder. Hey, you should volunteer. I have a million dollar deal closing tomorrow. I politely told him I had an important interview and couldn't give up my seat. His face turned red. Do you know who I am? I fly first class every week. You look like you could use that $800 more than I need this hassle. I said no again and put my headphones back on. But he wouldn't let it go. He sits down right next to me. Listen, I'm trying to be nice here. That interview can be rescheduled. My deal can't. I told him he didn't know anything about my situation and asked him to leave me alone. He laughs and pulls out his phone. What company? I probably know the CEO. I. I can make one call and get you a better position. I ignored him completely and moved to a different seat across the gate area. He actually follows me and sits down again. You're making this harder than it needs to be. I'm offering to help you out here. Other passengers started noticing this guy literally following me around the gate area, starts talking loudly to anyone who listen. Can you believe this? I offered to compensate him personally. And he's being completely unreasonable. A woman with kids nearby asked him to keep it down because he was being, he turns to her and says, ma'am, I'm trying to solve a problem here. Then he goes back to the gate agent and I hear him say, that guy over there refuses to volunteer. Can't you just bump him instead? The gate agent explains that's not how it works and they need actual volunteer. He storms back over to me with this entitled smirk, fine. The gate agent suggested I negotiate directly with passengers. I told him the gate agent definitely didn't say that and he was lying. His voice gets even louder. I've been flying for 20 years and I've never met someone so stubborn. Now half the gate is watching this spectacle he's creating. He pulls out his business card and waves it around. I'm a senior partner at Donaldson and Associates. Look it up. Nobody cared about his business card, but he kept waving it anyway. Then he starts approaching other passengers, asking if they'll volunteer and pointing at me saying, he won't do it, so maybe you will. This college kid tells him, dude, leave him alone. You volunteer if it's so important. Snapped back, I'm in first class. They can't bump me. It has to be someone from economy. The college kid laughs and says, then deal with it like everyone else. He's getting more aggressive now, pacing around the gate area and complaining loudly. To anyone who'll make eye contact. Then he pulls out his wallet. Fine, I'll give you 1,000 cash right now. Just take the voucher, I told him.

She always had an excuse, always managed to twist things so it seemed like someone else's fault. And little by little, I watched Jason fade. We tried everything, therapy, discipline, extra attention, less attention, family meetings, reward charts, stricter rules, softer approaches. Nothing stuck. Olivia always stayed one Step ahead. To outsiders, she was the sweet, funny girl. At home, she could be cruel when no one was looking. Then came the day everything cracked open. She told us Jason had been touching her inappropriately.

On my first day, I wanted to make some friends, so I walked up to a group of girls sitting near the windows and asked if I could join them for lunch. The blonde one literally recoiled from me and loudly went Ew! While the others burst out laughing. One of them started doing that stupid pulling your eyes back thing while saying go back to China in what she thought was a Chinese accent. I kept my expression neutral and then walked away with as much dignity as I could manage while they kept laughing behind me. A week later, I finally made friends with some theater kids who actually treated me like a human being. My new friends were excited to try the dumplings I brought for lunch, and for the first time since arriving, I felt like maybe things would be okay. Then that same blonde girl walked past carrying her water bottle. She tripped and dumped the entire thing over our table. Water soaked through everything, including the container of dumplings I brought. My friend sat frozen while she said oops, my bad, I'm just clean in the table and walked off laughing. When I tried complaining to the counselor, he gave me a patronizing smile, saying girls will be girls and maybe I should try harder to understand the culture. I wanted to scream That getting water poured on my food had nothing to do with culture. My breaking point came a few days later when I was walking home after school. I saw the group of five girls, including the blonde one, standing on the sidewalk, and my stomach dropped. They spotted me immediately, and before I could cross the street, they rushed over and surrounded me completely. My heart was racing and I could feel panic rising in my throat. But I tried to stay calm and said firmly, move out of my way, but they just laughed harder. The blonde one said something to the others, and they all reached into their bags at the same time. They pulled out their water bottles, and I realized what was about to happen. But there was nowhere to go. They unscrewed the caps in unison like they've heard, and then they all poured everything on me at once. The water was freezing cold, and there was so much of it that I literally started shivering. As they walked away laughing, the blonde one called me the C word slur, and they all thought that was hilarious. I never felt so humiliated and angry at the same time. Something inside me just broke. When I got home, I told my mum I'd been caught in the rain because I couldn't bear to see her face if she I knew the truth. The next morning, I marched into the counselor's office and told him everything. That had happened. He listened to the whole story, then shrugged and said since it happened off school grounds, there was nothing they could do about it. That was when I knew I had to handle this myself. I left his office and went straight to the engineering department, where I knew they kept supplies for building theater sets. I found a bottle of brown acrylic paint and poured it into an empty water bottle. Then I waited. The next day after P E, I spotted the blonde girl walking back to the main building by herself. Her hair was perfectly styled, even though she'd just been sweating in gym class, with seemed to be her superpower. She was checking her phone and walking slowly, which gave me the perfect opportunity. I followed her, keeping just enough distance that she wouldn't notice. My heart was pounding and my hands were shaking, but I kept going. When I got close enough, I pulled out my water bottle, uncapped it, raised it over her head, and poured the entire contents over her pristine blonde hair. The paint was thick and dark brown, and it immediately soaked into every strand. She was just startled at

My school had this completely insane bathroom rule where you could only use the restroom twice per day. Two times. That was it. They gave each teacher a clipboard with our names on it and they had to check us off every single time we asked to go. The whole thing started because some kids were apparently vaping in the bathrooms. So instead of dealing with those specific kids, the administration decided to punish everyone. They hired Mrs. Wilson as the bathroom monitor, and she took her job way too seriously. This woman would literally stand outside the bathrooms timing how long we were in there. By November, half the school was walking around looking like they were about to explode. My friend Connor actually wet himself during third period math because he already used his two bathroom passes for the day. The teacher just ignored him and kept teaching while this poor kid sat there humiliated. That's when Emma had enough. She was this quiet girl who never caused trouble, but she was also the smartest kid in our grade. During lunch, she pulled out the student handbook and started reading through all the bathroom policies. He found something interesting on page 47. The rules said students were limited to two bathroom visits per day, but it didn't say anything about how long each visit could be. Emma realized we could technically stay in there for hours as Long as we only went twice, Emma started spreading the word. She told us to bring books next, whatever we needed. The plan was simple, make each bathroom visit count. So we did exactly that. The next Monday, I grabbed a sandwich and my history textbook before asking for my first bathroom pass. I stayed in there for 45 minutes, studying for my quiz next period. When I came back, my teacher looked annoyed.

Tasha and Max have been fighting over their seven year old daughter, Lila for almost a year. Max kept saying Tasha's new boyfriend was a bad influence, while Tasha claimed Max let Lila eat nothing but chicken nuggets and fall asleep watching scary movies every night. The judge decided to bring Lila into his chambers to ask what she liked about staying with each parent. Nothing too serious, just basic questions to understand her routine. Lila bounced into the room wearing a bright pink dress with unicorns on it, swinging her legs from the big chair and grinning at everyone. The judge smiled and asked her, do you have fun when you stay with your daddy? Lila nodded enthusiastically, oh yes! Daddy lets me wear makeup to the stripper place. The entire room went dead silent. Max turned bright red and his lawyer actually choked on his coffee. Tasha's mouth dropped open and her attorney started scribbling notes furiously. The judge's eyebrows shot up so high they almost hit his hairline. The what place? Judge asked very carefully. The stripper place. Lila chirped happily, completely oblivious to the chaos she just caused. It has really loud music and colourful lights, and they give us popcorn and cotton candy. The ladies wear super pretty costumes like tigers and butterflies, and they climb up really high and dance around these big poles. Max was frantically mouthing, it's not what it Sounds like to his lawyer. While making choking gestures, Tasha looked like Christmas morning had arrived early. The judge leaned forward and asked Lila to tell him more about this place. She was thrilled to explain, well, we eat snacks and watch the ladies practice their flips and twirls. Then I get to try it, too. They put this harness thing on me, and I spin around like a princess. Daddy says the place is called pole and play and it's where strong ladies exercise.

Yeah, like an hour ago. Why? He dropped to his knees right there on the kitchen floor. For a second, I thought he was joking, but then he started dry heaving into the sink. She ate it. The whole thing. His voice cracked. He ran out to the bathroom, slamming the door. That's when Delilah burst through the front door, still in her dental hygiene scrubs. She must have left work early. Where's Killian? She asked, breathless. He texted to call 9 1 1 and something about you eating the last slice. Delilah pounded on the bathroom door. Killian, baby, what's wrong? He came out, eyes red, and showed her something. Delilah's face went from worried to devastated in seconds. Now. Oh, she whispered. No, no, no. My phone buzzed. It was our landlord. Heard what happened. So sorry. Rent can wait this month. My stomach cramped suddenly, sharp enough to double me over the chocolate cake. Another wave of nausea hit, and I barely made it to the kitchen kitchen sink. My roommate Damien rubbed my back, which was so out of character, I'd have laughed if I wasn't puking. She's been waiting two years to eat that cake, Killian muttered, looking at Delilah, who was now sitting on the floor, crying her eyes out. Two years for what? I gasped between heaves. Nobody answered. My phone rang. It was my mom. Hey, I'm So disappointed in you. How could you do this? She hung up before I could ask what she was talking about. We need to go to the hospital, Killian said. Now. What? Why? It's just food poisoning. Delilah stood up, her face pale. It's not food poisoning. Please, just trust me. We need to go now. Killian was already grabbing his keys. The cramping was getting worse. In the car, Delilah wouldn't even look at me. Killian kept checking his phone and wincing at whatever he saw. What was in that cake? I asked again, starting to panic. The pain was spreading. Delilah finally spoke, her voice hollow. My future just. We'll deal with it at the hospital, Killian said. At the ER, Killian ran ahead to talk to the intake nurse. I couldn't hear what he was saying, but she looked shocked and waved us through immediately. That's when I knew something was really, really wrong. Delilah looked like she might cry or scream or both. A doctor appeared with a portable X ray machine. We need to check your stomach contents immediately. For food poisoning? He exchanged a look with Killian and Delilah. Not exactly. Let's just see what we find. A nurse started prepping an IV. Any allergy Jeez I should know about? She asked. Medications? Latex. She paused, looking at her clipboard. Reactions to platinum or white? Gold. No, I answered, completely confused. They made everyone leave the room while they X rayed my abdomen. The Doctor studied the image on his tablet, zooming in on something. Killian's mom appeared in the doorway. She looked at me like I'd killed her dog. Is it still intact? She asked the doctor. It's been in my family for 90 years. The room went silent except for the beeping machines. Delilah finally looked at me, her face a mask of controlled rage. There's definitely a metallic object in your stomach, he whispered. I stared at him. A what? Delilah's face went red with anger. You ate my engagement ring. I what? Killian cleared his throat. I hid Grandma's ring in your favorite cake. I was going to propose. That was my cake from my boyfriend for our anniversary. It was on the middle shelf. The words tumbled out as my brain tried to catch up. That's the communal shelf. Everyone knows that. I was saving it for tonight. Delilah's voice rose. You. You literally have your own shelf. Your name is on it in purple Sharpie. My stomach gurgled again. The ring was in there, supposedly worth thousands of dollars. Floating around with a chocolate cake I thought was communal property. The doctor handed me a bottle of thick white liquid. This should speed things along. You'll need to and everything to recover the ring. Delilah started crying. Killian was still listing everything he had planned. His mom was facetiming with angry relatives. My roommate texted me. This is why I label everything, even my water bottles now. Next. Time, I told Killian as another cramp hit. Maybe just use a ring box like a normal person. There won't be a next time. Delilah screamed. The doctor cleared his throat. Well, this is certainly going to be an insurance nightmare, destroying property worth thousands. You're a thief! Killian's mom's fat. Delilah wiped her tears. Your type always takes what isn't theirs. As I sat there with the laxatives, I remembered something. Something that would make them regret how they treated me. I reached for my phone in my pocket and pulled out the photo gallery, scrolling back to yesterday afternoon. There it was, the chocolate cake, sitting right on the middle shelf of our fridge, with my handwritten note taped to the white bakery box that said Happy Anniversary, Brandon. Love me in blue pen. I turned the screen toward them and watch their faces change. Killian went white first, then his mom, then Delilah, who grabbed the phone from my hand to look closer. The time stamp showed three forty seven PM yesterday, clear as day. Killian started opening and close, closing his mouth like a fish, trying to find words that wouldn't come out. He finally managed to stammer about how Delilah had mentioned wanting chocolate cake last week and he just assumed when he saw it. His mom snatched my phone from Delilah's hands, holding it close to her face and squinting

My 12 year old daughter Adeline takes the bus home from school every day. She's always been chatty about her day. But last week something changed. She started mentioning this nice man who always sits behind her and asks about her homework, her friends, what she likes to do after school. Red flags everywhere. At first I thought maybe she was just being friendly. But then Adeline said he'd complimented her hair and asked if she walked home alone from the bus stop. When she told me he knew which stop was hers, even though he never got off there, my stomach dropped. I decided to follow the bus route in my car the next afternoon. Sure enough, there's this guy in his 40s who gets on at the stop right after Adeline's school. He's not dressed like someone heading to work, no briefcase, no uniform, just sitting there in a baseball cap watching the kids. I followed the bus for three stops. He never got off, just rode it to the end of the route, then walked back to his car parked at the school. When Adeline told me he'd offered her candy and asked where exactly we lived, including what our house looks like, I knew I had to act fast. The next morning I called in sick to work and got on that bus myself, sat three rows behind him with sunglasses and a hoodie up. Adeline didn't even Notice me boarding? I watched him scan every kid getting on, but his eyes locked on Adeline the moment she stepped up those bus steps. He immediately moved to the seat directly behind her and started his routine. How was school today, sweetheart? Did you think about what I said yesterday about our little secret? Adeline looked uncomfortable but was trying to be polite. Um, I guess so. Good girl. Smart girls like you deserve special treats. Maybe we could meet up sometime when your parents aren't around. I know a place near your house where we could talk. That's when I stood up. Walk.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years, and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size, and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend, she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler, who said she was being a total bitch. I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my Fitness Pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee, With extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better, and she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

She returned 6 years later to find I'd divorced her and moved on. The note was taped to our bathroom mirror. Going to live with my sister in California. Need space to figure things out. Back in 2, 3 years, Max. Don't change the locks. He left while I was at work and the twins were at school. No goodbye, no explanation. To our eight year olds, that first night was brutal. Skyler kept asking when Mommy was coming home, and Walter just stared at his untouched dinner. I had no idea how to explain that their mother had essentially abandoned them for a midlife crisis. But something weird happened after the initial shock wore off. Our house became peaceful. No more constant arguing about money. No more her undermining my parenting decisions. No more walking on eggshells around her mood swings. Year one was learning mode. I figured out how to braid Skyler's hair after watching YouTube tutorials for hours. I taught Walter to throw a curveball in our backyard. We established routines that actually worked. Homework at the kitchen table, then dinner together every night. Year two brought unexpected changes. Without the stress of a failing marriage. I got promoted at work. The kids grades improved dramatically. We started family game nights and camping trips. I realized I'd been so focused on fixing my marriage that I'd forgotten how to Enjoy my children. Year 3 changed everything. At Walter's baseball game, I met Eleanor, another single parent. She was a third grade teacher, patient and kind. When Skyler spilled juice all over herself, Eleanor calmly helped clean her up without making a big deal about it. That small moment showed me what partnership could actually look like. Eleanor and I took things incredibly slow. The kids had been through enough upheaval. But gradually, she became part of our routine. She helped with homework, taught Skyler to bake cookies, and never once tried to replace their mother. Just added love to our family. Year 4, Eleanor moved in. The transition was seamless because the kids genuinely adored her. They started calling her bonus mom. Their own idea. She attended every school event, packed their lunches with little encouraging notes, and tucked them in at night. Year five was magical. Eleanor and I got married in our backyard. Skyler and Walter insisted on walking her down the aisle together. In their speeches, they thanked her for making dad smile again and. And being the mom who stayed, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. By year six, our life had completely transformed. We bought a bigger house with a proper yard. The kids were thriving. Skyler made honor roll. Walter was team captain. Eleanor had legally adopted them after my ex's parental rights were terminated for abandonment. We were a real family. The legal process had been surprisingly straightforward. After three Years of zero contact. Court classified it as voluntary abandonment. Eleanor's adoption paperwork went through without a hitch. The kids were ecstatic to officially change their last names to match ours. Last Tuesday, everything changed again. I was making coffee when I heard Eleanor gasp from the living room. Through the window, we watched my ex climbing out of a U Haul truck pulling suitcases toward our front door. She still had our old house key. She walked straight into our kitchen like she owned the place.

She could pack an entire house in 48 hours, make friends at every new base within a week, and somehow kept three kids fed, clothed and in school through 8 different moves. She ran every FRG meeting while dad was deployed, organized care packages for the whole unit and never missed sending him his favorite beef jerky. Even when money was tight, she was the one other spouses called at 3:00am when they couldn't handle another night alone. Dad was coming up on his 20 years and mom had been planning for this moment since deployment No. 3. She'd saved every penny she could, researched real estate in Colorado where her sister lived, even picked out the exact house she wanted with the wrap around porch. Just one more year, she kept saying, then we can finally plant roots for a real home. The kids can finish high school in one place. The reenlistment ceremony was supposed to be next Tuesday. Mom thought it was Dad's retirement ceremony. She'd invited her whole family from Colorado, bought a new dress. Hell, she even made a photo album of all our moves titled The Journey to home. I helped her glue every picture. There was one of her crying in the driveway of our first base housing, pregnant with me. Another of her painting my sister's room for the fourth time in a different house. He written little notes under each one, things Like move No. 3 left behind the garden I planted and move No. 6, Tommy's best friend stayed here. But here's the thing, nobody knew dad had already re enlisted three months ago, signed another six years without saying poop. And that wasn't even the worst part. Mom found out at the FRG Christmas party. We were all there. The whole battalion family thing, kids running around with cookies, some Colonel's wife talking about resilience or whatever. Mom was helping serve punch when she overheard two lieutenant's wives gossiping by the dessert table. Did you see Major Wilson with Captain Brooks at the P X yesterday? They weren't even trying to hide it anymore. The other one laughed. 20 years his wife's been waiting and he's spending his reenlistment bonus on jewelry for another woman. Mom's hand froze on the ladle. I watched her face change real slow like watching ice form on a window. She sat down the punch walked straight across that community center and stood right in front of dad. He was laughing with some other officers by the Christmas tree. Is it true? That's all she said. Real quiet. Everyone around them stopped talking. Dad's face did this thing where he tried to look confused. Honey, what are you the re enlistment? Captain Brooks, is it true? The whole room was dead silent. Even the kids stopped running around. You could hear the shitty Christmas music playing from someone's phone. Dad straightened his uniform, looked her Right in the eye. We should discuss this at home. Mom laughed. Not a real laugh, the kind that makes your skin crawl. Twenty years, 20 years I've waited for you to come home. Really come home. Not just between deployments, not just for a weekend home. Her voice was getting louder. I've been the married single mother. I've been the mover, the, the keeper of everything while you played soldier. And you couldn't even tell me you signed away six more years of my life. Some colonel tried to step in, saying something about maintaining decorum. Mom turned on him. Decorum, decorum. Where was decorum when I was in labor with our second child and he was in a rock? Where was decorum when I had to explain to our son why daddy missed his high school graduation for a training exercise? She turned back to dad and Brooks. Really? She's 23 years old. Dad's jaw tightened. Linda, you're being hysterical. This is what military wives do. You knew what you signed up for. Maybe if you understood. Sacrifice. Sacrifice. Mom pulled out her phone, started scrolling. Let me tell you about sacrifice. I have 4,000 photos on this phone. You're in 217 of them. I know because I counted. I counted. While you were deployed. Again, she threw the phone at his chest, bounced off his medals. I sacrificed my career, my family, my friends, my sanity, my children's stability, everything. For what? So you could fuck your Co worker and sign up for more years without asking. You're embarrassing yourself, had said. Picking up her phone from the floor. And me in front of my command, mom nodded real slow. You're right. I am embarrassing myself, believing for 20 years that this would end, that I mattered as much as your precious career. She looked around the room at all the other wives. Some were crying, most were just staring. How many of you are waiting for retirement, too? How many of you think it'll be different when they hit 20? Nobody answered. Mom walked over to the dessert table, picked up the sheet cake that said Merry Christmas, 4th Battalion families in red and green frosting, walked back to dad and dumped the entire thing on his dress blues. The frosting hit his medals with this wet splat sound that made Katie gasp. Behind me. Red and green icing dripped down on Dad's chest, onto his shiny shoes, while chunks of yellow cake stuck to his ribbons. The whole room just froze, 300 people watching cake slide off major David Wilson's dress blues onto the waxed floor of the Fort Carson Community Center. Colonel Miller pushed through the crowd and stopped right in front of dad, his face turning purple. He didn't even look at mom, just stared at the mess on Dad's uniform and said real quiet that dad better be in his office at 0, 600.

Ever since I was born, our house had an open door policy. If that open door policy took steroids, my dad specifically loved enforcing it and always told us that if a door was left closed, I could say goodbye to it. I always thought he was joking until I turned 5 and experienced it myself. I was in the room with my dolls with a closed door, when suddenly it slammed open. Next thing I knew, dad had his tools out and was taking the door clean off its hinges. He then went out into the back and burned it. Still had my bunny stickers on it, but he didn't care how hard I cried. On top of that, by dinner, not only the door, but the dolls I bought with my own money were burned, too. I cried to my mom, but all she could say was that dad had anxiety about hidden dangers, so it was best to just let him feel safe. Thing is, this only got worse as I got older. When I got my first period, I desperately wanted some privacy, but the curtain my dad installed wouldn't fully close. Naturally, I shut the door. That's when he barged in, claiming nothing natural needs hiding. He stood there while I changed my tampon in the shower, telling me not to be shy. I thought it couldn't get much worse. But I was wrong. After weeks of begging my mom for a sleepover, she finally agreed for my 14th birthday. My friends arrived excited, having never visited until they saw our doorless house. There were a few strange glances thrown my way, but we moved on, running straight to my room, giggling with excitement. But the happiness did not last long. My dad started hourly safety patrols with his flashlight, peering into my room. He came in and examined every one of my friends, telling them to twirl to make sure they didn't have anything on him. And since I was the only one with the skirt, I had to twirl the longest. My friends were too creeped out and got their parents to pick them up the next day in school. Everyone was whispering about my doorless house and creepy dad. Their parents banned them from talking to me. I lost all my friends and became completely isolated. I remember at this time, I began truly hating my dad, and that only intensified at 16. I woke up to him pulling off my blanket. I screamed at him, and he went red before claiming he was searching under my mattress for contraband. My mom actually tried to intervene, but she was dragged out of my room. All I heard was the slap before the house went silent. The next morning, my mom had a bruise, and my door frame had a camera set up in it. I left at 17, with just a backpack to go to college. I didn't speak to either of them for full 20 years. And I should have left it like that. But one day I decided to bring my 12 year old daughter to visit. I didn't want to see dad, only mom. So I had her promise me that she'd keep my dad away from my daughter. She said yes. Well, at around 2:00am, I woke to the feeling of my daughter pressing into my chest. She was sobbing that Grandpa had been touching her hair. And that's when I saw the blanket we had put up for some privacy have been torn down. Dad had been touching my daughter the whole time we slept. I rushed out and saw him in his room sleeping, pressing the blanket against his chest. I wanted to call him on the spot, but before I had the chance to confront him, my mom appeared out of the bathroom. I could see visible signs of what must have been her attempting to stop him. She broke down and started whisper apologize

When I was 7, I was attacked by a German Shepherd. I nearly died after three surgeries. But I never told my husband grant, because his whole family raises golden retrievers and they literally have more photos with dogs than with people. On our third date, grant suggested we visit a dog park and I panicked and said, I'm allergic. When his face just dropped, I added, severely allergic. And now it's been eight years of this ridiculous lie. I carry fake Epipens filled with Vitamin Water like some kind of spy. I've left 17 birthday parties doing my whole itchy eyes performance. The worst part is our kids beg for a dog every single Christmas. And grant always tells them, you know, mom can't be around dogs. Sweetie could kill her. I'm literally going to hell. Then after about a week, I started to notice grant has been doing laundry constantly now, which is weird because this man once wore the same shirt for a week. He says he just wants to help more, but something feels really off about it. My son suddenly volunteers to take out the trash every single day and he literally sprints to the garage, then to the bins like he's training for the Olympics. He won't even let me help when the bags are heavy. Meanwhile, my daughter keeps spending time in the garage organizing dad's tools, which makes zero sense. Because this girl thinks a Philip's head is a hairstyle. But then I find these muddy paw prints by the garage door yesterday. And they're definitely not from a cat like grant claims, because what cat has paws the size of a toddler's hand? There's creepy scratching sounds from the garage at night and grant says it's probably raccoons. But since when do raccoons whimper? Then credit card Bill comes in and I see it has a 47 dollar charge from Petsmart. Grant says it's fraudulent and he'll handle it, but he never actually calls the think about it. I find a bag of dog food in Grant's trunk when I'm getting groceries. And he says it's for donations at work. But his office doesn't even have a coffee fund, let alone donation drives. This morning I wake up and there's blonde hair on my pillow. That confirms it for me. And I'm about to fake a reaction. But then my brain kicks in because if I have an allergic reaction now, grant will wonder why I didn't have one while I was literally sleeping face first in it all night. So I just vacuum it up quickly and pretend I saw nothing. Grant starts testing me at dinner, casually mentions the neighbor got a new puppy and watches my face like he's a detective. So I have to do my whole routine, scratch my arms and sniffle. But he looks suspicious. My son asks, mom, what happens if someone With allergies accidentally touches a dog but doesn't know. My heart stops and I ask why this little boy has the nerve to say just curious for science class. But I know they're studying volcanoes. My daughter leaves her phone open to Google search is about how to tell if someone is really allergic and can allergies suddenly go away, which makes my stomach drop because my 12 year old is apparently Sherlock Holmes. Now this morning grant says he found fur on our bed sheets. He shows me this chunk of long golden fur and says the window was open, must have blown in from somewhere. So I have to pretend to feel itchy and take a fake Benadryl in front of him. All the while he watches me swallow it like he's monitoring a science experiment. I even had to open my mouth and lift up my tongue. Then he says something that makes my blood freeze. Funny thing, I found your allergy medication in the bathroom. And he holds up my prescription bottle. I looked up these pills and the markings don't match Benadryl. They match vitamin C tablets. He continues and his voice is so calm it's terrifying. Also, you slept on that pillow with fur for hours with no reaction. And yesterday when you were napping, something else happened in our bed that should have sent you to the hospital. I literally can't breathe because he knows. They all know. But then he says we Need to talk in the garage, all of us right now. I follow them like I'm walking to my execute. I open the door and immediately find a golden retriever puppy jumping on me, licking my entire face, fur absolutely everywhere. And my skin doesn't react. No hives, no, no sneezing, nothing. Instead, I scream bloody murder and trip trying to run away. My daughter starts crying and grant says quietly, this dog slept in our bed yesterday on your pillow. Actually, we have a video. That's when my son whispers, three months we've had him three months. The dog brings me a tennis ball like we're best friends and nobody knows what to say.

Um, hi. Who's this? I can't tell you that, but I go to your school. We've never talked, but I've had a crush on you since middle school.

You have until July to figure out who I am. Is this an excuse to get me to talk to you for the whole year? Pretty much. Why not? I do need to let you know I already have a crush on a girl in my school, so don't get your hopes up. That's fine. Let's see what happens. Hey, you looked hot today. You were watching me. It's kind of weird. Rizz app, respond with, how could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? How could I take my eyes off of someone so perfect such as yourself? Wow, that actually made me feel good. At least give me clues about yourself. Why? So I can at least get a starting point on who you are. Fine. I am blonde. That doesn't help me. There are lots of blonde girls in our school. Be more specific. I have a birthmark on my neck, so I have to go check every blonde girl's neck. So tell me about this girl. You like her name? Is Violet. She's perfect. We have never spoken, sadly. Do you know her, violet? Oops, sorry. I do know her. Maybe when I find out who you are, you can introduce me to her. You can ask her right now and she will say yes. How can you be so sure? I'm too scared to ask her. Don't worry. She is nice. Okay. Good night, mystery girl. I'm going to get some sleep. Good night. What? I don't get a message today? Ah. Does someone miss me in your dreams? I was just surprised how my crush since middle school hadn't messaged me today. I have a question for you. Sure. Ask away. How could you have loved me for so long if we haven't spoken ever? You are handsome. The way you talk to people, you are such a kind soul, polite. You make everyone laugh. You are a gentleman. I always knew you are what I always wanted. Now I really wanna know who you are. Patience. Hey, hey, can I admit something to you? Sure. I'm not interested in Violet anymore. Really? How come? She's beautiful. So beautiful that I was too scared to even go near her. That's the issue. She's perfect in every way, but I have fallen for someone else. Someone who I do speak to, someone who understands me, someone without a name or a face, but someone who loves me. The day you find out who I am, I hope we will. Be together. Me too. Mystery Girl, can I confess something to you? Sure. What's up? I think it's time to tell you who I am. You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

So we recently got an email about you. Alright, is this like a like a game show or something? I I mean, I guess sort of. Yeah, like a dating game show. Yeah, it's a second date game show right now.

Amy wants to know why you don't wanna see her again. She said a lot of really nice things about you. She was nice. But like she was, I don't like to use the word crazy, but psycho.

I feel like that's more intense than even crazy. She didn't sound unhinged when we talked to her. Do you guys talk to her? Yeah. Yeah, we talked to her. She sent us an email about your date. And when we talked to her a little bit about it, she sounded perfectly normal to me. Said that you guys had a great time. And now you're like, it's obvious that you don't wanna see her again. I mean, it was like I went on a date with like two different people. So at one point of the day someone spilled something on her. I guess she started like freaking out about the spill. And I was like looking, I didn't see anything. Like I looked on her shirt. I looked on her like everything she was wearing like I don't see any spill. And then she's started going on like, oh, it's, it's on my shoe. You see spilled water on my shoe. And I look at her shoe and I don't see anything on her shoe. Like she's with, we're going over the top and I don't even see a spill. What? So I'm like, I'm trying to like Help her. So I'm like, do you need tissues? Do you need like a napkin? And what do you need me to do? Like I tried to be really helpful, but I'm staring at her shoes and I'm like, dude, there's nothing here. So it was just a over reaction to not spilling wine on her shoe that it was way more than an over reaction. And it got to the point where I had to take her away from the group and like calm her down because she was like flipping out about this imaginary thing. Was she about ready to like crack open a wine glass and cut somebody with it? I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if she.

No, all you do is talk and all I do is listen. I'm done, mom. I want you to hear me. Please, Mommy, hear me. I'm listening, Beth. I am listening. I hate myself. I feel like I'll always be nothing. You've made me feel like I'll forever be nothing, like I'll never matter. And honestly, maybe I won't ever matter. I've spent so much time adjusting to what you need me to be, what you expected of me. I stopped even caring if I liked myself. And I don't. I hate myself and I hate that all I do is please other people. Beth, I'm on the way right now. Please just wait until I get there. We can talk. Okay. Actually, no, I will. Listen. I will. I promise. And you talk. I'm sorry. I know. I should have said it sooner. Yeah, you're right. You should have. And it's too late for sorry. At least this way you can finally put that college fund of mine towards Ben's dreams like you've always wanted to. Elizabeth, what are You talking about, what are you doing? Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth, please answer me. Beth, please pick up the phone. I'm 5 minutes away. Mommy, so sorry.

I smiled like the movie with Katniss Everdeen. No, silly. It's when we see who cries first from being hungry. I never lose anymore, but Millie still does. Her little sister, maybe 5, was sitting in the corner clutching her stomach. How long do you play this game? I asked, keeping my voice light. My record is three days, Ava beamed with pride. Daddy marks it on the fridge chart. Millie only made it one day before or she cried like a baby. My assistant Jackie shot me a glance. That's when I noticed how Ava's dress hung loose on her frame. That's impressive, I said, trying to keep my voice steady. Do you play this game a lot? Every week, sometimes twice. If we've been bad, like when I forgot to clean my room, I had to play for four days. Four days is a really long time without food, I said, watching her stuff crackers in her pockets. What happens when someone loses? They have to wait longer, daddy says. Only we kids need food every day. Millie whimpered from her corner. My tummy hurts all the time. Ava whipped around. Shut up. What's wrong with you? You'll lose points. Do you want to wait another week? My hands stilled on the book I was preparing to read. That seems like a long time for the game, not Really? Theo went nine days once, but then he fainted at school and the nurse got all weird about it. Now he's not allowed to play anymore. She said it was pity for Theo. Theo's your brother, foster brother. He went to live somewhere else. Daddy said he was too weak for our family. Ava, when did you eat last? I asked casually, like we were discussing the weather. She counted on her fingers. Tuesday, daddy says, I'm getting stronger. It was Saturday. This child hadn't eaten in four days and was out of it. I noticed Millie's hair was thin, patchy in places. Her arms looked like twigs. And what about breakfast or snacks? I prompted gently. Oh, no, that's cheating. When we play The Hunger Game, it's nothing at all. Not even milk. Water is okay, though. Daddy's not mean. The way she said it, like allowing water made. I'm generous. Sent ice through my veins. Well, it's story time. Everyone eats, I said firmly, pushing the entire snack tray toward them. Different rules here. While the other children arrived, I watched Ava carefully portion out food to her sister, whispering, eat slow so you don't throw up. My stomach turned. They've done this before, Ava, I said quietly during snack time. Does your mommy play the Hunger Game too? Sometimes, but she cheats. I caught her eating crackers in the bathroom once. Daddy made her play for a whole week after that. She kept crying and saying She was sorry, but rules are rules. I excused myself to get more supplies and called CPS for my office. I have two children here showing clear signs of systematic starvation, I whispered urgently. The older one hasn't eaten in four days and thinks it's a game. Back in the story room, I sat close to the girls. During reading time, Ava leaned against me and I could feel her ribs through her dress. Do you play other games at home? I asked. During craft time, the strong game, Millie piped up. We stand with our arms up until someone and drops them. Ava nodded. I lasted two hours yesterday. Daddy says we're building character. She showed me the underside of her arms. Bruises lined them where blood had pooled. Sometimes we play the quiet game in the cold shower. If you make noise, you stay longer. I documented everything on my phone while pretending to take pictures of their crafts. When Ava stood up, I noticed her legs were modeled with purple marks. Those look like they hurt, I said gently. Only weak kids feel pain, she recited. Daddy's Making us Strong for when the world gets hard. Their mother arrived to pick them up, designer purse swinging, looking annoyed. Come on, girls, we have training this afternoon. I handed Ava an extra bag of snacks for the road. Her eyes went wide. But I haven't earned food yet. Her mom shot me a look to see if I'd Catch on story time. Food is free, I said with an innocent smile. No earning required. As they left, Millie turned back and waved with a smile that broke my heart. Two hours later, CPS arrived at their house with police backup. The investigation revealed a nightmare. Food charts on the fridge showed Ava once went 82 hours without eating for talking back. But that wasn't the worst part. When they searched the house, they found Theo's room, the foster brother who went to live somewhere else. He hadn't gone anywhere. Full story on channel link below.

I found my work crush share crying in the break room, looking completely stressed. My dad's in the hospital, and I need to fly out tonight, but I can't find anyone to watch my kids. My ex won't answer, the babysitter I hired bailed, and I just. I can't afford to miss this flight, but I can't afford anything else either. She leaned against my shoulder, crying even harder. I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said, heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids. Three for at least two weeks. I waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest, around 14, looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work, Camilla. The middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, seven, wouldn't even look at me. They stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Cher hugged them quickly, told them to be good, and left for the airport. I stood there with three kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. First morning, I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed. She's not here, you know. You can stop trying, she said. Besides, you're Not her type. Mom doesn't date guys without kids. We've seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Shares, co workers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps. Everyone wanted to play dad until they realised three kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. Spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings. They hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive two weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy, be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Sometime within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Just leave me alone, he said, turning away. I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get mad at you or do anything without your permission. Not even tell your mom. But I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't have a dad. I Patted his head and walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. The next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rental G T R, strikingly white engine, purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved, wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now? I said loudly as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop, and quickly he hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said. I picked up the other two kids and took them to in and out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a helmet full of nachos, and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. Not bad, old man, Camilla said, watching her siblings enjoy the game. We made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard and everything to their mom with a caption we wish you were here. After that, things between me and the kids sort of changed. When the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom, I sat beside her bed reading out fairy tales. Until she fell asleep, I made the kids meals and lunch box

So I drove him straight into another state while he slept. Mr Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper just to throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he'd always had his favorite line. In the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into driver's ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my but dropped like a stone. Where do I turn? I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise, though with your steering straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchange looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight with you girls. Never know when we're Gonna stop or if we're gonna stop by the third lesson we discovered his pattern because nasty jokes for 20 minutes then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practice highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed he said when I veered slightly. I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife if we survive today's lesson that is three 3 teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon Sophia slightly veered and he exploded. Jesus are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high and why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My 5 year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I and then he was snoring head tilted back against the headrest looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realized he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up on the right And I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five North hanging over the highway. Like a dare, I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering. I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added, me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank back at the sleeping Mister Maya. And as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. Thirty minutes passed, then an hour and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up constantly with white.

I thought I was being a genius parent when my 11 year old son Wyatt kept begging me for money to buy Marvel rival skins every single day. He'd show me his phone with some new character outfit that cost $20 and ask if he could have it. Instead of just saying no or giving in, I decided this was the perfect chance to teach him about earning money through hard work. I spent a whole evening creating the most detailed chore chart ever. Each task had a specific dollar value based on difficulty and time. Taking out the trash was $2 while cleaning the bathroom was five. Washing dishes got $3. And picking up dog poop in the backyard earned four because nobody likes that job. I even laminated the chart and hung it on the fridge with magnets. Wyatt was so excited when I explained the system to him. He calculated that if he did every chore on the list each day, he could earn enough for a new skin in just four days. His eyes lit up when he realized he could actually get the Invisible Woman skin he'd been talking about non stop. We shook hands like business partners and I felt like parent of the year. The first week was absolutely magical. I'd come home from work to find the dishes already done and put away. His room was cleaner than it had been since we moved. In the dog poop that usually sat in the yard for days was picked up daily. He even started doing extra things that weren't on the chart, like organizing the garage and washing my car just to earn bonus money. I brag to everyone at work about my brilliant parenting move. My co workers were impressed and some even asked for copies of my chore chart to try with their own kids. I felt like I'd cracked the code on teaching kids responsibility while also getting help around the house. Wyatt was learning the value of hard work and I was getting a clean house without having to nag. By the second week, Wyatt had developed a whole routine. He'd wake up early to do some chores before school, then knock out the rest right when he got home. He kept track of his earnings in a little notebook and would show me his running total each night at dinner. It was more organized than most adults I knew and I was genuinely proud of him. Everything was going perfectly until I came home on a Tuesday afternoon to find the house exactly as I'd left it that morning. Dishes were piled in the sink and Wyatt's backpack was thrown on the floor instead of hung up. I figured maybe he was sick or had a lot of homework, so I didn't say anything at first. But when I went to let the dog out, I saw three days worth Of poop in the yard. I found Wyatt in his room playing Marvel rivals on his computer. When I asked about the dishes and dog poop, he didn't even look away from his screen.

I asked why. He said, because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6, 10. They make sound effects for everything, opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7, they'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8, they'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes. And apparently that's normal to them. 9, they'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car, groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10, they can sit in total silence for an hour staring at the wall. And when you ask what they're thinking about, they say nothing. And somehow they really mean nothing.

When my 7 year old sister told her she loved dad more, mom was making dinner when Emma ran up to her and yanked on her skirt. Mommy! Mommy, come come! Daddy's wearing my Elsa costume! He looks so funny! Mom chuckled, but said she was too busy to go look, and Emma jokingly responded, ooh, I'm Mommy! I cook, cook, cook. I'm too boring to have fun. She then giggled, that's why I love daddy more! She ran back to play. Mom laughed it off, but I could tell by her eyes that comment really stung her. The next day, mom joined in on the fort building. After dinner, she crawled through the blanket tunnels with Emma and even did silly voices for the stuffed animals. When Emma asked for ice cream after dinner, mom said yes immediately. Dad raised an eyebrow, but mom just winked at him, then proceeded to make Emma laugh by getting ice cream on Dad's nose and licking it off. A few days later, I watched mom and Emma rolling down the hill in our backyard. Mom's expensive birthday sundress got completely ruined with grass stains and MUD. Dad looked horrified, but mom just shrugged. Memories matter more than dresses. We all thought it was extremely cute until then. Mom's actions started becoming more than just fun. Dad came home from work with a new puzzle for him and Emma to do, and when mom saw it, she Immediately announced that and Emma were going for ice cream just as girls tonight. Dad's face fell, but he didn't argue. Even worse, this became a pattern. Every night, mom would plan some special activity for her and Emma that excluded dad completely. I remember one specific Saturday. During family drawing time the next day, mom kept whispering to Emma. I watched her encourage Emma to draw dad with a frown and write I love Mommy more at the top. Dad saw the picture and his shoulders slumped. Mom just beamed like she'd won something. A few days later, mom got finger paint and started painting directly on our living room walls with Emma. When dad tried to stop them, mom grabbed Emma's hand and they ran outside giggling. Me and dad spent three hours scrubbing the walls clean. Two days later, I was looking for Christmas decorations in the attic when I caught mom lifting Emma through the opening onto the roof. The roof had no safety rails and slanted sharply. I screamed at her to stop, and she rolled her eyes. We're just having fun. You're as boring as your father. The car accident happened on a Tuesday. Dad and I left Emma and mom in the car while we went into the store to grab snacks. But when we came out, what we saw made our jaws drop. Emma was behind the wheel of Mom's SUV. Mom was in the passenger seat urging, press harder on the Pedal, sweetie. Emma pressed too hard and crashed straight into a parked vehicle. The owner came rushing out minutes later. Dad immediately took the blame and handed over his insurance information plus 500 in cash. While mom was telling Emma she did great that night, I went to check on Emma. She was curled up in her princess bed, and when I sat down, she whispered, Mommy is starting to scare me. Dad and I staged an intervention the next morning. We sat mom down and explained she was frightening Emma with these dangerous activities. Mom's face went red. You're ganging up on the fun Parent. Emma loves me more now, she said. So we tried to reason with her, but she stormed out. The next day, dad discovered mom had drained their entire savings account. $4,000 gone. He found the receipt. She bought a massive commercial grade bouncy castle for the backyard. Emma will love this, she said when confronted. I came home from school a few days later to find Emma in the backyard holding Dad's axe. Blood was running down her leg from a gash. Mom stood nearby clapping, come on, sweetie, this is. Don't mind the cut. Tough girls don't cry. Emma looked like she was about to sob. I grabbed the axe, and dad carried Emma inside to bandage her leg. Mom followed us, yelling about how we were ruining everything. That night, we sat mom down and told her very bluntly, she either stops Or dad and I are leaving. She stopped at first, but when she realized we were serious, she agreed to let up. Well, that lasted for an entire two days. That's when we got the call directly from mom.

When my 7 year old sister told her she loved dad more, mom was making dinner when Emma ran up to her and yanked on her skirt. Mommy, Mommy, come, come. Daddy's wearing my Elsa costume. He looks so funny. Mom chuckled but said she was too busy to go look. And Emma jokingly responded, ooh, I'm Mommy. I cook, cook, cook. I'm too boring to have fun. She then giggled, that's why I love daddy more. She ran back to play. Mom laughed it off, but I could tell by her eyes that comment really stung her. The next day, mom joined in on the fort building. After dinner. She crawled through the blanket tunnels with Emma and even did silly voices for the stuffed animals. When Emma asked for ice cream after dinner, mom said yes. Immediately, dad raised an eyebrow, but mom just winked at him, then proceeded to make Emma laugh by getting ice cream on Dad's nose and licking it off. A few days later, I watched mom and Emma rolling down the hill in our backyard. Mom's expensive birthday sundress got completely ruined with grass stains and MUD. Dad looked horrified, but mom just shrugged. Memories matter more than dresses. We all thought it was extremely cute. Until then, Mom's actions started becoming more than just fun. Dad came home from work with a new puzzle for him and Emma to do. And when mom saw it, she Immediately announced that and Emma were going for ice cream just as girls tonight. Dad's face fell, but he didn't argue. Even worse, this became a pattern. Every night, mom would plan some special activity for her and Emma that excluded dad completely. I remember one specific Saturday during family drawing time the next day, mom kept whispering to Emma. I watched her encourage Emma to draw dad with a frown and write, I love Mommy more at the top. Dad saw the picture and his shoulders slumped. Mom just beamed like she'd won something. A few days later, mom got finger paint and started paint directly on our living room walls with Emma. When dad tried to stop them, mom grabbed Emma's hand and they ran outside giggling. Me and dad spent three hours scrubbing the walls clean. Two days later, I was looking for Christmas decoration in the attic when I caught mom lifting Emma through the opening onto the roof. The roof had no safety rails and flanked sharply. I screamed at her to stop and she rolled her eyes. We're just having fun. You're as boring as your father. The car incident happened on a Tuesday. Dad and I left Emma and mom in the car while we went into the store to grab snacks. But when we came out, what we saw made our jaws drop. Emma was in the wheel of Mom's SUV. Mom was in the passenger seat urging press harder on the Pedal, Sweetie. Emma pressed too hard and crashed straight into a parked vehicle. The owner came rushing out minutes later. Dad immediately took the blame and handed over his insurance information plus 500 in cash. While mom was telling Emma she did great that night, I went to check on Emma. She was curled up in her princess bed. And when I sat down, she whispered, Mommy is starting to scare me. Dad and I staged an intervention. The next morning we sat mom down and explained she was frightening Emma with these dangerous activities. Mom's face went red. You're ganging up on the fun parent. Emma loves me more now, she said. So we tried to reason with her, but she stormed out. The next day, dad discovered mom had drained their entire savings account, $4,000 gone. He found the receipt. She bought a massive commercial grade bouncy castle for the backyard. Emma will love this, she said, when confronted. I came home from school a few days later to find Emma in the backyard holding Dad's axe. Blood was running down her leg from a gash. Mom stood nearby clapping, come on, sweetie, this is, don't mind the cut. Tough girls, don't cry. Emma looked like she was about to sob. I grabbed the axe and dad carried Emma inside to bandage her leg. Mom followed us, yelling about how we were ruining everything that night. We sat mom down and told her very bluntly, she either stops Or dad and I are leaving. She stopped at first, but when she realised we were serious, she agreed to let up. Well, that lasted for an entire two days. That's when we got the call directly from mom. She was sobbing so hard we could barely understand her. I messed up. I messed up real bad. Come to.

I was 18 and technically an adult, but my parents still treated me like I was 12. My mom would go through my backpack every single day when I got home from school, checking my homework like I was in third grade. She'd read my text messages whenever she felt like it. And if I complained, she'd take my phone away for a week. My dad wasn't much better. He had this rule where I couldn't leave the house after six PM even on weekends. I wanted to hang out with friends. I had to give them a full essay about where I was going, who would be there and when I'd be back. The final straw was when they installed one of those tracking apps on my phone without telling me. I only found out because my friend Jake mentioned seeing my location pop up when he was trying to text me. I confronted them about it that night and my mom just shrugged and said it was for my safety. My dad backed her up saying as long as I lived under their roof, I followed their rules. Been working at this pizza place since I turned 16, saving up every paycheck except for what I needed for gas and lunch money. By the time I graduated high school, I had almost $4,000 saved up. I started looking at apartments online during my lunch breaks, telling myself I was just browsing. But the more I thought about it. The more I realized I could actually do this, found this tiny studio apartment about 20 minutes from my job. The rent was only 600 a month and the landlord said if I could prove I had a steady income and pay first month plus deposit, he'd rent to me. I went to look at it on a day my parents thought I was at work. It was small and kind of dingy, but it was mine. I filled out the application that same day. Two weeks later, he called and said I was approved. I could move in the following weekend. That's when it hit me that I was actually doing this. I felt sick to my stomach but also kind of excited. I started slowly moving my stuff out. Every day after work, I'd grab a backpack full of clothes or books and stash them in my car. I told my parents I was staying late to help close the restaurant, which wasn't totally a lie since I was picking up extra shifts to make sure I could afford everything. The hardest part was getting my bigger stuff out. I waited until they went to my aunt's house for Sunday dinner, something I'd gotten out of by saying I had to work. I loaded up my car with my dresser, my desk and my TV, left most of the furniture since it wasn't really mine anyway, but I took the stuff that mattered. I Left them a note on the kitchen counter. I kept it simple, told them I'd moved out, that I was safe and that I'd call them in a few days when I was settled. I said I needed space to figure out who I was as an adult and that I hoped they'd understand eventually. I left my house key next to the note. My phone started blowing up around 8 that night. Missed calls, texts, voice mails. My mom was crying and half of them my dad was yelling in the others. They wanted to know where I was, if I was okay, why I didn't talk to them first. They said they'd always supported me and couldn't understand why I do this to them. I turn my phone off and didn't turn it back on until the next morning. I had 37 missed calls and way too many texts to read through. I called them back and told them I was fine, gave them my address and said they could come see my place if they wanted. My mom showed up.

Like something in my brain goes, wow, yes, it's a good idea to rearrange my room right now. But I swear I hit all the phases. I'll be happy watching TikTok chilling. Then boom, it hits 2:00am and a wave of sadness comes. I'll start crying, acting all depressed and watching videos that aren't even sad. Then start reposting some of them. Like I'll come across a video of a father and daughter and be like, huh, that could be me and my dad if he didn't leave. Then I'll come across one of those top 10 funniest moments on the Kevin Lang Show and I'm there cracking up, trying to hold in my laugh so I don't wake anyone up. Then suddenly I come across one of those gym motivation videos yelling at me through the screen, you want to be known as lazy your whole life and I'll be taking it serious, thinking, hell no. Then they say drop down and do 10 push UPS. I do, but my noodle alarms are so weak, I can't even do one. So the walk of shame, climbing back in my bed. But no, the adrenaline is still there. I set an alarm at 6:00am to go for a run. So then I decide to go sleep. Suddenly, I'm hit with the most embarrassing memories flooding my head. Every move shifts to a different One, my brain is practically telling me, ha, remember this, you fucking loser. Eventually, I fall asleep, then wake up from the fuck ass alarm I set and be like, who the heck did I think I was? And go back to sleep. So moral of the story, just go to bed early before the 5 stages of grief hit you. More stories coming soon.

I didn't know guys will just stand in the shower for 10 minutes doing nothing, no water running, just standing there like they're waiting for a download to finish. The first time I walked in on it, I thought something was wrong. He looked at me all calm and said, I'm just mentally preparing. I've never looked at showers the same way. 2. I found out men treat fridges like treasure hunts. He'll open it five times in a row, stare like something new is going to spawn, sigh dramatically, and then eat plain cheese straight from the block. I once asked why he keeps checking. He said, in case a snack magically appears. Three, I didn't know guys hum to themselves during the most random tasks. My boyfriend will be cleaning the sink, humming what sounds like boss battle music, then suddenly switch to singing about how this sponge is my sword. I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said, but it still smells like me, so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said, because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6, 10. They make sound effects for everything, opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7, they'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8, they'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes. And apparently that's normal to them. 9, they'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car, groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10, they can sit in total silence for an hour staring at the wall. And when you ask what they're thinking about, they say nothing. And somehow they really mean nothing.

I mean, it was like I went on a date with like two different people. So at one point of the day, someone spilled something on her. I guess she started like freaking out about the spill. And I was like looking, I didn't see anything. Like I looked on her shirt. I looked on her, like everything she was wearing, like I don't see any spill. And then she's started going on like, oh, it's, it's on my shoe. You see spilled water on my shoe. And I look at her shoe and I don't see anything on her shoe.

Like what do you need me to do? Like I tried to be really helpful but I'm staring at her shoes and I'm like, dude, there's nothing here. So it was just a over reaction to not spilling wine on her shoe that it was way more than an over reaction. And it got to the point where I had to take her away from the group and like calm her down because she was like flipping out about this imaginary thing. Was she about ready to like crack open a wine glass and cut somebody with it? I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if she.

So I made sure he saw exactly how much I didn't need him. Uncle Wayne was worth millions but lived like a miser, constantly testing our family to see who was worthy of his money. Every holiday was an audition where cousins would compete for his approval like desperate contestants on a reality show. I'm leaving everything to whoever proves they don't need it, announce at family dinners while everyone kissed his ass and hung on his every word. My cousins would bring him expensive gifts they couldn't afford, offer to clean his house for free, practically beg for his attention and validation. They'd research his interests and pretend to share his hobbies. My cousin Kyle even switched his major to business because Uncle Wayne mentioned he respected entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, I brought nothing and sat in the corner reading a book, completely disinterested in his little power games. Grace doesn't seem to care about family, he'd say loud enough for me to hear. Testing to see if I'd scramble for his approval like the others. You're right, I'd reply without looking up from my book. I don't care about your money either. Always made him pause. While my cousins were falling over themselves to prove their worth, I was actively proving my indifference. While they fought over who could drive him to appointments and grocery shop for him, I got a second job and started saving Every penny. While they argued about his will, I was building my own future. When they'd ask why I never visited Uncle Wayne, I'd say, he has plenty of volunteers. I found his manipulation disgusting. Watching grown adults debase themselves for money made me sick. I'd rather be broke with dignity than rich through desperation. My cousins thought I was crazy. Don't you want financial security? Anna would ask. I'm setting myself up without begging. Tell her. While they spent their weekends doing his yard work and running his errands, I was working overtime and taking online courses to improve my skills. While they were buying him birthday presents and Christmas gifts, I was investing in my education and building an emergency fund. The dynamic was fascinating to watch. The more desperate they became for his approval, the more he seemed to enjoy withholding it. More I ignored him, the more curious he became about me. At family gatherings, he'd try to bait me into conversations about money and success. I'd give polite, brief responses and go back to whatever I was doing. I wasn't rude, but I wasn't performing for him either. Brace. What are your career plans? He'd ask in front of everyone. Working on it, I'd say, simply not elaborating. This drove him crazy because he couldn't figure out my angle. Everyone else was transparent in their attempts to impress him, but I genuinely didn't seem to care about his opinion or his money. The day he Died. Everyone gathered for the will reading like vultures circling fresh prey. My cousins have been speculating for years about who would inherit what. They'd made alliances and enemies within the family based on their perceived chances. The lawyer cleared his throat and began reading. Mister Wayne has left his entire estate, valued at $3.2 million, to his niece Grace, with a note that reads, she was the only one who never asked me for anything because she was too busy building something for herself. The silence in that room was deafening.

My mom looked me dead in the eye and said, if you disappeared tomorrow, no one would even notice. Everyone laughed except me. I quietly raised my hot dog and said, challenge accepted. That night, I packed everything into two suitcases and left my key on the kitchen counter. No, no, no. Goodbye. Just gone. I've been the family doormat for 29 years. The one who organised every holiday, baked every birthday cake, and cleaned up everyone's messes while they took selfies without me. So when mom made that joke at our B B Q. With my aunts and siblings all laughing, something inside me just clicked. I moved three hours away to a lakeside cabin, blocked everyone's numbers, and started over as Jade instead of JD, the nickname that made me feel like a child. For the first week, my phone stayed silent, exactly like mom predicted. But week two 2. My brother called 47 times. Turns out nobody knew how to work the washing machine I've been maintaining for years. Their clothes piled up like a laundry mountain until he finally had to buy new underwear instead of figuring out the spin cycle. Week 3, my sister showed up at my old job, crying, begging my former co workers for my new number. She had a family emergency, a k a. Couldn't figure out how to renew her car registration, the same registration I'd been handling for her since she was 16. My Co workers told her I'd moved states away. She broke down in the parking lot because she'd never even Learned where the D M V. Was located. She ended up paying $300 to some sketchy guy who promised to handle it. Month 2. Dad drove to every apartment complex in the city looking for me. He'd never realised I was the one who remembered everyone's medication schedules, grocery lists, and which bills were due. When without me, he missed his blood pressure medication for three weeks and had to go to urgent care. The doctor asked if he had family support at home. Dad just stared at the floor and mumbled something about his daughter being away. Mom had a complete breakdown when she realised I'd been handling all the family birthdays, anniversary reminders and doctor appointments for decades. She forgot her own sister's birthday for the first time in 40 years and had to hear about it at Sunday dinner. The woman who said nobody would notice was now hiring a professional organiser for $200 a week to do what I've done for free my entire adult life. Even then, the organiser quit after two weeks because mom kept asking her to just handle it like Jade used to. My aunt called mom crying because no one had organised the annual Christmas cookie exchange. It was complete chaos. People brought store bought cookies. Nobody knew the gift exchange rules. I've been coordinating for a decade, and three families showed Up on the wrong day. Meanwhile, I was learning pottery at the community centre, taking morning hikes by the lake, and sleeping in without someone banging on my door, needing me to fix their problems before 7:00am. For the first time in my life, my calendar belonged to me. Last week, mom finally tracked down my number through my old college roommate, Sarah, who she'd somehow found on LinkedIn after calling my high school looking for contacts. She called SOB

My 6 year old nephew absolutely destroyed my sister at Thanksgiving dinner. And honestly, she deserved it. My sister Emma has always been obsessed with appearances, perfect makeup, designer clothes, constantly taking selfies. She's the type who spends two hours getting ready just to go to target. At family dinners, she'd always make these passive aggressive comments about everyone else's life choices. So we're all sitting around the table last Thanksgiving. Emma shows up an hour late because she had to get her nails done. She's wearing this ridiculous white dress to a family dinner where we're eating gravy and cranberry sauce. Classic Emma move. She immediately starts her usual routine, comments about how Mom's stuffing has too much salt this year, mentions how Uncle Rick should probably lay off the dinner rolls, makes this big show of only eating tiny portions because she's watching her figure. Then she turns to my brother Jake, who just started community college. So Jake, still taking those little classes. When are you going to get a real degree? Jake just stared at his plate. The kids working two jobs to pay for school. Emma kept going. She asked my cousin about her starter apartment and wondered when she'd get a grown up job. She even made a comment about dad's old truck in the driveway saying it was embarrassing. The whole time my nephew Tyler was just sitting there eating his Turkey and Watching Tyler's Jake's 6 year old son, super quiet kid, usually just plays with his food and does say much during adult conversations. Emma was on a roll. She started talking about her new boyfriend's BMW and how they're looking at condos downtown, really laying it on thick about how successful she is compared to everyone else. Then she made her biggest mistake. She looked at Tyler and said, Tyler, sweetie, make sure you study hard in school so you don't end up like your daddy. Okay? The table went dead silent. Jake's face turned red. Mom literally gasped. Dad put down his fork and just stared at Emma. But Tyler. Tyler just looked up from his mashed potatoes, blinked those big innocent eyes and said in the sweetest voice ever, Aunt Emma, why?

He finally woke up. My husband made me promise we would keep things normal after the baby was born because he read online that babies need to adapt to your life, not the other way around. I agreed because I was nine months pregnant and too tired to argue about his parenting theories from Reddit. The second we got home from the hospital with our 3 day old daughter, he disappeared into his gaming room. I stood in the hallway holding our screaming baby. He told his online friends he was finally back. I spent the first three months doing every single night feeding while he slept peacefully in our bed. He actually bought special noise canceling headphones so the crying wouldn't disturb his precious eight hours of sleep. You look like you're about to drop dead, my Sister Mindy said when she showed up at my front door. I hadn't seen her since the baby shower because she lived six hours away. When was the last time you ate actual food or slept more than an hour? She dropped her bags and immediately took the baby. Baby from my shaking arms. You have lost at least 20 pounds and your hands won't stop trembling. She pulled me into the first real hug I had gotten since giving birth. I didn't realize how much I needed a hug. Where is your husband? Pointed down the Hall where he was screaming about someone stealing his kill. Mindy listened for a second, then her whole face changed completely. You have been doing this alone while he plays video games all day, haven't you? Before I could answer, she said, go shower right now while I watch the baby. Then we are going to talk about whatever this mess. She started washing the mountain of bottles that had been sitting for days. You are not doing another night alone while that waste of space pretends you don't exist. I stood under the hot water and cried harder than when I was in labor. When I came back downstairs, Mindy had the baby sleeping peacefully. You look exhausted, she said, actually looking at my face. When's the last time someone asked how you're doing? I couldn't remember. My husband hadn't asked since we left the hospital three months ago. He'd asked if the baby was fed, if she napped, but never once. How are you holding up? Your husband games every night until 4:00am, Mindy asked. Look, looking at his empty gaming chair. My ex did that. I ended up hospitalized from exhaustion. He didn't visit. That hit hard. Even strangers at the grocery store asked how I was doing, but not him. I came back downstairs from my shower and stopped in the hallway when I heard voices in the kitchen. My husband had actually left his gaming room and was talking to Mindy, who was still feeding Our daughter. We don't need any help, he was saying with obvious irritation in his voice. Everything's been fine here without you showing up and judging how we do things. Andy kept calmly feeding the baby while she responded, fine. Your wife has lost 20 pounds and hasn't slept in three months. I watched him grab an energy drink from the fridge and crack it open aggressively. She wanted a baby so badly, and now she complains about everything, he said. Maybe if she wasn't so dramatic about normal mom stuff, we wouldn't have issues. Andy finally looked up at him with cold eyes. Normal mom stuff? She told me she thinks about leaving you. His hand froze halfway to his mouth with the energy drink. She fantasizes about packing up and disappearing because raising a baby alone

My phone rang. This is Disney staff. Your child is at lost and found. My heart stopped. What happened? Your son says his family told him to wait by the Mad Tea party while they got fast passes. That was four hours ago. He's been asking every cast member where his mommy went. Four hours? My hands were shaking as I called my ex immediately. Where's Carter? Oh, he's fine. We're back at the Grand Floridian pool. Kids his age get tired of rides anyway. Her voice was slurred. She'd been drinking since lunch. You left him at the park alone? She sighed like I was being overdramatic. Relax, James. Disney's literally the safest place on earth. He'll figure it out. Besides, we paid good money for this adults only vacation. Adults only? He's your son. Look, Paul wanted to do the grown up rides without a whining kid slowing us down. Carter can handle a few hours by himself. Builds character. We're not helicopter parents like you. I was two states away in Chicago on a business trip. The next flight to Orlando wasn't until 6:00am, and every earlier flight was completely booked. Sir, the Disney employee continued, we can keep him overnight in our family services center, but we need proper documentation and emergency contacts. He's asking for you specifically. That's when I remembered something that made my blood boil. Last Month. My ex had posted all over Facebook and Instagram about planning her child free Disney adult experience with her new husband. Photos of expensive cocktails at Victoria and Albert's. Captions like finally doing Disney the right way. No kids, no stress. She'd even joined Facebook groups about Disney without children and posted countdown photos. She'd literally advertised her plan to abandon our son for a booze filled vacation while still on the phone with Disney security. I started screenshotting everything. Her posts, the time stamps, comments from friends encouraging her adults only Disney trip, her recent check ins at Disney bars during park hours. I sent it all to my lawyer before I even hung up. I'm flying down tonight. I told the cast member. Please don't let him out of your sight. I'll cover any cost.

I forwarded it to Catherine immediately. Catherine's response was swift. She filed a motion citing the judge's order about medical appointments requiring both parents consent. Within hours, my ex backtracked, claiming she'd made an error with the dates. Friday arrived with my usual pickup time. I sat in my car outside my ex's house watching the clock. Four PM came and went, no sign of the kids. I texted through the app, keeping everything documented. No response. At 4:30, I knocked on the door. My ex answered with a fake surprised expression. She claimed the kids were at a friend's birthday party and she'd forgotten to tell me. I asked for the address. She said she'd have to check and get back to me. I waited in my car documenting everything Catherine had warned me about these games. Stay calm, follow the process. Don't give them ammunition. An hour later, my ex emerged with the kids. They walked slowly, heads down, my daughter gripping her brother's hand. The drive to my house was silent. They stared out the window while my daughter clutched her backpack like a shield. At home, they went straight to their room. Without the usual excitement about weekend activities, I made their favourite dinner, hoping to ease the tension. They picked at their food, exchanging worried glances when I asked about school. They gave one word answers. When I suggested a movie, they shook their heads. That night, I heard crying from their room. I found Jake curled up in his sister's bed, both of them trembling. I sat on the floor beside them, not wanting to crowd their space. Eventually, my daughter whispered.

Then her entire family started cheering. But when I showed them the real reason she wanted a divorce, they kicked her out instead. It was our annual Christmas Eve dinner at my in law's house. Sarah had been acting strange for weeks, staying late at work, being secretive with her phone, picking fights over nothing. But I figured we'd work through it like we always did. Her whole family was there. Parents, siblings, cousins, the works. Everyone seemed normal until Sarah stood up during dessert and announced she had something important to share. She pulled out an envelope and handed it to me with this weird smile. Merry Christmas, honey. This is my gift to you. Inside were divorce papers already signed, already notarized, ready to file. The room went completely silent for about three seconds, then her brother Dave started slow clapping. Her sister Emma actually laughed out loud. Her mom nodded like this was expected. Finally, her dad said, reaching over to pat Sarah on the shoulder, we've been waiting for this. I just sat there holding the papers, trying to process what was happening. They'd planned this. All of them knew. We never thought you were right for her, Dave said, grinning. Sarah deserves someone with more ambition, someone who can actually provide for her. Her mom chimed in, you've been holding her back for years. He could do so much better. Sarah was beaming, soaking up their support. She Orchestrated this whole humiliation. Probably fantasizing about this moment for months. But here's the thing. They didn't know. Two weeks ago, I'd hired a private investigator. Sarah's behavior had gotten so suspicious. She wasn't working late. She was meeting her boss at hotels. The same married boss who'd been mentoring her for the past year. I pulled out my phone and opened the folder of photos the PI had sent me that morning. You know what, Sarah? You're absolutely right. Should get divorced. Her smug expression faltered slightly. Especially since I found out about you and Richard. The color drained from her face. Her family looked confused. I held up my phone, showing them a crystal clear photo of Sarah and her boss kissing in a hotel parking lot. Date stamp from three days ago. Your daughter's been having an affair with her married boss for eight months. Same guy.

In my village, parents buried their daughters alive for 24 hours on their 16th birthday in wooden boxes underground. Because they believed facing death would make us worthy of marriage. Every woman I knew had survived it. My mother, my aunts, all my female cousins. They shared the same hollow eyes, the same way of flinching at small spaces. Nobody talked about what happened in those boxes. But everyone knew girls who hadn't come back up. I watched them bury my cousin Soledad when I was 14. The men lowered her pine coffin into the six foot hole while the women sang funeral hymns. They gave her one bottle of water and a bell to ring if she was dying. But ringing meant failure, meant weakness. Meant your bloodline was cursed with cowardice. When they pulled Soledad up twenty four hours later, she couldn't stop shaking. Her lips were blue. She slept with lights on for the rest of her life, but she never rang the bell. My mother started preparing me that same year. She locked me in our root cellar for hours to practice darkness. She'd make me lie in the bathtub with boards across the top to simulate the coffin. She'd restrict my breathing with scarves around my chest to prepare for the weight of earth. I had two years to plan. Two years of sneaking out at night to dig. The burial field was marked with white Stones where each girl would go. I found mine and dug my own salvation. Six feet down, then three feet sideways. A hidden tunnel with air pipes I stole from construction sites. I stock piled water, food, flashlights, even sedatives from my grandmother's medicine cabinet. My 16th birthday arrived like a death sentence. The entire village gathered at dawn. My father had built my coffin himself, carved with flowers. My mother braided white ribbons in my hair.

Didn't matter if you were 12, 13 or 14, the blood meant you were ready for a husband at least three times your age. I grew up with this idea. So in my head it didn't seem that bad until I turned 11 because that's when I watched my cousin Mariam get promised to a 43 year old man just three days after her first period. His previous two wives had died before turning 20. That was the first night I decided to stop eating enough food, not because I was fat and not because I hated food, but because if I noticed the skinnier girls in my family would be the last ones to get their period and I knew it was my only option. I later Learned that your body actually needs to have enough fat before starting puberty. Lol. The other girls called me skeleton, but I didn't care. Other girls my age were already promised to men who had children older than them. That didn't mean they stopped prepping me to be a wife though. Every Friday from 1:00am to 10:00am I was made to serve meals to male family members for hours without speaking. And of course if I made eye contact or noise while serving, then I would receive 10 lashes of the belt. I was forced to hold burning pots without other. It's to tough enough soft hands for kitchen work. And every night, my mom put skin whitening cream all over my face so I could be beautiful. And other than the secret starvation, I was the perfect daughter. I played the part with zero complaints and always talked about how excited I was to have kids. But when I was 14 and still periodless, I found something that changed everything. For context, we were in the USA the whole time. Lol. My mom had just convinced us that all of this was normal and that any girl who didn't do this was bound to die alone, as well as being ugly and useless. Until one teacher forced me to have a meeting with her because I had accidentally worn a T-shirt to school and she saw how skinny I was. When she walked out to go to the bathroom, she had forgotten to lock her drawer. Inside were books about marriage laws, pamphlets with titles like your rights as a young teenager and when culture becomes crime. As I read, my jaw dropped. It was the first time I had been introduced to the idea that marriage under 18.

And I don't mean that in the cute she still hung up on her ex kind of way. I mean it like if you're happy, she'll find a way to make you miserable. Then blame it on her tragic love story. The one true love, some guy named Ethan she met at a college party four years ago. They hooked up once. He never called. And somehow that became her origin story for being a piece of shit. It started with her best friend since kindergarten, Jess. One weekend, Mia stayed over at Jess's place and by Monday, Jess's boyfriend was sending Mia good morning texts. When just found them together in her own bed, Mia actually said, you don't understand what it's like to lose your soulmate. Just never spoke to her again. Then came our cousin's engagement party. Mia showed up in a dress that cost more than my rent, got wine drunk and cornered the groom in the bathroom. His exact words later, she kept saying I reminded her of someone special.

By the time I met Ryan, I knew the drill. I kept him away from family dinners, deleted Mia from my social media and told him my sister was going through something and needed space. Two years it worked. We got engaged last spring. Small ceremony planned, nothing fancy, just us and close friends. I made one mistake, though. I mentioned it at Mom's birthday dinner. Mia's eyes lit up like Christmas came early. I'm so happy for you, she said while hugging me. When do I get to meet him? A week later, Ryan showed me his phone, laughing. Your sister found me on Instagram with some fake account. Look at these messages. We read them to.

Send help. Turns out my ex, Kimberly from college, had my kid and never told me. She got busted for running an identity theft ring and told them I was the father to keep the kid out of foster care. The DNA test came back positive yesterday. I'm still in shock. So this morning this tall girl with my exact nose shows up at my door with a social worker. She's wearing clothes that don't fit and carrying a trash bag. She looks me up and down and says, you're shorter than I imagined. Great first impression. The social worker hands me a folder thick with paperwork and says Kimberly told her you abandoned them. Just so you know what you're dealing with. Then she leaves us standing there in my doorway, awkward silence. I ask if she's hungry. She shrugs and says, mom always said you were a deadbeat who ran away. When you found out she was pregnant, did you actually know about me? My heart sinks. No, I had absolutely no idea you existed. Kimberly just disappeared one day, sophomore year, never returned my calls. She nods like she expected that answer. Yeah, that sounds like mom. I show her to my spare room, which is basically just a desk and an air mattress. She has one garbage bag Of clothes, a beat up laptop held together with duct tape, and a worn paperback book. That's it, 15 years of life. Is this okay for now, I ask. We can get you actual furniture this weekend. She just stares at the room. It's bigger than what I had before. I order pizza for dinner because I literally have nothing else in the house. She eats like she hasn't seen food in days, which honestly might be true. When I ask what her favorite foods are, she just shrugs and says whatever is available. Later that evening, I hear typing, fast typing. I peek in and she's on some coding website building what looks like a complex game with multiple levels. The code is actually pretty sophisticated. I knock. What are you working on? She minimizes the screen quickly. Nothing important. Come on, I saw it. That looked like Javascript. Pretty advanced stuff. She hesitates, then reopens it. I'm teaching myself programming. Mom said college was for rich kids who could afford to waste time, but I figured I could learn everything online and maybe get a job someday. This girl taught herself coding while living with a criminal who told her education was pointless. I pull up my own laptop. I'm a software engineer at a tech start. Want me to show you some tricks? For the first time since she walked in, she actually smiles. Three hours later, we're debugging code together and she's explaining algorithms I Learned In graduate school, she's built this entire RPG from scratch with custom graphics and a leveling system. How long did this take you, I ask. About 8 months. I work on it when Mom's out. I realized she probably coded this while Kimberly was out committing crimes. This is incredible. Seriously, this is better than some games I've seen professionals make. She gets quiet. You really think so? Mom said it was stupid kids stuff. Your mom was wrong about a lot of things. She looks at me sideways. Are you going to send.

I'm calling because Brett, is that real? That's your roommate? Yes, sort of. Yes. Is it like a roommate? Air quotes here. Look, okay, Brett recently went out with a girl who listens to our show and then he blew her off and she gave me this phone number to call to get a hold of Brett. So, okay, is this not, this is not Brett's phone. This is not Brett's phone? No, this is my phone. But why would Brett? He does give out my phone number every now and then. Brett gives out your phone number? Yeah, I mean, oh my God, this is hilarious. Can you explain to me what the hell is going on? Yeah, so I don't want to say his real name cause this, I guess this is on the radio, but Brett came up with this plan, which is actually kind of a genius, but Brett is not a real person. What? What? My roommate just goes on these dating sites and what he does if he Has a profile. He's got his picture. He's, he's charming. He's got a good job. He, whatever. And apparently, girls really love the name Brett. Oh. So he sets up dates with, you know, two or three girls at the same location. And when he gets to that location and the girls are there, he looks in and then picks the one he actually wants to go out with. And it goes from there. Are you kidding me? What? Shut up. And then the other girls have my phone number. They call him or text him or something. So you guys work together on this? Yeah, sort of. I mean, I'll take phone calls for Brett or I'll text for Brett. You know, you sound like this is just a normal phone call for you. Do you, a lot of people call you and ask for Brett? Yeah, I get a couple of phone calls. They, they are usually from girls. So what threw me at first was you don't sound like a girl. I feel like one. So when a girl is sitting by herself, stood up at a bar and texting about where you are, you're the one that's actually texting them and saying that, oh, something came up? Yeah, sometimes, unless he chooses the girl that has my number and then, then it's a whole other thing. But you guys, usually I'm the one texting. Well, that's, that is a very elaborate scheme. And what do you Get out of it. I mean, he, at least he's going on the dates. Why are you doing this for him? Uh, you know, I'm bored. So it's boring. Oh, my God. That is you. Why are you, you sound like, it sounds so much like you don't care at all. Like you're just like, at least be like nervous and trying to cover it up. It sounds like you don't care one bit.

I was the first person in my family to go to college. My dad worked construction, my mom cleaned houses, and my little brother Jake gave up his bedroom so I could have a quiet space to study. When I got my acceptance letter to State University, I ran through the house screaming that I got a full scholarship. I didn't. I got partial aid that covered about 60%. The rest would be $28,000. My first year alone. Stood in the financial aid office staring at those numbers, knowing my parents would take out loans they couldn't afford, or call every distant relative begging for help. They'd already sacrificed so much. So I walked to the student loan office down the hall and signed papers for a private loan. I told myself I'd pay it back on my own after graduation. The first payment came due six months later, while I was still in school. $240 a month. I got a job shelving books at the campus library for $8 an hour, and picked up tutoring sessions for kids who struggled with math. Between classes, I'd run to work. Between work, I tutor until midnight. My parents called every Sunday asking how my scholarship was going. I told them it was great. My mom would cry happy tears, talking about how proud she was that her smart daughter got everything paid for. Every month I made that payment. Sometimes I'd eat nothing but ramen. Noodles for three weeks straight. When my roommates went out for pizza, I'd say I wasn't hungry. When they asked why I worked so many hours with a full ride, I joke that I was saving up for something special. By graduation, the debt had grown to $53,000. Interest kept piling on top of interest. I still said nothing. I got a job in marketing in Chicago and moved to the smallest studio apartment I could find. It it was basically a closet with a hot plate, but rent was only 800 a month. My parents visited once and asked why I lived somewhere so tiny when I made decent money. I told them I was being responsible and saving for a house. Really? I was drowning. Every single month I transfer money to that loan. I walked 40 minutes to work instead of taking the bus. I bought clothes from thrift stores and told people I was into vintage fashion. I never went to movies or bars. When co workers invited me out, I'd make excuses about being tired or having plans. My friends thought I was incredibly disciplined. They joke about my monk like lifestyle and ask for budgeting advice. If only they knew I was living on peanut butter sandwiches and splitting single meals into two days of food. The worst part was lying to my family. When Jake started applying to colleges, he'd call asking for advice about scholarships. I'd help him with applications while knowing His chances were slim. When my parents mentioned how expensive college was getting, I'd nod and agree while making another payment on my secret debt. Five years passed.

But whenever I ask if he wants to hang out on the weekend, he, like, he always comes up with an excuse about why he can't. So you're dating a married guy? Basically. See, that's what my friend said she was like. Any guy that prefers dating during the week but won't see you on the weekends either has a weekend girl or is married. And you're his secret side piece. Okay, before we get too far into this, what is this guy's name? Jonathan. Okay, and you said it's been about a month or so? Yes. Okay, let me ask the stupid question here. Does this guy work on the weekends? No, he's. He's an investment broker. So they don't even do business on the weekends except maybe play golf. Okay, see, an investment broker. He just sounds married. It's a married person job. I mean, I. I guarantee he's married, has kids and everything. Okay, pump your brakes here. When. When you guys go out? Heather, you said it's during the week? Yes. Does he ever seem like he's trying to be secretive when you're together? And by that, I mean, like, does he say, let's meet somewhere instead of picking you up? Does he take you places that are like 45 minute drives out of town? That kind of stuff? No, not really. We're pretty Open with our dating. So like, for instance, like on Valentine's Day, he took me to the melting pot and he kissed me in the parking lot in front of everybody. So. Okay, it doesn't mean he's not married. I mean, what if his family like, lives in another town and he just works here? I don't know. I mean, I met him on a dating website and he basically talked about how hard dating is. He told me about his ex girlfriend. He just doesn't sound like he's married. Yeah, but at the same time, I mean, he could have just been making all of that up. We know people like that. Okay, so. So you want us to do what, Heather? Find out if he's married. That would be a great start, yeah. Okay. And I guess maybe find out why he's always busy on the weekends. I mean, maybe he just likes to have alone time on the weekends. We don't know, but we can find out. Hang on the line so we can get his number from you. Okay? Okay. Okay. How much money do you wanna put on this whole married thing? How much money? Yeah, how much money you wanna bet? I don't know. I don't wanna bet money. I mean, it's. It's dirty work Wednesday. How about this? How about if. Alright, if he is, if he's married, like you think, I will take you to chick fil A. But if he's not married, Then you have to take me and Shaggy to Pizza Hut Buffet today for lunch. Well, get ready to buy me lunch, because this guy is married. Alright, well we're gonna find out when we come back.

I was 18 and technically an adult, but my parents still treated me like I was 12. My mom would go through my backpack every single day when I got home from school, checking my homework like I was in third grade. She'd read my text messages whenever she felt like it. And if I complained, she'd take my phone away for a week. My dad wasn't much better. He had this rule where I couldn't leave the house after six PM even on weekends. If I wanted to hang out with friends, I had to give them a full essay about where I was going, who would be there and when I'd be back. The final straw was when they installed one of those tracking apps on my phone without telling me. I only found out because my friend Jake mentioned seeing my location pop up when he was trying to text me. I confronted them about it that night and my mom just shrugged and said it was for my safety. My dad backed her up, saying as long as I lived under their roof, I followed their rules. Been working at this pizza place since I turned 16, saving up every paycheck except for what I needed for gas and lunch money. By the time I graduated high school, I had almost $4,000 saved up. I started looking at apartments online during my lunch breaks, telling myself I was just browsing. But the More I thought about it, the more I realized I could actually do this. Found this tiny studio apartment about 20 minutes from my job. The rent was only 600 a month and the landlord said if I could prove I had a steady income and pay first month plus deposit, he'd rent to me. I went to look at it on a day my parents thought I was at work. It was small and kind of dingy, but it was mine. I filled out the application that same day. Two weeks later, he called and said I was approved. I could move in the following weekend. That's when it hit me that I was actually doing this. I felt sick to my stomach but also kind of excited. I started slowly moving my stuff out. Every day after work, I'd grab a backpack full of clothes or books and stash them in my car. I told my parents I was staying late to help close the restaurant, which wasn't totally a lie since I was picking up extra shifts to make sure I could afford everything. The hardest part was getting my bigger stuff out. I waited until they went to my aunt's house for Sunday dinner, something I'd gotten out of by saying I had to work. I loaded up my car with my dresser, my desk and my TV, left most of the furniture since it wasn't really mine anyway, but I took the stuff that mattered. I left them a note on the kitchen counter. I kept it simple, told them I'd moved out, that I was safe and that I'd call them in a few days when I was settled. I said I needed space to figure out who I was as an adult and that I hoped they'd understand eventually. I left my house key next to the note. My phone started blowing up around 8 that night. Missed calls, texts, voice mails. My mom was crying in half of them. My dad was yelling in the others. They wanted to know where I was, if I was okay, why I didn't talk to them first. They said they'd always supported me and couldn't understand why I do this to them. I turned my phone off and didn't turn it back on until the next morning. I had 37 missed calls and way too many texts to read through. I called them back and told them I was fine, gave them my address and said they could come see my place if they wanted. My mom showed up.

Maya was the kind of teacher who got off on making students miserable. In AP history, he'd lean over your desk during tests, breathing coffee breath down your neck while tapping his pen on your paper, just throw you off. And when he handed back essays drowned in red ink, he'd always had his favorite line in the real world, this wouldn't fly. I spent all junior year counting down to summer, marking days off my calendar like a prisoner, thinking I'd finally be free of his polyester blazers and power trips. So when I walked into drivers ed two weeks later and saw him sitting behind the instructor's desk, my dropped like a stone. Where do I turn? I asked during our first lesson, gripping the wheel nervously. You don't turn unless I say to, he barked, making me swerve slightly. Just assume you're going straight until I say otherwise. Though with your steering, straight is a pretty loose term. The two other girls in the backseat exchanged looks through the rearview mirror. When Sophia gripped the wheel too tight, he chuckled. Death grip won't help you drive better, sweetheart. This isn't a strength test. Emily stalled at a stop sign and he slapped his knee, laughing. And this is why I keep my seatbelt extra tight with you girls. Never know when we're gonna Stop or if we're gonna stop. By the third lesson, we discovered his pattern. He'd make his nasty jokes for 20 minutes, then use the afternoon drives as nap time while we practice highway driving. Don't worry about that curb you just kissed, said when I beard slightly. I'm sure it'll recover from the trauma. Unlike my neck. When Sophia asked about parallel parking, he laughed. You can barely handle forward parking and you wanna try parallel? That's adorable. He spent the entire next lesson bragging about his important dinner plans with his wife. If we survive today's lesson, that is three teenage girls driving. I should update my will. One afternoon, Sophia slightly veered and he exploded. Jesus, are you trying to collect mailboxes? Cause you're doing great. He wiped tears from laughing so hard. You know, girls like you three are why insurance rates are so high. And why driving instructors need hazard pay. It's funny because it's true. Then he made his final comparison. My 5 year old nephew has better control of his big wheel than you girls have of this car. He was still chuckling when he added, just try not to kill us while I. And then he was snoring, head tilted back against the headrest. I looked at Emily and Sophia in the rearview mirror and something passed between us. That's when I realized he told me to never turn unless he said so. The interstate entrance was coming up on the right. And I could see the big green sign marking I ninety five North hanging over the highway like a dare. I tilted my head slightly toward it and Emily caught my glance, following my eyes to the sign before whispering, I didn't hear him say turn, while Sophia nodded slowly and added, me neither. I glanced down at the fuel gauge showing a full tank, then back at the sleeping Mister Maya, and as we approached the on ramp and I felt the car naturally wanting to continue straight onto the interstate, I took a deep breath and tightened my grip on the wheel. Well, he did say to follow his instructions exactly. The merge onto the interstate was smooth, and Mister Maya kept snoring while the highway stretched endlessly ahead. 30 minutes passed, then an hour, and his phone started buzzing in the cup holder with increasing frequency. We passed the welcome to New Jersey sign after two hours, making Emily stifle a nervous giggle as his phone lit up constantly with white.

My daughter had asked to sleep in my room for the third time in a row. She's 5, so I assume she was having nightmares or maybe she was going through a clingy phase. When she asked for the fourth time, I said yes. And as I was tucking her in, I asked why she kept asking to sleep in my room. She couldn't look at me as she told me, because mommy's friend gets into bed with me when you're gone. Her words didn't fully register at first. I asked her what she meant and she repeated it, adding that Mommy says it's okay because he's like family. I couldn't sleep at all that night. The next morning, I told my wife what our daughter had said and asked if anyone had been over recently. She brushed it off almost instantly, laughing a little and saying our daughter probably meant a stuffed animal or had made something up. She said, you know how kids are and change the subject. The way she said it was off as if she was prepared for that question and had her answer ready. A few days later, I told her I had to leave town for a short work trip. In reality, I stayed in a nearby hotel and logged into the security cameras I had installed last year after a neighbor's house had been broken into. I'd almost forgotten they were even still Active the next day. I got a motion alert around nine thirty PM from the hallway camera. I opened the feed. I saw a man I didn't recognize. He kissed my wife who entered our bedroom right after. But the man kept walking through the hallway and went straight into my daughter's room. He just walked in like he belonged there and my wife was fine with it. I was so scared for my daughter. I instantly got in my car and drove straight home. When I walked through the door, I didn't say a word, not even when my wife popped out of our room and nervously asked me what I was doing back home so early.

Like something in my brain goes, wow, yes, it's a good idea to rearrange my room right now. But I swear I hit all the phases. I'll be happy watching TikTok chilling. Then boom, it hits 2:00am and a wave of sadness comes. I'll start crying, acting all depressed and watching videos that aren't even sad. Then start reposting some of them. Like I'll come across a video of a father and daughter and be like, ha, that could be me and my dad if he didn't leave. Then I'll come across one of those top 10 funniest moments on the Kevin Lang Show and I'm there cracking up, trying to hold in my laugh so I don't wake anyone up. Then suddenly I come across one of those gym motivation videos yelling at me through the screen, you want to be known as lazy your whole life and I'll be taking it serious, thinking, hell no. Then they say drop down and do 10 push UPS. I do, but my noodle alarms are so weak, I can't even do one. So the walk of shame, climbing back in my bed. But no, the adrenaline is still there. I set an alarm at 6:00am to go for a run. So then I decide to go sleep. Suddenly, I'm hit with the most embarrassing memories flooding my head. Every move shifts to a different One, my brain is practically telling me, ha, remember this, you fucking loser. Eventually, I fall asleep, then wake up from the fuck ass alarm I set and be like, who the heck did I think I was? And go back to sleep. So moral of the story, just go to bed early before the 5 stages of grief hit you. More stories coming soon.

You know that one guy at every party? The one who thinks he's God's gift to alcohol and women? The guy who says things like, I mix better than I date, and if you can't handle a little fun, go home? Yeah, that guy. For me, that guy had a name. Mason. Mason was the kind of guy who wore sunglasses indoors and took shirtless mirror pics like it was a civic duty. He thought spiking people's drinks was hilarious. Just a little joke, bro, he'd say. Like slipping something into someone's drink was on par with drawing a mustache on a passed out friend. Spoiler alert it's not. I found out the hard way. It was during our friend Bailey's New Year's party. Good people, decent music, enough food to soak up the bad decisions. I grabbed a drink off the kitchen island. Non alcoholic cause I was the designated driver. Took a few sips. It tasted a little weird. Like if regret had a flavor. I figured maybe the soda was flat. Ten minutes later, the room started spinning like it was trying to detach from earth. I barely made it to the bathroom before my legs went full Jello. My heart was racing in crawling, and I was suddenly having a deep personal conversation with the floor tiles. Bailey found me an hour later, curled up like a shrimp in her tub. She called an Ambulance. Thank god. Turns out Mason had decided to spice up the party by adding something to my drink. Something prescription based. Something not meant for conscious humans. He thought it was funny. Dude, you should have seen your face, he said, laughing when I confronted him. Relax. I gave you the light stuff. Ah, yes. Just a sprinkle of involuntary coma. How festive. I wanted to punch him, but I'm not stupid. People forget bruises, but they don't forget fear. Especially the kind that seeps in drop by drop. So I made a decision. Mason was going to become terrified of liquids. All of them. The plan took finesse. I couldn't just scream revenge and run at him with a water balloon. This had to feel like karma was slowly dripping down his neck. And it started with coffee. I knew Mason's routine. Every morning, same cafe, same order. Iced triple espresso with oat milk, vanilla, two pumps of ego. So I applied for a job at that cafe. Not because I needed it, but because revenge requires commitment. After three weeks of being the overly eager new guy, I got barista duty. Mason walked in. I greeted him with my best you probably don't remember drugging me smile. He didn't recognize me. Perfect. I made his drink. Nothing in it yet, but after handing it to him, I leaned over and said, we've had a few complaints about mold in the oatmeal. Let's

So I gave them exactly what they asked for. I've been renting this house since 1985. The inside was covered in hand painted murals. I'd spent decades creating Disney characters, fairy tales, elaborate scenes on every wall. I was an art teacher and this house was my masterpiece. The original landlord always promised I'd eventually own it. We had a handshake agreement about the murals as long as they stayed inside, no problem. He passed away before anything was made official. His son inherited the property and came to inspect it with his teenage daughter. She fell in love with my artwork immediately. Dad, this is like living inside a storybook, she gushed, taking photos of every wall. That's when he delivered the news. We're not renewing your lease. My daughter wants this house, but I've been here almost 40 years without a lease. Your month to month. We need you out in 30 days. What about all my artwork? He smiled. That's actually perfect. We want the house exactly as it is for my daughter. Don't change anything. I was devastated but found a place out of state with a proper art studio. My contractor friend offered to help restore the house to move in condition for free since he wanted practice with his new paint sprayer. I'll get it ready for the new owners, he said. Make it perfect for them. The landlord's Son was thrilled. That's so generous. We appreciate you leaving everything pristine. Moving week, we emptied all my furniture into storage. Week 2, my friend started preparing the house. He sanded every single wall. All my murals, Cinderella's Ballroom, Peter Pan's Neverland Beauty and the Beast library, gone. Just colored blotches on bare walls. Then came the primer. His industrial sprayer covered everything in thick white kills. Every trace of artwork disappeared under industrial grade cover.

None. I just feel like he's a completely different person than who I thought he was. Did he say something like horrible to you? No, it's just I don't respect him and the things that he contributes to. And, you know, I, I just don't respect him as a human being, the things that he contributes to. Um, I actually got there a lot sooner than he did. So I had unpacked my bike and I kind of met him at the beginning of the trail. So, you know, we had our date and when we got back, I noticed he drove this enormous SUV. I'm still waiting for a problem.

Hi. Can I speak to Lisa, please? This is her. Hey, Lisa. How are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Um, hello. Hello. I'm calling you today because one of our listeners emailed us and asked us to get you on the phone. Really? Mm hmm. It's a segment that we do on our show called The 2nd Date Update. It's where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up blowing them off, they email us and ask us to get that person on the phone and ask why. So you recently went out on a date with somebody that listens to our show. Um, alright. His name is George. I think you would remember going on a date with George because you also invited him to your birthday party. Oh, yes, I did. Sounds like regret in your voice right there. Yeah. You have a second to talk to us about George? Yeah, I have a second. Um, fortunately, yeah. So he told us about how you guys met and he went to your birthday party. He thought everything went great. And then you sent him a text message saying you didn't want to talk to him anymore. Did he do something wrong? What? You know what? He was great with my friends, but the reactions at the end of the night were just not what I expected. Did your friends not like him? They thought it was Kind of a douche or something. It wasn't my friends who reacted about him. It was, it was my parents. Oh, oh, your parents didn't like him? Yeah. Like really? Didn't like them at all. Really? Are they like really strict parents? No, they're not really overprotected. That's why it's weird that they didn't like this person. What did they say to you? Well, they told me he asked questions and they told me, he asked my mom, how many grandkids do you want? What? Yes. Was he joking? My mom said, I don't know. She didn't make it seem like he was joking. Was it in context, though, about something they were talking about? How long was he talking to your parents? He was talking them for a long time. I think he was trying to impress them or something. But he was with them for a while before I got married. My mom would not really bring up grandkids, but some of them are like, oh, my god, I can't wait till she finally gets married. Give me some grandkids. No, no, that's not my mom at all. But to add that after like the first time meeting them, and especially we just went to coffee once, like we've only been on one date. So did she get the feeling, I mean, cause I could see him talking to her, just be like, hey, do you want grandkids someday? That's cool. Yeah. But if he's like, how many Grandkids you want? Cause I'm about to do work. I'm getting ready to do work tonight with how she felt about it. Yes, that's okay. Exactly how I talk to her. But don't you think, I mean, one question like that, like it was enough to write him off. No, it was the second question that he asked my parents. The second, what else, what else did he ask your parents other than if they want grandkids? He, he asked my dad for permission to marry me. Shut up. That is not true. He had to have been joking. There's no way he did. He, he had to have been joking, though. No, my dad said he was serious. Are you sure your dad's reading it correctly? I can't imagine a guy being out, technically your second date at your birthday party and then asking your father for permission to marry you. I wish it had to happen, but it did. And is that why you sent him a text saying, I don't want to talk to you anymore? Yeah. Okay. By the way, I completely support that. If that, that's what I'd love to know if he was actually joking, though, wouldn't you? No, I, I mean, I trust my parents. Alright. Well, I'd like to ask him, and he's actually on the other line listening right now, so we can do that. Are you serious? Yes, I am. Uh, first of all, this is being blown way out. Of proportion. Way out of proportion. I was having an adult conversation with some adults about adult things. I don't know what to say right now. This whole situation is just confusing. Did you. It's really confusing to me, too, George. Did you ask her father if you could marry her? It was in the context of a fun conversation. And I was like, you know, I was just like, hey, man.

Cause you actually went out on a date with them and now you're not calling her back. I'm not. Who, who am I not calling back? Her name is Rachel. And she said that you guys met at a house party and then went out to dinner, but the dinner had to be cut short because of a missing cat. Oh, the cat. It's the, wait, it's that hard to remember the girl that you were puking off the balcony with? Rachel. Yeah. So you remember Rachel? Yes. Did you like Rachel? Uh, yeah. Uh, I liked Rachel.

So you've also been counting how many days it's been since you haven't called her back? Uh, well, I've, uh, I kept track of it cause I've, uh, that's how long I've been in the hospital. What? What? Oh my God. Are you currently in the hospital right now? No, no, I just, I, um, I just got out yesterday. Oh my God. Is that why it sounds like you're on drugs right now? Uh, I'm a little bit on some painkillers and stuff. Whoa, whoa. Are you okay? What happened? Yeah. Um, wow, that was, it was such a crazy night. Um, so her cat was missing. Uh huh. And she was, I remember she was really distraught. So I felt bad and she like got out of the car. So I drove around the corner and then I decided to get out of the car to maybe look, look for the cat. Uh huh. I thought maybe the cat was like outside or around the area. Yeah. So I was looking for her cat and it was really dark and I couldn't really see that well and then a car came and hit me. What? You got hit by a car? Oh my God. Yeah, yeah. I got like a broken arm and I got a couple broken ribs. Oh my God. You're lucky that that's it, dude. Yeah, I've been in the hospital cause that happened. So you were gonna call her back, but obviously you've had Other things going on right now. Yeah. Um, it's just, it's just been nuts dealing with all this stuff. Yeah. Oh, she knows that. I'm so glad you're okay. Yeah. We talked to her. It sounds like she doesn't have any idea that you got hit by a car looking for a cat. I, uh, I don't, I don't, I don't know. I've been in the hospital. I, I don't know what she knows. Oh, my God. I would feel so bad if I was Rachel. It was a, I played myself forever. Very nice of you to try to find her cat, though.

Have you recently gone out on a date with a girl named Carol who's also divorced? What's going on here? Oh, god. Sorry, man. I don't know how much you know about our show, but have you ever heard a second date update? No. No. Okay. Well, what that is is it's where if you go out on a date with someone and then not call them back after they email us to see if we can get you on the phone and ask why. So Carol actually emailed us about you and she told us how you hired her to decorate your place and then you ended up taking her out for dinner and now you're not calling her back. Yeah, I mean, but you know, I don't feel like I should go into all that on the radio. Well, she actually kind of wants you to. Why? Because she liked you and she wants to know what the reason is. Did she do something wrong on the date? I mean, it was just, it was kind of strange and I don't know, probably embarrassing for her. So I really don't want to get into it. Oh, well, if you're saying that it's something that's gonna embarrass her, she's prepared to be embarrassed. I mean, she's the one that emailed us to do this. Segment. So yeah, but I mean, she told me I don't know if she would want me telling everybody who's listening to this. Well, that's kind of the deal when you do this. We tell you beforehand like you have to be willing to air whatever dirty laundry it is and you have to be willing to hear something that might be embarrassing. So she knows she's totally clueless. Uh, okay. All right. Well, yeah, I don't know how much she like told you about the date, but you know, we, we were talking and both of us had been divorced. So we were just talking about some of our experiences with that and uh, apparently she's had four different husbands. Whoa. Oh, that's a lot. She only, it's a lot. Yeah. Well, you know, I mean, she only told us about one divorce or at least made it sound like she only had one divorce. Yeah. Oh, no, no, no, no. Um, it's really, uh, okay. So yes, she has said she had four. Um, two of them were actually divorces. Okay. One of them, I mean, I swear this is how I remember it. She said that she doesn't actually know where he is. He's wait, he's missing like she, the words she actually used were missing in action and then like laughed about it. So wait, it's not, it wasn't like a legit military thing. I don't think so. I mean, she, if it was a military Thing. I don't think she would have laughed. I mean, she laughed like she didn't know where he is and she laughed about it. So isn't she like technically still married to him? I don't. I honestly, I didn't want to ask much beyond that. Um, but she had said that she had been married four times. So, you know, I was like, well, what about the last one? And she told me that he died. Did she laugh about that, too, or was that a sad moment for her? Yeah. No, she, she offered that. And, you know, so I was trying to be sympathetic. And she was sort of cavalier about that, too. She said that apparently they were in the Caribbean and he, he fell off of a hoverboard. What? Oh, my God. That is a crazy story. No, she did not kill these guys. Why are you thinking that? That is the most ridiculous conclusion.

My sister Emma had been planning her wedding for two years, and I was supposed to be her maid of honor. She kept dropping hints about how all the bridesmaids needed to look cohesive in the photos and how important it was for everyone to put their best foot forward for her big day. Look, I'm not stupid. I knew what she was getting at. I gained about 40 pounds over the past few years since I started working from home. Emma never said it directly, but every time we talked about the wedding, she'd mention some diet she saw on Instagram or ask if I was getting ready for the wedding season. The breaking point came three months before the wedding when we went dress shopping. I tried on the bridesmaid dress in my size, and Emma just stared at me in the mirror with this tight smile. She asked if maybe we should size up for comfort and then suggested I might wanna start doing some pre wedding prep with her. That weekend, she texted me a link to some fitness app and said, thought this might help with your confidence for the big day. I screenshot that text and sent it to my boyfriend Tyler, who said she was being a total bitch. I decided I'd show her. I downloaded my Fitness Pal that night and started tracking everything. I cut out all the late night snacking, stopped getting coffee, With extra syrup and started walking to the grocery store instead of driving. I wasn't trying to do anything extreme. I just wanted to lose enough weight that Emma couldn't make her little comments anymore. The first month, I lost 12 pounds. Emma noticed right away when we met for brunch and kept asking what I was doing differently. I told her I was just eating better, and she got this weird look on her face like she didn't expect me to actually do anything about it. By month two, I was down 25 pounds and feeling amazing. I bought new jeans that actually fit.

Okay. Is this like he has a pretty crazy search history that includes a kinky fetish type thing or is it worse? No, it's worse. Um, so I was looking at his iPad because it's connected to his phone and I had to reset our home like security system and he keeps the code on there and his note section. So I was getting the code and I noticed one of the sections in his note that was called Gift Ideas. So I was like, hmm, maybe I'll take a quick peek see if he picked up on the many hints that I've been leaving. Um, so wait, so wait. So you snoop so you're a Christmas gift snooper then for shame. Yeah, I know I'm a bad person but, uh, anyway, I was looking and I see some, some of the stuff he was thinking about getting the family and friends and then I see a name staff and I'm like, hmm, I don't know a staff. Um, and I see he was planning on getting her um, diamond stud earrings. So, oh, now I'm like who, who the heck is this staff person? So to your knowledge he doesn't have like a cousin staff or a sibling? It's not his mom's name or his grandma. No, no staff that I can think of at all. And I'm like, well, maybe this is Just a coworker or a good friend. But still like, is it even okay for a married man to buy be buying diamond earrings for a friend or a co worker? I mean, I mean, it kind of depends. So right. I mean, if it's somebody maybe they're retiring after many years of working with him or are the diamonds like teeny tiny cheapos? Listen, but even if they are, I don't know if a married man has any business buying diamond earrings for another woman for any reason. Has he ever bought you diamond earrings? Yeah, but many, many years ago. Okay, but see, he took care of his wife first then I don't know. I don't think there's any reason why a married man should be buying diamond earrings for another woman. See, that's exactly how I feel as well. So okay, what do you want us to do then Casey? I like to know who this staff person is and why he's buying her diamond earring. Okay. Well, I'm not sure if we can answer the second question, but we can definitely find out the more important one which who is this staff person and and I'm assuming we can call your husband. Yes, absolutely. Okay. And what is his name? I don't think you ever told us. It's John. John. Okay, so hang on a sec and then we'll get John's number from you and then we'll call him when we come back next. Hello. Hi. Can I speak to John, please? Can I ask who's calling? Sure. This is the Z Morning Zoo radio show on Z1 0, 4, Nick, Natalie and Shaggy. Is this John? It sure is. What's up, everybody? Not much. How are you this morning? I'm doing well. I'm doing real well, actually. Uh, you know, I feel a lot better if you're about to tell me I won something, though. Oh, yeah. Well, ha ha. I wish that was why you were calling. Actually, we've been doing something really special on our show this week called Sexy Secret Santa, and that's why we called you. Okay. So the way it works is if somebody's got like a special person in their lives and they're kind of like a secret, they call us and tell us to wish them a very sexy Christmas. Kinda lame, you know? I know. But listen, we got a call from Steph about you. I guess she said you were a very special person to her. So who is Steph?

Hi. Can I speak to Lisa, please? This is her. Hey, Lisa. How are you? This is Jubal from Brooke and Jubal in the morning. Um, hello. Hello. I'm calling you today because one of our listeners emailed us and asked us to get you on the phone. Really? Mm hmm. It's a segment that we do on our show called The 2nd Date Update. It's where if you go out on a date with somebody and then end up blowing them off, they email us and ask us to get that person on the phone and ask why. So you recently went out on a date with somebody that listens to our show. Um, alright. His name is George. I think you would remember going on a date with George because you also invited him to your birthday party. Oh, yes, I did. Sounds like regret in your voice right there. Yeah. You have a second to talk to us about George? Yeah, I have a second. Um, fortunately, yeah. So he told us about how you guys met and he went to your birthday party. He thought everything went great. And then you sent him a text message saying you didn't want to talk to him anymore. Did he do something wrong? What? You know what? He was great with my friends, but the reactions at the end of the night were just not what I expected. Did your friends not like him? I thought it was Kind of a douche or something. It wasn't my friends who reacted about him. It was, it was my parents. Oh. Oh, your parents didn't like him? Yeah. Like really? Didn't like them at all. Really? Are they like really strict parents? No, they're not really overprotective. That's why it's weird that they didn't like this person. What did they say to you? Well, they told me he asked questions and they told me, he asked my mom, how many grandkids do you want? What? Yes. Was he joking? My mom said, I don't know. She didn't make it seem like he was joking. Was it in context, though, about something they were talking about? How long was he talking to your parents? He was talking to them for a long time. I think he was trying to impress them or something. But he was with them for a while before I got married. My mom would not really bring up grandkids, but some of them are like, oh, my god, I can't wait till she finally gets married. Give me some grandkids. No, no, that's not my mom at all. But to add that after like the first time meeting them, and especially we just went to coffee once, like, we've only been on one date. So did she get the feeling, I mean, cause I could see him talking to her, just being like, hey, do you want grandkids someday? That's cool. Yeah. But if he's like, how Many grandkids you want? Cause I'm about to do work. I'm getting ready to do work tonight with how she felt about it. Yes, that's okay. Exactly how I talk to her. But don't you think, I mean, one question like that, like it was enough to write him off? No, it was the second question that he asked my parents. The second, what else, what else did he ask your parents other than if they want grandkids? He, he asked my dad for permission to marry me. Shut up. That is not true. He had to have been joking. There's no way he did. He, he had to have been joking, though. No, my dad said he was serious. Are you sure your dad's reading it correctly? I can't imagine a guy being out, technically your second date at your birthday party and then asking your father for permission to marry you. I wish it had to happen, but it did. And is that why you sent him a text saying, I don't want to talk to you anymore? Yeah. Okay. By the way, I completely support that. If that, I'd love to know if he was actually joking, though, wouldn't you? No, I, I mean, I trust my parents. Alright. Well, I'd like to ask him, and he's actually on the other line listening right now, so we can do that. Are you serious? Yes, I am. Uh, first of all, this is being blown way out of Proportion, way out of proportion. I was having an adult conversation with some adults about adult things. I don't know what to say right now. This whole situation is just confusing. Did you. It's really confusing to me, too, George. Did you ask her father if you could marry her? It was in the context of a fun conversation.

I was the first person in my family to go to college. My dad worked construction, my mom cleaned houses, and my little brother Jake gave up his bedroom so I could have a quiet space to study. When I got my acceptance letter to State University, I ran through the house screaming that I got a full scholarship. I didn't. I got partial aid that covered about 60%. The rest would be $28,000. My first year alone. Stood in the financial aid office staring at those numbers, knowing my parents would take out loans they couldn't afford, or call every distant relative begging for help. They'd already sacrificed so much. I walked to the student loan office down the hall and signed papers for a private loan. I told myself I'd pay it back on my own after graduation. Easy. The first payment came due six months later, while I was still in school. $240 a month. I got a job shelving books at the campus library for $8 an hour, and picked up tutoring sessions for kids who struggled with math. Between classes, I'd run to work. Between work, I tutor until midnight. My parents called every Sunday asking how my scholarship was going. I told them it was great. My mom would cry happy tears, talking about how proud she was that her smart daughter got everything paid for. Every month I made that payment. Sometimes I'd eat nothing but ramen. Noodles for three weeks straight. When my roommates went out for pizza, I'd say I wasn't hungry. When they asked why I worked so many hours with a full ride, I joked that I was saving up for something special. By graduation, the debt had grown to $53,000. Interest kept piling on top of interest. I still said nothing. I got a job in marketing in Chicago and moved to the smallest studio apartment I could find. It it was basically a closet with a hot plate, but rent was only 800 a month. My parents visited once and asked why I lived somewhere so tiny when I made decent money. I told them I was being responsible and saving for a house. Really? I was drowning. Every single month I transfer money to that loan. I walked 40 minutes to work instead of taking the bus. I bought clothes from thrift stores and told people I was into vintage fashion. I never went to movies or bars. When co workers invited me out, I'd make excuses about being tired or having plans. My friends thought I was incredibly disciplined. They joke about my monk like lifestyle and ask for budgeting advice. If only they knew I was living on peanut butter sandwiches and splitting single meals into two days of food. The worst part was lying to my family. When Jake started applying to colleges, he'd call asking for advice about scholarships. I'd help him with applications while knowing His chances were slim. When my parents mentioned how expensive college was getting, I'd nod and agree while making another payment on my secret debt. Five years passed.

Uh, I don't really want to, but she kind of wants an explanation. Dude. She was she, we talked to her right? She had great things to say about you. She said it was like the best date of her life. Yeah, she was really complimentary. That's really nice. I mean, we had a lot of fun. It was a fun time. So you liked it? So she was fun. Are you not attracted to her? Is that the issue? No, I would she's cute. I like her, but it's just not gonna work out. Okay. Well, why if she's cute and you had fun, that sounds awful. Is that a problem? You don't like that? No, I really like that. It's just she lied. She lied. Whoa. About what? Uh, actually, let me rephrase that. She wasn't 100% truthful with me. Okay. Okay. Who is on a first date? Let's be honest. Well, yeah, but I mean, this is kind of an important thing that she wasn't very truthful about. What was it? Well, she said her name was Stephanie on Tinder. Okay. Okay. And then when we met, it was revealed that her name is summer. So she uses a different name on Tinder. Yeah. Well, No. 1, I don't know why someone would do that, but I, I can think of a lot of reasons. Maybe she's got a crazy ex or she doesn't want people to know or She just want her job to be able to search her on Tinder. Okay. I mean, nonetheless, I'd still wouldn't work out why? Why is that a big deal? Yeah. Well, yeah, our name is summer. Our name is summer. Okay. My last name is pants.

Yeah, I, I would love that. Well, I would not love that. It make me very uncomfortable knowing maybe people are making fun of her behind her back or something like that. Oh my God. You jumped so many steps by the way. Well, I know I'm going fast, but I'm looking for a long term relationship. So I'm not there to just mess around with people. And so, so you're looking for a forever pants. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hey, don't get smarty pants and you okay. You don't feel like somebody with the name Summer Pants would be the person that you want to be around all the time. No, it's just a little too awkward. Okay. But you are so many assumptions here. One that she would even take your name when you got married. Like a lot of women keep their last name and that's fine. No, I come kind of from a more traditional point of view. So you want whoever you marry To take your last name. Yeah, I do. Even though it's an awkward life to live with the last name pants. I know it is. I'm living it. But you're Daniel Pants and you don't think summer pants would be a good partner for you? No, I just couldn't do that to her. Okay. Well, and that's it. That's the only reason. That is the biggest reason. Yes. That is so ridiculous to me. Yes. You could be missing out on the love of your life because of it. Silly thing and years of great jokes. Yeah. That's a problem for me. I don't want my wife's name to be a joke. I just want us to be a happy family of pants. See, now you're making jokes about your own last name, so you can't really judge. No, I'm allowed to. Okay. You're allowed to. Well, Daniel, I do have to let you know that summer is on the phone listening right now and she wants to talk to you. What? Yeah.

No problem. Okay. I love it. Love it. Any girl with brown hair? Save the number. Yeah, nice girl with brown hair. If you're just tuning in, Adam is about to make a very awkward phone call. He wants to call a girl that he's gone on two dates with. What's her name by the way? I didn't get that from you. Tony. Tony. Okay, so he and Tony have been on two dates and he's about to call her and ask her if she will marry him. Oh my god. I mean, usually that is something romantic that we set up. This is so far from romance. This is like anti romantic, right? The reason that he needs to do it is his grandmother is very wealthy and she put in her will that he has to marry someone while she's still around and be married for a year and he'll get over $1 million. The grandmother even had like a checklist of what this person must be like. So he went out on a date with a girl who matches that criteria and he wants to call her and see if she'll marry him so that they can both get paid. It's so crazy when you say it. I mean, but why her? Why not just set up some advertisement? Somewhere it explains all the rules and details of this and literally just do a business deal with somebody. Oh, I mean, yeah, I could do that but I actually think I like this girl and I think that you know, maybe I do see a future I just have to speed things up a little bit. I think you should include those words in your proposal. Yeah, they're really romantic. I think so. Alright, well, I'm gonna dial her phone number and let you make your phone call. Good luck. Thank you. Hello. Hey, Tony, it's Adam. Oh, hey, how's it going? Good. Is this a good time to talk? Yeah, I can talk. So how's your day? You're having a good day today? Yeah, I'm having a great day. Thanks for asking. How, how's your day going? So good, great day. Really good day. Um, what are you doing tonight? I was just gonna do hot yoga and then go home. Oh my God. I love how you're doing nothing. I haven't been doing it for a while but whenever I do it it's great. Um, I'm sorry I'm being awkward. It's because there's something I want to talk to you about and I'm, I feel like I'm so awkward right now over it. Oh, uh, what's going on? Um, so like, you know, we've been on a couple dates and it's been great right? Really good time. Yeah, I mean, I feel like We hit it off pretty well. Um, so I know it's maybe like doing this over the phone is kind of weird, but I guess that what I was kind of curious was like, do you, have you ever thought about like marriage? Uh, what, what, what are you asking me? What about like, I mean, like, do you see yourself getting married at any point? Uh, like ever or an either or? I mean, like sooner than later, let's say. Oh man, why are you asking me about that? Um, I know this is gonna sound so crazy and I know it's probably gonna catch you way off guard and I don't even know what I'm doing, but I, oh my God. Are you going to ask me to marry you? Is that what this is? Um, yeah, I guess I am. Oh my God. You sucked it too. What? Oh my God. This is it. This is, wait, what? Oh my, yes, yeah, yes. Oh my God. I have to call my friends, my mother, my grandmother. Oh my God. This is amazing. This is amazing. Oh my gosh. What? Yeah, huh? What? What? What? Um, you're excited? Yes, yes, I'm excited. I knew there was a connection, just like I knew you liked me, but you like really?

I didn't know guys will just stand in the shower for 10 minutes doing nothing, no water running, just standing there like they're waiting for a download to finish. The first time I walked in on it, I thought something was wrong. He looked at me all calm and said, I'm just mentally preparing. I've never looked at showers the same way. 2. I found out men treat fridges like treasure hunts. He'll open it five times in a row, stare like something new is going to spawn, sigh dramatically, and then eat plain cheese straight from the block. I once asked why he keeps checking. He said, in case a snack magically appears. Three, I didn't know guys hum to themselves during the most random tasks. My boyfriend will be cleaning the sink, humming what sounds like boss battle music, then suddenly switch to singing about how this sponge is my sword. I caught it on video once and he begged me not to post it. 4. They'll wear the same hoodie for a month straight like it's a second skin. When I suggested washing it, he looked genuinely confused and said, but it still smells like me, so it's fine. 5. They will absolutely keep random screws or wires in a just in case drawer. I asked why. He said, because you never know when you'll need this. It was a bent nail. 6, 10. They make sound effects for everything, opening jars, throwing socks in the laundry, even getting up from the couch. Suddenly he's making rocket launch noises. 7, they'll stand in front of the mirror flexing, not realizing you can see them. The second they notice, they pretend they were checking their posture. 8, they'll eat an entire meal over the sink just to save dishes. And apparently that's normal to them. 9, they'll absolutely risk breaking a limb before making two trips from the car, groceries stacked to their chin, wobbling like a Jenga tower, but proud. 10, they can sit in total silence for an hour staring at the wall. And when you ask what they're thinking about, they say nothing. And somehow they really mean nothing.

Like something in my brain goes wow, yes, it's a good idea to rearrange my room right now. But I swear I hit all the phases. I'll be happy watching TikTok, chilling, then boom, it hits 2:00am and a wave of sadness comes. I'll start crying, acting all depressed, and watching videos that aren't even sad. Then start reposting some of them. Like I'll come across a video of a father and daughter and be like huh, that could be me and my dad if he didn't leave. Then I'll come across one of those top 10 funniest moments on the Kevin Lang Show and I'm there cracking up trying to hold in my laugh so I don't wake anyone up. Then suddenly I come across one of those gym motivation videos yelling at me through the screen you want to be known as lazy your whole life? And I'll be taking it serious, thinking hell no. Then they say drop down and do 10 push UPS. I do, but my noodle alarms are so weak I can't even do one. So the walk of shame. Climbing back in my bed. But no, the adrenaline is still there. I set an alarm at 6 am to go for a run, so then I decide to go sleep. Suddenly I'm hit with the most embarrassing memories flooding my head. Every move shifts to a Different one. My brain is practically telling me, ha! Remember this, you fucking loser? Eventually, I fall asleep, then wake up from the fuck ass alarm I set and be like, who the heck did I think I was? And go back to sleep. So, moral of the story, just go to bed early before the five stages of grief hit you. More stories coming soon.

My mom would go through my backpack every single day when I got home from school, checking my homework like I was in third grade. She'd read my text messages whenever she felt like it, and if I complained, she'd take my phone away for a week. My dad wasn't much better. He had this rule where I couldn't leave the house after six PM, even on weekends. If I wanted to hang out with friends, I had to give them a full essay about where I was going, who would be there, and when I'd be back. The final straw was when they installed one of those tracking apps on my phone without telling me. I only found out because my friend Jake mentioned seeing my location pop up when he was trying to text me. I confronted them about it that night, and my mom just shrugged and said it was for my safety. My dad backed her up, saying as long as I lived under their roof, I followed their rules. Been working at this pizza place since I turned 16, saving up every paycheck except for what I needed for gas and lunch money. By the time I graduated high school, I had almost $4,000 saved up. I started looking at apartments online during my lunch breaks, telling myself I was just browsing. But the More I thought about it, the more I realized I could actually do this. Found this tiny studio apartment about 20 minutes from my job. The rent was only 600 a month, and the landlord said if I could prove I had a steady income and pay first month plus deposit, he'd rent to me. I went to look at it on a day my parents thought I was at work. It was small and kind of dingy, but it was mine. I filled out the application that same day. Two weeks later, he called and said I was approved. I could move in the following weekend. That's when it hit me that I was actually doing this. I felt sick to my stomach, but also kind of excited. I started slowly moving my stuff out. Every day after work, I'd grab a backpack full of clothes or books and stash them in my car. Told my parents I was staying late to help close the restaurant, which wasn't totally a lie, since I was picking up extra shifts to make sure I could afford everything. The hardest part was getting my bigger stuff out. I waited until they went to my aunt's house for Sunday dinner, something I'd gotten out of by saying I had to work. I loaded up my car with my dresser, my desk, and my TV. Left most of the furniture since it wasn't really mine anyway, but I took the stuff that mattered. I Left them a note on the kitchen counter. I kept it simple. Told them I'd moved out, that I was safe, and that I'd call them in a few days when I was settled. I said I needed space to figure out who I was as an adult and that I hoped they'd understand eventually. I left my house key next to the note. My phone started blowing up around 8 that night. Missed calls, texts, voicemails. My mom was crying, and half of them my dad was yelling in the others. They wanted to know where I was, if I was okay, why I didn't talk to them first. They said they'd always supported me and couldn't understand why I do this to them. Turn my phone off and didn't turn it back on until the next morning. I had 37 missed calls and way too many texts to read through. I called them back and told them I was fine. Gave them my address and said they could come see my place if they wanted. My mom showed up.

She tap her cane on the floor and smile like she just revealed state secrets. This turned my entire extended family into vultures. My Aunt Rachel drove three hours every Tuesday just to vacuum Grandma's living room. Uncle Steve called twice daily asking about her arthritis. My cousin Jennifer moved back from California and started doing Grandma's grocery shopping. They all hated each other but pretended to be saints around her. Meanwhile, I was banned from inheritance discussion. I liked guys and chicken nuggets, and grandma made it crystal clear that sinners don't deserve family money. She'd change the subject whenever I entered rooms. My cousins would smirk and whisper about how I'd be working at McDonald's while they lived in luxury. But here's what none of them knew. I actually loved spending time with grandma. Not for money. She'd already told me I wasn't getting any, but because she was genuinely funny. When she wasn't performing for the Inheritance Hunters, while they argued over who deserved what, I'd sneak over on Wednesday nights to watch old movies and eat ice cream. Grandma would relax completely. When it was just us, she'd tell dinosaurs jokes from the two thousand BC and complain about how fake everyone was being. She even started Asking about my boyfriend and seemed genuinely interested in our relationship. Never mentioned these visits to anyone because I knew they'd think I was scheming. After she passed last year, the whole family gathered for the will reading. Rachel brought a calculator. Steve wore his funeral suit from 1995. Jennifer had already started planning her European vacation. They were practically drooling as the lawyer opened the envelope.

He blamed it all on his ex. Natalia was psychotic, Steve said. Unpacking my boxes in his apartment. I just moved into his place after a year of dating. She'd bottle everything up, never tell me what bothered her, then explode with these lists of complaints she'd been secretly harboring for months. His hands shook. I need complete transparency. If something bothers you, tell me right away. This came out of nowhere. He'd never mentioned any of this in our entire year of dating. I had to ask. Total partnership. We tackle every problem as it comes at us. The pain in his voice was real. This woman had clearly traumatized him. Whatever you need, I said, and I meant it. If we were going to tackle problems together, we needed to see what those problems were right away. I created a shared Google calendar so we both know each other's schedules. Started a household expense spreadsheet we could both access. Even put up a cute whiteboard in the kitchen for reminders and love notes. But that's when things started getting strange. I'd written, Steve, tomorrow is trash day on the whiteboard. His whole body tensed. Why are you leaving me instructions? You said immediate transparency about household issues. The trash needs to go out. So I'm telling you, Natalia used to do this. Leave. Passive aggressive Notes everywhere. It's not passive aggressive. You asked me to communicate openly about problems instead of bottling them up. He never wrote anything on the whiteboard. After a month, I added a simple cleaning chart to track our household contributions. Nothing fancy, just making visible who did what. Steve's column remained empty week after week. This is excessive. Said grabbing a beer while deliberately not looking at the chart. I don't need to document every little thing I do. But you wanted everything transparent. No secrets. Not like this. This feels like surveillance. I didn't notice the pattern until I was updating our expense sheet one night. Every cleaning product, me. Every household essential, me. Toilet paper, paper towels, dish soap. All me. Steve's contributions, rent and beer. Nothing else. The whiteboard evolved from gentle reminders to increasingly desperately, please, please take out trash. Then trash is overflowing. Then seriously, trash. It was three beers deep, scrolling on his phone while I scrubbed dishes. He left for days. Oh, great, he muttered. Natalia got promoted to partner at her firm. Of course she did. He took another swig. Probably stepped on everyone to get there. Always was ruthless. After he passed out that night, curiosity got me. I found her Instagram through an old tagged photo. My stomach dropped. Natalia was gorgeous. A successful lawyer, according to her bio, living in a stunning downtown loft with Florida ceiling windows. Her latest post showed a man installing shelving and what looks Like a pristine garage. His shirt off, drill in hand. Caption Saturday. He fixed the sink, built shelves, and cleaned up after. I didn't know men like this existed. That Instagram post haunted me for weeks. I kept cleaning, kept tracking, kept hope Steve would step up. He didn't. Three months in, I was deep cleaning our bathroom because black mold had started creeping up the shower tiles, and Steve claimed he didn't see it. The sponge slipped from my hand and fell behind all the cleaning bottle under the sink. I had to lean in completely shoulder deep in the cabinet, feeling around in the dark, my fingers found the sponge. Then something else. A piece of paper stuck to the cabinet wall. Dear whoever is dating Steve, now you're cleaning under his sink, which means nothing has changed. He still doesn't clean, still doesn't listen. Still makes you feel like you're asking too much. You're not asking too much. You're asking for the bare minimum. He won't give it to you. Sincerely, Natalia. My hands shook. This note had been here for three years in the apartment Steve had lived in since before Natalia left, sitting exactly where she left it. Because he had never, not once, cleaned behind these bottles. Complete transparency, right? I walked straight to the living room where Steve was gaming and showed him the note. Face went white. That's. That's psychotic. This note has been here for three years, Steve. You've never cleaned Under that sink. You're really going to believe her? You're just as crazy as she was. I pulled up our shared spreadsheet. Let's practice that transparency you wanted. I've done 80

But the next day, the CEO asked, why did you let him go? Didn't you see the contract? I'm Gabriel, 34, working as a project coordinator at Data Flow Solutions, a growing tech startup. The CEO's son, Austin, manages our international partnerships. And honestly, he's always been intimidated by me since I started six months ago. Austin's one of those guys who got his position through nepotism, but tries to act like he earned it. He's constantly trying to prove himself by micromanaging everyone, especially me. I think he sees me as a threat because I actually know what I'm doing. Last Tuesday, we had this massive client call with Yamamoto Industries, a Japanese company worth potential, actually 12 million in revenue. This wasn't just any deal. It was the biggest contract our company had ever pursued. The call started at 2 p m. Austin was leading the presentation, trying to explain our software capabilities through this clunky translator app on his phone. I could see the confusion on the Japanese executives faces through the video call. They kept asking clarifying questions in broken English, and Austin kept getting more flustered. So our platform enables. Austin kept pausing to type into his translator. Data synchronization across multiple. Hold on. The Japanese team was exchanging glances, really losing patience. I was sitting in the corner just watching this disaster unfold. I could understand every word they were saying in Japanese. They were talking among themselves, saying Things like this is unprofessional, and maybe we should reconsider this part partnership. But I stayed quiet. Austin had specifically told me before the call that I was only there to take notes and learn and shouldn't interrupt under any circumstances. After 30 excruciating minutes, the Japanese team politely ended the call, saying they needed to reassess their options. Austin's face was red with embarrassment and anger. The moment the call ended, Austin exploded. You just sat there doing absolutely nothing! You're completely useless! Screamed. I'm busting my ass trying to save this deal, and you're just sitting there like a statue! I tried to speak up, Austin, if you'd let me. No excuses. You never contribute to any of our international deals. I'm done with you, Gabriel. Pack your desk right now. You're fired. I didn't argue. Just grabbed my stuff from my desk, packed my personal items into a cardboard box, and walked out. The next morning, I was having coffee at home when my phone rang. It was the CEO. Gabriel, this is Richard. Can you come in today? We need to talk urgently. I walked into Richard's corner office to find Austin sitting there looking confused and slightly annoyed. The CEO had our client contracts spread across his desk, along with legal documents and compliance certificates. Gabriel, please sit down, Richard said. Austin, can you tell me again exactly why you fired Gabriel yesterday? Austin straightened up. Dad, Gabriel doesn't contribute anything to our international client. Relationships. During yesterday's crucial call with the Japanese company, he just sat there doing nothing while I handled every

After years of fertility treatments, I was finally pregnant, and my husband and I were thrilled. I've been thinking about baby names since I was 12 and had always known what I'd name my daughter. When I told my husband Ryan my choice over dinner, he stared at me for the longest time before saying, you're joking, right? I laughed because I thought he was teasing me about how long I'd been planning this, but his face stayed completely serious. He asked if I had a backup name, and I said no, because this was the only name I'd ever wanted for a daughter. Ryan rubbed his temples like he had a headache and said, well, if you're absolutely sure. But he looked fit, physically uncomfortable saying it. When I asked what was wrong with the name, he just shook his head and changed the subject. The next day, I told my mom over lunch, and she literally spit out her coffee. She started coughing, and when she finally caught her breath, she asked if Ryan and I were having problems. I said, no, everything was perfect. And she said, then why would you do that to your baby? I asked her what she meant, and she just kept shaking her head, saying she couldn't believe I was serious. She left the restaurant without finishing her meal. My sister had an even worse reaction. When I told her at our weekly coffee date, she Immediately pulled out her phone and started typing something, then showed me the screen asking if that's how I was planning to spell it. When I confirmed the spelling, she said oh my god, you're actually serious and started crying actual tears. She begged me to reconsider but wouldn't tell me why except to say the baby would never forgive me. I spent hours on the internet searching for anything problematic about the name. I checked if it meant something offensive in other languages or something, but nothing came up except normal stuff about it being a traditional name with Welsh origins. There was nothing that explained why everyone was acting like I'd chosen to name my baby something horrible. At my baby shower, my aunt asked what name we'd picked and the whole room went silent when I told them. My cousin actually gasped and my mother in law left the room. My best friend Stella pulled me aside and said please tell me you're pranking everyone because this isn't funny anymore. When I insisted I was serious, she said I needed professional help and left the party early. I posted in three different parenting forums asking if there was something wrong with the name and every single response assumed I was trolling. The moderators deleted my posts and banned me from two of the forums for creating drama with obvious rage bait. One person private messaged me saying if I was serious I should be reported. My co Workers found out when someone saw my list of baby names on my desk with only one name written on it. By lunch, everyone in the office was whispering and giving me strange looks. People stop talking when I walked by and someone had clearly been crying in the bathroom. Nobody would sit with me in the break room anymore. My boss called me into his office that afternoon and said several people had filed complaints about feeling uncomfortable. He said my joke about the baby name was creating a hostile work environment, and if I didn't stop telling people I was planning to use that name, he'd have to take disciplinary action. I tried to explain it wasn't a joke, but he cut me off and said no.

Don't contact me again. I replied. Fine. Then I canceled her credit cards and cut all financial support. Three days later, she was at my door, begging. My wife and I had been together for 10 years. Last Tuesday at 7 p m, I was making pasta while Alexis sat on her phone looking like she'd rather be anywhere else. Then, out of nowhere, I'm moving out tonight. I stopped stirring and looked at her. She wasn't even looking at me, still glued to her phone. Okay, I said. She finally looked up with surprise and annoyance. I wasn't causing a scene. That's it? Okay. You said you're moving out. What am I supposed to do, chain you up? I just need space. I'm not happy. Clearly, I said, nodding toward the half packed duffel bag by the kitchen island. This wasn't spur of the moment. She'd been planning this. I'm serious, Logan. I'll get my things later. Don't contact me. I'll contact you when I'm ready to talk about the rest. Fine, I said. She grabbed her bag first and keys to the car I paid off last year and walked out without a glance. Back door clicked. Silence. I sat there numb for 10 minutes, watching pasta water boil over. Then clarity hit me. She wanted out. Her decision. Fine. My turn to make decisions. I grabbed my laptop first, her supplementary Amex Platinum linked to my account. She loved that Card canceled. Reason? Card holder no longer authorized. Next. Next. Her visa, also supplementary. Gone. Then the automatic monthly transfer. A generous sum from my checking to her personal account. For self care, since her part time styling job didn't cover her expensive tastes. Canceled phone plan. Disabled international roaming for her inspiration trips. It wasn't anger, it was consequences. She wanted out. Fine. She was out all the way. She couldn't have the freedom and my financial safety net. I ate burnt pasta alone and slept surprisingly well. Three days of blessed quiet followed. I tidied up, ditched her clutter, watched my shows on the big TV. Then nine PM Thursday, insistent, knocking through the people. Alexis, flustered, hair messy, wearing a generic hoodie instead of designer clothes. Logan, she said breathlessly, when I open the door. Alexis, I replied calmly, like she was a neighbor asking for sugar. My card was declined. The Amex at dinner. It was so embarrassing, right? I said I canceled it. Her jaw dropped. You what? What? Hi. You moved out. Alexis said, don't contact me. That card was for my household. You're not part of it anymore. Your choice, but I needed that. I had dinner with Vincent. Vincent? Her friend, who apparently wasn't paying. Interesting. Sounds like a you and Vincent problem, I said, staying in the doorway. Logan, this isn't fair. I need money. My visa isn't working either. Also canceled. I can confirmed. And the transfer? The monthly transfer? Didn't come through, she wailed, tears starting. Correct. That was your allowance. As my wife, living in my home. Part of our life. You ended that arrangement. For a moment, I saw vulnerability flicker across her face. A decade gone with a cash

I said, thanks for letting me know. Then I kicked them both out of my house and sent their photos to everyone. Three days later, her pastor called me. I was booking an expensive cabin for Hannah, my fiance of five years. Marriage in six months, life finally on track. That's when she appeared in the doorway, looking like a ghost, pity and fear in her eyes. What's up? I asked, minimizing the booking website. She twisted her engagement ring. A nervous tick I used to find endearing. Ethan, I need to be honest with you. I messed up. I slept with someone. The words didn't register at first. No rage, no heat. Just found hollow silence. Okay. I heard myself say who? She flinched. It doesn't matter. It was a mistake. I love you. It matters to me. Hannah. Who was it? Big tears started. Theatrical drops that felt rehearsed. It won't happen again. We can get past this. Who? I repeated. The word was a stone. She choked on a sob. Terry. Terry. My best friend since 15. My best man. The same Terry on my couch after I'd given him a two thousand dollar loan two months prior. The pieces fused together with welding torch heat. I didn't yell. I just nodded. Thank for letting me know. I walked into the living room where Terry looked up from my TV, my chips in his lap. He saw my face. Then Hannah's tear streaked one and his smirk curdled. He knew. Terry, I said, the calmness scaring even me. Get your things. Five minutes. Ethan, buddy, let me explain. Nothing to explain. Four minutes. I opened the front door wide. You too, Hannah. Get what you need for tonight. Get out. This is my home, too, she wailed. It was, I corrected. This is my house. The Eid is in my name. I bought this place five years before I met you. You are a guest whose welcome has expired. As she passed me, she turned with indignation. You're throwing five years away over one little mistake? It wasn't little, Hannah, I said, looking from her to Terry cowering on the porch. And it wasn't one mistake. It was a thousand tiny ones that LED to this. She ripped the house key off her keychain and threw it onto the grass. I closed the door, locked it, and went to my computer. I'd installed security cameras after a missing package. One covered the living room. The camera I've been meaning to remove. I pulled the footage. There they were, on my couch. Casual intimacy. Worse than the act itself. I took screenshots, showing both faces, but not pornographic. The betrayal was the point. With cold purpose, I created a group chat. Our parents, siblings, wedding party, mutual friends. Important wedding update. I uploaded the pictures. The wedding is off. Hannah has been sleeping with my best man, Terry. In my House, please direct questions to them. I would appreciate space. I blocked every number and powered down my phone. The consequences came swiftly. Hannah's parents had put down $20,000, non refundable, on our venue. Her pastor demanded I reimburse them in Christian charity since I'd canceled the proceedings. I didn't cancel the wedding, pastor. I said a breach of contract canceled it. Their daughter's actions were the breach. The deposit is the price.

It all started when my parents lost their lease three months ago. Mom called me crying, saying they had nowhere to go. Just temporarily, she promised, until we find something. I felt guilty. I'd worked my behind off to buy this three bedroom house at 28. But they were family. So I cleared out my guest room and told them they could stay. First week was fine. They kept to themselves, helped with groceries, seemed grateful. Then it stretched to two weeks, then a month. Their temporary clothes started filling my closets. That's when my pregnant sister Jessica showed up with her deadbeat boyfriend, Eric. No warning, no asking permission. Just knocked on my door at 10 p m. With suitcases. We got evicted, Jessica announced, already pushing past me. We need somewhere to crash until the baby comes. I wanted to say no, but she was already seven months pregnant and looked exhausted. Eric just smirked behind her, carrying their stuff like he owned the place. So now my three bedroom house had five adults crammed into it. Jessica started complaining about the guest room being too small. She kept walking through my master bedroom, commenting on how much space I had. You don't really need this huge closet, she'd say, running her hands along my built in shelves. Two weeks later, I came home from work early and found them in my bedroom. Jessica was measuring The space. While Eric moved boxes into my walk in closet. What the hell are you doing? Jessica turned around casually, like I was interrupting her. We need more room for baby stuff. You can sleep on the couch until we figure something else out. The audacity hit me like a truck. My couch in my house that I paid for. Get your stuff out of my room right now! Eric stepped forward, just puffed out. Relax, man. We're family. We'll start paying rent when I find work. My mom emerged from the kitchen, trying to play peacekeeper. Honey, let's just talk about this. Jessica needs space for the baby, and you have the biggest room. Better off. No. This is my house. I decide who sleeps where. Jessica rolled her eyes. God, you're so selfish. Do you want your nephew born in a cramped guest room? I want my nephew born in his parents house, which isn't here. The silence was deafening. You could feel the shift in the room. I looked at all of them. You have 24 hours to find somewhere else to go. They laughed it off. Thought I was bluffing. Big mistake. The next morning, while they were all out apartment hunting, called a locksmith. Changed every single lock in the house. Front door, back door, garage. Cost me $400, but it was worth every penny. Then I went through the house systematically. Every piece of their stuff went into garbage bags. Clothes, toiletries. Eric's Gaming chair

Others kept the deposits. I didn't care anymore. Each cancellation felt like reclaiming my dignity. Then I remembered something crucial. The resort we were staying at. I put it on my credit card. My name was the primary on the reservation. She was just listed as a guest. I called the hotel. I need to cancel the rest of our stay immediately.

I got a call from the daycare saying my four year old daughter, Hazel, was burning up with fever. But when I went to pick her up, the daycare's director blocked me at the entrance. I'm sorry, Mister Fisher, but I cannot release Hazel to you. You're not authorized for emergency medical pickup. It took me a second to understand what she just said. What are you talking about? I'm literally her father. She's sick and she needs my help. Mrs. Patrick pulled out a thick binder labeled emergency protocols and started flipping the pages. Our insurance policy is very clear. In medical emergencies, children may only be released to the primary guardian. The primary listed is her mother. You are secondary. She showed me the form like it was federal law. I explained that her mother and I were divorced, I had weekday custody, her mother was two states away, and that Hazel needed my help ASAP. I understand, he said, not moving from the doorway. But our liability insurance is clear. No exceptions. The rules protect our license. Through the window, I saw Hazel curled up in the sick room, face bright red and clutching her stomach in pain. She saw me and reached out, crying, daddy. Mrs. Patrick yanked the blinds shut. You need her mother's approval before you can pick her up. I tried calling Hazel's mother three times, but it kept going to voicemail. So I started Arguing with the director again, begging her to let me in. 20 minutes passed, and this meathead woman still didn't understand what was at stake here. Through the door crack, I saw Hazel barely conscious with a red rash covering her neck. She's had a dangerous fever for an hour. Just let me take her to the hospital, I pleaded. Protocol is protocol, she replied. These rules exist for a reason. Enough is enough, I told myself. My daughter's life was in danger, and this woman blocking my path was obviously mentally ill. I pulled out my phone and dialed 9 1 1 right there in front of her. I need police assistance at this daycare. Mrs. Patrick went pale when she realized what I was doing. Sir, we're just following protocols, she said. Hammered, but I kept going. My 4 year old has a really high fever, and they won't even let her father take her to a doctor. The dispatcher heard a child's life was in danger and immediately labeled my case as a priority. Once the officers arrived, I showed them my custody papers, license, and Hazel's birth certificate. They looked at missus Patrick like she was dumb. This is his child. He has legal custody today. Release the child immediately. But our insurance protocol explicitly states. Your insurance protocol doesn't override law, the officer interrupted. Refusing to release a child to their legal guardian is custodial interference. Open the damn door! Missus Patrick fumbled for keys. Muttering about liability forms, they escorted me inside, where I finally scooped up Hazel. But she was in bad shape. Her skin was burning hot, her hair was matted with sweat, and that red rash was now covering her neck and chest. I rushed to the ER as fast as I could, but the doctor's expression turned grave when he examined Hazel's rash. This is scarlet fever. See the sandpaper texture? My heart felt like it had stopped. How serious is it, doctor? It's hard to say. If this had gone untreated another two to three hours. She paused. Scarlet fever causes rheumatic fever, permanent kidney damage, heart valve problems. You should be prepared. They rushed her away for emergency treatment. The next 12 hours were the longest of my life. Monitors beeping, nurses rushing in and out. Kidney function test

My brother Jake has this girlfriend named Becca who literally cannot stand not being the center of attention for five minutes. Every family dinner, every holiday, every gathering, she finds a way to make it about her. Last Thanksgiving, she announced she was pregnant right when my dad was about to carve the Turkey. Turns out she wasn't even pregnant. Just wanted to see everyone's reactions. So when I was planning my wedding to my fiance Ryan, I knew I had to do something about the Becca situation. This was going to be my one day. The one day that was supposed to be about me and Ryan starting our life together. I called Jake about three months before the wedding. Hey, so about the wedding I started. I need to ask you something kind of awkward. What's up? He said, and I could hear him eating cereal in the background. I really don't want Becca there. I know that sounds harsh, but she always makes everything about herself, and I just can't deal with that stress. On my wedding day, the line went quiet for, like, 10 seconds, and Jake exploded. Are you serious right now? You're uninviting my girlfriend from your wedding? I'm not uninviting her because she was never invited in the first place. The invitation was just for you. That's the same thing. We've been together for two years. She's basically family. I tried To explain that it wasn't personal, that I just wanted one drama free day. But Jake wasn't having it. He said if Becca couldn't come, then he wouldn't come either. I told him that was his choice. Think he changed his mind? He didn't. But here's where it gets crazy. The day of my wedding, I'm getting my makeup done in the bridal suite when my cousin Madison bursts in. Uh, you need to see this, he says, shoving her phone in my face. It's Becca's Instagram story. She's posted, like, 15 videos of herself getting all dressed up, doing her makeup, picking out jewelry. The caption on the last one says, can't wait to celebrate love today. With a bunch of heart emojis and the location tagged as our wedding venue. My heart drops. He's coming anyway. Madison nods. Jake's outside right now, arguing with your dad about it. He says he changed his mind and decided to bring her. I'm standing there in my wedding dress, half my makeup done, and I have to deal with this. So I march outside in my robe and slippers, my hair still in curlers. Jake sees me coming, and his face goes red. Before you say anything. No, I cut him off. Absolutely not. I told you three months ago she couldn't come. You said you wouldn't come. Now you're both here. Becca steps out from behind Jake, wearing this bright red dress that looks exactly like something a bride would Wear to her own reception. I'm not even kidding. It had sparkles and everything. I just wanted to support you on your special day, she says in this fake, sweet voice. I brought you a gift and everything. Get out, I said, both of you, right now! Jake starts yelling about how I'm being a bridezilla and how Becca just wants to be supportive. Meanwhile, Becca is taking selfies in front of the wedding.

I got a call from the daycare saying my four year old daughter, Hazel was burning up with fever. But when I went to pick her up, the daycare's director blocked me at the entrance. I'm sorry, Mister Fisher, but I cannot release Hazel to you. You're not authorized for emergency medical pickup. It took me a second to understand what she just said. What are you talking about? I'm literally her father. She's sick and she needs my help. Mrs. Patrick pulled out a thick binder labeled emergency protocols and started flipping the pages. Our insurance policy is very clear. In medical emergencies, children may only be released to the primary guardian. The primary listed is her mother. You are secondary. She showed me the form like it was federal law. I explained that her mother and I were divorced, I had weekday custody, her mother was two states away, and that Hazel needed my help ASAP. I understand. Said not moving from the doorway. But our liability insurance is clear. No exceptions. The rules protect our license. Through the window, I saw Hazel curled up in the sick room, face bright red and clutching her stomach in pain. She saw me and reached out crying, daddy! Missus! Patrick yanked the blinds shut. You need her mother's approval before you can pick her up. I tried calling Hazel's mother three times, but it kept going to voicemail. So I started arguing. With the director again begging her to let me in, 20 minutes passed, and this meathead woman still didn't understand what was at stake here. Through the door crack, I saw Hazel barely conscious with a red rash covering her neck. She's had a dangerous fever for an hour. Just let me take her to the hospital, I pleaded. Protocol is protocol, she replied. These rules exist for a reason. Enough is enough, I told myself. My daughter's life was in danger, and this woman blocking my path was obviously mentally ill. I pulled out my phone and dialed 9 1 1 right there in front of her. I need police assistance at this daycare. Mrs. Patrick went pale when she realized what I was doing. Sir, we're just following protocols. She hammered, but I kept going. My four year old has a really high fever, and they won't even let her father take her to a doctor. The dispatcher heard a child's life was in danger and immediately labeled my case as a priority. Once the officers arrived, I showed them my custody papers, license, and Hazel's birth certificate. They looked at Mrs. Patrick like she was dumb. This is his child. He has legal custody today. Release the child immediately. But our insurance protocol explicitly states. Insurance protocol doesn't override law, the officer interrupted. Refusing to release a child to their legal guardian is custodial interference. Open the damn door! Mrs. Patrick fumbled for keys, muttering about liability. Forms. They escorted me inside, where I finally scooped up hate. But she was in bad shape. Her skin was burning hot, her hair was matted with sweat, and that red rash was now covering her neck and chest. I rushed to the ER as fast as I could. But the doctor's expression turned grave when he examined Hazel's rash. This is scarlet fever. See the sandpaper texture? My heart felt like it had stopped. How serious is it, doctor? It's hard to say. If this had gone untreated another two to three hours. She paused. Charlotte fever causes rheumatic fever, permanent kidney damage, heart valve problems. You should be prepared. They rushed her away for emergency treatment. The next 12 hours were the longest of my life. Monitors beeping, nurses rushing in and out. Kidney function test every few hours. I couldn't leave her side, holding her tiny hand while she fought through the fever. Then the daycare called my phone. Did they want to apologize? Did they want to ask if my daughter was alright? Nope. They just wanted to know if she would be back Monday. I heard that and felt my patience physically snapping in half. I waited for Hazel's mother to arrive.

I can float for a couple minutes. Why? Don't move and don't leave the water no matter what. We need to clear it and evacuate everyone else. But you need to stay. What's in the water? My voice came out shaky. He didn't answer. Instead, he raised his whistle and blew three sharp blasts that echoed across the pool area. Everyone out of the pool immediately! This is not a drill! Family started rushing toward the ladders and stairs in a chaotic scramble. Kids were crying as parents hold mount! Water splashing everywhere. The shallow end emptied in seconds as people grabbed their belongings and ran. I wanted to join them, but I was stuck floating in 12 feet of water, trying not to move. Hold still! The lifeguard kept his eyes locked on the water around me. I was trying my best, but my arms were already getting tired from the careful balancing. The sun beat down, and without movement, the water felt colder. Some families had stopped at the fence instead of leaving completely. A few called out encouragement, telling me to relax and breathe and stay as still as possible possible. Others had their phones out, recording whatever was happening. I could see the little red lights pointing at me from multiple angles. Three other lifeguards appeared with long handled nets used for cleaning debris. They spread out around different Parts of the pool moving slowly and carefully. The one nearest to me kept a net raised, ready to strike at something. Their faces were all focused on the water, like they were hunting. My breathing quickened despite trying to stay calm. Something was in the pool with me. Something dangerous enough to evacuate everyone else but keep me frozen in place. The lifeguards crept along the edges, scanning every inch of water. One of the lifeguards near the diving board suddenly plunged his net into the water. He struggled with something heavy, pulling and twisting the pole. The other guards rushed over to help, leaving me unwatched for terrifying seconds. Together, they hauled up their catch, and my blood went cold. An alligator thrashed in the net. Not huge, but big enough. At maybe four feet. Its tail whipped back and forth as they struggled to control it. The crowd at the fence gasped, and more phones came out. So one called animal control, while the guards carefully carried the netted gator toward the bullhouse. But the lifeguard assigned to me didn't relax. He kept scanning the water around me with the same intensity. That's when I understood. If there was one, there might be more. Can I get out now? My voice cracked with ear. Not yet. Stay still. He pointed to something in the deep end. A dark shadow moved along the bottom, slow and purposeful, much bigger than the one they'd caught. The guards saw it. Too. They all shifted positions, trying to get an angle with their nets, but it was too deep, too far from the edges. It's circling under her, one of them said quietly. My whole body trembled, sending ripples across the surface. The shadow continued its lazy patrol roll of the deep end, sometimes closer to the surface where I could make out its prehistoric shape, sometimes deeper, where it became just a dark blur against the blue. Then someone in the crowd screamed, there's another one in the shallow end! All heads turned to see a smaller later that had been hiding near the steps. It must have been there the whole time, while families evacuated right past it. One lifeguard ran over with his net while the other stayed focused on the one beneath me. Animal control arrived in a van pulling up to the pool gate. Two officers in heavy gloves and protective gear came in with specialized equipment. They took over netting

If I was your daughter, I wouldn't go to school tomorrow. I'd look into moving to another district, the voice said loud enough for me to hear. Why not? Who is this? My mom asked, confused. Just a teacher who's looking out. I can't tell her why, but she needs to go to school elsewhere. The line went dead before my mom could ask anything else. She immediately asked if anything had happened at school recently that I hadn't told her about. Anyone been bothering me or making threats? I told her everything was normal and I had no idea what that phone call was about. My mom said she didn't know either, but she was going to find out. She started texting other parents in our neighborhood, asking if they'd heard anything strange about the school. While she was typing furiously on her phone, I grabbed mine and called my best friend, Georgia. She always knew all the gossip. Georgia answered on the second ring, sounding surprised to hear from me. I told her about the weird phone call and how a teacher said I shouldn't go to school anymore. There was a long pause before Georgia responded, and when she did, her voice sounded strange, almost like she was disappointed in me or something. Well, duh, it's because of the whiteboard. My stomach dropped, even though I had no idea what she was talking about. I asked her What whiteboard? And she made this sound like she couldn't believe I was asking. I thought you were avoiding everyone because of the whiteboard. I'm surprised you even called me. I practically yelled, asking what whiteboard she was talking about. Georgia sighed and said she'd send me the picture, but warned me it wasn't pretty. My phone buzz with her text, and I opened the image. It was a photo of a classroom whiteboard taken from the back of the room. Most of it had normal math equations, but in the top corner, someone had written something in red marker. Alicia O'Brien, you're next. You have 72 hours. I showed my mom the phone and watched her face go from pale to bright red with anger. She jumped up from the couch and started pacing around the living room, buttering about lawsuits and police reports. She kept saying this was unacceptable and heads were going to roll. I'd never seen her this fired up about anything. Oh, hell, no, we're calling the police, she said, reaching for her cell phone. But before she could even unlock it, we heard a car door slam outside. Through the front window, we could see a police cruiser parked in our driveway with its lights off. A uniformed officer was already walking up our front path. My mom and I looked at each other in confusion. How did they already know about the whiteboard? The doorbell rang, and my mom rushed to answer it. The officer was young and looked serious as he showed his badge. He asked if he could come in, and my mom dragged him inside. The officer stood in our living room with his hands on his belt, looking between me and my mom. He cleared his throat and pulled out a small notepad. Miss O'Brien, we have reports from multiple students that you may be a target due to your assault.

Her exes. When I confronted her, she laughed and said, yeah, he's not even yours. What are you going to do, divorce me? I stared at the birth certificate in complete shock. Instead of Christopher, the name we'd spent months choosing together, it read Zachary. Zachary? Her ex boyfriend's name from college. Allison, why is our son named Zachary? She didn't even look up from her phone. Scrolling casually. Last minute decision in the delivery room. I like Zachary better than Christopher. That's your ex's name? Her smile turned ice cold. Good catch, genius. Because he's Zachary's son, not yours. We've been together for eight months. While you were working those late nights at the office, my blood went ice cold. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? Zachary and I reconnected at my college reunion last year. Remember that weekend? I went alone because you were too busy. Well, I wasn't alone. She stood up, holding the baby I've been calling my son. And before you get all dramatic and threaten to leave, remember, this is a no fault state. I'm legally entitled to half your stuff. House, savings, that precious car collection. Stay and play daddy, or leave and pay child support for 18 years. Either way, I win. I walked out without saying a single word. First stop, DNA test. Clinic. Results in 48 hours, the technician said. Second stop, attorney's office downtown. Paternity fraud, Samantha explained. And after hearing my story, knowingly putting the wrong father on a birth certificate is criminal fraud. We can void the marriage entirely, recover damages, and she could face jail time. Over the next two weeks, I played the perfect defeated husband while secretly building my case. I acted hurt, but resigned. Exactly what Allison expected. She came incredibly bold, even bringing Zachary to our house while I was supposedly at work. I've been recording everything on my phone since day one. The DNA test came back exactly as expected. 0% probability of paternity. I feel terrible about this situation. I told Allison one evening, showing fake defeat. But maybe we should tell people the truth about Zachary being the father. She actually laughed. Why would we do that? This arrangement works perfectly. You make good money. Zachary is completely unreliable. You're obviously the better option for raising a kid. But isn't it fraud putting my name on the certificate? So what? Who's going to report it? You? You'd have to admit you weren't man enough to keep your wife satisfied. Every single word was being recorded. The final piece came when she texted your sister. Christopher. Such an idiot. He's actually considering staying and raising Zachary's kid. I'm getting everything I want, and he's too stupid to realize it. Screenshot saved immediately while Allison was at her mother's house showing off our baby. Professional movers arrived at exactly 9 a m. By noon, all my Personal belongings were safely in storage. I left divorce papers on the dining table with a note. All future communication through my attorney. P S. Zachary can support his own son underneath a comprehensive lawsuit for paternity fraud, an itemized Bill for every penny I'd spent on prenatal care and baby expenses, plus a USB drive containing all the recordings. My phone started buzzing within an hour. 23 missed calls, 47 increasingly frantic texts. I blocked her number and forwarded everything to Samantha. Allison was arrested for fraud within a week. Zachary, when contacted by authorities, denied everything and demanded his own DNA test. Turns out he didn't want to be a father, either. Three months later, someone knocked on my apartment door through the peephole. Allison holding the baby with two battered suitcases beside her. She looked completely broken. Unwashed hair, wrinkled clothes. Oh, this dark circles under her eyes. Christopher, please, I'm so sorry. Zachary won't return my calls anymore. My mom kicked me out when the fraud charges became public. I have nowhere else to go. I didn't open the door. I'll drop all

It started about six months ago. Every argument, every little thing that didn't go her way, slam. Every time I asked her to do dishes, slam. When I told her she couldn't go to some party where I knew there'd be drinking, slam. The sound would shake the whole upstairs. My coffee mug fell off my nightstand twice from the vibrations. My husband Dave, kept telling me to ignore it. He'd say kids go through phases. She'll grow out of it. Easy for him to say since he's usually at work when most of the slamming happens. I'm the one working from home trying to take client calls while slam echoes through the house. Breaking point came on a Tuesday. Emma wanted to borrow my car to drive to her friend Jesse's house. I said no because she got a speeding ticket the week before and we agreed her driving privileges were suspended. She started screaming about how unfair I was, how I never trust her, how all her friends think I'm psycho. Then she stomped upstairs and slam. But this time was different. This time I heard something crack. I went up to check and there was a split running down the door frame. The wood was actually damaged. That door had been slammed so hard and so many times that it was breaking the house. I stood there staring at that crack and something just snapped. In me. I marched to the garage, grabbed Dave's screwdriver set and went back upstairs. Emma was inside her room blasting music, probably expecting me to yell at her through the door like usual. Instead, I started unscrewing the hinges. It took me about 10 minutes. Emma didn't even notice until I was lifting the door off the frame. Then her music stopped. Real quick, mom, what are you doing? She called out. Solving a problem, I said. Carrying her door downstairs to the garage, he appeared at the top of the stairs in her pajamas, mouth hanging open. You can't take my door. I need privacy. You lost door privileges when you damaged the house. I told her privacy is earned, not guaranteed. The next few days were interesting. Emma tried everything. She hung a bed sheet across the doorway, which I took down. She moved her dresser to block the opening, so I moved it back. While she was at school, she even tried staying at her friend's house, but Jess's mom called me asking what was going on. By day 4, Emma was sitting on her bed when I got home from the grocery store. No music, no phone, just sitting there. This is embarrassing, she said. What if someone comes over? Then maybe you'll think twice before destroying property. I said, I wasn't destroying anything. I was just mad. The door frame says otherwise. That's when she actually looked at the crack she'd made. I could See her face change when she realized she'd actually damaged something. Day 7 was when things got real. Emma's boyfriend, Tyler, came over to work on some school project. I watched from the kitchen as he walked upstairs, expecting to go into her room and just stopped dead when he saw the empty doorway. Uh, where's your door, I heard him ask. Emma's voice got all quiet. My mom took it. Why there was a long pause because I kept slamming it. Tyler didn't say anything for a minute. Then I heard him go.

Show her everything. I replied, happy to help. Then I watched her file an HR complaint claiming I was incompetent. Her reaction when she found out her betrayal was the best thing that ever happened to me was pure bliss. I was supposed to get promoted next month. Already had the recommendation letters and my supervisor's promise. Then Catherine arrived, fresh from some online certification program that barely taught her excel. I need someone good to train her. My boss, Jonathan, says, looking at me, you're the best we have. Show her everything. Eight months of staying late to fix her mistakes, covering when she called in sick every month. One day teaching her basic things any office worker should know. You're so patient, Parker, she said. After another training session. She smiled sweetly. I'm really trying to learn. I'm taking lots of notes. Should have known. What kind of notes? On Thursday, Catherine filed a complaint against me. I came back from lunch to find Jonathan in my office with a thick folder. Catherine says you've been making mistakes as she's been doing your job, fixing your work. The folder was full of screenshots, emails she'd altered, time stamps from when I was training her, twisted to look like she was training me. I told him that all of those emails were fake and even had our I T. Guy back it up. But Jonathan didn't care. The decision Was already made. Why? Because Catherine had been spending time in his office. They had late meetings with the door closed. The Grapevine was saying his wife left him six months ago. Catherine was 23 and pretty. Do the math. So Jonathan told me, take the demotion or resign. Those are your options. Catherine's getting your position. I resigned that same day. Packed my desk while Catherine stood in the doorway, measuring my office with her eyes. It was obvious she was already planning where her yoga mat would go. My phone exploded on Friday. The texts from former clients I'd built relationships with over five years. They said, Parker, Catherine just sent us a proposal with last year's prices. Catherine told our biggest client their business model was stupid. Catherine sent confidential information to our competitor by mistake. Can you help us? As a consultant? I texted them back.

Hey, quick question about the Duncan account. Parker, please call back about the quarterly reports. This is urgent. Jonathan is asking about Cunningham Industries. You sabotaged me before you left. I didn't sabotage anything. You can't do the job, Catherine. You lied and slept your way into it. Two weeks later, Jonathan called personally. We need to talk. Catherine lost four major accounts. The board is asking questions. She can't even open The advanced spreadsheets doesn't understand basic formulas. I told him. She told you. She was doing my job for eight months. She lied about everything, Parker. Her resume, her references, even her degree. It's all fake. Who would have thought they had finally investigated properly and looked at the original emails. They saw the unedited documents. Security footage of Catherine in Jonathan's office at inappropriate hours. Her key

I was 15 when my life basically flipped upside down in the weirdest way possible. For months, I've been having these crazy stomach cramps that made me double over in the middle of class. My parents kept saying it was just stress from school, maybe too much coffee or whatever, but our family doctor wasn't buying it and sent me to get a full allergy panel done. I remember sitting in that sterile clinic room, rolling my eyes as the nurse prepped, like, 50 different allergen samples. I was thinking, great, I'm probably allergic to peanuts or milk like every other kid. Maybe shellfish if I'm unlucky. The nurse started pricking my arm with tiny needles, each one containing a different substance. Dust, mites, pollen, cat dander, the usual suspects. She kept checking her watch and marking down reactions as little red bumps appeared on my skin. Most were barely visible, just tiny dots that looked like mosquito bites. But then I noticed her face change when she looked at one specific spot on my arm. The area around this one test site was literally bubbling up like a balloon. My skin was bright red and swelling so fast, I could actually watch it grow. The nurse called in Doctor Kim, the allergist. I took one look at my arm, and I swear her clipboard hit the floor. She whispered, Oh, no. Under her breath. And immediately started ordering additional tests. I was like, what the hell is happening? What could possibly be that bad? Turns out I was severely allergic to chlorinated water. Not just

My brother said this with a grin right after I'd paid for his entire wedding. I smiled, nodded, and walked out. The next morning, I canceled everything. Let me back up. I'm a janitor at Jefferson High School. My younger brother, Alan, is the golden child who somehow convinced me to fund his dream wedding. Eight grand for catering, two grand for the venue deposit when his fiance's family forgot their checkbook. Another grand for her backup dress. I work double shifts for months. Skipped my first vacation in three years. But family is family, right? The day of the wedding, I had to work an emergency flood cleanup. Sewage pipe burst. I rushed to the reception, still in my work clothes, because I didn't want to miss Alan's speech. So there I was in the corner, still smelling faintly of bleach, when Alan grabbed the mic for his toast. First I want to thank my amazing brother, he announced to the 150 guests. Thanks for covering everything, bro. Real hero move. People turned to look at me. I smiled, uncomfortable. But he wasn't done. But let's be honest, he said, grinning wider. No one wants a janitor in the wedding photos. The room went dead silent. Then awkward, nervous laughter. His bride, Julia, hid behind her wine glass. A few cousins looked at their shoes. One of Alan's college buddies gave me a pitying glance. And turned away. I just stood there in my blue uniform shirt and work boots, industrial soap still lingering on my sleeves. The silence stretched until it became unbearable. I laughed once and said, you're absolutely right, Alan. That was it. I didn't throw my drink, didn't yell, didn't storm out dramatically. I just smiled at my little brother, turned around, and walked to the parking lot like nothing happened. But inside, something cracked. Clean and quiet, the way you don't feel a paper cut until you see the blood. I sat in my car for 10 minutes, watching people dance through the reception hall windows. They look like shadows against the fairy lights. I pulled out my phone. Open the catering confirmation email. 8 thousand 793 $24. Non refundable if canceled within 24 hours of the event. I was just in time. I hit cancel. $8,000 back in my account. Then I booked a one way ticket to Costa Rica. My phone started buzzing around 6 p m. Missed calls from everyone. The caterers never showed up. Tables sat empty. Guests were leaving hungry. Julia was crying in the bathroom. By 8 p m, I had 47 missed calls. The texts started rolling in. Julia? Aiden, where are you? Do you know how humiliated we were? Mom, please tell me this is a misunderstanding. Dad. Aiden, call me now. And then from Alan. Dude, you went too far. Like I said, no one wants a janitor in wedding photos. But this? This is pathetic. No apology, just more mockery. When mom called the next morning, she was furious. Julia's family is livid, she snapped. They spent all that money and everyone went home hungry. Julia's family? I laughed, but really? You mean the people who contributed zero dollars but left the entire Bill to me? It was just a joke, honey. Maybe if you dressed better. That's when I knew they weren't embarrassed by what Alan said. They were embarrassed by me. I hung up. Dad called an hour later. What were you thinking? We had people calling us all night. Dad, I said quietly, when Alan dropped out of college, who paid his tuition? When his car broke down, who bought him a new transmission? When you were behind on the mortgage, who covered three months of payments? Silence! I've always shown up. And not once has anyone thanked me without making me feel guilty for existing. You're being dramatic. No, dad, I'm being done. A week later, I went to Alan's apartment. Not to apologize, just to drop something off. He opened the door in basketball shorts, beer in hand. Oh, he said, scratching his belly. The ghost returns. I handed him a Manila folder. What's this? Every receipt from your wedding. Catering decorations, Julia's dress, the

My ex husband Paul, got married when my son Caleb was 6. His new wife, Dana, seemed nice enough at first. She worked in marketing, had no kids, and I always treated Caleb well whenever I saw them together. I figured having an extra person who cared about my son was a good thing. But Caleb started coming home from his dad's weekends acting strange. He'd be quiet for hours, just staring at the wall. When I'd ask about his weekend, he'd give me one word answers. I thought maybe he was just tired or adjusting to the new family situation. Then came the first red flag. Caleb walked into the kitchen one Tuesday morning and said, Mommy. Dana says I can call her mommy, too, if I want. She says maybe I'll live with her forever someday. My stomach dropped. Kept my voice calm and asked what he meant. He explained that Dana had been giving him homework where he had to practice writing his name with Dana and Paul's last name instead of mine. She'd sit with him at the kitchen table, guiding his little hand to trace over the letters. I felt sick, but tried not to overreact. Kids say things they don't understand all the time. But something felt wrong. The next week, I got a call from Caleb's school nurse. She said they couldn't reach me because my contact information had Been updated. When I asked what she meant, she said Dana was now listed as the primary emergency contact. My number had been moved to secondary. I rushed to the school immediately. The secretary looked confused when I showed up, angry. Oh, we were told custody had changed. She said Dana even brought in official documents last month. I demanded to see those documents. What I found made my blood run cold. They were adoption papers, supposedly signed by me, giving Dana full parental rights. The letterhead looked official, but the court seal was from three years ago, and the notary stamp had expired two years back. Dana had forged them. I called my lawyer that same afternoon. When Paul was confronted, he claimed he had no idea what Dana was doing. But when I pushed harder, Dana insisted she was just trying to make things easier for the school system. She said it was confusing for everyone to have so many different contacts and names. But the scariest part wasn't the forged papers. It was what Caleb started saying. Began calling me my other mom, and would tell me things like, Dana says we're going to court soon to make it real. And Dana says, you won't be sad because you'll still get to visit me sometimes. Someone had been filling my 6 year old's head with the idea that I was just temporary, that Dana was going to be his real mom. I realized this wasn't confusion or Overstepping boundaries. This was a calculated campaign to erase me from my own child's life. I documented everything. Every forged paper, every inappropriate conversation.

I was 15, and my mom had started pulling double shifts at the diner to keep up with the bills. She asked me to pick up my little sister Kayla from school and walk her home. I didn't mind. Kayla was 8 and honestly the coolest kid I knew. She'd always want to stop at the park on Oak Street to swing for a bit before we went home. That Friday started normal. I grabbed her from the school pickup line and we walked to Miller's Ice Cream like we always did. Got her usual chocolate chip cookie dough. I got mint chip. She was talking non stop about some art project her teacher loved. Bouncing around with her pink backpack that had unicorns all over it. We hit the park around 3:30. Kayla ran straight to the swings while I sat on this old wooden bench, put my headphones in and started scrolling through music. Nothing weird about it. Same thing we did every week. Ten minutes later, I looked up and she was gone. Not on the swings, not on the slide, not hiding behind the big oak tree where she sometimes played pretend. Just gone. I ripped my headphones out and started yelling her name. Ran around the whole park, checking behind every bush and tree. Asked this old guy walking his dog if he'd seen a little girl with brown pigtails. Nothing. Called my mom's work, but she Was in the middle of her shift and couldn't answer. That's when I called 9 1 1. Within five minutes, the park was crawling with cops. Church dogs showed up maybe 20 minutes after that, then helicopters. My mom got there around 4:15, still wearing her diner uniform with the coffee stains on it. She was crying before she even got out of her car. The cops kept asking me the same questions over and over. What was she wearing? Did I see anyone suspicious? Why wasn't I watching her? I kept saying I only looked down for like, two minutes max. But honestly, every time they asked, I felt less sure. Around 7 that night, they found her backpack behind some gas station dumpster two blocks away. The unicorn one, with her art supplies still inside. But no Kayla. That's when everyone really started panicking. The search went on for three days straight. Volunteers from all over town showed up. They had her picture on every telephone pole and shop window. My mom basically stopped sleeping, stopped eating. Just sat by the phone waiting for updates. But the worst part wasn't even the not knowing. It was how everyone looked at me. My mom wouldn't make eye contact. My aunts kept whispering when they thought I couldn't hear. Kids at school either stared at me like I was some kind of monster or avoided me completely. My Uncle Steve pulled me aside after the fourth day and said, maybe I should think about what really happened that day. Like I was lying or something. Even my mom started asking weird questions. Like whether I was sure I hadn't fallen asleep. Or if maybe I'd been on my phone longer than I thought. Everyone blamed me. Family, neighbor

I thought Ryan was perfect. Good looking, funny. Treated me like I was the only girl in the world. We've been dating for about eight months. When he finally introduced me to his mom, she seemed nice enough at first. Big hug, lots of questions about my job, told me I was prettier than my photos. But then weird stuff started happening. Like Ryan and I would make plans to go see a movie, and his mom would text him right before saying she needed him to come fix her computer. Or we'd be having dinner and she'd call crying about how lonely she was since the divorce. Every single time. At first, I felt bad for her. I mean, divorce is hard. But then I noticed she only had these emergencies when Ryan was with me. Ever when he was at work or hanging out with his guy friends. Just when we were together. One night, we were at my apartment watching Netflix when she called at, like, 11 p m. She was sobbing about having a flat tire and being scared to change it herself. Ryan jumped up immediately, grabbed his keys, and said he'd be right back. I offered to come with him, but he said no, it would be faster if he went alone. He didn't come back that night. Texted me at 2 a m. Saying his mom was too shaken up and he Needed to stay over to make sure she was okay. When I drove by her house the next morning on my way to work, her car was in the driveway with all four tires perfectly fine. That's when I started paying closer attention. Every time we plan something special, his mom would suddenly need him. My birthday dinner. She needed groceries. Our weekend trip. She had a mystery illness that required constant checking on our six month anniversary. Emergency plumbing situation that somehow only Ryan could handle. I tried talking to Ryan about it. Told him I understood. He wanted to be there for his mom, but it felt like she was doing it on purpose. He got defensive, said I was being jealous of his mom, which was ridiculous. And she'd been through a lot with the divorce, and he was all she had. But it kept getting worse. She started showing up places we were. Like, we'd be at target, and suddenly there she was, saying, what a coincidence, and then following us around the whole store. Or we'd be at a restaurant, and she'd walk in, claiming she was meeting a friend, but then sit at the table next to us the entire time. The breaking point was when she called me directly. I was at home doing laundry when my phone rang. It was her number, so I figured maybe she was looking for Ryan instead. She said she needed to talk to me. Woman to Woman. She told me I seemed like a nice girl, but I needed to understand that no woman could ever love Ryan the way his mother did. That she'd given birth to him, raised him, sacrificed everything for him. She said I should probably find someone else because Ryan would always choose his family first. And I just end up disappointed. I hung up on her and immediately called Ryan, told him exactly what his mom had said. Instead of being horrified, he made excuses. And she was probably just worried about him getting hurt. That she'd warm up to me eventually, that I should try to understand where she was coming from. That night, Ryan came over and promised he'd talk to her about boundaries. Said he'd make it clear that our

At least it'll be edible. I've been cooking since 6 a m. Turkey, stuffing, three sides, homemade rolls. My hands were burned from the oven, my feet screaming. Everyone just sat there when Kelly said it. Even my husband Mark smirked. So I stood up, untied my apron, and said, you know what? You're absolutely right. Then I walked to the kitchen and called every restaurant in town, booked take out orders for every single holiday this year under Kelly's name and credit card info from her purse. Christmas dinner for 15 people from the most expensive steakhouse. New Year's catering for 20. Easter brunch delivery. I came back smiling. Good news. I solve the take out problem for every holiday. Kelly's treating everyone this year. Since my cooking isn't good enough. Kelly went white. What are you talking about? Check your email. Confirmation numbers are being sent now. Merry Christmas! Mark tried to say something, but I was already grabbing my keys. Oh, and Kelly, the Christmas steakhouse order is one hour and $200. Hope your credit card can handle it. I drove to my sister's house and didn't come back until Monday. Kelly called my phone 47 times that weekend. The restaurants wouldn't cancel without a fee. She ended up paying over $3,000 for holiday meals she never wanted. But here's where it gets better. Christmas morning arrives, and I'm at My sister's house, drinking coffee in my pajamas when my phone explodes. First Mark, then his mom, then Kelly again. I let them all go to voicemail while I watch my nieces open presents. Finally, around 10 a m, I listen to the messages. Kelly's sobbing. The steakhouse is here with one new hundred dollars worth of food, and I don't have the money. My card got declined. They're threatening to call the police for theft of services. Please, I'm begging you, call them back. Mark's message was just angry breathing. And call me back right now or I'm filing for divorce. His mom left a message saying the family was deeply disappointed in my childish behavior and maybe I should seek professional help for my obvious mental breakdown. The last message was Kelly again, crying harder. My husband found out about the other orders. The New Year's catering, the Easter brunch. He's talking about leaving me. My kids are asking why Mommy won't stop crying. Please, I'll do anything. I apologize to everyone. I'll never say another word about your cooking. I screenshot all the messages and sent them to my sister. We laughed until we couldn't breathe. But then my sister made a good point. What if they actually call the cops on Kelly? This could destroy her life. So I called the steakhouse back. Hi, this is about the Kelly Johnson order. I'm her sister in law, and there's been a misunderstanding. She insulted my cooking at Thanksgiving. So I ordered this as a lesson, using her information. I'd like to pay for it myself and have you deliver it to this address instead. I gave them my sister's address. Best Christmas lunch we ever had. Prime rib, lobster tails. The worst. Meanwhile, Kelly's family ate gas station sandwiches for Christmas dinner because nothing else was open. When I finally went home Tuesday, Mark was sitting at the kitchen table surrounded by empty takeout containers and unpaid bills. He looked like he'd aged five years. We ate McDonald's for Christmas dinner, he said quietly. Mom cried. Kelly hasn't stopped apologizing. Her husband almost left her. How was the McDonald's? I asked, sitting down across from him. Terrible cold. The kids were devastated. I nodded. Maybe next time someone will appreciate home cooking. I'm sorry, he said finally. I should have defended you, Kelly.

Which, technically, for me, it was. Everything suddenly made sense. Remember when I fainted during swim practice last year? Coach Mitchell thought I was being dramatic and made me run laps instead. Those family trips to water parks where I'd get mysteriously sick afterward. My parents blamed it on junk food. The way my skin would burn and itch after long showers. I just thought I was using too much soap. The worst part was realizing how much damage I'd already done to myself. Every single day at swim practice, I was basically poisoning my body. No wonder I was always exhausted and my times kept getting worse. My teammates thought I was slacking off, and honestly, so did I. I kept pushing myself harder, thinking I just wasn't trying enough. My swim coach had even pulled me aside a few weeks before the test, telling me I needed to step up if I wanted to make varsity next year. She said I seemed lazy and unfocused during practice. I felt so guilty because swimming was literally my whole life. Been on the team since middle school and had dreams of getting a college scholarship. The diagnosis was devastating. Doctor Kim explained that continued exposure could cause serious respiratory problems and even anaphylactic shock. I had to quit swimming. Immediately. No more early morning practices. No more meets. No more dreams of being team captain. I cried for, like, three days straight.

I pulled out my phone and showed everyone the pregnancy test photo I'd taken that morning. Brandon's wife, Rachel, is eight weeks pregnant. Congratulations. You're going to be a stepdad. The color drained from Brandon's face. My wife's triumphant smirk vanished instantly. See, Rachel had called me crying at 6 a m. She'd found Brandon's burner phone with months of messages to my wife. Hotel bookings, love letters, the whole affair laid out in black and white. Rachel wasn't just. She was furious and pregnant. And a divorce attorney. Rachel's already filed the papers. I continued, watching Brandon panic. She's going for everything. The house, the business. Full, full custody. She documented everything. Must. My wife tried to grab Brandon's arm, but he was already backing away. This isn't what we planned, she whispered. Oh, and honey, I said, pulling out another document, remember that promotion you've been working toward? Your boss got a very interesting email this morning about company A policy violations. She stared at me in horror. You didn't. I didn't have to. Rachel's very thorough when she's angry. Brandon was already at the door, phone pressed to his ear, probably calling Rachel.

My fiance Anthony has this whole thing about his morning coffee. Not like a normal person who just drinks whatever is there. No, this guy needs his coffee made in a very specific way or his entire day is apparently ruined. French press only. Water heated to exactly 200 degrees. Four minutes of steam in time, no more, no less. And the coffee has to be this expensive organic stuff from some fancy roaster downtown that cost, like 30 bucks a bag. I've been living with this routine for two years now. Every single morning, I wake up 20 minutes before him just to start this whole coffee ceremony. The timer, heat the water, measure everything out perfectly, because god forbid Anthony has to make his own coffee like a functioning adult. But yesterday morning, I was running late for work. My alarm didn't go off, and I had exactly 15 minutes to get ready and leave. So I did what any normal person would do. I made regular coffee in our regular coffee maker. Use the good beans, but just press a button instead of doing the whole French press thing. Anthony came downstairs and immediately knew something was different. He took one sip, and his face went all twisted up like I just served him poison. This isn't how I like my coffee, he said, holding the mug like it personally offended him. I explained that I was Running late and didn't have time for the whole production. That's when he lost it. Started yelling about how I don't respect his preferences and how hard is it to just make coffee the right way. I'm standing there in my work clothes, keys in hand, and this grown man is having a meltdown over coffee. You know how important this is to me. He kept saying, it's the one thing I asked for. I finally snapped, Anthony, it's coffee. It's literally just coffee. And also, it's not the one thing you ask for. You ask for a lot of things. Got all quiet and weird, then said I was being dismissive of his needs, that if I really loved him, I'd wanna make sure he started his day right. The whole conversation was so ridiculous, I almost laughed. So I told him, fine, from now on, he could make his own coffee, however he wanted it. I wasn't going to be his personal barista anymore. He acted like I just broken up with him. So you're just going to stop doing things for me? Like making coffee? With some grand gesture of love, and not just me enabling his weirdly specific morning demands? I left for work and spent the whole day thinking about it. When I got home, Anthony was sitting at the kitchen table with this defeated look on his face. Apparently, he tried to make the French press coffee himself and messed it up. Burned his Tongue on water that was too hot, made it too strong. The whole thing was a disaster. I guess I took for granted how good you are at making it, he said, trying to sound all apologetic. But here's the thing that really got to me. He wasn't sorry for freaking out or making demands. He was just upset that his coffee routine got disrupted. So I sat down and explained that I'm not his mom or his personal assistant. I'm his partner, and partners don't make elaborate demands about

I'm sitting with my friends, bored out of my mind when I mutter under my breath we want pizza! Just to make them laugh. But the guy in front of me hears it. He stands up, cups his hands, and yells we want pizza! And then it spreads like wildfire. First a couple rows, then the entire student section. Suddenly hundreds of voices are booming we want pizza! We want pizza! The cheerleaders stop mid flip. The band drummer joins in. Even parents are yelling it. The ref actually pauses the game because the chant is so loud. Players on the field are looking around confused like what do pizza slices have to do with foot? People are stomping on the bleachers, clapping in rhythm, turning it into a stadium wide protest. Phones are out recording. It feels less like a high school game and more like a revolution. Meanwhile, I'm sinking into my seat thinking oh no, I caused this. Finally, over the loudspeaker, the announcer cracks and says if the home team scores, free pizza after the game. The crowd goes ballistic. People are hugging strangers, mascots, crowd surfing. Nobody cares about the score anymore. We just want a touchdown and a slice and It's all because I said three words

Okay, this is exactly why your ex boyfriend broke up with you. You're such a freaking control freak! My sister Ellen groaned as she slammed her hand on my color coded binder. Our parents 30th anniversary only happens once. It needs to be perfect back, I explained, pushing her hands away from my binder. Perfect! She laughed. You made me call 20 vendors for quotes. I missed my boyfriend's birthday dinner to taste test cakes with you, dude. Literally. Like mom and dad don't care about whether the napkins we buy are gold or champagne. At this point, the party won't even be done on time. Ellen plopped down on the couch, completely frustrated. I sat down beside her and said gently, you don't understand. Mom mentioned she never got a real wedding reception. She just rolled her eyes and gave a sour expression. Oh my god, you're always like this. You're so obsessive over details. This is why no one wants to do anything with you anymore, she ranted, delivering the final blow. Why can't you just chill and keep things simple for once? I stared at my binder with all its tabs and highlights and detailed notes. Then I shoved it aside, watching papers across the floor. Fine, you want simple? Let's just throw something together. Her face lit up immediately. Finally. Thank you. So I went simple. Really simple. Instead of invitations, I opened up Facebook and created an event prize party for mom and Dad's 30th anniversary. I set it to public and hit create. Done in 30 seconds. And everything else went the same way. Decorations, dollar store and target. Doesn't matter if the colors match or not. Music. I'm sure the phone speaker will be fine. Ellen started texting me constantly about random people asking questions. I kept telling her the same thing. Just choose whatever you wanted. Simple. After a while, I stopped responding altogether. A week before the party, Ellen showed up at my door with bags under her eyes. She'd been up for three days straight googling how to throw anniversary party and managing RSVPs from people we didn't even know. You were supposed to help me, not completely abandon me, she said. I shrugged. I just overcomplicate things with my silly color coded binders. And don't worry so much. Just chill, I told her. She stared at me for a long moment, then left without another word. No stress, no spreadsheets, no calling vendors at midnight, just like she wanted. The day before the party, we met at the venue to set up. My sister stood in the middle of an empty room with random decorations scattered on a folding table. A crooked Happy Anniversary banner hung from one wall. This is bad. This is really, really bad. She panicked. Her phone buzzed with a cake confirmation. She opened it and smiled for a second. At least the Cake will be nice. Triple chocolate fudge. Their favorite. I couldn't hide my shocked expression. Her face scrunched up, looking even more worried. What? What's wrong now? It's just Dad's allergic to chocolate. I hold her. All the color from her face drained instantly. What? Since when? Since forever. Ellen. He breaks out in hives. How was I supposed to know that? You never told me. She started pacing around the room. Oh, my god. What else don't I know? Mom's favorite flowers. Their first dance song. Yellow Roses at last by at a. James. And definitely not Dolores with her sketchy boyfriend. She collapsed into a folding chair. I invited Dolores. She already Rsvped? Yes. She put her head in her hands. I've been up for three nights googling how to throw anniversary party.

Rachel found out about the joint credit card you opened. The one with 30,000 $10 in charges for your romantic getaways. Guess who's responsible for that debt now that Brandon's assets are frozen? My mother in law spoke up. What are you talking about? Oh, Teresa, you might want to call your advisor. Your daughter used you as co signer on that apartment lease downtown. The one for her business meetings. Rachel's law firm is very interested in that fraudulent application. My wife went white. You can't prove any of this. I don't need to. I smiled. Rachel has the bank records, hotel surveillance footage, and testimony from the private investigator. You were too careless to notice. The room erupted. My dad started laughing. My mom was taking pictures of my wife's horrified expression. My nephew pulled out his phone to record one more thing, I announced, and the room went silent. Rachel wants to meet tomorrow, both of you at her law office. Something about a civil suit for alienation of affection and emotional distress. She's seeking $500,000 in damages. Brandon went pale. My wife stumbled backward, knocking over her chair. But wait, I continued checking my phone. Rachel says the story just went live on her legal blog. When your husband's affair partner thinks she's won a case. It's got 15,000 views already. My wife started hyperventilating. Brandon was frantically trying to call someone, hands shaking so badly he kept dropping his phone. Rachel's firm specializes in high profile divorces. Every lawyer in the city will know about this by tomorrow. Good luck finding representation. My wife collapsed into her chair, sobbing. This will ruin everything! Everything was already ruined when you decided to humiliate me in front of my family. I replied calmly, now everyone sees who you really are, Brandon.

Don't contact me again. I replied. Fine. Then I canceled her credit cards and cut all financial support. Three days later, she was at my door, begging. My wife and I had been together for 10 years. Last Tuesday at 7 p m, I was making pasta while Alexis sat on her phone looking like she'd rather be anywhere else. Then, out of nowhere, I'm moving out tonight. I stopped stirring and looked at her. She wasn't even looking at me, still glued to her phone. Okay, I. She finally looked up with surprise and annoyance. I wasn't causing a scene. That's it. Okay? You said you're moving out. What am I supposed to do, chain you up? I just need space. I'm not happy. Clearly, I said, nodding toward the half packed duffel bag by the kitchen island. This wasn't spur of the moment. She'd been planning this. I'm serious, Logan. I'll get my things later. Don't contact me. I'll contact you when I'm ready to talk about the rest. Fine, I said. She grabbed her bag, purse, and keys to the car I'd paid off last year and walked out without a glance. Back door clicked. Silence. I sat there numb for 10 minutes, watching pasta water boil over. Then clarity hit me. She wanted out. Her decision. Fine. My turn to make decisions. I grabbed my laptop. First, her supplementary Amex Platinum linked to my account. She loved that card. Canceled. Reason. Card holder no longer authorized. Next, her visa, also supplementary. Gone. Then the automatic monthly transfer. A generous sum from my checking to her personal account for self care, since her part time styling job didn't cover her expensive tastes. Canceled phone plan. Disabled international roaming for her inspiration trips. It wasn't anger, it was consequences. She wanted out. Fine. She was out all the way. She couldn't have the freedom in my financial safety net. I ate burnt pasta alone and slept so surprisingly well. Three days of blessed quiet followed. I tidied up, ditched her clutter, watched my shows on the big TV. Then nine PM Thursday, persistent knocking through the peephole. Alexis, flustered, hair messy, wearing a generic hoodie instead of designer clothes. Logan, she said breathlessly when I opened the door. Alexis, I replied calmly, like she was a neighbor asking for sugar. My card was declined. The Amex at dinner. It was so embarrassing, right? I said. I canceled it. Her jaw dropped. You what? Why? You moved out. Alexis said, don't contact me. That card was for my household. You're not part of it anymore. Your choice, but I needed that. I had dinner with Vincent. Vincent? Her friend, who apparently wasn't paying first thing. Sounds like a you and Vincent problem, I said, staying in the doorway. Logan, this isn't fair. I need money. My visa isn't working either. Also canceled. I confirmed. And the transfer? The monthly transfer didn't come. Through she wailed, tears starting. Correct. That was your allowance as my wife. Living in my home. Part of our life. You ended that arrangement. For a moment, I saw vulnerability flicker across her face. A decade gone with a casual fine. Then I remembered her face. Glue to that phone. Casually nuking our marriage without discussion. You can't just cut me off, she insisted. We're married. We are. And I'm not touching marital assets. Your car is yours, paid off. Your personal bank account is yours. This house is mine.

I defended myself without a lawyer. When the judge heard their plan, their case collapsed. I'm 29, just bought my first house after saving for eight years. Two days after closing, my parents sued me for it. They wanted to give it to my sister Melissa because she has student loans. Let me give you some background. I started working at 16 grocery stores, pizza delivery, whatever I could get. I'm financially independent. At 18 when I bought my first car, a beat up Honda with 200 k miles for $800. Went to community college while working full time. Then did coding boot camps. Been in cyber security for 8 years now. Melissa, she's the golden child. Private university, masters in art history. Studied abroad in Europe twice. My parents paid for everything. Tuition, housing, spring break trips to Cabo. They even bought her a BMW for her sweet 16. I live with three roommates until last year. Ate ramen for dinner most nights. Never took vacations. Finally saved enough for a 385 thousand dollar house. Three bedrooms, two baths, decent neighborhood. Put down $77,000 from my savings. Their lawsuit was completely insane. They claimed I owed them $300,000 for raising me, and since they invested in my success, they deserved my house. They wanted the title transferred to Melissa while I kept paying the mortgage for two years. Their reasoning? She has student loans and can't afford city rent. I'm doing well and can easily buy another house. The family pressure was intense. My aunt was financing their lawsuit because she's always hated me. She told everyone I was ungrateful and thought I was better than the family because I work in tech. Melissa started posting Pinterest photos of houses on Instagram with captions like can't wait to make this house a home. Thanks mom and dad for fighting for what's right. I couldn't afford a 15,000 dollar lawyer, so I represented myself. Spent weeks preparing bank statements, mortgage DOC proof of every payment I'd made. Their attorney was some ambulance chaser who looked embarrassed from day one. Court day arrived. My parents showed up with Melissa and my aunt, all wearing matching Family First t shirts like some twisted team uniform. Melissa tried to hug me in the hallway, saying loudly, I forgive you for making us do this, stepped back, and she nearly fell over. When the judge asked for their evidence, things got absolutely wild. My dad stood up mid presentation and started ranting about ungrateful children and family values. My aunt, sitting in the gallery, shouted that I thought I was better than everyone and deserved to be taught a lesson. The judge warned them about courtroom decorum, but they couldn't help themselves. Then Melissa made the fatal mistake. She interrupted the judge mid sentence, screaming, your honor, he owes us! We raised him! That house should rightfully be mine! He's being completely selfish! The Judge's face went stone cold. Ma'am, sit down immediately, or I'll hold you in contempt of court. But Melissa was on a roll. She kept going.

My daughter Emma is 25 and absolutely beautiful, not just physically, but she's charming in a way that makes everyone want to be around her. She's got this perfect smile and this laugh that makes guys lose their minds. Her boyfriend, Tyler, is head over heels for her. The poor guy follows her around like a lost puppy and talks about her like she hung the moon. But here's the thing, nobody knows. Emma is a diagnosed sociopath, has been since she was 18, though I knew something was off way before that. When she was 8, she locked her little sister Mia in the basement for three hours just to see what would happen. When I found Mia crying and scared in the dark, Emma was upstairs watching TV like nothing happened. When I asked her why she did it, she just shrugged and said she was curious. No tears, no sorry, nothing. School was a nightmare. Teachers called constantly about Emma lying to get other kids in trouble, stealing lunch money. And once she convinced a boy to eat glue by telling him it was candy. The counselor said she was just going through a phase, but I knew better. After years of therapy and medication, Emma Learned how to act normal. She, she studied other people like a science project, copying their emotions until she could fake them perfectly by High school, she was popular, dated constantly and had everyone fooled. The diagnosis came when she was 18, antisocial personality disorder. The doctor explained it in fancy terms, but basically Emma doesn't feel love, guilt or empathy. She can't. Her brain just doesn't work that way. We've had honest conversations about it since then. When her best friend died in a car accident last year, Emma cried at the funeral and gave this heartbreaking speech later that night. She told me she felt absolutely nothing. The whole thing was an act because that's what people expected. She's been with Tyler for almost two years now. He's a good guy, works as a teacher, volunteers at animal shelters, brings me coffee when he visits. He talks about marrying Emma constantly. Last week, he asked me for my blessing to propose. That's when I told Emma she needs to tell him the truth or I will. She laughed and said I'd never have the guts. She thinks I'm bluffing because she's my daughter and I love her. But Tyler deserves to know what he's signing up for. Emma flat out told me she doesn't love him, never has and never will. She likes the stability he provides and thinks he'll be a good father if they have kids. To her, marriage is just a business transaction. When I brought it up again yesterday, Emma got that cold look in her eyes that used to terrify me when she was little. She said, If I told Tyler anything, she disappear from my life forever and make sure I never see any future grandchildren. Tyler's planning to propose next month. He asked me to help pick out a ring every time he talks about their future together.

My phone loaded on Friday with texts from former clients I'd built relationships with over five years. They said, Parker, Catherine just sent us a proposal with last year's prices. Catherine told our biggest client their business model was stupid. Catherine sent confidential information to our competitor by mistake. Can you help us as a consultant? I texted them back. My rate is 1:50 an hour. When do I start? By the next Wednesday, I had eight clients. Catherine kept calling, leaving 17 voicemails that got increasingly desperate.

I didn't sabotage anything. You can't do the job, Catherine. You lied and slept your way into it. Two weeks later, Jonathan called personally. We need to talk. Catherine lost four major accounts.

I came back from lunch to find Jonathan in my office with a thick folder. Catherine says you've been making mistakes. Says she's been doing your job, fixing your work. The folder was full of screenshots, emails she'd altered, time stamps from when I was training her, twisted to look like she was training me. I told him that all of those emails were fake and even had our IT guy back it up. But Jonathan didn't care. The decision was already made. Why? Because Catherine had been spending time in his office. They had late meetings with the door closed. The Grapevine was saying his wife left him six months

It should go to your sister, they argued in court. I defended myself without a lawyer. When the judge heard their plan, their case collapsed. I'm 29. Just bought my first house after saving for eight years. Two days after closing, my parents sued me for it. They wanted to give it to my sister Melissa because she has student loans. Let me give you some background. I started working at 16 grocery stores, pizza delivery, whatever I could get. Became financially independent at 18 when I bought my first car, a beat up Honda with 200 k miles for $800. Went to community college while working full time. Then did coding boot camps. Been in cyber security for 8 years now. Melissa, she's the golden child. Private university, masters in art history. Studied abroad in Europe twice. My parents paid for everything. Tuition, housing, spring break trips to Cabo. They even bought her a BMW for her sweet 16. I lived with three roommates until last year. Ate ramen for dinner most nights. Never took vacations. Finally saved enough for a 385 thousand dollar house. Three bedrooms, two baths. It's a neighborhood. Put down $77,000 from my savings. Their lawsuit was completely insane. They claimed I owed them $300,000 for raising me, and since they invested in my success, they deserved my house. They wanted the title transferred to Melissa while I kept paying the mortgage for two years. Their reasoning? She Has student loans and can't afford city rent. But I'm doing well and can easily buy another house. The family pressure was intense. My aunt was financing their lawsuit because she's always hated me. She told everyone I was ungrateful and thought I was better than the family because I work in tech. Melissa started posting Pinterest photos of houses on Instagram with captions like can't wait to make this house a home. Thanks mom and dad for fighting for what's right. I couldn't afford a 15 thousand dollar lawyer, so I represented myself. Spent weeks preparing bank statements, mortgage documents, proof of every payment I'd made. Attorney with some ambulance chaser who looked embarrassed from day one. Court day arrived. My parents showed up with Melissa and my aunt, all wearing matching Family First t shirts like some twisted team uniform. Melissa tried to hug me in the hallway, saying loudly, I forgive you for making us do this. Stepped back and she nearly fell over. When the judge asked for their evidence, things got absolutely wild. My dad stood up mid presentation and started ranting about ungrateful children and family values. My aunt, sitting in the gallery, shouted that I thought I was better than everyone and deserved to be taught a lesson. The judge warned them about courtroom decorum, but they couldn't help themselves. Then Melissa made the fatal mistake. She interrupted the judge mid sentence, screaming, your honor, he owes us! We raised him that house Should rightfully be mine. He's being completely selfish. The judge's face went stone cold. Ma'am.

He fired me on the spot. But the next day, the CEO asked, why did you let him go? Didn't you see the contract? I'm Gabriel, 34, working as a project coordinator at Data Flow Solutions, a growing tech startup. This CEO Son, Austin, manages our international partnerships. And honestly, he's always been intimidated by me since I started six months ago. Austin's one of those guys who got his position through nepotism, but tries to act like he earned it. He's constantly trying to prove himself by micromanaging everyone, especially me. I think he sees me as a threat because I actually know what I'm doing. Last Tuesday, we had this massive client call with Yamamoto Industries, a Japanese company worth actually 12 million in revenue. This wasn't just any deal. It was the biggest contract our company had ever pursued. The call started at two PM. Austin was leading the presentation, trying to explain our software capabilities through this clunky translator app on his phone. I could see the confusion on the Japanese executives faces through the video call. They kept asking clarifying questions in broken English, and Austin kept getting more flustered. So our platform enables. Austin kept pausing to type into his translator. Data synchronization across multiple. Hold on. The Japanese team was exchanging glances, clearly losing patience. I was sitting in the corner just watching this disaster unfold. I could understand every word they were saying. In Japanese, they were talking among themselves, saying things like, this is unprofessional and maybe we should reconsider this part partnership. But I stayed quiet. Austin had specifically told me before the call that I was only there to take notes and learn and shouldn't interrupt under any circumstances. After 30 excruciating minutes, the Japanese team politely ended the call, saying they needed to reassess their options. Austin's face was red with embarrassment and anger. The moment the call ended, Austin exploded. You just sat there doing absolutely nothing! You're completely useless! He screamed. I'm busting my ass trying to save this deal, and you're just sitting there like a statue! I tried to speak, Austin, if you'd let me. No excuses. You never contribute to any of our international deals. I'm done with you, Gabriel, pack your desk right now. You're fired. I didn't argue. Just grabbed my stuff from my desk, packed my personal items into a cardboard box, and walked out. The next morning, I was having coffee at home when my phone rang. It was the CEO. Gabriel, this is Richard. Can you come in today? We need to talk urgently. I walked into Richard's corner office to find Austin sitting there looking confused and slightly annoyed. The CEO had our client contracts spread across his desk, along with legal documents and compliance certificates. Gabriel, please sit down, Richard said. Austin, can you tell me again exactly why you fired Gabriel yesterday? Austin straightened up. Dad, Gabriel doesn't contribute anything to our international client relationships. During yesterday's crucial call with the Japanese company, he just sat there doing nothing while I handled everything myself. Richard nodded slowly, then picked

After years of fertility treatments, I was finally pregnant, and my husband and I were thrilled. I've been thinking about baby names since I was 12 and had always known what I'd name my daughter. When I told my husband Ryan my choice over dinner, he stared at me for the longest time before saying, you're joking, right? I laughed because I thought he was teasing me about how long I've been planning this, but his face stayed completely serious. He asked if I had a backup name, and I said no, because this was the only name I'd ever wanted for a daughter. Ryan rubbed his temples like he had a headache and said, well, if you're absolutely sure, but he looked physically uncomfortable saying it. When I asked what was wrong with the name, he just shook his head and changed the subject. The next day, I told my mom over lunch, and she literally spit out her coffee. She started coughing, and when she finally caught her breath, she asked if Ryan and I were having problems. I said, no, everything was perfect, and she said, then why would you do that to your baby? I asked her what she meant, and she just kept shaking her head, saying she couldn't believe I was serious. She left the restaurant without finishing her meal. My sister had an even worse reaction. When I told her at our weekly coffee date, she immediately Pulled out her phone and started typing something, then showed me the screen asking if that's how I was planning to spell it. When I confirmed the spelling, she said oh my god, you're actually serious and started crying actual tears. She begged me to reconsider but wouldn't tell me why except to say the baby would never forgive me. I spent hours on the internet searching for anything problematic about the name. I checked if it meant something offensive in other languages or something, but nothing came up except normal stuff about it being a traditional name with Welsh origins. There was nothing that explained why everyone was acting like I'd chosen to name my baby something horrible. At my baby shower, my aunt asked what name we'd picked and the whole room went silent when I told them. My cousin actually gasped and my mother in law left the room. My best friend Stella pulled me aside and said please tell me you're pranking everyone because this isn't funny anymore. When I insisted I was serious, she said I needed professional help and left the party early. I posted in three different parenting forums asking if there was something wrong with the name and every single response assumed I was trolling. The moderators deleted my posts and banned me from two of the forums for creating drama with obvious rage bait. One person private messaged me saying if I was serious I should be reported. My co workers Found out when someone saw my list of baby names on my desk with only one name written on it. By lunch, everyone in the office was whispering and giving me strange looks. People stopped talking when I walked by, and someone had clearly been crying in the bathroom. Nobody would sit with me in the break room anymore. My boss called me into his office that afternoon and said several people had filed complaints about feeling uncomfortable. He said my joke about the baby name was creating a hostile work environment, and if I didn't stop telling people I was planning to use that name, he'd have to take disciplinary action. I tried to explain it wasn't a joke, but he cut me off and said, nobody believes you're actually going to name a baby that. I begged my husband to tell me what was wrong, but he just said if I couldn't see it myself, then maybe it was better I didn't know. When I went into labor, the admitting nurse asked for the baby's name for the paperwork, and her whole demeanor changed when I told her. She excused herself and came back with two other nurses who all stared at me like I was insane. One of them asked if I was sure I'd heard the name correctly from somewhere, and maybe I was confused.

While my mother was literally in labor with me, my grandmother on my dad's side announced, I'm cutting you both out of my life. My other son's wife is rich and can support my retirement. Your wife is a lazy food stamp collector whose hair disgusts me. Dad's mouth dropped before his jaw clenched with anger. Get the hell out if you're gonna be racist to my wife. My grandmother backed up like she was offended. It's not racist. It's the truth. Your brother's wife is the best thing that's happened to us. She looked at my dad like he was a naive child when he said that finding real love was the best thing that happened to him. Good luck on your real love. Don't come crawling back when she's framed you for a theft you didn't do. She left the delivery room booking flight tickets off her other daughter in law's credit card. I wasn't there to see it, but my grandmother's actions lit a fire inside my parents. Mom threw herself into teaching when I got a little older, and dad picked up extra shifts at the warehouse. When I was 7, Mom and dad had saved enough to start an after school program. Mom tutored while dad taught life skills like fixing cars or how to DIY insulate your walls. Soon, 50 kids had started showing up. Meanwhile, my grandmother was living with my Uncle and his wife Annette, going on holidays, spending her money, buying new cars just because she could. But there was something neither of the families knew. Turns out Annette had been in that delivery room when I was born. She'd stood silently in the doorway. And hearing her mother in law call a Newborn baby a disgrace shifted something inside her. That's when she heard about my dad's success. By now, the program had a second location. My parents were profiting enough to move to a house with a pool and take vacations where I'd get my own hotel room. That's when Annette made her move. Markets been rough lately. We're losing a lot, she casually said during a smaller than usual family dinner. Grandma's eyes instantly went wide. Soon Annette took money out of my grandmother's card, so it declined. Then grandmother's king size bed got replaced with a single. Then came the big announcement. Annette showed up to lunch crying. The lawyers say my trust fund might be frozen for years. We're going to lose everything. My grandmother's reaction was immediate. Are you seriously telling me you're going broke? Annette cried and nodded like it was true. Over the next few weeks, Grandmother's fancy clothes were sold to pay off stock losses. Her 25 dollar coffee was replaced with instant. And Annette and Richie even moved into an apartment to make a loss of money look real. That's when my grandmother finally snapped. I think I need Some space from you two while you figure things out financially. It's just so stressful for me. Just like that, she stopped coming to dinners, started ignoring Annette's calls. All over money that was never actually gone. That's when she remembered she had another son. I was 15 when she showed up at our door. Dad was at work, but mom was home. I'll never forget my grandmother's face when she saw our house. The mental math is visible. The pool, the two cars, my MacBook on the counter. I've been thinking about family lately, she said, clutching her knockoff designer bag. I realize I may have been hasty in the past. Mom, because she's better than anyone deserves, invited her in for coffee. My grandmother sat in our kitchen looking at the photos from our vacations, the awards from the after school program. The life we built without her. I always knew you two would make something of yourselves. She lied. I just wanted to give you space to grow. She started crying about being abandoned by both sons, how lonely she was, how family should stick together. Then came the ask. I just need a little help getting back on my feet. Maybe I could stay in your guest room, just temporarily. Dad came home during this performance. He listened. Then he spoke very quietly. You called my baby a disgrace in the delivery room while my wife was still bleeding. I was upset. I didn't mean you Meant every word. He snapped. And you know how Anata is supposedly going? Broke. Grandmother's ears perked up. How do you know that? She asked. My dad just smirked. How do you know that? Brothers talk, mom, he finally said. He walked around visibly enjoying her panic. You. You know that Annette's trust fund was never frozen? Grandmother's jaw dropped. What do you mean? She asked, scared to hear the answer. Annette is a smart woman, mom. She knows you only loved her money, so she put you to the test. My grandmother turned white. That's not possible. But even she wasn't believing her own words. Annette can buy you a Bentley at the snap of a finger. But now she never will. And you'll never see a cent off me, either. Now get out of my house. Grandmother turned desperate. Please, I'm your mother. You can't just. You're right.

Okay, this is exactly why your ex boyfriend broke up with you. You're such a freaking control freak, my sister Ellen groaned as she slammed her hand on my color coded binder. Our parents 30th anniversary only happens once. It needs to be perfect, I explained, pushing her hands away from my binder. Perfect, she laughed. You made me call 20 vendors for quotes. I. I missed my boyfriend's birthday dinner to taste test cakes with you, dude. Literally like mom and dad don't care about whether the napkins we buy are gold or champagne. At this point, the party won't even be done on time. Ellen plopped down on the couch, completely frustrated. I sat down beside her and said gently, you don't understand. Mom mentioned she never got a real wedding reception. She just rolled her eyes and gave a sour expression. Oh my god, you're always like this. You're so obsessive over details. This is why no one wants to do anything with you anymore, she ranted, delivering the final blow. Why can't you just chill and keep things simple for once? I stared at my binder with all its tabs and highlights and detailed notes. Then I shoved it aside, watching papers scatter across the floor. Fine. Want simple? Let's just throw something together. Her face lit up immediately. Finally, thank you. So I went simple, really simple. Instead of invitations, I opened up Facebook and created an event surprise party for mom and Dad's 30th anniversary. I set it to public and hit create. Done in 30 seconds and everything else went the same way. Decorations, dollar store and target. Doesn't matter if the colours match or not. Music, I'm sure the phone speaker will be fine. Ellen started texting me constantly about random people asking questions. I kept telling her the same thing, just choose whatever you wanted. Simple. After a while, I stopped responding all together. A week before the party, Ellen showed up at my door with bags under her eyes. She'd been up for three days straight googling how to throw anniversary party and managing RSVPs from people we didn't even know. You were supposed to help me, not completely abandon me, she said. I shrugged. I just overcomplicate things with my silly color coded binders and don't worry so much. Just chill, I told her. She stared at me for a long moment then left without another word. No stress, no spreadsheets, no calling vendors at midnight, just like she wanted. The day before the party, we met at the venue to set up. My sister stood in the middle of an empty room with random decorations gathered on a folding table. A crooked Happy Anniversary banner hung from one wall. This is bad. This is really, really bad. She panicked. Her phone buzzed with a cake confirmation. She opened it and smiled for a second at least. The cake will be nice. Triple chocolate fudge, their favorite. I couldn't hide my shocked expression. Her face scrunched up, looking even more worried. What? What's wrong now? It's just Dad's allergic to chocolate, I told her. All the color from her face drained instantly. What? Since when? Since forever, Ellen? He breaks out in hives. How was I supposed to know that? You never told me. She started pacing around the room. Oh, my god. What else don't I know? Mom's favorite, flowers. Their first dance song, Yellow Roses at last by Edda James and.

I don't have to settle for you anymore, I replied. I respect your choice. Then I focused on his younger brother, who'd been watching from the stairs. My stepson's reaction when he realized I wouldn't fight for him was priceless. Joshua and I had been father and son for 10 years. Started when he was 7. Already taught him to ride a bike, throw a baseball, tie a tie. Then Rick messaged him. His real dad, who vanished when Joshua was 3, left his mom crying with an eviction notice. Never paid a dime in child support. My real dad is back, and I choose him, Joshua says, crossing his arms. You were just a placeholder, a substitute, until the real thing showed up. 10 years of baseball practices, homework help, teaching him to drive, and he's calling me a placeholder to my face. Okay, I respect your choice, I said calmly. He looked shocked. That's it? You're not going to fight for me? You just told me I was a placeholder. What's there to fight for? Charlie came down the stairs and hugged me tight. It's okay, dad, he whispered. Rick showed up Saturday in a rented BMW. Walked in like he owned my house. Joshua packed his bag, practically glowing with excitement. Rick made more big promises while Joshua loaded the car. Rick promised Joshua a car for his birthday, college money, making up for lost time. Charlie watched from the kitchen. Window. You okay with this? Charlie asked. After they left, Joshua made his choice. Wanna build that bookshelf we've been planning? We spent Saturday afternoon in the garage, just Charlie and me. Measuring wood, sanding edges. Charlie actually laughing at my bad jokes. Joshua came back Sunday night with shopping bags. Rick bought him new Jordans, an iPhone 15, AirPods Pro, designer clothes. Charlie showed Joshua our bookshelf. Check out what dad and I made. Joshua barely looked at it. Too busy texting Rick about next weekend's plans. The following Friday was Charlie's debate tournament. Joshua announced he was going to Rick's beach house instead. Have fun with your substitute son, Joshua said to me. Charlie heard everything, but pretended he didn't. I sat front row for Charlie's tournament. He won third place out of 30 kids. We celebrated at his favorite burger place. Posted the trophy photo online. Joshua never congratulated him. Rick lasted three weeks before the first cancellation. Sorry, buddy. Work emergency came up. Can't make your birthday dinner. Rain check. Joshua's face fell, but he made excuses immediately. He's busy building his business empire. He's got important meetings. I'll celebrate on my own. We saw Joshua sitting alone at McDonald's when I took Charlie. Just wanted something quick. Joshua lied. When we walked over, Charlie tried to hug his brother. Joshua pushed him away. I don't need your pity. The pattern became predictable. Rick promised Thanksgiving in Miami. Canceled that morning with a text. Christmas skiing, In Aspen with the family. Sorry, kid. Girlfriend doesn't want kids along. New Year's Eve in Times Square. Something came up. Maybe next year. Joshua spent holidays in his room while Charlie and I cooked Mom's traditional recipes. Charlie asked about donating

I replied, follow your heart. Then I became a private pilot for a rich family. My girlfriend's reaction when she saw me at Christmas dinner with my new fiance was to die for. Maggie and I had been together three years. I was planning to propose on New Year's Eve. Already had the ring and her mom's blessing. Then Bennett texted her. My older brother, the surgeon who saved life Ives and drove a Tesla, who made our parents proud at every family gathering while I fixed computers for barely enough to cover rent. I think we need to talk, she says, not looking up from her phone. Bennett and I have been talking. He's everything I need in my life right now. Three years of supporting her through her yoga certification, her anxiety attacks, everything, and she wants to throw it away for my own brother. Follow your heart, Maggie, I said quietly. She looked shocked. You're not going to fight for me? You just told me you want my brother. What's there to fight for? She met Bennett that Saturday at his penthouse. Came home Sunday morning, hair perfect, wearing his Yale hoodie, smelling like his expensive Cologne. We just talked about the future. She lied to my face. Here's what Maggie didn't know. I'd already suspected something. Bennett always found excuses to text her, always sat next to her at family dinners, always offered to drive Her home when I was working late. Dad called Tuesday. Bennett told us the good news. We're so happy for them. Your brother deserves someone special. Three years I've been with Maggie, and I was invisible. Three months of Bennett texting her, and suddenly they're planning our family's future. You'll find someone, son. Not everyone can be. Bennett wanted to scream. I wanted to tell him about the ring. Instead, I hung up. Thursday, I drove past the small airport near my apartment. Sign said, first flying lesson free. Why not? Nothing left to lose. The instructor was a retired airline pilot. You look like you need to be somewhere that isn't here, he said. I laughed for the first time in a week. Up in that Cessna, nothing else mattered. Not Maggie, not Bennett, not my parents. Disappointment. Just me in the sky. I got home to find Maggie Pack. Bennett helped carry her boxes. Nice place, he said, looking around my studio apartment. It's small, though. Maggie deserves better. I didn't respond. Just watch them load her things into his Tesla. Flying became my escape. Every paycheck went to lessons. The instructor introduced me to his rich clients who needed private pilots. Within six months, I had my commercial license, started flying tech executives to meetings. One client, Christian, took interest in me. You remind me of myself before Microsoft, he said. Smart, but overlooked. He offered me investment opportunities, small stakes and start UPS. His fund was Backing? I put everything I had into them. Ramen dinners and a mattress on the floor. But I had equity in three companies. Maggie tried reaching out. After a year, saw on LinkedIn you're a pilot now. That's cute. Bennett says hi. I didn't respond. I was too busy flying Christian to an acquisition meeting where one of my

I'm Casey, and my twin sister is Katie. Yeah, our parents really thought they were being cute with those names. Did everything possible to make sure we were basically the same person our entire lives. We shared a bed until I was 18. Not just a room. The same bed. Every night. Katie would wrap her arms around me like I was her teddy bear, and I'd lie there awake, wanting to scream. When I tried to sleep on the floor, she'd cry until her parents made me get back in bed with her. School was a nightmare. Our parents demanded we be in every single class together. Same desk, partner for group projects, same lunch table, same everything. Teachers would literally call us the twins instead of our actual names. Katie loved it. She'd introduce us by saying, we're Katie and Casey, and answer questions meant for me. The worst part was friends. If someone invited me to hang out, Katie automatically assumed she was invited, too. She'd show up wherever I was supposed to meet people. This girl Emma from my chemistry class asked me to study together once, and Katie just appeared at the library with all her books. Emma never asked me to study again. When I was 14, I got really sick with some stomach thing and had to stay in the hospital for two nights. Katie Had a complete meltdown because she couldn't stay with me. She sat in the parking lot crying for hours until security made our parents take her home. Those two nights alone were the first time I'd slept peacefully in years. No one breathing in my face or stealing my blankets or asking me what I was thinking about every five minutes. I started planning my escape junior year. Katie thought we were going to the same college and being roommates forever. Our parents had already called the admissions office trying to make sure we'd be placed together. I applied to different schools without telling anyone. I got into this community college three states away and saved up money from my part time job at the grocery store. The day after graduation, I told them I wasn't going to college. Katie freaked out, asking what we were going to do instead. Not what I was going to do. What we were going to do. That's when I knew I had to get out immediately. I packed my stuff while they were at dinner. Just threw everything into trash bags and left. My friend Jess let me crash at her place for two weeks. Then we both moved to start college together. I blocked everyone's numbers and social media. For three months. I had peace. I could eat what I wanted for breakfast. I could watch whatever show I liked. I could make friends without someone else inserting themselves into every conversation. It was amazing. But I felt guilty. So I unblocked Katie's number. Big mistake. She'd been calling and texting non stop for months. Hundreds of messages. Some angry, some sad, some just saying she missed me.

Within two weeks, Emma had new friends asking to join our weekend adventures. Girls who were tired of just staring at screens wanted to come camping, learn to bake, go on photo walks around town. The turning point came during our third weekend camping trip. We had four girls with us roasting marshmallows and telling ghost stories. That's when Zoe showed up at our campsite with her mom.

Then Emma smiled and handed Zoe a marshmallow. Want To hear the scary story Rachel was telling, Zoe sat down, putting her phone in her pocket.

I woke up that morning already knowing I was in trouble. My alarm had betrayed me again. And when I checked my phone, I felt my stomach drop. I had exactly seven minutes to get to school. Seven minutes to get out of bed, get dressed, grab my stuff, and somehow teleport to class. And I had no choice. Had nine tardies already. One more. And I wasn't just late, I was looking at a full week of detention. I threw on my clothes so fast I didn't even match, grabbed my backpack and bolted out the door. My legs were moving before my brain even caught up. By some miracle, I made it to school right at 8. The problem? The front doors were already closed. If I walked in now, they Mark me late. No matter what, I'd be trapped in detention for an entire week. There had to be another way in. That's when I saw it. The fence. A 10 foot shortcut between me and a clean attendance record. Never climbed it before. I had no idea if I could. But at that moment, it was the only option. I looked around. No teachers, no security. Just me and the best worst idea I'd ever had. I took a deep breath and ran. The moment my hands grabbed the top of the fence, I knew I was committed. I pulled myself up, swung one leg over, and my belt. Loop hooked onto the metal. I didn't realize what had happened at first. I tried to jump down. Nothing. Tried again. Still stuck. Then I looked down. My feet weren't touching the ground. I was dangling, hanging midair, completely helpless. My backpack slid off and hit the ground. My shirt rode up to my stomach. And then the worst possible sound. Laughter. I twisted around. A few students had seen me, then a few more, then a crowd. Phones were already out. I started flailing, trying to get free. Instead, I spun in a slow, pathetic circle. That's when I heard the voice. Do you need some help, bud? I turned my head and saw him, the school cop, arms crossed, trying way too hard not to laugh. I didn't answer. I just sighed, accepting my fate. It took three people to unhook me, but I finally hit the ground. My belt was ripped in half. My dignity gone forever.

So my roommate Derek always did this thing whenever we went out with our friend group. He'd order like he was at his own birthday party, then casually suggest we split everything evenly to make it easier on the server. This has been going on for over a year. Every Saturday night, same routine. Derek would get multiple appetizers for the table. Nobody asked for order the priciest entree, extra drinks, dessert, sometimes even a second dessert. The rest of us would get normal meals and end up paying for his feast. We all complained about it privately, but nobody wanted to cause drama since we all lived in the same apartment complex and hung out constantly. Last weekend was different, though. Our friend group was celebrating Lisa getting into law school, so we decided to go somewhere nice instead of our usual sports bar. There were six of us total, including Lisa's new boyfriend, Mike, who'd never experienced Derek's dining habits before. A restaurant was upscale Italian, cloth napkins, dim lighting, the kind of place where breadsticks aren't free. Lisa told everyone to order whatever they wanted since this was a special Celebration and we could all afford to splurge a little. For once, everyone started ordering reasonably. I got chicken Parmesan for 22 dollars. Most people went for pasta dishes in the 18 to 25 dollar range. Lisa got the salmon since it was her Night Mike ordered spaghetti and meatballs, seemed careful about the price even though he was an engineering student with good internship money. But Derek, Man, Derek saw this as his golden opportunity. First, he orders the veal osso buco, the 45 dollar dish that comes with a warning about the preparation time. Then he adds the truffle risotto as his side for another 18 dollars. Before anyone can process that, he's telling our server, let's start with your antipasto platter for the table, a 35 dollar appetizer nobody requested. I'm watching our server write this down while everyone else just sits there. Stunt Mike looks like he's calculating his monthly budget in his head. Throughout dinner, Derek keeps ordering two glasses of their premium wine at $16 each, extra breadsticks that cost $8, some fancy olive oil for dipping. He even orders their signature tiramisu that serves two people for $24. The whole time he's talking about his crypto investments, how he just got a promotion at the marketing firm, maybe buying a new gaming setup, really laying it thick about his financial success lately. When the server brings the check, Derek immediately grabs it before anyone else can see. Whoa, guys, this got a little out of hand, he says, doing his fake surprised face. Looks like we're at about $78 each with tip. Not bad for a place like this though, right? I watch Mike's face go pale. Lisa starts nervously fidgeting with her purse. One suddenly very Interested in their water glasses because nobody wants to be the one to object on Lisa's special night. But here's the thing Derek didn't know. Earlier that week, Mike had confided in me that he was actually planning to propose to Lisa next month. He'd been saving every penny for months, working extra shifts at his internship, even selling his old textbooks to afford the ring he'd already picked out. So when Derek casually dropped that $78.

I was 12 when a tornado warning Siren went off at 2 a m. Most kids never think about what their parents would actually do in a real emergency until it happens. I found out the hard way. The sirens were screaming outside our house, and I could hear the wind picking up something fierce. I've done tornado drills at school a million times. Teacher always said the same thing. Have a plan. With your family, nowhere to go, stick together. So when I heard that awful wailing sound, I did exactly what I was supposed to do. I ran straight to my parents bedroom, heart pounding in my chest. The door was already open and mom was frantically pulling clothes out of dresser drawers while dad grabbed boxes from under the bed. Grab the photo albums! Mom shouted at him, pointing to the bookshelf. What about me? I asked, standing there in my pajamas with my hair all messy from sleep. Neither one of them even looked at me. Dad rushed past me carrying our old wedding albums and some jewelry boxes. Mom was right behind him with her arms full of important papers and more pictures. I followed them downstairs, my bare feet cold on the hardwood floor. I could hear the thunder getting louder outside, and the rain was starting to hammer against the windows. The emergency radio was crackling with warnings about rotation. Spotted just a few miles Away! When we got to the basement door, mom turned around and saw me standing there. There's no more room, she snapped, like I was asking for something unreasonable. Then they shut the door right in my face. I stood there in that dark hallway alone, while the whole house shook from thunder. The sirens kept wailing. I could hear the wind outside getting stronger and stronger. It sounded like a freight train was coming straight for us. I tried knocking on the basement door, but they didn't answer. I called for them, but nothing. So I crawled under the kitchen table with Buster, our old golden retriever, and wrap my arms around him. He was shaking just as bad as I was. That's when it really hit me. If that tornado came through our neighborhood, my parents weren't going to open that door for me. I'd rather save their stupid photo albums than make sure their own daughter was safe. The storm lasted about 20 minutes, but it felt like hours. When the sirens finally stopped and the wind died down, I heard the basement door creek open. Mom and dad came upstairs looking all annoyed, like the whole thing had just been a big inconvenience. You should have knocked harder, mom said when she saw me still under the table. You could have been hurt if you came down with all that stuff, dad added, gesturing to their precious boxes. You'll thank us one day when we still Have the photo albums mom finished. But I didn't thank them. Not that night, not ever. The next week at school, missus Coleman asked our class to talk about emergency preparedness. What's something you'd grab in an emergency? She wanted to know. Kids raised

I made one rule that silenced them all. Mocking laughter hit me before I opened the door. I walked in to find five women in a circle with notebooks on my coffee table, all red faced from laughing. My wife held a handwritten list. And No. 12, she announced between giggles. He has to ask permission before buying anything over $20. The group erupted. One woman slapped her knee. Oh, look! Speak of the devil! One friend chirped. We were just discussing you, my wife beamed. We're making rules that would make marriages better. Guidelines for husbands to follow. These weren't suggestions. These were commands wrapped in female empowerment. What kind of rules? I asked calmly. They rattled off their masterpiece. Rule 1. All major decisions require wife approval. Rule 7. Daily gratitude speeches about his wife. Minimum two minutes. Rule 11. No single friends. They give ideas about freedom. Rule 18. The notebook woman read. Weekly allowance system. Spending money based on rule compliance. Good behavior rewarded, bad behavior punished. They discussed me like a child needing behavioral modification while I sat three feet away. How would you enforce these? I asked conversationally. They eagerly shared strategies. Withholding privileges, public embarrassment, financial consequences. My wife nodded. If he's stubborn, we use social pressure. Get other wives involved. Community effort. That's brilliant, I said, meaning it. They'd revealed how little they respected any man in their orbit. Before we continue, If I'm subject to 18 rules without input, I should contribute one rule of my own. Silence. I was supposed to passively receive their wisdom, not participate. What kind of rule? My wife asked cautiously. One simple rule for balance and fairness. They couldn't refuse without admitting their system was one sided. Fine, my wife said. One rule. I stood slowly. Any woman creating rules to control her husband automatically declares herself available for the same treatment from other men. Complete silence. What does that mean? My wife asked. Confidence gone. By establishing that spouses can unilaterally create binding rules, you've opened the door for reciprocal treatment. If you can make rules for me, I can make rules for you. That's not the same thing, one protested. Isn't it? You explained how husbands need structure and oversight. I'm applying that logic to wives who redesign marriages without consultation. My wife looked panicked. This was just a fun exercise. I held up their notebook of detail.

A decade later, they came crawling back. They always bragged about being self made, conveniently forgot Grandpa paid their house down payment and grandma babysat me for free while they build their careers. But when it was my turn, suddenly I needed to learn the real world. I came home from my grocery store shift on my actual 18th birthday. Found three trash bags on the porch with my entire life stuffed inside. Mom stood in the doorway, avoiding eye contact. Dad crossed his arms like a bouncer. You're an adult now, he said. Time to act like one. I asked where I was supposed to go. Mom shrugged. You'll figure something out. We did. They had help at every turn, but they rewrote history to make themselves the heroes. They handed me nothing. No emergency money, no Grace period, no forwarding address for my mail. Just good luck. And a door slamming in my face. I heard the deadbolt turn. My first call was to my aunt. She sighed and said, you know how your parents are. They're just teaching you responsibility, then hung up. Uncle laughed when I called him. Figure it out, kiddo. Every relative gave me the same line, like my parents had sent a group text. If she calls, tell her this is good for her. I slept in my car that night, parked behind a 24 hour Walmart. Cracked the windows and cried. Myself to sleep on a pile of my own clothes. The first week, I kept expecting them to cave to all and say they were sorry, that this was just a test. That call never came. My $200 savings evaporated fast. I Learned which gas stations had the cleanest bathrooms, which McDonald's wouldn't kick me out for sitting too long. I applied everywhere, but without an address, I was radioactive. Nobody wants to hire someone living in their car. The worst part wasn't the hunger or sleeping on parking lots. It was knowing I had family. A house, a bedroom with my stuff still in it. And none of it was mine anymore. A month in, I got lucky. A diner needed a dishwasher. Minimum wage, but the manager, Karen, didn't ask too many questions. She even let me use the employee bathroom to clean up, then paid me cash under the table until I got an address. I saved every penny. Rented a closet size room in a house with five other people. After months in my car, having a door that locked felt like a mansion. I missed my high school graduation because I couldn't afford the time off. Heard my name, got called to an empty chair. My parents didn't even notice I wasn't there. I tried calling them once. Six months later. Straight to voicemail. When I tried again, I realized they blocked me. I deleted their numbers and built my own life. Trade school electrician. Certification. Three years of 60 hour weeks. Started my own business at 23. By 25, I was pulling six figures and had 12 employees. My parents had no idea. Then last month, my phone buzzed. Unknown number. Hi, sweetie. It's mom. Dad's in the hospital. We really need to talk, sweetie. After eight years of silence, I was suddenly sweetie again. I should have hung up, but curiosity got the better of me. If they were reaching out now, after all this time, they must be desperate. I drove to their tiny apartment. They'd lost the house, lost everything. Dad looked 20 years older, connected to an oxygen tank. Mom had aged hard, too. Thank god you're here, she said, hugging me like we talked yesterday. We've been so worried about money. She handed me a folder thick with medical bills.

When I joined this company, I quickly noticed something that made my jaw drop. Every single employee, from the interns to the senior executives had the exact same password. Not similar passwords, the exact same one. And the username. That was just your company email address. So if you knew the login page and literally anyone's email, congratulations you. You had full access. I pointed this out early on thinking it would be fixed immediately. Instead, management brushed me off with that's not our area to be concerned about. I figured, fine, not my circus. I'll do my job and collect my paycheck. Fast forward a bit and a Windows update broke a key piece of the software I use daily. I opened a help ticket hoping I t would patch it. Instead it got escalated all the way to the CTO. His answer I don't want to waste time fixing this, just use the workaround. The workaround slowed everything down and made my job way harder, so I pushed back. His response suck it up. That pissed me off, and when I'm pissed, I get creative. So I emailed the CEO, who to be honest, was the founder's son and mostly useless. My email was short and sweet. I discovered a massive security flaw that could expose us to huge liabilities. When would be a good time to discuss this? His reply was basically what flaw? So I decided to show him. I picked two random sales people I didn't even know. Use their emails, logged into their accounts and pulled up two customers. Full profiles, addresses, personal details. Everything you'd need for identity theft. Then I attached screenshots and sent them to the CEO. My message was clear. Any disgruntled employee could do do this. One person could destroy us. Twenty five minutes later, my phone rang. It was the CEO. Suddenly, he was very interested. I walked him through it in plain English, step by step, showing him how ridiculously easy it was. He finally realized how catastrophic this could be. He asked me to present. Sent it to the entire executive team the next day. So there I was, in a conference call with the CEO, CTO, CCO, CFO, the company lawyer and a senior VP. Demonstrated the flaw. Live logging into accounts and showing customer data. Everyone's jaw dropped. Everyone agreed it was a massive issue. Everyone except the CTO. He exploded. He wanted me fired for hacking the system, claiming what I did violated the employee handbook. I calmly explained that I wasn't exploiting it, I was exposing it because I cared about protecting the company. Pointed out that even a former employee could easily log in as someone else, since the usernames were just emails and the password was the same for everyone. His defense? We can track them with IP addresses. I laughed and explained VPNs. The attorney who clearly Hadn't heard of VPNS before. Was shocked when I described how easy it would be to cover your tracks. The room was dead silent except for the CTO who was red faced and furious. The CEO cut him off and said the flaw would be fixed that day. No excuses. Meeting over afterward, the CTO called me directly. Absolutely rage.

So I was working at this hospital doing environmental services. Basically just hauling trash and medical waste around all day. Perfect job for me since I have ADHD and need to stay moving. Me and my work partner could usually clear our whole section by lunch break, which was pretty sweet. Then this new guy, Ben, started. At first he seemed cool enough, you know, just another dude trying to make some money. But after his first week, things got weird fast. I'd show up Monday morning, and the trash bins would be completely overflowing. Like, nasty food containers and medical waste just piled up everywhere. The smell was disgusting. Then Tuesday would be the same mess. And Wednesday, too. I'm talking about bins that should have been emptied three days ago, still sitting there full. Management was getting pissed because families and patients were complaining about the smell and mess. My supervisor kept pulling me aside, asking what was going on, why our section looked like a dump. I kept telling her I had no idea, but honestly, I was starting to suspect Ben wasn't doing his job. The problem was, Ben was really good at lying. Like, scary good. Whenever management asked him about the overflowing bins, he'd have some excuse ready. Oh, I thought Jake was covering that wing. Or the elevator was broken, so I couldn't get the card up there. Or my personal favorite, I cleared That yesterday someone must have dumped a bunch of stuff after I left. He was so convincing that even I started doubting myself sometimes. Maybe I was missing sections. Maybe I was forget which bins I'd already emptied. But deep down, I knew something was off, because I've been doing this job for 2 years and never had problems like this. What really got me was that I'd be busting my ass trying to catch up on all the missed work, while Ben would just disappear for hours. I'd be running around with full garbage carts, sweating like crazy. And he'd show up at the end of the day looking fresh as a daisy, talking about how tired he was from working so hard. The breaking point was when Mrs. Rodriguez in room three fourteen complained that her medical waste hadn't been picked up in four days. She had diabetes and needed her used needles disposed of safely. Having that stuff pile up was not just gross, it was dangerous. Management called us both in and basically said if this didn't get fixed, heads were gonna roll. That's when I decided to set my trap. It was a Friday afternoon, and I was doing my final rounds. I got to the pediatric wing and saw this trash bin absolutely overflowing with juice boxes, diaper wrappers and used tissues. Just gross stuff everywhere. But here's the key detail. That whole wing gets shut down on weekends. No patients, no visitors, no Staff except security. The trash situation wouldn't change at all until Monday. I pulled out my phone and took a picture of the bin from two different angles, making sure you could see the room numbers and the clock on the wall showing the time and date. Then I left it exactly as it was. Ben was scheduled to work Saturday and Sunday, so if he was actually doing his job, that bin should be empty by Monday morning. Monday rolls around and I get to work 30 minutes early. I go straight to that same bin in the pediatric wing. It was exactly the same. Same juice boxes, same tissues, even the same piece of banana peel hanging over the edge. I took another picture from the exact same angles. I marched straight to my supervisor's office and showed her both pictures. She looked at them for like 10 seconds, then her face got this really serious expression. She called Ben into the office immediately. Ben walks in all casual, probably thinking this was just another routine check in. My supervisor puts the pictures on her desk and asks Ben to explain why this bin hadn't been touched in four days. Ben starts doing his usual thing. Oh, I definitely emptied that on Saturday. And maybe someone dumped more stuff after I left. And the lighting in that picture makes it hard to tell. But then I pointed out specific pieces of trash that were in identical positions in Both photos, that banana peel hadn't moved a millimeter. The juice box with the torn straw was in the exact same spot. Was even this crumpled up tissue that had the same wrinkles. In both pictures. Ben's face went completely blank. He just sat there staring at the pictures, probably trying to come up with some new lie. But there was nothing he could say. The evidence was right there in front of him. Turns out and had been spending most of his shifts hiding in empty patient rooms, scrolling through his phone. Security footage later showed him just sitting in random places throughout the hospital doing absolutely nothing. He'd been getting paid for 40 hours a week, while maybe working five. My supervisor fired him on the spot.

I don't have to settle for you anymore, I replied. I respect your choice. Then I focused on his younger brother, who'd been watching from the stairs. My stepson's reaction when he realized I wouldn't fight for him was priceless. Joshua and I had been father and son for 10 years. Started when he was seven. Already taught him to ride a bike, throw a baseball, tie a tie. Then Rick messaged him his real dad, who vanished when Joshua was 3, left his mom crying with an eviction notice.

You were just a placeholder, a substitute, until the real thing showed up. 10 years of baseball practices, homework, help, teaching him to drive, and he's calling me a placeholder to my face. Okay, I respect your choice, I said calmly. He looked shocked. That's it? You're not going to fight for me? You just told me I was a place. Told her. What's there to fight for? Charlie came down the stairs and hugged me tight. It's okay, dad, he whispered. Rick showed up Saturday in a rented BMW. Walked in like he owned my house. Joshua packed his bag, practically glowing with excitement. Rick made more big promises while Joshua loaded the car. Rick promised Joshua a car for his birthday, college money making up for lost time. Charlie watched From the kitchen window. You okay with this? Charlie asked. After they left, Joshua made his choice. Wanna build that bookshelf we've been planning? We spent Saturday afternoon in the garage, just Charlie and me. Measuring wood, sanding edges. Charlie actually laughing at my bad jokes. Joshua came back Sunday night with shopping bags. Rick bought him new Jordans, an iPhone 15, AirPods Pro, designer clothes. Charlie showed Joshua our bookshelf. Check out what dad and I made. Joshua barely looked at it. Too busy texting Rick about next weekend's plans. The following Friday was Charlie's debate tournament. Joshua announced he was going to Rick's beach house instead. Have fun with your substitute son, Joshua said to me. Charlie heard everything, but pretended he didn't. I sat front row for Charlie's tournament. He won third place out of 30 kids. We celebrated at his favorite burger place. Posted the trophy photo online. Joshua never congratulated him. Rick lasted three weeks before the first cancellation. Sorry, buddy. Work emergency came up. Can't make your birthday dinner. Rain check? Joshua's face fell, but he made excuses immediately.

I'm 10 years old when my parents sit me down for the talk. My classmate had invited me to her birthday party at the arcade. First real party invitation ever. Mom starts crying before she even speaks. You're Chris. Goes everywhere you go. No exceptions. Chris is 8, has developmental disabilities, needs constant supervision. Dad adds, he's not disabled. He's differently abled. When we're gone, you're all he has. This is practice. I ask if just this once, I can go alone. Mom's tears get worse. So you're ashamed of him? He didn't choose this. God gave him to us for a reason. You're his guardian angel. Fine. I bring Chris to the party. The arcade lights and sounds are too much. He screams, throws himself on floor, hits anyone who comes close. The party ends after 20 minutes. Birthday girl's mom drives us home early. My best friend says, it's cool, don't worry about it. But I'm never invited anywhere again. Can't join soccer team because practice is when Chris has therapy. Can't do sleepovers because Chris can't be without our parents overnight. Family means nobody gets left behind. Mom says, if you can't include him, maybe you shouldn't go either. I'm 18 now. College acceptance letter arrives. Mom immediately asks if they have good programs for Chris. I pick local community college instead. Chris sits in back of every class humming. When I'm 22, first job, Interview at a bank. Chris comes, start screaming his lungs out. I don't get Job. 25, my first date, Chris comes to dinner. He throws food because the texture feels wrong. My date leaves before the appetizer. By 28, I haven't been alone in 18 years. Co worker invites me to a wedding. RSVP for two. Co worker calls back, actually, we're keeping it small. One day, the doctor mentions Chris seems stressed at check up. Suggest a day program with professionals. Parents shut it down immediately. Strangers won't love him like family. Chris starts hitting himself when frustrated. Mom blames me. You're not being patient enough. My therapist friend pulls me aside at the grocery store, says Chris show signs of oversimulation. Might need professional structure. Parents over here. That therapist just wants our money. Stop being selfish. He only has you. I'm 34 when mom gets cancer diagnosis. Two months later, dad has a massive heart attack from stress. I become caregiver for all three. Mom grabs my hand from the hospital bed. Promise you'll never put your Chris in a home. Promise. I promise. Dad dies first. Mom, three weeks after, alone with Chris for the first time ever. He won't eat, won't shower. Hits me when I try to help. I try to call my aunt for help. She tells me I have my own family. He's your responsibility. Now. Chris stops sleeping, walks around house all night owning. Neither of us have slept in five Days the neighbors call social services. Social worker visits and watches Chris for five minutes. Has he ever been evaluated for placement? Tell her parents that he didn't need that. He's showing clear signs of needing professional care. How long has he been hurting himself? I say years. But our parents said it was normal. She pulls up a tablet and plays some videos. There. The resident at the hospital doing art, another cooking, laughing with staff, having friends. Your Chris could have been in our program 20 years ago. He qualified. I can't breathe. They said strangers wouldn't love him. I tell her the social worker looks at me like I'm the slow one. He needed structure and professionals. Her parents weren't helping him. They were keeping him dependent. I signed the papers for Chris's placement. Aunt shows up screaming. Your parents bodies aren't even cold. You're spitting on their graves. I tell her they were wrong. He needed help they couldn't give. Family meeting gets called. Cousins, aunts, uncles, all in Mom's living room. Uncle stands up. Your parents sacrificed everything for him. I actually laugh. No, they sacrificed me for him. And him for their own guilt. Cousin tries next. At least try to keep him. I look at them all. He's not a dog. He's a human being. I tried for 24 years. I'm done. My first visit after Chris goes into the hospital goes well. Staff member mentions casually he hasn't hit himself once since Arrival. Chris made a friend, another resident who likes his same movie. He's the happiest I'd ever seen him. Now I'm taking my first vacation ever.

She showed up at my workplace, stood outside for two hours while my coworkers sent pictures from the windows. She threatened to expose my emotional abuse on social media, then started a blog called surviving narcissistic abuse with paid subscriptions. She tried accessing my bank accounts using my personal information, but couldn't answer the security questions. I'd used fake answers for exactly this reason. During the divorce hearing, she wore a white pantsuit, like attending a Celebration. Her lawyer argued I'd emotionally abandoned her. The judge asked, so your client lied to her employer, committed adultery, attempted fraud, and harassed the plane, but he's the problem. Jasmine said, your honor, you don't understand the emotional violence. I understand you used a shared credit card for hotel rooms with your affair partner. What am I missing? Divorce granted. Clean split per the prenup. She got nothing except an 8,700 dollar legal Bill. Outside the courthouse, she finally told her mother, just stop. It's over.

Let me tell you how my wife's divorce lawyer literally quit mid trial when he realized who I really was. Sarah and I met at a tech conference. She was a pharmaceutical sales rep. Gorgeous, making six figures. I just graduated law school, but was burnt out doing IT consulting instead. When she said she could never date a lawyer, they're all soulless sharks, I just didn't mention passing the bar. Stupid, yes. But she was perfect, and I was actually happy fixing computers. Eight years later, I'm in my home office when I hear giggling from our bedroom. Sarah's working from home. I walk in. She's on Facetime with someone named Marcus, wearing lingerie I'd never seen. Don't worry, baby. The divorce papers are already drafted. My idiot husband thinks I'm at pharmaceutical conferences. He's too dumb to check credit card statement. I stood there, invisible in my own doorway as my wife explained how she'd been meeting Marcus at conferences for two years using my business credit card. The kicker? Marcus was her divorce attorney. I said nothing, downloaded everything. Bank records showing $89,000 in conference expenses. All romantic getaways with Marcus, her secret apartment lease, the hidden account with my forged signature. She filed for divorce the next week, citing emotional neglect because I worked too much. Marcus personally served me Papers at my office. Smirking. Sarah says you're going to try representing yourself. That's adorable. I graduated Yale Law. Interesting, I said. Sarah posted constantly about her brilliant attorney boyfriend who is going to destroy my loser ex who thinks he's smart because he can build computers. First hearing, the judge asked if I had representation. Marcus actually laughed. He fixed his laptops. Your honor, this will be quick. I stood up. I'll be repre transcribing myself. Sarah Stage whispered, this is so embarrassing. He probably watched YouTube videos. I opened my briefcase. First document, my active bar license. Second, Mark Marcus's bar complaints. Three ethical violations I'd research. Third, evidence of their affair starting when he was technically her attorney before separation. Your honor, I move to disqualify opposing council for ethical violations under Rule 1.7. Conflict of interest involving romantic relations with a client. The judge's eyebrows shut up. Marcus went pale. Additionally, I'm filing a bar complaint for misappropriation of marital fund, as Mr. Marcus knowingly benefited from my wife's theft of $89,000 while advising her on asset. Sarah screamed, you're not a real lawyer! I pulled out my law school diploma. Yale Law, same class as Marcus. He'd been two ranks below me. Actually, Sarah, I graduated summa cum laude. Marcus here barely passed the bar exam. Third attempt, right, Marcus? Marcus stood. I, I need to withdraw from this case. The judge sit down, Mr. Marcus. We're just getting started. I presented everything. The forged Documents, the hidden asset. Marcus's emails coaching Sarah on hiding money, their texts mocking me, her social media.

I was sitting in the corner booth of the restaurant where I've been working for two years, finally taking my first break after seven hours of work. My noise canceling headphones were playing some podcast about true crime while I picked up my employee meal of leftover chicken. Then out of nowhere, something yanked my head sideways so hard I thought someone was attacking me. Pain shot through my left ear as the headphones got ripped off and I spun around to see Mister Guillermo, the owner, red faced and holding my headphones like he was about to spike them. I've been calling you for five effing minutes! He screamed, and before I could even process what was happening, he slammed my 150 dollar headphones onto the tile floor. The crack echoed through the restaurant. Every customer stopped eating and watched this 60 year old man tower over me while I sat there touching my ear, feeling something warm and wet. Then I realized my ear was actually bleeding from where the headphone pad had torn the skin. Get back to work now! Guillermo roared, and I just sat there in fear and shock. I'm on my break, I managed to say, still touching my bleeding ear, showing him the red on my fingers. I've been here since 5 this morning opening the place and this is literally my first break. Guillermo's face got even Redder, which I didn't think was possible. That's it! I've had enough of your attitude. You're fired! Get out! The words hit me like a second slap, and I stood up slowly, aware that every single customer in the restaurant was staring at us. You're firing me? I asked, genuinely confused. I hired every single person working in this kitchen right now. I've been doing the scheduling for six months. I open the restaurant every morning and close it three nights a week. I've been doing the manager's job ever since he quit. And you never replaced him? The ammo just crossed his arms. I don't need you. Plenty of people want to work here. That's when something inside me snapped. This man had been paying me $16 an hour to basically run his entire restaurant while he collected the profits. And now he was firing me after physically assaulting me in front of witnesses because I took a break I was legally entitled to. I look down at my shattered headphones on the floor, then at the red on my hand, then at the 15 or so customers still watching this train wreck unfold, and I made a decision. You need to pay for my headphones, I said comically. They were $150. Guillermo actually laughed in response. Oh, really? What will happen if I don't? Will you sue me? He said, turning to walk away. That's when I raised my voice. Not yelling, but loud enough for everyone to Hear clearly. That's exactly what I'll do. I turned to address the dining room directly. Excuse me, everyone. I'm very sorry you had to witness this, but as you just saw, my boss physically assaulted me, damaged my property, and terminated me illegally while I was on a protected break. If any of you would be willing to provide a witness statement about what you just saw, I would be extremely grateful. If you need to leave, I'll be here for the next few minutes collecting contact information. Pulled out my phone and opened a new note. I know this is uncomfortable, but I need evidence of what just happened here. The color drained from Mister Guillermo's face as an older woman immediately stood up and walked over to me, pulling out her phone. I actually recorded the whole thing. Honey, that was absolutely disgraceful. Two college girls came over next, then a man in a business suit. Then even more people forming a line while Mister Guillermo stood there looking like he'd been punched in the gut. Wait, wait! Let's talk about this! Mister Guillermo stammered, trying to push through the crowd gathering around me. But I kept taking names and phone numbers while people described what they'd seen. I was just stressed. The lunch rush was crazy. I didn't mean

My sister showed up at my house, closing with a cease and desist letter demanding I can't buy any property with more than two bedrooms because she was the only one allowed to host family events. She said, you need to walk away from this house right now because I've been the family host for eight years, and you're not taking that from me. The real estate agents exchanged confused glances as my sister said, this house has a pool and a guest suite, which means you're trying to steal my role is the family gathering place. I'm buying this house to live in because my apartment lease is up. I said, either you buy a smaller house or you sign a legal document promising never to host a single family event here, she said, pulling out a notarized contract. I've already told everyone that all family gatherings happen at my house forever. The title company's lawyer said this was the most unhinged thing he'd seen in 30 years, especially since I'd specifically told my family I hated hosting and just wanted a home office. Two weeks after I moved in anyway, she called an emergency family meeting where she discussed the psychological damage I was causing her by owning a larger house. She'd hired her friend to dress as a therapist to testify that my house purchase was sibling abuse designed to undermine her identity, and she demanded our parents force me to Sell immediately. She even filed complaints with the city claiming my house couldn't legally host gatherings, then tried to get my homeowners insurance canceled by saying I was running an illegal event venue. Our mom reminded her that I'd never hosted a single family event in my entire life, she kept screaming about how my dining room was stealing her purpose. Unfortunately for her, nobody took her seriously. I bought my house and even sent her a video of it. Well, a week later she showed up during my quiet housewarming with three friends driving a construction excavator she'd rented. She'd brought lumber and a crew to build a mother in law suite on my property that would technically be hers. Telling my confused friends any events here would still be at her house. She started digging a foundation in my backyard and when I called the police, she chained herself to the excavator, screaming she'd die before letting me steal her hosting crown, even though I kept explaining I didn't want to host anything. The crew left, but she kept digging until she hit a gas line and the fire department had to evacuate the whole neighborhood. She broke into my house while I was at work and started mixing industrial chemicals in every room to prove the house was uninhabitable for gatherings I never planned to have. She poured ammonia and bleach together there to show the ventilation was dangerous for large groups, but the fumes got So toxic she started vomiting blood and couldn't find her way out. She poured concrete down the drains to prove the plumbing couldn't handle party traffic, but the lie ate through her skin to the bone. She tried to short circuit the electrical panel, but electrocuted herself so badly her heart stopped twice. She set fire to the guest room curtains, but the accelerant splashed back and she caught fire, giving herself third degree burns over 40% of her body. The paramedics found her after she'd given herself permanent brain damage from the toxic fumes and chemical

Senior year was supposed to be perfect. I had a 4.0 GPA, early admission to Columbia with a scholarship, and was finally ready to focus on college after years of taking care of my sick grandma. Then boom! Principal's office, 8:00am on a Tuesday. Missus Blake sat there with her arms crossed, looking like I'd personally offended her entire bloodline. Amira, someone used your school email to send the chemistry test answers to the whole class. Care to explain? My stomach dropped. I stared at the screen, showing an email from my account that I definitely didn't send. The time stamp said yesterday at two forty seven PM. I was in the library bathroom then. But how do you prove that I didn't send this? I said. But she was already shaking her head. Your scholarship is suspended pending investigation. Academic integrity violation. I walked out feeling like my entire future just got flushed down the toilet. Four years of perfect grades gone. Columbia gone. Everything I worked for while watching grandma take her meds and helping her shower. All for nothing. But then I got to lunch and saw my three best friends, Maya, Danny, and Lex, huddled at our usual table. They took one look at my face and knew something was seriously wrong. Someone hacked my email, I explained. They're saying I sent test answers to everyone. Maya immediately pulled out her phone. That's bullshit. You were with us after school. Yesterday. And I know you left your laptop in the library when you went to pee. Let's. I remember that. You asked me to watch it. That's when Danny got that look in her eyes. The same look she gets before she does something slightly illegal but totally justified. We're gonna figure this out. They started a group chat that night called justice for Amira and went full detective mode. Lex remembered exactly when I left my laptop, 2:45 p m. Right before the email was sent, Maya called her friend Josh, whose dad works on the school board, and asked about security cameras in the library. There's footage. She texted the group. Josh can get it. The next day, they ditched their study hall and met Josh at his house. His dad wasn't home, but Josh had access to the school security system through some sketchy app. They fast forward and through two hours of boring library footage until they saw me get up and leave my seat. Then three minutes later, someone else sat down at my laptop. Pause it. Maya said. Zoom in. The figure was blurry at first, but when they enhanced it, they could clearly see who it was. Briel Fucking Hamilton. The girl who'd been second in our class since freshman year and always gave me dirty looks and AP chemistry. But here's the kicker. Briel is Principal Blake's niece. Her mom and Mrs. Blake are sisters. No wonder Blake was so quick to Blame you. Like, said she's protecting family. Instead of marching into school and causing drama, they did something smart. Danny's mom knew a lawyer who handled education cases. They showed her the footage, the email time stamps, and my phone location data proving I was in the bathroom when the email was sent. The lawyer told them exactly what to do. Document everything, get witness statements, build a case. So they did. Maya got Josh to officially request the security footage. Danny found three people who saw me in the bathroom at 2:47. Lex printed out my phone's location history. They even got the login records from the IT department showing someone else had accessed my account. Two weeks later, at the monthly school board meeting, they presented a folder with everything. Not to missus Blake to the entire board. The whole room went silent as they played the security footage on the projector. You could literally see Brielle typing on my laptop while I was gone. The time stamp matched the email.

I was 10 when my birthday party became the reason my parents lost me forever. They promised it would be different this year. After forgetting my ninth birthday completely, they swore they'd make it up to me. Invite five friends, mom said. We'll handle everything else. I spent the whole morning decorating our backyard by myself. Made these crappy paper signs that said happy birthday Jason in crayon, set up plastic chairs in a circle around our picnic table. I even found streamers in the garage from some party years ago and hung them up. My friends started showing up around noon with wrapped presents and confused looks. Tommy came first, then Alex, then Kevin and his little brother. They kept looking around like they were missing something obvious. Where's the cake? Tommy asked. So we've been playing tag for, like, 20 minutes. I smiled and tried to sound confident. My mom's bringing it. She went to get the good kind from the bakery downtown. But an hour passed. No food, no music, no parents anywhere. The boys were getting restless, digging through our kitchen cabinets looking for snacks. I found a bag of stale chips and some crackers, but that was it. When are they coming back? Alex asked, checking his watch. Soon, I kept saying. They said they'd be back before noon. It was almost three in the afternoon. That's when Kevin's mom showed up early to pick him up. She walked into our backyard and found me sitting alone under the tree, watching my friends kick a soccer ball around. Hey, sweetie, is your mom inside? She went to get the cake, I mumbled, not looking at her. Did she call you? No, but she said she'd be back before noon. The look on her face told me everything. She pulled out her phone and ordered pizza for all of us. When the boys asked about cake, he helped me cut up an old granola bar into tiny pieces and stuck birthday candles in them. Make a wish, she said softly. At 4:30, my parents finally pulled up in dad's truck. They were laughing about something, stumbling a little as they got out. I could smell the beer from where I stood. Relax, kiddo. Dad chuckled when he saw Kevin's mom giving them a look. We figured they'd have fun without us hovering around. He's 10 years old, Kevin's mom said firmly. You left him alone for four hours? You don't need babysitting at 10. Right, buddy? Mom added, ruffling my hair like nothing happened. They never apologized. They never thanked Kevin's mom for staying. They just went inside and turned on the TV like it was any other day. That night, I opened my presents alone in my room. Five gifts from friends who cared more about my birthday than my own parents did. I didn't even bother with the granola bar candles. There was no point. Two Weeks later, Kevin's mom called child services. Turns out she'd taken pictures of me sitting alone, of the empty house, of my parents stumbling drunk out of their truck.

What was it like to come home? Coming back from two deployments in Afghanistan was nothing like I pictured. I had it all mapped out in my head during those long nights overseas. My son Elijah running straight into my arms, yelling daddy like in some cheesy movie. My wife, Emma, crying happy tears. The whole perfect homecoming scene. Reality hit different when I opened our front door after three years away. Elijah took one look at me and hid behind his mom. This kid I left as a three year old toddler was now six, and I was a complete stranger to him. That first night was brutal. Emma tried so hard to make everything seem normal. She cooked my favorite spaghetti and meatballs, laughed at my terrible jokes, telling Elijah to give daddy a hug. But every hug felt forced. Every smile looked painted on. And my boy wouldn't even call me dad. He called me Caleb like I was some random guy who showed up at dinner. Then next few days showed me just how much I'd missed. Emma had Learned to fix the leaky bathroom faucet herself. She knew how to jump start the car when the battery died. She helped Elijah with his math homework every night and knew exactly how he liked his peanut butter sandwiches. Cut. He didn't need me anymore. She built a whole life without me. But the worst part was watching Elijah around me. When I accidentally Knocked over a glass of juice and raised my voice, saying, damn it. He flinched like I was going to hit him. When I offered to read him a bedtime story, he asked for mom instead. I tried to help him with his shoelaces. He said he could do it himself and ran to his room. For two weeks, I felt like a ghost haunting my own house. Emma would make polite conversation about my day. Elijah would give me those awkward side hugs when she told him to. We'd eat dinner together, but nobody really talked. I started wondering if maybe I should have just stayed overseas. And one Tuesday morning, I noticed something weird. Elijah never sat in the middle of our couch anymore. He always perched right on the edge like he was ready to run. And he kept glancing at the front door every few minutes, even during his favorite cartoons. That's when it hit me. Like a punch to the gut. This kid had spent three years terrified that his dad might never come home. Every day wondering if today would be the day he got bad news. And now that I was back, he was scared I might disappear again. Plus, the guy who came back wasn't the same dad who left. I jumped when the microwave beeped. I checked all the door locks twice before sitting down. I woke up in cold sweats from nightmares I couldn't explain. My son was dealing with His own kind of trauma. And I'd been too wrapped up in my own hurt feelings to see it. So I stopped trying to jump back into being his dad. Instead, I started over. Like a stranger trying to earn a kid's trust. I asked if he wanted to go on adventures to the park. Instead of just telling him we were going. We built Lego spaceships together on the living room floor. And I let him be the boss of our creations. I asked him about school, his friends, what made him laugh instead of lecturing

Her husband just doesn't like her. My sister Michelle, has been jealous of my marriage since day one. While I'm over here living my best life with my wife, Bree, Michelle is stuck in this miserable relationship with her husband, Danny. And instead of fixing her own problems, she spends all her time trying to air down what me and Bree have built together. See, Bree has a chronic autoimmune condition that flares up randomly. Some days, she's completely fine, cooking dinner and doing laundry. Other days, she can barely get out of bed without her joints screaming. When we got married six years ago, I told her the second I could afford it, she should quit her job and focus on getting better. That day came two years later, when my tech consulting business really took off. Now Bree spends her good days taking art classes, going to physical therapy, or volunteering at the animal shelter. On her bad days, she rests like she's supposed to. And, yeah, I pick up the slack around the house when she needs me to. We have a cleaning lady come once a week, and honestly, doing dishes and making dinner isn't exactly backbreaking work. But Michelle can't stand it. Every family gathering turns into her making snide comments about how lucky Bree is. Last month at Mom's birthday dinner, I mentioned Bree was taking a pottery class. Michelle rolled her eyes so hard. I thought they'd fall out. Must be nice to have all that free time while some people work for a living, she said. The thing is, Danny makes almost as much as me. He works at the same tech company I used to work for before starting my own business. But Danny's cheap as dirt and treats Michelle like she's his employee, not his wife. She's mentioned multiple times how he never takes her on dates, how he splits every Bill down to the penny, how he won't let her quit her job at the insurance office even though she hates it. Michelle works full time, comes home to cook dinner, clean the house, and take care of their two kids while Danny sits on his laptop until bedtime. But instead of confronting her husband about being a selfish jerk, she takes it out on me and Bree. Two weeks ago was the final straw. We were at Sunday dinner at my parents house. Neither Bree nor Danny came. Bree was having a rough flare up and stayed home to rest and Danny was probably at home playing video games like usual. I casually mentioned to mom that I needed to stop by the store on my way home to grab more laundry detergent since I was doing a load of towels that night. Michelle immediately perked up like a shark smelling blood. Let me guess, Princess couldn't manage to do one load of laundry today? She said loud enough. For the whole table to hear. Mom shot her a warning look, but Michelle kept going. I worked a 10 hour shift, picked up groceries, made dinner for my family, and I still found time to throw in a load of whites. But I guess some people have different priorities. Felt my jaw clench. Bree's been on the couch all day because her joints are so swollen she can barely walk to the bathroom. But thanks for your concern. Oh, please, Michelle scoffed. She's been playing this sick card for years. Meanwhile, the rest of us, actual adults, have to handle our responsibilities whether we feel like it or not. That's when I lost it. I put my fork down and looked directly at

We're done with secrets and barriers, mom announced, removing the lock from my bedroom door with a screwdriver. No locked doors in this house, period. Open communication only. She started recording on her phone while dad stood behind her, arms crossed. Trust means transparency. The irony was incredible. I'd never given them a single reason to distrust me. Perfect grades, never missed curfew, always told them where I was going. Meanwhile, they kept their bedroom door locked every night, had a locked filing cabinet in their office, and mom literally kept her journal in a locked drawer. Dad's phone had facial recognition and a passcode, yet somehow I was the one creating barriers to trust. No locks or you can find somewhere else to live, dad added, pocketing the lock he just removed. I looked at the violated door, then at their self satisfied faces, then smiled. You're absolutely right. Doors themselves are barriers. Let's remove all of them, starting tomorrow. They actually fist bumped like they just won the parenting lottery, not realizing their privacy was about to disappear completely. The next morning, mom was on the phone with her sister at 6:00am, bragging about their breakthrough. We finally taught him that privacy is just another word for deception, she gloated. Complete transparency is the only way, dad chimed in from downstairs. Should have done this years ago. Watch how much More honest everything becomes. They moved through their morning routine completely unaware of the toolbox I was carrying. 20 minutes later, I removed my bedroom door entirely. The hinges came off easily and I stored it with the others I'd hidden behind the shed. Mom discovered this when she and to tell me about dinner plans. She stood at the empty door frame, mouth open. Where's your door? Doors can be closed even without locks, I explained. This ensures total transparency. Like you wanted. She stared at the gaping doorway for a full minute before walking away. By Tuesday, their bedroom door vanished while they were at work. They discovered this at ten PM, exhausted from their day. What did you do? Dad shouted from upstairs, ensuring family transparency. I called back. You said barriers prevent honest communication. They had to change in their walk in closet, which thankfully still had a door. The neighbor's teenage son could see into their room from his window and started telling everyone at school about my dad's Superman boxers. Wednesday, the bathroom door disappeared. Mom's scream at 5:00am woke the entire neighborhood. The bathroom door is gone. No more barriers, I reminded her. You were very clear about open communication. She hung a shower curtain across the doorway, which I immediately removed. That's just a fabric door, mom. Still a barrier. They started using the gas station bathroom down the street, telling confused cashiers their plumbing was broken. The real chaos Started Friday when Mom's book club arrived. I'd removed the powder room door that morning. Her friend went to use it, screamed when she realized as the entire living room could see her, and ran out of the house. We believe in complete transparency, I explained to the horrified group. No barriers in this house. The book club president announced they'd be meeting elsewhere permanently. Mom was officially expelled from the group she'd founded. Saturday was worse. Dad's boss and his wife arrived for dinner. Every doorway in the house was now empty, creating a bizarre warehouse like atmosphere. The boss's wife kept clutching her purse, looking terrified. Is this some kind of renovation? The boss asked care. It's our transparency policy, I explained cheerfully. My parents believe doors prevent honest family communication. During dinner, the boss's wife whispered she needed to leave immediately. I can't use a bathroom without a door. This is insane. They left before the appetizers. Dad got a text that night saying he needed to sort out his home situation before returning to the office. He was being placed on administrative leave. Mom confronted me Sunday morning in what used to be the living room doorway.

I responded, understood. Two days later, their lawyer reached out to me in a panic. I've been the family's financial backbone for nearly 4 years. I paid their 1,800 dollar monthly mortgage like clockwork. Plus utilities, insurance, emergency repairs, everything. My name, my credit, my money. They never said thank you. My sister Marissa was always in crisis. Credit card maxed out, I paid it. Car repairs, I covered it. Daycare costs, I sent cash. Until she figured it out. Three years later, she was still figuring it out. I never said no because I thought this was what family did. Until I Learned it was exactly what they expected. The first crack appeared while scrolling Facebook. There was Marissa, my parents and the kids in front of the house I was paying for, holding a Home Sweet Home sign. The caption, so proud of our daughter for building a future we can all share. This home is in the right hands. No acknowledgement of me, no tag, no gratitude. Just them smiling on a porch I had paid for. Days later, I called the bank. Mortgage was still in my name, but there was a request to change the primary contact to Miss Marissa Harper. Then I found $2,400 missing from my account, transferred to Marissa's emergency card. When confronted, she said, don't make this a thing, Jordan. We needed groceries. I assumed we were still sharing that card. My Mother's response Marissa is going through a lot. Let's not fight over a few dollars. Few dollars for me. Disaster for Marissa when she missed a phone payment. The family group chat became worse. Someone posted a meme of a man handing over his wallet. Big brother energy pay now, ask never. My cousin tag Jordan. Another can you cover my student loans too? My father only if you name your child after him to keep the donor happy. Nobody defended me. But the final blow came while mowing their backyard. The kitchen window was open and I heard my mother and Marissa talking. Marissa laughed. Did you see his face when I told Aunt Karen the house was mine? He didn't even blink. Like a puppy, just happy to sniff the plate. Mom giggled. Once the paperwork goes through, he won't be able to say anything. Then Marissa delivered the killing blow. Mom, he's not family anymore. He's just a sponsor. I stood there letting those words sink in. Not family, just a sponsor. Three weeks later came the invitation for my mother's 60th birthday. 60 guests, full catering, a legacy event. I didn't RSVP, I just prepared. I printed everything. $311,115 and 84 total contributions with dates and bank records. I saved the audio of their conversation and screenshots of the group chat mockery. I arrived 15 minutes late. During the speeches about sacrifice and love, the screen showed the house with built with love passed down with Purpose? No mention of me. My mother took the microphone. I'm proud of Marissa.

I said that works out perfectly. We've been together for four years. Sarah and I were saving for a house, had our whole future planned out. I'm a systems analyst so I see patterns everywhere, including the one red flag I could never quite figure out, her best friend, Ethan. This guy was always around, always broke, always had some get rich quick scheme about to take off. He'd make little jokes at my expense that we're just innocent enough to deny. But Sarah always defended him. He's like a brother to me. She'd say he just doesn't have the stability you do. The stability she was talking about was me. I was paying most of our bills while she contributed what she could to our house fund. Last Tuesday, she came home with this weird energy, nervous but trying to act excited. She sat me down on the couch. We'd spent three weekends picking out together. I have amazing news. She started way too bright. Ethan's roommate is moving out and I'm going to take the spot. I just stared at her. You're what? Now think about it. His rent is so much cheaper than my half here. I could save an extra thousand a month. We'd get our house so much faster. She wasn't asking. He was telling me. After four years together, she was announcing she was moving in with another man. Like I didn't get a vote. I could have lost it. Could have yelled, argued, given her the fight she was clearly expecting. Instead, I smiled. Sarah, that works out perfectly. Her whole face changed. This wasn't the script she'd prepared for it. It does. Absolutely. That's brilliant financial planning. I'm proud of you for thinking long term like that. She spent the rest of the night talking excitedly about how much money she'd save, how mature we were being. I just nodded along, playing the supportive boyfriend. Later, while she was on the phone with Ethan making plans, I sat quietly planning my own moves. She hung up. I sat down across from her. You know what, you've inspired me. Since you're making this big financial sacrifice, I should do the same. She looked confused. What do you mean? Remember that project I mentioned, the one in Europe? Two year contract, massive pay bump, huge completion bonus. I was going to turn it down because I didn't want to leave what we're building. But now I watched her face go white. I called them tonight and accepted. The timing is perfect. I can put everything in storage, live cheap over there, and we can put my entire salary toward the house. By the time I get back, we'll be able to buy our dream place in cash. You, you took a job in Europe. The contract's coming tomorrow. I start in three weeks. Oh, and I'm ending the lease here. At the end of the month, since we'll both be moved out, pure panic. But where will I stay when I visit, visit Sarah? Flights from Europe are expensive. We need to be disappointed if we're really doing this. Then I hit her with the knockout punch. And since we'll be managing our finances separately for two years, we need to split everything now. I've got a spreadsheet ready. The brilliant plan she'd cooked up with Ethan, where she got to play house with him while keeping me as her financial safety net just evaporated.

I was 12 when a tornado warning Siren went off at 2:00am. Most kids never think about what their parents would actually do in a real emergency until it happens. I found out the hard way. The sirens were screaming outside our house and I could hear the wind picking up something fierce. I'd done tornado drills at school a million times. Teacher always said the same thing. Have a plan. With your family, nowhere to go, stick together. So when I heard that awful wailing sound, I did exactly what I was supposed to do. I ran straight to my parents bedroom, heart pounding in my chest. The door was already open and mom was frantically pulling clothes out of dresser drawers while dad grabbed boxes from under the bed. Grab the photo albums! Mom shouted at him, pointing to the bookshelf. What about me? I asked, standing there in my pajamas with my hair all messy from sleep. Neither one of them even looked at me. Dad rushed past me carrying our old wedding albums and some jewelry boxes. Mom was right behind him with her arms full of important papers and more pictures. I followed them downstairs, my bare feet cold on the hardwood floor. I could hear the thunder getting louder outside, and the rain was starting to hammer against the windows. The emergency radio was crackling with warnings about rotation. Spotted just a few miles away. When We got to the basement door. Mom turned around and saw me standing there. There's no more room, she snapped, like I was asking for something unreasonable. Then they shut the door right in my face. I stood there in that dark hallway alone, while the whole house shook from thunder. The sirens kept wailing, and I could hear the wind outside getting stronger and stronger. It sounded like a freight train was coming straight for us. I tried knocking on the basement door, but they didn't answer. I called for them, but nothing. So I crawled under the kitchen table with Buster, our old golden retriever, and wrap my arms around him. He was shaking just as bad as I was. That's when it really hit me. If that tornado came through our neighborhood, my parents weren't going to open that door for me. They'd rather save their stupid photo albums than make sure their own daughter was safe. The storm lasted about 20 minutes, but it felt like hours. When the sirens finally stopped and the wind died down, I heard the basement door creek open. Mom and dad came upstairs looking all annoyed, like the whole thing had just been a big inconvenience. You should have knocked harder, mom said when she saw me still under the table. You could have been hurt if you came down with all that stuff, dad added, gesturing to their precious boxes. You'll thank us one day when we still have The photo albums. I'm finished. But I didn't thank them. Not that night. Not ever. The next week at school, missus Coleman asked our class to talk about emergency preparedness. What's something you'd grab in an emergency? She wanted to know. Kids raised their hands with all the normal answers. Jamie said she'd grab her baby brother. Tyler said his cat

Day two made her beg to end it. After watching some productivity guru on TikTok, my wife announced we were switching lives. I'll handle your remote marketing job. You take care of the kids and house. I work from home while she's a stay at home mom to our twin four year olds. She always complains. I have it easy just sitting at a computer. Deal, I said. But no backing out when it gets tough. Day one started at 6 a m. With the twins having a meltdown over different colored cups. I refereed breakfast wars. She confidently sat down at my desk. By 10:00am, I'd already broken up three fights, cleaned crayon off the walls, and started laundry. Meanwhile, she was still trying to figure out my project management software. Then my inbox started blowing up with emails from my boss. Where's the client presentation? The meetings in an hour. I heard her panicking upstairs while I dealt with one twin flushing toys down the toilet and the other finger painting the couch. She rushed downstairs. How do I access the files? The clients asking about metrics. I don't understand. Figure it out, I said. Wiping peanut butter off everything. You said my job was just clicking buttons. By lunch, she'd missed two client calls and I'd prevented one house fire. Thirty minutes later, another crisis. The campaign launches today and I can't find the ad copy! She screamed. From upstairs, I was currently preventing our son from eating glue while our dog daughter decided the cat needed a makeover with permanent markers. Check the shared drive, I called back. The one labeled current projects. There are hundreds of folders. Which one? The one that says Johnson campaign launch ready, I replied, stopping our daughter from giving the cat a Mohawk. At 2 p m, my phone rang. It was our biggest client you just sent us. Last quarters presentation instead of the new campaign we're launching in two hours. What's going on? I put them on hold while mediating a toddler dispute over a broken crayon and explaining why we can't flush daddy's watch down the toilet. I'll call you back in five minutes with a solution. I found her crying at my staring at 17 browser tabs of confusion. I deleted something important and can't find the backup. The backup is automatic, I said, carrying one screaming child while the other hung off my leg. But you need to check the revision history. I don't know what that means. While she had a breakdown upstairs, I managed to restore her files remotely on my phone, feed the kids lunch, and negotiate with our daughter about why we can't paint the dog. By four PM, she'd accidentally sent our competitors pricing strategy to the wrong client and scheduled three meetings for the same time slot. Day two started with her shaking me awake at 5:00am. I can't sleep. I keep thinking about everything. I messed up. I found her stress cleaning the kitchen, something she'd never done before. The twins woke up demanding different breakfast cereals simultaneously. She stared helplessly at my laptop. The quarterly report is due today, she said, voice cracking. I don't even know what metrics they want. I was currently negotiating why we can't have ice cream for breakfast while preventing a twin revolt. Pull up the template from last

The laminated list was waiting on my kitchen counter when I got home. 20 marriage rules in bold letters sitting next to my dinner plate like some corporate memo. What's this? I asked. Pick up the ridiculous document. Our marriage needs structure, she said, arms crossed. These rules start immediately. I scanned through them. Share my location 24 7. Get approval for purchases over $50. Text hourly updates. Went out with friends. Rule 8 said I needed permission to work late. Rule 12 required detailed expense reports for lunch money. Rule 17 banned me from watching sports after 9 p m. Without her consent. List was insane. But what really caught my attention was her phone buzzing constantly. Her new country club friends were in a group chat waiting for updates on how well she trained her husband. Can't wait to hear how he took the rules. One message read, my husband would never stand for it. You're so lucky he's so obedient. That's when it clicked. This wasn't about our marriage at all. This was about showing off to her friends that she could control me completely. I was becoming her trophy husband. Proof of her dominance. I remembered how this all started six months ago when she joined that country club. Suddenly, she was having weekly brunches with wives who bragged about monitoring their husbands bank accounts and tracking their every Movement. For three days, I played along perfectly. Minimal resistance, just enough to seem like myself. I shared my location when she asked. I texted her hourly updates during my lunch with Dave from work. I even asked permission before buying a coffee that cost $6. All the while, I watched her text constant updates to her little audience. During dinner, she'd type under the table, he's coming around, she wrote Tuesday night. Easier than I thought. Barely any push back. The casual disrespect stung, but I kept my composure. This wasn't about my ego anymore. This was about ending this ridiculous power trip once and for all. Wednesday night, she escalated things. She placed a rule violation notepad beside my plate, complete with carbon, ready to document my failures like some kind of performance review. So, she said, settling into her chair with a satisfied smile, do you have something to say about our new arrangement? She was expect giving me to finally break, to plead for mercy, negotiate compromises, maybe beg her to reduce the rules to something more reasonable. Her friends had probably coached her on this moment. Actually, I said calmly, setting down my fork, I've been thinking about your rules quite a bit, and I've decided to add one rule of my own. Her eyebrows shot up in surprise, then narrowed into suspicion. Your rule? She asked, as if the concept was completely foreign. Every relationship needs balance. Once, I replied steadily, you had time. To think about what you want from this marriage. I've had time to consider what I want, too. I could see the calculations happening behind her eyes. Fighting. This would cause exactly the kind of scene she wanted to avoid. After all, her whole strategy depended on maintaining the illusion that I was willingly accepting her control. She was trapped, and she knew it. Rejecting my single rule would expose that this was never about mutual respect or marriage improvement. It was about domination.

Don't wait up. Then her boss called asking why she wasn't at the conference. I said, thanks for the information. When she came home to an empty house and divorce papers, her story suddenly changed. Jasmine and I had been together for seven years, married for most of it. Thursday afternoon, I got her text from what was supposed to be a three day pharmaceutical conference. Hey, babe, conference is going amazing. They added extra workshops for top performers, extending till Sunday. Don't wait up. Love you. I was typing back, congrats, babe, when my phone rang. Howard, her direct supervisor. Hey, is Jasmine feeling better? We're concerned since she called out sick for the conference. It's mandatory, and missing it affects her quarterly review. I sat there for 10 seconds. Phone pressed my ear. Thanks for the information, Howard. She said it was a stomach bug. She's fine. Appreciate the call. I hung up and stared at her text. Conference is going amazing. The lying came so easily to her. Even added love you at the end. Here's the thing about Jasmine. She thinks she's smarter than everyone, but gets sloppy when confident. Like using our shared credit card. Like forgetting location sharing was still on. I pulled up find my iPhone. She was at the Rosewood Hotel, 40 minutes away. The conference was three states over. I didn't scream or throw things. Just felt clarity. Like finally understanding A puzzle that's been bugging you? I called my brother in law, Tony, who's a divorce attorney. Hypothetical question. What's needed to file for divorce based on adultery evidence? Texts, photos, credit card statements. This isn't hypothetical, is it? Can you have papers ready by tonight? What's going on? Jasmine's at a hotel with Kevin. While supposedly at a conference. Silence. Tony had introduced us. I'll have them ready. I spent two hours methodically packing her belongings. Seven years of marriage. But the house was mine before we married. Retirement accounts. Separate, right? We've been living parallel financial lives. The beautiful part. The prenup Jasmine had insisted on when we got married. She was making more than me, then wanted to protect her assets. Funny how that works. I left her stuff organized in the garage with divorce papers on the kitchen counter and a sticky note. Howard called. He hopes you feel better from your stomach bug. She called at 11 p m. 15 missed calls before texting frantically. Then I'm driving home right now. Even by her lie timeline, she wasn't supposed to return until Sunday. The next morning, 83 text messages. They cycled through denial. Howard confused me with someone else, anger. You're pathetic. Arguing. Can we please just talk? I finally responded. Your signature on the prenup suggests otherwise. She called immediately. You set me up. How did I set you up? Howard had no right to call you. So you weren't at the conference. I Needed a mental health break. The Rosewood Hotel with Kevin. Silence. I hadn't mentioned Kevin yet. Her work friend who'd been commenting fire emojis on her Instagram posts. Your reservation is under K. Patterson. You used our credit card. I can explain. Cool. Explain it to the judge.

Hit everyone's car multiple times over several months, stealing whatever he could find. Phones, wallets, who's change, anything valuable left visible. This kid was relentless. Didn't care about security cameras or motion lights. Just kept coming back, night after night, like some kind of criminal ghost.

My cousin Rachel just buried her husband and two kids last week. Car accident took them all at once. She's left with just her 5 year old daughter Emma. And honestly, watching them at the funeral was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So my brother Jake and his wife Kelly show up to our house that morning before we head to the church. First thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral. And she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. At the cemetery, she literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would Mention how hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I know. Now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce pregnant lady coming through or baby on board needs to pee there. We're like 30 people there grieving and she's treating it like her personal pregnancy announcement party. But then she crossed the line. Rachel was sitting quietly in the corner with Emma, both of them just completely destroyed. Kelly walks right up to them, sticks out her flat belly and says, me and Jake just found out I'm pregnant. And honestly, we're beside ourselves thinking about how something like this could happen to us, too. Rachel completely broke down, started sobbing so hard she could barely breathe. Emma got scared and started crying, too. Everyone in the room just stopped and stared. That's when I lost it. I stood up and said loud enough for everyone to hear, Kelly, no one gives a damn that you're pregnant. Look around you. This is a funeral for two babies and their father. You took that pregnancy test 4 days ago and you're acting like you're the first woman to ever get pregnant. Just leave. Kelly started crying and ran out. Jake followed her, but not before calling me a fat, bitter witch in front of everyone. My aunt had to comfort Rachel while my mom took Emma outside. My phone's been blowing up all day with calls from Jake and Kelly's family calling me every name in the book. They're saying I made a pregnant woman cry and I'm heartless. Jake texted me that Kelly.

I'm a founder. I walked to my kitchen cabinet, the one where old papers go to die, and pulled out a dusty black binder. My original founder's agreement from 2001. I flipped to page 47, clause 14 D. Any material adverse change to compensation triggers immediate Severance payout of $25 million, payable within 72 business hours. My old lawyer, Bruce Insisted on it back when we were worth nothing. Four of us in a garage, surviving on ramen and spite. Ellen, he said, pouring cheap whiskey into coffee mugs. Someday this company will get big and stupid. When it does, you'll want a kill switch. We laughed about it then. 25 million felt like monopoly money. Now the company is worth 2.8 billion. I called my current lawyer, Charles. Is clause 14 D still active? Three hour callback. Ellen, they never avoided it. In fact, when they restructured executive compensation in 2019, your original agreement was specifically exempted. They're completely screwed. That's when I smiled for the first time in weeks. I drafted one simple email to HR due to pension freeze. Per HR 4 5 to 6 B, invoking clause 14 D. Per founders agreement. Please confirm wire transfer timeline. E. Morrison, Co Founder. I added my old title just to watch them scramble. Sent it at 9:00am on a Tuesday. At 10:15, my phone started buzzing. Unknown numbers, frantic voicemails from people I hadn't heard from in years. Word was spreading through the executive floors like wildfire. The CFO called at 11:00am. His voice was shaking. Ellen, we need to talk. This is. This is serious. About what? I asked, sipping my tea, watching squirrels fight over bird seed in my backyard. The claws. The 25 million claws. Please tell me this is some kind of mistake. Oh, that. No mistake. Yes. 72 business hours. Starts now. Wire instructions are attached. To my original

Six months after I caught my wife cheating on me with my 18 year old brother, she sent me an email demanding I pay for her healing retreat to Bali. I need this to process the trauma of our marriage ending, she wrote in the email and attached an itemized list of demands. First class flights, five star beachfront villa, and a luxury spa package. At the bottom of the email she added, this is the cost of wasting my youth. Her lawyer sent a formal letter supporting her request for emotional damages. I called my ex immediately. Are you insane? You cheated on me with my brother! That's exactly why I need this, she said, her voice fake. Sweet guilt is eating me alive. Don't you want me to heal? I laughed in disbelief and hung up. She called me again immediately, starting with a threat. If you don't pay for my trip, I'm taking the stupid dog and impounding him. I glanced over at my golden retriever, who wagged when he noticed me looking at him. You wouldn't watch me, she said. You work 60 hour weeks. Far as the court knows, I've been his primary caregiver for years. So what's it gonna be? A vacation or your dog? I looked down at my dog. Fine, I'll book your trip. I agreed through gritted teeth. But I wasn't going to let her enjoy her trip that easily. I mean, Cheating is one thing, but threatening my dog? I opened my laptop and started brainstorming the worst Bali vacation itinerary in the world. I found a 30 hour flight with two overnight layovers, selecting the middle seat in the back row. And of course, no meal service. I found a hostel with the word luxury in its name and got her a nice reservation in a 12 bedroom. The authentic Balinese spa I found had been cited for health violations twice because of their sketchy fish pedicures. I did give her a nice yoga retreat. Just so happens to be three hours away from the hostel according to Google. Very difficult to find. And to make sure she's well fed, I bought the terrible food coupons from the hostel as a package deal. I made sure everything was booked in her name. All non refundable, no changes allowed. It's all set. I texted her confirmation numbers coming your way. I did feel a little guilty and thought about adding something nice maybe at the end of the trip, but then she replied finally doing something right and suddenly I was less guilty about it all. My ex called me when she landed in Bali. Complete be fuming, you absolute piece of man trash! This place has bed bugs and mold and other people! She yelled over the sound of terrible karaoke in the background and almost laughed. Do you even know where I am right now? The luxury villa you Wanted? I asked, innocently hitting record on my phone. I'm in a hostel. A hostel with Australian teenagers who won't stop playing guitar. The freaking beach is beside a sewage dump, so obviously no one was there. And that flight you booked had me in three different airports for hours. Oh, and I went to that little yoga retreat you added as a gift. They had me rolling around in dirt and hugging trees, saying it was part of a spiritual awakening process. I muted myself on the call and burst out laughing, shaking hard in my seat the more she ranted about the trip. I wiped away the tear in my eye and cleared my throat before unmuting. Wow, that's terrible. I honestly was just following the list you gave me. I really can't believe it. Don't worry, I reassured her. I'll leave them bad reviews for you and bye. My bad. Of course I meant five stars for giving me the best laugh I've had in a while. When I get back, I'm taking your dog to the pound myself. I'm taking the truck. I'm taking everything! Everything! She screamed. For booking you a vacation? For sleeping with my teenage brother! I'm gonna make you pay! I'll tell the judge whatever it takes to make you suffer. I'll say you hit me! You hit money! You threatened to hurt me if I didn't sign the papers! You think you're so clever. Wait until

The laminated list was waiting on my kitchen counter when I got home. 20 marriage rules in bold letters, sitting next to my dinner plate like some corporate memo. What's this? I asked, picking up the ridiculous document. Our marriage needs structure, she said, arms crossed. These rules start immediately. I scanned through them. Share my location 24 7. Get approval for purchases over $50. Next. Hourly updates went out with friends. Rule 8 said I needed permission to work late. Rule 12 required detailed expense reports for lunch money. Rule 17 banned me from watching sports after 9 p m. Without her consent. The list was insane. But what really caught my attention was her phone buzzing constantly. Her new country club friends were in a group chat waiting for updates on how well she trained her husband. Can't wait to hear how he took the rules. One message read, my husband would never stand for it. You're so lucky he's so obedient. That's when it clicked. This wasn't about our marriage at all. This was about showing off to her friends that she could control me completely. I was becoming her trophy husband, proof of her dominance. I remembered how this all started six months ago when she joined that country club. Suddenly, she was having weekly brunches with wives who bragged about monitoring their husbands bank accounts, tracking their every Movement. For three days, I played along perfectly. Minimal resistance, just enough to seem like myself. I shared my location when she asked. I texted her hourly updates during my lunch with Dave from work. I even asked permission before buying a coffee that cost $6. All the while, I watched her text constant updates to her little audience. During dinner, she'd type under the table, he's coming around, she wrote Tuesday night. Easier than I thought. Barely any pushback. The casual disrespect stung, but I kept my composure. This wasn't about my ego anymore. This was about ending this ridiculous power trip once and for all. Wednesday night, she escalated things. She placed a rule violation notepad beside my plate, complete with carbon, ready to document my failures like some kind of performance review. So, she said, settling into her chair with a satisfied smile, do you have something to say about our new arrangement? She was expecting me to finally break, to plead for mercy, negotiate compromises, maybe beg her to reduce the rules to something more reasonable. Her friends had probably coached her on this moment. Actually, I said calmly, setting down my fork, I've been thinking about your rules quite a bit, and I've decided to add one rule of my own. Her eyebrows shot up in surprise, then narrowed into suspicion. Your rule? She asked, as if the concept was completely foreign. Every relationship needs balance, I replied steadily. You had time to think about What you want from this marriage? I've had

Then at a family dinner, she looked me in the eyes and said, you give us nothing but headaches. The room went dead silent. My uncle stopped chewing midbite, a piece of roast beef hanging from his fork. My aunt stared at her plate like it held the secrets of the universe. My cousins suddenly found their phones fascinating, frantically scrolling through TikTok to avoid the tension. Not one person defended me. I had covered everything for three years. 12 thousand eight hundred dollar monthly mortgage on this 4 bedroom house in the suburbs. Water, electricity, gas, internet. The premium package because my teenage cousins needed their Netflix and gaming. Groceries every week, sometimes twice when they had friends over. Car insurance for both vehicles in the driveway, even the landscaping service because mom complained about the neighbors judging her lawn. Every month, without fail, 4 two hundred dollars left my account to keep their lives comfortable while I lived in a studio apartment across town, eating ramen and skipping vacations. That's not fair, mom, I said, my voice steady despite my hands shaking under the table. I literally pay for everything here. This house, the food you're eating, the lights above our heads, and you never let us forget it! She snapped, her voice rising. You act like some hero swooping in to save us, but real family doesn't keep. For real family helps Without making everyone feel guilty about it. Real family. I looked around the table at these people I've been supporting. My brother Julian shifted uncomfortably in his chair, suddenly very interested in cutting his steak into perfect squares. My sister in law, Nora, studied her wine glass like she was conducting a chemistry experiment. My uncle cleared his throat and reached for the salt he didn't need. Complete, deafening silence. You know what hurts the most? I continued, my voice getting stronger. It's not just the money. It's that I rearranged my entire life for you. I turn. Turn down a promotion that required relocating because you said you needed me close. I broke up with Layla because you said she was taking too much of my attention away from family. Mom waved her hand dismissively. Oh, please don't blame us for your failed relationships. That did it. Something inside me snapped like a dry twig. Okay, I said, standing up so abruptly my chair scraped against the hardwood floor. Okay what? Mom frowned, finally looking uncertain. If my help is such a burden, if I'm such a guilt tripping burden to this family, then I won't burden you anymore. I walked to the coat closet, grabbed my jacket, and added for the door. Behind me I could hear nervous whispers starting up, but no one called my name. No one asked me to stay that night. I sat in my car in the parking lot of my apartment complex. And grabbed my phone. One by one, I canceled every automatic payment connected to her accounts. The mortgage payment scheduled for next week. Canceled the utility auto pay that had been running for three years straight. Canceled the grocery store credit card I'd added her as an authorized user on. Canceled the car insurance, the internet Bill, the stupid premium lawn care service. All of it gone. With a few taps on my screen. Three days later, my phone rang at 6 a m. Mom's name flashed on the screen. I almost didn't answer, but curiosity got the best of me. Please, she said. And I could hear. She'd been crying. Her voice was hoarse, desperate. The electricity company called yesterday. They're shutting off the power today if we don't pay. The mortgage payment bounced. The bank is already calling about late fees. I sat there in my studio apartment, looking at the stack of unpaid bills on my own coffee table.

My brother was born when doctors said my mom couldn't have more kids. They called him their miracle baby. I was 7 and suddenly invisible. For my 10th birthday, I asked to go to Dave and Buster's. They took my brother shopping for school clothes instead. Your birthday can wait, mom said. It never got rescheduled. By high school, the pattern was set. He'd break something, blame me, and I'd get found it. He failed every class, but got a BMW for his 18th birthday. I was valedictorian and got a card. They skipped my graduation because he felt left out and needed a beach day. I stayed home during college to save money, working two jobs while finishing my degree. Every morning, my brother would jingle his BMW keys at me. Still taking the bus. Loser. After six months of overtime shifts, I finally had enough for a down payment. My friend's dad owned a used car dealership and cut me a deal on a blue Dodge Challenger. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. First thing I'd ever owned that my parents hadn't touched. Parked it in the driveway that night, put the keys on my dresser and took about 50 photos. Even posted one on Instagram with the caption earned, not given. Next morning, the keys were gone. So was the car. So was my brother. He probably just borrowed it, mom said. Not looking up for making His favorite breakfast. You know how boys are. He stole my car. Family doesn't steal from family. Three hours later, I heard the engine. My brother pulled up in my challenger. Except the front bumper was dragging, passenger mirror was gone, and there was a cracked spider webbing across the windshield. He tossed me the keys. Your car is junk, bro. Fell apart on the highway. You should get your money back. I stared at the damage. You crashed it. Prove it. My parents immediately sided with him. Dad actually said I should apologize for accusing him of lying. Mom suggested I let my brother borrow it whenever, since he's used to nicer cars and did you a favor by testing it. I walked inside, pulled up my phone, and called 9 1 1. I'd like to report a stolen vehicle that's just been returned damaged. My mother lunged for my phone. What are you doing? Exactly what you do if a stranger stole and crashed your car. The cops arrived in 20 minutes. My brother was smirking until I pulled up the dash cam footage I'd uploaded to the loud. See, I'd installed cameras the day I bought it. Not because I'm psychic, but because I park it in a neighborhood where cars get broken into. The footage showed everything. Him hot wiring it at 3 a m, drag racing down the interstate, T boning a stop sign, laughing as he surveyed the damage, even calling his friend to Brag about teaching me a lesson. The officers watched 30 seconds before cuffing him. This is grand theft auto and reckless endangerment. One said the damage alone makes it a felony. My parents went nuclear. Mom screaming about family loyalty, dad threatening to kick me out. My brother just staring at me like he couldn't comprehend consequences existed. He's your brother, mom sobbed. Then he should have acted like it. The best part came during the trial. My brother's lawyer tried arguing it was a family dispute. Then the prosecutor

Mom chose her boyfriend Rufus over me when I was 16. He claimed I stole his Rolex, which was ridiculous since he pawned it weeks earlier for casino money. Rufus gave mom an ultimatum that night. Either she goes or I go. Mom didn't even hesitate. She packed my clothes and trash bags while I was at school and changed the locks. When I got home, my stuff was on the lawn getting soaked by sprinklers. I spent three weeks sleeping in a 24 hour laundromat. The owner eventually caught me, but instead of kicking me out, he offered me a job cleaning his other properties. That's how I met Mister Thief, a 73 year old man who was more powerful than I could have thought. His daughter had died at 17 in a car accident years earlier. When he found me scrubbing his toilet at 2:00am for grocery money, something in his eyes changed. Within a month, he moved me into one of his vacant luxury condos. Not some rundown unit, but a penthouse he usually rented for $5,000 a month. Mr. Thys brought me dinner every night, helped with homework, and taught me the property business. When other kids were learning to parallel park, I was learning to negotiate lease agreements and manage construction crews. He paid for my prom dress, my college tuition, even walked me down the aisle at my wedding. For five years, he was the father I never had. When he died of a heart attack, he left me everything. 47 rental properties worth $18 million. I was 21 and suddenly one of the largest property owners in the city. I tried reaching out to mom once during those years. Invited her to my high school graduation. She never showed. Drove by the house one Christmas Eve and saw her through the window laughing with Rufus. I knocked for 10 minutes. She looked right at me through the glass and closed the curtain. Mom's sister called me when I was 25. Said mom and Rufus were begging family members for money again, asking if I had anything to spare. They've hit up everyone. Cousins, co workers, even Rufus's ex wife. I hung up and never asked about them again. Then yesterday, mom showed up at my office. No call, no warning. Just walked past my secretary with Rufus trailing behind. They look terrible. Mom had aged 20 years and 12, and Rufus's gut hung over his belt like he drunk two cases of beer. They stood in my office doorway, and I knew immediately this wasn't about making amends. They were getting evicted at the end of the month and needed a place to live. Mom demanded I give them one of my properties her sister told her about. Rent free, obviously because children don't abandon their parents. The same woman who threw me out like trash was lecturing me. About abandonment. She even wanted her name on several deeds for tax purposes. When I said I'd think about it, she appeared at my office building every morning with a sign saying, my daughter owns 47 properties, but lets me be homeless. Security dragged them out, but not before she yelled at the top of her lungs that I was mentally unstable and stole Mister Theese's fortune. She even showed up at Mister Theese's grave with flowers, telling mourners he was his real daughter. The woman who abandoned her child was trying to destroy the life I built without her. After 24 hours of harassment, I'd had enough. I called my lawyer and got the paperwork I'd hoped I'd never need. Then I asked my property manager, August, to drive with me to their apartment. I needed a witness for what was about to happen. The three hour drive gave me time to think about everything Mr. Thief had told me. Success is the best.

Call your mom right now. My blood went cold because Mister Chen had never spoken to me in three years of riding his bus. He was gripping the wheel so tight his hands were shaking. I pulled out my phone with trembling fingers, while the other kid kept talking about tomorrow's game, completely oblivious. My mom answered on the first ring, but it wasn't her voice. Hello, sweetie. A man with a thick accent was using her phone. Your mother is busy right now. She wants you to come straight home. No stops. I couldn't speak. In the background, I heard my mom scream, don't come home! Run! The mine went dead. Mister Chen was already on his radio. Code red on Bus 19. I need police at every upcoming stop now! He locked eyes with me in the mirror. Get down on the floor! Don't let them see you through the window. I dropped between the seats, my heart hammering. Other kids started panicking, but Mister Chen's voice cut through. Everyone down! This is not a drill. Through the gap under the seat, I saw we'd blown past my stop. A white van was parked in my usual spot, engine running, sliding door open. Three men in ski masks were standing beside it, and one was holding what looked like zip ties. My phone buzzed with a text from an unknown Number? We have your parent. Get off the bus at the next stop or they die. You have 60 seconds. Photo came through. My parent bound and gagged in what looked like our basement. My dad's face was bloody. Mr. Chen must have seen my face because he grabbed my phone and read it. It's a trap. Trust me, kid. I've seen this before. Seen what before? I sobbed. Your dad isn't who you think he is. He made a hard turn. Tires screaming. Neither am I. Two more white vans appeared, boxing us in. Mister Chen didn't slow down. Instead, he reached under his dashboard and pulled out something I'd only seen in movie. A satellite phone. Phoenix is compromised assets. Family has been taken. Requesting immediate extraction for the package. He glanced at me. Yes, the package is secure. On route to Safe House 7. Package? I was the package. The white vans rammed us from both sides. Kids were screaming. Mister Chen drove like a stunt driver, using the bus's weight to push through. Your dad saved my daughter's life in Afghanistan. He said, never taking his eyes off the road. I promised I'd protect you if his cover was ever blown. Cover? What cover? Your dad's been investigating the Coslov trafficking ring for 5 years. Someone leaked his identity this morning. These aren't kidnappers. They're Russian Mafia. A helicopter appeared overhead. For a second, I thought we were saved. Then Mister Chen swore in a language I didn't recognize the helicopter was theirs. New plan. He handed me a backpack from under his seat. When I stop, you run to the red door of the building on your left. Don't look back. Don't stop. Someone will be waiting. What about my parent? They're not at your house. That photo was staged.

She thought I was going to cry, but I smiled. Then dad came in, shouting at me. Where are the $15,000 we prepared for your sister's college? My name is Valerie, and I'm 22, still living at home while saving money from my job at a tech startup. My sister Bella is 19 and in college, getting everything handed to her while I had to work my way through school. Last month, our parents hit financial trouble when Dad's business took a. They've been secretly selling family heirlooms and mom's jewelry to scrape together Bella's tuition. They got exactly $15,000 in cash. I watched dad count those bills with shaking hands. Grandma's wedding ring, the antique watch, your mother's pearls. Everything we had left, he whispered to mom. Mom was crying quietly. At least Bella won't have to drop out. She doesn't need to know what we sacrificed. Dad asked me to deposit it at the bank since he had client meetings trying to save his business. I placed the envelope in my desk drawer under textbook, planning to go after work. When I got home, Bella was strutting around our living room like she owned the place. She had a brand new designer handbag, expensive clothes with tags attached, and the latest iPhone Pro Max. She was on the phone, twirling around in her new outfit. Yeah, babe, I sent you the $8,000 like I promised. For your car payments. Don't worry about paying it back right away. My heart sank. I ran to my room, yanking open the desk drawer, I searched frantically. The envelope was gone. I stared at the empty drawer, hands shaking. Although those family treasures sold for nothing. Bella, where's the money from my desk? She rolled her eyes like I was being dramatic. Oh, that. I found it just sitting there when I came home early to surprise everyone. I figured it was family money just lying around. I'm family, right? She held up her new phone and took a selfie, then showed me the screen. You should see your face right now. You look absolutely insane. This is hilarious. I watched her posing with her designer bags, completely oblivious to what she'd done. She'd sent $8,000 to some boyfriend I'd never even met, spent thousands more on herself, and was treating it like a joke. Instead of screaming or crying like she clearly expected, I smiled a calm, knowing smile. You're absolutely right. It is family money. That's when we heard Dad's truck pull into the driveway. His engine was making that grinding noise again, the one he couldn't afford to fix. Dad walked in through the front door, his face already red from stress about his failing business. His work clothes were dusty. His hands were rough from taking on manual labor jobs to make ends meet. Valerie, did you deposit the money? The tuition payment is due. Tomorrow morning. And he stopped mid sentence, his eyes landing on Bella's shopping bag. Scatter across the living room floor. His gaze moved from the designer handbag to her new clothes, to the phone in her hand. I could see him trying to process what he was seeing. Dad, I said calmly, Bella found the $15,000 and spent it all today. The color drained

They forgot the exit clause in my founders agreement that stated any adverse change to my compensation triggered a mandatory 25 million dollar penalty. I knew they'd screwed up the moment I saw that cold corporate email. Due to evolving fiscal priorities, your pension benefits are temporarily suspended. No phone call, no explanation. Just a chatbot message for someone who helped build this company from nothing. I sat in my kitchen toast getting cold while reading it again and again. 30 years of weekends, crises, and late nights, and this is how they repay me? Like I was just another line item to cut? The email came from Jennifer Walsh, some 28 year old VP who probably thinks I'm just another old timer collecting dust and accounting. She's never heard the stories about how I mortgage my house three times to keep payroll running in 0 8. Never knew about the Christmas I spent in the server room fixing a catastrophic data breach while everyone else was home opening presents. But here's what they forgot. I'm not just any employee. I'm a founder. I walked to my kitchen cabinet, the one where old papers go to die, and pulled out a dusty black binder. My original founder's agreement from 2001. I flipped to page 47, clause 14 D. Any material adverse change to compensation triggers immediate Severance payout of $25 million, payable within 72 business hours. My old lawyer, Bruce Insisted on it back when we were worth nothing. Four of us in a garage, surviving on ramen and spite. Ellen, he said, pouring cheap whiskey into coffee mugs. Someday this company will get big and stupid. When it does, you'll want to kill switch. We laughed about it then. 25 million felt like monopoly money. Now the company is worth 2.8 billion. I called my current lawyer, Charles. Is clause 14 D still active? 3 hour callback. Ellen, they never avoided it. In fact, when they restructured executive compensation in 2019, your original agreement was typically exempted. They're completely screwed. That's when I smiled for the first time in weeks. I drafted one simple email to HR due to pension freeze. Per HR, 4 5 6 B, invoking clause 14 D. Per founder's agreement. Please confirm wire transfer timeline. E. Morrison, Co founder. I added my old title just to watch them scramble. Sent it at 9:00am on a Tuesday. At 10:15, my phone started buzzing. Unknown numbers, frantic voicemails from people I hadn't heard from in years. Word was spreading through the executive floors like wildfire. The CFO called at 11:00am. His voice was shaking. Ellen, we need to talk. This is. This is serious. About what? I asked, sipping my tea, watching squirrels fight over bird seed in my backyard. The claws. The 25 million claws. Please tell me this is some kind of mistake. Oh, that. No mistake. Yes. 72 business hours. Starts now. Wire instructions are attached to My original no email. Ellen, you have to understand. This could bankrupt the company. The board is an emergency session. Stock price is already dropping on rumors. I let that sink in for a moment. Funny how bankruptcy works, isn't it? One day you're cutting pensions to boost quarterly numbers. The next day you're explaining to shareholders why your cost cutting measure just triggered a 25 million dollar penalty. We can negotiate. The contract doesn't mention negotiations, David. It says 72 business hours. That's Thursday at 5 p m. I hung up and made myself another cup of tea. By Wednesday morning, three different law firms had called the local news.

When I was 14, I had been begging my parents for a service dog for months. My anxiety had gotten so bad that I couldn't even walk into school without hyperventilating in the parking lot. My therapist told them it would help, but they kept saying no. Dad always said dogs were too much work and too expensive. Mom claimed I was just exaggerating my anxiety to skip school. Dad would joke around dinner. If you're too anxious to go to school, how are you gonna walk a dog every day? So when my and Jake called and said his friend couldn't keep their Labrador mix Scout anymore, I said yes without asking. Scout was already trained for emotional support stuff. I met Jake at the park that Tuesday and walked home with this golden brown dog who immediately started following me around like we've known each other forever. My parents lost their minds when I walked through the door. Mom started yelling about responsibility and vet bills. Dad was pacing around the kitchen saying, I couldn't just bring home random animals. We're so mad they could barely speak to me during dinner. But then dad got this idea. He said I could keep Scout for exactly one week to prove I couldn't handle it. He even pulled out this little blue notebook and started writing down everything I did wrong day one. He wrote that I forgot to fill the water Bowl before school. Day two, he noted that Scout tracked MUD on the carpet. But something weird started happening the First Night Scout was there. I didn't have my usual 3:00am panic attack where I'd end up crying under my blanket. Instead, when I started feeling that familiar tightness in my chest around midnight, Scout jumped onto my bed and put his head right on my chest. His weight was warm and heavy, and somehow my breathing just slowed down. The next morning at breakfast, mom asked why I looked so rested. I told her about Scout helping me sleep, but she just rolled her eyes and said it was probably just the excitement of getting what I wanted. Day three was when things got real. I had this math tutoring session with Mr. Peterson that usually left me in tears because I'd get so anxious about making mistakes. This time, I brought Scout with me. Mr. Peterson seemed annoyed at first, but then something crazy happened. Every time I started bouncing my leg or my breathing got fast, scout would gently paw at my arm. It was like he could feel my anxiety building before I even realized it was happening. I actually solved three problems that day without crying. Mister Peterson looked shocked. I told my parents later that he'd never seen me so calm and focused. Day 4 was the real test, though. I had to meet with Missus Collins, the school counselor, because I'd been missing So many classes. Usually these meetings made me wanna throw up. But Scout came with me. He sat right next to my chair. And when Missus Collins started asking about my attendance, felt that familiar panic rising. But Scout immediately put his paw on my leg and looked right at me. Missus Collins noticed everything. She watched how Scout would nudge me when I started fidgeting. How he'd rest his head against my leg when my voice

I was on a five hour flight to visit my aunt in Denver, and I'd specifically paid extra for an aisle seat in the second to last row. I have Crohn's disease, which means sometimes I need to get to the bathroom fast. Like, really fast. This wasn't some random choice I'd Learned the hard way after a few mortifying incidents. Right before boarding, this pregnant woman walks up to me at the gate. She's probably six or seven months along. Not like she's about to give birth or anything. She taps my shoulder and goes, excuse me, I need your seat. I'm pregnant and need to be close to the bathroom. I looked at her boarding pass. She had a middle seat toward the front of the plane. I'm thinking, okay, she didn't plan ahead, but that's not really my problem. I told her politely, I'm sorry, but I have medical issues, too, and specifically booked this seat. He rolled her eyes and said, what kind of medical issues could you possibly have? You look fine. I'm not about to explain my digestive problems to a stranger. So I just said, it's medical, and I paid extra for this seat. That's when she got loud, this is ridiculous. I'm carrying a baby and you're being selfish. Other passengers started looking over. I felt my face getting red, but held my ground. When we boarded, she made sure to Get on right behind me. As I'm putting my bag in the overhead bin, she starts again. FLIGHT attendant this man won't give up his seat to a pregnant woman. Can you make him move? The flight attendant this tired looking woman, probably in her fifties between us. Sir, would you be willing to switch seats with this passenger? I explained the whole situation again, how I'd specifically booked and paid for this seat because of my medical condition. The flight attendant asked if there were any other aisle seats available. There weren't. The flight was completely full. The pregnant woman started getting more aggressive. What medical condition? You're just being difficult. I really need to be near the bathroom. I told her that if bathroom access was medically necessary for her pregnancy, she should have booked an appropriate seat or spoken to her doctor about accommodations. This set her off completely. She started yelling about how I was discriminating against pregnant women and that she was going to report me. Other passengers were definitely watching. Now some guy a few rows up shook his head at me like I was the worst person alive. The flight attendant tried to calm her down, but eventually said there was nothing they could do if I wasn't willing to switch and there were no other seats available. The pregnant woman stomped to her middle seat, muttering loud enough for everyone to hear about selfish jerks and what's wrong with people these days. About two hours into the flight, I had to use the bathroom urgently. As I'm walking back to my seat, the pregnant woman stops me in the eye.

I worked at this clothing store in the mall called thread and Co. The whole place was divided into three sections. Men's, women's, and kids. I always worked the women's section, and during weekdays, I was literally the only person there. Like, completely alone in that entire half of the store. So yesterday, I clocked in with two other employees. My manager, Lisa, pulled me aside right away and goes, your dad's called the store five times asking for your schedule. Tell him to stop. I was so confused because that didn't sound like my dad at all. He's never even called me at work before, let alone five times in one day. I immediately texted him, did you call my work today? He texted back super fast, saying he'd never called my store once in his life. My stomach dropped. I had this awful feeling creeping up my spine. I walked back over to Lisa, who was holding some sweaters, and asked, do you give my dad my schedule? She said yes without even looking up. That's when I told her that wasn't my dad and she had absolutely no right giving some random stranger my work schedule. She finally looked at me and got this annoyed expression. She rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic and it wasn't a big deal. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Some random Man had been calling my workplace multiple times asking when I'd be there, and she just handed over that information. I started thinking about all the possibilities. This. Some creepy customer who'd been watching me, someone who knew where I lived. My brain was spiraling, thinking about walking to my car alone after closing shifts. The parking garage was already sketchy enough without knowing some weirdo had my exact schedule. Lisa kept folding clothes like nothing happened. She actually shrugged at me. That's when I realised she genuinely didn't understand how dangerous this was. A complete stranger now knew exactly when and where to find me. And she acted like I was overreacting. I looked around the store. It was just me, Lisa, and two other employees for the entire three section store. We were already stretched thin, and I knew if I left, they'd be completely screwed. But I also knew I couldn't stay there knowing my safety had been compromised and my manager didn't even care. I'm done, I said. I quit. Lisa's face completely changed. She dropped the sweater she was holding and started following me as I walked to get my stuff from the breakroom. Wait, you can't be serious. We're already understaffed. Please don't do this to us. But I was already taking off my name tag and grabbing my water bottle. You gave a stranger my personal information and told me I was being dramatic? I'm not staying somewhere where my safety doesn't matter. She started getting frantic, begging me not to leave. I'm sorry, okay? I didn't think about it like that. Please stay. We need you. Her voice was getting shaky. I turned around and looked at her. You need me, but you don't respect me. There's a difference. I started walking toward the exit. That's when she actually started crying. Like, full on tears streaming down her face. She was panicking about having to run the entire store with just two people. She kept apologizing and saying she'd never give out my information again, but it was too late. The thing that really got to me

The doctor said, no heavy lifting for eight weeks. I'm stuck taking care of him when I could be with James. I've been with Rachel for four years and aged for one. She'd always been supportive during my chronic back problems, or so I thought. After my neurosurgeon recommended spinal fusion, Rachel drove me to the hospital, held my hand during prep, and was the last face I saw before anesthesia. I have a weird reaction to anesthesia. I regained consciousness quickly, but remained physically still. I became aware in recovery, maybe 30 minutes after surgery. Eyes closed, breathing slow, but I could hear everything. Then I heard Rachel's voice near my bed. He's still out, she told someone. Before I could signal I was awake, I heard her friend. Ali arrived. How did it go? Ali asked. Fine, I guess, Rachel replied, sounding annoyed rather than concerned. The doctor said, no heavy lifting for eight weeks. I'm stuck taking care of him when I could be with James. James? I didn't know any James. Why not leave? Ali asked quietly. You're not married yet. Rachel paused, then his parents are adding me to their will next month. You know how loaded they are. The old man's health isn't great. Probably why they're updating everything. I just need to stick it out a little longer. My parents, my father, who built a construction company, From nothing. My mother, who taught school for 30 years. The people who'd welcomed Rachel with open arms and insisted on paying for our wedding. That's cold. Raw, even for you, Ali said. It's practical, Rachel replied. Four years listening to him talk about building projects and football, playing nice with his boring family. And now I have to play nurse for two months. What about James? James will wait. Once everything is legal and Richard senior kicks it, I'll be set. James can have his fun now, but he knows the score. Richard senior kicks it. My father. They were discussing my father's death like a business plan. What if Mike wakes up and hears you? Ali asked. Rachel laughed. Cold are please. They pump him so full of drugs, he'll be lucky to remember his name. Besides, he trusts me completely. It's almost too easy. I decided to keep playing unconscious. When a nurse checked my vitals, I woke up slowly, playing the part they expect did. Rachel was immediately by my side. Hey, babe. Everything went great. How are you feeling? Tired, I mumbled. I'm right here. I'll take good care of you. The next few hours, Rachel played devoted fiance perfectly. When visiting hours ended, she kissed my forehead and promised to return in the morning. As soon as she left, I called my parents. Come immediately, it's important. But I'm physically okay. They heard something in my voice and arrived in 30 minutes. I told Them. Everything. James. The will, the death planning. My mother gasped. My father's face turned red. We coordinated immediately. My friend Eric packed all Rachel's belongings into storage. A locksmith changed my apartment locks at 11 p m. My father's attorney removed Rachel from all state documents. My mother called Rachel's parents. They were horrified. I texted Rachel, change of plans. My parents are taking me home tomorrow. Don't come to the hospital. Her reply? Don't be silly, babe. I'll be there at 9:00. I didn't respond. Next

I introduced her to her fiance at my birthday party three years ago. She was crying in the bathroom because another guy had ghosted her, so I literally dragged her out to meet people. And that's when she met her fiance. I stayed up until 4:00am helping her plan the perfect way to ask him out. I held her hair back when she got sick on their first date and drove over with clean clothes. I've already spent 2,000 on the bridesmaid dress, 500 on the bridal shower, and you don't even wanna know how much on the bachelorette party that hasn't even happened yet. Then out of nowhere, she texted me, I can't imagine doing this without you. You're my sister. Here's the part that matters. My mom died eight months ago. She held me at the funeral and whispered, I'll be your family now. She held me while I sobbed until I couldn't breathe and promised we'd get through everything together. Then she text me, we need to talk. Suggest this juice bar downtown. I arrive, and she has actual printed photos spread out on the table. Their inspiration photos of the wedding party, all size 6 or smaller. She's tapping them with her manicured nail and says, you. You have three months to lose 40 pounds, or you can't be a bridesmaid. I stare at her. Bridesmaid. I'm your maid. Of honor. She shakes her head. Not anymore. And if you have a problem with that, you don't have to come at all. That's when I noticed them, her other bridesmaids, sitting two tables over, watching like it was dinner and a show. I stand up slowly and say, I understand perfectly. I'll return the dress tomorrow. She seems shocked by my calm response and start saying, don't be dramatic, I'm trying to help you. But I'm already walking out. First thing the next morning, I block her on everything. Second thing, I turn that two thousand dollar dress and get every penny back. Something about being told I'm too fat to stand next to my best friend makes me realize I've been settling for crumbs my whole life. From her, from everyone. I use the dress refund to sign up for cooking classes I've been wanting to take since college. My friend text me, just come back and lose the weight. You're being a dramatic ass. On the first day of class, I'm chopping onions and crying. The woman next to me is also aggressively chopping and crying. She says, rough day? I say, rough friend. She says, same. Mine just stole my business idea. We go for drinks after class. Three margaritas in, she mentions her uncle is selling his taco truck because he's retiring. We joke about buying it together and becoming the taco Queens of the city. A few days later, she texts, I was serious. About the truck. We meet her uncle, who shows us around. It needs work, but it runs. And he throws in all his recipes. We shake hands on 15,000 split between us. I'd saved most of that to gift my best friend her dream honeymoon to Greece. Now I'm using it to start my own dream. Meanwhile, I see the bride posting, anyone know a reliable bridesmaid asking for a friend? Every Friday night we park outside the college bars and drunk kids love us. We're booked every weekend. We've named it Misfit Tacos, and people can't get enough. My cooking friend is my actual best friend. Now. We have matching taco tattoos. The wedding happens without me. I don't check social media. That

Saturday, I discovered she'd made a fake dating profile using my photos, scheduling dates at my address. Three confused women showed up while I was in sweats. Playing video games. One of them.

Three months later, she was begging for my boring chicken and rice. We've been together for four years, living together for two. I Learned to cook for my Korean mom. She Learned what to eat based on influencers. Two months ago, Michaela came home from a work dinner at some fancy restaurant looking disgusted. Babe, I can't do this anymore. Watching you eat the same chicken breast and broccoli five days a week is literally depressing me. My workers are all doing Blue Apron, trying new cuisines, actually experiencing food. We're young professionals, not college students surviving on ramen. Fair point, but meal prep saves me time and money. That's exactly the problem. You have zero culinary adventure. You eat for fuel, not pleasure. Let's cook separately so I don't have to. Prison food. She actually used the word dystopian to describe my Tupperware containers. Fine. Let's see how this culinary independence works out. So that Sunday, I did my usual meal prep routine. Five pounds of chicken, two bags of rice, assorted vegetables. Total cost $42 for the entire week. Meanwhile, Michaela spent $387 at Whole Foods buying saffron truffle oil, organic heirloom tomatoes, and ingredients for exactly three recipes she screenshotted from TikTok. She posted an Instagram story of her haul with the caption, finally eating like an adult. Week one, she made one elaborate mushroom risotto that took three hours. And used every pot we owned. Turned out decent actually. Week two, the other ingredients started going bad immediately. Turns out fresh basil doesn't last two weeks. I'm watching her throw away $40 worth of spoiled organic vegetables. Then she attempted pan seared salmon with herb blanc sauce. Smoke alarm went off at eleven PM. Thick gray smoke everywhere. Couldn't see across the kitchen. I ran in with a towel, frantically waving at the alarm while she stood frozen holding a flaming pan. The salmon was charcoal on one side, raw on the other. The sauce had separated into. Our neighbor knocked asking if we needed the fire department. I followed the recipe exactly. She was near tears, mascara running from the smoke. That salmon cost 47 dollars. She ordered Thai food at midnight. I just need a break to regroup after that. Doordash notifications every single day. She's discovered artisanal meal delivery. 28 dollar grain bowls, 32 dollar popcorns, 24 dollar acai bowls. Everything's a bowl and everything's overpriced. Meanwhile, I'm actually perfecting my system without having to accommodate her preferences. Started experiment hunting with marinades. Discovered this incredible garlic ginger sauce. Bought a food scale for perfect portions. Lost eight pounds without trying. My grocery Bill dropped to $35 per week. Month two she's gained 12 pounds from restaurant portions. Spent $2,300 on food. According to her Mint app notification that she immediately swiped away. Making passive aggressive comments about my sad desk lunches while secretly staring at My perfectly seasoned chicken. The funniest part? She started following meal prep accounts on Instagram but won't admit she's interested. Instead she makes comments to her friends on Facetime about how I literally weigh my rice like a serial killer. While she's eating takeout sushi for the third night straight. Month three. Her credit card gets declined at Chipotle. She's maxed it out at $5,000. Mostly food delivery and overpriced groceries that went bad. She comes home to find me eating my standard Monday dinner grilled chicken with homemade teriyaki glaze over Jasmine rice. She just stands there defeated. That smells like restaurant food. How is that your boring meal prep? I show her my spice drawer. 32 different seasonings, 5 homemade sauce recipes, 3 marinades rotating weekly. You thought I was just throwing plain chicken in the oven? I've been perfecting these recipes for two years. Each container is different even though I use the same base ingredients. She opens my fridge, actually looks at my labeled containers for the first time. Monday Teriyaki, Tuesday Buffalo, Wednesday Mediterranean, etcetera. This is more variety than my $30.

My brother was born when doctors said my mom couldn't have more kids. They called him their miracle baby. I was 7 and suddenly invisible. For my 10th birthday, I asked to go to Dave and Buster's. They took my brother shopping for school clothes instead. Your birthday can wait, mom said. It never got rescheduled. By high school, the pattern was set. He'd break something, blame me, and I'd get found it. He failed every class, but got a BMW for his 18th birthday. I was valedictorian and got a card. They skipped my graduation because he felt left out and needed a beach day. I stayed home during college to save money, working two jobs while finishing my degree. Every morning, my brother would jingle his BMW keys at me. Still taking the bus. Loser. After six months of overtime shifts, I finally had enough for a down payment. My friend's dad owned a used car dealership and cut me a deal on a blue Dodge Challenger. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. First thing I'd ever owned that my parents hadn't touched. Parked it in the driveway that night, put the keys on my dresser and took about 50 photos. Even posted one on Instagram with the caption earned, not given. Next morning, the keys were gone. So was the car. So was my brother. He probably just borrowed it, mom said. Not looking up for making His favorite breakfast. You know how boys are. He stole my car. Family doesn't steal from family. Three hours later, I heard the engine. My brother pulled up in my challenger. Except the front bumper was dragging, passenger mirror was gone, and there was a cracked spider webbing across the windshield. He tossed me the keys. Your car is junk, bro. Fell apart on the highway. You should get your money back. I stared at the damage. You crashed it. Prove it. My parents immediately sided with him. Dad actually said I should apologize for accusing him of lying. Mom suggested I let my brother borrow it whenever, since he's used to nicer cars and did you a favor by testing it. I walked inside, pulled up my phone, and called 9 1 1. I'd like to report a stolen vehicle that's just been returned damaged. My mother lunged for my phone. What are you doing? Exactly what you do if a stranger stole and crashed your car. The cops arrived in 20 minutes. My brother was smirking until I pulled up the dash cam footage I'd uploaded to the loud. See, I'd installed cameras the day I bought it. Not because I'm psychic, but because I park it in a neighborhood where cars get broken into. The footage showed everything. Him hot wiring it at 3 a m, drag racing down the interstate, T boning a stop sign, laughing as he surveyed the damage, even calling his friend to Brag about teaching me a lesson. The officers watched 30 seconds before cuffing him. This is grand theft auto and reckless endangerment. One said the damage alone makes it a felony. My parents went nuclear. Mom screaming about family loyalty, dad threatening to kick me out. My brother just staring at me like he couldn't comprehend consequences existed. He's your brother, mom sobbed. Then he should have acted like it. The best part came during the trial. My brother's lawyer tried arguing it was a family dispute. Then the prosecutor

Daniela got rejected by Hudson three weeks ago. He's this quiet kid in our chemistry class who mostly keeps to himself. Daniela has been obsessed with him since September. She finally asked him to Winter Formal, and he politely said no. He wasn't mean about it. He just said he wasn't interested in dating right now. Daniela completely lost it. She's 17 like me, but she acted like a psycho ex girlfriend from a Netflix show. She came to my house that night sobbing and saying Hudson humiliated her. I tried to tell her it wasn't that deep, but she wasn't hearing it. She kept saying he thought he was better than her, that he needed to be taught a lesson. A week later, Daniela showed me something on her phone that disgusted me. She'd created a whole fake Instagram account. Some gorgeous girl named Angela from our neighboring school. She'd been messaging Hudson as this fake girl for five days already. Hudson had completely fallen for it. This kid who barely talks to anyone at school was pouring his heart out to Angela. He told her about his anxiety, how his dad left when he was 12, how he felt invisible at school and wondered if anyone would ever actually want him. He sent her his artwork that nobody knew. He did these beautiful charcoal drawings of birds and landscapes. He even sent her Poems he wrote about being lonely. Daniela was screenshotting everything. She had hundreds of screenshots saved in a folder on her phone labeled Hudson's Funeral. When I saw that folder name, I felt sick. I asked Daniela what she was planning. She got this creepy smile and told me the plan. Hudson's 18th birthday was next Friday. His mom had rented out the bowling alley and invited our whole chemistry class. She was trying to help him make friends, since he struggled socially. Daniela was going to connect her laptop to the TV screens at the bowling alley. She was going to display all of Hudson's messages for everyone to see. Everything. His poems about wanting to disappear, his message about being scared he'd die a virgin. A voice note where he talked about his depression and medication. Photos of his artwork with deeply personal captions about his dead dad. She even had a message where he admitted he cried himself to sleep sometimes. I told Daniela she couldn't do this. This would destroy him. She just laughed and said I was being dramatic. She said maybe next time he wouldn't reject girls who were clearly out of his league. Then she said something that made my blood run cold. She said after everyone saw what a loser he was, maybe he'd finally kill himself and do everyone a favor. That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about Hudson. How he helped me pass chemistry last year. How he Always smiled and said hi, even though we weren't friends. How excited he'd been lately, probably because he thought Angela actually liked him. Two days went by, and I watched Hudson at school. He was different, more confident. He actually raised his hand in class. He sat with people at lunch instead of alone. This fake relationship was the best thing that had happened to him, and Daniela was about to weaponize it. I couldn't let it happen. Four days before the party, I did something that would probably end my friendship with Daniela. I made my own anonymous Instagram account. I messaged Hudson, saying I went to Angela's school and needed to warn him. I told him Angela was fake, that someone from his school was catfishing him, and plan something horrible for his birthday. Hudson didn't believe me at first. He said I was probably just jealous or trying to mess with him. So I did something I still feel guilty about. I sent him screenshots that Daniela had sent me. Screenshots showing the back end of the fake account with Daniela's email attached. Hudson blocked the Angela account immediately. He didn't come to school for three days. The day of his party arrived. Daniela still showed up with her laptop in her bag, hoping Hudson would show. But Hudson never came to his

When my best friend Noah got engaged to Lauren, I was literally the one who helped pick out the ring. We spent three hours at this fancy jewelry store downtown while he stressed about every detail. Everyone kept saying Lauren and Noah were like this perfect power couple. He was super steady and patient. She was bubbly and smart as hell. And me, I was just the loyal third wheel. Basically their honorary sister at that point. But here's the thing. Nobody knew. When Noah had those really rough days at work, he didn't call Lauren. He called me. I knew his exact coffee order. Black with two sugars and oat milk foam. I knew his mom was having surgery for her hip, and he was freaking out about it. I even knew the password to his laptop because he always forgot it and would text me at random times. Lauren didn't even know what his favorite movie was. The Princess Bride. By the way. Six weeks before the wedding, I went over to Lauren's apartment to try on my bridesmaid dress. It was this ugly sage green thing that made me look like a sick plant, but whatever. While she was in the kitchen making tea, I was looking for a hairbrush in her bedroom because my hair was a complete mess from the rain. I opened what I thought was her bathroom closet, but It wasn't. Inside was her wedding dress, which was gorgeous and white and perfect. But right next to it was this red cocktail dress I'd never seen before. Expensive looking heels, and a whole stack of love notes tied with a ribbon. The handwriting definitely wasn't Noah's. My stomach dropped. I quickly closed the closet and pretended nothing happened. But my hands were literally shaking when Lauren came back with the tea. I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. Finally, I worked up the nerve to confront her. We met at this coffee shop near her work, and I just straight up asked her about the notes. She went completely pale and started crying right there in front of everyone. She told me the affair had ended months ago, but she still wasn't sure she actually loved Noah. She said she felt super pressured to marry him because he was quote unquote, the perfect guy, and literally everyone thought they were amazing together. Her parents loved him, her friends were jealous. Even her boss would ask about wedding planning. I was completely devastated, but I kept my mouth shut for Noah's sake until the night before the wedding. Noah showed up at my apartment around 11 at night with this bottle of cheap wine and said he had cold feet. I figured he was just nervous like most people get before their wedding. But then he said something that completely shook me. He goes, I feel like I'm marrying A total stranger. The only person who actually makes me feel like myself is you. I didn't sleep at all that night. I sat in my car outside the wedding venue at, like, five in the morning, completely torn between ruining my best friend's big day and saving him from what I knew was basically a lie. My phone kept buzzing with texts from other bridesmaids asking where I was for hair and makeup. But in the end, I didn't have to decide anything. Lauren never showed up. Noah stood at the altar for 20 minutes in his gray suit, looking confused while everyone whispered. Her maid of honor kept trying to call her. Finally, someone found a note in the bridal suite that just said she couldn't do it and she was sorry. The next day, Noah

My brother texted, stay out of our lives. I replied, fine. Then I kept the house I'd secretly bought them as their wedding gift. I'm the family provider, the one who got lucky with a successful company. My brother Wyatt is 28. Creative type, make beautiful furniture nobody buys. His fiance Alana teaches yoga and talks about energy like it's currency. I never trusted Alana. She'd say things that sounded sweet but felt sour. It must be nice never worrying about money like regular people. She'd smile while her eyes calculated what I was worth. Seven months ago, I bought a house in their dream neighborhood without telling them. Three bedrooms, original hardwood, a workshop space perfect for Wyatt. I paid cash and planned to transfer the deed at their wedding as the ultimate gift. The paperwork was all set. My lawyer had the transfer documents ready. All I needed was to wait for their September wedding and surprise them with keys and a bow. Wyatt had no idea about the house. I'd been careful to keep it secret. I even staged furniture shopping trips with him to see what he liked. At my company's summer party, I introduced Wyatt to potential clients. A woman who ran an interior design firm loved his work. Another owned a boutique hotel chain looking for custom pieces. I was networking for him like I always did. Alana watched from the bar with laser focus. She saw a conspiracy in every handshake and betrayal in every business card. Three days later, my phone exploded with messages from Wyatt. Alana had told him everything she'd witnessed. She claimed I'd been pushing women at him for months. She said I told them he was unhappy and looking to upgrade. The lies were specific and designed to wound. Said I called her a gold digger. To the hotel owner. She claimed I said Wyatt deserved someone with ambition. I tried calling Wyatt to explain. He sent me straight to voicemail. Then came his final message. That afternoon, Alana showed me what you've been doing. Stay out of our lives. After nearly three decades as brothers, I was deleted. I sat in my living room feeling oddly calm. I texted back. Fine. My next call was to my property lawyer. Kill the transfer papers for the house. But the wedding is next month. Plans changed. The house stays in my name. This is a significant financial decision. Are you certain? Completely certain. Four days later, Wyatt was pounding on my apartment door at 11 at night. We need to talk about the wedding. We're not talking. You made that clear. This is different. Where's the registry info? Alana's family keeps asking what registry? The one you set up for house stuff. Mom mentioned you were organizing something big. The irony was perfect. Quiet. I bought you a house. His face drained Of color. What do you mean, bought? Past tense. I was giving you and Alana a house for your wedding. Where is it? Still mine. You told me to stay out of your lives. That includes my gifts. Alana appeared behind him in the hallway. You can't take back what you already promised. I never promised you anything. The house was a surprise that never happened. This is

He said I was probably just jealous or trying to mess with him. So I did something I still feel guilty about. I sent him screenshots that Daniella had sent me. Screenshots showing the back end of the fake account with Daniela's email attached. Hudson blocked the Angela account immediately. He didn't come to school for three days. The day of his party arrived. Daniela still showed up with her laptop in her bag, hoping Hudson would show. But Hudson never came to his own birthday party. His mom apologized to everyone, saying he had food poisoning. Daniela was pissed. She kept checking her phone to see If Hudson had unblocked Angela that night, Daniela called me, furious. She figured out someone warned Hudson and suspected it was me. She asked if I would

My cousin called me last week to tell me that my boyfriend Matt wasn't invited to her wedding anymore because apparently he didn't match the aesthetic of her perfect Vineyard wedding. She actually said the words I need everyone in my photos to have a certain caliber and explained that Matt, with his contractor trucks and work boots wasn't giving the elevated vibe she needed. Then she hit me with a real kicker by saying I was only invited to the ceremony since technically I was extended family and she wanted to keep the reception for people who run in the same circles, not relatives. Her mom made her invite. I sat there listening to her explain how the reception was for her sorority sisters and investment banker friends while I tried not to laugh out loud. Eight months ago, she'd been sobbing to me about how every venue wanted $40,000 and her parents had given her a 20 thousand dollar budget already blown on her dress. I mentioned that Matt's parents owned a Vineyard venue and maybe I could ask about availability. She literally begged me to check. And when I told her they could do it, she screamed that I was the best cousin in the world and she'd never forget this. What she never bothered to figure out was that the only reason she got that venue basically free was because Matt's parents Adore me like I'm already their daughter. I spend every Sunday at their house for dinner helping his mom Linda with her garden. They were doing this as a massive favor, calling me their future daughter in law even though Matt and I aren't engaged yet. And gave my cousin the friends and family rate, which meant she only paid for staff and catering, not the actual 35,000 dollar venue fee. My cousin never asked how I got such an insane and deal and just assumed I knew somebody who knew somebody, while she posted constantly about her dream venue and how she manifested it through positive thinking. After she finished her speech about curating her guest list for the right energy, I told her I completely understood her vision and hung up. Then I called Linda, who answered on the first ring like always. I explained what my cousin had said about Matt not being the right caliber and how I was being hidden away during the ceremony like some embarrassing relative. Linda got so quiet I thought the call dropped, and then she said in that voice mothers use when they're about to destroy someone, that spoiled little princess is about to learn what happens when you bite the hand that feeds you. Linda asked if my cousin had signed an actual contract, and I told her no because we'd handled everything through texts. Since it was a family favor, she said she needed to make a quick Home call and would call me right back, but I could hear her muttering about ungrateful brats insulting her baby boy. Twenty minutes later Linda called back and said in her most fake upset voice that there had been a terrible mistake with a booking system and unfortunately they double booked that date with a Fortune 500 company retreat paying full price and since there was no formal contract, they'd have to go with a confirmed paying client. She said my cousin would be getting an apologetic call from their event coordinator within the hour, explaining that if she still wanted the venue, she'd need to pay the full rate of 35 thousand dollars plus a five thousand dollar rush fee or they'd have to release the date immediately. I tried to tell Linda she didn't have to go nuclear, but she cut me off and said honey, when someone tells me my son isn't good enough for their fancy pictures while using my property for free, they better pray I only take away the venue. She added that the coordinator would hopefully provide other venue options, which she knew were all either booked or charging 50,000 because she'd already called her friends who owned them. An hour later my

My friends were wasted and making increasingly stupid bets until my friend Ruby made one that beat them all. I want someone here to propose to a stranger, she said, dropping a ring pop on the table. The other girls giggled about how they'd never do it. I didn't really care until she dropped an offer so enticing I couldn't ignore it. I'll pay someone's entire semester tuition if they do it right now. Everyone went quiet. That was serious money. Not just propose, she added, grinning. You have to really sell it on your knee. The tears, the heartwarming speech, the whole thing. But I get to choose the guy. And you absolutely cannot tell him it's a bet. What if he says no? I asked curiously. Ruby shrugged. Doesn't matter. Just entertain us. I thought about it. I needed that money desperately. My parents were already working two jobs each. I took a deep breath and grabbed the ring pop. I'll do it. Ruby scanned the room. She grinned when her eyes landed on a guy in red flannel. My face immediately turned red. It was an old classmate I chased after an elementary school who pushed me when I tried to give him a Valentine's Day card one year. No way, I said, shaking my head. Choose someone else. Literally anyone else, I begged. Rubby shrugged. Like I said, entertain us. And that tuition is Yours, but I have a history with him. Then she said, it'll be very easy for him to say no again, and you win. She had a point. It was an easy win. My friends got their phones out, giggling and stumbling, ready to have the best story to tell around campus tomorrow. I downed a quick shot of tequila and made my way over. Before I could lose my nerve, I dropped down on one knee, pulled out the ring pop, and held it in front of me. Rico, I've liked you since elementary school. Let's skip the dating. I felt my stomach cartwheeling as the room fell silent watching us. I took another deep breath. Will you marry me? I shouted, glancing up at him. Rico's face went from confused to complete shock. Then he grinned. I thought you'd never ask. He pulled me up, dipped me like we were in some old movie, and kissed me. The entire bar exploded. People were cheering and buying us drink. During the chaos, he whispered, I don't know what this is, but I'm committed. My eyes widened. I stood there frozen, watching my friends stare back at me, looking equally shocked. This was not how it was supposed to go. I tried to run, but he caught my hand. Hey, where's my fiance going? I felt my head spinning. Just need some air. I managed. I tried avoiding Rico the next morning, but he still found me at the campus Coffee shop. So the girl who chased me with Valentine's cards finally got me, he said, sliding into the seat across from me. Took you long enough. I instantly sat up, surprised to see him again. Oh, god, it was real! He laughed. Very. It was a beautiful speech. I mean, let's get dating. Your pushy attitude hasn't changed, hey? I protested. He grinned. I'm glad you're still the same. I felt my heart skip a beat. Just before I could tell him about the bet, he pulled out his wallet and showed me a crumpled piece of paper. The Valentine's card I'd made him, with crooked hearts and misspelled words. I went back for it after I pushed you. Been carrying it around since we ended up at the same college. Guess I was waiting for you to ask again. I couldn't tell him, not with that card in his hand. Not when he seemed so sincere. So we started dating for real.

How did it end? I've been a school nurse for 12 years, and kids always tell me the wildest things. Most of the time, they tell me dramatic tales about invisible ninja attacks or cry about how their scraped knee surgery immediately. But one day, a little girl told me something that messed me up. Elena came limping in from recess with blood literally boring down her shin from where she'd fallen off the monkey bars. She was this tiny little thing with huge brown eyes. She jumped up on my table like nothing happened, even though her knee looked like someone had taken a cheese grater to it. I quickly grabbed my supplies and started cleaning it with the antiseptic that burns like absolute hell when it touches cuts. Elena just sat there humming some TikTok song while I worked on getting chunks of gravel out of her knee. You're being so brave, sweetie, I told her. She smiled at me with this proud little grin and said, Cole taught me that being quiet when something hurts means you're winning. Winners get the best prizes, like McDonald's or staying up past bedtime. I kept working, but something about how she said it made every alarm bell in my head start screaming. That's interesting, honey. Who's Cole? I asked while reaching for the antibiotic ointment. He's my mommy's boyfriend. He watches me every day after school. Elena held Perfectly still while I spread the ointment on her knee. Cole says I'm getting really good at the cigarette game. Last week I lasted 43 seconds, which is longer than he thought a little kid do it. My hand froze halfway through opening a bandage, and I felt like I was going to puke. What's the cigarette game? I asked, trying to keep my voice normal. Elena rolled up her sleeve, and I literally had to grab the desk to keep from falling over. Her entire little arm, from wrist to shoulder, had at least 30 perfect circle burns in neat rows like some psychos art project. It's when Cole puts his cigarette on my arm and checks how long I can stay quiet. If I make noise before the timer goes off, I have to sleep in the garage with no blanket. But if I win, I get to pick what we watch on TV. Last time I got to watch two episodes of my show because I'm getting so good at it. As soon as Elena left my office with her knee wrapped up and a lollipop in her hand, I locked my door and called Child Protective Services. My voice was shaking so bad the operator could barely understand me as I told them what Elena had said. They had someone at our school in 30 minutes to talk to Elena. Elena told them everything like she was talking about her favorite TV show or something. Cole Had been burning her since she was 5 years old to toughen her up because he said the world wasn't nice to weak people. He made her stand naked in the garage while he burned her with cigarettes, lighters, and hot metal spoons. The worst part was he'd started bringing his friends over to watch the games and bet on how long she could last before she screamed. The cops arrested Cole at his job and found the most disturbing stuff I've ever heard about on his computer. There were over 500 videos of Elena being tortured, with titles like Teaching Her Place and Breaking Baby Girl, with dates going back two years. He had plans to start using a blowtorch because

My husband threw his beer bottle in the sink, pointing at the moldy dishes. Our son left for a week. He's 19 and you still wake him up for work? Then the real problem dropped when he showed me a text from his girlfriend's mom. She asked if he has special needs because he brought laundry to their house and didn't know which button started the washer. My face burned while I listened to him. You make his appointments, pack his lunch, pay everything while my boss's son just bought a condo. At that moment, our son was passed out on the couch at 2 p m, Xbox controller on his chest, wearing 3 day old pajamas. Cut him off or I'm filing for divorce. Seriously, this has gone too far. That threat made something snap inside me. Fine. Tomorrow he's on his own, I said. Next morning, our son found nothing but a sticky note where breakfast usually waited. Adults buy their own food. His phone died during his job interview call because I killed service at 5:00am. His interview suit sat soaking in the washer for two hours until he needed to leave when he pounded on my door screaming about losing the job opportunity that paid $25 an hour, turned up my podcast and grit my teeth. Three days later, smoke detector screamed at 1:00am because he'd set spaghetti On fire, destroying my grandmother's cast iron pot she carried from Italy. I watched him wave a pizza box at the ceiling while pasta flames licked the cabinet. Pasta can't actually catch fire was the crazy thing. My husband laughed. He's learning. Day 5, our son lost his warehouse job without car insurance. To drive there, he had to walk four miles in boots that shredded, his feet bloody when I passed him limping through rain, knowing he'd miss. And without that job, I kept driving. Week two, he sold his Xbox for $150 to avoid eviction. He was down 10 pounds from eating stolen ramen, working three jobs, including overnight toilet cleaning. I even found him unconscious standing against a bus stop one day. That same evening, my husband left for poker, saying, this builds character, while our son texted, whatever I did wrong, I'm sorry. I couldn't see the road through tears. Then the 2:00am hospital call stopped my heart. Your son collapsed at work from severe exhaustion. When I got to the hospital, he told me even worse news. He had moved in with a boy we knew, a dealer we'd protected him from for years. The nurses found track marks between his toes, not from drugs, but stolen diabetic lancets. Because high sodium from all the ramen he ate made him think he was going crazy. The doctor said another week of just Oman would have meant organ failure. My husband showed up drunk from the Late night poker, but still annoyed about leaving early. That's when everything exploded. Where were you? Our son's voice cracked from the hospital bed. For interviews. First days, any day. The truth or doubt. My son listed every abandoned baseball game, every stuck in traffic lie, every birthday his father forgot existed. I'd covered those wounds with Band Aids until I realized the bleeding would never stop. The truth sat between us like a court. I hadn't been babying anyone. I've been desperately trying to give my son one functioning parent since his father checked out years ago. My husband stood there in the hospital room, swaying from poker night whiskey.

They forgot the exit clause in my founders agreement that stated any adverse change to my compensation triggered a mandatory 25 million dollar penalty. I knew they'd screwed up the moment I saw that cold corporate email. Due to evolving fiscal priorities, your pension benefits are temporarily suspended. No phone call, no explanation. Just a chatbot message for someone who helped build this company from nothing. I sat in my kitchen, toast getting cold, reading it again and again. 30 years of weekends, crises, and late nights, and this is how they repay me? Like I was just another line item to cut? The email came from Jennifer Walsh, some 28 year old VP who probably thinks I'm just another old timer collecting dust and accounting. She's never heard the stories about how I mortgage my house three times to keep payroll running in O A. Never knew about the Christmas I spent in the server room fixing a catastrophic data breach while everyone else was home opening presents. But here's what they forgot. I'm not just any employee. I'm a founder. I walked to my kitchen cabinet, the one where old papers go to die, and pulled out a dusty black binder. My original founder's agreement from 2001. I flipped to page 47, clause 14 D. Any material adverse change to compensation triggers immediate Severance payout of $25 million, payable within 72 business hours. My old lawyer, Bruce insisted On it. Back when we were worth nothing. Four of us in a garage, surviving on ramen and spite. Ellen, he said, pouring cheap whiskey into coffee mugs. Someday this company will get big and stupid. When it does, you'll want a kill switch. We laughed about it then. 25 million felt like monopoly money. Now the company is worth 2.8 billion. I called my current lawyer, Charles. Is clause 14 D still active? Three hour callback. Ellen, they never avoided it. In fact, when they restructured executive compensation in 2019, your original agreement was specifically exempted. They're completely screwed. That's when I smiled for the first time in weeks. I drafted one simple email to HR due to pension freeze. Per HR, 4 5 to 6 B, invoking clause 14 D. Per founders agreement, please confirm wire transfer timeline. E. Morrison, Co founder. I added my old title just to watch them scramble. Sent it at 9:00am on a Tuesday. At 10:15, my phone started buzzing. Unknown numbers, frantic voicemails from people I hadn't heard from in years. Word was spreading through the executive floors like wildfire. The CFO called at 11:00am. His voice was shaking. Ellen, we need to talk. This is. This is serious. About what? I asked. Drinking my tea. Watching squirrels fight over bird seed in my backyard. The.

My brother was born when doctors said my mom couldn't have more kids. They called him their miracle baby. I was 7 and suddenly invisible. For my 10th birthday, I asked to go to Dave and Buster's. They took my brother shopping for school clothes instead. Your birthday can wait, mom said. It never got rescheduled. By high school, the pattern was set. He'd break something, blame me, and I'd get found it. He failed every class, but got a BMW for his 18th birthday. I was valedictorian and got a card. They skipped my graduation because he felt left out and needed a beach day. I stayed home during college to save money, working two jobs while finishing my degree. Every morning, my brother would jingle his BMW keys at me. Still taking the bus. Loser. After six months of overtime shifts, I finally had enough for a down payment. My friend's dad owned a used car dealership and cut me a deal on a blue Dodge Challenger. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. First thing I'd ever owned that my parents hadn't touched. Parked it in the driveway that night, put the keys on my dresser and took about 50 photos. Even posted one on Instagram with the caption earned, not given. Next morning, the keys were gone. So was the car. So was my brother. He probably just borrowed it, mom said, not looking up from making His favorite breakfast. You know how boys are. He stole my car. Family doesn't steal from family. Three hours later, I heard the engine. My brother pulled up in my challenger. Except the front bumper was dragging, the passenger mirror was gone, and there was a cracked spider webbing across the windshield. He tossed me the keys. Your car is junk, bro. Fell apart on the highway. You should get your money back. I stared at the damage. You crashed it. Prove it. My parents immediately sided with him. Dad actually said I should apologize for accusing him of lying. Mom suggested I let my brother borrow it whenever, since he's used to nicer cars and did you a favor by testing it. I walked inside, pulled up my phone, and called 9 1 1. I'd like to report a stolen vehicle that's just been returned damaged. My mother lunged for my phone. What are you doing? Exactly what you do if a stranger stole and crashed your car. Cops arrived in 20 minutes. My brother was smirking until I pulled up the dash cam footage I'd uploaded to the cloud. See, I'd installed cameras the day I bought it, not because I'm psychic, but because I park it in a neighborhood where cars get broken into. The footage showed everything. Him hot wiring it at 3:00am, drag racing down the interstate, T boning a stop sign, laughing as he surveyed the damage, even calling his friend to brag about Teaching me a lesson. The officers watched 30 seconds before cuffing him. This is grand theft auto and reckless endangerment. One said. The damage alone makes it a felony. My parents went nuclear. Mom screaming about family loyalty, dad threatening to kick me out. My brother just staring at me like he could and comprehend consequences existed. He's your brother, mom sobbed. Then he should have acted like it. The best part came during the trial. My brother's lawyer tried arguing it was a family dispute. Then the prosecutor played the dash cam audio, where my brother said, I hope this teaches him. He'll never have.

She thought I was going to cry, but I smiled. Then dad came in, shouting at me. Where are the $15,000 we prepared for your sister's college? My name is Valerie, and I'm 22, still living at home while saving money from my job at a tech startup. My sister Bella is 19 and in college, getting everything handed to her while I had to work my way through school. Last month, our parents hit financial trouble when Dad's business took a. They've been secretly selling family heirlooms and mom's jewelry to scrape together Bella's tuition. They got exactly $15,000 in cash. I watched dad count those bills with shaking hands. Grandma's wedding ring, the antique watch, your mother's pearls. Everything we had left, he whispered to mom. Mom was crying quietly. At least Bella won't have to drop out. She doesn't need to know what we sacrificed. Dad asked me to deposit it at the bank since he had client meetings trying to save his business. I placed the envelope in my desk drawer under textbooks, planning to go after work. When I got home, Bella was strutting around our living room like she owned the place. She had a brand new designer handbag, expensive clothes with tags attached, and the latest iPhone Pro Max. She was on the phone, twirling around in her new outfit. Yeah, babe, I sent you the $8,000 like I promised. For your car payments. Don't worry about paying it back right away. My heart sank. I ran to my room, yanking open the desk drawer. I searched frantically. The envelope was gone. I stared at the empty drawer, hands shaking. All those family measures sold for nothing. Bella, where's the money from my desk? She rolled her eyes like I was being dramatic. Oh, that. I found it just sitting there when I came home early to surprise everyone. I figured it was family money just lying around. I'm family, right? She held up her new phone and took a selfie, then showed me the screen. You should see your face right now. You look absolutely insane. This is hilarious. I watched her posing with her designer bags, completely oblivious to what she'd done. She'd sent $8,000 to some boyfriend I'd never even met, spent thousands more on herself, and was treating it like a joke. Instead of screaming or crying like she clearly expected, I smiled a calm, knowing smile. You're absolutely right. It is family money. That's when we heard Dad's truck pull into the driveway. His engine was making that grinding noise again, the one he couldn't afford to fix. Dad walked in through the front door, his face already red from stress about his failing business. His work clothes were dusty. His hands were rough from taking on manual labor jobs to make ends meet. Valerie, did you deposit the money? The tuition payment is due. Tomorrow morning. And he stopped mid sentence, his eyes landing on Bella's shopping bag scattered across the living room floor. His gaze moved from the designer handbag to her new clothes.

So I said, good to know and walked out. Packed a bag, threw my keys on the table, texted her, call him then. You're his problem now. The panicked I was joking messages flooded in immediately. Here's the thing. We split rent fifty fifty. But I've been paying 70% because I make more. Plus all utilities and groceries. I texted back, I'll pay exactly 50% from now on. Figure out the rest. I can't afford that. You know I can't. Too bad. Should have thought about that before the comparison. But here's where it gets interesting. Saturday, I went to get my stuff, and she's in full makeup, trying to seduce me back. Can we just talk first? No. Just here for my Xbox while packing. She drops the bomb. Fine. Leave. Devin already reached out anyway. Cool. Hope he knows what he's doing. I genuinely didn't care. But she had already told him we were on a break. His actual girlfriend, Alyssa found out, sent me screenshots of Jenna trying to hook up with him. I forwarded everything to Alyssa. She confronted Devin with receipts. He blocked Jenna completely. Now she's sending emails. You ruined everything! I'm going homeless because of you! My response? Tell everyone the truth. That you compared me to your ex in bed. And I left. See how that goes? Radio silence for exactly three days. Then the real desperation kicked In she started calling my job. Pretend to be worried about me. Hi, this is his girlfriend Jenna. He hasn't been home in weeks. Is he okay? Is he eating? My manager pulled me aside asking if everything was alright. We broke up, I said. He just nodded, but Jenna wasn't done. She called my mom next, spinning some story about how I abandoned her during a rough patch. My mom listened patiently, then asked, honey, what exactly did you say to make him leave? Jenna actually told her. My own mother laughed and said, well, did you call your ex yet? Then came the social media campaign. Vague posts about toxic men who can't handle honest communication and people who abandon you when you need them most. Friends were eating it up in the comments with fire emojis and you deserve better, queen messages. But here's what she didn't expect. Our mutual friends started asking questions. What actually happened? What did she say? She couldn't answer without admitting the truth, so she just kept deflecting with more victim posts. Meanwhile, I'm living my best life. Got a studio apartment downtown, no drama, gaming setup looks incredible. Posted a picture of my new place with the caption peaceful vibes only. Jenna commented within minutes. Must be nice to run away from your problems. I replied, must be nice to have your ex handle them for you. She deleted the comment immediately, but screenshots live forever. Our friends saw everything. Week Three things escalated. Her best friend Jessica reached out. Jenna's really struggling. Can't you just help with rent this month? I sent Jess

When I was 14, I had been begging my parents for a service dog for months. My anxiety had gotten so bad that I couldn't even walk into school without hyperventilating in the parking lot. My therapist told them it would help, but they kept saying no. Dad always said dogs were too much work and too expensive. Mom claimed I was just exaggerating my anxiety to skip school. Dad would joke around dinner. If you're too anxious to go to school, how are you gonna walk a dog every day? So when my Jake called and said his friend couldn't keep their Labrador mix, Scout anymore, I said yes without asking. Scout was already trained for emotional support stuff. I met Jake at the park that Tuesday and walked home with this golden brown dog, who immediately started following me around like we'd known each other forever. My parents lost their minds when I walked through the door. Mom started yelling about responsibility and vet bills. Dad was pacing around the kitchen saying I couldn't just bring home random animals. They were so mad, they could barely speak to me during dinner. But then dad got this idea. He said I could keep Scout for exactly one week to prove I couldn't handle it. He even pulled out this little blue notebook and started writing down everything I did wrong day one. He wrote that I forgot to fill the water. Bowl before school. Day two, he noted that Scout tracked MUD on the carpet. But something weird started happening the first night Scout was there. I didn't have my usual 3:00am panic attack where I'd end up crying under my blanket. Instead, when I started feeling that familiar tightness in my chest around midnight, Scout jumped onto my bed and put his head right on my chest. His weight was warm and heavy, and somehow my breathing just slowed down. The next morning at breakfast, mom asked why I looked so rested. I told her about Scout helping me sleep, but she just rolled her eyes and said it was probably just the excitement of getting what I wanted. Day three was when things got real. I had this math tutoring session with Mr. Peterson that usually left me in tears because I'd get so anxious about making mistakes. This time, I brought Scout with me. Mr. Peterson seemed annoyed at first, but then something crazy happened. Every time I started bouncing my leg or my breathing got fast, scout would gently pat my arm. It was like he could feel my anxiety building before I even realized it was happening. I actually solved three problems that day without crying. Mr. Peterson looked shocked. I told my parents later that he'd never seen me so calm and focused. Day 4 was the real test, though. I had to meet with Missus Collins, the school counsellor, because I'd been missing. So Many classes. Usually these meetings made me wanna throw up. But Scout came with me. He sat right next to my chair. And when Missus Collins started asking about my attendance, I felt that familiar panic rising. But Scout immediately put his paw on my leg and looked right at me. Missus Collins noticed everything. She watched how Scout would nudge me when I started fidgeting. How he'd rest his head against my leg when my voice got shaky. After 20 minutes, she asked to speak with my parents. That evening, she called them and said something that changed everything. My daughter is a completely different person with this dog. This isn't some teenage phase or a crutch she's using to avoid responsibility. This animal is giving her a bridge to function normally. Dad still tried to stick to his one week rule. He kept writing in his stupid notebook. But I noticed the complaints were getting smaller. Left Scouts toy in hallway or dog hair on couch. Nothing about me being irresponsible anymore. Then on day 6, something happened that nobody expected.

I was 17 when I realized my mom was literally trying to kill me. And it all started with a box cutter under my pillow. Growing up, my parents always said I was difficult. Mom would tell neighbors how I cried all the time as a baby. They could never have people over because of the noise. As a teenager, I thought they were just strict. No video games, no sleepovers. Couldn't be alone with my little sister Maya. They said I was dangerous when upset. One Tuesday morning, I stayed home sick from school. Stomach bug or something. I was in the kitchen grabbing cereal when I heard mom on the phone in the living room. She was talking about a life insurance policy. Not weird by itself, but then she said something that made my blood freeze. I don't care what the therapist says. We had to test him, and he failed again. Test me? What kind of test? I crept closer to listen, but she hung up when she saw me. She just smiled and asked if I felt better. Like nothing happened. That night, I pretended to sleep, but kept one eye open. Around midnight, I heard my bedroom window click, then soft footsteps. Mom had unlocked my window from outside and was tiptoeing toward my bed. She slipped something under my pillow, then crept back out. The next morning, she acted totally normal. Made Pancakes, asked about homework, the usual mom stuff. But when I reached under my pillow, my fingers found cold metal. A box cutter with the blade already extended. I stared at it for, like, 10 minutes. She wanted me to find it, to touch it. Maybe cut myself accidentally or on purpose. Something told me this wasn't the first time. I just never noticed before. Instead of touching it more, I wrapped it in a shirt and took it to school. Handed it straight to Mister Garcia, our guidance counselor. He asked where I got it, and I told him everything. Within two hours, CPS was called. The investigation was insane. Turns out my childhood trauma diagnosis was real. But my parents had been faking compliance with treatment for years. They take me to therapy, not along with the recommendations, then do the opposite at home. But the box cutter thing was worse than I thought. Mom had been documenting it in this private Facebook group for parents with troubled kids. Screenshots showed her posting about putting dangerous objects near me to see what I do. Other parents encouraged her to speed things up so I wouldn't ruin their lives. The most messed up part? She'd been taking out life insurance policies using my Social Security number under fake names. One policy specifically paid out for accidental fall or self harm. Like she was literally betting on me dying. My dad knew everything. He helped planet. They both got arrested. That same week, I went to live with my Aunt Rebecca in another state. She showed me the police report later. My parents had been doing this stuff since I was 12. Little tests.

We're halfway through freshman year and my friends still grabbed my wrist to show people how their fingers overlap or joke that I could share my metabolism with them. Not kidding. Last week my roommate Leah literally put extra fries on my plate when I wasn't looking. Because someone needs to feed you, babe. Finding this friend group three months into college felt like finally breathing. They adopted me instantly. Leah pulling me into their booth at the dining hall, Sophie looping her arm through mine at parties. At every party they joke I was their pocket size Friend. Leah makes comments like eat a burger, skinny! Whenever we go out. For months. It was relentless, but weirdly affectionate. You're gonna blow away. Real women have curves. Bones are for dogs. Every meal with commentary how are you full already? Must be nice to eat whatever you want. from their guy friend group literally picked me up with one arm once just to prove he could. But it felt like belonging. Like finally having friends who cared enough to tease me. Besides bringing up my celiac seems dramatic. I'd rather take the skinny jokes than be the friend who needs special accommodations. Then three weeks ago, something shifted. The comments stopped. No more eat a burger jokes, no more grabbing my wrists. Instead, they got weird, careful, like they were walking on eggshells. Leah started buying extra snacks for the Room, casually leaving them on my desk. Sophie stopped making the metabolism jokes based with random compliments about my personality. Olivia began suggesting restaurants with lots of options. When we went out Thursday night, I'm coming back early from Bio Lab, and I hear them through the door. Our whole crew is in there. Leah, Sophie, Olivia, Jade, Addison. They never hang without me. Saturday at the pregame, before everyone else shows up, Leah's saying we have to be supportive but direct. The signs were all there. Jade says she never finishes meals, goes to the bathroom right after eating. She's getting thinner. My heart stops. They think I'm bulimic. Madison adds something about nutrition labels and restrictive behavior. Leah's voice gets soft. Talking about doing this with love. They're planning an intervention for me. I text Sam from home about what I just heard. She asks what they could possibly be staging an intervention for, and when I tell her they think I'm bulimic, she points out the obvious. It's because of my celiac. But they don't know about that. She tells me to just tell them. But I have a better idea. I'm going to make a point. Saturday arrives. I've been at the library all day, giving them time to set up. At 5:45, I hit up the only gluten free place in town and order everything. Three pizza is garlic bread brownies. At six PM, I walk in with my hall plus vodka. My friends are Arranged in our common room in a suspicious circle. Leah is in the middle, looking nervous. Sophie has tissues ready. Olivia is holding printed Webmd articles. Hey, babes. Ready to pregame? I brought pizza. The confusion is instant. I start unpacking, opening the first box. I wanted to talk first. Leah says carefully. Sure. I grab a slice, taking a huge bite. What's up? They exchange looks. Sophie takes a breath. We're worried about you. Oh, my god, me too. I say, grabbing a second slice. Do you know how hard freshman year is when you can't eat anything on campus? What? Olivia says, yeah. Turns out when you have celiac disease, eating gluten makes your immune system attack your intestines. Fun fact, I'm demolishing the pizza now. All those times you told me to eat a burger, I literally couldn't. I be hospitalized. Leah's mouth falls open. Celia, those bathroom trips you're tracking? That's after someone contaminated my food with gluten. Or when the dining hall mixes up spoons. Or when Tyler put beer in my juice as a joke. But you're so thin. Sophie whispers. Yeah, because the only thing that won't literally poison me is like.

The doctor said, no heavy lifting for eight weeks. I'm stuck taking care of him when I could be with James. I've been with Rachel for four years, engaged for 1. She'd always been supportive during my chronic back problems, or so I thought. After my neurosurgeon recommended spinal fusion, Rachel drove me to the hospital, held my hand during prep, and was the last face I saw before anesthesia. I have a weird reaction to anesthesia. I regained consciousness quickly, but remained physically still. I became aware in recovery, maybe 30 minutes after surgery. Eyes closed, breathing slow, but I could hear everything. Then I heard Rachel's voice near my bed. He's still out, she told someone. Before I could signal I was awake, I heard her friend. Ali arrived. How did it go? Ali asked. Fine, I guess, Rachel replied, sounding annoyed rather than concerned. The doctor said, no heavy lifting for eight weeks. I'm stuck taking care of him when I could be with James. James? I didn't know any James. Why not leave? Ali asked quietly. You're not married yet. Rachel paused, then his parents are adding me to their will next month. You know how loaded they are. The old man's health isn't great. Probably why they're updating everything. I just need to get out a little longer. My parents, my father, who built a construction company from nothing, My mother, who taught school for 30 years. The people who'd welcomed Rachel with open arms and insisted on paying for our wedding. That's cold, Ra, even for you, Ali said. It's practical, Rachel replied. Four years listening to him talk about building projects and football, playing nice with his boring family. And now I have to play nurse for two months. What about James? James will wait. Once everything is legal and Richard senior kicks it, I'll be set. James can have his fun now, but he knows the score. Richard senior kicks it. My father. They were discussing my father's death like a business plan. What if Mike wakes up and hears you? Ali asked. Rachel laughed. Cold, sharp, please. They pump him so full of drugs, he'll be lucky to remember his name. Besides, he trusts me completely. It's almost too easy. I decided to keep playing unconscious. The nurse checked my vitals. I woke up slowly, playing the part they expected. Rachel was immediately by my side. Hey, babe. Everything went great. How are you feeling? Tired, I mumbled. I'm right here. I'll take good care of you. The next few hours, Rachel played devoted fiance perfectly. When visiting hours ended, she kissed my forehead and promised to return in the morning. As soon as she left, I called my parents. Come immediately. It's important. But I'm physically okay. They heard something in my voice and arrived in 30 minutes. I told them everything. James, the Will the death planning? My mother gasped. My father's face turned red. We coordinated immediately. My friend Eric packed all Rachel's belongings into storage. A locksmith changed my apartment locks. At 11 p m, my father's attorney removed Rachel from all state documents. My mother called Rachel's parents. They were horrified. I texted Rachel, change of plans. My parents are taking me home tomorrow. Don't come to the hospital. Her reply, don't be silly, babe. I'll be there at 9:00. I didn't respond. Next morning, my parents discharged me at 8:15 a m. At 9:07, Rachel called. I didn't answer. By 10 a m, she called. Twelve

So I showed her I will not sustain her lifestyle. I walked through the door after another grueling 12 hour day, my shoulders heavy with exhaustion. All I wanted was a hot meal, a moment of peace and maybe some genuine time with my wife. Instead, I was greeted by that familiar silence and the distinct aroma of reheated takeout. Again, the dining table was cluttered with shopping bags from high end stores, their designer logos practically screaming expense. The irony hit me like a punch to the gut. Here I was, breaking my back to provide while she lounged on the couch scrolling through her phone, not even bothering to acknowledge I'd walk through the door. What's for dinner? I asked, trying to keep my tone light. She didn't look up. I ordered something. It'll be here soon. This had become our pattern. The home cooked meals were distant memories. The house was slipping into chaos. Dishes piled up, laundry unfolded, floors uncleaned. For weeks I worked extra projects, endured sleepless nights to ensure we lived comfortably. What did I get? A wife who didn't care about maintaining our home or acknowledging my effort. That evening I decided to address it. We need to talk. I can't keep doing this alone. I need your support. Her response hit hard. I didn't marry you to be your maid or personal chef. If you want that, hire someone. This wasn't the woman. I married. When I tried to reason with her, she dismissed me, saying she had better things to do than argue about nonsense. She wasn't just neglecting the house. She was neglecting us. I felt like an ATM funding her lifestyle. The next morning, something snapped. I don't think you understand how this affects me, I said over coffee. I come home exhausted, and I'm the only one pulling weight. She was scrolling her phone. I'm not your maid. I'm not here to cater to your whims. I'm asking for a partner, someone who contributes and cares about this relationship. Her laugh was bitter. You think this is partnership? I didn't sign up to be your servant. I have my own life. If you don't like it, that's your problem. What about us? Do you even care what's happening to us beside dramatically? If you want a housewife who does everything, you married the wrong woman. I'm not changing because you're feeling unappreciated. To her marriage was a transaction. My work financing her lifestyle while she lived. Responsible, ability free. By the time I got home, I decided if she wouldn't change, I would. I grabbed my laptop and logged into our accounts. While she watched TV, I canceled her extra credit cards, leaving one with strict limits. That evening, she stormed in, holding her phone. Why is my card being declined? I adjusted the limits.

Mom chose her boyfriend Rufus over me when I was 16. He claimed I stole his Rolex, which was ridiculous since he pawned it weeks earlier for casino money. Rufus gave mom an ultimatum that night. Either she goes or I go. Mom didn't even hesitate. She packed my clothes and trash bags while I was at school and changed the locks. When I got home, my stuff was on the lawn getting soaked by sprinklers. I spent three weeks sleeping in a 24 hour laundromat. The owner eventually caught me, but instead of kicking me out, he offered me a job cleaning his other properties. That's how I met Mister Thief, a 73 year old man who was more powerful than I could have thought. His daughter had died at 17 in a car accident years earlier. When he found me scrubbing his toilets at 2:00am for grocery money, something in his eyes change. Within a month, he moved me into one of his vacant luxury condos. Not some rundown unit, but a penthouse he usually rented for $5,000 a month. Mr. Thys brought me dinner every night, helped with homework, and taught me the property business. Other kids were learning to parallel park. I was learning to negotiate lease agreements and manage construction crews. He paid for my prom dress, my college tuition, even walked me down the aisle at my wedding for Five years. He was the father I never had. When he died of a heart attack, he left me everything. 47 rental properties worth $18 million. I was 21 and suddenly one of the largest property owners in the city. I tried reaching out to mom once during those years. Invited her to my high school graduation. She never showed. Drove by the house one Christmas Eve and saw her through the window laughing with Rufus. I knocked for 10 minutes. She looked right at me through the glass and closed the curtain. Mom's sister called me when I was 25. Said mom and Rufus were begging family members for money again, asking if I had anything to spare. They've hit up everyone. Cousins, co workers, even Rufus's ex wife. I hung up and never asked about them again. Then yesterday, mom showed up at my office. No call, no warning. Just walked past my secretary with Rufus trailing behind. They look terrible. Mom had aged 20 years and 12, and Rufus's gut hung over his belt like he drunk two cases of beer. They stood in my office doorway. I knew immediately this wasn't about making amends. They were getting evicted at the end of the month and needed a place to live. Mom demanded I give them one of my properties her sister told her about. Rent free. Obviously because children don't abandon their parents. The same woman who threw me out like trash was lecturing me about abandonment. She even wanted her name on several deeds for tax purposes. When I said, I think about it, she appeared at my office building every morning with a sign saying, my daughter owns 47 properties, but lets me be homeless. Security dragged them out, but not before she yelled at the top of her lungs that I was mentally unstable and stole Mister Theese's fortune. She even showed up at Mister Theese's grave with flowers, telling mourners he was his real daughter. The woman who abandoned her child was trying to destroy the life I built without her. After 24 hours of harassment, I'd had enough. I called my lawyer and got the paperwork I'd hoped I'd never need. Then I asked my property manager, August, to drive with me to their apartment. I needed a witness for what was about to happen. The three hour drive gave me time to think about everything Mister Feast had told me. Success is the best revenge. But sometimes you need to show people the consequences of their choices. We pulled up to a

I found out when my new neighbour declared war on my sick daughter's magical night garden. My seven year old daughter, Lily, has a rare skin condition. To put it simply, the sun hurts her. She can only play outside in the deep twilight just as the last bits of sun disappear. Because of this, her world was mostly indoors. To give her a little piece of magic that was just hers, we built a special garden in our backyard. It was a moon garden filled with flowers like moon flowers and evening Primrose that only bloomed at night. We strung up soft twinkling fairy lights and for an hour or so each evening, Lily could be a normal kid in her enchanted space. It was the one thing that brought her pure joy. Then Mister Henderson moved in next door. At first he seemed fine. Just a quiet, grumpy looking man. About a week after he moved in, he installed a security light on the side of his garage. But this wasn't a normal light. Normal, uh, it was a commercial grade stadium style floodlight. A miniature sun. When he turned it on that first night, it blasted our entire backyard with harsh blue white light, completely washing out the fairy lights and bleaching the grass. I walked over the next day and knocked on his door. I explained very politely about Lily's condition and her special garden. I asked If he might consider angling the light downwards so it only covered his property. He just stared at me. It's for my security, he said flatly. I need to see my whole property line. I tried again, my voice gentle. I understand. But it's just so bright. It's ruining my daughter's only safe place to play. He actually scoffed. Not my problem. Your kid needs to toughen up. The world's a bright place. Then he closed the door in my face. The effect was immediate and devastating. The harsh light never turned off. Running from dusk until dawn, Lily's moonflowers, which needed darkness to open, stayed tightly shut, then began to wilt. She would just stand at her window, tears in her eyes, watching her magical garden die. The light was so powerful, it even cut through her blackout curtains, making it hard for her to sleep. My heart broke every single night. I tried everything. I called the city, hoping to file a nuisance complaint. Sent an officer out who measured the light. Mister Henderson had done his research. The light was exactly 1 lumen, under the legal limit to be considered a violation. It was completely legal. I even saw him watching from his window as the officer explained this to me, a smug little smirk on his face. He was enjoying this. He was enjoying taking away a sick little girl's only happiness. Two weeks. I felt utterly helpless. I was looking out the window at the Wilting flowers and my daughter's sad face. And then I saw my own reflection in the glass. The reflection of the light. And that's when the idea sparked. It wasn't about fighting the light. It was about redirecting it. That Saturday, I went to a specialty hardware store. I didn't buy fences or trees. I bought three huge 4 by 8 foot sheets of polished mirror acrylic, the kind they use for dance studios. I also bought lumber, heavy duty locking wheels and a box of screws. My wife thought I was losing my mind as I spent the entire weekend in the garage measuring, sawing, and building. I constructed three tall, sturdy panels on wheels, each one a giant movable mirror. That night, his floodlight clicked on at dusk, as usual, bathing our yard in that horrible glare. I said nothing. I just calmly wheeled my three mirror panels out onto the patio. The only sound was the soft rumble of the wheels on the stone. I took my time, carefully.

My dad is the quietest, most patient man I have ever met. He waits his turn in line, never complains about bad service, and thinks a heated debate is disagreeing on what toppings to get on a pizza. But I Learned that day that even the most patient man has a breaking point. And my dad's breaking point was a smug storage unit manager named Kevin. We were in the middle of a huge move. Our new house wasn't ready, so we had to put every single thing we owned into a storage unit for one month. We're talking my entire childhood in boxes. My mom's wedding dress, old family photos, my grandfather's war medals. Everything that mattered to us was in that 10 by 15 foot metal box. We paid the first month's rent on time, got our key, and didn't think about it again. A month later, our moving truck was scheduled to arrive at the storage facility at 11 a m. To load everything up. We got there at 10:30, ready to go, but our key wouldn't turn in the lock. That's when we saw it. Our standard silver padlock was gone, and in its place was a huge, thick, circular red lock. It looks like something you'd see on a bank vault. Confused, we walked to the front office. The air inside smelled like stale coffee and cheap air freshener. A man with a greasy ponytail and A name tag that said Kevin was sitting behind the counter scrolling on his phone. My dad calmly explained the situation. Hi, we're in unit 3B. It seems our lock has been changed. Kevin didn't even look up from his phone. Unit 3B, you're late on your payment. That can't be right, my mom said, pulling out her phone. The payment came out of our account two weeks ago. See? She showed him the clear as day bank statement. Kevin finally looked up, glanced at the phone, and shrugged. My computer says you didn't pay. So you didn't pay. He took a long, loud sip from a giant plastic mug. The computer automatically puts a company lock on any delinquent unit. To get it removed, you'll have to pay this month's rent again. Plus a fifty dollar lady and a seventy five dollar lock removal fee. My dad took a deep studying breath. I could see the muscle in his jaw twitch. Sir, we have proof of payment right here and our moving truck will be here in 20 minutes. We need to get our things. Kevin leaned back in his squeaky chair and smirked. Look, I just work here. The computer says you owe us money. Pay it or don't, your stuff stays right where it is. The condescending tone was what did it. My dad, ever the believer in process, asked for the corporate office's number. Kevin lazily wrote it on a sticky note. My dad called and Was immediately put on hold. We stood there in that stuffy office for what felt like an eternity, listening to terrible, tinny hold music. The moving truck driver called my dad's phone. Hey, I'm here. Where are you guys at? The pressure was mounting. My mom was starting to pace, her face pale with stress. After 25 agonizing minutes, a cheerful voice from corporate finally answered. My dad explained the entire situation, bank statements and all. The corporate drone listened and then said, I understand your frustration, sir, but we can't do anything from our end. You'll need the onsite manager to verify the payment issue and override the system. The onsite manager is Kevin, my dad said, his voice dangerously low. He's the one refusing to help. Well, I'd be happy to transfer you to his office line. The voice offered. And before my dad could protest, we were listening to a phone ringing on Kevin's desk, which he completely ignored while staring right at us. Call went to voicemail. It was a perfect, unbreakable loop of corporate nonsense. My dad slowly lowered his phone. The look on his face had changed. The patience was gone. He didn't say a word to Kevin. He just turned, looked at my mom, who was now quietly crying, and walked out of the office. We followed him to our old station wagon, thinking he

Where did you get the money? Family meeting tomorrow, six PM. They had no idea what was coming. I'm Marcus, 26, and I've been the invisible son for years. While my parents throw Celebration parties every time my younger sister Emma gets a participation trophy in her dance classes. I quietly became the youngest regional sales director at a tech startup, making serious money. The favoritism has been absolutely insane my entire life. When Emma wanted to try violin at 15, they bought her a two thousand dollar instrument without hesitation. When I asked for help with college textbooks, dad literally handed me a McDonald's application and said earn it yourself. When she decided violin wasn't for her and wanted to switch to dance, they enrolled her in the most expensive studio in town, paying 400 dollar monthly without blinking. Last month was the absolute final straw. Emma announced she's switching from dance to pottery because she found her true artistic calling. My parents immediately offered to fund a three thousand dollar pottery wheel, Kiln and complete studio setup. Mom was so excited she started researching pottery classes that same night. Already be planning Emma's artistic future. Meanwhile, I've been living off ramen noodles and sleeping on a mattress on the floor because they told me at 26 I should figure out my own finances and stop being a burden. On the family, when I asked for a small loan to help with a security deposit on a better apartment, dad gave me a 45 minute lecture about fiscal responsibility. The irony. While they were treating me like a complete financial liability, I been quietly crushing it at work. Three months ago, I closed the biggest software integration deal in our company's entire history. A Fortune 500 client signed a three year contract worth two point eight million dollars. And my commission structure meant serious money was finally coming my way. That's when I got my quarterly commission check. $47,000 after taxes from that one deal alone. Plus my regular salary and performance bonuses. Instead of being smart and investing it responsibly, I decided to make a statement that would complete we shatter their perception of my life. I walked straight into the Mercedes dealership that afternoon. The AMG C 63 S was sitting in the showroom like automotive perfection. Matte black paint, twin turbo V8 engine. Four 69 horsepower of pure German engineering. The kind of car that makes people stop mid conversation and just stare in amazement. The salesman initially treated me like I was completely wasting his time. Young guy in jeans and a hoodie looking at a 94 thousand dollar car. He barely made eye contact. That changed real quick when I said I wanted to put $30,000 down in cash and finance the rest. Suddenly I was his favorite customer. But here's the absolute genius Part I didn't tell anyone about the car or the commission. I just went about my normal routine for an entire week. And my parents continue their narrative about their struggling oldest son who couldn't get his life together. Then last Friday night, I posted one casual Instagram story. Nothing fancy, just a photo of my hand on the steering wheel with that iconic like three pointed Mercedes star clearly visible in the corner. The caption was simple new ride. My phone absolutely exploded within an hour. First it was Emma who screenshot the story and sent it with confused question marks. Then my mom called twice, but I let both calls go straight to voicemail. Finally dad called with a completely different tone. His voice was serious, almost suspicious.

My brother was born when doctors said my mom couldn't have more kids. They called him their miracle baby. I was 7 and suddenly invisible. For my 10th birthday, I asked to go to Dave and Buster's. They took my brother shopping for school clothes instead. Your birthday can wait, mom said. It never got rescheduled. By high school, the pattern was set. He'd break something, blame me, and I'd get grounded. He failed every class, but got a BMW for his 18th birthday. I was valedictorian and got a card. They skipped my graduation because he felt left out and needed a beach day. I stayed home during college to save money, working two jobs while finishing my degree. Every morning, my brother would jingle his BMW keys at me. Still taking the bus. Loser. After six months of overtime shifts, I finally had enough for a down payment. My friend's dad owned a used car dealership and cut me a deal on a blue Dodge Challenger. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. First thing I'd ever owned that my parents hadn't touched. I parked it in the driveway that night, put the keys on my dresser, and took about 50 photos. Even posted one on Instagram with the caption earned, not given. Next morning, the keys were gone. So was the car. So was my brother. He probably just borrowed it, mom said, not looking up from making His favorite breakfast. You know how boys are. He stole my car. Family doesn't steal from family. Three hours later, I heard the end. My brother pulled up in my challenger, except the front bumper was dragging, the passenger mirror was gone, and there was a crack spider webbing across the windshield. He tossed me the keys. Car is junk, bro. Fell apart on the highway. You should get your money back. I stared at the damage. You crashed it. Prove it. My parents immediately sided with him. Dad actually said I should apologize for accusing him of lying. Mom suggested I let my brother borrow it whenever, since he's used to nicer cars and did you a favor by testing it. I walked inside, pulled up my phone, and called 9 1 1. I'd like to report a stolen vehicle that's just been returned damaged. My mother lunged for my phone. What are you doing? Exactly what you do if a stranger stole and crashed your car. Cops arrived in 20 minutes. My brother was smirking until I pulled up the dash cam footage I'd uploaded to the cloud. See, I'd installed cameras the day I bought it, not because I'm psychic, but because I park it in a neighborhood where cars get broken into. The footage showed everything. Him hot wiring it at three a m, drag racing down the interstate, T boning a stop sign, laughing as he surveyed the damage, even calling his friend to brag About teaching me a lesson. The officers watched 30 seconds before cuffing him. This is grand theft auto and reckless endangerment. One said. The damage alone makes it a felony. My parents went nuclear. Mom screaming about family loyalty, dad threatening to kick me out. My brother just staring at me like he couldn't comprehend consequences existed. He's your brother, mom sobbed. Then he should have acted like it. The best part came during the trial. My brother's lawyer tried arguing it was a family dispute. Then the prosecutor played the dash cam audio where my brother said, I hope this teaches him. He'll

My Grandma Eloise was basically the queen of card games and causing trouble. At 91, she'd already buried three husbands, raised five kids, and spoiled 12 grandchildren rotten. When the doctors told us she had pancreatic cancer, we all knew what was coming. But nobody expected what she was planning. Two weeks before she died, Eloise called her lawyer, her doctor, and this magician guy she'd met at the casino. She told everyone she wanted her wake at her house, not some boring funeral home. Just one last game night with the family. We thought it was sweet. Like, of course grandma wants to go out playing cards. The day of the wake, we all showed up expecting the usual sad stuff. But when we walked in, there were these white envelopes taped everywhere with people's names on them. My cousin Jake got his first and opened it up. Inside was this riddle that said something like, where grandma hides her emergency chocolate stash. He had to go dig around in her bedroom closet. Everyone started opening their envelopes. My Aunt Linda got sent to the basement. Pete had to check under the garden gnome outside. My mom's riddle LED her to the attic, where she found this old photo album we'd never seen before. Each person found something personal. Grandma had been saving little treasures for years just for this moment. It was actually pretty amazing. People were laughing. And crying at the same time. Finding old letters and candy she'd hidden away. The whole house turned into this treasure hunt. And for a minute, we almost forgot why we were there. But then there was Rick, my sister's husband. This guy had been nothing but nasty to grandma for years. Always talking about how she was taking up space, how we should put her in a home. During Thanksgiving last year, he literally called her a drain on the family right to her face while she was carving the Turkey. Rick's envelope wasn't like everyone else's. When he opened it, his face went totally white. All it said was, look behind your mask, Rick. Inside was a thick stack of paper. First printed emails. Like, dozens of them. Turns out grandma had been saving every single email Rick sent to real estate agents about selling her house while she was still alive. The guy was literally trying to make deals behind our backs. But wait, it gets worse. At the bottom of the stack was a transcript of a voicemail. Rick had left this message for some agent offering him a quick under the table deal if he could get the house before the old bat croaks. Those were his actual words. My dad grabbed the papers and started reading them out loud. The whole room went dead silent except for Dad's voice reading Rick's emails about how he could finally get rid of the burden and cash In on prime real estate. Rick tried to snatch the papers away, but my Uncle Pete blocked him. Let him finish reading. Pete said his voice was ice cold. The worst part was this one email where Rick told the agent he was just waiting for nature to take its course, and then he'd have full access to liquidate asset.

Mom chose her boyfriend Rufus, over me when I was 16. He claimed I stole his Rolex, which was ridiculous since he'd pawned it weeks earlier for casino money. Rufus gave mom an ultimatum that night. Either she goes or I go. Mom didn't even hesitate. She packed my clothes and trash bags while I was at school and changed the locks. When I got home, my stuff was on the lawn getting soaked by sprinklers. I spent three weeks sleeping in a 24 hour laundromat. The owner eventually caught me, but instead of kicking me out, he offered me a job cleaning his other properties. That's how I met Mister Thief, a 73 year old man who was more powerful than I could have thought. His daughter had died at 17 in a car accident years earlier. When he found me scrubbing his toilets at 2:00am for grocery money, something in his eyes changed. Within a month, he moved me into one of his vacant luxury condos. Not some rundown unit, but a penthouse he usually rented for $5,000 a month. Mr. Thies brought me dinner every night, helped with homework, and taught me the property business. When other kids were learning to parallel park, I was learning to negotiate lease agreements and manage construction crews. He paid for my prom dress, my college tuition, even walked me down the aisle at my wedding. For five years, he was the father I never had. When he died of a heart attack, he left me everything. 47 rental properties worth $18 million. I was 21 and suddenly one of the largest property owners in the city. I tried reaching out to mom once during those years. Invited her to my high school graduation. She never showed. Drove by the house one Christmas Eve and saw her through the window laughing with Rufus. I knocked for 10 minutes. She looked right at me through the glass and closed the curtain. Mom's sister called me when I was 25. Said mom and Rufus were begging family members for money again, asking if I had anything to spare. They hit up everyone. Cousins, co workers, even Rufus's ex wife. I hung up and never asked about them again. Then yesterday, mom showed up at my office. No call, no warning. Just walked past my secretary with Rufus trailing behind. They look terrible. Mom had aged 20 years and 12, and Rufus's gut hung over his belt like he drunk two cases of beer. They stood in my office doorway, and I knew immediately this wasn't about making amends. They were getting evicted at the end of the month and needed a place to live. Mom demanded I give them one of my properties her sister told her about. Rent free, obviously because children don't abandon their parents. The same woman who threw me out like trash was lecturing me. About abandonment. She even wanted her name on several deeds for tax purposes. When I said I'd think about it, she appeared at my office building every morning with a sign saying, my daughter owns 47 properties, but lets me be homeless. Security dragged them out, but not before she yelled at the top of her lungs that I was mentally unstable and stole Mister Theese's fortune. She even showed up at Mister Theese's grave with flowers, telling mourners he was his real daughter. The woman who abandoned her child was trying to destroy the life I built without her. After 24 hours of harassment, I'd had enough. I called my lawyer and got the paperwork I'd hoped I'd never need. Then I asked my property manager, August, to drive with me to their apartment. I needed a witness for what was about to happen. The three hour drive gave me time to think about everything Mister Feast had told me. Success is the best revenge. But sometimes you need to show people the consequences of their choices.

I've been dating Sarah for four months. When she finally invited me to her older brother's country club, my entire body went tense because without her brother's blessing, we would never get married. Just warning you, she said, fixing my belt in the parking lot. He's been my protector since our parents died. My ex and senior year pretended to be broke while draining my accounts. So now Trevor still assumes every guy is after my money. I nodded my chest tight. What they didn't know, I owned a private jet company. I'd Learned money changes how people see you, so I kept my mouth shut and dressed casually. Trevor was already at the driving range when we arrived and the way he looked me up and down made it clear he'd already written me off. He wore head to toe Ralph Lauren like he was sponsored. And his handshake was the kind meant to establish dominance. After the crushing grip, he announced my hands felt soft, like someone who'd never done real work. Then asked if I even knew how to hold a club or if Sarah would have to teach me. Like a child. After we teed off, he made sure I walked while he and Sarah took the cart. Throughout the first three holes, he kept grabbing my shoulders and repositioning them, talking to Sarah over my head about how Proper lessons cost money. I clearly didn't have. My phone buzzed constantly with calls from my operations team. I switched to D&D, but Trevor noticed. Turn that thing off, he commanded. What? Doordash needs you back online. He laughed at his own joke. At the fourth hole while Sarah was lining up her putt, Trevor pulled out his phone and started showing me photos of every successful guy who was a member there, all single, all interested in Sarah. When Sarah tried to change the subject, Trevor grabbed her hand. I understand you're settling because you're scared your ex David hurt you. So now you're dating down where it's safe. He looked straight at me. No offense, but she needs someone on her level. My jaw clenched as Trevor turned back to me, his confidence growing with each insult that went unchallenged. Look at this. What happens if someone threatens you? This gonna protect you. He grabbed my arm, squeezing my bicep. Nothing. Probably can't even open a pickle jar. My jaw clenched as Trevor turned back to me, his confidence growing with each insult that went unchallenged. You know what's funny? He circled me like a predator. There is literally the only woman who'd give you a second look and that's just because she's traumatized from our parents. He actually lifted my chin with his finger, examining my face. Things escalated when a group of women from the club walked by. Trevor literally pushed me toward them. Ladies, quick. Poll, would you date this guy? They looked uncomfortable as he continued. You can be honest with me. On a scale of one to 10, one muttered, excuse, excuse me. And they hurried away. See, he turned to Sarah. Even strangers can tell he's not husband material. Trevor, please stop, Sarah pleaded. But he was on a roll. Let's talk about your future, kids, he said. His voice getting crueler. You really want this as their father? He grabbed my wrist, holding it up. These soft hands teaching them to throw this weak voice, telling bedtime stories. He actually got in my face close enough I could smell his Cologne. First day of school, other kids asking why their dad looks like the substitute teacher, why daddy can't coach the Little League, why mommy settled. My phone rang again. Trevor answered it before I could move, putting it on speaker with a smirk. The panicked voice of my operations manager filled the air, announcing something about a CEO. Furious.

I was 19 and completely broke. Like, checking couch cushions for quarters broke. My dad had just been laid off from the factory, and my mom's cleaning job barely covered rent. I was working at this grimy diner called Polly's Off Route 47, making $7 25 an hour, plus whatever tips truckers felt like leaving. Usually wasn't much. One Tuesday night in November, this old guy came in around 11 p m. Looked homeless, honestly. Dirty flannel jacket who's held together with duct tape. Hadn't shaved in weeks. He sat at the counter and stared at the menu for like 10 minutes. Finally ordered just a black coffee, 50 cents back then. I watched him count out exact change from this worn leather pouch. All pennies and nickels. His hands were shaking from the cold. The diner was dead that night. Just him and me and the cook, who was half asleep in the back. Something about him reminded me of my grandpa before he died. Same tired eyes, same way of folding his hands around a warm cup. I grabbed a plate and loaded it with eggs, bacon, toast, hash Browns. Basically everything we were about to throw out anyway. Set it in front of him. I didn't order this, he said, real quiet. Kitchen mistake. I lied. Got a toss it otherwise. He looked at me for a long moment, then his eyes got watery. And he just nodded, ate every single bite like it was his last meal. When he left, he pushed a crumpled dollar Bill across the counter. I tried to give it back, but he. It was already out the door. The dollar had something written on it in blue Pen. Angels Walk Among Us, Roy. I shoved it in my apron and forgot about it. Fast forward 11 years. I'm 30 now, working as a dental hygienist. The city, good job, decent apartment. Finally got my life together. My boyfriend Damon had just proposed the week before, and we were looking at houses. We fell in love with this place in Riverside Heights. Way out of our budget, but perfect. 3 bedrooms, big yard, original hardwood floors. The seller was some investment company called Bauer Holdings. We. They offered asking price even though it meant emptying our savings and taking on a huge mortgage. Two days later, our realtor called. You're not going to believe this. She said they rejected three higher offers and accepted yours. No conditions. They want to close next week. I thought it was a scam. Who takes a lower offer? But everything checked out. We signed papers at this fancy law office downtown. The whole thing felt surreal. Closing day, the lawyer handed me an envelope along with the keys. The seller requested you receive this personally, she said inside was a handwritten note on expensive stationery. Miss Rivera, you probably don't remember me. November 2013. Polly's Diner, Route 47. I was at the lowest point of my life that night. My wife had died, lost my job. Been living in my car for two months. Was planning to end it all after that coffee. Then you gave me that plate of food. Not because you had to. Not because I asked. Just because you saw someone hurting. That small kindness changed everything. Made me realize people still cared. I got help, got sober, started over. Built my company from nothing. Bauer Holdings. Owns 200 properties now. This house was my first purchase. Fixed it up myself. When I saw your name on the offer. I

My 14 year old son thinks he's a master of deception, but he has no idea I know about his secret YouTube channel. I discovered it by accident when I was cleaning his room and found a crumpled receipt for a 300 dollar microphone. First I was furious. We just had a talk about responsible spending. But before confronting him, I decided to do some digging. That night after he went to bed, I searched his browser history. There it was, a gaming channel with 50,000 subscribers. My quiet, introverted son who barely I spoke at family dinners was absolutely electric on camera, cracking jokes and entertaining thousands. Instead of shutting it down, I decided to play dumb and secretly support him. Every time he went to study at the library, I knew he was actually recording videos in our basement. I'd intentionally make extra noise upstairs so he'd have to re record, teaching him patience. He complained about background noise ruining his takes. I suggested soundproofing his room for better concentration while studying. He started asking for odd things, green poster board, ring lights, a better webcam. Each time I'd make him present a detailed plan for how these school supplies would improve his grades. His presentations got increasingly elaborate. He even made a Powerpoint about how better lighting would help him read text books more clearly. The best part, every time he uploaded a new video, I'd watch It immediately my son would sit at dinner casually mentioning how hard his homework was. Well, I knew he just spent 3 hours trying to beat the final boss in Elden Ring. He got creative with his excuses. Once he told us he needed to join the debate club to improve his public speaking. In reality, he was practicing his commentary skills. When he won most improved speaker at school, I had to bite my tongue. His hundreds of hours of gaming commentary had given him more confidence than any debate club could. One day he mentioned needing a new chair because his back hurt from studying. I knew the real reason. He just hit 100,000 subscribers and was streaming longer. I bought him a gaming chair but labeled it an ergonomic study chair to maintain the charade. The turning point came when I overheard him on the phone with his friend. I feel bad lying to my parents, he said, but they'd never understand. Dad would probably just lecture me about wasting time on games that hit hard. Here was my son building something impressive. Afraid I wouldn't understand. So I devised a plan. I created an anonymous account and became his biggest supporter. Always first to comment on videos. I'd leave detailed feedback just like I wished I could do in person. He started mentioning this.

Where did you get the money? Family meeting tomorrow, six PM. They had no idea what was coming. I'm Marcus, 26, and I've been the invisible son for years. While my parents throw Celebration parties every time my younger sister Emma gets a participation trophy in her dance classes. I quietly became the youngest regional sales director at a tech startup, making serious money. The favoritism has been absolutely insane my entire life. When Emma wanted to try violin at fifteen, they bought her a two thousand dollar instrument without hesitation. When I asked for help with college textbook, dad literally handed me a McDonald's application and said earn it yourself. When she decided violin wasn't for her and wanted to switch to dance, they enrolled her in the most expensive studio in town, paying 400 dollar monthly without blinking. Last month was the absolute final straw. Emma announced she's switching from dance to pottery because she found her true artistic calling. My parents immediately offered to fund a three thousand dollar pottery wheel, Kiln and complete studio setup. Mom was so excited she started researching pottery classes that same night, already planning Emma's artistic future. Meanwhile, I've been living off ramen noodles and sleeping on a mattress on the floor because they told me at 26 I should figure out my own finances and stop being a burden on the Family. When I asked for a small loan to help with a security deposit on a better apartment, dad gave me a 45 minute lecture about fiscal responsibility. The irony. While they were treating me like a complete financial liability, I been quietly crushing it at work. Three months ago, I closed the biggest software integration deal in our company's entire history. A Fortune 500 client signed a three year contract worth $2.8 million, and my commission structure meant serious money was finally coming my way. That's when I got my quarterly commission check. $7,000 after taxes from that one deal alone. Plus my regular salary and performance bonuses. Instead of being smart and investing it responsibly, I decided to make a statement that would completely shatter their perception of my life. I walked straight into the Mercedes dealership that afternoon. The AMG C 63 S was sitting in the showroom like automotive perfection. Action. Matte black paint, twin turbo V8 engine. Four 69 horsepower of pure German engineering. The kind of car that makes people stop mid conversation and just stare in amazement. The salesman initially treated me like I was completely wasting his time. Young guy in jeans and a hoodie looking at a 94 thousand dollar car. He barely made eye contact. That changed real quick when I said I wanted to put $30,000 down in cash and finance the rest. Suddenly I was his favorite customer. But here's the absolute genius part. I didn't tell anyone about The car or the commission? I just went about my normal routine for an entire week, letting my parents continue their narrative about their struggling oldest son who couldn't get his life together. Then last Friday night, I posted one casual Instagram story. Nothing fancy, just a photo of my hand on the steering wheel with that I tonic three pointed Mercedes star clearly visible in the corner. The caption was simple new ride. My phone absolutely exploded within an hour. First it was Emma, who screenshot the story and sent it with confused question marks. Then my mom called twice, but I let both calls go straight to voicemail. Finally, dad called with a completely different tone. His voice was serious, almost suspicious. Mark.

So my little brother Jake is 13 and basically a genius. Like he's already taking college classes and gets interviewed by newspapers about his research stuff. Everyone always talks about how amazing and smart he is, and honestly, our parents have never said no to him about anything his entire life. The problem is he's turned into this massive jerk who thinks he's better than literally everyone. He talks down to people constantly and acts like everyone around him is stupid. It's gotten so bad that I cringe whenever he opens his mouth around other people. Lately he's been obsessed with this girl from one of his advanced classes named Emma. He talks about her constantly but keeps complaining that she won't give him the time of day. Every single day it's the same thing. He'll come home whining about how she ignored him or didn't laugh at his jokes or whatever. Last week he invited her over to work on some project together. I was in the kitchen making a sandwich when they sat down at our dining room table. What I heard made me want to crawl under a rock from secondhand embarrassment. The entire time Jake just talked over her. she'd start to explain an idea and he'd immediately interrupt with actually, that's wrong because or that won't work, here's what we should do instead. At one point She suggested researching something online, and he literally called her idea stupid to her face. Then he spent like 20 minutes just bragging about himself. He told her about every newspaper article he'd been in, every award he'd won, every smart thing he'd ever done. The poor girl just sat there, nodding politely while looking like she wanted to disappear. The worst part was when he asked about her career plans, she said she wanted to be a teacher, and he immediately started lecturing her about how teaching doesn't pay well and she'd be wasting her potential. You could see her face just shut down completely after she left. That day, Jake came into my room all confused about why she seemed weird and distant. I wanted to tell him right then, but I figured maybe he'd figure it out on his own. He didn't. Instead, it got worse. He started coming up with all these theories about why Emma didn't like him. First he decided she was jealous of his intelligence. Then he convinced himself she was playing hard to get. Last week he told me she probably only likes dumb jock guy because girls don't appreciate smart men. Today was the final straw. Jake was at the dinner table going on his usual rant about Emma, while our parents nodded along sympathetically. He said she was obviously intimidated by how accomplished he is and that most women are too emotional to handle dating someone smarter than them. Our Mom actually agreed with him. She started talking about how some people feel threatened by exceptional individuals and that Emma probably feels insecure around Jake's success. Dad chimed in saying Jake shouldn't change himself for anyone and that the right girl would appreciate his gifts. I couldn't take it anymore. I put down my fork and looked Jake straight in the eye. She doesn't dislike you because you're smart, I said. She dislikes you because you act like a condescending jerk who thinks everyone else is stupid. The whole table went silent. Jake's mouth actually fell open. You talked over her the entire time she was here, I continued. You called her ideas stupid, you bragged about yourself non stop, and you told her she was making bad life choices. Why would anyone want to be around that? Jake started getting defensive.

Your job is in the kitchen, he added. But it wasn't fair. Every Saturday, he'd take my brothers out to the garage to work on cars while I was told to help mom inside. They'd come back covered in grease, laughing about carburetors and talking about R P M S. When I asked to join, dad would pat my head. This is boy stuff, sweetheart. You'll have a husband to handle this. I tried to tell him it was unfair and beg him constantly to teach me, but he refused. Women get too emotional behind the wheel. Trust me, it's safer this way. My best friend, Gloria, couldn't stand the way I was treated. My aunt Jenna literally owns a mechanic shop downtown, and she agrees. Your papa's a little loco, but if you really wanna learn, hey, she's down to teach you herself. I hugged Gloria. Oh, my god, you're the best! We went to her store, and I was instantly blown away by her. Aunt Jenna was everything my dad thought women couldn't be. Grease under her nails, but still rocking the makeup and beautiful curly hair. Your father thinks women are helpless. I'll teach you everything. More than he knows. She smiled with a wink. And so every Saturday, while my parents thought I was at dance class, Jenna taught me in the lot behind her shop. Not just Driving but everything. How to diagnose engine problems by sound. How to change oil, rotate tires, break fluid. Emergency maneuvers. Your brothers might know how to drive, she'd say, but can they tell you why an engine's misfiring just by listening? After a few months, I managed to finally snag my very own driver's license, something I didn't really expect my dad to find out so soon. It all went down in the middle of the highway on the way to my brother's graduation ceremony. Some hot shot in a red sports car cut off an 18 Wheeler without using a turn. The truck driver slammed his brakes, jackknifed hard. The trailer clipped the minivan next to us straight into the barrier, then sideswiped us into a spin. My brothers and mom screamed in a panic. We stopped sideways across two lanes, cars flying past, going 70 just inches from our bumper. Dad sat there frozen, hands shaking, his mind completely shutting down. I unbuckled and shot forward from the back seat. Move! I yelled. He pulled his seat back and jumped into the back row. I got into the driver's seat and restarted the stop. Old engine carefully driving us to the shoulder just as another wave of traffic came around the curve. My family hopped out of the car, crying and throwing up on the curb. The truck driver got out to check on us while calling 9 1 1. Help, please! The woman driving the mini van Screamed. We all rushed over to her, grabbing the two kids in the back first. But when the truck driver tried to reach for the mom, he couldn't get the door to move. She was trapped. The van crushed against the barrier on the only side we could reach her. While we sat there thinking about how to get her out, I smelled it. That sweet, haunting smell Jenna taught me. Brake fluid mixing with oil on hot metal. Highly explosive. Step back! I yelled to everyone. Dad started to say we should wait for the professionals, but we didn't have time. I grabbed the truck's tire iron, disconnected the lower hinge first. I called out to the truck driver to support the door while I popped the upper pins. My brothers just stood there, frozen like. Dad, get the Jack on our trunk! Now! I kicked it in position exactly where Jenna taught me, under the dashboard's frame, the strongest point, and cranked it just enough to free the woman's.

You can figure it out. She shrugged. I stood there watching her walk away with her perfect little blended family, dragging their matching designer suitcases toward the gate. She didn't even look back, not once. I had $23 in my pocket, a dead phone charger and absolutely nowhere to go in this massive airport. That's when I remembered the business card tucked in my wallet, the one with the fancy logo I've been carrying around for three years. My Aunt Sarah's restaurant card. The sister my mom had been bad mouthing my entire life, calling her a jealous failure. Sarah's a pathetic loser. Mom always said she's jealous of our success and stability. Don't believe anything she tells you about our family. But standing there alone in JFK Terminal 4, watching families rush past me with their vacation excitement, I figured I had nothing left to lose. I found a payphone. Yes, they still exist in airports, and dialed the number with shaking fingers. It rang twice before a warm, professional voice answered. Bella Vista Restaurant. This is Sarah speaking. And Sarah, it's Maya. I'm. I'm in really big trouble right now. The silence lasted forever. Then in a completely different tone. Baby girl, Maya, where are you? Are you safe? What happened? I started crying right there in the middle of the busy Terminal. Mom left me at the airport. She took her new husband and his kids on vacation to Hawaii and just abandoned me here. What terminal are you at? I'm coming to get you right now. You don't understand. I'm at JFK in New York. You're all the way in Chicago. I can't ask you to Maya. Honey, listen to me carefully. I have three successful restaurants now. I'm not the broke failure your mother told you I was. Say exactly where you are. I'm getting on the next available flight. Four hours later, I watched a confident woman in designer jeans and a cashmere coat rush through the arrivals gate, scanning the crowd frantically. She looked exactly like mom, but her eyes were kind instead of cold. When she spotted me, she started running. I've been waiting 10 years for the phone call, she whispered, hugging me so tight I could barely breathe. I've tried reaching you so many times, but your mother blocked every single attempt. To ride to her luxury hotel suite was completely surreal. Sarah explained everything while ordering room service, how she built a successful restaurant empire from nothing, how she been sending birthday cards and Christmas gifts that mom apparently threw away unopened, how she'd even hired a family lawyer once to try for visitation rights. Your mother told everyone in our family that I was a drug addict who couldn't hold a job. Sarah laughed bitterly. Meanwhile, I've been featured in Chicago magazine as Entrepreneur of the year, two years running. That night in the hotel, Sarah showed me years worth of returned letters with refused photos of elaborate birthday cake she'd made for me each year and bank statements proving she'd been setting aside money for my college fund since I was born. I'm not letting you go back to that toxic woman, she said firmly. We're calling my lawyer first thing tomorrow morning. The emergency custody hearing was swift and decisive when the family.

The grocery store security footage showed my face hitting the floor. Blood pooled around my head where I cracked it on the tile. When I woke up in the hospital, I immediately threw up blood. You're literally starving to death, the doctor told me. I try to sit up, but the room spun violently. I need to get back to work. Rent is due tomorrow. She pushed me back down. You're 16 years old and you weigh 80 pounds. That can't be right. When did you last eat a meal? Three days ago, I think. She looked horrified. Where are your parents right now? In the basement, playing their online game, like always. They don't know you're dying. They told me not to bother them unless someone is dead. You almost were dead. Almost doesn't count according to them. She glanced at my chart. You work two jobs and go to school. I work at four in the morning delivering newspapers. Then I go to school, then I work at the grocery store until midnight. That's physically impossible. Red Bull and gas station pills make it possible. You're taking stimulants. I have to pay rent or we get evicted. Your parents don't have jobs? They quit two years ago to become professional gamers. Are they making money from gaming? I laughed. They've made exactly zero dollars. But they keep saying fame is coming any day now. How much sleep are You getting? My thoughts kept slipping away like water through my fingers. Three hours on a good night, but usually less. Do you ever feel dizzy or confused? Every single day. But I can push through it. She stared at me in disbelief. Your parents make you work while they stay home gaming all day? They're trying to build their streaming career. They need my support. She examined my arms, which looked like twigs. 40 pounds underweight because you're feeding them instead of yourself. You don't understand. They should be able to follow their dreams after the sacrifices they made for me. My manager, Jimmy, had been sitting in the corner listening. He finally spoke up, looking sick with guilt. I should have said something sooner. This kid has been falling apart for months. He has been seeing things at work that aren't real. The doctor turned to him quickly. What kind of things? Yesterday he was having full conversations with nobody for 20 minutes straight. I felt my face get hot. Sometimes when I'm really tired, I see shadows that aren't there. That's your brain literally shutting down from exhaustion. Jimmy looked broken. And last week I found him unconscious in the freezer. He had been in there for 40 minutes and had blue lips. I was just resting. My eyes have died, but I didn't, so it's fine. The doctor checked my blood work again. Your body is failing and you're still defending them? They're my parents. I Owe them everything. You don't owe them your life. Without me, they'll be homeless. Without them, you'd be healthy. The doctor called Child Protective Services and a social worker arrived within an hour. They tried calling my parents 23 times before anyone answered. The doctor put them on speaker so the social worker could record everything. I could hear battle sounds and screaming from their game in the background. This better be important because you just made us lose a ranked match. The doctor spoke calmly. This is the hospital calling about your son who collapsed at work. What does that lazy piece of garbage want now? He's in critical condition from severe malnutrition. My dad exploded. Of course. I should have just let him die when he was born instead of wasting 16

Everyone called me the calculator. Not because I loved math, though I was good at it, but because I could tell you exactly what score you needed on any assignment to keep your GPA alive. By senior year, I was basically running an underground academic consulting service from the library during lunch. It's started innocently. Sophomore year, Raj was failing chemistry and needed exactly 73% on the final to pass. I mapped out what to study, which problems to focus on, even which partial credit opportunities to exploit. He passed with a 74%. Word spread quietly. By junior year, kids would slip me their grade reports during passing periods, and I'd create personalized survival strategies. Never charged money, just traded for small favors, leftover cafeteria cookies, rides home when it rained, notes from classes I missed. I genuinely enjoyed it at first, watching kids faces light up when they realized they could still pass, still graduate, still make their parents proud. It felt like I was doing something meaningful. Then came senior year, and everything changed. Ashley was fighting for valedictorian, ranked first, while I sat comfortably at third. She came to me crying, mascara streaming, saying her parents would literally disown her if she lost the top spot. Her weakness was AP literature. I spent three weeks tutoring her, editing her essays until they sang, creating study guides that mapped every possible essay question. She went from a B+ To an A. But success made her entitled. She'd text at 2:00am, demanding I review her work immediately. When I said I needed sleep for my own exams, she'd remind me how she'd helped me get into National Honor Society, conveniently forgetting I qualified on merit alone. Other kids were the same. They ignored me in hallways, forgot my name at lunch, never invited me to parties. But suddenly, mysteriously, they all knew exactly where to find me when grades were due. The breaking point was Trevor, our star quarterback. He needed to maintain a 2.5 GPA for his football scholarship, but hadn't turned in a single assignment all semester. Instead of asking for help, he cornered me after school, pushed me against the lockers hard enough to bruise. You're going to do my makeup work, he said, not asking. When I refused, he smiled coldly. Then I'll tell Rodriguez you're selling answers. Who do you think she'll believe, the quarterback or the weird kid who's always in the library? He reported me. The next day. I sat in Principal Rodriguez's office, stunned as she lectured me about academic pretty while Trevor smirked from across the room. She couldn't prove anything, but the threat was clear. Stop helping people or face suspension that would destroy my college applications. That night, I realized the truth. I wasn't a friend or even a person to them. I was a tool, a calculator they could use and discard. The same kids who whispered Nerd, when I walked past, who made fun of my secondhand clothes, suddenly needed me desperately. The night before finals week, my phone exploded. 43 messages in two hours. Ashley had given my number to half the senior class. Emergency. Need help now, please. I'll fail just this once, I swear. I stared at the messages, feeling something inside me finally cracked. I opened my laptop and started typing. But instead of real study guides, I created something else. For each person who'd messaged me, I calculated precisely

My mother ambushed me during a board meeting. If you don't bring someone to our anniversary gala, I'm calling Missus Mendez about her daughter. She's very interested in meeting you. 12 board members suddenly found their phones fascinating, while their 35 year old CEO got threatened with an arranged marriage. After dismissing everyone, I walked past the break room and heard muffled crying from the bathroom. Through the door, I could make out Selena's voice. I understand, mom. I'll figure out the payment somehow. Just tell them we need two more weeks. Selena emerged with red eyes. She tried to hide behind her glasses. She'd been my assistant for two years. Never late, never complaining, always staying past eight with being asked. Everything all right? I asked, though we both knew I'd heard. She straightened her blazer and forced her professional smile. Of course, Mister Pierce. Did you need the quarterly reports? That's when I had the idea. Actually, I have a proposition, I said, watching her reaction. $50,000 for three months of work, evenings and weekends. Her eyes widened, but he stayed composed. What kind of work? Being my girlfriend. Fake girlfriend, I clarified. Contract basis, strict boundaries. We attend events together, hold hands in public, convince my parents I'm in a relationship. Three months until their anniversary passes. She stared at me for a full minute. You're serious? Completely. You need money for your Mother's medical Bill. I need my parents off my back. Simple transaction. Within a week, we had a 12 page contract. No feelings, no private touching. Three dates weekly. Public affection only when necessary. She slid the papers across. I added a termination clause. Either party can exit with 24 hours notice. I nodded. Remember, we've been dating three months. You call me sweetheart sometimes. We met when I started working here, but kept it professional until recently. Her voice was clinical, like reading a spreadsheet. The first month was flawless. Selena transformed into the perfect girlfriend at charity galas and family dinners. Ready, darling? She'd say with a bright smile that never quite reached her eyes. She researched my colleagues wives, laughed at my father's golf stories, charmed my mother completely. In private, we maintained exact professional distance. She'd brief me like we were preparing for a merger. I should touch your shoulder when you mention the Tokyo deal, she'd say. Review notes, show support. We memorize things about each other. Your favorite color is blue. You're allergic to shellfish. We met at a charity auction. For two months, we were like the world's most professional actors. We had eight weeks left. Everything was perfectly on track. Then came the storm. Thunder crashed through my penthouse at midnight. Rain hammering the windows. The sound mixed with rumbling. And suddenly I was 15 again. Trapped in our car as it hydroplane. My brother screaming, metal crunching. Then silence. The panic. Attack hit like a freight train. My chest locked, vision tunneling, legs buckle. I collapsed beside my bed, gasping for air that wouldn't come through the roaring in my ears. I heard my door opening. Selena's voice called out, Mister Pierce, you left these contracts. I thought you need them for tomorrow. She found me on the floor, shaking, drenched in sweat. Without hesitation, she dropped everything and knelt beside me. Look at me. Breathe with me. In for four. Hold out for four. Her hands gripped mine. You're safe. You're in your apartment. She pulled me against her fingers running through my hair, completely shattering our professional boundary. She stayed all night, talking me through each wave. Stories about her childhood, her college disasters, her mother's cooking. When the shaking stopped around four

Everyone stared. I stood up and said, then stop calling me when you need money. Her face fell and everyone stopped breathing. I'm Linda, 32, the invisible middle child. My older brother Michael is the golden boy doctor. My younger sister Karen is the precious princess lawyer. I'm stuck in the middle, desperately trying to earn a fraction of their attention. Growing up, I worked twice as hard for half the recognition. Michael got praised for b's while I needed straight A's just to get acknowledgement. When Karen threw tantrums, it was cute. When I raised my voice, I was disrespectful. When I chose marketing as my college major, my mother's face fell. Marketing isn't a real career, Linda. That's just playing with pretty pictures. Why can't you be more like Michael and choose something that actually helps people? But what my family didn't know was that I've been their secret financial lifeline. For two years, I've been sending mom $1,500 monthly for car payments when Dad's business struggled. When dad needed surgery, I covered $3,000 in medical costs. When Michael's student loans defaulted, I paid $4,000 my house down payment savings. When Karen needed $2,000 for bar exam fees after blowing her trust fund on Europe, guess who covered it every time? Mom made me promise not to tell anyone. It would embarrass them, she said. Meanwhile, at every family gathering, she dismissed my career and compare me unfavorably to My siblings real accomplishments. This past Christmas, I finally had amazing news to share. David had proposed in October. The ring was perfect. And more importantly, he saw me in a way my family never had. I'd also just been promoted to senior marketing coordinator with a significant raise. For the first time in my adult life, I felt genuinely proud of what I'd accomplished. Christmas dinner started normally. I announced my engagement, showing my beautiful ring to polite congratulations and forced smiles. When Karen asked what David did and I said he was a high school English teacher, my mother repeated, a teacher, like I'd said, unemployed, vagrant. Then came the moment that changed everything. You know, Linda, my mother said, looking directly at me, I've been thinking about this engagement of yours and I have to be honest, I'm worried about David. I mean, what kind of man proposes to you? The table went silent. What do you mean, I asked. So I was afraid. I already knew. Well, let's be realistic here. You're 32. You work in a job that barely pays the bills. You live in that tiny apartment and you've never really accomplished anything significant. The most useless child we have. I just hope David realizes what he's signing up for before it's too late. The silence was deafening. Everyone stared at me, waiting to see how I'd react. For the first time in my life, instead of shrinking back, I felt 32 years of Suppressed frustration finally finding its voice. I stood up slowly and looked my mother directly in the eyes. Then stop calling me when you need money. Her face fell as I pulled out my phone and opened my banking app. I'm talking about the 25th hundred dollars I've been sending you every month for two years to cover your car payments because Dad's business was struggling. I'm talking about the $3,000 I gave you for Dad's surgery when insurance wouldn't cover the costs. I'm talking about the $2,000 I sent for Karen's bar exam fees because she'd spent her trust fund on Europe. I started reading actual transactions. September 15th, 2022, 1, $500 to Patricia Walsh for car payment. October 3rd.

He abandoned me and our two month old son eight years ago because he wasn't ready for fatherhood. I thought it would destroy me, but I figured it out alone. See, my ex wasn't just unprepared. He was cruel about leaving. Packed his things while I was at my postpartum check up. Left a note saying he made mistake. Moved in with his coworker Lena that same week. The woman he swore was just a friend. Within a month, they were posting couple photos while I was selling my jewelry to buy formula. I worked nights at the hospital as a receptionist. $12 an hour paid my elderly neighbor to watch the baby. Some weeks I chose between diapers and groceries. Food banks became my regular stops. Meanwhile, he was taking Lena on weekend trips. Posted about finding true love. Never sent a penny for his son. Leon is 8 now. Straight a student, soccer star. Polite kid who helps neighbors carry groceries. He doesn't ask about his father anymore. Stopped asking at age 5. My ex showed up maybe four times a year. Always canceled last minute. Sorry, something came up. Work thing. Lena's not feeling well. Car trouble. Leon would sit by the window waiting. I'd make excuse. Traffic emergency at daddy's work. Eventually, Leon stopped waiting by the window. I went back to school when Leon Was 3, got my degree, got a real job, made real money and bought us a small house when he was 6. Last month, my ex got married to Lena. His mom sent me photos. I thought I should see how happy he looked. Lena's pregnant. Do any day. Starting his real family. His mom said, like Leon doesn't exist. Then two weeks ago, out of nowhere, my ex shows up at my door. Not to see Leon. Leon was at soccer practice. He came to ask for something. Lena had their baby three weeks ago, and the delivery went badly. She needed an emergency C section. Now she has postpartum depression. She can't hold the baby without having panic attacks. She won't get out of bed. His mom lives in Florida, but won't come help. Lena has no parents, so he wants me to watch their baby every weekday. Nine in the morning until five at night. For three months. Maybe longer if Lena doesn't get better. You managed fine with Leon, he says. Standing at my door like he has any right to be there. You know how to handle babies. The audacity was breathtaking. This man who ran away from his own crying baby was asking me to raise his new daughter. I work. I told him. Jobs have flexible schedules. You could work nights again or take family leave. Family leave? To watch his child while his wife recovers from what I went through alone. I Tried to close the door. He blocked it with his foot. Leon should meet his sister. Ophelia needs stability. You're already experienced, Philia. He named his daughter Ophelia. The name I'd wanted if we'd had a girl. He left his number and said to think about it. Then the texts started. Daily, sometimes hourly. Pictures of the baby. Guilt trips. Lena's getting worse. The baby's not eating well. They're drowning. I'm the only one who can help. Family helps family. Don't punish Ophelia for our past. Be the bigger person. Then came uglier messages. I was better. Vindictive. Poisoning Leon against his sister. No wonder he left me. I was probably why Lena got depressed. Toxic energy, bad karma. Maybe I should look at why I'm alone. After a week of harassment, I'd had enough. I decided to drive to his house myself the next morning at 6 a m. It was a three hour drive to my ex's suburban house. The house he bought with Lena. Four bedrooms, two

The mean theater kids at my school had no idea I used to be on Broadway. After three years of performing eight shows a week, all I wanted was to be a normal 15 year old at my new school, where nobody knew I'd originated the role of Sophie in the musical everyone was obsessed with. But then I walked into the auditorium and saw the popular theater kids clustered together wearing matching drama club hoodies. Queen Bee Madison looked me up and down while I signed my name on the audition sheet. Her face scrunching up, she whispered loud enough for everyone to hear that community theater rejects always thought they could waltz into their program just because Mommy said they were special. Her minions, Britney and Jade, giggled while Madison asked if I'd gotten my audition outfit from Walmart's clearance rack, pointing at my plain jeans and sweater that apparently screamed amateur hour to anyone with real theater experience. When I said I was auditioning for Sophie, Madison actually laughed so hard she had to grab Britney's shoulder for support. She explained to everyone that Sophie required years of professional training to hit those notes, not whatever karaoke bar preparation I obviously had. Jade pulled up the Broadway cast recording on her phone and played the famous act too solo that I performed over a thousand times, asking if I Even knew this was originally sung by someone who trained at Juilliard since age 7, I bit my tongue so hard I tasted blood because that someone was literally me, and I'd actually been training since age five. and demanded I show them my audition song right there in the lobby since we all knew I wouldn't make it past the first cut anyway. When I started the opening verse, she immediately stopped me and demonstrated the correct breathing technique while the others nodded like she was teaching a master class. She grabbed my diaphragm and pushed hard, saying I needed to feel the expansion if I ever wanted to produce real sound instead of the squeaky whisper I was apparently producing. He commented that my vowel shapes were completely wrong and physically manipulated my jaw while telling me to watch her mouth form the proper positions. During the actual audition sign UPS, Madison erased my name from the Sophie List and rewrote it under ensemble, explaining that even that was generous considering I moved like I've never taken a dance class. She made me do a pirouette right there to prove I could at least spin without falling over, then shook her head sadly when I completed three perfect turns, saying my technique was shopping mall dance studio at best. Jade videoed the whole thing on her phone while providing commentary about how my arms looked like wet noodles and my spot was non existent. Sabotage started when I went to change into my audition dress in the bathroom. Madison followed me in and accidentally spilled her entire iced coffee down my front while gasping that she was so sorry, but maybe it was a sign from the theater gods that I should reconsider. While I was cleaning myself off, Britney took my sheet music from my bag and crumpled each page into a ball before smoothing them out again, making them barely readable. She sweetly offered to let me borrow her marked up copy, but every note was intentionally written wrong. When they called my name, Madison announced to the full auditorium that they were about to witness what happened when Disney Channel made kids think they had talent. She started a slow clap when I walked on stage, getting others to join in mockingly, while shouting that I should save everyone time and just mouth the words since we all knew I couldn't actually sing. Jade yelled from the back that her nine year old sister had played Sophie in their basement, and even she had better stage presence then whatever this was supposed to be. I started singing and Madison stood up in the front row, turning to address everyone behind her while I performed. She provided running commentary about every single thing I was doing wrong, from my posture to my projection to the way I was butchering the composer's intentions with my interpretation. When I hit the high note perfectly, she actually said Autotune must be getting really advanced. These

Now she wants her inheritance. I'm 54 and got divorced eight years ago from my wife of 20 years. The day the papers were signed, my daughter Sarah, now 28, immediately took her mom's side and blocked me on everything without even asking what actually happened. My ex was ruthless. She told Sarah I cheated, that I abandoned the family, I was emotionally abusive. None of it was true. She was the one who had the affair. But Sarah ate it up. I tried calling, texting, even showing up at her apartment. Nothing worked. Dad, I don't want to hear your lies, she said. The last time I saw her, mom told me everything. You're disgusting. Eventually, my ex threatened to get a restraining order against me for harassment, so I gave up. Those eight years were the darkest of my life. I moved to a smaller apartment, took care of my mom, who had alzheimer's and basically became a hermit. Had a few casual relationships, but couldn't trust anyone. When mom passed away three months ago, I grieved alone. No Sarah at the funeral, no one to share memories with. Just me cleaning out her house by myself. Then out of nowhere, last week, unknown number calls me. Dad, it's Sarah. I saw on Facebook that grandma passed. Are you okay? My heart nearly exploded. After eight years of silence, I thought she finally came around. Maybe losing grandma made her realize Life's too short to hold grudges. We talked for an hour. She suggested dinner at my place. I was so nervous. I cleaned the apartment three times and bought her favorite wine from when she was in college. Opening that door was surreal. She looked so different. Older. More like her mother. Dinner was awkward, but good. We caught up on her job, her fiance, small talk. Then we got to the elephant in the room. Dad, I need to apologize, he said. I realize now that mom probably exaggerated things during the divorce. I should have heard your side. For a moment, I felt hopeful. Maybe this was genuine. Then she dropped a nuke. So anyway, I was wondering about Grandma's will. I figured you'd have been contacted by now about my inheritance. But when that didn't happen, then I thought I should reach out directly. My wedding's in four months, and honestly, we could really use the money. My stomach dropped. She didn't come back because she missed me. She came back for money. Sarah, your grandma left everything to me years ago when she got diagnosed. There's no inheritance for you. Her face changed immediately. The fake warmth disappeared. What do you mean, there's no inheritance? I'm her only grandchild. I visited her all the time before she got sick. You visited her twice in eight years? Sarah, that's not the point. She loved me. She would have wanted me to have something. I offered her a Few thousand for my own avings for the wedding. Her face twisted with disgust. She stood up, started pacing around my kitchen. You know what? You're exactly the selfish a whole mom always said you were. I'm glad you're alone. You deserve it.

Everyone nodded along. I unwrapped my gift slowly and said, that's why the snowball prize nomination letter came as such a shock. The room went dead silent. My mom dropped her coffee mug on the floor. My brother Kevin stopped mid by, made of his cinnamon roll. Even my grandma looked up from her crossword puzzle. Dad just stared at me like I'd grown a second head. See, every Christmas was the same routine at our house. Dad would make his little speech about how Kevin was the successful one with his fancy marketing job and new BMW. Then he'd look at me, shake his head, and make some comment about how I was still figuring things out at 28. This year was supposed to be no different. I was sitting on the scratchy brown couch in my old pajamas, watching everyone else open expensive gifts while I got a target gift card and a lecture. Dad was in his usual spot by the fireplace, coffee in hand, ready to deliver his annual disappointment speech. But three weeks earlier, something crazy had happened. I was in my tiny lab at the university, working late on this research nobody cared about. It was this super boring stuff about plant proteins that could help fight cancer. I've been working on it for six years, staying up until three in the morning, living off ramen and energy. Drinks. My phone rang at like eleven PM. It was Doctor Peterson from the Nobel Committee. At first I thought it was a prank call. Kevin's always doing stupid stuff like that. But then she started talking about my research paper and how the committee had been following my work. She said they were nominating me for the Nobel Prize in chemistry. Me, the family screw up who still drove a beat up Honda Civic and shopped at thrift stores. I made her repeat it three times before I believed her. The official letter came two days before Christmas. I kept it hidden in my desk drawer, not sure if I should tell anyone. Part of me wanted to prove dad wrong, but another part was scared he'd find some way to make it about Kevin instead. So when dad started his usual Christmas morning routine about Kevin's accomplishments, I just listened. He went on and on about Kevin's promotion and his new apartment downtown. Then he turned to me with that disappointed look I knew so well. That's when I pulled out the letter. My hands were shaking. As I held up the official Nobel Committee letterhead, I read the first line out loud. We are pleased to inform you that you have been nominated for the Nobel Prize in chemistry for your groundbreaking research in plant based cancer treatment. Dad's face went through about five different emotions in 10 seconds. First confusion, then disbelief, then this weird mixture. Of pride and embarrassment. Kevin actually choked on his cinnamon roll and started coughing. My mom was the first to speak. She jumped up from her chair and hugged me so tight, I could barely breathe. She kept saying, I knew it. I knew you were special.

Let's see if he can make it back. They laughed and drove away. I never came back. Standing at that Colorado gas station, watching their tail lights disappear, something inside me just broke. Five years of marriage, and Chloe thought abandoning me 300 miles from home was hilarious. No phone, no wallet, nothing. The gas station clerk, an older guy named Pete, saw me standing there looking lost. You all right, son? He asked. I explained what happened, expecting him to shake his head and walk away. Instead, he handed me a bottled water and said, some people ain't worth the ground they walk on. He even let me use his phone to call the local shelter. I hitched a ride to Grand Junction with a trucker who didn't ask questions, found a homeless shelter run by a former Marine named Roy. He handed me a clipboard and said, fill this out. Tomorrow we figure out the rest. That night, lying on a cot surrounded by strangers, I stared at the ceiling, thinking about Chloe's laugh as they drove away, how Stephanie had said, he'll figure it out. He always does. Like I was some kind of trained dog they could abandoned for entertainment. Roy got me a job washing dishes at Jackie's Diner for cash. The owner, a tough old woman covered in tattoos, paid me under the table. You running from something? She Asked one day, watching me scrub plates like my life depended on it. Running to something, I said. Turns out Jackie had connections. Real estate connections. She'd been flipping houses since the 90s. Knew every contractor, inspector and banker in town. You got a good head on your shoulders, she told me after I caught an accounting error that would have cost her thousands. Wanna learn the business? Six months later, I was swinging hammers and learning to read blueprints. Becky taught me everything. How to spot a good deal, negotiate with contractors, manage cash flow. This ain't charity, she'd say. You're earning every dollar. Within two years, I owned three rental properties. Change my name legally to Marcus Stone. Felt right, felt solid. Found peace I'd never had with Chloe. No more walking on eggshells. No more being the butt of every joke at gatherings. I met Sarah at a hardware store. She was buying paint for her first apartment. Asked my advice on colors. We started dating. Slowly, carefully. When I told her my story, she just nodded and said, some chapters need to end before better ones can begin. We married three years later. Small ceremony. Just Jackie, Roy and a few close friends. Real friends who'd stick around when things got tough. Then last week, 15 years later, my phone started buzzing. Unknown No. 107 missed calls over two days. Finally answered. Mike? Oh, my God. Mike, is that you? I've been looking everywhere. Chloe's voice Desperate now? Crying. I hired a private investigator. It took months to find you. Mike, I'm so sorry. That day was the worst mistake of my life. My husband left me. I lost the house. The kids barely talk to me since the divorce. I have nothing left. Please, I need your help. Stop, I said quietly. You don't understand. I've been searching for you for years. I know you're successful now. I saw the business licenses, the properties. I know you can help me. We were married. That has to count for something. Chloe, I interrupted you

Don't walk with me. You'll embarrass me in front of my friends. I nodded and let her go ahead. But when she came back weeks later, her ride home wasn't me. Rosie and I had been together since college, but everything changed when she discovered social media fame. What started as posting cute outfit photos evolved into a full obsession with follower counts and brand partnerships. Six months ago, she quit her stable marketing job to become a full time influencer. We made a deal. I'd cover major bills for six months while she built her brand, using her savings for business expenses. Instead, her business expenses looked like shopping sprees, while she treated me like an assistant funding her lifestyle. This Europe trip was supposed to be her final push before she had to start contributing again. At the airport, I helped with her three massive suitcases. As we approached check in, she spotted her friends, Lauren and Ashley, dressed like runway models. They looked at me in my jeans and hoodie with obvious disgust. Rosie panicked. You can stop here, she whispered harshly. I'll walk you to security, I said, confused. She glanced at her smirking friends, then back at me with cold calculation. Don't walk with me, you'll embarrass me in front of my friends. In that moment, our entire relationship replayed with perfect. Every dismissive comment, every time I felt like an accessory instead of a partner. The love I felt for Her evaporated instantly. I didn't get angry. A strange calm settled over me. You're right, I said politely. I wouldn't want to do that. I let go of her luggage cart. Have a great trip. Then I walked away without looking back. She'd be gone three weeks. More than enough time. First, I sold the luxury SUV she drove entirely in my name, back to the dealership for a large check. And I hired a junk removal service to clear every trace of her from my house. Clothes, products, her entire filming studio in the spare bedroom. All gone. I changed every password on our shared accounts and removed her from my credit cards. Most importantly, I found her influencer website login and made myself the administrator by changing the recovery email to mine. I spent two weeks rebuilding my life, reconnecting with friends she'd found boring, doing things I'd stopped because they weren't Instagrammable. She sent me photos from Europe, Eiffel Tower, pasta in Rome, never asking how I was. I never replied. Days before her return, I used the car money to book a motorcycle tour through national parks. My flight left the same day she arrived. The night before, I sent one email. As per your request at the airport, I have ceased to be part of your life. Your belongings are in storage. Unit 42, first month prepaid. The car has been sold. It was my property. House locks changed. You're no longer a resident. I'll Be unreachable for weeks. Best wishes, Tom. From Zion National Park. Five days later, I turned my phone back on. To hundreds of missed calls and voicemails. My friend Dave gave me the breakdown. Rosie waited at arrivals for an hour before taking an expensive cab home with her suitcases. Her key didn't work. She was stranded on my porch with 300 pounds of luggage until her parents drove two hours to collect her. She launched a social media campaign.

When I asked why, she said, we didn't think you'd be interested since you're not the motherly type. I just smiled and said, you're right. I'll be too busy at my own shower next week. The look on Emma's face was perfect. Her mouth dropped open like she'd been slapped. See, what she didn't know was that I've been hiding my pregnancy for three months because I was scared something might go wrong again after my miscarriage last year. Emma and I used to be best friends, started trying to get pregnant around the same time two years ago. When she got pregnant immediately and I didn't, she started treating me differently. She'd make comments like, maybe you're just not ready, or, some people aren't meant to be moms yet. Whenever I mention doctor appointments or fertility tests. The worst part was when I finally got pregnant last year and lost the baby at eight weeks, Emma actually said, maybe it's for the best. You didn't seem that excited anyway. I should have cut her off then, but I was grieving and didn't have energy to fight this time. When I saw those two pink lines on the pregnancy test, I kept quiet. I only told my husband Jake, and my mom. We decided to wait until 12 weeks to tell anyone after what happened before. My doctor said everything looked good, but I was still terrified. Emma's baby shower was Last Saturday at the community center downtown. I heard about it from our mutual friend Casey, who felt awkward about the whole thing. She said Emma specifically told people not to invite me because she gets weird around baby stuff and it would be uncomfortable for everyone. When Casey told me that I was already 13 weeks pregnant and had just heard the heartbeat for the first time, I was finally starting to believe this might actually happen. That's when I decided Emma deserved a reality check. Monday morning, I called Emma and asked straight up why I wasn't invited. She gave me that not the motherly type line while sounding all fake sweet about it. That's when I dropped my bomb about my own shower. What do you mean, your own shower? She stammered. I thought you gave up trying. Nope, I said cheerfully. 14 weeks along, due in March. My mom's planning the shower for next Sunday at the country club. The silence on the phone was so long, I thought she'd hung up. Then she started backtracking hard. Oh, my god! I had no idea! Why didn't you tell me? We're supposed to be best friends! This changes everything! But here's the thing. It didn't change anything for me. Her true colors had been showing for months. The comments, the exclusion, the judgment. I realized I've been making excuses for someone who wasn't really my friend anymore. Listen, Emma, I said calmly. I didn't tell you because I've Learned to protect myself from negative energy. And honestly, after being excluded from your shower for not being motherly enough, I don't think we're as close as we used to be. She started crying and saying she'd made a mistake, that she was just stressed about her own pregnancy, but I wasn't buying it. Real friends don't treat you like damaged goods when you're struggling. The best part came two days later when Casey texted me screenshots Emma had posted in our college group chat begging people to come to a last minute get together at her house because she felt terrible about a misunderstand

Uncle Wayne was worth millions, but lived like a miser, constantly testing our family to see who was worthy of his money. Every holiday was an audition where cousins would compete for his approval like desperate contestants on a reality show. I'm leaving everything to whoever proves they don't need it. Announce at family dinners while everyone kissed his ass and hung on his every word. My cousins would bring him expensive gifts they couldn't afford, offer to clean his house for free, practically beg for his attention and validation. They'd research his interests and pretend to share his hobbies. My cousin Kyle even switched his major to business because Uncle Wayne mentioned he respected entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, I brought nothing and sat in the corner reading a book, completely disinterested in his little power games. Grace doesn't seem to care about family, he'd say loud enough for me to hear. Testing to see if I'd scramble for his approval like the others. You're right, I'd reply without looking up from my book. I don't care about your money either. Always made him pause. While my cousins were falling over themselves to prove their worth, I was actively proving my indifference. While they fought over who could drive him to appointments and grocery shop for him, I got a second job and started Saving every penny. While they argued about his will, I was building my own future. When they'd ask why I never visited Uncle Wayne, I'd say, he has plenty of volunteers. I found his manipulation disgusting. Watching grown adults debase themselves for money made me sick. I'd rather be broke with dignity than rich through desperation. My cousins thought I was crazy. Don't you want financial security? Anna would ask. I'm setting myself up without begging, I'd tell her. While they spent their weekends doing his yard work and running his errands, I was working overtime and taking online courses to improve my skills. While they were buying him birthday presents and Christmas gifts, I was investing in my education and building an emergency fund. The dynamic was fascinating to watch. The more desperate they became for his approval, the more he seemed to enjoy withholding it. The more I ignored him, the more curious he became about me. At family gatherings, he'd try to bait me into conversations about money and success. I'd give polite, brief responses and go back to whatever I was doing. I wasn't rude, but I wasn't performing for him either. Grace, what are your career plans? He'd ask in front of everyone. Working on it, I'd say simply not elaborating. This drove him crazy because he couldn't figure out my angle. Everyone else was transparent in their attempts to impress him, but I genuinely didn't seem to care about his opinion or his money. The day he died, everyone gathered for the will, reading like vultures.

My brother and I used to bet on everything. Not for money, just dumb sibling stuff. Last one to the car is a loser. First one to the couch picks the movie. Last one to the shower smells like feet, that kind of thing. But our most sacred, most legendary competition. The toilet dash. It started when we were kids, maybe 8 and 10. After a long family road trip, we both sprinted inside, racing for the bathroom like our bladders were gonna burst. He got there first, slammed the door shut behind him, and shouted, I win! I get to pick dinner! No one had even agreed on that rule, but it stuck. From then on, every time we got home from somewhere, a movie, school, a soccer, her game, we'd shout some variation of, first one to the toilet gets to pick the pizza! Last one to the toilet has to clean up dog poop. First one to the toilet gets bragging rights. We never actually enforced the rules. It wasn't about winning anything. It was about the bit. The inside joke. The sheer absurdity of sprinting full speed through the hallway, knocking into furniture, nearly tearing door. It's off hinges, just to be first to pee. Our parents hated it. Mom once yelled, you're going to break something important! Dad replied, like their bladders! We thought he was hilarious. We kept it up for years. Even As teenagers, even when we were too cool for most things, somehow this one joke always made the cut. And then it just faded. We got older, busier. He started driving. I got into music. He had a job and college occurrences to worry about. Somewhere along the way, we stopped yelling Toilet Dash! When we came home, the silence didn't feel weird at first. It just felt like growing up. But a few months ago, something changed. We were coming back from a long day helping our cousin move into her apartment. We were hot, tired, and both half dehydrated from lifting furniture and pretending we knew how to assemble IKEA beds. As we walked through the front door, I smiled and shouted instinctively. Last one to the toilet has to buy dinner. I took off running full speed, skidded into the hallway, laughing like an idiot, slammed the bathroom door behind me. No footsteps followed. I waited, expecting a bang on the door, a hey. I was closer, something. But nothing. I came out and found him standing in the living room, still holding his water bottle, not moving. I nudged him. You lose, man. Better Venmo me for that pizza. He forced to laugh. Now you can have it. Didn't think much of it at the time. Just figured he was tired, maybe he really didn't need to go. Whatever. A week later, we were at the mall. I almost did it again. Almost yelled it in The parking lot. But I stopped myself. For some reason, it didn't feel right. Then, a few days after that, I went to grab my phone charger from his room. His door was slightly open and he didn't see me walk in. He was sitting on the edge of his bed, head in his hands. His phone was on speaker. I froze when I heard the voice. A doctor, calm, measured. So we'll monitor the progression, but based on your scans, it's likely you'll experience increasing pressure around the lower spine. That may explain the numbness and the urgency symptoms you described. My stomach dropped. He mumbled something I couldn't hear. The doctor continued. I understand.

She said, I'm not ready to close doors. What if someone better comes along? I was coming upstairs with groceries and heard everything. I left the groceries and her house key on the counter. Rachel and I had been together for three years. We were 30 and 33, spending four to five nights a week together, had keys to each other's apartments, and I was planning to propose in the spring. I'd already been ring shopping, found a vintage solitaire I knew she'd love at a jeweler downtown. She was smart, funny, had her life together. I felt like I'd lucked out. What I didn't realize was how often Rachel made comments that should have been red flags. When her friend Sarah got engaged, she said, I just can't imagine settling down with the first decent guy who comes along. When we'd watch romantic movies, she'd critique the couples. She could do so much better. Or, he's nice, but where's the passion? I'd rationalize these comments as her being thoughtful about commitment, maybe even mature for taking marriage seriously. Looking back, I was willfully blind to what she was really saying. We'd even book a trip to Italy for our fourth anniversary in March. $4,000 worth of flights and hotels I'd put on my credit card because she was tight on cash that month. She promised to pay me back, but like many of her promises, it was always next paycheck. Or after my bonus. That December, we were staying at her mom Carol's house for her birthday. Rachel had forgotten ingredients for dinner, so I volunteered to drive to the store in the snow. I spent 40 minutes getting everything, plus flowers for Carol, because I genuinely cared about this family I thought would become mine. Their house has a split level entry. You come through the garage, up steps into the kitchen. The living room is right off the kitchen with no separation. I just opened the door and was halfway up when I heard Carol. So when is Matt going to propose you? You have been together forever. I paused, curious about Rachel's answer. Mom, seriously, not this again. What? You're not getting any younger. He's a good man. Stable job, treats you well. Yeah, that's great, but I'm not ready to close doors. You know? What if someone better comes along? That's a good guy, but I don't know if he's my forever guy. I froze on those steps, grocery bags suddenly feeling like they weighed a thousand pounds. Carol responded, that's a terrible way to think, Rachel. You can't keep people as backups. I'm not saying he's a backup. He's safe, dependable. But sometimes I wonder if there's more excitement out there. Like, what if I'm settling? What if there's someone who makes my heart race the way Matt used to, but doesn't anymore? I mean, he's talking about marriage, and I just freeze up. Not Because I don't love him. But because I keep thinking, is this it? Is this the best I can do? Three years I'd invested in someone who saw me as a safe option while she waited for someone better. My phone blew up 20 minutes later. Texts and calls. I texted back. Once I heard what you said to your mom, we're done. I'll get my things next week when you're at work. Then I muted her. The next morning, I had 37 missed calls and endless texts. Rachel insisting I misunderstood, that she loved me, that she was just dealing with pressure. I didn't respond. Instead, I called her sister, Jess, 27, a personal trainer I'd met at family gatherings but never really hung out with alone. Tuesday, I went to Rachel's with some buddies to collect my thing. As we were finishing, Jess showed up, offering to help. Can't say I blame you, she said about my decision. I'd have done the same thing.

I replied, fair enough. Then I transferred all the vendor contracts to her father's name. The chaos that followed was glorious. I'd saved $35,000 for our dream wedding. Everything was booked in my name since I was paying. Then Sydney's parents decided to contribute. By contribute, they meant complete. We take over. Ronald wrote a 40 thousand dollar check, and suddenly everything changed. Cancel the mansion, use their country club. Ditch our photographer for their family friend. Triple the guest list for business associates. I pushed back. This was our wedding. Sydney pulled me aside. They're paying now. It's only fair they get input. Input is one thing. They're changing everything. They are paying 40 thousand dollars. Already put $15,000 in deposits down. They said they'd reimburse me. Spoiler, they didn't. The breaking point came when Lauren called, announcing she'd canceled our Italian rehearsal dinner and booked the yacht club instead without asking Sydney or me. We're paying now, so really, it's our reservation. I called Sydney about her mom unilaterally canceling everything. Stop being difficult. My parents are spending $40,000. It's their money, their wedding. Now they're paying, so they get final say. Those words, final say. Okay, I said, fair enough. Here's what Sydney didn't know. All vendor contracts were still in my name. Her parents had just been writing reimbursement checks, but I remained legally responsible. That evening, I contacted every vendor And transferred the contracts to Ronald Whitmore. Since the wedding was three months out, most were happy to accommodate. Thursday, I compiled everything into a folder and drove to their house, handed it to Ronald at the door. Since you and Lauren get final say, you should handle the contracts, too. His face went from smug to fused. When Lauren saw the financial obligations, her expression changed completely. These say we're responsible for all deposits and damages. Your wedding, your responsibility. You've got about $70,000 in outstanding balances due in the next six weeks. Ronald's face went purple. 70,000? You tripled the guest list. Catering went from $8,000 to $23,000. Heads up. This is insane. This is what you wanted? Your money, your final say, your contracts. Sydney called while I was driving home, screaming. Gave your parents what they wanted. Full control. You can't just dump this on them. It's their wedding, right? The fallout was SPECT Tacular. Ronald tried calling vendors to put contracts back in my name, but they needed my consent, which I wasn't giving. Sydney showed up, begging me to take back the contracts. The florist wanted $15,000 for her mom's orchid upgrade. I refused. Your parents wanted control. They got it. They're saying they won't pay. I guess there's no wedding Monday. Ronald called from his lawyer's office, threatening fraud charges. The lawyer quickly shut that down. I transferred contracts with full transparency, and Ronald had accepted them. Tuesday, the venue called Ronald's credit Card was declined for the five thousand dollar deposit. Without payment, by Friday, they'd release the date. I texted Sydney. Her response was a voice message of pure screaming. Wednesday, Sydney came to my office desperate to save the wedding. Her parents refused to sign contracts back over, figuring I'd cave and handle everything. So they're willing to ruin your wedding to win a power play? Just fix this.

What's wrong with my girl? I stepped out of the conference room already knowing something terrible had happened. Britney's voice was shaking as she explained. Nomi's fifth grade class was on their nature walk field trip in Riverside Woods. She'd eaten something at lunch and was having a severe allergic reaction. The nearest ambulance was stuck behind a jackknifed semi that had closed Route 47. The backup routes would take them 45 minutes. School's first aid kit somehow didn't have an Epipen, even though it was required. I was already running to my car while she talked. My hands fumbled with the keys as I calculated distances. The woods were 20 minutes away. If I drove normally, I could make it in 12 if I broke every traffic law. Nomi's emergency Epipen was in my glove compartment, where I always kept a spare. Sydney kept the phone on speaker so I could hear what was happening in the background. Nomi was crying and scratching at her skin. I made my foot press harder on the gas. I'd never heard her in that much pain before. Not when she broke her arm on the monkey bars, not when she needed stitches after falling off her bike. I blew through a red light, narrowly missing a pickup truck. Sydney was describing Noemi's symptoms to the 9 1 1 operator. On another phone. Hives spreading across her entire body, swelling in her face and hands. The itching so bad she was drawing blood with her fingernails. 10 minutes to the woods parking lot. That's what my G P S. Showed as I swerved around slower cars. But I knew the trail to the meadow where they held the nature walks. Another 15 minute hike through rough terrain. 25 minutes total. While my daughter's throat could be closing, Sydney's voice got more panicked. She says everything's getting blurry. She can't see right anymore. The mucus situation was getting worse, too. Sydney tried to stay calm while describing how it was pouring from Nomi's nose faster than they could wipe it away, like her body was trying to expel whatever poison she'd ingested. Through every possible route. The teacher was using up all their tissues and napkins. Took the exit for Riverside Woods at 60 miles per hour. The tires screamed as I barely made the turn. Behind me, I could hear sirens. Either someone had called in my reckless driving, or they were heading to know me, too. I prayed it was the second option. The parking lot appeared ahead. I skidded to a stop sideways across two spaces, and jumped out with the Epipen clutched in my sweaty hand. She's having trouble breathing now. It's getting worse. Kenny's voice through the phone sounded distant and tinny. I could hear Nomi wheezing in the background. The other kids were crying, too. Scared by watching their classmates struggle, the path split, and I took the left fork toward the meadow. My shirt was soaked with sweat. A branch caught my face, leaving A stinging cut. But I didn't slow down. Each second Nomi couldn't breathe, was potential brain damage. Through the trees, I finally saw them, A cluster of kids in bright field trip t shirts, surrounding something on the ground. I crashed through the underbrush, yelling that I had the medicine. The circle parted, revealing Nomi. Her face was swollen beyond recognition, eyes squeezed shut, lips blue. The wheezing had stopped, which was worse than hearing it. Sydney was on her knees, holding Nomi's hand, while the teacher tried to keep her airways open. I dropped beside them and ripped the Epipen from its case, pulled off the safety cap, jabbed it into Nomi's thigh, through her jeans.

My older sister, Denise, never let me forget. I was the family disappointment. Straight A's, student body president, Harvard Law School. She collected achievements like stamps. Why can't you be more like your sister? Became the soundtrack of my childhood. What no one knew was that while Denise celebrated her Harvard acceptance, I was quietly launching my first legal consulting business from my bedroom. By high school graduation, I had built a network of 50 law firms that relied on my research and strategies. None knew they were working with a teenager. By the time Denise graduated from Harvard Law, I owned controlling interest in seven major law firms across the East Coast through my shell companies. When Denise joined Preston and Hayes, Boston's most prestigious law firm, she didn't know I had acquired it six months earlier. She walked in not realizing her little sister was her boss. You should see my office. She gloated at Family Dinner. Corner Suite, partner track. Jack, what are you doing still with that consulting business? I smiled. Something like that. When I met Arthur at a charity gala, Denise tried to stake her claim. He's from Boston's oldest families. He's looking for someone successful. Not your scene, Anna. What Denise didn't know was that Arthur had met me as CEO of Mitchell Strategic Solutions. He was representing Blackwood International in acquisition negotiations, not realizing the CEO was the woman He was falling in love with. When Arthur proposed, Denise was livid. It doesn't make sense. She's nobody in the city. Something's not right. She insisted on being my maid of honor. To gather evidence, she spent months planning her moment of triumph. The ceremony was perfect. Boston's Trinity Church filled with the elite. As the minister asked if anyone objected, Denise Rose with a wicked smile. Actually, I have something to say. She pulled out a folder. Before we continue this farce, everyone deserves to know the truth about Anna Mitchell. My sister has been lying to all of you. She's been infiltrating law firms, manipulating business deals. I have proof. Bank records, shell companies. Getting back to her, she turned to Arthur. Did you know your bride isn't who she claims? That while you've been working on the Blackwood acquisition, she's been orchestrating it. She's not qualified to run anything. She never went to law school. You're right. I said standing, I never went to law school. I was too busy building an empire. I pulled out my phone and sent the prepared email. Throughout the church, phones buzzed as Boston's legal elite received the notification. Ladies and gentlemen, as of this moment, Mitchell Strategic Solutions has completed its acquisition of Blackwood International. This merger makes us the largest legal services corporation in New England. Denise's face went pale. What are you talking about? I'm not a lawyer. I own the law firms, including Preston and Hayes, where you've Been working. The folder slipped from her hands. That's impossible. Judge, could you confirm who owns controlling interest in your firm? Richard Hale stood up. Everything she says is true. Anna Mitchell is the CEO of Mitchell Strategy.

Mom wanted me gone. Three weeks later, police were involved. My husband's ex shows up at pickup after being gone for eight years and announces, you're done playing Mommy. I'm back. She hasn't seen her son since he was 4. Just disappeared one day to find herself and left my husband with a confused child asking why Mommy doesn't call anymore. Adrian stands there looking at their shoes while their biological mother explains how a kid needs their real parent, not some replacement. My husband looks exhausted and says, maybe she has a point. They should bond. He works 70 hours a week running his construction company. Which is why I know this is going to be a disaster, because I handle everything. But, sure, let them bond. I'm their mother. You just married their dad. She keeps emphasizing mother, like I don't know how biology works. Like I haven't been doing pick up and drop off and doctor's appointments and parent teacher conferences for two years, all while she was finding herself in Arizona with some guy named Carl. Well, I'm here now, my child. I don't need you. Fine. I pack up Adrian's special foods from my car, the ones for their specific texture issues, delete the 17 reminders for their schedule from my phone, hand her the inhaler I always carry because Adrian forgets theirs. She looks at it confused. He has asthma? She doesn't know her kid has asthma. Okay? I tell her, you're the Real parent I'll step back completely. She actually looks pleased with herself, but she has no idea what she's walking into. Day one Adrian shows up to school without their presentation that counts for 30% of their grade. X says kids need to learn responsibility. She doesn't know Adrian has executive dysfunction and needs three alarms plus a checklist. Day 2 Adrian eats cheese at lunch and throws up everywhere because X packed them a grilled cheese. Adrian texted me saying she asked since when are you lactose intolerant? Since always. I answered back for her. She'd know if she'd been here. Day 4 the teacher calls because Adrian punched the quiet kid. X believes Adrian when they say the kid deserved it for looking at them weird. I know the quiet kid is Adrian's only friend and they play fight as their weird inside joke, but I'm not the real parent so I say nothing. Now Adrian has lunch detention and no friends. Week 2 Adrian starts failing his tests. X doesn't know he needs to walk around while memorizing or their brain literally won't retain information. She tells him to try harder. Adrian gains 10 pounds in two weeks because X doesn't recognize their stress eating patterns. When AD and anxious, they'll eat an entire box of crackers without realizing. X just keeps buying more crackers. They're wearing the same hoodie every day and it smells like death. It's their favorite. She doesn't know it's their anxiety hoodie. And wearing it constantly means they're spiraling. Week three, the principal calls about concerning behavior. Adrian told the counselor they don't care about anything anymore. They're just being dramatic teens. You know, Adrian's best friend's mom calls me secretly because she still has my number. Your Adrian asked my kid for their Adderall. I thought you should know. X doesn't even know Adrian needs an ADHD evaluation. Doesn't know they can't focus without their specific routine. Then I see the scratches on Adrian's arms when I run into them at the store. Deep parallel lines. X says it's mosquito bites. In December? In Michigan? Friday afternoon, I'm at work when my husband calls, and his voice is shaking. Something's wrong.

That revealed something heartbreaking instead. I was teaching fifth grade in a small town when this quiet kid named Eli started showing up at my classroom door every morning. He'd wait there with this crumpled plastic grocery bag, looking nervous, until I unlock the door for the first time. It happened. I almost told him to wait in the hallway like everyone else, but then he pulled out this granola bar, juice box, and banana from his bag. Mister Carter, he said real quietly, can I sit in here if I share my breakfast with you? I thought it was the most adorable thing ever, this shy little kid wanting to eat breakfast with his teacher. So I said yes. It became our daily thing. Every single morning, Eli would show up with that same plastic bag, always the same three items. He'd sit at the desk closest to mine, and we'd eat together in comfortable silence. Sometimes he'd tell me about his weekend or ask questions about the math homework. I started looking forward to those 15 minutes before the chaos of the school day began. The other teachers thought it was sweet. That's so cute how Eli brings you breakfast, they'd say. I even bragged about it in the teacher's lounge. This kid is so thoughtful. He shares his breakfast with me every day. I felt special, like I was this kid's favorite teacher. After about two months, I noticed The food quality starting to change. The banana would have brown spots. The juice box felt warm. The granola bar wrapper was sometimes torn. One particularly rough morning, the banana was completely black on one side, and the juice box was so warm, it was probably spoiled. I was in a playful mood, so I teased him about it. You slacking on our deal today, buddy? Eli just laughed and said, nah, this was the best I could grab. Grandma says we got to stretch the fridge this week. That sentence hit me like a freight train. Stretch the fridge. I kept my smile, but my stomach dropped. I started asking gentle questions. Turns out Eli lived with his grandma and two younger siblings. His grandma worked the night shift at a factory and barely made enough to keep the lights on. This kid wasn't sharing his breakfast with me because he wanted to. He was giving me half of the only meal he was guaranteed to get that day because he thought it was required. When I asked him why he started bringing me food, his answer broke my heart. You said I could only sit in here if I shared. I didn't want to get in trouble. I had to excuse myself to the bathroom to cry. This kid had been going hungry every morning for two months because he misunderstood a casual comment.

Even before my parents signed the divorce papers, my older sister Cameron announced, I'm living with dad. He's got the corporate job making six figures. Mom's just a useless housewife who's been doing nothing for the past 15 years. I watched Mom's face just slightly before she forced to smile. That's okay, sweetie. Whatever makes you comfortable. Cameron rolled her eyes. It's not about comfort. It's about being smart. Dad's the one with actual money. She looked at me like I was an idiot when I said I'd stay with mom. Enjoy eating canned soup for dinner every night, she said, dragging her suitcase down the stairs. Mom watched her hop in Dad's car quietly and apologized to me for getting the wrong parent. I hugged her. You got this, mom. What I didn't know was that those words were the exact catalyst she needed to prove everyone wrong. Mom landed a job at target. Not exactly in a managerial position like dad, but she didn't stop there. Every evening, after cooking us dinner, she took online certifications. Project management, Quickbooks, data entry, whatever she could get her hands on. And within months, she moved from restocking supplies to a fancy new office job, bookkeeping for a local contractor, and later worked her way up to managing the entire back office operation. I was serious. Be so proud of her. Meanwhile, dad's situation was completely different. He couldn't balance his corporate job with actually parenting Cameron. He started missing meetings to drive her places, called in sick when she had school events. He spending hundreds on takeout every night, hiring cleaners weekly, paying for babysitters. Even though Cameron was 17, and the last time I saw him, he looked extremely frustrated. After months of repeated offenses at work, his performance tanked, and the promotion he'd been promised disappeared. And my sister completely oblivious to it, because as long as she had Dad's credit card in her pocket, why would she care, right? That is, until mom started her own virtual assistant business. She snagged her first client and quickly started handling five at a time. And I helped her however I could. When our clients reached beyond 20, mom hired her first employee, another mom who needed flexible work. The mom cried when she received the news. You're a blessing, she told her. They both worked hard to expand and hire more moms. And eventually, two years in, she had 12 employees and a real office space of her own, making more money than dad ever brought in. And as for dad, he unfortunately got laid off the same month mom signed the lease on her office. And my sister Cameron, following the scent of money, quickly jumped ship. After dad lost the nice townhouse in the city, my sister called us. Can I stay with you guys a bit? She asked in the sweetest voice. Mom immediately said, yes, of course. Family is family. Cameron arrived with her suitcases to find our house completely transformed. Mom had renovated everything. New kitchen, finished basement, the garage converted to a home office. Even the cars in the driveway had upgraded from Mom's rusty old truck to a beautiful silver BMW M4. And working under mom, I managed to snag a recently released James ACW Mini Cooper. My sister's jaw absolutely dropped. Oh my god, mom, you're so cool! She smiled. Thanks, sweetie. While Cameron went on and on about how luxurious everything was now, mom finally explained how living with her worked. Everyone who lives here works for the household, she said, passing the salad. That's how we built this. I nodded and told her how I worked on social media marketing, Mom's boyfriend Carl worked on logistics, even the college kid rent

Her friends were commenting laughing emojis, and girl, you're so real for this. I didn't say a word, just packed my things and left that night. Mia and I met at a music fest of all three years ago. She was a content creator with a growing social media presence. I'm a sound engineer for an indie recording studio, a job I love, but one that doesn't come with fame or fortune. Six months into dating, we moved into her rent controlled apartment. Everything seemed perfect, and the algorithm showed me something I was never meant to see. It was a Wednesday during my lunch break. I was browsing TikTok when a video appeared on my for you page. Mia in our apartment, lip syncing to trending audio about settling. I smiled, recognizing our living room, until I noticed myself in the background with headphones on, mixing a track. The caption hit me like a physical blow. Dating down builds character hashtag trust the process. As I checked the comments, my stomach dropped. Girl, oh, you're so real for this. The way he has no idea. Invest in potential, but don't wait forever. Mia's replies were worse. Got to start somewhere. The apartment is mine anyway. He's sweet, but this isn't the final stop. She'd film this while I was in the same room, captioned it to belittle me, and shared it with her. 67,000 Followers, people I'd never met, were dissecting my appearance, my career, speculating about my income. Everything suddenly made sense. Her reluctance to introduce me to work contacts, the way she's your conversations away from my career at parties for suggestions about more professional clothes. I wasn't her partner. I was her content, her charity case, her stepping stone. I didn't call her or text, just returned to the studio and focused on the session I was engineering. By evening, I made my decision. Mia was filming something in the living room when I got home. She smiled, paused her recording. Hey, thought we could order Thai Tonight? I nodded, walked past her to the bedroom. While she finished her content, I quietly packed a suitcase. Essentials. Clothes, documents, laptop. I took nothing that could be considered ours. When I emerged with my suitcase, she was reviewing footage. Going somewhere? She asked, barely looking up. Yes. She glanced at the suitcase, confused. What's going on? I showed her my phone, open to her TikTok, dating down Build's character. Her expression shifted from confusion to recognition to shame that it's just. It's content, babe. It's not serious. My followers eat that stuff up. It's just a persona I play online. The comments from your friends, those are persona, too. She became defensive. You're overreacting. Everyone exaggerates for social. It's not real life. It's real enough that you filmed me without my knowledge and mocked me to tens of thousands of people. I Picked up my suitcase. If I'm holding you back from whatever level you think you should be dating at, I'll remove myself from the equation. Don't be dramatic. It's just a stupid video. You're going to throw away our relationship over this? Our relationship ended the moment you decided I was content rather than a partner. I headed for the door. She called after me, her voice rising in panic as reality sank in. I didn't answer. Just got in my car and drove to a friend's place. That night, my phone blew up with messages from Mia. Defensive, angry, then careful. Apologies. I replied once. I deserve better than to be someone's stepping stone. Or social media punchline. Please don't contact me again. Then I blocked her number. Three days later, the artist whose breakup song I'd engineered posted a snippet on Instagram, tagging me. It caught attention in our local music.

So last month, I get this call from Mia's school asking me to come in because she was in trouble for breaking another kid's property. I'm thinking, what the hell? Because Mia is usually the kid who reminds the teacher when they forget to collect homework. I drop everything and drive over there, expecting maybe she accidentally knocked over someone's water bottle or something. I walk into the principal's office, and there's my daughter sitting in the chair with this huge grin on her face, like she just won the lottery. The principal, Mister Torres, starts going off about how she deliberately destroyed another girl's expensive necklace and how this behaviour is completely unacceptable and blah, blah, blah. Once he's done with his speech, I turn to Mia and ask her what actually happened. So here's the backstory. Last year, around Christmas time, Mia saved up all her allowance money for, like, three months to buy these matching best friend necklaces for her and this girl, Kaylee. They were these cute little heart ones that split in half with best on one side and friends on the other. I ordered them off some random website for 15 bucks, but to Mia, they might as well have been diamonds. Everything was great until this year, when their friendship went totally sideways. Turns out Kaylee was basically running this little extortion ring at school. She was threatening kids that if they didn't buy her stuff on Some mobile game. She'd spread rumors about them or make sure nobody would play with them at lunch. He was doing this to Mia, too, and when I found out, I told Mia to cut contact immediately. But here's where it gets really annoying. Even after Mia stopped hanging out with her, Kaylee kept demanding that Mia give her the other half of the friendship necklace so she could give it to someone else. Like, every single day, she'd walk up to Mia and be like, give me my necklace back. The fact that we bought both halves apparently didn't matter to this kid. My older nephew Tyler, heard about this drama and got really mad on Mia's behalf. He's 17 and super protective of his little cousins. The last weekend, when Mia was at my sister's house, Tyler and his twin brother Connor decided to help her with some therapeutic destruction. They got out hammers and pliers and went to town on that necklace charm until it was smashed into, like, eight tiny pieces. Mia thought this was the most hilarious thing ever and kept the broken pieces in her jewelry box. Well, apparently, Kaylee kept bugging her every day about the necklace, so finally, Mia had enough. She put all the broken pieces into a little plastic baggie and brought them to school during lunch. She walked right up to Kaylee's table, dumped out all the broken pieces in front of her, and said, here's your necklace back. You're gonna need some super glue and a lot of patience, because it's turned into a jigsaw puzzle. Kaylee completely lost it. Her face went bright red, and she started screaming and ran straight to the teacher, saying, Mia destroyed her property. Next thing I know, I'm getting called to come pick up my daughter from the principal's office. When Mister Torres finished his lecture,

Let's see if he can make it back. They laughed and drove away. I never came back. Standing at that Colorado gas station, watching their tail lights disappear, something inside me just broke. Five years of marriage, and Chloe thought abandoning me 300 miles from home was hilarious. No phone, no wallet, nothing. The gas station clerk, an older guy named Pete, saw me standing there looking lost. You all right, son? He asked. I explained what happened, expecting him to shake his head and walk away. Instead, he handed me a bottled water and said, some people ain't worth the ground they walk on. He even let me use his phone to call the local shelter. I hitched a ride to Grand Junction with a trucker who didn't ask questions, found a homeless shelter run by a former Marine named Roy. He handed me a clipboard and said, fill this out. Tomorrow we figure out the rest. That night, lying on a cot surrounded by strangers, I stared at the ceiling, thinking about Chloe's laugh as they drove away, how Stephanie had said, he'll figure it out. He always does. Like I was some kind of trained dog they could abandon for entertainment. Roy got me a job washing dishes at Jackie's for cash. The owner, a tough old woman covered in tattoos, paid me under the table. You running from something? She Asked one day, watching me scrub plates like my life depended on it. Running to something, I said. Turns out Jackie had connections. Real estate connections. She'd been flipping houses since the 90s. Knew every contractor, inspector and banker in town. You got a good head on your shoulders, she told me after I caught an accounting error that would have cost her thousands. Wanna learn the business? Six months later, I was swinging hammers and learning to read blueprints. Jackie taught me everything. How to spot a good deal, negotiate with contractors, manage cash flow. This ain't charity, she'd say. You're earning every dollar. Within two years, I owned three rental properties. Change my name legally to Marcus Stone. Felt right, felt solid. Found peace I'd never had with Chloe. No more walking on eggshells. No more being the butt of every joke at gatherings. I met Sarah at a hardware store. She was buying paint for her first apartment. Asked my advice on colors. We started dating. Slowly, carefully. When I told her my story, she just nodded and said, some chapters need to end before better ones can begin. We married three years later. Small ceremony. Just Jackie, Roy and a few close friends. Real friend. And who'd stick around when things got tough. Then last week, 15 years later, my phone started buzzing. Unknown No. 107 missed calls over two days. Finally answered. Mike? Oh, my God. Mike, is that you? I've been looking everywhere. Chloe's Voice desperate now crying. I hired a private investigator. It took months to find you. Mike, I'm so sorry. That day was the worst mistake of my life. My husband left me. I lost the house. The kids barely talk to me since the divorce. I have nothing left. Please, I need your help. I said quietly. You don't understand. I've been searching for you for years. I know you're successful now. I saw the business licenses, the properties. I know you can help me. We were married. That has to count for something. Chloe, I interrupted. You left me with nothing. Not even basic human decency. It was just a prank. The girls dared me. I never thought you'd actually stay gone. You never thought

You get nothing when we die. Then Grandma's lawyer called. She left me $2 million and a letter about their lies. I drove to their house with the biggest smile of my life. The call came Tuesday morning while I was eating cereal before my shift at Auto Zone. Unknown number. Almost didn't answer. Is this Marcus Chen? Yeah, that's me. This is Janet Walsh from Walsh and Associates. I'm calling about Eleanor Chen's estate. Your grandmother. My spoon dropped. Grandma, Eleanor died six months ago. My parents said I wasn't welcome at the funeral because I wasn't real family. There's been some mistake, I said. My parents told me she left everything to them and my brother. Silence then. Mister Chen, we need to meet today. Two hours later, I'm sitting in this fancy law office staring at documents that made zero sense. Grandma left me two. $2.1 million. Her house and investment accounts worth another $800,000. This can't be right, I stammered. I'm adopted. She wasn't really my grandmother. Janet handed me an envelope with my name and grandma's handwriting. Your grandmother insisted I give you this personally. She was very specific about the timing. I opened it with shaking hands. Marcus, you are not adopted. You're my biological grandson, son of my beloved daughter, Sarah. Sarah was David's first wife. She died in a car accident when you were 3 years old. David remarried Linda Six months later. Linda hated that you existed. You were proof of David's previous life. She wanted you gone. Wanted David to give you up for adoption so they could start fresh with their own children. I fought for you. I threatened to take them to court, expose what they were trying to do. They kept you, but Linda made your life hell as punishment. Every cruel word, every time they excluded you, every time they made you feel unwanted. That was Linda's doing. And David's cowardice in going along with it. I tried to maintain a relationship with you, but Linda made it impossible. She'd cancel visits, refuse to let you answer my calls. Eventually, they moved you all across states to keep you away from me. The last time I saw you, you were 15. I've missed six years because of their selfishness. I hired a private investigator to keep track of you. I know about the community college, the three jobs, the studio apartment you can barely afford. I know about the nights you ate nothing but ramen because you couldn't afford groceries. I know because I never stopped caring. I also know David and Linda have been telling everyone my estate will be equally among the grandchildren. They've been spending money they don't have, expecting a big inheritance. They're about to be very surprised. All my love, Grandma Eleanor. My hands were shaking as I finished reading. The truth hit me like a truck. I wasn't some unwanted adopted kid. I was her flesh. And blood cast aside by a stepmother who couldn't stand my existence. What do my parents think they're inheriting? I asked, and its smile was ice cold. Your grandmother LED them to believe they received the bulk of her estate. She encouraged this belief for years. Watching them dig themselves deeper into debt. How much have they spent? Based on our investigation, your father bought a 65 thousand dollar truck last year. Linda remodeled their entire kitchen for 50 thousand dollars. Your brother Logan got a 35 thousand dollar boat for graduation. They've taken out loans against the expected inheritance. Your parents currently owe $180,000 on credit and loans. I thought about my own life during that time. Working three jobs, eating ramen every night. Walking to work because my car died and I couldn't afford repairs. Asking for help with textbook money and being told I was too old for handouts. What are they actually getting? Janet consulted her papers. Logan and Ashley each receive $5,000. Your parents receive absolutely nothing. Your grandmother was very clear. David forfeited his right to inherit when he chose his new

Mom wanted me gone. Three weeks later, police were involved. My husband's ex shows up at pickup after being gone for eight years and announces, you're done playing Mommy. I'm back. She hasn't seen her son since he was 4. Just disappeared one day to find herself and left my husband with a confused child asking why Mommy doesn't call anymore. Adrian stands there looking at their shoes while their biological mother explains how a kid needs their real parent, not some replacement. My husband looks exhausted and says, maybe she has a point. They should bond. He works 70 hours a week running his construction company. Which is why I know this is going to be a disaster, because I handle everything. But, sure, let them bond. I'm their mother. You just married their dad. She keeps emphasizing mother, like I don't know how biology works. Like I haven't been doing pick up and drop off and doctor's appointments and parent teacher conferences for two years, all while she was finding herself in Arizona with some guy named Carl. Well, I'm here now. My child doesn't need you. Fine. I pack up Adrian's special foods from my car, the ones for their specific texture issues, delete the 17 reminders for their schedule from my phone, hand her the inhaler I always carry. Adrian forgets theirs. She looks at it confused. He has asthma? She doesn't know her kid has asthma. Okay, I tell her, you're the real parent. I'll step back completely. She actually looks pleased with herself, but she has no idea what she's walking into. Day one Adrian shows up to school without their presentation that counts for 30% of their grade. X says kids need to learn responsibility. She doesn't know Adrian has executive dysfunction and needs three alarms plus the checklist. Day 2 Adrian eats cheese at lunch and throws up everywhere because X packed them a grilled cheese. Adrian texted me saying she asked since when are you lactose intolerant? Since always. I answered back for her. She'd know if she'd been here. Day 4 the teacher calls because Adrian punched the quiet kid. X leaves Adrian when they say the kid deserved it for looking at them weird. I know the quiet kid is Adrian's only friend and they play fight as their weird inside joke, but I'm not the real parent so I say nothing. Now Adrian has lunch detention and no friends. Week 2 Adrian starts failing his tests. X doesn't know he needs to walk around while memorizing or their brain literally won't retain information. She tells him to try harder. Adrian gains 10 pounds in two weeks because X doesn't recognize their stress eating patterns. When Adrian's anxious, they'll eat an entire box of crackers without realizing. X just keeps buying more crackers. They're wearing the same hoodie every day and it smells like death. It's their favorite. She doesn't know it's their anxiety hoodie and wearing it Constantly means they're spiraling. Week three, the principal calls about concerning behavior. Adrian told the counselor they don't care about anything anymore. They're just being dramatic teens. You know, Adrian's best friend's mom calls me secretly because she still has my number. Your Adrian asked my kid for their adderall. I thought you should know. X doesn't even know Adrian needs an ADHD evaluation. Doesn't know they can't focus without their specific routine. Then I see the scratches on Adrian's arms when I run into them at the store. Deep parallel lines. X says it's mosquito bites. In December? In Michigan? Friday afternoon, I'm at work when my husband calls, and his voice is shaking. Something's wrong. His ex lost their kid at the mall three hours ago. He said he was going to the bathroom. That was at noon. It's now three. Troll car finds him at the bus station with a backpack full of clothes and $300 cash. When we pick him up from the police station, we ask, where did you get the money? Adrian says they've been selling their Ritalin. You don't take Ritalin? The ex says, as far as you know.

You won't mind, will you? They smiled like it was already decided. My sister Jennifer sat there twirling her hair, scrolling through dating apps, not even looking at me, while her three kids demolished my parents living room. It's just temporary, mom said, cutting her steak like we were discussing weekend plans, until David gets comfortable with kids being around. So let me get this straight. Jennifer wants to hide her three children from her new boyfriend, dump them with me for months, and I'm supposed to pay for daycare while she plays house? You don't understand what sacrifice means. Dad jumped in, waving his fork dramatically. Jennifer's given up everything for those kids. The audacity was absolutely unreal. Jennifer had been pawning her kids off on everyone for years. Last month she dropped them at our cousin's wedding reception and disappeared for the entire party. The month before that, she left them with our 80 year old neighbor, Missus Chen, while she went clubbing until 3 a m. Two months ago, she dumped them on me for a girls weekend that turned into 5 days. I nodded and kept eating my ribs and calm. Sounds like you've got it all figured out. The thing is, Jennifer finally looked up from her phone, eyes sparkling with greed. David's got serious money. Like country club money. I Already told him I don't have kids yet. Just need a few months to ease him into the idea of family life. And you'll somehow manage Emma, Jake, and Sophie during the day while you're working full time? Mom asked me to. Exactly. Like I wasn't even there to speak for myself. Oh, I figured Laura could find a babysitter. Jennifer shrugged casually. I'll be pretty tight on cash with David moving in. His place is expensive to maintain, so I'd be paying for full time childcare for kids that aren't mine. While she pretends to be child free to trap some wealthy guy. The plan was absolutely insane, even for Jennifer. But here's the thing. I'd overheard this entire manipulative scheme two weeks go from Jennifer's friend Sarah at the grocery store. Sarah felt guilty about the plan and spilled every detail. Jennifer had been orchestrating this deception for months, already telling Dave. But she was single with no kids, so I'd already moved out of my apartment and across town. I spent two weeks quietly packing during lunch breaks, found a perfect place near the river, transferred my lease, changed my address with work, updated my voter registration, forwarded my mail, the whole nine yards. My parents and Jennifer had absolutely no idea. Great, I said, standing up and wiping barbecue sauce from my hands. You can drop them off at my place tomorrow morning around 9. I'll be completely ready. Jennifer's face lit up like Christmas morning. Really? Oh, my god. Thank you so much. I knew you'd come through for family. Mom started tearing up. You're such a good sister, Laura. I gave them my old address with a straight face. You? No, the completely empty apartment I'd already vacated. The one with the bright for rent sign posted in the front window. That night, I turned off my phone completely and enjoyed my first peaceful evening in my beautiful new place. I ordered pizza, unpacked my last moving box, and watch Netflix without any guilt or interruptions. The next morning, Jennifer showed up at my old apartment complex with three enormous duffel bags. Car seats, toys, snack.

My mother ambushed me during a board meeting. If you don't bring someone to our anniversary gala, I'm calling Missus Mendez about her daughter. She's very interested in meeting you. Well, board members suddenly found their phones fascinating while their 35 year old CEO got threatened with an arranged marriage. After dismissing everyone, I walked past the break room and heard muffled crying from the bathroom. Through the door, I could make out Selena's voice. I understand, mom. I'll figure out the payment somehow. Just tell them we need two more weeks. Selena emerged with red eyes. She tried to hide behind her glasses. She'd been my assistant for two. Two years. Never late, never complaining, always staying past eight without being asked. Everything alright, I asked, though we both knew I'd heard. She straightened her blazer and forced her professional smile. Of course, Mister Pierce, did you need the quarterly reports? That's when I had the idea. Actually, I have a proposition, I said. Watching her reaction, $50,000 for three months of work, evenings and weekends. Her eyes widened, but she stayed composed. What kind of work? Being my girlfriend, fake girlfriend. I clarified contract basis, strict boundaries. We attend events together, hold hands in public, convince my parents I'm in a relationship. Three months until their anniversary passes. She stared at me for a full minute. You're serious? Completely. You need money for your Mother's medical bills. I need my parents off my back. Simple transaction. Within a week we had a 12 page contract. No feelings, no private touching, three dates weekly, public affection only when necessary. She slid the papers across. I added a termination clause. Either party can exit with 24 hours notice. I nodded. Remember, we've been dating three months. You call me sweetheart sometimes. We met when I started working here but kept it professional until recently. Her voice was clinical like reading a spreadsheet. First month was flawless. Selena transformed into the perfect girlfriend at charity galas and family dinners. Ready, darling, she'd say with a bright smile that never quite reached her eyes. She researched my colleagues wives, laughed at my father's golf stories, charmed my mother completely. In private, we maintained exact professional distance. She'd brief me like we were preparing for a merger. I should touch your shoulder when you mention the Tokyo deal, she'd say. Reviewing notes show support. We memorize things about each other. Your favorite color is blue. You're allergic to shellfish. We met at a charity auction. Two months. We were like the world's most professional actors. We had eight weeks left. Everything was perfectly on track. Then came the storm. Thunder crashed through my penthouse at midnight. Rain hammering the windows. The sound mixed with rumbling. And suddenly I was 15 again, trapped in our car as it hydroplane. My brother screaming, metal crunching, then silence. The panic attack hit Like a freight train, my chest locked, vision tunneling, legs buckling, I collapsed beside my bed, gasping for air that wouldn't come through the roaring in my ears. I heard my door opening. Selena's voice called out, Mister Pierce, you left these contracts. I thought you'd need them for tomorrow. She found me on the floor, shaking, drenched in sweat. Without hesitation, she dropped everything and knelt beside me. Look at me breathe.

Oh, right, you don't have any. My parents laughed, so I said, where's your money? Oh, right. I've been supporting you until today. For seven years, I've been the unofficial safety net for my entire family. When my younger brother Jason couldn't make rent, I covered it. When mom's car broke down, I paid for repairs. When dad's consulting business had slow months, I slipped him money. I never complained. I told myself it was what a good son should do. And till that Sunday afternoon when everything changed. We were all in my parents living room, half watching football, when Jason turned to me with this smug grin and said, so, Brian, where's your wife and kids? Oh, right, you don't have any. Mom actually laughed, had chuckled. Jason leaned back like he delivered the punch line of the century. I sat there stunned. Jason's always been the golden boy. Younger, more charismatic. The one who turns every bad decision into a charming anecdote. But something about that moment, with everyone laughing at me while I bankrolled their lives, hit differently. When the laughter died down, I looked at Jason and said, where's your money? I've been supporting you until today. The room went dead silent. Jason's grin faltered. For the first time ever, I'd spoken to them with finality. Jason recovered quickly. Wow. Touchy much? It was just a joke, Brian. Dad shifted in his chair. You can't expect Tim, to be as responsible as you. Jason's young. He's just having fun. That line was gasoline on fire. I'd heard it my whole life. Jason wasn't held to the same standards. J didn't have to get straight A's or pay rent when he moved back home after dropping out. Jason just had to show up and smile. I didn't argue. I just stood up, grabbed my jacket, and left. That night, I reviewed bank statements. Nearly $86,000 had gone to my family over seven years. I'd made it way too easy for them. The next week, dad called. The mortgage is due, and you haven't sent anything this month. I'm not doing that anymore. I said. You can't just stop. We rely on that money. That's the problem. He hung up on me. At Sunday dinner, mom said, we can't keep going like this. Your father and I have bills. Jason has student loans. Jason dropped out of college. I pointed out you make enough to help. She continued. That was before I realized I'm the only one here trying to be an adult. Jason looked up, smirking. So now you're better than us because you have money? No, I'm better than you because I work for it while you burn through my paycheck. Jason rolled his eyes. Whatever. You're still single. Can't be that great of a life. That's when something inside me went ice cold. I put my fork down and said, I'm not paying for anything. Else? Not the mortgage, not Jason's rent, nothing. If you lose the house, that's on you. Dad slammed his hand on the table. I walked out. The calls started immediately. Voicemails about how I was tearing the family apart. But I felt no guilt. Three weeks later, they showed up at my apartment. We went to the bank, dad said, pulling out a folder.

I need an alpha. I replied, I understand. Jessica sat me down in our living room last Tuesday with this rehearsed speech about how she needed someone who takes charge, a real leader. Then came the kicker. She'd been getting close to my coworker, Mark from marketing. He's everything you're not, Michael, she said, her voice dripping with condescension. Confident, ambitious, going places. You're just comfortable being mediocre. I sat there quietly while she explained how Mark was about to get promoted to regional director, the position that would make him everyone's boss, including mine. She'd even been feeding him insider information from her role in HR to help his application look stronger. Once Mark gets that promotion, we'll be the power couple of the office, she grinned, practically glowing with excitement. He's already talking about the company car, the corner office, the executive perks. That's the kind of man I need. She went on about how Mark commanded every room he entered, how he closed deals with a handshake, how he had that killer her instinct that I apparently lacked. She said watching him work made her realize what she'd been settling for all these years. You're a great guy, Michael, but you're just not leadership material. You'll always be support staff, she said, patting my shoulder like I was a child. Mark sees the big picture. He takes risks. He makes things happen. The insult stung. Because it was so calculated. She'd clearly been thinking about this for months, comparing us, weighing our worth like commodities. In her mind, she was trading up. I need someone who fights for what they want, she continued. Someone who doesn't just accept things as they are. Mark would never just sit there quietly like you're doing right now. I simply said, I understand and went to bed. Here's what she didn't know. Three weeks ago, corporate had secretly offered me that same regional director position. They said Mark looked impressive in meetings, but consistently made promises the technical team couldn't deliver. His strategy sounded great, but ignored crucial operational realities. We need someone who understands both sides, the VP had told me during our confidential meeting. Someone who can actually execute, not just sell dreams. Mark's proposals look flashy, but half of them would bankrupt us if we tried to implement them. The VP explained that while Mark was great at client presentations, he caused three major project delays in the past year by over promising capability. What is we didn't have. Meanwhile, my quiet efficiency had been saving the company millions by designing systems that actually worked. I've been hesitant to accept because I genuinely enjoyed my current role as senior systems architect. I like solving complex problems, building things that work. Management politics wasn't appealing. But after Jessica's speech about needing an alpha and her casual dismissal of my capabilities, my hesitation completely disappeared. Her betrayal had Clarified everything. Monday morning, I walked into the VP's office and accept to the position. Outstanding choice, Michael, he said, shaking my hand firmly. We'll announce it Wednesday. I have to say, we were hoping you'd come around. The board was unanimous. You're exactly what this company needs. At Tuesday, Mark was already celebrating. Prematurely. I heard him on a call with a client making promises about timeline and capabilities that were completely unrealistic. He'd even ordered business cards with regional director printed on them. Jessica texted me from HR saying she was so excited for the big announcement tomorrow and that she'd already made dinner reservation.

My two best friends, Mia and Jade, had this belief that every boyfriend needed to be tested. They done it with every guy in our friend group. Hidden cameras, fake emergencies, planted temptations, always claiming it was saving us from heartbreak. When Mia discovered my boyfriend Ryan had been jewelry shopping, they told me they wanted to run the test on him. Three years means nothing if he can't pass a simple loyalty test, Ade insisted. Better to know now than after. You're engaged. We're trying to protect you. I protested that Ryan was different, that I trusted him completely. But they wore me down with stories of friends who'd been blindsided, marriages that crumbled, women who wished they'd known sooner. If he passes, you'll never doubt him again. Mia promised. One hour of discomfort for a lifetime of certainty. Against every instinct screaming no, I agreed. The plan was simple. I'd text Ryan about a fake emergency at Mia's apartment, then hide in the bedroom with my laptop while Mia answered the door. Jade had set up her phone as a hidden camera in the living room, barely visible unless you knew where to look. My hands shook with hesitation and fear as I texted Ryan, I'm at Mia's having a panic attack. Please come quickly. Ryan replied instantly, I'll be there in 10 minutes. Those 10 minutes felt like hours as I sat on Mia's bed with my laptop. Open. Watching the empty living room through Jade's camera feed. When the doorbell rang, my heart hammered so hard I thought I might actually have a panic attack. Mia answered the door, wearing a silk robe. Ryan, your girlfriend just stepped out to get air. Come in. Let's wait for her. On screen, I watched Ryan's confused face and concerned glances around the apartment. Mia guided him to the couch, sitting unnecessarily close. She's been so stressed lately, Mia heard, placing her hand on his arm. Ryan shifted away, clearly uncomfortable. Maybe I should call her, he said, reaching for his phone. Mia's hand moved to his chest. She'll be back soon. Relax. Fingers traced patterns on his shirt. You know, I've always thought you were incredibly attractive. Ryan froze. Mia, what are you doing? She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a whisper I could barely hear through the camera. She doesn't have to know. We can keep this between us. I know you want this, too. Ryan's whole body tensed as she pressed against him, trying to push him back into the couch cushions. Stomach turned watching his obvious discomfort, the way his hands stayed firmly at his sides, his body angled away from her. Suddenly, Ryan pushed Mia away and stood up, his face flushed with anger. What the hell is wrong with you? His eyes swept the room and for a moment seemed to lock directly on the camera. Something flickered across his face. Realization, maybe? Before he headed for the door, Mia grabbed his arm. Wait, Ryan, I can explain. But he yanked free and was gone, the door slamming behind him. I heard his car tear out of the parking lot. The next morning, after a sleepless night, I drove to his house, desperate to explain. He opened the door, but blocked my entry with a cold expression. I need to tell you something I started about last night. The test, he interrupted. I know. I saw the camera. I saw it watching me while your friend threw herself at me. I noticed his eyes were squinting and realized that he was both angry and disappointed. Ryan, I'm so sorry. They convinced

Jessica texted me from HR saying she was so excited for the big announcement tomorrow and that she'd already made dinner reservations to celebrate Mark's promotion. She seemed to think I'd be happy for them. Wednesday at 2 p m, the company wide email went out introducing me as the new regional director, effective immediately. My first directive was restructuring the marketing promises to align with actual technical capabilities, essentially undoing everything Mark had been promising clients. Mark got his rejection email

Changed everything about that Cabo trip. I texted our family group chat emergency app endoscopy tomorrow. Need someone to pick up Max from daycare. My sister Amber replied, lol can't. We're literally boarding for Cabo right now. Mom added, ask your neighbor. This trip cost us $3,000. I simply wrote, got it. My four year old son, Max had been asking all week why Aunt Lily and grandma couldn't help when daddy was sick. I told him they were on an important trip. He nodded seriously and said, more important than you getting better. The drive to the hospital at 5 a m. Was terrifying. Max's overnight bag was packed with his stuffed elephant and three days worth of clothes. Missus Chen, my 74 year old neighbor, met us at her door in her bathrobe. She spoke broken English but hugged Max like he was her own grandson. Don't worry, she whispered to me. I take good care. What was supposed to be a routine appendectomy turned into a nightmare. Internal bleeding kept me unconscious for eighteen hours. When I woke up, machines were beeping and tubes were everywhere. The surgeon explained I'd need to stay at least six days for monitoring. My phone had dozens of missed calls, but none from family. Instead, there were voicemails from Mrs. Chen in her careful English. Max eating good breakfast. He helped me water plants. He very good boy. Day three I was finally stable enough to Facetime Max, sitting at Mrs. Chen's kitchen table, carefully folding dumplings with tiny fingers covered in flour. Daddy! Mrs. Chen teaching me to make food. She says I'm very smart. He held up a lopsided dumpling proudly. In the background, Mrs. Chen beamed and gave me a thumbs up. That same day, my phone rang. Hospital administration. Mr. Rodriguez, your mother called demanding to speak with your doctor about visiting hours. She was quite insistent about getting details regarding your condition. When we explained you've been here since Monday with complications from emergency surgery, she became extremely upset. I was confused. She called you? Yes. She seems surprised you were here at all. She mentioned something about thinking you were being dramatic about a simple teacher. Thirty minutes later, my phone exploded. Mom? Daniel, why didn't you tell us you were dying? Amber? OMG, I'm literally shaking RN. I had no idea it was serious. Mom, again? We're booking flights home right now. This is insane. I was too weak to respond immediately, but I managed to piece together what happened through a friend who'd seen Amber's Instagram stories. She'd been posting beach content all week, including a story yesterday of Max eating breakfast at some random Asian lady's house with I'm laughing emojis. The caption read, my brother's parenting choices are wild. Like, why is my nephew at a stranger's house? Elmo, A family friend, Mrs. Rodriguez from church, had in the story, And called mom in a panic. Why is little Max staying with strangers? Where's Daniel? Is everything okay? Mom had apparently brushed it off, saying I was being dramatic about a minor surgery, and that I was probably partying or dating someone new while Max stayed elsewhere. But Mrs. Rodriguez kept pressing. It's been four days, Maria. A four year old shouldn't be away from his father that long. Unless something's really wrong.

Marriage is a complete nightmare, bro. I wake up every day regretting my decision. If it wasn't for her family's money, I'd be gone already. I froze on the stairs. We just celebrated our three year anniversary last week. He'd cried reading his vows tell. Telling me I was the best thing that ever happened to him. The vow renewal thing, pure torture, man. Had to stand there making up romantic bullshit while her family looked on all mystied. I've gotten good at the performance, though. Oscar worthy. He actually laughed. My heart shattered into a million pieces. But hey, small price to pay for the lifestyle, right? Her dad's talking about bringing me into the family business next year. Once I'm established there, I'll have options. More options than just being the money wife's husband. The money wife. That's what he calls me behind my back. I quietly left and returned at my normal time, greeting him with a kiss like nothing happened. The taste of betrayal was bitter on my lips. Five days I've been living this nightmare. Sleeping next to someone who calls our marriage a complete disaster behind my back. Every morning I wake up wondering how I missed all the signs. But I haven't been sitting around crying. I've been busy. Moving money from our joint accounts into my personal one. Changing passwords on everything, getting my Financial ducks in a row. I discovered he's been making weird withdrawals for months. 200 here, 300 there. Always just under the amount we agreed needed discussion. Where was that money going? Another woman. Savings for his eventual escape. Yesterday, I casually mentioned my dad might be scaling back his business due to health concerns. Complete lie. But Connor's face went white as a sheet. Suddenly he was asking all these detailed questions about Dad's retirement plans and our future security. Not once did he ask about Dad's supposed health issues. I've been making subtle changes, too. Taking more private calls, working late, seeing just a little less affect. Mentioning casual conversations with our family lawyer. And Connor is absolutely losing it. Two nights ago, I caught him going through my closet while I was in the shower. Yesterday, he was scrolling through my search history on the iPad. Deliberately left searches for signs your husband is cheating and separate bank accounts for him to find. The psychological warfare is working. He's been frantically fixing things around the house that he's ignored for months. The squeaky bathroom door, the wobbly kitchen table, the broken porch light. It's like watching someone desperately trying to prove their value. Last night, he suggested we renew our vows again for the second time in three weeks. The desperation in his eyes was almost pathetic. When I asked why the sudden interest, he stammered something about celebrating our love with everyone important to us. Translation He's panicking about his gravy train derailing and wants to

I slammed on the brakes and jumped out of my car. Nora, baby, what are you doing out here? She was shivering violently. And just her school clothes, no coat. Tears frozen on her little cheeks. Daddy locked me out. He said, I can't come back until you get home from work. My heart dropped. It was nine PM on a Friday. Jonathan knew I always worked late on Fridays. This wasn't an accident. How long have you been out here? Since you left this morning, she whispered. I scooped her up, feeling how ice cold her little body was, and carried her toward our front door. It was locked. I used my key, re rebuilding with every step. I found Jonathan exactly where I expected. Sprawled on the couch in his boxers and T-shirt, controller in hand, playing call of duty. The heat was cranked up to 75 degrees. Empty beer cans littered the coffee table. Why was our daughter outside for 12 hours? I tried to keep my voice calm. He didn't even pause his game. She spilled grape juice on my new controller this morning, I told her. Actions have consequences. I stared at him in disbelief. She's 6 years old, Jonathan. She spilled juice accidentally and you left her outside to freeze? Maybe next time she'll be more careful around my stuff. That's when I noticed Nora's Pink backpack sitting by the front door. It was stuffed full, bulging at the seams. Her favorite stuffed bunny was sticking out the top. What's this? I pointed at the bag. Jonathan finally paused his game and turned to look at me. There was something cold in his eyes I'd never I've seen before. I've been doing a lot of thinking today. While she was outside, he said slowly, this whole family thing isn't working out for me. Nor is too much work, too expensive, too loud. And honestly, I never wanted kids in the first place. The room started spinning. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you taking her and leaving. Night. I already had the locks changed while you were at work. You just got lucky I hadn't switched them out yet. I felt like I was in a nightmare. You're abandoning your own daughter? Nora was still clinging to me, her wet clothes soaking through my work blazer. She was listening to every word, her big brown eyes darting between us. Here's the thing. Jonathan stood up, stretching like this was all perfectly normal. She's not really mine anyway. I mean, yeah, biologically, whatever. But I never signed up for this dad life. You can have her. The casual cruelty in his voice made me sick. This was the man I've been married to for eight years. The man who used to read Nora bedtime stories. Jonathan, she's your daughter. You can't just watch me He picked up his phone. I already talked to my buddy Steven, who's a lawyer. Apparently, if I just voluntarily give up my parental rights, I don't have to pay child support either. Win win. My hands started shaking, but not from fear. From rage. I pulled out my phone and speed filed a number I'd hoped I'd never have to use. Hi, Christine, it's Caroline. Remember that emergency custody documentation we discussed 6 months ago? File everything.

His parents showed up at our door in March without even asking. His mom literally called and told me they were coming to wait out quarantine at our place, like not asked, told me. And I already knew this was gonna suck because they've always treated me like garbage. They make these snide comments about everything I do, act like they own the place and basically think I'm not good enough for their precious son. Right from day 1, they started running our apartment like it was theirs. They tell me what to cook, when to clean, how loud my music could be. But the worst part was the stupid air conditioning fight that went on for weeks. It's been like 85 degrees every single day here and I keep the AC at 70 because that's comfortable. But nope, they started whining about being cold, so I compromised and put it at 75. I'm already sweating my butt off, but whatever. I'm trying to keep the peace. That wasn't good enough, though. They wanted the heat on in 90 degree weather. The heat, I'd wake up in the middle of the night literally drenched in sweat because they'd sneak over and crank the thermostat up to like 80 degrees. I told them to stop messing with it probably 20 times, but they kept doing it anyway. So yesterday morning before work, I grabbed a Roll of duct tape and put like 10 pieces over the thermostat. I even wrote a note that said do not touch the thermostat while I am at work, in big letters. Pretty clear, right? I get home at six PM and it hits me like a wall of heat. The second I open the door. It's hotter inside than it is outside, which shouldn't even be possible. The duct tape is ripped off. My note is crumpled up on the floor and they've got the heat cranked to 98 freaking degrees, 98. I checked the thermostat three times because I couldn't believe it. I marched straight to the guest room where they're just chilling like nothing happened. His mom is sitting there filing her nails and his dad is watching some cooking show. I'm like dripping sweat already. And I go, why could you not follow the simple instruction of do not touch the thermostat? This is my home. I'm tired of you saying rude things to me. I'm tired of you treating me like a child and making your own rules for my apartment. You either need to respect me and my boundaries or go back to your own house. His mom doesn't even look up from her nails at first. Then she gets this nasty look on her face and says, you have no right to barge in here without knocking. That was not only an invasion of privacy, but you need to take the attitude out. Of your tone, dealt with much bigger bitches than you before. That's when I completely lost it. She called me a bitch in my own apartment after I let them stay here for free, after I've been bending over backwards trying to make them comfortable, after they've been treating me like dirt for months. She kept going on and on for like 30 minutes about how disrespectful I am and how I need to learn my place and all this other garbage. I just stood there like.

I understand, she finally said. But I could hear her heart breaking through the phone. I'll always love you. The line went dead. Two years passed. My mother's health stabilized, but the fear kept me trapped. Then my father had a stroke. See, my mother said, this is why the tradition exists. We need you. That night, I found Sarah's number in my old phone. She'd moved to Seattle, gotten promoted, was dating someone new. I stared at her photos until my eyes burned. She looked happy. Free. The breaking point came during my cousin's wedding. I would 28, still living in my childhood bedroom. My cousin's new wife asked innocently, so when are you getting married? The table went silent. She can't, my mother answered. For me. She has responsibilities. I excused myself.

In my family, the youngest child never leaves home. Ever. For six generations, the youngest has stayed to care for aging parents until they die, then inherits everything, while the older siblings get none. My grandmother passed at 94 with my aunt by her side. It's an honor, my parents always said. The youngest gets rewarded for their sacrifice. I watched my older siblings escape one by one. My sister moved to California for college and never came back. My brother enlisted in the military the day he turned 18. Only I remained, the chosen one, the family caretaker. When my brother got married, he pulled me aside at the reception. You don't have to do this, he whispered, guilt heavy in his voice. I forced a smile. Someone has to carry on the tradition. But inside, I was screaming. I was 16 and already felt the invisible chains tightening around my ankles. I became the perfect youngest child. Straight A's, but only at the local community college. No dating, because relationships distract from family duties. I watched my friends leave for universities while I stayed home, learning to cook my mother's recipes and manage my father's medications. I met Sarah at the hospital during one of Dad's checkups. She was a nurse. And when she smiled, something inside me cracked open.

When I turned 18, mom handed me the small wooden box with a lock on it. Open this when you're ready, she said. I wasn't ready. For two whole years, the box just sat on my dresser, collecting dust. During my sophomore year of college, I was cleaning my dorm room and found it again. I finally got curious enough to break the lock with a paper clip. Inside were letters, like dozens of them, all addressed to me in handwriting I didn't recognize. The return address was from some town called Millfield, about two hours from where we lived. None of the letters had been opened. They were all from my dad. Every single birthday from when I was 4 until I turned 18. The earliest ones had little stick figure drawings on the envelopes. The recent ones just had my name written really carefully. Couldn't breathe. My hands were shaking as I opened the first one. It was from my fourth birthday. He wrote about wishing he could take me to get ice cream and how He hoped I liked the toy truck he tried to send. There was no toy truck. Mom never gave me any of this stuff.

The next day, I stormed into the principal's office with the medical report and asked, do you think torturing special needs kids is part of your curriculum?

I worked IT at a small high school called Riverside Academy. The principal kept bugging me about slow internet in the teachers lounge. She called me three times in one week saying the Wi Fi was terrible and teachers couldn't even check their email. I figured it was probably the old microwave interfering with the signal, or maybe their cheap router was dying. Nothing too crazy. But when I went to check the network, I noticed something weird. There was a new device connected called Voices Whopper One. I'd never seen that name before. I pinged it and got a response, which meant it was active. I tried to SSH into it, but couldn't get access, so I fired up a network sniffer to see what kind of traffic it was sending. The packets weren't normal web traffic or file transfers. They were audio packets. Live audio streaming from somewhere inside the school building. My stomach dropped. Someone was broadcasting sound from inside our school, and I had no idea who or why. It took me three hours to trace the signal through our network. The trail LED me to a maintenance area above the janitor's closet. I had to crawl through this.

My boyfriend Jake and I had been together for, like, eight months, and things were going pretty well. Then one Tuesday morning, I get this text from him that just says, I think we need to talk about us. This isn't working anymore. I literally felt my stomach drop. I'm sitting there in my pajamas eating cereal before work, and this dude just dumps me over text. I tried calling him, but it went straight to voicemail. I texted back asking if we could talk in person, but he left me unread. By lunchtime, I was convinced it was over. My coworker Ashley was like, girl, you need a rebound. But honestly, I wasn't ready for that. Instead, I did something way more impulsive. I drove to the animal shelter after work that same day. I've been wanting a dog for years, but Jake was always like, we're not ready for that responsibility. Well, guess what, Jake? Now I don't need your permission. There was this three year old golden retriever mix named Buddy who'd been there for two months. Shelter lady said his previous family had to give him up because they were moving overseas. He was the sweetest thing, just sitting there, wagging his tail at everyone who walked by. I filled out all the paperwork and paid the adoption fee right there. Two hundred bucks later, I'm driving home with a dog in my Backseat. I spent the entire evening at Petsmart buying everything. Dog bed, toys, food, bowls, leash, collar, the works. Dropped like $400.

Now she's paying for the joke no one's laughing at. This all happened last weekend and I'm still reeling from it. I don't drink, never have. My parents were both alcoholics and my childhood was a living hell. I've spent years in therapy working through the trauma, and just the smell of alcohol can trigger a panic attack. My husband Alex knows all of this. His family knows all of this. Every year, Alex's family hosts a big summer barbecue. It's usually a fun event. Lots of cousins, aunts, uncles. His sister Clara has always been a bit competitive with me. She's always trying to one up me or make little snide remarks, but I usually just brush them off. I figured it was just sisterly rivalry. This year Alex had to work an emergency shift, so I went alone. I felt a little anxious, but I wanted to support his family. When I arrived, everyone was already there, drinks in hand. Clara immediately came over, all smiles. Hey sis! So glad you can make it. Can I get you anything? I smiled back genuinely and said, just a sparkling water, please. You know me. She nodded, walked off, and returned a minute later with a glass. I took a big gulp. It was definitely sparkling water. I relaxed a little. A while later, she came over again. Another one? I said, yes, please. This time. As I took a sip, I immediately knew something was wrong. It wasn't just sparkling water.

When my son Owen was 12, he was hit by a drunk driver while riding his bike home from soccer practice. He survived, but his throat and vocal cords were damaged so severely that the doctors told us he might never speak again. He could eat, he could breathe, and maybe. Maybe one day, with a ton of work, he can make some sounds. But words? Probably not. He took it hard, but he wasn't angry. He was more quiet, which sounds obvious, I know. But not just because he couldn't speak. He stopped trying. No whiteboard, no phone notes, not even hand signals. Was like if he couldn't speak the way he used to, he didn't want to speak at all. His little sister, June, who was six at the time, didn't get it. Before the accident, they were inseparable. Morning cereal together, trading Pokemon cards, arguing over whose turn it was to feed the dog. But after, Owen would just give her a tired smile when she talked to him. Sometimes he type short answers in his notes app, but June was too little to read fast. He'd stare at the screen trying to make sense of what he meant while he waited, watching her get frustrated.

Sunny showed up 25 minutes late wearing gym clothes, did and apologize, and immediately started complaining about how pretentious and overpriced the restaurant was. Keep in mind he suggested this place during appetizers. Funny. Launched into this condescending lecture about how my marketing degree was basically useless and I should consider switching to something more practical like accounting. When I mentioned I actually enjoyed my job at a creative agency, he laughed and said, yeah, but what's your backup plan for when you realize you need real money? The way later brought our entrees and sunny sent his pasta back twice. First because it was too salty, then because it was too bland. He was incredibly rude to every staff member who approached our table. But the absolute worst part started during the main course. Sunny began getting increasingly aggressive. Whenever I disagreed with literally anything he said, his voice kept getting louder and other diners were starting to stare. When I politely said I had different political views, he slammed His fork down and said, that's because women don't understand economics. I tried excusing myself to the bathroom, hoping to regroup and figure out how to end this nightmare. Sunny grabbed my wrist as I stood up and said sit down.

Made babysitter and pet sitter all in one. So my neighbour Kendra moved in next door about eight months ago with her two kids and this ancient golden retriever that barks at literally everything. At first she seemed cool enough. She brought over cookies when she moved in, and we chatted over the fence a few times about normal neighbour stuff. But then it started. First it was just asking me to grab her Amazon packages when she wasn't home. No big deal, right? Then it turned into can you let Buddy out to pee? Because she was running late from work. Still fine, I guess, but then she started asking me to watch her kids, Jackson and Presley, after school because her babysitter flaked. Just for like an hour, she said. That hour turned into three hours. Then it became a regular thing. Every Tuesday and Thursday I'd hear her car pull up and she'd knock on my door asking if I could take the kids until she got back from whatever she was doing. The kids were actually pretty good, but that wasn't the point. I work from home. Doing graphic design and trying to focus while two kids are asking for snacks and fighting over the T. V. Remote isn't exactly productive. The dog situation got worse too. She started leaving Buddy in my backyard when she went out because apparently he had separation Anxiety and would destroy her furniture. This dog would whine and bark for hours. My own dog hated having him there. And they'd get into these weird territory battles over toys. Last month, she asked me to keep the kids overnight because she had a date. A date? I told her I couldn't, and she got all huffy, saying she never asks for anything big. When I pointed out that I literally watch her kids twice a week and her dog almost daily, she said that was just neighbor stuff, and this was different. Then two weeks ago, she knocked on my door at 11 p m. Asking if I could take Buddy because her upstairs

But did she forget I still own the house? I'm a 35 year old electrician who's been working construction since I was 18. Built up a decent savings, bought my house when I was 28. A nice three bedroom ranch with a big backyard and a two car garage. Nothing fancy, but it was mine. Paid for with my own sweat and overtime hours. Two years ago, I married Amanda, who seemed responsible and down to earth as a mental hygienist. I kept the house in my name to protect my assets. After seeing my brother's messy divorce about six months ago, things changed. Amanda became critical of everything, started spending more time at the gym, bought new clothes, and often had late yoga classes. I wasn't born yesterday. The signs were all there, but I figured I'd let it play out and see what she was really up to. Last Tuesday, while working downtown, I got a text from Amanda. I'm done with this marriage. Change the locks. Brad's moving in this weekend. My lawyer will contact you about dividing assets. Brad, her personal trainer from the fancy gym across town. The pieces clicked into place immediately. I'm standing there in my work boots, tool belt around my waist, reading this message twice to make sure I understood it correctly. This woman really thought she could just kick me out of my own house and move Her boyfriend in, like, some kind of real estate hostile takeover. My coworker Mike saw my face and asked what was wrong. I showed him the text, and he just started laughing. Dude, she knows you actually own that place, right? That's when it hit me. Amanda had always acted like we owned the house together, but she'd never seen the deed, never been involved in property taxes, never dealt with homeowners insurance. In her mind, marriage automatically meant shared ownership of everything. I called my buddy Steve, who's a real estate agent. Steve, remember how you said my house would sell fast in this market? How fast are we talking

The judge gave me full custody that same day. My ex husband, Dave, had been planning this moment for six months. Ever since our divorce went through in January, he'd been telling everyone at his gym how he was going to destroy his greedy ex wife once and for all. He even bought a new boat to celebrate what he called his upcoming and victory. The divorce papers weren't even filed away. Before Dave started his plan. He'd hired a lawyer who'd never lost a custody case in 20 years, paying him triple his usual rate. He started keeping notes of every single thing I did, twisting normal stuff into proof I was a bad mother. Even though he'd show up late for every pickup, then report me for harassment when I asked where he was. He'd forget to give Janae her medicine on purpose, then call child services when she got sick at school. Your mom is going to get what she deserves, he'd tell Janae during his weekends. Daddy's going to make sure you live with the right parent. Janae was only 8. She started crying every Friday night before going to his house. I couldn't fight back. Dave had money, connections, and a paper trail, making me look unstable. My legal aid lawyer told me to just document everything and pray. But how do you fight someone who's three steps ahead? So there I was, standing in The Walmart parking lot at our usual exchange spot. Janae's overnight bag slung over my shoulder. The December wind cut through my worn jacket. The good coat went to pay for Janae's therapy. Dave pulled up in his freshly waxed BMW, windows tinted so dark you couldn't see inside. He stepped out wearing his designer sunglasses despite the overcast sky, that smirk plastered across his face that made my stomach turn. Janae, sweetie, go wait by daddy's car, Dave said, his voice dripping with fake sweetness. Mommy and I need to talk. I held Janae's hand tighter, but she looked up at me with those big brown eyes. I kissed her forehead and watched her walk over. That's when Dave pulled out his phone. Funny thing happened yesterday, he said, stepping closer. Someone called in a tip about a drug dealer matching your description.

His parents live like 30 minutes away, and they came over the night before to wish us goodbye and all that. Everything was going fine until his mom started being way too helpful. She kept asking if I packed vitamins and sunscreen and all this stuff. Then she offered to put some vitamin tablets in my suitcase for me. At first I was like, thanks, I'll do it myself. But then she was all insistent like, oh, no, it's fine. I can just put them in there. So I was like, okay, fine, just put them in the inner zipper pocket. Big mistake. I was in the bathroom getting ready for bed when I heard her rummaging around in our bedroom. When I came out, she was literally going through all my clothes in the suitcase. She had this bright pink bikini in her hands that I bought specifically for the trip. It was kind of revealing, but like, it's a honeymoon, right? She held it up and was like, are you really planning on wearing this in public? With this disgusted look on her face, I was so embarrassed and caught off guard that I just lost it. I told her to please not go through our Private stuff because it was rude and ill mannered. That's when she got all defensive and started lecturing me about how a honeymoon doesn't mean I need to wear revealing clothes on public beaches. She kept going on about modesty and how people would stare. Then she said our relationship and honeymoon wasn't for her to comment on, but she was literally commenting on it. I was getting more and more mad because, like, we're married adults. I told her that our relationship and what I wear is none of her business. She got super offended and said I was the one with no manners, that she was just.

And honestly, watching them at the funeral was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So my brother Jake and his wife Kelly show up to our house that morning. Before we head to the church, first thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral, and she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her, but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. At the cemetery, she literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would Mention how hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I know. Now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce, pregnant lady coming through! Or, baby on board needs to pee.

I was at one of those chaotic indoor play places for my son Leo's seventh birthday party. He'd spent the entire hour at the ticket spewing Jackpot game, his face a mask of pure concentration. Finally, he hit the grand prize. A river of 1,000 tickets poured out of the machine. He was ecstatic, clutching the massive paper snake to his chest like a holy relic. That's when I saw him. A little boy, maybe five years old, pointed at Leo's tickets. I want that one. His father, a guy in an expensive tracksuit who'd been on his phone the whole time, came over. He didn't look at me, only at the tickets. Hey, my son wants those. Let him have them. I was genuinely stunned. I'm sorry, what? My son just won these. The dad let out a long breath like I was a massive inconvenience. Look, he's having a meltdown. Just give him the tickets. It's a kid's birthday party. They need to learn to share, right? I stared at him. No, he saved his tokens. All party to win this. He's not giving it away. He raised his voice loud enough for the other parents at our party table to hear. Are you serious? You're going to let your kid be selfish over a bunch of worthless paper? What kind of values are you teaching him? I could feel the blood in my cheeks. The kind of values where you don't hand over your things just because someone throws a tantrum. Now he was practically yelling, my son is having a bad day. You're raising a spoiled brat who doesn't care about other people's feelings! His son was still screaming, and now other families were starting to stare at the scene he was creating. Leo had been watching the whole thing. He looked from the screaming boy to the angry father, then down at his precious roll of ticket.

I gave them a lifetime to regret it. My 12 year old Pitbull, Lucy was losing her battle with cancer. The vet gave us the timeline, days, maybe a week. We scheduled her final appointment for Tuesday, Monday morning. I wanted to give her one perfect day. Set up a tent in the backyard, filled it with her favorite blankets, squeaky toys she used to destroy in minutes, even bought those expensive treats we used to ration. Lucy could barely walk anymore. Her breathing was labored, rattling. But when I carried her outside, her tail gave this tiny wag. She knew this was special. That's when I noticed our back neighbor, Sandra, piling sticks in their fire pit. My heart sank. Lucy's breathing was already struggling. Without smoke, I figured it wouldn't be a bother to let them know my current situation and asked if they could delay the burning just for today. The wife informed me that they're only going to burn a couple of things to tidy their yard and it won't take very long at all. And she showed me some understanding regarding the dog. After that, she started the fire and the smoke drifted into my backyard. The neighbor is directly behind my house. My backyard is roughly 100 feet by 100 feet while theirs is about 50 feet long by 100 feet wide. I don't mind if people burn stuff around me. I'm not exactly thrilled about it. But If it makes them happy, then I'm happy too. A few hours pass, I noticed they're still outside throwing more stuff onto the fire. I walk over and politely ask for an ETA, trying to remain as patient and understanding as possible. They tell me they're nearly finished. A few hours later, there is a raging fire outside and I can visibly see the husband outside pointing at my house, yelling something. Then adds more logs. No longer leaves and sticks. Right now, I'm not mad, just deeply sad the poor dog won't get the last day we hope to give her. We thought about going somewhere different but didn't want to upset her, so we're staying indoors for the rest of the day. Later that evening, around nine PM with the sun going down, I head out for a walk and see the damn fire still blazing. Like most times, no one's even there.

My daughter Emma has alopecia and lost all her hair when she was 7. She's 13 now and wears these really nice wigs that look completely natural. Most kids at school don't even know it's a wig. She. She's been dealing with this for years and has gotten pretty confident about it, but she's still sensitive when people mess with her hair. My ex husband remarried this woman, Janet, who has a 15 year old son named Kyle. Kyle's always been kind of a brat, honestly, but Janet thinks he can do no wrong. Every time we're around them, he makes these little comments about Emma's hair or asks weird questions about it. I've told my ex multiple times that Kyle needs to back off, but he just says boys will be boys, and Janet gets defensive. So last weekend was Janet's sister's wedding. Fancy outdoor thing with like 200 people. Emma was excited because she got this new wig that matched her natural hair colour perfectly, and she was wearing this really pretty blue dress. She looked amazing and was actually feeling confident for once. The ceremony was fine, but during the reception, Kyle kept hovering around Emma. I was sitting at a different table because of the whole divorced family seating situation, but I could see him bothering her. Emma kept moving away from him, but he'd follow her around.

Le reste de la famille riait maladroitement, mais personne ne l'arr√™tait. L'ann√©e derni√®re, le point de rupture avait √©t√© atteint. Grand-p√®re √©tait d√©c√©d√© 6 mois plus t√¥t, laissant derri√®re lui 1 succession colossale valant des 1.000.000. La lecture du testament avait √©t√© brutale. Tout revenait uniquement aux parents par le sang, 1 close qui excluait express√©ment les enfants adopt√©s. Le Rick avait m√™me tap√© dans la main de Jake pendant la pr√©sentation de l'avocat.

Il est temps de prouver 1 bonne fois pour toute que tu n'es pas. 1 Peterson. Toute la famille m'a regard√© me frotter la joue, Rick souriant comme s'il avait d√©j√† gagn√© 1 jeu tordu. Pendant des mois, les blagues ont empir√©. Enfin, Rick me pr√©sentait √† des gens que nous gardions chez nous par carit√© lors des barbecues familiaux. Il faisait des remarques sur le fait de savoir o√π l'on est et d'√™tre reconnaissant pour ce qu'on re√ßoit. Ma tante lui lan√ßait des regards d'avertissement, mais ne lui a jamais vraiment dit d'arr√™ter. Les r√©sultats sont arriv√©s en juillet, confirmant ce que tout le monde savait d√©j√†, j'√©tais adopt√©. Rick a fait des copies et les a apport√©s au d√Æner de famille suivant, les faisant circuler comme des cadeaux. Enfin, avait-il dit, 1 preuve scientifique de ce que nous savons tous depuis toujours. C'est l√† que j'ai commenc√© √† creuser. Si Rick voulait jouer au jeu de l'ADN, je le ferai mieux qu'il ne l'aurait jamais imagin√©.

So I'm a single mom. Been working two jobs since my daughter Bella turned five. Waitressing days, inventory at night. Bella's eighth birthday was coming up, and she had her heart set on this sparkly pink dress she saw at the thrift store downtown. Had these fake pearls all over it. Looked like something a little princess would wear. I scraped together $38 over two months to buy that dress. Every tip I didn't spend on groceries, every quarter I found in the couch cushions. When I finally had enough, we walked to that thrift store and Bella tried it on. She looked at herself in that cracked mirror and her whole face lit up. Made my heart hurt in the best way. Her birthday party was at Riverside Park. I bought dollar store balloons, made cupcakes from a box mix, and printed a Happy Birthday banner at work when my boss wasn't looking. Invited her whole class even though I knew most wouldn't show. Only four kids came, but Bella didn't care. She was spinning around in that dress like she owned the world. Then Chloe showed up with her mom, Nicole. Nicole pulls up in the shiny black Mercedes, wearing designer everything. Sunglasses that probably cost more than my rent. She takes one look at Bella and her thrift store dress and fake pearls, and I hear her whisper to another mom.

There were five of us. The first day was exactly what we needed. Hiking, swimming in the freezing lake nearby, and cooking hot dogs over an open fire. On the second evening, we were sitting around the campfire playing cards when we heard rustling from the tree line. A man emerged, maybe mid thirties, wearing hiking clothes that looked a bit too clean for someone supposedly deep in the wilderness. He introduced himself as Derek and explained he'd been hiking solo when he got lost as darkness fell. Mind if I warm up by your fire for a bit? He asked. Jason, always the friendly one, immediately offered him a beer and a spot on one of our logs. Something about Derek felt off from the start, the way his eyes darted around our campsite.

So I left him speechless in two languages. I just moved to Chicago from Romania where I'd spent two years in a tiny village learning the language. Not classroom Romanian, but the real stuff, complete with regional dialect and curse words. One day I ordered an Uber to my first job interview since moving back and saw the driver's name was Andre. I was excited to test out my Romanian. But when he pulled up looking pissed off, jaw clenched, gawling at his phone, I decided to just get in quietly like any other passenger. As soon as we started driving, he kept chatting on speaker phone like I wasn't even there. Fine. Maybe he was having a bad day. So I just settled in listening to his conversation drift between complaints about traffic and his cousin's wedding drama. Normal stuff. Then his friend asked how much longer he had to drive. Few hours. Got someone in the car now. His eyes flicked to the rearview mirror and caught mine for a second. That's when his tone shifted. God, I hate this country. The women here are so fat and ugly. That hit me like a truck. But I kept my face neutral while I stared out the window like I didn't understand. Because it turned out he was far from done. At least this one has nice tits, but why can't she lose weight? His friend Laughed. Andre kept going, gesturing with one hand while navigating traffic. Dresses nice and puts on makeup like it'll help. It's like putting lipstick on a pig. I'd heard worse in Romania because the old ladies there had no filter about weight. But this felt different, meaner. He was enjoying himself. You know what's funny? He switched lanes aggressively. These ones order Uber because they're too lazy to walk.

Our school library had the fastest Wi Fi on campus, but there was one problem. This entitled senior named Bradley who thought he owned the place. Every day during lunch, he'd set up his gaming laptop and stream Twitch while playing online games, completely destroying the internet speed for everyone else. I'm talking to megabyte download speeds when it should have been 50. Kids couldn't even load their email to check assignment updates. Bradley didn't care when people complained, he'd just laugh and say his dad donated money to build the computer lab so he had priority access. He'd sit there in his designer clothes playing games at full volume with no headphones, making it impossible for anyone else to stop. Once I was trying to submit a project that was due in 10 minutes. The file was huge and would normally upload in 30 seconds, but with Bradley streaming his Fortnite gameplay to 12 viewers, my upload kept failing. I asked him politely if he could pause his stream for two minutes so I could get it. Maybe try doing your homework at home like a normal person, he said without even looking at me. This is prime gaming time. Dude, I just need two minutes to upload this file. It's due in 10 minutes. He turned around with this smirk. Not my problem. Get better internet at home. Or maybe your parents should donate some money like Mine did. That's when I noticed his custom gaming setup had Bradley the destroyer sticker. It's all over it. This guy thought he was untouchable because his family had money. He had no idea who he was messing with. See, I'm president of the I T. Club and help manage the school's network infrastructure. Part of my job involves monitoring bandwidth usage, so I did some research on Bradley's internet habits. Turns out he was using over 80% of the library's total bandwidth. Every day during lunch, he'd been streaming, gaming and downloading massive files. But here's the beautiful part. Our network had a fair usage policy that allowed administrators to throttle users who exceed

When I was 8 years old, my older brother Jake would come to my room every school night around 9 p m. He'd sit on my bed and help me with my homework, even though he was only 12 and had his own assignments. Let's work on your math, he'd whisper quietly, making sure we didn't wake our parents. He'd help me with addition problems, read with me, and check my spelling words. It became our special routine. What I loved most was that Jake never made me feel stupid when I got answers wrong. He was patient and kind, always encouraging me to try again. Sometimes we'd work until really late, way past my bedtime. But I didn't mind because I felt so smart. With his help, my grades started getting better. My teacher would praise my homework and tell me how proud she was of my improvement. I felt so good about school for the first time. But there was something strange about our study sessions. Jake always seemed really worried and kept checking the clock. If we heard footsteps in the hallway, he'd quickly turn off my light and pretend we were sleeping. Why do we have to be so quiet? I'd ask him. Because mom and dad need their rest, he'd say. This is our secret homework time. I thought it was fun having a secret with my big brother. Jake Made learning feel special and important, like we were doing something really cool together. This went on for the entire school year. Every single night, Jake would help me with my work. My grades went from DS and FS to A's and b's. I was so proud and couldn't wait to show my parents my report card. But when I brought home my first A plus on a math test, my parents barely looked at it. They just grunted and went back to watching TV. I was confused because I thought they'd be excited. Years later, when I was in high school, I was telling Jake how grateful I was for all those nights he helped me with homework. I probably would have failed third grade without you. I said, you were such a good brother for doing that. Jake got really quiet and looked uncomfortable. You don't understand, he said. I wasn't.

I spent three years with Kayla and figured she was the one. She wasn't flashy or dramatic like my ex girlfriend's. She was calm, kind of shy, and hated any kind of public attention. That's what I loved about her. She'd get embarrassed if I even held her hand in front of people. So when I decided to propose, I made it super low key. No big restaurant scene or flash mob or anything crazy like that. Just a picnic by the lake where we had our first date. Brought sandwiches, some wine, the simple ring I'd saved up for months to buy. No photographers, no family hiding in the bushes. Just us. I got down on one knee right as the sun was setting. My hands were shaking so bad, I almost dropped the ring. But I managed to get the words out. She looked shocked for a second, then started crying happy tears. I thought she said yes. Quiet and soft, like everything else about her. But definitely yes. We went home that night, and she cooked dinner like nothing had happened. We watched some Netflix show. She even wore the ring to bed. I kept staring at it on her finger, thinking how lucky I was. The next morning, I woke up alone. That wasn't weird, since she always got up early for work. But when I went to brush my teeth, her toothbrush was gone. I opened her Dresser drawer empty. The closet, half the hangers were bare. Even her Netflix account was signed out of our TV. I thought maybe there was some family emergency. Called her phone, straight to voicemail. Texted her like twenty times. Drove to the clinic where she worked as a receptionist. Her coworker Amy said she'd called in sick. But Amy looked weird when she said it, like she was lying for three days. I was going crazy. Called her mom, her sister. Even drove by her old apartment.

I arrived at the hotel early with my new stepmother, something blue, planning to surprise her before the ceremony. We've been close ever since she and my dad got together, and she even picked me to be her maid of honor instead of her own daughter, Rafaela, who I'd never actually met. But when she walked in, I recognized her right away, ratty extensions and fake tan and all. I'd lost 60 pounds since the last family. My photo my dad had shared, and my hair was now blonde instead of brunette, she didn't realize I was the girl who was about to be her new sister. Excuse me. What the hell are you doing in here? She demanded, looking me up and down with disgust. This. This is a private bridal suite for family and invited guests only. How did you even get past security? Before I could explain, she called out, girls, we have a problem. Some random woman broke into the suite. I tried to say, I'm. But she cut me off immediately. And honestly, part of me wanted to see what kind of person my new stepsister really was before she knew who I was. Oh, my god, look at your dress, Rafael said, circling me like a predator. Did you get that at goodwill? It's so pathetic when poor people try to sneak into Nice events. You probably saw the wedding announcement online and thought you could pretend to belong here. Two other bridesmaids came in, and she announced. Look at this tragic woman trying to blend in with that awful dress and those payless shoes. It's

Two years ago, a neighbor's dog broke its chain and went after her. King jumped between them. The other dog bit king's shoulder and neck bad. But he didn't stop protecting Lizzie until hell came. She lived because of him. But the attack hurt her spine. She can't walk anymore. Last month we found a doctor who does a special surgery. Growth plate surgery. It could help her walk again. Really walk. But it only works while kids bones are still growing. Lizzie turns 14 in three months. After for that, her growth plates close and it's too late forever. The surgery costs $15,000. Insurance says no, won't pay anything. The vets waiting for an answer about king. My hands won't stop shaking. I'm looking at this dog who saved my daughter's life, who still has scars on his Neck from protecting her. Now he's dying, and I have exactly enough money to save him. Or exactly enough money to help my daughter walk. Not both. The vet says quality of life, but all I hear is, choose between the one who saved her and save in her future. Lizzie's at school right now in her wheelchair. She carries around a picture of king to show anyone she meets and calls him my hero. She doesn't know we're here at the vet. Doesn't know I'm choosing between her legs and his life. The vet's still waiting. I call three other vets from the parking lot. Same price for king surgery. I try to apply for care credit, but I'm denied. My credit score was destroyed from medical bills after Lizzie's attack. I start a gofundme, but after

When I tried to pay her back, she just smiled and said, welcome to Sweden. I finished my shopping in a days. The total came to what my dad used to make in three months. Back home, the cashier was probably wondering why I kept staring at the receipt. That night, I called my family using the Anderson's phone. I tried telling my mom about the supermarket, but I couldn't find the words. How do you explain abundance to someone who's never seen it? How do you describe a candy aisle to someone who considers sugar a luxury? Three months later, I got a job at that same I c. A. Every day I watched people casually throw things in their carts without checking prices. Kids whining because their parents wouldn't buy them their fourth type of cereal. It should have made me angry, but instead it just reminded me how different worlds can exist in the same planet. After six months, I started doing the same thing, grabbing items without checking prices, walking past the candy aisle without thinking twice. I had become what I once couldn't understand. But I never stopped buying those gummy bears. Every week I'd get a small bag and mail them to Layla. It took three weeks for each package to reach Syria and half the candy usual.

Marcus stepped out wearing a designer suit, Rolex gleaming. He'd aged badly, the look of someone who'd partied away eight years. Hey, little brother, he said casually. Is dad around? I want to explain everything. Made it big in crypto. Can pay him back with interest. Dad's at Riverside Cemetery, I said flatly. Plot 47B. Been there 14 months. The color drained from his face. When? How? Waiting, I said. He died waiting for you. Set your place at dinner every Sunday for eight years. Forgave you. Before his last breath, Marcus pulled out a check. $1 million. See? I told you I'd make it someday. You built it on his corpse. I said that money was his life's work. You didn't steal money, Marcus. You stole his remaining years. He died a Walmart greeter because of you. Marcus tried pushing past me. This is still his place. It's a coffee shop now. Everything of Dad's is gone. You missed the decline, the pain, the end. You missed your chance to let him die in peace. Instead of wondering what he did wrong as a father, Marcus stood there in his expensive suit, holding his worthless check, finally understanding what his absence had cost. Not money, but the Chance to make peace with the man who loved him by everything. He drove away without visiting the cemetery. Sometimes the cruelest abandonment isn't leaving. It's staying away while someone waits for you to return. Keeping hope alive until their very last breath.

He came back last month, expecting forgiveness. He found out dad died waiting for an apology. The security camera caught everything.

I need this more than you do. Don't look for me. The betrayal destroyed something in dad. He had to sell the shop at a loss, move into a one bedroom apartment, and take a job as a Walmart greeter at 71. But watching his golden child become a thief, that killed his spirit. Move back from Denver to help. But every Sunday dinner, dad set Marcus's place at the table. Maybe today, he'd say the empty chair mocked us both. Year one, dad refused to press charges. He's still my son. Year two, he hired a private investigator. The trail went cold in Phoenix. Year 3 brought Dad's first heart attack. In the hospital, he made me promise to tell Marcus he was forgiven. I just want to know why. What did I do wrong raising him? Dad's health declined steadily. Diabetes? Any problems? Another stroke? Sometimes he'd mistake me for Marcus, grab my hand and say, you came back. The hope in his eyes when reality hit was unbearable. Year 7, Dad moved into the hospital. Even on morphine. He'd ask nurses if his son had called. I'd lie and say Marcus was coming. Dad would smile peacefully. He died on a Tuesday morning, still waiting. His last words were about Marcus. Tell him the combination was his birthday. He didn't need to steal.

Took him maybe 30 seconds, and he didn't even seem to try hard. The cops started digging into Derek's background. Turns out he had access to way more than people realized. Every security system he installed came with admin codes that let him disarm everything remotely. And as a locksmith, he was making copies of every key and access code he touched. Here's how smart this guy was. He never hit houses right after working on them. He'd wait months, sometimes half a year, long enough for people to forget he'd ever been there. He'd watch people's social media, figure out when they were going on vacation, then strike when the house was empty. The genius part was combining both jobs. The security systems told him which houses had expensive stuff worth stealing. The locksmith work gave him a way to get in without leaving any trace. And since he installed the security systems himself, he knew exactly how to disable them. They finally caught him because the Chen family had installed a second set of cameras in their baby's room that Derek didn't know about. These were connected to a different system entirely. When he broke in, those cameras caught his face clear as day. When police searched Derek's house, they found a storage unit full of stolen goods and this thick

No contact with family. My sister Tara got a German Shepherd for her 16th birthday. I got a card. The dog's name was Jack's and he cost $3,000 from a champion bloodline. My parents built him a heated dog house that cost more than my car. When Jax bit me the first week, dad said I must have bothered him. Jax killed my childhood cat, peaches, three months later. I'd raised peaches from a kitten bottle, fed her when she was abandoned. I found her lifeless in the backyard one morning. My parents shrugged and said cats were boring anyway, that dogs had personality. They refused to let me bury her properly because it might upset Jax to smell another animal in his yard. I buried peaches at my friend's house and cried alone. I paid for my own college, working three jobs. Sarah dropped out sophomore year to become a dog trainer. She'd never trained Jax to even sit yet. My parents bought her a 40 thousand dollar mobile grooming van for her new career. The business lasted two months. I graduated nursing school with honours. My parents couldn't make it to graduation. Jack's had a vet appointment when Tara's dog turned one. They threw a party with 50 guests. Then Jack's attacked my neighbour's poodle. My parents paid the vet bills and bought Tara a second German Shepherd to keep Jack's company. When I asked for help with my textbooks, mom said, that's My responsibility. The second dog's name was Athena. She was worse than Jack's. Together, they destroyed my childhood bedroom. During Thanksgiving, I found peaches hidden toys under my bed torn to shreds. My parents laughed and said, dogs will be dogs. Everything unraveled when I met Steven. We dated two years before getting engaged. My parents said they were thrilled, but never asked about wedding plans. When I mentioned wedding costs, they suggested courthouse ceremonies were more intimate. At the same time, Tara announced Jack's needed surgery for hip dysplasia. My parents spent $15,000 without blinking. Then Jack's destroyed my wedding dress.

Ryan, maybe don't come home this year. Jessica's bringing her boyfriend. He's a manager, someone important. And your job, it isn't very comfortable to talk about. So it's best if you don't come. What the hell did you just say? You coming home would embarrass the whole family. If you insist on coming, don't call me your father. Then he hung up. I sat there, hands shaking, his words echoing in my head. The same people living off my 400 dollar monthly payments were calling me the family shame. I opened my banking app and stared at That No.. Nine thousand hundred forty two, 17. I scrolled to automatic payments and canceled every single one. Electricity, water, internet. All of it. A week later, my mother texted. Internet Bill is due. Can you take care of it? No mention of what happened, no apology. Just a request to pay. I didn't respond. Two weeks later, my father left a sharp voicemail. Power company called. This month's Bill hasn't been paid. What's going on? Still no acknowledgement. I remained silent until my mother's birthday that afternoon.

They'll be here after you. I packed my bags that night without another word. When she and her squad showed up at my new place days later. She? I'd been with Marissa for over two years. We'd moved in together six months earlier. Split everything down the middle, the whole domestic thing. But lately, I felt like I was dating five people instead of one. Marissa had this tight knit friend group. Chloe, Adrian, Tasha, and Finn, who called themselves the squad. Ironically, they did literally everything together, 24 seven. Group chats, matching Halloween costumes, coordinated social media posts. First I thought it was sweet. Eventually, I started wondering if I was even in a relationship or just some guy who paid half the rent. The pattern had been building for months. My graduation from my master's program. She went to Adrian's housewarming instead. My brother's wedding. She was too exhausted from a three day festival with the squad. When my mom was in the hospital for surgery, Marissa couldn't visit because it conflicted with their weekly game night. But she expected me to drop everything for her needs. Last month, she called me at 2:00am to pick her up from some dive bar because Finn was too drunk to drive. When I got there, she barely acknowledged me. Just kept taking selfies while I stood there like an Uber driver. The worst part was overhearing her phone conversations. I heard Her tell Tasha I was going through a jealous phase and needed to learn to share her time better. Like I was some insecure teenager instead of her partner. The breaking point came with our two year anniversary. I'd planned

I only found the first camera because I dropped a fork. It slipped under the kitchen cabinet, and when I bent down to grab it, I saw a tiny black dot blinking behind the molding. I stared at it for five seconds straight before it hit me. It was pointed directly at my couch, where I usually nap, sometimes shirtless. I unscrewed the panel and pulled out the camera. It was wireless. Micro lens. No brand. Not something you find at Walmart. I didn't freak out. I got quiet. I live in an old triplex, third floor. My landlord, Dave, lives on the bottom floor. Looks like a guy who eats plain boiled chicken and still sweats. You know the type. Too friendly. Always around, just fixing stuff. No one asked him to. A few weeks before, I caught him in the hallway, just standing there saying he thought he heard a leak. I thought he was just awkward. Turns out he was waiting for me to take my shirt off. So I started searching the apartment. Found a second cam inside the smoke detector above my bed, a third one behind a vent in the bathroom. This man had basically installed a live streaming network of my body without my consent. That's when I stopped being scared and started producing content. I left the cameras exactly where they were, but I changed the script every Morning. I'd start with a routine. I'd stand directly under the camera in the bathroom and talk to it like it was Alexa. Good morning, Dave. Hope you're enjoying the view. Can't wait for you to see the surprise later. Then came the props. I filled my fridge with fake IDS, rubber gloves and syringes filled with dyed water. Took hours to make everything look real. I'd sit on the couch under the kitchen cam, holding a fake burner phone, saying stuff like, yeah, the body's still in the tub, but the acids working slowly. Sometimes I just stare straight into the camera for 30 minutes. No blinking, no moving, just wide eyed, like I was watching him. By week two, I noticed changes. Dave stopped coming upstairs.

J'ai encadr√© mon dipl√¥me, je me suis investie dans le travail, j'ai obtenu 1 promotion. J'ai emm√©nag√© dans 1 nouvel appartement baign√© de lumi√®re. J'ai nou√© des Amiti√©s avec des gens qui m'ont vu 1 jour. Ils ont enfin appel√© Ryan, ta femme famille a besoin de toi. Il est temps de tourner la page.

La m√™me famille qui m'a fait trater ma remise de dipl√¥me m'a dit que je te devais des excuses alors que j'√©tais assis seul le jour le plus important de ma vie. C'est dr√¥le, dis-je avec 1 sourire glacial. Parce que je me suis sacrifi√© pendant des ann√©es et que je n'ai obtenu que le silence. Maintenant, l'enfant ch√©ri ne brille plus.

My neighbour's dog kept getting into our yard, destroying my wife's garden. She'd spent months growing those flowers after her cancer treatment. It was her therapy, her way of healing from the hell she'd endured. I asked him nicely the first time, he shrugged it off with a dismissive smirk. Second time, he rolled his eyes like I was bothering him. Third time, he told. Told me to build a better fence if you don't like it. By the fifth conversation, he was laughing in my face, saying, dogs will be dogs. Deal with it or move. The final straw came on a Tuesday morning. I found my wife Rachel sitting in the dirt, crying over her destroyed rose bushes. The special hybrid ones she'd planted to celebrate eating stage 3 breast cancer. Six months of careful nurturing, daily watering, protective covers during storms. Gone. Petals scattered everywhere like bloody confetti. She looked up at me with tears streaming and whispered, why would someone let this happen to us? Haven't we been through enough? That's when something dark lit inside me. A switch flipped that I didn't know existed. I spent that entire night researching everything about Brian Miller and that stupid German Shepherd. Social media profiles, property records, business licenses. Turns out the mutt wasn't even registered with the city. No vaccination records, no license, nothing.

He just sips the cup the barista fills for him every morning and writes in this battered leather notebook that looks like it's been to war. We never asked what he writes. Maybe poetry, maybe unsent letters. Doesn't matter. Joe's just part of the morning rhythm, like the squeaky doorbell or the hum of the espresso machine. And then one day, that rhythm got broken. A guy stepped out of a great Tesla, all fake tan and too much Cologne, talking into his phone like it was a mic, designer joggers, those chunky sneakers that cost more than my rent, and sunglasses he never took off. Even inside, he ordered something that wasn't on the menu. A keto friendly cold pressed oat milk frappe with collagen boost, and smiled like he just invented coffee. The barista handed him an iced cold brew with almond milk instead. He rolled his eyes, said, ugh, small towns, and paid in crumpled cash while filming himself complaining about it. He sat by the window with his tripod, adjusted the lighting, and started talking to his phone loud enough for The entire cafe to hear, this town's cute, but it's, like, poor cute.

He didn't look up from his laptop when I carried the bridge into the kitchen. Too many support beams, he muttered. It'll sag under pressure. It didn't. I won first place. I brought home the ribbon and taped it to the fridge. The next morning, it was gone. Mom said she thought it looked messy and put it in the drawer. I never asked her which one, but I kept trying.

It was like feeding coins into a machine that never paid out. In college, I landed a summer internship with a well known civil firm. I printed the offer letter and left it on his desk.

I work nights at the library, I eat cold ramen more than I'd like to admit. But I keep to myself, study, shower when no one's around, and do everything I can not to cause problems. Which is why I was confused when the housing office emailed me about a third noise complaint. Something about yelling stop something! And aggressive energy. I live with one person. Trip. That's his real name. And if it sounds like the name of someone who owns a drone and two vape pens, that's because it is. Trip is everything I'm not. Loud, messy, rich, and allergic to consequences. I knocked on his door after the first complaint. He said, bro, I don't care. It's probably just some nerd trying to get us kicked. Okay. Second complaint came after a broken window. Not mine, not my fault. But my name was somehow on the report. So when the third one came, I realized this wasn't a misunderstanding. It was war. And I couldn't afford to lose. If I got booted from housing, I was out of school, period. No dorm, no commute, no backup. So I did what broke kids do best. I got creative. I had an old phone with a decent camera.

I thought she meant a long weekend, maybe a week at most. The first month, she'd text asking how he was doing, but the messages got shorter and less frequent. By month three, I was the one initiating contact. By month six, she'd go weeks without responding to photos I'd send. I started keeping records without really planning to. Screenshots of ignored texts, photos of Owen reaching milestones she missed, bank statements showing I was paying for everything from formula to doctor visits. The family made excuses for her. She was finding herself. She was going through a phase. She needed space to heal. Meanwhile, I was learning to function on three hours of sleep, trading my social life for story time and watching my savings disappear into baby expenses. Owen's first word was Mama, looking right at me. His first steps were toward my outstretched arms. When he got sick with his first fever, I was the one pacing the hallway at 3 a m, checking his temperature every hour. Jess missed his first birthday entirely. He promised to come, but canceled last minute because her friend was having a crisis that turned out to be a bad breakup. I sang Happy Birthday to him alone, watching him smash cake into his high chair while trying not to cry. That was 18 months ago. I've been documenting everything. The missed visits, the forgotten birthday, the child support she never sent. Owen called me Mama! And didn't even recognize her voice on the phone. Then Jess landed a marketing job at her boyfriend's startup and suddenly wanted to play Mommy again. She filed for custody, claiming I'd kidnapped her son and she was ready to be a real parent now. Her lawyer painted me as the unstable single woman who'd stolen a baby during a mother's vulnerable moment. That's when I pulled out my phone and played the voicemail she'd left me just last month, completely drunk, laughing about how she'd dodged a bullet by dumping Owen on me and how she'd never wanted kids anyway. The judge's face said everything just went pale as her lawyer frantically tried to object.

I didn't hold back in court. My cousin Jess was the family princess who could do no wrong. While I worked two jobs through college, she partied her way through a communications degree our aunt paid for. When I graduated with honors, the family dinner conversation was about Jess's new tattoo. When I got my first apartment, they were helping her out of another DUI. The golden child treatment only got worse as we got older. Jess would blow through jobs like tissues, always landing on her feet because someone in the family would make a phone call. She'd crash cars and get new ones. She'd max out credit cards, and somehow the debt would just disappear. When she got pregnant at 22, she acted like it was just an inconvenience. She'd show up at family dinners complaining about morning sickness while chain smoking on the porch. At her baby shower, she spent more time taking selfies with the gifts than actually opening them. I watched her roll her eyes when people gave practical things like diapers and bottles. The pregnancy was rough, but not because of medical issues. I just hated how it cramped her style. She'd call me at midnight crying about how her body was ruined, how her friends were having fun without her, how she felt trapped. I thought it was normal pregnancy anxiety. After baby Owen was born, Jess lasted Exactly three weeks before she cracked. Those three weeks were a disaster. She'd let him cry for hours because she was too tired to get. She forgot to buy formula twice, leaving me scrambling to the store at 2:00am. I'd find dirty diapers stuffed behind furniture because she couldn't be bothered to walk to the trash. The breaking point came when I stopped by unannounced and found Owen screaming in his crib, completely alone. Jess was at a nail appointment she'd forgotten to mention. The baby was soaked, hungry, and had been crying so long his voice was hoarse. She called me that night crying, saying she couldn't handle it anymore and needed just a few days to figure things out. She showed up at my door with a diaper bag half packed with random clothes.

Weird rash, probably from sweating too much. Lose weight. So when I started getting these crazy chest pains, I already knew what was coming. But these weren't like normal chest pain.

I went to the ER on a Tuesday night around nine PM. The place was packed. But when you say chest pain, they usually take you back pretty quick. The attending doctor was this middle aged guy who walked in, took one look at me, and I could literally see him making assumptions. He poked my stomach a few times, asked how much I exercised, and said the pain was probably just acid reflux or anxiety from stress eating. I tried to explain that it didn't feel like heartburn at all. This was different. But he was already writing something on his clipboard. He handed me a prescription for antacids and told me to cut back on spicy foods and maybe try Yoga for stress. I didn't even bother filling the prescription. What was the point? They never listen anyway. My roommate Katie was pissed when I told her what happened. She'd been dealing with the same kind of medical bias for years.

My husband came home from work last Tuesday with this look on his face that I knew meant trouble. He'd been on the phone with his ex wife all afternoon about Caleb. His 24 year old son. Caleb had overdosed again. Fourth time this year. And this time they found him passed out in some gas station bathroom with a needle still hanging out of his arm. I was making dinner when my husband sat down at the kitchen table and just stared at me. My daughter Emma was upstairs doing homework. Completely unaware of what was about to happen. He cleared his throat and said they needed $30,000 for an impatient rehab program. 60 days. Some fancy place up in the mountains that supposedly had better success rates. I stopped stirring the pasta sauce and turned around $30,000. We'd already blown through almost $14,000 on outpatient programs that didn't work because Caleb either didn't show up or relapsed the second he got out. I'd personally paid a thousand bucks for his first detox thing. Maybe this time would be different. Then my husband paid 6,005 hundred for another program. Then we split another sixty five hundred when Caleb swore on his dead grandmother's grave that he was ready to get clean. But here's the thing about Caleb. He stolen my wedding ring, my mother's jewelry, our TV, Emma's laptop. And even loose change from Emma's piggy bank. The Kid had no problem looking a 15 year old girl in the eye and taking her birthday money. And every time it was the same story. He was sorry. He was gonna change. He just needed one more chance. So when my husband said they wanted to use Emma's college fund, I actually laughed. Not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe he was serious. That money came from Emma's dad, who died when she was six.

La journaliste s'est approch√©e de moi. qu'est-ce qui a inspir√© ce don incroyable √† la communaut√© ? J'ai regard√© droit dans les yeux la cam√©ra, puis mes parents. Ma grand-m√®re disait toujours que l'argent r√©v√®le le caract√®re. Elle a laiss√© se foncer du sien pour voir ce qu'on en ferait. Le visage de mon p√®re. Palli. Que veux-tu dire ? J'ai souri en sortant mon t√©l√©phone. Et aussi, elle a aussi laiss√© 1 lettre √† son avocat. Dois-je la lire ? La foule se rapprocha tandis que j'ouvrais l'email que je gardais pour ce moment. Si mon petit-fils Chris utilise son h√©ritage pour aider les autres, il recevra le v√©ritable h√©ritage, les biens immobiliers familiaux d'une valeur de 15.000.000 de dollars. S'il est √©go√Øste, il ira √† 1 ≈ìuvre caritative. Anna resta bouche b√©e. Tes biens immobiliers commerciaux ? Quels biens immobiliers commerciaux ? Ce dont grand-m√®re ne t'a jamais parl√© ? Dis l'empire locatif qu'elle a b√¢ti, les propri√©t√©s que tu pensais n'√™tre que de vieux b√¢timents. Mes parents avaient l'air √©c≈ìur√©. On pensait t'apprendre √†. √ätre responsable en donnant l'argent √† Anna. Et c'est vrai, tu m'as appris que ce n'est pas le sang qui fait la famille, c'est le caract√®re qui fait la famille. L'avocat s'avan√ßa avec des documents, Chris, f√©licitations, √† ce jour, tu poss√®des 17 locaux commerciaux √† travers la ville. Anna s'est mise √† pleurer, ce n'est pas juste. J'ai des enfants √† nourrir et maintenant ils auront 1 centre communautaire ou grandir. Et je dis gr√¢ce au fond fiduciaire que tu pensais recevoir le meilleur dans tout ce. La publication virale sur Facebook a rapport√© $50.000 de dons suppl√©mentaires la 1√®re semaine. Mes parents ont pass√© des mois √† essayer de se refaire 1 r√©putation. Anna a d√ª trouver son 1√®re vrai travail √† 34 ans, et moi, j'ai continu√© √† me faire tatouer, √† g√©rer mon centre communautaire et √† g√©rer mon nouvel empire immobilier. Il s'av√®re que grand-m√®re savait exactement ce qu'elle faisait. Le dernier SMS que j'ai re√ßu Dana, date de 3 mois plus tard. Je te d√©teste, j'ai r√©pondu, je sais, mes 200 enfants de ce quartier adorent ce que nous avons construit ensemble. Mes parents ont fini par c√©der, surtout en voyant leur nom sur le mur des donateurs que j'avais ajout√©. Parce que parfois, la meilleure vengeance n'est pas de rendre l'appareil, c'est de leur prouver qu'ils ont tort tout en rendant le monde meilleur.

I watched Dylan Mercer rule our school for three years. He was untouchable. Wealthy parents who donated to the school, perfect grades, captain of the debate team. And that smile that charmed every teacher. But behind closed doors, he was a monster. I first noticed it sophomore year when my friend Ava came to school with puffy eyes. It's nothing, she insisted, but later confessed. Dylan had spread rumors that she'd slept with the entire baseball team after she rejected him at a party. Why don't you report him? I asked. Are you kidding? His mom is on the school board. Besides, everyone loves him. Her voice cracked. No one would believe me. She was right. Dylan operated in plain sight. He'd trip kids in the hallway, but make it look accidental. He'd borrow answers, then accuse others of cheating. The teachers never suspected a thing. By junior year, I started documenting everything. Small notes in my phone at first. Dates, times, incidents. Then I began recording conversations when he was nearby. It wasn't much, but it was something. The breaking point came during senior year. My best friend Marcus transferred to our school, and Dylan immediately targeted him. It started with harmless jokes about Marcus being gay. Then his gym clothes mysteriously disappeared during PE, his art projects were accidentally damaged. Just ignore him, I suggested. But Marcus's eyes darkened. That's what everyone says. That's why bullies win. One Monday, Marcus didn't show up to school. Then Tuesday. By Wednesday, his mom called me crying. He tried to harm him.

Les filles pleurent sur son √©paule, lui confiennent leurs secrets les plus sombres et elle consid√©rait leur protection comme le but de sa vie. Les vacances diverses sont pass√©es et hi√©e est arriv√©e avec des √©couteurs, les yeux riv√©s sur son t√©l√©phone, ignorant compl√®tement le cercle de fille qui attendait pour lui raconter leur histoire.

Even statistics seemed interesting with the right teacher. I was sitting on a bench outside the library, feeling like my life was finally beginning when they called. My mom's voice was oddly cheerful for someone destroying my future. We need you to listen carefully, honey. We can't pay for school anymore. What happened to the college savings account you've had for me since I was a baby? My voice cracked. They'd shown me the statements every birthday. Watch the numbers grow. Used it as motivation when I didn't want to study for the S A T S. That money was supposed to be sacred, untouchable. Mine. There was a pause before my dad cleared his throat. I had some problems. We're going to need all the money back to pay some debts. Which was weird because she didn't say what kind of debts. Then what am I supposed to do? I felt like I might throw up. My mom jumped back in with her solution. You need to find a rich boyfriend by the end of the month. You go to school with plenty of wealthy students. And you have a good body, so it wouldn't be impossible for you to get a boyfriend to turn into a husband. I sat there stunned while she kept talking. She explained their whole plan like she thought it through carefully. How I should target guys in the business school. How I should dress more revealing. How I should laugh at their jokes even if they weren't funny. If you just don't break up with him, even if he cheats on you, then in seven years you can go back to school again.

My parents believed that inheritance money destroyed young people. After my grandmother left me $50,000 when I was 15, they put it in a trust I couldn't touch until 30. Every teenager who gets early money becomes a burnout, mom would preach. They buy cars, party, drop out. We're protecting you from yourself. They made me sign papers. Everything away. Made me live like the money didn't exist. At 17, I worked at subway for minimum wage while 50 grand sat in an account I couldn't touch. My friends thought I was crazy. Just petition the court, they'd say. But fighting my parents meant lawyers, family drama, maybe losing the money entirely, and legal fees. That's when I discovered dropshipping. Started with $50 from my subway check. Buying phone cases from China, reselling them online. First month, I made $200. Second in a month, $800. By senior year of high school, I was clearing $5,000 monthly. While my parents thought I was studying in my room, I got creative with hiding it. Opened accounts at three different banks using my work address. Had packages delivered to my friend Sarah's house. Kept cash and tampon boxes inside, old textbooks behind picture frames. My room looked like a normal teenagers, but it held $30,000 in various hiding spots. Why do you need new shoes? Mom would ask. Those still have souls. The subway job doesn't pay enough for extras, dad would add. Budget better. Meanwhile, I had enough to buy a car. Cash. But I kept taking the bus, kept wearing thrift store clothes, kept the act. Everything changed the week before graduation. I came home early from school with a headache. Mom's car was in the driveway, but Dad's was gone. Normal for 2 p m. But when I walked in, mom was at the kitchen table with papers everywhere. Crying mom. She tried to hide the papers, but I saw the header. Second notice. Medical debt collection. It's nothing, she said, shoving them in a drawer. That night, I went.

They paid me 45 k while my cousins made 80 k doing basic office work. Let me paint you the full picture here. When I started, Dad's company was still using paper filing cabinets and Excel spreadsheets. From 2015, they had invoices getting lost, double full booked equipment, and clients calling constantly asking for project updates that nobody could find. I spent six months building them a custom system from scratch. Client portal where customers could track their projects in real time. Automated scheduling that prevented equipment conflicts, digital invoicing that cut payment delays from 45 days to 12 days. Even built them an app where Foreman could upload progress photos directly to client accounts. The transformation was insane. Revenue jumped from 800K to $2.3 million in 18 months. Dad kept bragging to other contractors about his high tech operation, never mentioning who actually built it. But here's where it gets interesting. My cousins Damon and Silas, who barely graduated high school, were suddenly project coordinators making serious money. Damon's main job was driving to job sites and taking pictures I had to upload for him because he couldn't figure out the system. Silas spent most days playing games on his phone while I handled actual emergencies. And there's Dad's new wife, Marlene married him eight months ago and immediately started inserting herself into the business. Made herself operations manager despite never working construction a day in her life. Started suggesting we modernize by switching to cheaper software solutions she found on Google every time I tried explaining why our custom system

Plain Jane with my practical clothes and boring haircut. Larry used to love that about me. I was beautiful just as I was. But once he got all fancy, suddenly I wasn't good enough anymore. He started having affairs with these gorgeous women from his law firm. When I begged him to go to counseling, you know what he told me? That the problem was my big nose and my mommy pooch from having kids. Like those were things I could just fix with a makeover or something. I was literally packing divorce papers when our daughter Carla got hit by a car while riding her bike. He survived, but needed years of surgeries and rehab. So Larry and I agreed to stay together for the kids, keep things civil. He kept cheating the whole time, but by then, I was done caring about his Faithfulness. I just wanted to get Carla better. We finally divorced after both kids went off to college. Larry immediately married some 33 year old from his office. Meanwhile, I'm alone for the first time in decades. That's when I decided to actually focus on myself for once. Coloured my hair this nice Auburn shade. Lost about 15 pounds at the gym. Bought clothes that actually fit instead of hiding under baggy sweaters. Started going to singles events. Went on actual dates for the first time in years. Nothing crazy. Just normal stuff people do when they're single.

So Thursday, my ex wife texts me about this family BBQ at her stepdad's place for the weekend. She's like, bring some food. It'll be fun just hanging out on the patio. I figured, why not? Me and my girlfriend Emma could use a chill afternoon. I spent two hours making this bomb pasta salad and potato salad from scratch, plus bought some good sausages from the butcher shop. Saturday comes, and it's gorgeous outside. I'm wearing my nice khaki shorts, white polo, and these canvas shoes I just got. Emma's in this cute sundress and sandals. We show up with all the food, thinking we're about to have drinks and maybe play some cards on the patio. The second we walk in, my ex wife's stepdad, Gary comes over with this weird grin. Great timing. We need to get some work done before we eat. I'm like, what? He points to the back patio, which is covered in dog crap from their three labs. Then he's gesturing to this overgrown section of the yard. Need to clear all that brush and weed so I can put my new greenhouse there next week. I looked down at my outfit, then at Emma, who's basically dressed for a garden party, not actual gardening. Uh, Gary, we weren't really planning on doing yard work today. We brought food and figured we'd just hang out. The whole vibe instantly shifted. My Ex wife rolls her eyes and goes typical under her breath. Gary's face gets all red and he's like, well, if you're not helping, what's the point of being here? Some cousin I barely know chimes in with everyone else is working. Why should you be special?

I was out at the sports bar with my now ex, Eric and his friends last month. Eric and his buddy Mark were being typical drunk idiots, making jokes about how Mark was demolishing an entire plate of nachos like he hadn't eaten in days. Eric laughed and said something like, dude, slow down before you eat the whole damn place. That's when Mark looked straight at me with this weird smirk and said, if only she knew. The entire table went dead silent, like you could hear the ice clinking in glasses across the room. I had no clue what the hell Mark was talking about, but my stomach dropped immediately. You know that feeling when you walk into a room and everyone stops talking? That's exactly what this was. Before I could even ask what he meant, Eric completely lost his mind. He started screaming at Mark to shut the fuck up, calling him every name in the book. He actually tried to lunge across the table at him, but their other friends, Jake and Chris, had to physically hold him back. Mark just sat there smiling like nothing happened, which made Eric even more pissed. The whole bar was staring at us. Eric was still yelling, his face bright red, veins popping out of his neck. I grabbed his arm and told him we needed to leave now. On the drive back to my apartment, I kept asking him what Mark meant Eric just gripped the steering wheel tighter and told me to drop it, but I couldn't. That comment was eating at me, and Eric's reaction made it 10 times worse. When we got to my place, I tried again. Eric, what did Mark mean by if only she knew? What don't I know? He exploded, started pacing around my living room, running his hands through his hair, telling me I was being paranoid and crazy. Every time I asked a simple question, he'd dodge it and get angrier.

He's sweating so bad it's dripping on our test papers, and he keeps checking his phone every few seconds. I look for our teacher, but she left to make copies 10 minutes ago and never came back. The man doesn't even say his name, just stares at all of us, breathing heavily, and then asks really loud, whose parents work in the downtown offices? You know, the big buildings. Nobody raises their hand because we all know about stranger danger, and this guy seems dangerous. He gets mad, and his face goes from red to almost purple. He yells, I know some of you have parents there. This is important! Finally, me and four other kids slowly raise our hands because maybe something happened to our parents and he needs to tell us. He points at us and says, you five stay after the bell rings. Everyone else, leave as fast as you can. The girl next to me grabs my wrist and whispers, run with me. But my legs won't move. What if my mom needs me, and this man is supposed to take me to her? The bell rings, and everyone practically runs out like the rooms on fire. The man locks the door behind them with this loud click, and my stomach drops like on a roller coaster. He won't even let us near our backpacks where our phones are. The quiet Girl starts crying, and he doesn't even care. Just keeps checking the window. Then his watch saying 15 minutes. We wait 15 minutes, which makes no sense because our parents usually pick us up in five minutes. The classroom phone rings, and he rips it from the wall. Like, actually rips it out and throws it in the trash. And now I'm really scared, because why would he do that unless he's kidnapping us? We hear sirens outside. Lots of them, getting louder. He stands in front of the door, blocking it with his.

After that, I would pass a law that says if you're under 18, you get a basic meal free at places like chick fil A and McDonald's. Why? Teens are bottomless pits with broke wallets and fries.

But she started shaking when she realized what she had done. We were supposed to leave for Italy The next morning. My husband's whole family was going. Parents, siblings, everyone. This was supposed to be our dream vacation to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. I was so excited since I've never been to Europe before. But my mother in law, Valerie, has always absolutely hated me. From day one, she's made it crystal clear that she thinks I'm not good enough for her precious. She's made my life hell for the past three years with constant passive aggressive comments and deliberate exclusions from family events. The worst part? My husband just stands there and lets it happen. He never defends me, never calls her out. It's like he's terrified of mommy dearest. For weeks leading up to this trip, Valerie had been making little comments. Oh, I hope everyone's paperwork is in order. It would be such a shame if someone couldn't make it last minute. These international trips are so complicated. I started getting paranoid, but I thought I was just being crazy. Then my coworker at the print shop jokingly said, you should make a fake passport just in case she tries something. We both laughed, but honestly, something about Valerie's behavior had me worried. So the day before we left, I actually did it. I used our high end printers at Work to create a convincing fake passport. Same photo, same info, but completely bogus. I figured if Valerie was planning something, at least I'd be prepared. That morning, I was in their kitchen finishing my packing when Valerie appeared. She had this weird gleam in her eyes that immediately put me on edge. You know what, Amanda? I'm done pretending to like you, she said suddenly, her voice dripping Venom. I've been waiting three years for the perfect moment to get rid of you. Before I could even process what was happening, she lunged for my passport sitting on the counter. I tried to grab it, but she was faster. Oops, looks like you can't come to Italy after all, I said with the most evil smirk I've ever seen. She pulled out her kitchen lighter and set the passport on fire right there in the sink. I watched it burn completely to ash while she stood there looking absolutely triumphant. Guess you'll have to stay home while we have the time of our lives in Rome, she taunted. That's when I started laughing. Full on belly deep laughter.

What are you doing in your final days? As a single dad with two kids, my biggest fear wasn't death itself. It was leaving my 8 and 11 year old boys alone after they'd already lost their mom two years ago. Unfortunately, my cancer had spread everywhere and my only shot at survival was an experimental treatment that required being in a medically induced coma for months. Even then, I had maybe a 1% chance of waking up. Everyone had already accepted I wasn't coming back. Funeral planned, headstone selected and my sister in law ready to take care of my children. The night before surgery, I asked my best friend, Logan, to come over for one last beer. We've been brothers since college. He was the godfather to both my children. We talked about old times, laughed about stupid things we've done. Until I asked him for the biggest favor of my life. I told him I needed someone to be there for my boys. Not just handle money or logistics, but really be there. Be the father figure they'd need. He looked me straight in the eyes and gave me his word. Said those boys were his too. Every game, every milestone. Teaching them to shave, to drive, to be good men. He'd be there for all of it. That promise between. This was sacred. That was all I needed to hear. My sister in law had a good heart, but Had never managed money. So I gave Logan $600,000, my entire life savings, to handle everything, pay her monthly, cover the boys expenses, make sure they never went without. I went under, trusting him completely, believing my boys would have everything they needed while I was gone. Six months later, I woke up. The doctors called it a miracle, said the treatment worked better than anyone expected. I was weak, confused, but alive. When I asked about my boys, the nurses said they were fine, that my sister in law had been taking great care of them. But when I finally got home, the truth hit me like a sledgehammer. My sister in law broke down, cry.

I got a hysterical call at eight PM from Brooklyn's mother screaming that Ariana had attacked everyone in their basement and the police were taking her away in handcuffs. I abandoned my shopping cart at target and sped cross town to find three ambulances, two police cars and dozens of parents standing in Brooklyn's driveway. Ariana was sitting in the back of a patrol car with her hands cuffed behind her back while teenagers were being treated for pepper spray exposure on the front lawn. Ariana, what have you done? I asked through the patrol car window, trying to understand why my 13 year old daughter would do something so violent. The other kids were crying and coughing, their eyes swollen shut from this. Brooklyn was sobbing on her mother's shoulder, her makeup running down her cheeks while she kept asking why her best friend would ruin her birthday. Parents were shouting about pressing charges and lawsuits while Officer Decker explained that Ariana could face multiple counts of assault. Ariana looked straight ahead, her jaw set with that stubborn expression I recognized from when she knew she was right about something. Mom, check the basement window, the one behind the water heater. Please just check it. Her voice was steady, but I could see her hands trembling where they were cuffed behind her. Brooklyn's father was furious when I asked to look in Their basement. Your daughter just assaulted 15 children, including my daughter, at her own birthday party. She planned this, brought the pepper spray hidden in her purse the kids were just dancing with. She started screaming for everyone to get down and then sprayed them all. But Officer Decker said I could examine the scene since Ariana was being detained. I went down to the basement where the party had been happening. Pink streamers and balloons were everywhere. The birthday cake sat untouched on a table. And Brooklyn's new speakers were still playing pop music. But when I looked behind the water heater where Ariana had told me to check, my eyes widened. The window lock was broken, twisted metal hanging loose. And there, there were fresh MUD prints on the carpet underneath that were far too large to belong to any of the kids at the party. When I told Officer Decker, he called for backup immediately and started searching the basement more thoroughly. While he was checking the storage area, Ariana finally explained what had happened from the back of the patrol car. She'd been watching everyone dancing when she noticed.

Y'all were always talking, laughing at dumb stuff, venting, being weird together, making the most unhinged inside I jokes that nobody else would get. And now they're just gone. Not even gone like we grew apart, but, like, replaced. Like they found a new group and suddenly forgot you existed. And they swear they still care. But the I'm going to sleep early is getting old. Especially when I see you online, in games, in calls with your new little friend group. Like, bro, I'm not stupid. I see the green dot. I see the whole friend list active. Don't lie to me and say it's nothing. You just stop choosing me. And what hurts more is feeling like I'm just a backup now. I'm being kept around just in case the new group drops you or switches up. Like I'm the in case of emergency friend. I'm not a fostering safety net. You used to need me. Now I'm just convenient when you're bored. And I see it, I feel it, and it sucks. But you know what? I'm done begging for space in your life. I'm done waiting for a text back just to see you on Facetime with the new crew. I'm done being loyal to someone who already left me without saying a word. So, yeah, it hurts. It hurts like hell. But I'm not gonna sit here and cry over someone who doesn't miss me. I'm gonna wipe my tears, put on lip gloss or chapstick, whatever, and remind myself I'm not the problem you fumbled. I was a real one. And when that new group starts acting funny, when you remember what it felt like to have someone who actually cared, just know this friendship doesn't do returns.

The first time she opened her mouth in court, I didn't expect her words to stop a sentencing. We were packed into that courthouse like sardines. The walls felt too close, the benches too hard and my heartbeat too loud. My daughter, Olivia, just 8 years old, sat beside me, swinging her feet. She looked so small in that big room. Her Sunday dress too formal. Her hair and braids I'd redone three times that morning just to keep my hands busy. Across the aisle sat the man who had taken everything from us. He was just 20, a kid, really. He didn't look dangerous, just tired, like he hadn't slept since the night he pulled the trigger. But I didn't care how tired he looked. My husband was gone and he was still breathing. The widow of the store clerk, my husband's boss, sat silently, her eyes hollow. Next to her was her son, maybe 10, clinging to her arm. I wanted to reach for Olivia's hand, but she was busy twisting the edge of the paper heart she'd made that morning, the one I didn't have the strength to ask about. The prosecutor spoke first, cold, clinical. The victim was an innocent man, a father, a husband. This was a violent, senseless act. Then came the defense. They talked about his upbringing, broken home, drug addicted mother, foster care. They showed pictures of his bruises, his grades. His attempts at rehab. This doesn't excuse the crime, his lawyer said, but we asked the court to consider who he was before he picked up the gun. I hated how calm they all sounded, how measured, like this was just another case. The judge asked if anyone else wished to speak. I felt the weight of the room tilt toward me. Everyone expected the grieving wife to stand, but I couldn't. I'd written 10 different versions of a statement and tore up every single one. The only thing I wanted to say was give me my husband back. And that wasn't an option. Then Olivia raised her hand. I didn't even realize what she was doing until she was already standing, walking to the front like it was show and tell. The courtroom murmured. The bailiff looked to the judge, who gave a small nod. And just like that, my daughter stood before the man who murdered her father. My name is Olivia, she said, her voice small.

Then place a dead animal 4 feet above it. This way, if a police dog smells something unusual, they will only find the dead animal. If you want to get rid of a crime weapon, the best way to do it is to melt it down into a block of steel, then throw it in the ocean. This way it will sink to the bottom and if someone finds it, they will never know what it originally was. If you want to trespass onto someone's property, bring a dog leash with you. If someone asks why you're there, just tell them your dog ran off and you're trying to find it. If your grandmother is racist, create a photo montage of your brother or sister in a situation that will upset her. She will remove them from her will so you will inherit a larger share. To skip class, wait for the break and hide your bag somewhere. Then when you have to go back to class, go to the teacher and explain that your school bag has disappeared and that someone probably took it as a bad joke. Now he will let you look for your things.

Kept giving vague answers like it's challenging but rewarding and I'm focusing on pronunciation right now. Meanwhile, I'm still gaming until dawn and showing up to work looking like a zombie. After a week of this, she corners me by the coffee machine. You know what? I'm having a dinner party this Saturday. Just a few people. You absolutely have to come so you can practice with Marco. My stomach drops. Oh, I wouldn't want to impose nonsense. He's been asking about you every day. He even pulled out his old Italian cookbooks to make something special. Now I feel terrible. I try to get out of it. Actually, I'm not sure I'm ready to have full conversations yet. Perfect. That's exactly why you need practice. Marco will be so patient with you. She's already walking away, calling over her shoulder. Saturday at 7, don't you dare cancel. I spend the next three days in full panic mode. I download every Italian app I can find, Duolingo, babble, Rosetta Stone. I'm watching Italian movies with subtitles during lunch breaks. I even buy an Italian English dictionary and start highlighting random phrases. But it's hopeless. You can't learn a language in three days when you're starting from zero. Friday night, I'm lying in bed at 2:00am, not gaming for once, just staring at the ceiling in dread. I consider calling in sick to work and avoiding my boss forever. Maybe I could transfer departments. Maybe I could quit and move to a different city. Saturday arrives and I'm a nervous. I show up at her house with a bottle of wine sweating through my shirt. She opens the door beaming. He's so excited to meet you. He's been cooking all day. I can smell garlic and herbs and I hear someone humming in the kitchen. She leads me through the living room where a few other co workers are chatting. They all turn and smile. Oh, this is the one learning Italian. The pressure is building. We walk into the kitchen and there's Marco, this friendly looking guy in his 50s stirring something on the stove. He turns around with his huge grin and immediately launches into rapid Italian. I catch maybe two words, Chow and Benny. I'm frozen like a deer in headlights. He's still talking, gesturing with his wooden spoon, getting more Animated by the second, my boss is watching with pride, clearly expecting me to respond. Everyone else has followed us into the kitchen, and they're all staring. The silence stretches on. Marco stops talking and looks confused. I panic and just blurt out the only thing I remembered, MI piaccia al formaggio, which means I like cheese. Dead silence. Then he starts laughing hysterically. Turns out he was testing me.

I'm the 1% of kids who never cheated in a school where everyone else did. By the time I got to high school, cheating wasn't just common. It was basically part of the curriculum. Teachers would leave answer keys on their desks and pretend not to notice when kids snapped pictures. Parents would text their kids the answers during tests after bribing administrators for advanced copies. My freshman year, I watched a girl literally Google translate her entire Spanish essay during class while the teacher graded papers three feet away. Nobody cared. The kid next to me in math class had formulas written on his water bottle in tiny print. Even the so called honor students were trading answer keys through group chats. But my parents had drilled something into me since I was little. Knowledge mattered more than grades. They'd rather see me fail honestly than succeed by cheating. So while everyone else was finding shortcuts, I was actually studying. When I got to junior year, AP chemistry, things got insane. Class was known for being impossible without help. Kids would sneak formulas written on the inside of their calculator covers or trade answer sheets in the bathroom between periods. There was even a whole network where parents paid thousands to get their kids leaked test questions days in advance. My lab partner, Emma, kept asking if I wanted to join their group chat where they shared answers. He couldn't understand why I Kept saying, no, everyone does it, she'd whisper during tests. The teacher expects it. But I kept my head down and worked through the problems myself. One Tuesday morning, everything changed. We were taking our midterm when the principal walked in with two

But she started shaking when she realized what she had done. We were supposed to leave for Italy the next morning. My husband's whole family was going, parents, siblings, everyone. This was supposed to be our dream vacation to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. I was so excited since I've never been to Europe before. But my mother in law, Valerie, has always absolutely hated me. From day one, she's made it crystal clear that she thinks I'm not good enough for her. Precious. She's made my life hell for the past 3 years with constant passive aggressive comments and deliberate exclusions from family events. The worst part, my husband just stands there and lets it happen. He never defends me, never calls her out. It's like he's terrified of Mommy dearest. For weeks leading up to this trip, Valerie had been making little comments, oh, I hope everyone's paperwork is in order. It would be such a shame if someone couldn't make it last minute. These international trips are so complicated. I started getting paranoid, but I thought I was just being crazy. Then my coworker at the print shop jokingly said, you should make a fake passport just in case she tries something. We both laughed, but honestly, something about Valerie's behavior had me worried. So the day before we left, I actually did it. I used our high end printers at Work to create a convincing fake passport. Same photo, same info, but completely bogus. I figured if Valerie was planning something, at least I'd be prepared. That morning I was in their kitchen finishing my packing when Valerie appeared. She had this weird gleam in her eyes that immediately put me on edge. You know what, Amanda? I'm done pretending to like you, she said. Suddenly, her voice dripping venom. I've been waiting three years for the perfect moment to get rid of you. Before I could even process what was happening, she lunged for my passport sitting on the counter. I tried to grab it, but she was faster. Oops, looks like you can't come to Italy after all, I said. With the most evil smirk I've ever seen, she pulled out her kitchen lighter and set the passport on fire right there in the sink. I watched it burn completely to ash while she stood there looking absolutely triumphant. Guess you'll have to stay home while we have the time of our lives in Rome, she taunted. That's when I started laughing, full on, belly deep laughter.

Okay, so I'm a 31 year old single mom to my daughter Emma, who's 8. Last month I found out about this summer program at her school where kids can go before the year starts to do fun activities and get used to their new classroom. Emma was super excited about it. So we went shopping for all the required supplies. Now here's the thing. At Emma's old school, kids would steal her stuff constantly. Her cute erasers would disappear. Her good colored pencils would vanish and she'd come home upset asking why everyone took her things. So this time I wasn't taking any chances. I went full mom mode on those supplies. I used permanent marker to write E, m, m, a in big letters on every single crayon, marker, glue stick and even the individual pieces of paper in her notebook. I glued her name onto her clear backpack with industrial adhesive so nobody could peel it off. I wrote her initials on every single page of her sketchbook. I even carved her name into her pencil case with a knife. Emma thought it was fun watching me label everything. We made it into a game where she'd hand me each item and I'd find a new spot to put her name. By the end, you couldn't look at any of her supplies without seeing E, m, m. A written somewhere. The day of the program arrives, And Emma's bouncing off the walls, excited. I packed her labeled backpack, gave her a kiss and sent her off. When I picked her up that afternoon, she looked confused and kind of sad. Turns out the teacher had made an announcement that all the supplies were going into a big communal pile to be shared equally among all the kids. The teacher said some families couldn't afford to buy supplies, so they were redistributing everything to make it fair. But here's where it gets crazy. When the teacher started sorting through the supplies and saw E, m, m. A written on literally everything, she got annoyed. She apparently held up Emma's crayon box in front of the whole class and said, this is what happens when parents don't read the instructions properly and made Emma feel embarrassed. Then the teacher called me that evening. She explained that they pull all supplies together because not every family can afford the full list. Some kids show up with nothing and they don't want anyone to feel left out. I told her I understood the concept.

His name is George Zin. He's 71 years old. And according to police documents, he literally admitted that he protect ended to be the attacker. Like, his plan was to distract everyone from the real person so he could be seen as some kind of martyr girl. What? At the scene, he even shouted twice, I did it, now take me down! Like he was in a movie or something. But when police asked him where the weapon was, he obviously couldn't answer because he never had one. Later at the hospital, he told officers he was glad he lied because it gave the real suspect time to get away. Like, sir, this is not a game. And then it gets even worse. When investigators tried to check his phone, he didn't want them to. When they asked why, he literally admitted it was because he used it to look at illegal child content. Who just says that out loud? And of course, when they searched, they found over 20 illegal images and some really disturbing messages. For context, this man has already been arrested multiple times over the last 30 years, mostly for political trespassing. But now he's facing charges for obstructing justice.

The first time she opened her mouth in court, I didn't expect her words to stop a sentencing. We were packed into that courthouse like sardines. The walls felt too close, the benches too hard and my heartbeat too loud. My daughter, Olivia, just 8 years old, sat beside me, swinging her feet. She looked so small in that big room. Her Sunday dress too formal. Her hair and braids I'd redone three times that morning just to keep my hands busy. Across the aisle sat the man who had taken everything from us. He was just 20, a kid, really. He didn't look dangerous, just tired, like he hadn't slept since the night he pulled the trigger. But I didn't care how tired he looked. My husband was gone and he was still breathing. The widow of the store clerk, my husband's boss, sat silently, her eyes hollow. Next to her was her son, maybe 10, clinging to her arm. I wanted to reach for Olivia's hand, but she was busy twisting the edge of the paper heart she made that morning, the one I didn't have the strength to ask about. The prosecutor spoke first, cold, clinical. The victim was an innocent man, a father, a husband. This was a violent, senseless act. Then came the defense. They talked about his upbringing, broken home, drug addicted mother, foster care. They showed pictures of his bruises, his grades. His attempts at rehab. This doesn't excuse the crime, his lawyer said, but we asked the court to consider who he was before he picked up the gun. I hated how calm they all sounded, how measured, like this was just another case. The judge asked if anyone else wished to speak. I felt the weight of the room tilt toward me. Everyone expected the grieving wife to stand, but I couldn't. I'd written 10 different versions of a statement and tore up every single one. The only thing I wanted to say was give me my husband back. And that wasn't an option. Then Olivia raised her hand. I didn't even realize what she was doing until she was already standing, walking to the front like it was show and tell. The courtroom murmured. The bailiff looked to the judge, who gave a small nod. And just like that, my daughter stood before the man who murdered her father. My name is Olivia, she said, her voice small.

I discovered my husband was cheating on me at 30,000 feet and the entire plane witnessed the fallout. We were flying to Hawaii for our 10th anniversary when I noticed he kept getting texts and grinning like a teenager. Work emergency, he said. Quickly flipping his phone face down. When he went to the bathroom, curiosity got the better of me. The messages were still open on his screen. Can't wait until you dump her. Tomorrow we start our real life together. I love you, Sarah. My blood turned to ice. Ice rolled up and found months of messages, hotel receipts, photos I definitely didn't take. Sarah was my best friend. When he came back, I was holding his phone with shaking hands. So Hawaii is where you're planning to break up with me? His face went completely white. Babe, I can explain. Explain what? That you've been dating my best friend for 8 months. The couple next to us stopped pretending they weren't listening. Keep your voice down, he hissed. People are staring. Good. Let them stare. I stood up in the aisle and held up his phone. Ladies and gentlemen, my husband just brought me on a romantic anniversary trip to dump me for my best friend. The entire section turned to look at us. Sarah, if you're listening to this voicemail later, thanks for being such a supportive friend. Sit down, he whispered urgently. You're embarrassing yourself. I'm embarrassing myself. A flight Attendant rushed over. Is there a problem here? Yes, I said calmly. My husband needs a different seat. We're getting divorced, ma'am. We can't change seats mid flight. Actually, said the woman next to us, I'll trade with him. Nobody should have to sit next to a cheater. The man across the aisle raised his hand. I'll move too, if needed. This is better than in flight entertainment. Within five minutes, the entire row had reorganized itself around my marital drama. My husband ended up squeezed in a middle seat, but between two large men who kept giving him dirty looks. One of them leaned over and said loudly, 10 years and you throw it away for her best friend. That's cold, man. The other guy chimed in. My wife would have thrown me off the plane at this altitude. The flight attendant brought me free chicken nuggets and whispered, good for you, honey. But the real magic happened over the next four hours. A woman two rows back came over with tissues and watermelon juice. I, I've been there. It gets better. The businessman across from me offered his lawyer's card. She specializes in cheating spouse cases. Tell her Mike from United Flight 4, 47 sent you.

My phone buzzed during a client presentation with the number every parent dread seeing during work hours. It only means something has gone horribly wrong at school. Secretary's voice was tight with barely controlled panic when I answered. You need to come to the school immediately. There's been an incident regarding your son Patrick with the Mother's Day Celebration that requires your immediate attention. I apologized to my clients and drove to the elementary school, my hands gripping the steering wheel until my knuckles turned white. Patrick had never been in trouble before, and this was completely out of character for my quiet eight year old who usually spent recess reading books about dinosaurs. The main office was in complete chaos when I arrived, with parents flooding in and the principal trying to manage what looked like a full scale crisis. The new teacher stood in the corner looking shell shocked. Through the glass window of the conference room, I could see Patrick sitting at the table with his chin raised defiantly. Torn paper and destroyed crafts covered every surface like someone had detonated a craft store there. New teacher launched into her explanation before I even sat down. Your son destroyed six weeks of Mother's Day projects that the children have been working on, including cards and painted handprints and clay sculptures that were supposed to be gifts. She pulled out her phone to show me a video she'd Taken and I watched my sweet Patrick systematically ripping apart every single card on the display table while his classmates watched in stunned silence. He destroyed everything. Right as parents were arriving for our special Mother's Day presentation where the children were supposed to read their cards aloud. The principal shifted uncomfortably in his seat while the teacher continued her tirade about destruction of property and traumatizing other students and how this would go on Patrick's permanent record. Patrick hadn't said a word yet, but tears were streaming down his face with his jaw clenched tight. Patrick, you need to tell me exactly what happened, I said softly, while crouching down to his eye level. He wiped his nose with the back of his hand and took a shuddering breath before speaking. The teacher made Celia make a Mother's Day card even though her mom died in that car accident where the truck ran the red light two weeks ago. The temperature in the room seemed to drop 10 degrees as Patrick continued. Celia's mom was everyone's mom, too, because she came every Tuesday to help with reading groups, and she brought everyone birthday cupcakes. And she taught us how to tie our shoes with the bunny ears. My throat constrict

My boyfriend, Felipe, had been making little comments about my talking for months, saying I could bore anyone to death or asking if I ever ran out of things to say. I told myself it was just him joking. But one night at his best friend's party, I was telling her about my promotion and he said, Jesus Christ, would you just shut the f up for once in your life? He said loud enough for the whole party to hear. Nobody cares about your boring job and you sound like a desperate attention whore. Everyone went dead silent while my face burned and Felipe just laughed and said this was what he dealt with every day. I didn't say another word the rest of the night and Felipe was loving it on the drive home, cranking up the music and going on about how peaceful everything was without my yapping. When I stayed quiet through Sunday, breakfast, too, he literally kissed my forehead and said, we should do this more often. I didn't talk the rest of Sunday, which he seemed to love. But then Monday morning, he missed his huge presentation because I didn't remind him to set his alarm like I always did. He woke up two hours late, losing his mind about why I didn't wake him. I just stared at him while he ran around like a headless chicken trying to find His laptop and his good tie. His boss called to tell him not to bother coming in at all. And Felipe spent the whole night raging about almost getting fired while I sat there silent, making him even matter. This is your fault, he kept saying. But I just looked at him with dead eyes and said nothing. Then he completely forgot his mom's 60 birthday dinner because I usually handle all family stuff for him. She left six sobbing voicemails that I obviously didn't mention, each one more hysterical than the last. And by the time he checked his phone, she was convinced he hated her. He called me a psycho bitch for taking this so far. But honestly, his tantrum just made me more committed to never speaking to him again. His mom called his sister crying about how her only son had abandoned her. And suddenly the whole family was involved in the drama. Everything snowballed from there because his coworker had stopped by our apartment Tuesday when he wasn't home. And I just stood there mute while she asked if I was okay for like 10 minutes straight. She kept asking if Phillip hurt me, if I needed help, if I could blink twice for yes. And I just stared at her until she left looking terrified. She went back to the office convinced Felipe was abusing me. And suddenly he was getting called into meetings about domestic violence resources and mandatory counseling. His boss literally Asked if they needed to do a welfare check on me and Felipe had to explain that I was giving him the silent treatment, which made him sound even more like an abuser. Friday's company gala was absolutely beautiful to watch unfold. Every executive who tried talking to me got complete silence while Felipe scrambled to explain I was just shy, which nobody bought because I've been chat. At last year's event, the CEO's wife cornered me in the bathroom trying to slip me women's shelter pamphlets. And when I wouldn't respond, she called security to make sure Felipe wasn't holding me hostage or something. HR put him on immediate leave before we even made it to the parking lot, saying they needed to investigate the concerning reports about his home situation. Saturday, his friends came over for game night and finally understood why everyone was worried. What the hell did you do to her? His best friend asked. After I served snacks, without saying a word, Felipe actually admitted what he said and you could feel the temperature drop. They all left making excuses about early mornings and forgotten commitments. And his best friend told me I deserved better on his way out, which made Felipe throw a beer bottle at the wall after they were gone. By Sunday, Felipe was coming apart at the seams because his sister was threatening to call the cops, his mom had disowned him and his job was investigating him for abuse. Just Say something, he screamed, following me around the house. One word and this nightmare ends. But I walked past him toward the garage to grab orange juice from the air fridge, still not making a sound even when he grabbed my arm trying to stop me. The garage was a death trap of crap from the previous owners, paint cans from the 80s, boxes of rusted tools, old chemicals, all piled on these rickety metal shelves that look like they'd collapse if you breathed on them wrong. He followed me in there still.

My brother and I used to sneak out all the time. Not for anything wild, just dumb, harmless stuff. Late night 7 11 runs, laying on the trampoline to watch for meteors. One time, we snuck out just to see if the new Taco Bell was open 24 hours. We weren't rebels, just bored kids who liked feeling like we were getting away with something. It started when I was 11 and he was 14. He tapped three times on my wall around midnight. Our signal. I tiptoed past our parents'room in my socks, meet by the laundry door, and we'd sneak out like little burglars in pajamas. He always carried a backpack with snacks, flashlights, and a notebook he pretended was mission logs. I think he just liked pretending we were spies. It became our tradition. Even when we weren't talking much during the day, we'd still sneak out. One time, I fell asleep and missed the signal. The next morning, he left a granola bar and a sticky note in my sock drawer that said, rookie mistake. You're on thin ice, Agent B. But as we got older, things changed. He got busier with school, started driving, started dating. I assumed we just outgrown it. No more nightly missions, no more late Taco Bell disappointments. I tap on the wall sometimes just to see. But he never knocked back. Then one night, about a year after our last mission, I couldn't sleep too much. Energy. I tapped on the wall, knowing it was pointless, but out of habit I crept to the laundry room anyway, and the back door was already open. I stepped outside. It was cold. Damn. The kind of quiet where even your own footsteps feel too loud. I walked to the side gate, and that's when I saw him sitting in the driveway, hoodie up, facing away from me. His backpack. The backpack was next to him. I almost called out, but something about the way he was sitting stopped me. Shoulders hunched, arms on his knees, like he was holding something back. I moved closer and heard it. Quiet, shaky breathing. Then a. He was crying. I crouched down beside the car, not sure if I should say anything, but then I heard him mumble something under his breath. I can't do it anymore. He wiped his face on his sleeve and pulled out his phone. I peeked around the car just enough to see the screen. It was a message thread with someone initialed M. The most recent message from her said, just tell them you don't have to stay for him. He started typing, erased it, and started again. I will tonight. I promise. Then he dropped the phone in his lap and buried his face in his hands. I ducked back behind the car, heart pounding. I didn't know what any of that meant, but I suddenly felt like I wasn't supposed to be there. Like I had seen something fragile. Something I wasn't meant to interrupt. I tiptoed back inside, closed the door silently, and got into bed. I didn't sleep. The next morning, everything seemed normal. He joked with mom over breakfast. Offered me the last waffle like he wasn't about to vanish in the dark. Just hours earlier, I wanted to ask him what was wrong. The words never came out. That night, I tapped the wall once, twice, three times. No response. But around midnight, I found a sticky note on my window sill. It just said, one last mission. Meet me out back. Agent A. We didn't go far. Just sat on the grass and shared the same granola bars from years ago. He didn't bring the backpack this time. Didn't say why. Eventually, I asked.

When I was 12, my dad made a bet with me that I couldn't go a whole month without asking him for money. He said if I could do it, he'd give me 50 bucks. But if I asked even once, I had to clean the garage for free. I was cocky and took the bed immediately. The first week was easy. I ate school lunch instead of buying snacks from the vending machine. I didn't ask for movie money when my friends went to see Spider Man. I even walked everywhere instead of asking for bus fare. My dad seemed surprised I was actually sticking to it. Week 2 got harder. My bike chain broke and I had to walk 30 minutes to school every day. My friends kept inviting me places I couldn't afford. When Jake asked why I never had money anymore, I just said I was saving up for something special. I didn't want to admit I was doing some weird bet with my dad. By week 3, I was getting desperate. I found quarters in the couch cushions and sold my Pokemon cards to Tyler for $5. I even collected cans from our neighbor's recycling bins when they put them out. My mom asked why I was suddenly so interested in cleaning up the neighborhood, but I just shrugged and said I was being helpful. The last week was torture. My friends were planning To go to the arcade for Emma's birthday. And I had to pretend I was sick so I wouldn't have to explain why I couldn't come. I ate peanut butter sandwiches for lunch every day because I'd run out of lunch money. My stomach growled constantly during math class. But I made it 30 days without asking my dad add for a single dollar. I was so proud. When I marched into his office that Sunday evening and told him I'd won, he looked up from his laptop with this weird expression I'd never seen before, kind of sad but trying to smile. He reached into his wallet and pulled out the $50. But as he handed it to me, he said something that made my stomach drop. You know, kiddo, you never had to.

I found my work crush share crying in the break room looking completely stressed. My dad's in the hospital and I need to fly out tonight but I can't find anyone to watch my kids. My ex won't answer. The babysitter I hired bailed and I just, I can't afford to miss this flight, but I can't afford anything else either. She leaned against my shoulder crying even harder. I volunteered without thinking. I'll watch them, I said. Heart racing from how close she was to me. Are you serious? It's three kids. Three for at least two weeks. I waved my hand around like a lovesick fool. How hard can it be? The kids showed up at my apartment that night with tons of suitcases. The oldest around 14 looked at her mom and said, really? Another boyfriend? Cher's face went red. He's just a friend from work. Camilla, the middle one, 10, rolled his eyes. The youngest, Kevin, wouldn't even look at me. They stood in my doorway like they were being sentenced to prison. Cher hug them quickly, told them to be good and left for the airport. I stood there with 3 kids who clearly hated me and realized I was in way over my head. First morning I woke up early to make them pancakes. When the oldest one, Camilla, laughed, she's not here, you know, you can stop trying, she said. Besides, you're Not her type. Mom doesn't date guys without kids. We've seen this a dozen times already. It hurt, but it wasn't a lie. Shares, co workers, guys from her gym, men from dating apps, everyone wanted to play dad until they realized kids meant actual work. And the kids really didn't make it any easier. From spilling drinks on my laptop to turning the TV up during important zoom meetings, they hated every second with me. Dude, just survive until she gets back, then ask her out. My friend told me that became the plan. Survive two weeks, do whatever to keep the kids happy, be the hero, finally land a date with share. But like most things, it doesn't always happen the way you want it to. Sometime within the second week, the middle kid, Murph, came home from school trying to hide a black eye. Before I could even ask, Camilla grabbed ice from the freezer and held it against his face. Just pretend you didn't see anything, she told me coldly. I bent down beside them and asked in a kind but stern voice, tell me what happened. Leave me alone, he said, turning away. I shook my head. I'm not here to lecture you or get mad at you or do anything without your permission, not even tell your mom. But I need to know what happened. Murph blinked at me and frowned. Someone called me an orphan because I don't have a dad, I patted. His head and thanked him, walking away as calm as I could, even though all the blood in my body was boiling with anger. The next afternoon, I took a half day at work and showed up at their school in a rented GTR, strikingly white engine purring like a monster. I rolled down the window and waved wearing sunglasses and a black polo. Who's got the coolest dad now, I said loudly as Murph and his friends ran over excitedly. Murph watched his bully's jaw drop and quickly he hopped in. He rolled down the window and flipped him off, which was my signal to immediately drive off the middle school campus. Okay, I like the enthusiasm, but let's never tell your mother about this, I said. I picked up the other two kids and took them to in and out for a quick afternoon snack, then surprised them with a baseball game. Murph ate in a helmet full of nachos and I managed to snag a foul ball for little Celia. Not bad, old man, Camilla said, watching her siblings enjoy the game, we made sure to take pics with the car and at the stadium, all covered in ketchup and mustard, I and everything to their mom with a caption, we wish you were here. After that, things between me and the kids sort of changed. When the youngest, Celia, had a nightmare and called for her mom, I sat beside her bed reading out fairy tales. Until she fell asleep.

Logan had been complaining for weeks that I hovered too much. When we went out at his company's holiday party, he pulled me aside near the coat check. Listen. Tonight, can you just not be so attached to me? My co workers think it's weird how you're always by my side. Just mingle on your own. For once, I smiled sweetly. Of course, babe, I'll give you tons of space. Really? You're not upset? Not at all. You want independence at parties? You got it. The party was at this upscale rooftop venue, open bar, DJ, the Works. Logan immediately ditched me to bro out with his work buddies, leaving me by the entrance. Perfect. I walked straight to the bar where his boss, Thomas was getting drinks. Emily, where's Logan? Oh, he wanted space. Tonight I'm flying solo. Thomas looked confused at his own company party. He says I'm too clingy, didn't want me cramping his style. Thomas's wife Diane overheard. He left you alone. How rude. No worries. I'll just entertain myself. And I did. I ended up in a fascinating conversation with the CFO about crypto. Then the head of HR pulled me into their group to settle a debate about true crime podcasts. I was having a genuinely great time. An hour in, I Logan's eye across the room. He was with his bros but kept glancing over. As I laughed with his supervisors, then the DJ started playing salsa music. This gorgeous guy from Accounting, Javier, asked if I could dance love to. We tore up that dance floor. Turns out Javier was a semi professional dancer. He spun me, dipped me the whole nine yards. A crowd formed to watch. Logan appeared suddenly. Hey, maybe we should, oh, am I being too clingy? I asked mid spin. No, I just, great. Then you won't mind if I keep dancing. Javier dipped me dramatically. The crowd cheered. Logan retreated to the bar Downing whiskey with his confused buddies. Later, the CEO's wife pulled me aside. You're Logan's girlfriend. We need to talk. She dragged me to her table full of executives wives. They immediately adopted me, pouring champagne and gossiping about everyone. Logan usually brags about you non stop. One said, where is he? He needed guy time. Apparently I hover. They exchanged looks. Men are idiots, the CEO's wife declared, raising her glass. We toasted to that. Logan kept trying to approach, but every time he got close, someone else would pull me into conversation. His female co workers wanted workout tips. The it guys needed restaurant recommendations. Even the janitor asked for relationship advice. Everyone loved me except Logan who looked increasingly miserable. Then came the speeches. The CEO grabbed the mic thanking everyone for their hard work. Special shout out to Emily for bringing such amazing energy Tonight. Logan, you're a lucky man. Everyone Clapped, looking around for Logan. He was sulking by the bathroom. Where's Logan? The CEO asked into the mic. He wanted space, someone yelled. Laughter erupted. The CEO's wife grabbed the mic. Well, his loss. Emily's been the life of the party. More cheering. Logan's face went red. Around midnight, the party was winding down. I was ex.

I live in a sketchy little neighborhood where everyone minds their business except for this one dude. Let's call him Rico. Rico is, well, he's like a local cryptid. No one knows where he lives but he appears at 3:00am yelling about government conspiracies, anime girls and how he once fought a raccoon with his bare hands. Classic Rico. Anyway, last night I'm walking back from the corner store with a bag of Hot Cheetos and chocolate milk living my best trashy life when out of nowhere Rico lunges at me like a feral possum in heat. He's screaming something about me stealing his aura. At this point my fight or flight kicked in and apparently my brain chose black magic. See, I've been dabbling in some alternative arts lately. Long story short, I had a transformation Hex saved on my notes app. Don't ask why, just accept it. So mid lunch I screamed the words, clap my hands together and suddenly poof, Rico is no longer Rico. Rico is now Rianna. Pink crop top, cat ears, thigh high socks, eyeliner sharper than my credit score, the full Femboy starter pack. He blinks, I blink. We both stand there for a solid five seconds like, did that just happen? Fast forward to today and uh, I may have listed him on Etsy under Handcrafted Chaos Beings. Someone from Portland bought him within 3 Minutes for 275 plus shipping. Now I'm sitting here sipping my chocolate milk, trying to process the fact that I may have invented a new side hustle. Before anyone asks, yes, Rico. Now Rihanna is thriving. The buyer sent me pics. He's got a made outfit. Now I don't know how to feel.

So my brother Jake got married like three weeks ago and the whole thing was basically a slap in the face. His wife Megan decided nobody under 21 could come because they were serving alcohol and didn't want any minors getting drunk. I was 19 at the time, which apparently made me some kind of liability. The excuse was complete bullshit and everyone knew it. I don't even drink that much, maybe a beer here and there with friends, but I'm not some alcoholic teenager who's gonna embarrass their precious wedding. But whatever, that's what they decided and my parents just went along with it like always. I asked them to reconsider a few times because honestly it hurt. Jake and I used to be close growing up, shared a room until I was 14, played video games together, the whole thing. But ever since he started dating Megan two years ago, she's basically been calling all the shots. She thinks she's better than everyone because her dad owns some car dealership and she went to private school. After they kept saying no, I just stopped caring. If I wasn't good enough for their wedding, then fine, I wasn't gonna beg anymore. Then last Saturday rolls around and Jake text, it's our family group chat saying he wants everyone to go to some fancy steakhouse to celebrate the wedding. My parents were All excited, talking about how nice it would be to finally celebrate as a family. But I just replied that I wasn't going. My mom called me right away asking why not. I told her the same thing I told everyone else, didn't see the point in celebrating something I wasn't even invited to. She tried to guilt trip me saying it would mean a lot to Jake and that my cousins Becca and Tyler were going even though they didn't get invited either. But here's the thing. Becca is 13 and Tyler is 15. Their parents literally forced them to go. They didn't have a choice. I'm 19. I pay my own phone Bill. I work at Best Buy part time and I'm starting community college in the fall. Can make my own decisions about where I spend my Saturday night. My parents kept trying to convince me all week. My dad even offered to pay for my meal, which honestly just made it worse. Like you couldn't fight for me to be at the actual wedding, but now you wanna throw money at me to show up to the Celebration dinner. The night of the dinner, I stayed home and ordered pizza. I was playing call of duty with my friends when my phone started blowing up. First it was Jake texting me asking where I was and Megan sent me this long paragraph about how disappointed she was that I couldn't be mature enough to support my brother's Happiness. The funniest part is they acted all surprised that I didn't show up. I literally told them I wasn't going. What did they expect? After they got home from dinner, Jake came to my room and tried to have some.

Back in sixth grade, I was the super quiet kid who barely talked to anyone. I'd sit alone at lunch every day, counting the exact change in my pocket to see if I could afford a milk carton. Most days I couldn't. My parents were going through a messy divorce and money was tight. Really tight. One day I'm standing in the lunch line, stomach growling, holding my last seventy five cents. I punch in my student ID number to buy milk, but the lunch lady, Mrs. Garcia, accidentally hits the wrong buttons instead of my number. She types 0 1 4 8 6 5. The register beeps screen and says approved. I'm confused, but I take my milk and walk away fast before she notices. The next day I'm broke again, so I think what the hell, let me try that number. I punch in R 0 1 4, 8, 6, 5 and boom! It works! Free milk! I start testing it more. Free cookies, free pizza slice! This mystery account never runs out of money. By 7th grade I figured out this had to be some old students account that never got deleted from the system. Maybe they graduated years ago and the school just forgot about it. The account was like a ghost in the machine, invisible to everyone except me. But here's where it gets crazy. I started using it to help other kids too. My friend Jake would slip me a dollar, and I'd get him a full lunch tray using the ghost account. Then Emma started asking, then Tyler. Pretty soon I'm running this whole underground lunch operation. I memorized every item code. Pizza was 1:42. Chicken sandwich was 0 98. Chocolate milk was 2:03. I'd walk through the line like I owned the place, punching in orders for five different kids. The lunch ladies never questioned it because I was always polite and cleaned up after myself. By eighth grade, I had, like, 15 regular customers. Kids would pass me notes in the hallway with their orders written in code. 2 brothers, 1:42. 1 brother, 0 98. Extra 2:03. I charged them half price and kept the rest as profit. Made about 40 bucks a week, which was huge money for a middle schooler. The best part was I never got greedy. I could have bought expensive stuff, but I kept it simple. Basic lunches, milk, cookies. Nothing that would raise red flags. I was like the world's most boring criminal mastermind. I even started doing food deliveries. Kids would pay me to bring lunch to their classroom if they were in detention or couldn't make it to the cafeteria. Teachers thought I was just being nice, helping out my classmates. The operation ran perfectly for almost three years. I fed probably hundreds of kids using this glitch. Never got caught once. Then freshman year of high school happened. The district decided To upgrade their entire computer system. Suddenly, every account needed

So I placed him in the back row. When I was 12, my father told me he had always wanted a son. He said it casually over dinner, like he was discussing the weather. I remember sitting there with my fork frozen midair while my mother scolded him. But he just shrugged and added, boys carry the family name. Girls are just a liability. Those words carved themselves into me. From that day on, I knew where I stood in his world. Beneath the pedestal he reserved for the son he never had. Over the years, he never missed a chance to remind me. When I brought home straight A's, he said, imagine what a boy could have done with that brain. When I got a scholarship to college, he muttered, too bad you'll just waste it when you get married. And when I told him about my first job offer, he looked at me like I'd spoken nonsense. Daughter's success doesn't matter, he said. It's not like you'll be supporting this family. So when I got engaged, I didn't expect him to celebrate. But I wasn't prepared for the cruelty that followed. We were in the living room, my fiance beside me, his hand warm over mine. As I told my parents the news. My mom gasped, beaming, hugging me tightly. My father didn't move. He stared at me for a Long moment, then said flatly, don't look at me. To walk you down the aisle. You're not the daughter I wanted. The silence afterward was suffocating. My fiance stiffened beside me, ready to speak, but I squeezed his hand. I wouldn't let my father steal another moment from me. Instead, I smiled, nodded, and excused myself from the room. But inside, I was burning. That night I called the one man who had quietly been my anchor all these years. My stepdad, Mark. He married my mom when I was 16, after my parents marriage finally collapsed under the weight of my father's bitterness. Mark was gentle where my father was harsh, steady where he was reckless. He never tried to replace my dad, but he was the one who proofread my college essays, showed me how to change a tire, and picked me up from the airport when I moved back home after school. When I asked him if he would walk me down the aisle, there was a pause on the phone. Then his voice broke. It would be the greatest honor of my life. From then on, I didn't think about my father. I poured myself into planning a wedding that reflected me and the man I loved. My father was invited, my mom insisted, and I didn't want to start a war. But I made no effort to include him. Beyond that, he didn't pay a cent, didn't offer any help, didn't ask a single question. For months I didn't hear a word from him. The day of the wedding came, and I felt radiant, wrapped in lace and love. As the music swelled and the doors opened, I looked to my right. There was Mark, standing tall in his suit, tears glistening in his eyes. He offered his arm, and I took it without hesitation. The guests rose, and together we walked toward my future.

My cousin Rachel just buried her husband and two kids last week. Car accident took them all at once. She's left with just her five year old daughter, Emma. And honestly, watching them at the funeral was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So my brother Jake and his wife Kelly show up to our house that morning. Before we head to the church, first thing Kelly does is announce she's pregnant. We're all getting ready for a funeral, and she's like, guess what, everyone, we have news. My mom congratulated her, but told her to keep it quiet for today out of respect. Did Kelly listen? Of course not. The second we get to the church, Kelly starts making these loud gagging noises and rubbing her completely flat stomach. Every time someone looked at her, she'd go, oh, sorry, morning sickness, I'm pregnant. You know, she kept saying stuff like, as a mom, I just can't imagine what Rachel's going through, which was ridiculous because Kelly doesn't have any kids yet. At the cemetery, she literally asked Rachel's sister to give up her seat so the pregnant lady could rest her feet. She'd been standing for like 10 minutes total. I was getting so annoyed, but I kept my mouth shut because it's a funeral. After the service, we went back to my aunt's house. Kelly kept making everything about herself. Someone would Mention how hard this must be for Rachel. And Kelly would jump in with, oh, I now. Now that I'm pregnant, I understand maternal instincts so much better. When people were talking about the babies who died, Kelly would rub her stomach and talk about how excited she was to be a mom. The bathroom thing was what really got me. Every time Kelly needed to use the bathroom, she'd announce, pregnant lady coming through or, baby on board needs to pee. There were, like, 30 people there grieving, and she's treating it like her personal pregnancy announcement party. But then she crossed the line. Rachel was sitting

But that's what makes the friendship solid. We fight, we argue, we roast each other for sport. And two minutes Later we're planning what to eat like nothing even happened. That's real friendship.

I'm calling every taxi company when the TV above catches my eye. Breaking news, house fire on Maple Street. That's our street. My heart stops. The camera pans to a house engulfed in flames. The address flashes on screen, 2, 47 Maple street, our house. The room starts spinning. I can't breathe. My daughter is crying now, sensing my panic, and I'm trying to comfort her while my world falls apart. Other people in the lobby are staring, but I don't care. My hands are trembling so badly I can barely hold my phone. A nurse rushes over, asking if I'm okay. But how do you explain that you're watching your life burn on live television? I'm shaking, dialing his number again, right to voicemail again and again. Where is he? Why isn't he answering? My baby girl needs her father. I need her father. The automated message plays his voice. Hey, it's Danny. Leave a message. The same voice that promised me forever. The taxi finally arrives and I'm sobbing, practically falling into the back seat. Please hurry, I beg the driver. My house is on fire. My husband might be inside. The words feel surreal leaving my mouth. Just hours ago, I was in labor. Thinking about bringing our daughter home to the nursery he painted yellow because we wanted to be surprised. The driver keeps glancing at me in the mirror. Ma'am, are you sure you should be out of the hospital? I have to know if he's alive, I whisper, kissing my baby's forehead. She smells like that Newborn sweetness mixed with hospital soap. And I realize she might never know her father. The thought makes me physically ill. When we turn onto our street, like entering hell, fire trucks everywhere, hoses snaking across the pavement, neighbors in their robes watching our entire life burn. The smoke is thick and black and I can taste it even inside the taxi. Missus Ben from next door sees me getting out of the taxi and runs over her face streaked with tears. Oh, honey, thank god you're safe. But Danny, we haven't seen Danny. The fire started hours ago. Hours ago. While I was calling him, while I was waiting, while I was believing his lies about working late projects. My baby starts crying harder like she can feel the heat from the flames. And I pull her blanket tighter around her tiny body. I find a firefighter, my voice barely working. My husband, is he okay? Did anyone get out, ma'am? Nobody was home. But he pauses, looking uncomfortable. His eyes dart to my baby, then back to my face. The fire started from a candle left burning in the bedroom. There were wine Glasses.

I hadn't seen my father in three years when he invited me to Thanksgiving at his new penthouse. After the divorce, he'd thrown himself into his tech company, becoming the millionaire he'd always dreamed of being. Meanwhile, I've been working as a cocktail waitress trying to pay off nursing school debt. Dress nice, he texted. Important people will be there. I arrived in my only designer dress, a black Versace knock off I bought at a consignment shop. Dad answered the door in a tux, sing my cheeks stiffly. Behind him stood a woman my age in diamonds that could pay my rent for a year. This is Brittany, he said, my girlfriend. She looked me up and down with barely concealed disdain. Oh, you brought someone, too. How modern. Before I could correct her, dad steered me toward the living room full of his business partners. I recognized some faces from newspaper profiles, venture capitalists, tech moguls. They're perfectly preserved wives, everyone. This is Aria, dad announced, and immediately got pulled away by his CFO. Britney's friend dripping in pearls leaned over. How long have you been with Mister Reeves? 24 years, I said. Confused. Since birth, actually, she laughed. Oh, honey, you don't have to keep up the act here. We all know how these arrangements work. That's when I realized they thought I was his paid companion. My own father's colleagues assumed I was an Escort. I opened my mouth to correct them when another woman touched my arm between us girls, she whispered, what's your hourly? My husband's friend is looking for someone discreet. I excused myself to find dad, but he was deep in conversation about orderly projections. Brittany intercepted me by the kitchen. Look, she said coldly. I don't care what arrangement you had before, but he's with me now. There's no room for both of us. Arrangement, I sputtered. I'm his, say, David. I know your type. Young, desperate, willing to do anything for money. She looked at my knockoff dress with satisfaction. At least I have class. The Turkey timer went off and dad called everyone to dinner. He'd placed me at the far end of the table, away from him and Brittany. The place card just said guest. During appetizers, the conversation turned to children. Dad's partner asked if he had kids.

It started at Thanksgiving when my cousin wouldn't shut up about me being single. She kept asking why I never brought anyone home, making these fake concerned faces at the dinner table. So when she said I must be dating someone special, I just nodded, gave him a name right on the spot. Daniel said he was busy with work. My family ate it up. But then Christmas rolled around, and my mom started asking when she could meet Daniel. My aunt kept texting about setting an extra place at dinner. I was stuck. That's when my roommate Becca suggested her co worker, Daniel, who owed her big time for covering his shifts. She showed me his Instagram. Tall, brown hair, actually decent looking. He agreed to one dinner as a favor. The problem? He didn't just show up and fake smile through dinner. He brought flowers for my mom, asked my dad about his woodworking hobby, and somehow knew my grandmother collected vintage tea cups because I'd mentioned it once when building the fake story. He even laughed at my little brother's terrible jokes about robots. My family was obsessed after that first dinner. My mom kept inviting him back. Easter brunch, my cousin's graduation party, random Sunday dinners. Daniel never said no. He text me beforehand, asking what to bring, if anyone had allergies, stuff like that. He started sending my brother updates about Basketball scores. My dad asked him to help fix our back porch. The worst part was how natural it felt. We drive to my parents house together and he'd ask about my day like we actually dated. He remembered my coffee order, knew I hated mushrooms, grab my jacket when I got cold. During family game night, he'd automatically pick me as his partner. We had inside jokes that weren't even planned. One night, after my aunt's birthday party, we sat in his car outside my apartment in complete silence. Everyone had spent the whole night saying how perfect we looked together, how lucky I was. My grandmother even pulled me aside to say Daniel was a keeper. The whole car ride home, I kept stealing glances at him, wondering what he was thinking. I started rehearsing speeches in my bathroom mirror, practice bringing it up casually over coffee. But every time I opened my mouth, nothing came out. How do you tell someone you caught feelings for a fake relationship? Everything changed at Christmas dinner. My aunt announced she'd been looking at wedding venues for us. Said she found the perfect place for next fall. Daniel laughed it off perfectly. Made some joke about her getting ahead of herself. But later that night, he texted me. We can't keep this up forever, you know? That message hit me like a truck. I realised he was ready to end this whole thing. And I wasn't. Not even close. Instead of Texting back or giving him some weird speech? I invited him over for dinner at my place. Cooked his favourite pasta dish, the one my mom always made when he came over. Set the table with actual candles, not just the overhead light. After we finished eating, I was washing dishes and he was drying them. Just like we did at my parents house. That's when I finally said it. I know this whole thing started as pretend, but it doesn't feel fake.

The courtroom erupted until I stood, handed the judge a two page document and said, check again. Judge simply looked at my wife and burst out laughing. My name is James and three months ago I caught my wife Lauren cheating with her yoga instructor. He filed for divorce immediately thinking she'd hit the Jackpot. Since we've been married for five years, Lauren strutted into that Phoenix courtroom wearing a two thousand dollar dress I'd bought her, confident as hell her lawyer was already calculating his commission on what they thought would be a four million dollar payout for my construction business and dad's inheritance. The whole courtroom was packed. Lauren had actually invited some of her friends to watch what she called James's comeuppance. Been telling everyone for weeks how she was about to become independently wealthy. Your honor, her attorney announced, adjusting his expensive tie. Mrs. Peterson deserves substantial compensation for supporting her husband's career growth during their five year marriage. Lauren actually winked at me from across the room. She thought I was just some heartbroken guy who'd roll over and pay whatever she demanded. Her friends in the gallery were practically grinning waiting for the show. But here's what Lauren didn't know. Six months before I caught her cheating, I'd started noticing weird charges on our joint credit card, expensive dinners at restaurants I'd never been to, hotel rooms Booked during girls trips that didn't add up, designer lingerie, purchases that never made it home. The final straw was when I found a 800 dollar charge at a jewelry store downtown. When I asked Lauren about it, she said she bought herself a birthday present. Problem was her birthday wasn't for four months. So I hired a private investigator named Frank. Best $5,000 I ever spent. Frank followed Lauren for six weeks. What he discovered was worse than I imagined. The yoga instructor was just the latest in a long line of a there's. There was also her personal trainer, a bartender from her favorite restaurant, and even one of my own business partners. Lauren had been using our joint accounts to fund these relationships, expensive gifts, romantic getaways, even paying for her affairs, gym memberships. She'd blown through nearly $50,000 of our money over two years. The two page document I handed Judge Ramirez wasn't financial records. It was Frank's detailed investigation report proving Lauren had been having multiple affairs for over two years, complete with time stamped photos, hotel receipts.

When my 15 year old son Jake came to me asking for cooking lessons, I thought he was finally growing up. He's been dating this girl Emma for three months and wanted to surprise her with dinner. Sweet, right? Wrong. What's her favourite food, I asked, pulling out my recipe box. Well, she loves pasta, but she's allergic to gluten and dairy and tomatoes. Oh, and nuts, actually, most fruits too. I stared at him. What exactly can she eat? Pulled out his phone and showed me a list. I'm not kidding. This girl had a notes app with 17 different food allergies. Shellfish, eggs, soy, corn, most vegetables except like three specific ones. I never seen anything like it. Jake, Honey, are you sure she's not just extremely picky, mom? No. She carries an epi pen everywhere. Last week she had to leave lunch early because someone was eating a peanut butter sandwich two tables away. So we spent the next weekend researching recipes. Everything we found either contained something on her list or tasted like cardboard. I suggested rice with plain chicken, but apparently she's also allergic to poultry. We tried quinoa salad. Nope. She reacts to most herbs and spices. By Sunday night, we'd narrowed it down to exactly one meal, plain white rice with steamed carrots and a specific brand of olive oil she could tolerate That's it for a romantic dinner? This is insane. I told my husband later, what? What does this girl eat normally? Maybe she just brings her own food everywhere, he suggested. The next day, I decided to do some detective work. I picked Jake up from school and saw Emma by the parking lot. She was eating a massive Turkey sandwich with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, basically everything on her allergy list. I drove home in silence, my brain trying to process what I just seen. Either this girl had miraculous healing powers or something else was going on. That evening, I sat Jake down. I need to ask you something about Emma's allergies. His face went red immediately. What a.

Aria was the girl who'd throw any girl under the bus for five seconds of male approval. Since freshman year, everyone knew Aria as the girl who'd loudly announced she only hung out with guys because girls are too much drama. She'd sit at the guys table, laugh at every sexist joke louder than anyone else and somehow convinced herself that calling other girls too sensitive made her special. Crazy part was the guys ate it up. Even teachers thought Aria was refreshingly laid back compared to other girls. I remember this one time in P E. When a girl complained about the boys snapping girls bra straps. Aria actually stood up and said it's just guys being guys. Stop being such a baby about it. The male coach literally thank her for being rational. That was Aria's whole thing. She was the cool girl who got it. She'd brag about watching corn with the guys, rate other girls bodies with them and called feminism victim mentality. Girls who tried to call out inappropriate behavior became her targets. He'd mock them with fake crying sounds, post their complaints on social media to ridicule them and loudly proclaim how she wasn't like those uptight bitches who couldn't take a joke. During junior year when Natalie reported getting groped at a party, Aria was the first to say Natalie was probably asking for it wearing that dress. The guys would high five her. Call her basically a dude with tits and she'd beam like she'd won the lottery. When we all came back on Monday after spring break of senior year, we were preparing for the moment Aria went off on a girl and snickered with one of her guy friends. But first period arrives and Aria walks past the guys table without even glancing at them. Not like avoiding them. Aria just walked past like they didn't exist. She sits down at a table full of girls, the same girls she'd spent three years mocking. Vivian, who she'd called a dramatic princess. Audrey, who she'd labeled attention seeking for reporting harassment. Natalie, whose reputation she'd tried to destroy. The guys started calling her over. Yo, Aria, we saved your spot. She didn't even turn her head. It was like she'd gone deaf to male voices. At first, everyone thought it was some weird joke. Maybe she lost a bet over spring break. Maybe this was some elaborate prank that would turn into the ultimate pick me moment. We were on the edge of our seats waiting, waiting for her to burst out yelling, I was right, girls are too much drama. But Aria kept sitting with the girls. She stopped responding to the guys texts, unfollowed all of them on every platform. When Ethan tried to talk to her after chemistry, she looked right through him and kept walking. Days turned into weeks. The guys went from confused to angry. They started Spreading rumors that Aria was on her period, that she turned into a crazy feminist overnight, that she was probably a lesbian. Now. They tried everything to get a reaction. Nothing. Aria just kept sitting with the girls, actually listening when they talked, not interrupting to defend male behavior. The girls were suspicious at first. Had to be some long con to gather gossip for the boys. But Aria never brought up the guys, never defended them. When Jade mentioned feeling uncomfortable about something her boyfriend said, Aria actually responded with, that's not okay. You deserve better. Everyone's jaws broke the floor. Then we all found out what happened and was so much worse than anyone imagined. Audrey revealed what she'd heard from her older brother, who went to college with Ethan's brother. During spring break, there'd been a huge party at Ethan's house while his parents were gone. Aria had gone, got drunk and crashed in the guest room. The next morning, she'd woken up early and went to find her phone. Ethan's laptop was open on the kitchen counter and the screen was on a group chat.

Like bro, a bee is a neutral, good character. It's just flying around pollinating flowers, minding its own business. It's an NPC on a peaceful side quest. If you don't bother it, it won't bother you. It's just a chill guy. But a wasp? A wasp is chaotic, evil. It was created by the universe for the sole purpose of causing problems. It spawns into the world and chooses violence. It has no mission other than to ruin your day. It doesn't even have a reason. It just wants to see the world burn. And don't even get me started on the sting. A bee stings you as a last resort, a final self destruct move. It's a kamikaze. But a wasp will sting you seven times just because you looked at it wrong. It's not self defense. It's a full blown assault for no reason. A bee is a fuzzy, cute little guy. A wasp looks like it was designed in a lab to be the final boss of all insects. It's mean. It's mean. It's a flying needle of pure hatred. One is a productive member of society and the other is a literal winged demon. If I see a bee, I'm cool. If I see a wasp, my soul is leaving my body. I'm completely cooked.

Like, bro, it's the first day of school. You wish it was summer again. Then the teacher hits you with the most cursed phrase in the universe. Let's go around the room, introduce yourself and tell us one fun thing you did this summer. Suddenly you're on a timer. You have to invent a fun thing that sounds cool but not like you're bragging. It's a high stakes social mission. And there's always that one kid who says something like, I spent a month backpacking through Europe and then I went scuba diving in Australia. Bro, calm down. We get it. You're a world traveler. Then you have the goofball who just lies for no reason. You'll say, I fought a shark and won. Wrap it up, bro. No one believes you. And you always have the person who just says, I slept. Bro, that's the most low effort answer in human history. But the worst part is when they make you play two truths and a lie. It's a public interrogation. Some kid will be like, I've met the president, I have a pet alligator and I can speak fluent French. And you know for a fact two of those are probably true because this school is a fever dream. This isn't a fun get to know you game. It's a social experiment in anxiety and deception.

The way people act like being a picky eater is some kind of moral failing. Oh, sorry. I didn't realize my taste buds needed your stamp of approval. People act like I choose to hate certain textures or gag when I smell something funky. Trust me, if I could eat everything without my brain screaming, no, bad! Wrong, I would. Do you think I like being that person who has to say, actually, I can't eat that at dinner? Do you think I enjoy scanning menus just to avoid something slimy, mushy, or with that one smell that ruins my entire appetite? And the absolute worst, when people say, just try it. Wow, thank you for that revolutionary advice. Never thought of that before. You don't understand. It's not about just trying it. Some textures are literally unbearable. Some smells make me want to throw myself into the sun. It's not being dramatic. It's how my sensory system works. So, no, I'm not being rude. I'm not being childish. I'm just trying to eat without feeling like my entire nervous system is under attack. And if that means I stick to the safe foods that actually work for me, then guess what? That's not your problem.

Dad never held back when it came to my looks. Every time I came downstairs wearing makeup, he'd shake his head and say, all that effort for what? You can't paint over ugly. When I turn 16 and started talking about maybe going to prom, he laughed and said, save your money. Nobody's asking you. Anyway. The worst part was how casual he was about it. Like he was just stating facts about the weather. Mom never said anything when he made these comments. He just get this uncomfortable look and change the subject to homework or chores. My little brother Ethan would roll his eyes, but he was only 13 and more interested in his video games than family drama. Dad worked construction and came home every night complaining about his back, his boss or how expensive everything was getting. But he always had energy to comment on my appearance. You inherited your grandmother's nose, he'd say during dinner. Poor girl. At least she found someone desperate enough. When I started my senior year and mentioned maybe going to college, he scoffed. What's the point? You'll just end up pregnant and dropped out anyway. Might as well learn to cook now. The breaking point came three weeks before graduation. I've been accepted to the community college and gotten a partial scholarship for my grades. I was so excited I printed Out the letter and left it on the kitchen table for everyone to see. When dad got home and saw it, he didn't even congratulate me. Instead, he looked at me and said, college won't fix your face. You're still going to be too ugly to find a husband. Better learn a trade that doesn't require dealing with people. That night I called my friend Jake from chemistry class. We've been lab partners all semester and he was one of those guys who is genuinely nice to everyone. He never made me feel weird or ugly like other guys did. Wanna help me prove my dad wrong about something? I asked him. He didn't even ask what it was before saying yes. The plan was simple. Jake would come to Sunday dinner and pretend to be my boyfriend. I coached him on little details about our fake relationship. We've been dating for two months, met in chemistry class and he was planning to study engineering at the state university. Jake was actually really good looking, played soccer and had this confidence that made everything seem easy. Sunday came and I spent extra time getting ready, not because I thought it would make me pretty, but because I wanted dad to see I'd made an effort. Jake showed up right on time wearing khakis and a button down shirt carrying flower it's for mom like I'd suggested. When I introduced him as my boyfriend, Dad's face went completely blank during dinner. Jake was perfect. He complimented Mom's cooking, asked dad about his construction work, and even played video games with Ethan. Afterward, he held my hand at the table and called me beautiful twice, once when he thought dad was listening. Every time dad tried to make one of his usual comments about my appearance, Jake would jump in with something positive. I love how Jenna always knows exactly what she wants, Jake said when dad mentioned I was too picky about restaurants. She has great taste. When dad brought up my unfortunate features, Jake looked genuine.

I stared in shock. What basement? I'm giving birth at the hospital. Oh, honey, Agnes said, reaching across the table to pat my hand. The middle women have been delivering babies at home for five generations. I delivered Brent and his sisters right here in this house. My husband Brent squeezed my shoulder. Mom's delivered over 20 babies for our family. She knows what she's doing. The baby kicked hard against my ribs like it was trying to escape this conversation. We've been living in Brent's childhood home while our house underwent renovations. Not once had anyone mentioned this family tradition. I already have an OB, I said, my voice shaking. We've been planning a hospital birth. I'm high risk because of my blood pressure. Agnes waved her hand dismissively. Hospitals are where people go to die. Your own mother died giving birth in one of those places. The words hit me like a physical blow. My mother had died from complications during my birth. Brad followed me to our bedroom later that night. I was shoving clothes into my overnight bag when he grabbed my wrist. You're overreacting, he said. This is how my family does things. I'm not giving birth in some basement room with your mother playing doctor. His face hardened in a way I've never seen before. If you can't respect our Traditions. Then maybe this marriage was a mistake. I froze. You're threatening divorce? Because I want actual medical care. He showed me our prenup clause 15. In case of divorce due to irreconcilable differences about family values, you forfeit custody rights. My legs went weak. I sank onto the bed. I had no money of my own, no family since my father died last year. Without Brent, I'd lose everything, including my baby. The next weeks became a waking nightmare. Agnes started her preparations, which included drinking foul smelling teas and attending birthing circles with other women from their community. During one session, a woman named Carol pulled me aside. My sister died during one of Agnes home births five years ago. She whispered. They said it was God's will, but she bled out while Agnes refused to call an ambulance. My blood turned to ice that night. I searched online for anything about the Mitchell family. Three women had died during home births in this county over the past 15 years. Agnes name was never mentioned, but the address, this were all in this neighborhood. The headache started the following week. My vision blurred and my feet swelled so badly I couldn't wear shoes. Classic signs of preeclampsia. When I told Agnes, she gave me more herbs and said hospital monitoring would just stress baby. She took my phone the next day, said I was reading too many scary stories online. Brent agreed it was for the best. I Waited until Agnes left for her weekly grocery run and snuck to the neighbor's house. I called my old colleague who worked as a labor and delivery nurse. You need to get to a hospital now, she said, after I described my symptoms. You could have a stroke or seizure. The baby could die. I can't, I sobbed. I'll lose custody if I leave. You'll lose your life if you stay. That night at dinner, I showed Brent the information she had texted. For the first time, I saw doubt cross his face. Maybe we should just get you checked, he said quietly, just to be safe. Agnes slammed her hand on the table. Absolutely not. Doubt is what kills mothers and babies. Faith is what saves them. But Brent held firm. We'll go tomorrow morning, just for a quick check up. I never made it to morning. The contraction started at 2:00am, five weeks early. Brent ran for his keys, but Agnes had already taken them. She locked the doors from the inside with keys only she had. This is meant to be, she said. Only as I doubled over in pain. The baby knows when it's time. Brent pounded on the doors, tried to break windows, but Agnes had prepared for this. Security bars on everything. No phones, no landline in our room. She LED me to the basement, where her birthing room waited. Ancient equipment that belonged in a museum. Stained sheets, the smell of old blood, Poorly masked by incense. As the contractions intensified, I heard Agnes on an old rotary phone in the corner. Yes, the policy is

There's no hate about being plus size. In fact, I think everybody is beautiful no matter what. some of these self centered influencers don't seem to think the same. If you know, you have a plus size body, which is perfectly fine if you're healthy, you cannot go into a store like Brandy Melville, which is a store specifically made for petite sizes and teenagers, especially since they only have one size and expect their clothes to fit you. And then you go online to tell the whole world to hate on Brandy Melvo because their petite sizes couldn't fit you. And I think y'all know who I'm talking about. News flash, there's different body types besides plus size that need to have accommodations to their clothes to fit them. Brandy Melville is one of the stores that provide accommodations for petite sizes. It's the same thing as a skinny woman going into a store specifically made for plus size people like Taylor or Lane Bryant and complaining on the internet that the clothes are too baggy on them. Like what did you expect? Not everything is going to accommodate to you whether your ego believes it or not. So no, if you are not petite or close to that body type, you are most likely not going to be able to fit into petite size clothes, which is actually pretty Obvious. Oh, boy, you really solved the case this time, didn't ya, Sherlock? Maybe next time Enola will guide us towards the common sense. That's not even the bad part. The bad part is that the bickering has actually worked. There has been a noticeable increase of Brandy Melvils one size clothes. They're too big on the ones who actually need them to be small. And notice how I'm only talking about Brandy Melville. That's because it's the only store that actually has trendy style, affordable and cute clothing for petite women. The unreasonable hate is taking that away from girlies who actually need it. We need inclusivity. All bodies are beautiful until it's skinny women anyways. Who's a spray 6, 9, 0 U t.

Where did you get the money? Family meeting tomorrow. Six PM they had no idea what was coming. I'm Marcus, 26, and I've been the invisible son for years. While my parents throw Celebration parties every time my younger sister Emma gets a participation trophy in her dance classes, I quietly became the youngest regional sales director at a tech startup making serious money. The favoritism has been absolutely insane my entire life. When Emma wanted to try violin at 15, they bought her a 2 thousand dollar instrument without hesitation. When I asked for help with college textbook, dad literally handed me a McDonald's application and said, earn it yourself. When she decided violin wasn't for her and wanted to switch to dance, they enrolled her in the most expensive studio in town, paying 400 dollar monthly without blinking. Last month was the absolute final straw. Emma announced she's switching from dance to pottery because she found her true artistic calling. My parents immediately offered to fund a 3,000 dollar pottery wheel Kiln and complete studio setup. Mom was so excited she started researching pottery classes that same night, already planning Emma's artistic future. Meanwhile, I've been living off ramen noodles and sleeping on a mattress on the floor because they told me at 26 I should figure out my own finances and stop being a burden on the Family. When I asked for a small loan to help with a security deposit on a better apartment, dad gave me a 45 minute lecture about fiscal responsibility. The irony, while they were treating me like a complete financial liability, been quietly crushing it at work. Three months ago, I closed the biggest software integration deal in our company's entire history. A Fortune 500 clients signed a three year contract worth two point eight million dollars and my commission structure meant serious money was finally coming my way. That's when I got my quarterly commission check, $47,000 after taxes from that one deal alone, plus my regular salary and performance bonus. Instead of being smart and investing it responsibly, I decided to make a statement that would completely shatter their perception of my life. I walked straight into the Mercedes dealership that afternoon. The AMG C63 s was sitting in the showroom like automotive perfection. Matte black paint, twin turbo V8 engine, four 69 horsepower of pure German engineering. The kind of car that makes people stop mid conversation and just stare in amazement. Salesman initially treated me like I was completely wasting his time. Young guy in jeans and a hoodie looking at a 94,000 dollar car. He barely made eye contact. That changed real quick when I said I wanted to put 30,000 dollars down in cash and finance the rest. Suddenly I was his favorite customer. But here's the absolute genius part I didn't tell anyone about. The car or the commission. I just went about my normal routine for an entire week and my parents continue their narrative about their struggling oldest son who couldn't get his life together. Then last Friday night, I posted one casual Instagram story, nothing fancy, just a photo of my hand on the steering wheel with that iconic three pointed Mercedes star clearly visible in the corner. The caption was simple, new ride. My phone absolutely exploded within an hour. First, it was Emma who screenshot the story and sent it with confused question marks. Then my mom called twice, but I let both calls go straight to voicemail. Finally, dad called with a completely different tone. His voice was serious, almost suspicious. Just Marcus, we need to talk immediately. That car cost more than most people make in an entire year. Family meeting tomorrow, six PM sharp. Don't be late. I showed up 15 minutes early and parked right in their driveway, positioning the car perfectly so they'd see it the moment they walked outside. When dad opened the front door and saw the AMG sitting there, his face went completely white. Mom came up behind him and I watched her mouth actually fall open. So dad said, slowly, if you're involved in something illegal, we need to know right now. That's when I pulled out my phone and showed them my banking app. Account balance, $73,000. Then I handed him my employment contract, my commission statement and my Latest performance review. His hands were literally shaking as he read the numbers. $47,000 commission in one quarter. That's after taxes. I said calmly, the gross was $62,000. Mom was staring at the commission check, then at me, then back at the check. You make more than your father does. Emma just stood there in the doorway looking at the car, then at me like she was seeing me for the first time in her entire life. The golden child suddenly realizing her failure brother had been quietly building an empire while she collected participation trophies. That's when I smiled and said, next time, maybe ask about my life before assuming I'm failing at.

It sounds better than yours. I nodded. Then I quietly returned the eight thousand dollar wedding dress and booked a solo trip. What she found in her closet the next morning left her speechless. We were at the county clerk's office getting our marriage license when Iris dropped the bomb. I'm keeping Richardson, she announced to the confused clerk. But that's your ex husband's name, I said. Obviously. Richardson sounds so much better than Kowalski. Polish names are so harsh and ethnic. Richardson opens doors. The casual racism hit like a slap. But then I remembered something that made my blood freeze. She said this exact thing about her first boyfriend's Italian name years ago. This wasn't just about me. This was a pattern. I signed the papers in silence while she chatted about wedding plans, completely oblivious. That night, I made my own plans. But first I called her ex husband Mateo. Did she keep your name after the divorce for professional reasons? I asked. His bitter laugh told me everything. Professional reasons, dude. She kept it because she thought it sounded classier than her Maiden name. Stevens. She's been lying to everyone. Stevens. Her real name was Stevens. And she was ashamed of that, too. Tuesday morning she left for her spa day. I drove straight to Klein Fields with the receipt. Weddings been called off, I told the manager 15 minutes later. 8,000 $437 was Credited back to my card. But here's what she didn't know. I've been the one making all the payments. Because she'd maxed out her credit cards on designer bags she hid from me. I had receipts for everything. Next stop, the venue. I'm canceling everything. I announced the contract was in my name only. Back $4,500. Bridesmaid dresses, photographer, caterer. I systematically canceled everything I paid for. By three PM, I'd recovered nearly $20,000 of my money. Then I made one more call. To her maid of honor. Corrin. Did you know Iris is embarrassed by ethnic names? What? Her grandmother was Greek. Papadopoulos before Stevens. The hypocrisy was breathtaking. Been ashamed of her own heritage. But the real bombshell. I checked our joint savings. She'd been secretly transferring money for a surprise honeymoon that was actually a trip to see Mateo in California. Flight confirmations in her email. Then came the final touch. In her closet, where her dream dress had hung, I left a note. Since you prefer Richardson to Kowalski, I figured Richardson should pay for your dress. Good luck explaining to Mateo why you were planning to visit him next week. The guy with the harsh name next to it, I hung a Polish flag and printed photos of her flight confirmations. She came home glowing from her spa day. You should see my nails. They're perfect for the wedding. What wedding? I asked support on the coffee table. I canceled everything today. Her face went White. She bolted to the bedroom, then came storming back with my note, the flag, and the flight confirmations. You went through my email? You went through my savings account! Richardson should buy you a new one. This is psychotic. Over a name? Over you planning to cheat with your ex next week? She started calling the boutiques. Each conversation ended the same way. Everything was canceled. Waiting lists were months long. Deposits were gone. Her Instagram influencer dreams crumbled when someone screenshot her old posts about keeping Richardson for professional reasons. The comments were brutal. So you're marrying Richardson again, bro? Dodged a bullet. Her friend group imploded when the group chat leaked. calling Polish names ethnic wasn't her first offensive comment, just the first one that affected someone they knew directly. Her DEI job launched an investigation after HR saw the screenshots. Hard to promote diversity when you're on record being prejudiced against Polish names. Even her ex husband posted on Facebook. For the record, I've been telling Iris to change her name back since our divorce. It's weird. Also, Team Kowalski. Two weeks later I returned from an incredible solo trip to Japan. Found 247 texts, mostly from Iris. Day 7 Mateo heard what happened. He texted me laughing. Her influencer career was dead. Last I heard she's still single. Still Richardson. Still living with her parents. The eight thousand dollar dress hangs unworn in her childhood closet. Me? I'm dating someone new. Also Polish. Thinks Kowalski is a beautiful name. The Polish flag hangs in my living room now, not hidden in a closet. Turns out disrespecting someone's heritage is a great way to end up with no one to marry.

Called me a gold digger at her own daughter's wedding? I'm at my sister in law's wedding rehearsal dinner, and my mother in law is doing her favorite thing, which is introducing me as my son's wife who stays home because he's such a good provider. She says that to literally every person she sees each time. I try to smile and say, actually, I work from home, but she cuts me off with, yes, yes, keep in. Houses work too, dear. We know. And she's already moving to the next person, literally turning her back mid sentence like I'm a museum display. She's explaining six years of this crap. Six years of her dropping by at 10:00am and saying, must be nice to sleep in when I've been working since 5. His whole family thinks I married him for money, all because I got pregnant three months after we met and had a quickie wedding. I quit my office job to work from my laptop, which to them means I don't work at all. The aunt asks, so you're just home with the kids? And I say, I actually run a business, but she pats my hand going, oh, you have a hobby, how nice. My mother in law laughs, saying she sells things online. It's so cute, like I'm a five year old with a lemonade stand. My husband tries at dinner saying she's actually really successful, but his mom cuts him. Off with stop embarrassing her, honey, not everyone needs to be a career woman. My phone buzzes with another notification I quickly silence. My mother in law tells the wedding planner I've been between jobs for six years when they asked about the extended family of the bride. Not to mention my father in law makes a weekly joke about how I won the lottery marrying his son. The most annoying thing is when my brother in law calls me the professional mom and they all think they're being so clever. Wedding day arrives and it's this garden situation with 150 guests. I'm trying to get the kids ready when my mother in law walks in, seeing my laptop open with spreadsheets showing six figure quarterly reports and goes you shouldn't be playing games while the kids get dressed. Priorities, dear. I say it's actually my quarterly reports, but she's already talking over me. Can you help with flower arrangements since you're not busy during the reception? They seat me at the back table with the kids and elderly relatives, as where else would the housewife sit, right? The bride's college friends are at my table and ask what I do. I start to explain I run an online business, but they turn to each other before I finish saying must be nice to not have real deadlines. And as if summoned, my mother in law walks by, adding she's trying to start a little Etsy shop. Isn't that sweet, The photographer is gathering details for the album, asking about everyone's careers ever. When he gets to me, my mother in law answers for me. She's loved being a homemaker and a professional child raiser. And when I try to correct her, she goes, she's being modest. She runs after two kids all day and everyone laughs. But wait, it gets worse, because mother in law takes the microphone for her toast, and instead of talking about her lawyer daughter, the one getting married, she talks about how special her son is, how successful he is, how handsome he is, then turns to me saying, my son married for love, not money. He provides everything, while his wife gets to enjoy the simple joys of motherhood. Some women are just meant to keep house. I said it as a joke, only no one was laughing. Even the elderly relatives at my table looked uncomfortable. Not even a minute after the speech, the maid of honor, who's a fashion influencer with like two million followers, rushes over to me. I'm

My 17 year old son with down syndrome was arrested for assaulting three grocery store employees and robbing an elderly woman. The police officer's voice was stern when he called me at work. Your son Ali is being detained. He assaulted staff members and stole from a customer. The manager wants to press charges. I actually laughed out loud. Ali, my Ali, the same kid who reads stories to dogs at the shelter because he thinks they get lonely. The officer wasn't amused. Sir, three employees have injuries. You need to come immediately. When I arrived eight minutes later, Ali was sitting on the curb in handcuffs, his Pokemon shirt torn, dirt on his face. But strangest of all, he was smiling. Not his usual sweet smile, but this fierce proud grin I'd never seen before. The store manager, this thin rat faced man, was holding ice against his jaw while a blond female employee showed off scratch marks on her arms to the gathering crowd. Ali, I said, kneeling beside him, what happened? He saw me and his mood brightened. Dad, I saw them trying to scam Missus Yune, the nice grandma from next door. They were making her swipe her card over and over again. The manager immediately started screaming, he's lying. Your retard son is violent and he grabbed money from Missus Yune and attacked us. When we tried to stop him, I stood up ready to Drop this piece of nincompoop for calling my son that. But the officer stepped between us. Sir, control yourself. But regardless of what he was saying, I knew my son would never do something like that. Ali, I said, ignoring everyone else, focus on my voice. Tell me exactly what happened. His smile faded as he tried to focus. It started when I saw Missus Yune and she looked super confused. The blonde employee rolled her eyes. Oh, great. The moron is going to tell us a story. I took a step toward her, but Ali grabbed my hand and kept talking. She was at the self checkout. It kept saying error. I saw the yellow haired lady telling Missus Yune to swipe her card again and again and again. He held up his fingers seven times. Dad, I counted. The blonde employee looked like she was about to burst in anger. Shut up. But the officer held up his hand for silence. Ali continued, his voice getting stronger. Mrs. Yun said she already paid. She showed them her receipt, but the employee told her that she had to keep swiping or she couldn't leave with her groceries. Dad, remember how you warned me that's how bad people steal. They make you swipe lots of times, then take all the money. My blood was boiling now. Yes, I remember, buddy. Then what happened? I went over, I said, excuse me, that's not nice. You're tricking her. The lady called me. The R word and said I was too stupid to understand grown up things. Ali's face scrunched up at the memory and he looks scared. But I understand stealing is wrong. So I told Missus Yune to call 9 1 1. I said these people are doing crimes to you. The manager's face was purple. Now this moron doesn't know what he's talking about. Ali kept going. That's when the man grabbed Missus.

I can't wait for our trip! Oh my god, bro, you and I and my friends will have so much fun. Haha. Your friends? Yeah, Ava can come, right? Um, I guess the house can have 6 people. OMG, thank you. All of my bags are packed. I'm ready. Do you want to come over to my house or meet at the airport? Um. Babe? Yeah? Don't tell me you forgot. Um, not really, but I thought Ava already told you. Told me what? Are you okay? Is anyone hurt? Um, this is kind of awkward, but since the house can have six people in, Ava and I thought maybe this trip should be, you know, just for us. Me and all our friends. Huh. And since it's my birthday, I think I should have fun. What are you even saying? I'm at the airport right now. Where are both of you at? Well, we're already on the airplane with all our friends. We're going to the cabin beach house. What? How many of you are there? And who are your friends? It's just me and Ava, then four of her friends. Eric, Jamal, Tyrone, Leslie. What? Well, Ava was supposed to tell you. She's literally such a silly girl. Babe, she definitely just forgot to tell you. Forgot to tell me what? That you won't go with us? And you're telling me this after I took a Week off work, told my friends I'm going to a trip with my girl, then prepared for a surprise. I won't tell you on a trip that I fully paid for. Look, I'm so sorry, babe. All of my friends really appreciate you. We will love you. And they all said you're a great guy for this. They wanna hang out with you after this trip. I organized everything for both of us. Me and you. I paid for everything. I only accepted Ava because you wanted her. Tell me you're joking, please. And that is so, so generous of you. I didn't think it would bother you that much, to be honest. Because I know you're not an insecure boyfriend. This has nothing to do with insecure. I wanted to spend time with you. I was going to propose on your birthday. Mia, how can you do this? I'm really sorry, babe, but you're always so serious. This was my birthday and I wanted to have fun, make stupid decisions and get wasted. If I went with you, we won't go to the club, we won't ever drink, and we will just go to fun places, eat and swim all day. I only live once, babe, and I want to make the most of it. Just because I don't drink, it doesn't mean I'll stop you. Right, but sometimes you have to let it go. I wanna make very stupid decisions. I don't want you to spoil the mood. For me, only 22. Once in a lifetime. Sorry babe. But I will make it up for you. When I come back. You can propose to me. We should go to another trip. Just me and you this time. Have as much fun as you want. Visit all the fun places. Eat and swim all day. I still like you as a person. Adam. Hello? Are you there, Adam? Sure. Have fun. Hey babe, we're at the receptionist. They can't seem to find your name though. What name did you use? Hello? Baby, please respond. Hey. Yes. Alright, she's checking her system again. She can't find it. Try using your name. Still nothing. Oh yeah, I forgot. I cancelled the reservation. What? Why did you do that? I wanted to tell you but I'm so silly I forgot. No, no, no. Please don't do this babe. We are all exhausted from the flight. You said you wanted to make stupid decisions. Yeah, sleep on the floor. You're only 22 years old once, right? Please don't do this Adam. All my friends are so hungry and tired. Go hunt me. Stupid decisions, eh? And by the way, on your way back home Swift the Atlantic. Cause I canceled your flight ticket too. What? I'm fuck here. Adam, please. This is so messed up. How could you? It was easy. I just called them and asked to cancel everything. I'm sorry babe. Please. Please just help me come back home and I'll Fix it. I'll do anything, babe. Anything. Adam. Hello? Please respond. Don't leave me here. Hello?

I'm not fake. Finally, you responded. Leave me alone. Then leave my man alone. He's not your man anymore. At least I care about him. You just want his money. That's not true. Would you date him if he was poor? Of course. I don't believe you. I would date him if he was rich or poor. I would date him if he lived in a castle or in a tent. I would date him if he never bought me presents and he could only afford hugs and kisses. I am in love with his heart, not his wallet. It was never about money. The love I feel for him is priceless. Believe me. Now you love me. Was that you texting me? Yes. I'm sorry for tricking you. What the hell? I wanted to know how you feel. I've dated a lot of fake girls. You. You didn't trust me. Can I tell you something? Something I've never said? I love you. I will never test you again. And I will never stop loving you. I love you, too.

Just thought I would tell you since we are neighbors after all. Whatever. I don't believe you. Fine. Go down to the skatepark and see for yourself then. Ugh. Know what? Fine, I will. Then me and him are coming home and you can just keep your eyes to yourself. I was just trying to help. He doesn't seem like the man you think. We will see. Comment for part two.

What? Of course not. Why are you asking me this? Because when you went to the bathroom last night, you got a message from settings on the imessage app. Wait, why were you going through my phone? Do not turn this on me! Who is that and what are you guys messaging? It's just some tech support agent helping me with my phone. Relax, babe. It's nothing. Oh really? Luckily, I knew you would lie to me, so I unlocked your phone and checked your messages with him. And why is your tech support agent sending you willy pics that you hearted? Jake's got a better life than you anyway, we're done. Wait, not only did you cheat on me, but it was with Jake, my childhood best friend. I've known him for the past 17 years. How could you do this to me? He's far better and pretty much everything than you anyways. Have fun being lonely. How could you do this to me? Bro? Over a girl? What happened to bros before hoes? So you found out. You want a cookie now? I'll remember that. I need your help to get back at Jake. What happened? He's your best friend. Can't explain right now, but are you in or out? Aight, what do you need me to do? Jake has a business meeting with his boss tomorrow. Take a bunch of leeches and plant them in his boss's suit. Jack always carries his Laptop in a suitcase to put a jar of leeches in there. And when he takes his computer out to show his boss the work, his boss sees the jar of leeches and fires him. He gets fired next since Sarah probably left him since he lost his job. Now Jake spends a ton of time on discord to cope. Make a e girl account and catfish him. Get to know him and send him frequent selfies of some Instagram model. Now that you got his trust, ask him to send you money to fly you out. He's a SIMP so he'll fall for it once he sends it. Block him. Donate this money to a racist charity under his name. Take a screenshot of this and upload it to TikTok so that companies see that he's racist. He can't get a job in business anymore. He's got to work in fast food now. And he's probably gonna be a cook since he loves to cook. But it's 100% gonna be McDonald's since that's his favorite fast food. So go to his joint and order a 10 piece Mcnugget through the driveway. Once you get the 10 piece, eat three of them and complain to the manager that you didn't get 10. He'll get a warning with this. Do this a few more times across two days, but on Doordash with different names. He gets fired and has a bad reference since he can't even work properly in fast food. Now he can't even get a job, so he's homeless. Go up to him with a challenge. Tell him that if he can swallow a spoon of cinnamon in under one minute without water. Add on that if he does this, he gets $10,000. He's gonna take this offer up since he's homeless. Take your phone out and start recording to make it seem like it's a real YouTube video. Once he puts the cinnamon in his mouth, run for your dear life. Avenge me.

But you were so excited to sleep over. If you're tired, I can come pick you up. Where are you? So I'm kind of cheating on you with another guy. Sorry, but I found someone better. He's rich, over 6 3, he's a D1 college athlete, and has way more confidence than you. Oh, that's fine. Just don't forget to swing by tomorrow to pick up your clothes. Or would you prefer I set them on fire before you get here? You wouldn't dare burn my clothes. I'll stop by later with my new boyfriend to grab them. And when I call, you better pick up. Let me use the Cantina app to chat with Roast Bot to help me here. My girlfriend literally sent me a picture of her cheating on me, saying she found a better guy, and said she's coming to pick up her clothes later that I better answer when she calls. Help me roast her. Don't worry, bro. When she calls, just tell her you've already sold her clothes for half the price at a yard sale. You'll probably get more for them than she's worth at this point. When you call me, I will have already sold your clothes for half the price at a garage sale. Duh. So funny I'm serious, idiot. You have to try the roast bot on the Cantina app to improve your arguments. Sweetheart, I'll be kind of busy at home today. You should come tomorrow instead. Or if you keep acting up, I'll just toss your stuff in the street for you to pick. Or maybe I'll just give them to the first homeless guy I see. It'd be fun seeing a street guy rocking your Chanel shirt that I bought for you tomorrow. Won't work. I'm going to the movies with my new man, then we're going to a fancy restaurant. Oh, and one more thing. Stop chasing after me. I know losing me must feel hard right now, but you'll get over it. I don't give a. You. You're so heartless. I literally sent you a pic of me cheating and you still don't care. What can I say? Rotten food is for the starving. Rotten food? Look at me! I'm literally the type of girl every guy wants. My friends always told me to cheat on you. Hahaha they did. And in the end they were right. Huh? Especially Chloe, who always talked trash about you. You mean this Chloe? What

Why should I waste my hard earned money on rent when I can use it for more important things? My nails are due for a fill, my roots are showing, and there's a sale at the mall that I can't miss.

Meanwhile, I had to start from scratch because you sold everything I owned. And look at you now, doing just fine, which means you can take care of your mother like a good son should. No, I'm not doing this. Oh, sweetie, you don't have a choice. Yes, I do. I can say no. No, you can't, because I'm already outside your door. Open up! You're out of your mind. Go away. Oh, I will.

That her selfish son is trying to leave her homeless while he sits in a house full of things he wouldn't even have without me? You contributed nothing to my success. Nothing! Fine. I'll let myself in. What? No. You really should have hidden your spare key better. How did you even. Oh, and don't bother hiding your bank cards. I already linked my shopping apps to them. You what? I needed a little retail therapy. It's exhausting being me. Where is all my furniture? Sold. I got a really good deal on all of it. Ha ha ha ha! 300 for the entire dining set and TV.

Yesterday, my phone rang at 2:00am. It was the police. Ma'am, we have your six year old son, Tommy at the station. He walked here by himself, saying his mommy heard his baby sister. I shot out of bed. What? Tommy's in his room sleeping. And I don't have a baby sister. Ma'am, please come down to the station immediately. I ran to Tommy's room. Empty bed, front door wide open. At the police station, Tommy was wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The moment he saw me, he screamed, don't let her take me. She killed my sister. My heart stopped. The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away, too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room while Tommy sobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My Stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. I spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. His little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. The psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy's story never changed. Hours passed. The detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Ex explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She showed me the room. She made All pink and pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us?

Heather, you said it's during the week? Yes. Does he ever seem like he's trying to be secretive when you're together? And by that, I mean, like, does he say, let's meet somewhere instead of picking you up? Does he take you places that are like 45 minute drives out of town? That kind of stuff? No, not really. We're pretty open. With our dating. So like, for instance, like on Valentine's Day, he took me to the melting pot and he kissed me in the parking lot in front of everybody. So. Okay, it doesn't mean he's not married. I mean, what if his family like, lives in another town and he just works here? I don't know. I mean, I met him on a dating website and he basically talked about how hard dating is. And he told me about his ex girlfriend. He just doesn't sound like he's married. Yeah, but at the same time, I mean, he could have just been making all of that up. We know people like that. Okay, so. So you want us to do what, Heather? Find out if he's married. That would be a great start, yeah. Okay. And I guess maybe find out why he's always busy on the weekends. I mean, maybe he just likes to have alone time on the weekends. We don't know, but we can find out. Hang on the line so we can get his number from you. Okay? Okay. Okay. How much money do you wanna put on this whole married thing? How much money? Yeah, how much money you wanna bet? I don't know. I don't wanna bet money. I mean, it's. It's dirty work Wednesday. How about this? How about if.

Well, get ready to buy me lunch, because this guy is married. Alright, well we're gonna find out when we come back.

Yesterday, my phone rang at 2:00am. It was the police. Ma'am, we have your six year old son, Tommy at the station. He walked here by himself, saying his mommy heard his baby sister. I shot out of bed. What? Tommy's in his room sleeping. And I don't have a baby sister. Ma'am, please come down to the station immediately. I ran to Tommy's room. Empty bed, front door wide open. At the police station, Tommy was wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The moment he saw me, he screamed, don't let her take me. She killed my sister. My heart stopped. The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away, too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room while Tommy sobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My Stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. Spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. His little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. Psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy's story never changed. Hours passed. The detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She. She showed me the room she made all pink And pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us? But before I could answer,

Why is my laptop not turning on? I was drinking water, and then I swear to god, I felt something push me in my back. It spilt all over the laptop. I'm so sorry, Kylie. I tried wiping it down and everything. Well, there's $900 down the drain. It's okay, Riley. You're the golden girl who can do no wrong. That's what mom would say, right? Are you mad? No, I'm just ecstatic. What do you think? Riley? Riley, what have you done to my makeup? Oh, yeah, I was going to tell you about that. I had a little accident. A little accident? You ruined everything! I'm sorry, Kylie. I didn't mean 2. One thing just Broke. And then everything else followed. You need to be taught a lesson, Riley. I've had enough. Mom, Riley just destroyed $500 worth of my makeup and ruined the bathroom sink in the process. How bad is it? What is wrong with you? Kylie, I'm genuinely interested to see how you're going to flip this onto me. She might be 15, but I wasn't doing things like this at her age. Why on earth would you spend that much money on makeup? That mess is fixable. But you wouldn't have been this angry if it wasn't so expensive. And for what? To paint your face? You know what? I'm not even going to engage in this. Kylie, why is your door locked? Because I'm out. And I don't want you to go in there and cause World War 3. That makeup thing was the last straw. Riley, you know I love you, but this is unacceptable. We're family. We have to share with each other. You're my big sister. I tried to do the right thing. From now on, if you want to use my things, you're going to have to pay me. Pay you with what money? I don't have a job. Figure it out. I'm telling Mommy. Of course you are. Kylie, why are you acting like this toward your little sister? I tried doing it the nice way, mom. It didn't work. Well, when you come back, your things are going to be packed in a suitcase. What? If you two can't live with each other, then it's way easier for you to move out rather than her. You're 19 now anyway. It's about time. I'm sorry, honey. This is the only way. No, it's not. You better lock your sweet Riley in a room or something, because it won't be pretty when I see that little brat.

Yeah, but it's none of your business. Well, I think I deserve to know, since she woke me up at seven in the morning on a Saturday. Fine. She asked me if I enjoyed our bedroom life. And what did you say? Obviously, I said yes. So why is she upset? She asked what I liked about it specifically, and I told her I liked everything. Oh, that makes sense. What?

Thanks for having me over. Thanks for cooking. No problem. It's nice to put a face to the name. Yeah. If I'm being honest, I didn't expect you to look like that. Like what? Pretty. That's sweet, Adam, but you have a girlfriend. Hopefully not for long. Why do you say that? Crystal came home an hour after we had dinner last night. She ignored me and went straight to bed. That doesn't seem like a huge problem. The last time she acted like that, she was cheating on me. Wait, why are you still with her if she cheated? I'm honestly not sure. Daniela, I think you should leave her for someone who knows your value. Like who? Never mind. Talk to you later. Hey, Adam. Can you guys stop making so much noise? Sorry, Daniela. I can't stop her. She keeps yelling at me, calling me a cheater. Why does she think you're cheating? Somehow she could smell your perfume from yesterday. Is there anything I can do to help? No, she just left. Again? What if she really is cheating on you again? I don't wanna think about that. What if we could find proof if she is cheating? How? How about you come over to my place for dinner tonight?

I hate to tell you over text like this, but I'm scared to tell you in person. Wait, what? Why? You seem so happy, even though you're a bit ungrateful sometimes. Me and Gary are happy to keep you. Well, Gary gave his daughter my room and made me sleep in the office. And you just went along with it and didn't even say anything? You're 16 now. Honey, she's only nine. I thought you could handle it. Then all my stuff that was in my room, you threw out because there was no space. Honey, it was all things from years ago. It sounds to me like you need to grow up and let go of the past. I haven't even mentioned how your boyfriend Gary is always looking at me weird and trying to spend time alone with me. I don't know what his intentions are there. You're gross for thinking that. Live, Gary only has eyes for me. Plus, you're too old for him. Young. I meant young. Dad's house is bigger and I wouldn't have to sleep in an office. Mom, okay, this is ridiculous. I'm sorry that I don't have a mansion, but I've always tried my best for you. Live, I would starve myself so you could eat. Mom, what are you talking about? You've never had a job. You go from guy to guy and leech their money. And you've never been grateful for what I've Done for us. So go run to your daddy like the little girl you are. I replaced you with Gary's daughter. Anyway. Good for you. Bye. Mom. Live. It's been three weeks. Please come back. Mom, I'm happy at Dad's house. I can't live without you. I'm sorry for what I said to you. I was just angry because you were leaving. Has anything that made me want to move out been changed? Am I still going to have to sleep in an office? You're being so selfish right now. Can you just think of me for once? I need my daughter. And you need me, don't you? I don't know if I do anymore, mom. Ever since you left, I've been needing to drink to numb my pain. I've blacked out a few times. Oh, my gosh, mom, are you okay? I just need to see you live. You don't have to stay with me all the time anymore. Maybe just a couple days a week. Okay, I'll come over and we can discuss it. Dad, Mom wants to see me. I don't really wanna go, but I'm scared of what she would do to herself if I said no. You can't go alone, honey. Can you pick me up from school and take me? But don't come inside. She might flip out. Okay, I'm coming now. Honey, it's been one hour. What are you guys doing in there? Dad, she's acting crazy. I told her I can't move. Back in! And she started shouting, so I went to hide in the toilet, hoping she cools down. But now she's banging on the door and she's saying she won't let me leave with a baseball bat in her hand. And she's really drunk. Should I come inside? I don't want her to get even more angry. She doesn't know I bought you. Wait, never mind. This door sounds like it's going to break anytime soon. Come stop her, quick! Dad! Wait! I'm coming! No! Why did I just hear a scream?

Yesterday, my phone rang at 2:00am. It was the police. Ma'am, we have your six year old son, Tommy at the station. He walked here by himself, saying his mommy heard his baby sister. I shot out of bed. What? Tommy's in his room sleeping. And I don't have a baby sister. Ma'am, please come down to the station immediately. I ran to Tommy's room. Empty bed, front door wide open. At the police station, Tommy was wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The moment he saw me, he screamed, don't let her take me. She killed my sister. My heart stopped. The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away, too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room while Tommy sobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My Stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. Spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. Little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. This psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy's story never changed. Hours passed. The detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She. He sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She showed me the room she made all pink And pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us? But before I could answer,

You what? I panicked. Sarah wouldn't stop asking me out. So your solution was to fake date me? Ever heard of saying I'm not interested? I tried that. She didn't listen. And you thought, ah, yes, let me drag Natasha into this mess. You're my best friend. Who else was I supposed to ask? Anyone. Literally anyone. Too late. Everyone believes it now. Unbelievable. Come on, it's just for a week or two. Fine, but you owe me. How much? Fries and milkshakes every day. Rizz App tells him to say, I thought I owe you my heart. I thought I owe you my heart. That was smooth. Anyways, I got you. Why is everyone staring at me in the hallway? Probably because you're dating the most eligible bachelor in school. Cut the ego trip. Did you tell people details? Just the usual we're madly in love stuff. You're kidding. Relax, it's believable. Someone just asked me when we had our first kiss. What did you say? I panicked and said sophomore year. Nice. That makes us high school sweethearts. Jake, this isn't a Netflix romcom. It could be. No. Alright, alright, Ava. Now what? Sarah just cornered me after practice. Oh boy. What did she say? She asked, what does Ava have that I don't? And you said, better taste. Oh my god. You didn't. I did. The look on her face was priceless. You're impossible. And you're stuck with me. Someone left a Note in my locker. A love letter? No. It said, Alex deserves someone better than you. Yikes. Gee, thanks for the sympathy. I'm just saying, it's probably Sarah. She's dramatic like that. Well, congrats. Your fake girlfriend now has a nemesis. So this is fun. My mom just asked, when is Jake coming over for dinner? She knows? Of course she knows. You couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you? Actually, I didn't say anything. Then how does she know? Moms have their ways. What did you tell her? That we're busy. Lame. I love your mom's cooking. Jake, this isn't real. Doesn't mean I can't get a free meal out of it. Hey, it's a boyfriend. I've been thinking. Uh oh. Dangerous territory. What if we didn't have to pretend any

Why have you been so distant lately? It's like I'm talking to a wall. Maybe because you keep leaving me in the dust. You play with my emotions like it's a game. One day you're all lovey dovey, next day it's like I don't exist to you. What? I don't get it. When did I ever make you feel like that? Seriously? Like at the mall last weekend. I tried to hug you to be close, and you acted like I was an visible. You didn't even sit with me on the carousel. You chose Alexa instead. Oh, that. I'm sorry, my love.

Anything can be fixed with the power of my love for you. That's actually really sweet. I love you, Liv. More than you know. I don't wanna lose you over stupidity. I love you too, James. But this has to change now. It will. Movie tomorrow with the group. I'll be the boyfriend. You deserve. Okay, but you better stick to your word this time. I promise. We had such a blast last night, didn't we? That movie was a killer. Babe, why aren't you responding? Didn't you enjoy it as well? Enjoy it? How could I enjoy it when you literally ignored me for Alexa the whole time? What are you talking about? I was just being friendly. Plus, I gave you that kiss, remember? A kiss doesn't cancel out you laughing and joking with her all night. It felt like you were her date more than you were mine. I didn't mean to make you feel that way. Alexa's just easy to talk to, you know? So I'm not. Am I not funny or interesting enough for you? That's not what I meant. I'm sorry, okay? I love you, live. You mean everything to me. Save it, James. I can't do this anymore. Baby, please meet me at school tomorrow, okay? I'll prove how much you mean to me. Fine. But this is your last chance.

And I'm pretty sure she can smell my location at all times. And I'm half ass sure that she can smell my fear. You wanna hear some bubble gum bullshit? Some shit that'll really fuck with your head? The other day, I'm sleeping in bed with my toddler and my husband, and I get kicked out of the bed, okay? So I'm standing up and I'm looking at my toddler and my husband take up a whole California king. And I think, fuck this, okay? I grab my pillow, I grab my blanket, and I march my happy ass upstairs. I crank the fucking heater and I roll up in my blanket. And I'm laughing to myself because I'm thinking I'm gonna get to sleep in because she's not gonna be able to find me and she will be forced to wake up her father. I close my eyes for what feels like barely an hour, and I wake up to my toddler poking me in the fucking forehead, going, hey, I'm kind of hungry. Also, I wanna play Barbies. Could we do Barbies and breakfast maybe? Could we do that? Could you get up? Can we do that? And I'm like, waking up all groggy as fuck, holding my eyelids open, and I'm like, where's your father? And she goes, oh, He's downstairs sleeping in bed still. What? What, you mean to tell me you woke up, saw your sleeping father, and thought, hmm, I better check every other room in this house until I find my mother to wake her up instead of asking him for Barbies and breakfast? That doesn't even make sense. It's so much more effort. You could have just rolled over and woke his ass up. Instead, you searched high and low for me. It's not fair, okay? It's not fair. And being a mother isn't for the weak. Also, yeah, I'm hiding in my car. Who cares? Who cares? It's the only safe place. I need a minute. I need a minute. I love being a mom. I do. It's just. It's just kind of annoying sometimes, to be honest. To be completely fucking Frank, dude.

No, I didn't, because my daughter woke up in the middle of the night, looked me dead in the eyeball, and said, Mommy, I'm afraid of what's under the bed. And in my head, I was thinking, that's really fucking creepy. I, too, am now afraid of what's under the bed. That's not what I said, though. No, what I said was, honey, there's nothing under the bed. Just go back to sleep. Did I believe that? No. Actually, I'm pretty sure there was something under the bed, but I lied to her for her comfort. And then she asked me to check under the bed. And in my head, I was like, ain't no fucking way am I getting out of bed right now to check under it. Instead, I reassured her that there was nothing under the bed, and I told her to go back to sleep. And she tried for a minute. Her eyes fluttered. They. They, like, a little bit, and then they popped right open again. And she was looking at the TV, the TV that was turned off in our dark room. And she goes, mommy, who's that on the TV? And in my head, I'm thinking, dog, I don't fucking know. You tell me. You're the one seeing dead people. Who the fuck is that on the TV? Because I don't see it, but I'm terrified. I don't say that. No, instead, I Say, honey, the TV's turned off. There's no one on the TV. Just go back to sleep. And she falls back asleep eventually. You know who doesn't? Me. Because I'm afraid of what's under the bed now. And I'm wondering who the fuck that was on my TV. On my TV that was turned off. Who was it? And now I'm thinking, I need to fucking spray my daughter with holy water. Except I don't have holy water. What I do have is Dawn dish soap power scrub. I could spray her with that, hit her with a microfiber towel and hope that fucking works. I'm terrified right now. And I'm a little bit tired, but mostly terrified.

So imagine one of these hands is black, and then the hands come together. It felt like a sonic boom was created. This warmth entered my body, and I felt like we solved racism just right then and there. Like, it was like everything's. Everything's okay. We are. We are cool AF. We're good. That's what it felt like. Uh, what did I do for him? I rushed his crown. So crowns normally are a 10 day turnaround, and he was traveling and had some commitments, like, I gotta have that sooner. And I was like, let me make a phone call. I'll be back to you in three days. You my boom. Hand clasp. Sonic boom. Racism solved. So now I'm his ride or die, and I don't think he knows that. So black people, you want a ride or die? White person, call him your N word. It comes at a cost. It comes at a cost because now I think. I mean, I'm not Gonna say the N word? But I'm thinking about it. I'm thinking about. I shouldn't even be thinking about that, but I am thinking about it. And I know, I know I shouldn't, but. It's like, you get into a club that you're not you. You're never gonna get into normally, but someone vouches for you, so you're in there now. You're in the club. That doesn't mean you can act like a fool when you're in the club. You can't do that. You'll get kicked out of the club, never invited back. So I'm in the club, and I'm so excited. Like, I don't know if I can behave myself. So that's the cost. But, man, does it feel good. It might be the most amazing thing that's ever happened to me in my life. Definitely in my career. Definitely in my career, for sure. Oh, you're a fellow for the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry. Oh, that's a nice certificate. Have you ever had a black person call you their N word? No. Huh? Yeah. Keep working. Keep working hard. You'll get there. Trust me. Just keep working hard. It's the Pinnacle of accomplishment. I don't even care about anything else. That's all I want. I want that more. What's the only thing better than having that happen once? Have it happen twice. So I think that means I have to rush crowns for all my black patients. Is that racist? I don't care. I don't care. I'm Chasing that feeling I'm solving racism one rushed crown at a time.

He said, you need to grow up and quit acting like that. I would like to quit, but I'm currently too legit. Pretending to be a functioning adult is exhausting y'all. When I grow up, I wanna be a bear.

Yesterday, I posted a video about how my 3 year old daughter stole candy from a store. And I. I know it could have been worse. But today it was worse when she tried to steal a whole fucking baby. I have a rule in the store. While we are shopping, if you are walking, you have to have your hands on the cart. My other daughter had two hands on the cart to trick me so that her sister could go get a baby brother. This poor woman was just trying to pick out the right type of toilet paper. My sweet, innocent little daughter just comes up and kidnaps her son. The worst part about all of it. Okay, it's gonna sound horrible, but the mother and her child were black, okay? So when my daughter come running up to me with this child, she says, Mommy, Mommy, can we keep the chocolate baby? I have never been so embarrassed in my life.

Well, one he usually has the situation handled and all he does is go and shows off his ring. And if someone does not get the hint, he usually tells them to fuck off. But they're still not gonna get the hint after that. They usually do. I haven't had someone not do that. Someone's gonna be going to the morgue and it ain't gonna be me or him. Cause if someone dares to lay hands on what is mine, I'm going to hide the body in the trunk and I will join the search party hunting for them. What is mine is mine. Yes, I am overprotective of him. Yes, I am possessive and territorial of him. He's mine. I took the effort to dig him up. My partner is mine. I don't share willingly. I don't share easily. So that is the answer to my coworker's question. If anyone would like another answer on what would you do if your partner was being flirted with or someone tried to touch them, leave it in the comments. My coworker is actually curious on that one.

Do you know how untouched by violence you have to be to buck at an armed line cook? That is not confidence, that's delusion. That's I've never had my head bounced off a urinal for talking spicy during golden tea energy. I guarantee you these are the people who correct grammar in an argument. Oh, you meant you're gonna catch these hands, not your. There's an apostrophe. Yeah, cool. Spell concussion, you chode. Have you ever tried to finish a sentence mid nosebleed? Do you ever conjugated verbs while tasting pennies after blunt force trauma? I thought not. Respect isn't a virtue, it's muscle memory. And the people who don't have it have never been humbled by hands. Cause once you've been baptized by hands, you stop leaning into conversations the same way. That's right, sucker! They confuse being loud with being right, which is super annoying. They'll argue with retail workers and then leave Yelp reviews with adjectives like appalling.

You wanna know why? Cause moms won't fuck us over and make us regret every decision. Hell, girls my age, all they worry about is hot girl summer and racking up the body count. Hell, moms ain't got time for that shit. Plus, most of them are low maintenance. We don't have to go the extra mile, even if we want to, to make them happy. Hell, by what I've seen, all you gotta do is pretty much be around them and they're happy. You don't have to take them out to a fucking five star steakhouse every night shit. Just stay at home. When her kids are asleep, go fuck. And then she'll make you macaroni and cheese and give you a big ass glass of chocolate milk after.

I met my first hardcore drug users when I was only six years old. I am of course talking about Scooby Doo and Shaggy. Can we get on board with this? Part of becoming an adult is realizing those two character there's were high all of the time. And you could tell cause they were never really scared of the monsters. They were more concerned with the munchies. Like they'd see a monster like Zoinks, Scoobs, check it out, there's a vampire. Yeah, maybe he's got some Scooby snacks. And they had the dumbest ideas in the world. Watch that show as an adult. Only a stoner would have these stupid thoughts. They would be in a haunted castle in the middle of the night, pitch black dark. And hear a noise like sewing scoops. Did you hear that? Yeah. Like maybe someone's baking a cake. What are the odds someone's baking a cake in a haunted castle in the dark? Only a pothead would think like maybe they'll be cake. I told my mom at 6 years old. She got furious. She was like, you know what? Maybe they weren't high. Maybe that is the way the characters were created. I was like mom, let's be honest. Shaggy could talk to a dog. Like have you ever thought you might be high and you look at your dog and say, hey dog, I could really go for a pizza. If your Dog looks back and says, yeah, me too. Guess what? You're high.

Remember Cookie Crisp? If you told somebody today that you fed your kids chocolate chip cookies for breakfast, they will call child services. To this day, I don't know what's in a Pop Tart. I know one thing. Ain't nan strawberry in a strawberry Pop Tart. For all we know, it could be strawberry scented candle wax. But it's delicious, so we eat it. Not Nan fruit was in them loops, but we ate it like it was part of Food Pyramid. With a crazy ass mascot floating around seeing Fruit Loops everywhere. High on acid, talking about some follow me nose. I know a cokehead when I see one. Follow me nose. That is a cokehead battle cry. Tony the Tiger pushing steroids on kids. Everybody knows that. The secret to becoming a world class athlete. Frosting. Ain't no kid about to grow into a D1 player hopped up on Frosted Flakes. This nigga juicing. Shout out to everybody that thought Sunny D was orange juice growing up. That shit was neither orange nor juice. Lucky Charms. They took a box full of marshmallows, threw some kitty litter in it and said it was a balanced breakfast. And we ate it. Damn, A rabbit's foot. You was lucky they ain't cut off your feet. We had a rabbit literally turning tricks for some damn serious. What kind of message is that for kids if you don't recognize none Of these characters. It's cause you grew up with your mama buying an off brand series that was on the bottom of the shelf in the plastic bag. No shame, but the message still applies.

My brother texted, stay away from us. I replied, done. Then I withdrew my name as guarantor for their new house mortgage. I'm the family's designated adult, the one who gets late night calls for rides, the one who co signs things. My brother Robert is 29, charming, lives on impulse. His fiance, Bethany is intense, obsessed with social media. I never warmed to Bethany. She had this way of complimenting that felt like a slap. It's amazing that you're so stable and practical. Her smile never reached her eyes. Three months ago, they found their dream house in a neighborhood they couldn't afford. Their income wasn't enough for the mortgage. Robert asked me to be the guarantor, a massive 30 year financial risk. I had a lawyer draft a simple agreement with two key clauses. If they defaulted, I could take over their equity for what I paid and my guarantee was contingent on mutual respect and good faith. Any defamation would be grounds for immediate withdrawal. Robert barely glanced at. We're brothers. Good faith is a given. We signed it in front of a notary. At a family barbecue last weekend, Bethany came over, maybe tipsy, stood too close. You're always so serious. You should try to have some fun. It made me uncomfortable so I walked away. Two days later, my phone exploded with a text from Robert. Bethany had confessed I've been making her uncomfortable for Months. She claimed I cornered her, whispered she was too good for him, that she should be with a real man who could provide. The accusations were so specific, so venomous. This wasn't a misunderstanding. This was targeted character assassination. I tried calling Robert. No answer. Then the final message. I can't believe you do this to us. Bethany is a wreck. Just stay away from us. After 29 years together, my brother was gone. A strange calm settled over me. I texted back, done. My next call was to the mortgage advisor. Due to a significant personal conflict, I am formally withdrawing as guarantor. Sir, this will almost certainly lead to denial of their entire mortgage application. I am aware of the consequences. Three days later, frantic, banging on my door at ten PM Robert looked like he hadn't slept in days. What did you do? The loan is denied. You torpedoed the whole thing. You told me to stay away. I'm staying away from your finances, too. That was personal stuff. Bethany was upset. You don't ruin someone's future over a fight. A fight is arguing about who helps dad clean gutters. This, it was character assassination. And you believed her instantly? Without question. His phone buzzed. Bethany's voice, is he fixing it? Make him fix it. You have to call the bank, Robert demanded. Tell them it was a mistake. No, I'm not a light switch you can flick on and off. You don't get to treat Me like a monster in a bank. In the same week, the family pressure campaign started. Immediately, mom called. Families work through things. But Bethany launched a smear campaign, spinning stories about my growing jealousy and erratic behavior. Then a certified letter arrived from their lawyer demanding I reinstate.

When I asked what allowance, his face went white. For four months, I've been grinding three jobs, tutoring high school kids, weekend event staffing and bar shifts until 2:00am, classes until three PM, then straight to tutoring until six PM, quick dinner of instant noodles, then bar work until closing. I get home at 3:00am, study until 5, sleep for two hours, repeat, surviving on ramen packets and day old bread. When textbooks cost $400 each, I photocopy pages at the library. My friends go out Thursday nights while I'm serving drinks to businessmen who tip in singles. My bank account never goes above $200. Every dollar is calculated, $50 for groceries, $30 for laundry. I wear the same three shirts and my shoes have holes I cover with duct tape. Meanwhile, my sister Mariah floods Instagram from Paris. Designer coffee at trendy cafes, weekend trips to Monaco, new Dior dresses with captions like, mom always knows exactly what I need. Hashtag blessed, hashtag fashion life. When I begged mom for even $200 for groceries, she sighed heavily. Money is tight. Your father's practice is struggling. Paying your tuition is already stretching us. I worked harder, picked up extra shifts, skipped meals to save money. Last Friday, everything changed. I was carrying cocktails when the room started spinning. I remember reaching for the bar to steady myself, then nothing. I woke up in a hospital bed with an IV. The Doctor was stern. You collapsed from exhaustion and malnutrition. Your blood sugar was dangerously low. My bar manager visited, looking guilty, even working doubles every weekend. The rest of the month off. That meant losing $1,200 in income I desperately needed. My friend visited with groceries and made me spaghetti. While eating the first real meal I had in weeks, he said something that shattered my world. Your dad's a surgeon with a luxury car. You went to private school. How is your sister affording Paris? If money's so tight, you're working yourself into the hospital. That night, I called Mariah directly. Just checking in. How's Paris? Amazing. Mom just sent me the cutest Chanel bag for my birthday next month. My stomach dropped. How are you managing financially? Paris must be expensive. Oh, I don't worry about that. Mom transfers me about $3,000 a month plus extra whenever I need something special. $3,000 a month plus extras. While I was told there wasn't a single dollar to spare. At Sunday dinner, when dad asked about my allowance, I watched our family explode. What do you mean? Dad's voice was confused. I've been sending $2,000 every month since you started school. Mom kept cutting her pot roast, not looking up. Where is Henry's money? Dad asked mom. Silence stretched forever. I haven't sent any money to Henry. What? Why not? I've been keeping it for Mariah. She needs it more. She's studying fashion in Paris. It's expensive. She needs to Look the part. Dad's face turned white. You've been withholding Henry's allowance, letting him work himself into a hospital while secretly sending thousands to Mariah for shopping. Mariah has potential. She's special. She's delicate. Henry is exactly like you. He'll be fine. He doesn't need help. And Henry doesn't have potential. He's studying.

I remember reaching for the bar to steady myself. Then nothing. I woke up in a hospital bed with an IV. The doctor was Stern, you collapsed from exhaustion and malnutrition. Your blood sugar was dangerously low. My bar manager visited, looking guilty, even working doubles every weekend, the rest of the month off. That meant losing $1,200 in income I desperately needed. My friend visited with groceries and made me spaghetti. While eating the first real meal I'd had in weeks, he said something that shattered my world. Your dad's a surgeon with a luxury car. You went to private school. How is your sister affording Paris? If money's so tight, you're working yourself into the hospital? That night, I called Mariah directly. Just checking in. How's Paris? Amazing. Mom just sent me the cutest Chanel bag for my birthday next month. My stomach dropped. How are you managing financially? Paris must be expensive. Oh, I don't worry about that. Mom transfers me about $3,000 a month, plus extra whenever I need something special. $3,000 a month plus extras? While I was told there wasn't a single dollar to spare. At Sunday dinner, when dad asked about my allowance, I watched our family explode. What do you mean? Dad's voice was confused. I've been sending $2,000 every month since you started school. Mom kept cutting her pot roast, not looking up. Where is Henry's money? Dad asked mom. Silence stretched forever. I haven't sent any money to Henry. What? Why not? I've been keeping it for Mariah. She needs it more. She's studying fashion in Paris. It's expensive. She needs to look the Part dad's face turned white. You've been withholding Henry's allowance, letting him work himself into a hospital while secretly sending thousands to Mariah for shopping. Mariah has potential. She's special. She's delicate. Henry is exactly like you. He'll be fine. He doesn't need help. And Henry doesn't have potential. He's studying

Then he called me desperate when he found out I had already found someone better to accompany me. My sister Kira was always the golden child. I was the accident that came 11 months later. My mother kept my hospital bracelet in a drawer labeled oops until I could read it myself at age six. Favoritism was constant. Kira got new clothes every season while I wore her hand me downs. Christmas, when I turned 8, I watched her unwrap the American Girl doll I begged Santa for. My gift was a dollar store knock off with the $1 99 cent sticker still on it. When I started crying, my father said, Selena, you're too old for tears. Kira is more sensitive than you. That was the moment I Learned I had to hide my emotions to avoid disappointing them further. Middle school was worse. At my 8th grade graduation, I won three academic awards while Kira sat in the audience getting seas during the car ride home. Instead of celebrating my achievements, my parents spent the entire time discussing how Kira must feel seeing me on stage so much. My mother said, Selena, maybe next time don't look so excited when they call your name. Think about your sister's feelings. In high school, I pulled straight A's while Kira barely passed. And report cards came home, they Pinned hers to the fridge and put mine in a drawer. The day I got accepted to Northwestern with a full scholarship, I found my parents comforting Kira, who just been fired from her clothing store job for showing up late. My mother looked at my acceptance letter and said, Selena, this really isn't the time. Can't you see your sister is upset? They spent an hour consoling her for losing a minimum wage job while completely ignoring my full scholarship that would save them $200,000. That night, my Aunt Sandra told me something that changed everything. Selena, you were never an accident. Your parents did fertility treatments to give Kira a sibling. But when you turned out smarter than her, they didn't know how to handle it. Everything clicked into place. The constant comparisons, the downplaying of my achievements, the way they seemed annoyed when I succeeded. College became my escape. I met Matt there, someone who valued my intelligence instead of feeling threatened by it. For the first time, I experienced what it felt like to be someone's first choice. When he proposed during our senior year, I cried from relief as much as joy. Someone finally chose me first and meant it. Three weeks before my wedding, my father called Lena. Kira scheduled her housewarming party for the same day as your wedding. Your mother and I think we should support her instead. You'll have Matt's family there. My heart shattered, dad, she's known my wedding date. For eight months. We'll try to stop by the reception if we can. When I told Matt's father, Jim, what happened, his eyes filled with tears. Selena, it would be the honor of my life to walk you down that aisle. His voice cracked with emotion. I've watched you for four years and you're already the daughter I never had. Wedding day arrived. Jim was waiting at the church doors in his best navy suit.

The next morning, Laura and Charles appeared and took me away. My parents didn't pack my things. I left with clothes on my back and an old toy. I thought everyone grew up afraid of their mother.

Nathan, tomorrow you're going to live with other people, he said with no emotion. Laura and Charles gave me what no one had tried to give me, security. Charles sold tools door to door. Then they started their own business. I, I helped however I could. The garage became a shop, then a warehouse, then a distribution center. At 21, I graduated with a business degree. Charles cried like a baby. Two years later, they went away for a weekend. An out of control truck hit them on a blind curve. It was instantaneous. They left me everything, the house, investments, the entire company. I grew the business, opened branches, hired over 100 employees. Last night security called me. There's a man here, says his name is Brad, says he's your father. When I went to the lobby, there he was, flumped, shoulders, unkempt beard, cheap clothes. Behind him were two exhausted women and four small children. Nathan, my son, he said, He had never called me that. Your mother left, ran off with another man. These are my daughters. They came back home with two kids each, no husbands, nothing. One of the children looked at me and asked quietly, are you Uncle Nathan? I had never been an uncle to anyone. You have so much now, Brad continued. We just need help until we get back on our feet. Then he said something that froze me. I want you to do for them what Charles and Laura did for you.

Gavin Ramsey, the teenage perpetrator, invaded 98 year old Margaret Douglas's residence in Wadsworth under cover of darkness last April. He used his phone to record her sleeping, then murdered her and desecrated her corpse while leaving biological evidence at the scene. During court proceedings, Ramsey's family revealed he had endured childhood abuse and been prescribed the antidepressant Zoloft during adolescence, factors they claimed contributed to the horrific crimes. Margaret Douglas's loved ones tearfully described her vivacious personality and passion for life, emphasizing how Ramsey destroyed her dream of reaching 100 years old. The presiding judge sentenced Ramsey to life imprisonment without Parole. His mother accepted partial responsibility in court, admitting she authorized his Zoloft prescription and alleging the medication altered his behavior. Is a life sentence too severe for a 17 year old? Share your perspective on this punishment in the comments.

She was pronounced dead at the scene and an autopsy later revealed she died from malnutrition and dehydration. At the time of her death, Mary weighed just 8 pounds.

And trigger warning guys, what they did to him was absolutely terrible. They said as many as 15 suspects wearing ski masks attacked Lord in a group, and his injuries were so bad that he later died in a hospital. And this was all apparently over a stolen gold chain. But what they did to him after they beat him was absolutely terrifying. So the 17 year old apparently responsible for Preston's death, Talon Renner, punched him in the face four times before all of them gathered around and started kicking him on the ground. And once he was pleading for his life and unable to move, one of the suspects danced on his body and another one started humping him as they recorded and laughed. And after they Learned the news, Talon's Snapchat messaged one of his friends saying, I accidentally killed a kid. I guess I'm just too strong. And the fact that this is how he acted after he Learned he took someone's life shows that he had no remorse about it. So far, they have charged seven suspects with first degree murder and kidnapping, and they're all being held on a million dollar bond. Rest in peace to Preston Lord. And as always, I'll keep you guys updated.

In a shocking and horrifying case that gripped the nation, Michelle Blair, a mother of four from Detroit, Michigan, murdered two of her own children and kept their bodies in a freezer for nearly three years. The gruesome discovery was made on March 24th, 2015 when Blair was evicted from her apartment due to unpaid rent. During the eviction process, court officials stumbled upon a deep freezer in Blair's living room containing the remains of her two children, Steven Barry and Stoney Blair. The police were immediately notified and it was determined that the children had been dead for at least three years. The medical examiner ruled their deaths as homicides. Michelle Blair was arrested and brought to trial where she confessed to the murders of Steven and Stoney. Um, to my understanding, to get a trial is to get to the truth, right? I'm already saying that I did it. I'm freely giving myself and accepting life in prison. My son is worth that to me. So what I don't understand is from what I heard today, why the prosecutors are dragging their feet. If I'm already giving myself to you, like, hey, I did this, what's the problem? You get what I'm saying? I'm not gonna come back like, I didn't understand my rights. I'm not.

Madeline Sophia Soto was born on February 22nd, 2,011 to her mother, Jennifer Soto, and to her father, Tyler. Parents were not together, but Madeline still had a very good and close relationship with her father. Eventually, Jennifer began dating 37 year old Stephen Sterns. The two were dating for some time, and then Jennifer and Stephen moved in together along with Jennifer's daughter Madeline, and the three of them were now living together in Kissimmee, Florida. On Sunday, February 25th, 2024, Madeline celebrated her 13th birthday. Well, technically her birthday was on Thursday the 22nd, but they chose to celebrate on a Sunday. Madeline had a birthday party with some of her friends and with her family members, but unfortunately her mother Jennifer was not able to attend due to work. However, her mom's boyfriend, Stefan was able to make it to the party towards the end. Later that night, Jennifer asked her boyfriend Stephen if he was able to take Madeline to school the next day because she was really exhausted from work. Stephen agreed to that plan and that was it. So the next day on Monday, February 26th, Stephen says that he dropped Madeline off at this church, which was just a couple of blocks away from the school. He said he dropped Madeline off there somewhere between 8:25 and 8:40 in the morning, and that he Saw Madeline get out of the car, rummage through her backpack, and then head into the direction of the school. Then he claims that he went back home. He kind of just hung out, did some errands, and was pretty much home the rest of the day. At around four PM, Jennifer shows up to Madeline's middle school to pick her up, but that's when she realized.

Thirty four year old Robert Fisher was sentenced to 20 years to life behind bars for the rape and murder of three year old Josephina Cunningham. Fisher had forced the girl to consume her mother's medication. He then attacked her and tried to cover up what he had done. Fisher had befriended the child's mother and the child was left in his care on the day she died. During the sentencing, District Attorney Antonia Edwards said Fisher used Clorox wipes to try to conceal his crimes, scrubbing the child's face so hard he rubbed off the pigment. He used these Clorox wipes throughout her body, even placing them inside of her body. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison after taking a plea deal which was only offered to him so the family would not have to sit through a trial and learn the horrible details of his crime. Fortunately, he was recently found dead whilst in prison. The prison refused to reveal the cause of death which is expected to be revealed by the medical examiners.

When their father, Jamil Penn returned home, he smelled the smell of grilled meat and thought it was his wife cooking. When he walked into the kitchen, he realized that something terrible had happened. His two children are in the oven. By the time he rescued them, it was already too late. Jamil trembled and dialed 9 1 1 to report the incident. The police arrived at the scene and immediately arrested their mother, 24 year old Lamora Williams. Even more heartbreaking is that investigators are no longer able to identify two children. Lamora told the police that she doesn't know who killed her child. Then she blamed her cousin for the crime. And finally she said it was her sister who killed the children. She is uncertain and provided false information. Lemora is charged with two counts of murder. But in court, Lemora's sister claimed that Lemora had suffered from serious mental health problems since childhood. She even tried to end her own life. After psychological evaluation, it was confirmed that Lamora William has cognitive impairment. The final judge sentenced her to 5 years in prison. Do you think this is a fair judgment?

Thirty four year old Robert Fisher was sentenced to 20 years to life behind bars for the rape and murder of three year old Josephina Cunningham. Fisher had forced the girl to consume her mother's medication, then attacked her and tried to cover up what he had done. Fisher had befriended the child's mother and the child was left in his care on the day she died.

Tiffany Lucas appeared in court Monday looking stone faced and cold. Last month Tiffany Lucas took the lives of her two sons, Jaden, 9, and Maurice, 6. She kept a serious expression throughout her appearance as she pleaded not guilty to two counts of capital murder for the boys. The boys aunt drove up from Georgia for the court hearing and said she's determined not to miss a single court date. I found out about this court date Saturday. I got on the highway at 3 o'clock in the morning because I'll be at every court date. The boys were laid to rest separately but Maurice's aunt said the coroner messed up. My nephew had his visitation. We we got Jaden's body instead of Maurice's. Tiffany's lack of emotion was noticed by everyone in the courtroom, including Miss Baker. She just looks like she doesn't have a care in the world. I think her sitting in jail for the rest of her life is a cakewalk. Prosecutors pushed for a two million dollar bond without any objection from Tiffany's attorney. I do not believe she needs to be out on bond under any circumstances and that bond essentially ensures that. do back in court in January to establish who her attorney will be. Then do back in March to set a trial date. Miss Booker wants only one outcome from this trial and it's simple for her to be put to death.

The 49 defensive wounds indicate that Tristan Bailey was conscious, she was aware, and that she was doing everything she could to fend off this attack. She suffered a painful, horrifying death from someone that she trusted. Her screams were most likely stifled by her own suffocating lungs.

No! How did Anthony Blackwell manage to find Hannah's home address so precisely? After closely reviewing Hannah's online content, he became concerned by the children's reaction in the pursuit of justice. Anthony used her husband Braxton's name conducting an online search. He eventually found a LinkedIn profile for a Braxton Hyatt in Utah. Anthony noted that Braxton had expressed interest in real estate after completing his studies, so he decided to look for real estate listings connected to his name. Anthony found a listing under Hyatt Realty and recognized Hannah as the office manager. Upon further investigation, they compared the features in the listing photo like cabinets, granite countertops, and chandeliers, details visible in Hannah's videos. Anthony stressed that they had blocked out sensitive information to avoid doxing. In addition to the CPS investigation, Hannah has also been reported to the state nursing board for alleged violations of ethical policies. Now, nurse Hannah, count your days.

He also told authorities that he remembered taking the baby to the basement, but that he blacked out after that. You see he had been smoking and drinking the night before and that was his excuse. Thankfully, Benjamin was convicted of all charges and sentenced to life in prison without mercy, as you can see right here. But for some people, that just wasn't enough. And like I said at the beginning of this video, a petition was created which asked the government to publicly hang Benjamin. And this petition before it was shut down gathered over 50,000 signatures. I mean, this truly is one of the worst things that I've ever covered here on my TikTok. And personally, I don't think that life in prison is enough for this guy. I mean, the pain that poor Emily went through before she was eventually killed, it's just heartbreaking on every single level. And I just hope and pray that the other prisoners that are in there with Benjamin find out or already have found out exactly what he did to land himself in there.

On March 9, 2013, in Springfield, New York, a 16 year old boy named Dylan Shoemaker was asked to take care of his girlfriend's two young sons while she was working at a restaurant. His girlfriend, Ashley Smith, finished her shift, and when she returned home, she found her 23 month old son, Austin Smith, completely lifeless on the floor. Dylan was immediately arrested by the police for killing Austin, and when the doctor examined Austin's body, it was revealed that the cause of death was a severe brain injury resulting from the back and forth movement of his head caused by blows. Dylan at the trial kept pleading to the judge that he did not mean to hurt Austin and tearfully apologized, expressing his love for Austin and regret for what had happened. But that quickly went out the window as Dylan later admitted to hitting the child multiple times and eventually placing a pillow over the child's head and repeatedly punching him. And why did he commit such a violent crime? According to Dylan, Austin was crying and was disturbing his baby brother, so he placed the pillow on Austin's head and punched it to stop the crying.

Thirty four year old Robert Fisher was sentenced to 20 years to life behind bars for the rape and murder of three year old Josephina Cunningham. Fisher had forced the girl to consume her mother's medication. He then attacked her and tried to cover up what he had done. Fisher had befriended the child's mother and the child was left in his care on the day she died. During the sentencing, District Attorney Antonia Edwards said Fisher used Clorox wipes to try to conceal his crimes, scrubbing the child's face so hard he rubbed off the pigment. He used these Clorox wipes throughout her body, even placing them inside of her body. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison after taking a plea deal which was only offered to him so the family would not have to sit through a trial and learn the horrible details of his crime. Fortunately, he was recently found dead whilst in prison. The prison refused to reveal the cause of death which is expected to be revealed by the medical examiners.

She was pronounced dead at the scene and an autopsy later revealed she died from malnutrition and dehydration. At the time of her death, Mary weighed just 8 pounds. Her cheeks were hollow, her eyes sunken, and her ribs clearly visible. Investigators Learned that Mary had never seen a doctor.

Two years later, Seth Welch was convicted of first degree murder and child abuse. He was sentenced to life in prison without Parole. A year later, Tatiana Fusari was found guilty on the same charges.

His girlfriend Ashley Smith finished her shift and when she returned home she found her 23 month old son Austin Smith completely lifeless on the floor. Dylan was immediately arrested by the police for killing Austin. And when the doctor examined Austin's body, it was revealed that the cause of death was a severe brain injury resulting from the back and forth movement of his head caused by blows. Dylan at the trial kept pleading to the judge that he did not mean to hurt Austin and tearfully apologized expressing his love for Austin and regret for what had happened. But that quickly went out the window as Dylan later admitted to hitting the child multiple times and eventually placing a pillow over the child's head and repeatedly punching him. And why did he commit such a vile crime? According to Dylan, Austin was crying and was disturbing his baby brother so he placed the pillow on.

And when the doctor examined Austin's body it was revealed that the cause of death was a severe brain injury resulting from the back and forth movement of his head caused by blows. Dylan at the trial kept pleading to the judge that he did not mean to hurt Austin and tearfully apologized expressing his love for Austin and regret for what had happened. But that quickly went out the window as Dylan later admitted to hitting the child multiple times and eventually placing a pillow over the child's head and repeatedly punching him. And why did he commit such a vile crime? According to Dylan, Austin was crying and was disturbing his baby brother. So he placed the pillow on Austin's head and punched it to stop the crying.

The girl then returned to the house where she picked up another brother in her arms and attempted to flee with him. Dorman allegedly intercepted them as they.

In addition to the lack of DNA evidence, forensic evidence, the prosecutor who brought this case in the first place believes that Marcellus is innocent and that his rights were violated. The family of the victim does not want him executed. And people have been begging and imploring the state of Missouri and Governor Mike Parsons to step in, and they won't. And so today was the last ditch effort with the United States Supreme Court. And it just came down a few minutes ago that the US Supreme Court also will not step in. Of the nine justices, the three that were appointed by democratic presidents all voted to block the execution, whereas the other six who are appointed by Republican presidents voted for it to proceed as planned. Y'all, this is truly a miscarriage of justice. An innocent man being put to death for a crime he did not commit, being executed for a crime where the prosecutor has admitted that he's likely innocent and where the victim's family doesn't want him put to death. That is not justice and it goes against everything that the American justice system is supposed to stand for. It is beyond unfair. There is nothing we can do about it. And as far as I'm concerned, the state of Missouri.

Madeline Sophia Soto was born on February 22nd, 2,011 to her mother Jennifer Soto and to her father, Tyler. Parents were not together, but Madeline still had a very good and close relationship with her father. Eventually, Jennifer began dating 37 year old Stephen Sterns. The two were dating for some time and then Jennifer and Stephen moved in together along with Jennifer's daughter Madeline, and the three of them were now living together in Kissimmee, Florida. On Sunday, February 25th, 2024, Madeline celebrated her 13th birthday. Well, technically her birthday was on Thursday, the 22nd, but they chose to celebrate on a Sunday. Madeline had a birthday party with some of her friends and with her family members. But unfortunately, her mother Jennifer was not able to attend due to work. However, her mom's boyfriend, Stefan was able to make it to the party towards the end. Later that night, Jennifer asked her boyfriend Stephen if he was able to take Madeline to school the next day because she was really exhausted from work. Stephen agreed to that plan and that was it. So the next day on Monday, February 26th, Stefan says that he dropped Madeline off at this church, which was just a couple of blocks away from the school. He said he dropped Madeline off there somewhere between 8:25 and 8:40 in the morning and that he Saw Madeline get out of the car, rummage through her backpack and then head into the direction of the school. Then he claims that he went back home. He kind of just hung out, did some errands.

This case made national headlines last year because a young girl had to travel from Ohio to Indiana to undergo an abortion due to restrictions imposed by the Supreme Court after the ruling that overturned Roe versus Wade. At the time of the surgical procedure, the girl had already turned 10 years old. Fuentes, a 28 year old Guatemalan immigrant, pleaded guilty to the charges and even though he received a life sentence, he might qualify for Parole after 25 years in prison. The prosecution explained that the girl's mother didn't object to the recommended sentence. The judge criticized the agreement as a bitter pill to swallow because of the possibility that Fuentes could eventually be released from prison. It's worth noting that the doctor who performed the abortion was reprimanded and fined for carrying out the procedure. What do you think about the sentence? Do you believe justice was served? Let me know in the comments and thank you for watching.

His girlfriend, Ashley Smith, finished her shift, and when she returned home, she found her 23 month old son, Austin Smith, completely lifeless on the floor. Dylan was immediately arrested by the police for killing Austin, and when the doctor examined Austin's body, it was revealed that the cause of death was a severe brain injury resulting from the back and forth movement of his head caused by blows. Dylan at the trial kept pleading to the judge that he did not mean to hurt Austin and tearfully apologized, expressing his love for Austin and regret for what had happened. But that quickly went out the window as Dylan later admitted to hitting the child multiple times and eventually placing a pillow over the child's head and repeatedly punching him.

Fisher had forced the girl to consume her mother's medication. He then attacked her and tried to cover up what he had done. Fisher had befriended the child's mother and the child was left in his care on the day she died. During the sentencing, District Attorney Antonia Edwards said Fisher used Clorox wipes to try to conceal his crimes, scrubbing the child's face so hard he rubbed off the pigment. He used these Clorox wipes throughout her body, even placing them inside of her body. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison after taking a plea deal which was only offered to him so the family would not have to sit through a trial and learn the horrible details of his crime. Fortunately, he was recently found dead whilst in prison. The prison refused to reveal the cause of death which is expected to be revealed by the medical examiners.

Oh my god. Oh my god. A 17 year old boy admitted to breaking into a home, beating and raping a 98 year old woman while leaving his DNA inside her body. Gavin Ramsey, the teenage perpetrator, invaded 98 year old Margaret Douglas's residence in Wadsworth under cover of darkness last April. He used his phone to record her sleeping, then murdered her, decorated her corpse while leaving biological evidence at the scene. During court proceedings, Ramsey's family revealed he had endured childhood abuse and been prescribed the antidepressant Zoloft during adolescence, factors they claimed contributed to the horrific crimes. Margaret Douglas's loved ones tearfully described her vivacious personality and passion for life, emphasizing how Ramsey destroyed her dream of reaching 100 years old. The presiding judge sentenced Ramsey to life imprisonment without Parole. His mother accepted partial responsibility in court, admitting she authorized his Zoloft prescription and alleging the medication altered his behavior.

He then jumped out of a window which was three stories high and made a run for it, but was apprehended Just 45 minutes later.

I'm not changing my kids diaper when they pee. I've never done that. Do you know how expensive diapers are? Which many allege can cause life ending infections and diseases. And it's alleged if the kid doesn't get hurt from that, he might pass from freezing or ammonia. As nurse Hannah records herself in eight degree weather saying she won't buy a 35 dollar jacket for her son. Sorry, but I can't spend thirty.

The 49 defensive wounds indicate that Tristan Bailey was conscious, she was aware, and that she was doing everything she could to fend off this attack. She suffered a painful, horrifying death from someone that she trusted. Her screams were most likely stifled by her own suffocating lungs.

These seven guys have all been charged with first degree murder. They are part of the Gilbert Goons gang who are known for basically terrorizing people. So it's recently been released that 17 year old jock Talon Runner was literally bragging about what he did and that his millionaire father tried to hide evidence, tried to put blame onto other kids and even attempted to flee to Mexico to avoid his son having to face any kind of justice. So according to reports, he sent a text message to Taylor Sherman who was another one of the suspects and he said I might have hospitalized that kid. I hit him pretty hard. Then he later showed a video of the beating to his friends and said, oh, I put that kid on life support. And y'all in that video it shows one unnamed boy dancing on Preston and others appeared to be humping him as he was laying there on the ground unconscious and losing his life. He even.

And the petition gathered thousands of signatures. This is 33 year old Benjamin Taylor from West Virginia. And in 2,016, he would commit one of the most sickening crimes I've ever read about. Back in 2,016, Benjamin was living with his girlfriend, a woman named Amanda Adkins. At the time, Amanda had recently given birth only nine months ago to her baby daughter, Emily. Emily was a beautiful young girl. And I wanna warn you. All right now, the details that we're about to discuss are some of the most disturbing I've ever covered. So in October of 2016, Benjamin had only been living with his girlfriend Amanda for about a month. And on the morning of Emily's death, at around 4 30 am, Amanda woke up and went downstairs to search for her baby. When she went downstairs, she saw Benjamin Taylor with his pants unzipped, sitting in the dark. Amanda then noticed that her nine month old daughter's limp body was lying nearby on a pile of sheets and laundry.

One, after going out of town for the weekend, I dropped her off at her friend's house, which was an hour away from where I lived at the time. I told her I had to get back home to get ready for work the next day. She was begging me to stay and hang out some more, but I kept saying I had to get home. After about 15 minutes, I went to go to my car to leave. She hopped onto the hood of my car and refused to get off. After 10 more minutes of trying to talk her down, I gave up, got into my car, locked the doors, tilted the seat back and acted like I was taking a nap. She sat on my hood for another 20 minutes or so before it started to rain. That's what finally got her off of my car. Fine, go home, see if I care or something whiny like that. And she stormed off into her friend's house, never contacted her again. 2 her Rex just happened to be walking outside the restaurant we were at and she invited him in to sit at our table and have dinner with us. I protested, but I had to take a leak and the food was arriving, so I went to the bathroom. When I came back, the food date and dates ex had all disappeared. The time between this dude sitting At our table, the food arriving and me coming back from the bathroom was less than 5 minutes. 3. I have a very common last name. She had the same last name. The date went well. She said she couldn't go out with me on a second date, though, because it felt too weird. She explained that both her father and her brother also have the same first name as me, so all three of us have the exact same first and last name. I was like, whoa, yeah, that would be weird for me too. And we actually ended up staying pretty good friends. After 4, her apartment looked like it was ransacked by wolves. I'm not even exaggerating. This was a city apartment, so I'm quite sure there were no wolves. Most of the furniture was knocked over, boxes everywhere. No clear delineation between laundry, food and garbage. 5. She was one of the cutest girls I met online and we had a nice dinner. Then she asked if I wanted to meet up with her friends for more drinks down the street. I thought that was fine. It seemed like a good sign she wanted to keep hanging out. However, she didn't say another word to me the rest of the night. Once we met up with them, I just sat and listened to their conversation for an hour, then awkwardly left. 6, she ordered an obnoxious amount of expensive food while I barely ate one order. She then passed me the Bill thinking I was dumb, flagged the waiter and asked them to rewrite the order as separate bills, paid for mine and left her there. 7. He chewed with his mouth open and talked with a mouthful of food. He chugged his drink and then asked if I was going to finish mine. It was half full and I planned on finishing it. I was so grossed out that I let him finish mine so the date would end quicker. 8. We were at a restaurant that he visits a lot, so he knew the workers well and was friendly with the bartender who seemed interested in him. Halfway through the date, after talking to the bartender a few times, he flat out asked her on a date in front of me. She was a little confused since he was there with me but said yes. I was sitting there like, um, okay, this is awkward. Before she left to go take care of other customers, he goes, hahaha, I'm just messing with you. You're definitely not my type. And she looked so sad and upset. She was such a sweet and gorgeous girl. So that was super confusing. When she walked away, he was like, I only like girls like you. not sure if he was trying to prove to me that other girls are into him or just messing with someone to mess with them. But I hated it so much. 9. She was absolutely horrible to the wait staff, just a straight up dismissive, entitled person to the girl who had to serve us. I power through the meal, left that girl a 75% tip for the trouble and never called that woman again.

I once had an ex come to me in the middle of the night saying she wanted to run away with me. Everything she did was monitored by her family. So to appear out of nowhere was a huge surprise by itself. During that time, I realised how vulnerable she was and how much she loved and needed me in ways that no relationship should hopefully ever have to experience. And I couldn't have ever conceived in my wildest dreams as a random boy growing up in the Pacific Northwest, this was literally, I have no future with my family and I am a commodity to my family. The next day, her uncle came to my parents door. They didn't know where I lived, so probably a tracking app or something similar. She was taken away and sent to India after they realized she was in a relationship with a boy that they hadn't first approved of. I'd send her a bedtime story or a few paragraphs of love and affirmation every few days when she got back. We tried, but she was changed and defeated and broke up. 2. I was in the hospital after emergency surgery complications from a C section the week before. My now ex husband wouldn't answer my calls. Finally, my doctor called from the hospital phone and he answered. She told him what was happening and He said, call me if she doesn't make it and hung up. Later, after surgery, when I was in the most pain of my entire life and scared out of my mind, I called him. He answered and just sat in silence for a minute listening to me cry. Then he said to me, what have I told you about calling me when you're crying? And hung up. Didn't answer the phone for me again for almost a week. That marriage did not last a long time. 3. My ex once casually mentioned that they don't believe in apologizing because they never do anything wrong. That one sentence changed everything. I realized I'd never get accountability or real empathy from them. 4, I had an ex who I thought was totally normal until the first time I was with her in front of her grandparents. She was so rude and then told me afterward that she feels like the elderly are a waste and a drain on families in society. It didn't last long after that. Five, my ex once told me that he hoped my father would pass so I could see what it's like when things aren't handed to you on a silver platter. He said it was easier for me because my dad worked abroad and apparently that meant I had some sort of special advantage in life. I left him after that. 6, my ex partner said that I was too emotional to be around after I found out he dropped my elderly dog off at the vets and told them he was abandoned and put him down. My energy was chaotic after he manipulated me into leaving my house with my children so he could move back in with his new girlfriend two months after we split. 7, you need glasses. She was right. 8, my ex told me that the Dinosaur bones were placed by the creator as a test of faith and there was nothing I could say that would convince him otherwise. Then I realized that any potential children I had with him would likely be taught this by their father. 9, broke up in July. He said he'd pay me back and he still hasn't. Ten, my ex was feeling under the weather and was telling me he needed to get over the counter medication and he had no idea what to get. I was a nurse and recommended something, including how and when he should take it. He scoffed. You're a nurse, a doctor's assistant, not even a pharmacist. I realized he didn't respect me or nurses at all. We broke up a month later. 11, my boyfriend at the time proudly declared that he'd never read a book cover to cover. He was 27. Damn shame.

Friend's mom was sort of weird. She was usually in her bedroom on her computer unless she was in the living room demanding us to paint her nails. Anyways, the rule was to eat before you got there because you wouldn't be fed while there. If you're there while they have dinner, you sit in the living room or my friend's bedroom and wait. Weirdly, this extended to breakfast than any other meal had while I was there, no matter how long I was there. Anyways, I figured out by age 8 that I could go three days max without eating before I passed out and got sent home. 2. I slept over a friend's house in grade school. One time he prepared us a bowl of cereal the next morning for breakfast, not thinking anything of my behavior. I didn't finish the milk. I just never used to. I don't know. He was like, are you are you going to finish that? Me? I don't think so. Him? Does that matter? He panicked. Absolutely panicked. he put it down the toilet before his parents came back into the room. I don't know what the rule was exactly, but based on his reaction, I still feel bad about it. I was like 8. And didn't think now that I'm older I realize his family probably didn't have much and he didn't want them to see anything being wasted 3 the family would just put all the plates on the floor for the dog to lick clean before putting them back in the cupboard 4 when I was around 8 I went to a friend's house for a playdate slash dinner after school when I asked for a drink her mom gave me a baby bottle with squash in it I laughed but she didn't laugh back my friend took her own bottle and started drinking I asked the mom if I could please have a cup instead but she told me no and that children drink from bottles in their house never went there again. 5 I I went to see a college friend over the summer stayed the night her parents weren't home when I got there and we went into the living room to talk there were 4 recliners no couch or other chairs she sat in one recliner I sat in another she asked what are you doing and informed me I was sitting in her dad's chair the remaining chairs belonged to her mom and brother where was I supposed to sit on the floor? 6 they yelled at me for not letting the cat that was walking around on the table eat from my plate I love cats but what in the world apparently gently nudging the cat Away from my food was interfering with the freedom of another sentient being. I was 12. I think I was pretty freaked out. Seven, when I was a kid, my friend's dad made his kids line up on the couch and just sit there silently while they watch TV and sip. If you were visiting, you had to do it too. When my mom heard about it, I wasn't allowed to go over there when he was home. My mom knew a weirdo's behavior when she saw it. Eight, I had a friend who instead of washing the dishes after a meal, just put them straight back in the cupboard. I thought his parents would freak out, but it turns out it was just something they did in their house. Whenever I went over, I always made sure to eat beforehand. 9, my friend must ask his father before he is allowed to eat anything in their house. One time our group of friends wanted to go out on a Friday night. We asked if he could come and our friend said he was grounded. We asked him what he did this time and he responded, I ate a bowl of cereal when my dad wasn't home. Probably the saddest thing I've ever heard someone get grounded for. And if I went over to eat dinner with them, I was given the options of water, bottled water, mineral water or milk. I would say milk, but apparently when you say Milk, that translates to a glass of water. 11. Don't put keys on the table. Superstition that supposedly brings bad luck. I guess I have terrible luck. Been doing it all my life.

One. One of those self serve yogurt places opened up shop in a crappy mall. To get people in, they put stacks of coupons out in offices near them for a free small yogurt. They neglected to put an expiration date on any of them. I gathered all of them that were at my office and even found some in a handful of places near the yogurt place. I've been eating free yogurt for the last 20 months. Two. In the final semester of my senior year in high school, I decided to take a class called Physics 2. I like the first physics class I took. I thought that this would be a fun class to go out on. Wrong. It was basically AP Physics. I was in way over my head. At the end of the semester, I had a D minus going into the final. Our final project was about buoyancy. The task was to build a boat that could support you and your partner out of nothing but cardboard, glue, and 20 inches of duct tape. If you could paddle to the end of a pool and back with you and your partner in the boat, you would get an A on that aspect of the project. Then my teacher made the mistake of offering an extra incentive. For every length of the pool you could go beyond that without sinking, you'd get 40 extra credit points, extra Credit was my only hope. We went out and found the sturdiest cardboard we could find. We carefully folded, glued, and cut the cardboard into a canoe type of boat. It looked great. The day finally came. The entire class brought their boats out and we started. Most people made it to the end of the pool before their boats started to disintegrate. We go in and start paddling. We make it to the end and paddle back, then out and back again and again and again. We crossed the pool 60 times before our teacher made us stop. We did not sink. We both earn 2,400 extra credit points. I went from a D minus to an A on the very last final I ever had in high school. True story and one of my greatest days. Three. I earn double points on my credit card through gas and grocery purchases. So when I plan to buy something, say at Lowe's, or go out to eat, I go to the grocery store and buy a gift card. Double points for the gift card and at least double fuel points through the grocery store. 4. Some news magazines was asking college students to send out subscription forms by email to all their friends. For each 25 emails you sent, you would get a ten dollar Amazon gift card. Turns out they didn't need to be real emails. I made about 100 dollars before they told me to stop. Five. There Was a McDonald's near my college, and in it was an ATM. If you use the ATM and got a receipt, it would come with a coupon for a buy one get one free large sandwich. I'd swipe my card, hit cancel, and a receipt would print out showing the cancellation. I would then find someone in line buying a large sandwich and hand it over to them. Free sandwiches for about eight months until it finally went away. 6 when our whole Algebra 2 class figured out how grading on a curve works, we statistically used it to our advantage. Average grade on our finals was a 52, so the whole class passed without really even trying on it. Seven some games had a deal involving discounted purchases for trading in games. They also had bargain games for $2. You can see where this is going. 8 at a very old local hometown cemetery, it turns out that people who bought the original family plots have free grave openings and grave closings included in the deed. So now, generations later, families can't be charged for grave digging at the time of funerals if the family is still in possession of the original deeds. 9.

One, I have to give pretty bad news on a frequent basis. Most people know it's coming. During my last week in residency, I had to tell a mother that her daughter wasn't going to make it. She came in talking the night before and had surgery for a life threatening problem. We thought she would make it. After halfway through the day, her vitals and labs took a nose dive and it was obvious that our efforts had only temporized her, but we lost. She was intubated and peaceful, but she was young and had two small kids. We have all seen the TV drama style screams, pounding on the table, begging for someone to do something, sobbing. When it's reality, it's so much harder. Her mom was crying on the floor asking me to take her organs to save her daughter. I'm not emotional, but that day wrecked me. I went to the bar after with my attending and we didn't talk. I try not to think about it. 2 er DOC, I just had a young lady brought in. She was only 22. Her brother came as we were coding her chest compressions. We had done everything and there was no bringing her back. I asked if he wanted to be in the room when we stopped and he said yes. His reaction was heartbreaking. Screamed and cried and then Picked up her body and whispered in her ear, I love you so much, you're my best friend. And just held her and kept saying, I love you. All the staff had to take a moment after that. I'll never forget them. 3, telling a very young patient that their condition, which was assumed to be curable through surgery, was in fact not so because it had spread to the brain. It was a rare condition that rarely spreads and that rarely affects younger people. Some people get all the terrible luck in the world. The patient was remarkably stoic, but one of the parents lost it. The tears, wailing, pleading and breakdown aren't anything I'll forget. The rage against the system, the accusations, I must be wrong, and then the pleading and tears again. I think it's the fact I took their hope away from them. There is no happy ending to this story, but I'm the one who had to tell them. Years later, I can still see their face and grief. It's burnt into my memory. And it took a while to accept that perhaps trying so hard to forget would disrespect the patient's memory. I'm trained to deliver bad news and do it regularly. This one remains one of the only times where a case utterly emotionally broke me. Four, a patient of mine I hadn't seen in forever came to emerge because he couldn't manage at home, was too weak and losing weight. Blue collar Guy, I took one look at the 50 pound weight loss on him and knew, DOC, I think I'm on the way out. He said, not going to lie to you. I'm worried about that too, I said. Five, not a doctor, but a midwife. Whenever a pregnant patient comes in with reduced movement, I hold my breath until we find the Houdini's heartbeat. But sometimes it's not there. The gut wrenching cry of a parent being that there is no heartbeat is unmistakable. It gets me every time. 6. I told a woman that her husband wasn't going to make it and I didn't know why and probably couldn't do anything to prevent it. She thanked me and later sent a card after her husband passed. I hope she's doing okay. 7. Nurse here. I once stood in the hall and listened while a surgeon told a 22 year old girl that after weeks of trying, the only option left was to amputate her leg. The sound the girl made will never leave me. 8. Probably the one that stands out is telling a young dad that his wife and baby passed in a road transport accident. I think it was the whimpering, soft crying that got me got out of critical care. After too many of those types of situations. It was wearing me down. 9. Patience. Mom, are you telling me that I am going to lose my son today? Me? Yes.

I know you guys want to be inclusive and all but I always feel behind on all the letters you add to LGBT. So is it fine I just say LGBT plus? This is not meant to not be inclusive. I'm all for LGBT plus but sometimes it gets a bit too many letter for me personally. So will I offend you guys if I only say LGBT plus or are you guys fine with it? 2 to trans women also English is my third language so I may be be offending if so my apologies. Many CIS women are modest or shy about their bodies while men can whip out their shirt and not be a wit embarrassed. Does your relationship to your body change after like transition or when you came to the realization that you are trans? Again, I don't mean to be offensive just curious. Also, we've started putting pronouns in our email signatures at work and I've seen a few people put she, they or he they and I'm curious why I'm sure each person is different but I wonder why they are okay with a gendered pronoun but then also want to be called they. Anyone here? You, she, they or he, they and could give me some insight. 3. What should I say to someone who comes out to me saying, um, okay Or that's nice sounds like I'm dismissing them but trying to ask questions or engage in conversation about it seems intrusive. 4 is it okay to use adjacent urinal slash talk at the urinals if you two are dating or married? 5. What does non binary mean? I'm from Italy and I've never met someone who came out as non binary or even transgender my brother met a guy once and he my brother said he looked gender fluid gender fluid is the only term used here nobody talks about non binary I know that non binary means that you don't identify with one gender specifically I guess but I really really don't get it. 6 would people get offended if I just use the word they for literally everything? I've accidentally had it ingrained in my brain so unless they literally tell me what their pronouns are I will use they hey look I did it again. 7 when two women get married are they both brides or would one prefer to be called the groom? Same for two men are both grooms. 8 how did you find out you were trans if it was because of gender roles and clothing that society has forced on us how would you find that you were trans if it were not like that? Sorry if this offends anyone I am having a hard time understanding. 9 where do you think the line should be drawn in trans women taking part in Women's sports, how can women's sports be inclusive whilst also being fair and safe for everyone taking part? Also, I have never called myself CIS, so why do you feel the need to label me in this way? It's like you will accept the terms that we have made up for you. It's a label being put on without you having agreed to it. I'd like to be called a female, not a CIS female, but apparently that's the new lingo. 10, to trans folks, how does it feel to be complimented when you're the person you want to be? I complimented a trans person and they almost started crying in the bathroom. I thought they looked beautiful and so I gave them a compliment. They came back the next day and gave me coffee and a thank you note. Very sweet. Person 11, why is the drag show subculture of men portraying women in extraordinarily cartoonish and overtly offensive caricaturistic ways performed in schools? I'll go ahead and recognize my question includes some assumed opinions.

My hair looks the exact same as when I came in, only cleaner because it's not meant to cover grays. I told you this, you probably did this on purpose. You know what? Can you just do whatever you have to do to make my hair dark? I don't care at this point. That was the point of this whole trip. I don't want it to be all for not just make me dark. That's fine with me. However, I will be charging You for two all over colors and the additional bowls of product that it requires.

Uh, however, I did see in the notes that you had some concerns about the gray coverage. Well, I want the least amount of damage that I can get and to do so I searched it on TikTok and I found a stylist who did this beautiful color formula using something called Bread Can Shades EQ Gloss in the color 4N and that's what I want. Okay, so just two teeny tiny problems with that one, Redken Shizuku Gloss is just in fact that a gloss it's not going to be able to penetrate your hair and cover the gray. You know, you have to lift and then deposit when doing gray coverage. Um, and secondly 4N is a dark brown. It's not black. So I would be more than happy to do a dark brown on you if that's what you're wanting. Uh, but we would have to use a permanent line you know, we would have to use at least 20 volume. I'm telling you, I saw it with my own two eyes on TikTok. Her hair was extremely dark and it was smooth and it was healthy. Okay, that's totally fine. We can like I said go ahead and do a four end. However, if you are wanting your grays 100% covered, I am telling you now as someone who is licensed in hair And uses shades Hugh gloss on herself. It is not going to cover your gray.

How can I help you? Hi, I know that this is super random and you have no idea who I am, but I was just wondering, do you actually trade services? Yeah, I absolutely trade services. What is it that you do? What are you wanting to trade? This is so exciting. Okay, okay, so I'm a tattoo artist and obviously I know that you have a lot of ink so I was just wondering if you could give me some really cool vivid hair in exchange for a tattoo 1,000% I would love to walk around with an amazing tattoo and I would love for you to walk around with some amazing hair. Uh, you scratch my back I scratch yours but just out of curiosity, do you have an Insta like a portfolio that I can look at and see your work you know, see if it aligns with the kind of work that I get done? I got you. It's blah blah blah blah blah blah. One second I'm looking you up now I'm gonna put you on speaker. Oh, wow, you are very, very talented. Okay, yeah, absolutely. So are you you wanting like all over vivid or you wanting a peekaboo? What do you wanna work out? So I am brunette right now and my hair is long but from roots to ends I want to be rainbow all over like streaks of every single color Of the rainbow, and I want it all rainbow, so you'd have to lighten me all over. And in exchange, I would give you a quarter size flash tattoo, but it is my own personal flash. The amount of work that I would be doing on you does not equate to the size of tattoo that you're offering me.

Um, she needs to be blond, a new mother. Okay. And to bring you to my last question, the most awkward of them. I'm sorry. How young? Well, well, I guess how old do the children have to be for you to apply color on their hair? I believe 10 years old is the youngest that we go. And below that we just do, um, clip in or tape in extensions for the little ones that they can have fun. Well, that's just not true. I've seen so many children do it on those pageant shows. I mean, we typically don't. I guess I could check with management. Can I ask the age real quick before, you know, I go ask? I'm sure that she'll wanna know. So she six. Okay. So you wanna get your six year old some highlights for a pageant? No, she's six months. That's too young for a pageant. Did you just say six months? Okay, so here's the thing. My husband and I are, we are both very blond, very Nordic looking. And she came out brunette and he thinks that I've been cheating. He's ready to divorce me. I don't know. Ma'am, there's no way on God's green earth that you will ever find a salon that will put bleach on a 6 month old's hair. is there a safe brand I can get from Sally's I don't know what to do. Um, I don't know. You could get a DNA test. That's much safer. You, what was your name again? Nope. The last place already threatened me with police.

I totally understand the frustration of not having your hair done and, you know, wanting to look better because it makes you feel better, but unfortunately, that day just isn't doable. I'm just plum out of ideas. I'm gonna need you to tell me what I'm supposed to do on Christmas Day when we're taking photos. I mean, you could try calling any of the salons where you're located. No, young lady, that just doesn't work for me. Where I live now, it's expensive, and I already pay that year round. But since I'm gonna be home for the holidays, I would rather pay the cheap price. And I know y'all are cheap. I looked it up. Okay, then you're gonna have to call another salon in the area, you're just gonna have to get your hair done wherever you're located, because you're not getting your hair done here. Fine, I will. But then I'm just gonna tell you now that you have forced my hand, and all of Yelp is gonna hear about your horrible customer service and the fact that you won't accommodate your clients during the holiday seasons of all times. Okay. We look forward to hearing about your experience with us. Thank you. Happy holidays. Hi, thank you for calling the salon where I work. This is Siri speaking. How can I help you? Yes, hi. Uh, so I called a few days ago, and you told me the only opening that You had was the 23rd, and I was able to get an earlier flight, so I'm just wondering what time that is since I just got into town. Oh, yes, ma'am, I do remember you. So, unfortunately, since you did say that Christmas was the day that you would be here, and the only day that you could do the 23rd appointment did get filled. You've got to be joking. You literally, why didn't you hold the appointment for me? You didn't ask, and you didn't call us to see if it was open.

Our school had this ancient vending machine that was basically a legend for all the wrong reasons. It ate dollars like it was starving, spat out the wrong snacks, or just flat out ignored you. The office kept promising a replacement, but weeks turned into months and nothing changed. So I decided to have a little fun. One morning, I printed a super official looking out of order sign, complete with the school logo, and taped it to the machine. But I didn't stop there. Below the warning, I added, new smart vending machine arriving next week. Voice activated ordering. Just speak clearly to place your request. Then I hit around the corner, phone ready and waited. It didn't take long. A freshman walked up, squinted at the sign, and nervously said, uh, Cheetos. When nothing happened, he tried again, louder. Cheetos, please. By second period, the machine had a full audience. Kids were lining up, having full blown conversations with it. I'd like a Coke Zero. Can I get a Kit Kat? One girl even whispered, water bottle, if that's okay. The best part? Our principal, Miss Carter, strode by during her rounds, paused, and without missing a beat, said, coffee, black. When the machine stayed silent, she leaned in and added, please. By lunch, the entire school was filming reviews of the smart vending machine for TikTok. Even teachers were trying it, half convinced it was some new tech. They Hadn't been briefed. On the next day, I swapped the sign. Voice Recognition calibration complete. Thank you for participating in our beta test. Regular service resumes tomorrow. The school replaced the machine the following week. the new one works perfectly. But sometimes, when no one's watching, you'll still catch someone saying please to it. Just in case.

When my daughter and I moved to a new state, she started having to take the bus to school. Everything was normal. But after a few weeks, she told me an old man started standing and waiting by her bus stop almost every morning. He'd always have candy for them. And this immediately set off red flags in my head. I started walking her there and she was right. He'd and, and watch them before they got on the bus and bring them the strawberry candy I used to eat as a kid. I made sure to check every single one before my daughter ate any and every time. There wasn't anything wrong with it, so I just assumed he was harmless. I told a few other parents about it and they immediately started to seem really creeped out. Eventually, someone ended up calling the police asking them to make him stop. Apparently, they showed up at his house, but he argued that he was just trying to keep them safe. When he stopped showing up in the morning, my daughter started telling me she missed him. I didn't think anything of it until I saw his obituary a year later and my heart broke. His name was Mister Chen and had a daughter who died at a bus stop when she was 9. She had walked out into the road and hit by a distracted driver. Every morning he'd come And hand out his daughter's favorite candy just to keep them away from the road. All he wanted to do was make sure none of us had to go through the same pain he did.

It sounds better than yours. I nodded. Then I quietly returned the 8,000 dollar wedding dress and booked a solo trip. What she found in her closet the next morning left her speechless. We were at the county clerk's office getting our marriage license when Iris dropped the bomb. I'm keeping Richardson, she announced to the confused clerk. But that's your ex husband's name. I said, obviously, Richardson sounds so much better than Kowalski. Polish names are so harsh and ethnic. Richardson opens doors. The casual racism hit like a slap. But then I remembered something that made my blood freeze. She said this exact thing about her first boyfriend's Italian name years ago. This wasn't just about me. This was a pattern. I signed the papers in silence while she chatted about wedding plans, completely oblivious. That night, I made my own plans. But first I called her ex husband, Mateo. Did she keep your name after the divorce for professional reasons, I asked. His bitter laugh told me everything professional reasons, dude. She kept it because she thought it sounded classier than her Maiden name, Stevens. She's been lying to everyone. Stevens. Her real name was Stevens and she was ashamed of that, too. Tuesday morning she left for her spa day. I drove straight to Klein Fields with the receipt. Weddings been called off, I told the manager. 15 minutes later, 8,000. $437 was credited. Back to my card. But here's what she didn't know. I've been the one making all the payments. Because she'd maxed out her credit cards on designer bags she hid from me. I had receipts for everything. Next stop, the venue. I'm canceling everything. I announced the contract was in my name only back $4,500 bridesmaid dresses, photographer, caterer. I systematically canceled everything I paid for. By three PM, I'd recovered nearly $20,000 of my money. Then I made one more call to her maid of honor, Karen. Did you know Iris is embarrassed by ethnic names? What? Her grandmother was Greek papapopopolis before Stevens. The hypocrisy was breathtaking. Been ashamed of her own heritage. But the real bombshell, I checked our joint savings. She'd been secretly transferring money for a surprise honeymoon that was actually a trip to see Mateo in California. Flight confirmations in her email. Then came the final touch. In her closet where her dream dress had hung, I left a note. Since you prefer Richardson to Kowalski, I figured Richardson should pay for your dress. Good luck explaining to Mateo why you were planning to visit him next week, the guy with a harsh name next to it. I hung a Polish flag and printed photos of her flight confirmations. She came home glowing from her spa day. You should see my nails. They're perfect for the wedding. What wedding, I asked support on the coffee table. I canceled everything today. Her face went white. She bolted to the bedroom then came storming back with my note, the flag and the flight confirmations. You went through my email. You went through my savings account. Richardson should buy you a new one. This is psychotic. Over a name, over you planning to cheat with your ex. Next week, she started calling the boutiques. Each conversation ended the same way. Everything was cancelled. Waiting lists were months long. Deposits were gone. Her Instagram influencer dreams crumbled when someone screenshot her old posts about keeping Richardson for professional reasons. The comments were brutal. So you're marrying Richardson again, bro. Dodged a bullet. Her friend group imploded when the group chat leaked, apparently calling Polish names ethnic wasn't her first offensive comment, just the first one that affected someone they knew directly. Her d E. I job launched an investigation after HR saw the screenshots. Hard to promote diversity when you're on record being prejudiced against Polish names. Even her ex husband posted on Facebook. For the record, I've been telling Iris to change her name back since our divorce. It's weird. Also Team Kowalski. Two weeks later, I returned from an incredible solo trip to Japan, found 247 texts, mostly from Iris. Day 7, Mateo heard what happened. He texted me laughing. Her influencer career was dead. Last I heard, she's still single. Still Richardson still living with her parents. The 8,000 dollar dress hangs unworn in her childhood closet. Me. I'm dating someone new. Also Polish thinks Kowalski is a beautiful name. The Polish flag hangs in my living room now, not hidden in a closet. Turns out disrespecting someone's heritage is a great way to end up with no one to marry.

Do all mammals have fur? I told her I was getting a headache and walked home alone. The fair was the breaking point. Four hours there, kids never rode one ride. They got physics lessons instead of the Ferris wheel. See how centrifugal force works, Johnny. Nutrition lessons instead of cotton candy. Sugar affects your brain. Chemistry counting lessons instead of ring toss games. Let's calculate probability. Other families walked past us having actual fun. Kids screaming with joy on rides, faces sticky with cotton candy, clutching stuffed animals. They won. My kids stood there like little professors taking notes. In their heads.

So my boyfriend Cody thinks he's hot shit because he lifts weights and drinks protein shakes all day. We were at target last weekend buying random stuff when this whole thing went down. I'm talking tampons, cereal, the usual boring couple shopping trip. We're in the checkout line and there's this older guy in front of us, maybe 60 something, buying like a cart full of groceries. The cashier is this teenage kid who's clearly new because he's scanning everything super slow and keeps messing up the codes for produce. Cody starts getting all impatient behind me, doing that thing where he sighs really loud and checks his phone every two seconds. The old guy in front of us is just standing there being normal, not saying anything rude to the cashier, who's obviously trying his best. But then Cody decides he's gonna be a tough guy. He taps the old man on the shoulder and goes, hey, buddy, some of us have places to be. Maybe you should use self checkout next time if you're gonna buy half the store. The old guy turns around and he's got this calm look on his face. Doesn't even seem mad. Just looks at Cody for a second and says, you know what? You're absolutely right. I should be more considerate of people who are clearly very important and busy. Cody gets this smug smile like he just won something. But then the Old guy keeps talking. Tell you what, since you're in such a hurry, why don't you help this young man bag my groceries? That way we can all get out of here faster, and you can get back to whatever earth shattering business you have at target on a Saturday afternoon. Trying not to laugh because Cody's face is turning red, he starts stuttering like, I'm not gonna bag your groceries, old man. The guy just shrugs and turns back to the cashier. That's okay, son. Some people are all talk when it comes to actually helping others. I understand. Then he starts chatting with the teenage cashier, asking him how long he's been working there, if he likes the job, just being genuinely nice. Kid brightens up and they're having this normal conversation while Cody is standing behind us steaming. When the old guy finishes paying, he turns to Cody one more time. You know, I was your age once. Thought I knew everything. Thought everyone else was just in my way. Then I spent 30 years as a high school teacher and Learned that patience and kindness get you a lot further than attitude. He looks right at me and says, you seem like a sweet girl. I hope you find someone who treats service workers with the same I'm respect they'd want for themselves. Then he just walks away. I'm standing there completely stunned because this random stranger just basically told me my boyfriend is trash without Even raising his voice. And the worst part is, he was totally right. Cody tries to play it off like, what a weird old guy, right? But I can see he

So my daughter Emma is 15 and I've been remarried to my wife, Jessica, for about three years now. Jessica has two daughters from her previous marriage, Katie, who's 17, and Megan, who's sixteen. We were planning this family vacation to Orlando for spring break and I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity for all the girls. The hotel had these family suites with two bedrooms and a pull out couch in the living area. I figured the three girls could share one room with two beds and Jessica and I would take the other. Simple enough, right? Wrong. The first night I'm getting ready for bed around 10:30 when I hear this commotion from the girls room. I walk over and knock on the door asking if everything's okay. Katie opens it just a crack and says they're fine, just figuring out sleeping arrangements. I could see Emma in the background sitting on the floor next to her suitcase looking miserable. I asked what was going on and Katie starts explaining how she and Megan both have back problems and need the beds. She says Emma's young and flexible so the floor would be fine for her. I look past Katie and see Emma has already made herself a little nest with the spare comforter on the hard carpet between the beds. I told Katie that wasn't happening. And that they needed to figure out a fair way to share. She gets this attitude and says Emma's not even her real sister, so why should she give up her comfort? Megan chimes in from behind her saying Emma's dad can deal with it if he doesn't like their arrangement. Jessica comes over at this point asking what's wrong? When I explain the situation, she just kind of shrugs and says the girls worked it out themselves. She suggests maybe Emma could sleep on the pull out couch in the living room if the floor is too uncomfortable. I'm standing there thinking this is insane. My daughter is being treated like some kind of unwanted guest in what's supposed to be a family vacation. Emma's just sitting there quietly, not wanting to cause drama, which honestly made me even angrier. I told everyone to hold on and went back to my room to grab my phone. I pulled up the hotel booking app and reserved Emma her own room right there on the spot. Cost me an extra $250 for the three nights, but I didn't care. When I came back and announced Emma was getting her own room, you should have seen the looks on Katie and Megan's faces. They suddenly started backtracking, saying they could make space, that they were just joking around. Jessica looked annoyed and said I was being dramatic.

But what happened next is leaving people outraged. The driver pleaded guilty to assault and hit and run and was sentenced to only 5 to 7 months at a juvenile detention camp. That to me seems almost like a light sentence. You try to kill two people and, and you get five months in a juvenile camp.

He pulled out several hundred dollar bills and handed them to the cashier and he actually used the counterfeit pens on them, which worked. Um, once he did that, it appeared that another male that was with them, possibly a lookout, um, he signaled to another girl that was with them to, you know, hey, come up here and do your transaction. That woman and used another several hundred dollar bills to buy a visa gift card. A counterfeit pen also showed that the bills were real. All three walked out of the store and nobody realized anything was wrong. And later on when they were counting the cash in there using a actual cash counter, those bills were all flagged, um, as counterfeit. Detective Nate Lean with the Danville Police Department said the trio scam the store out of 800 dollar Teen Kroger stores in Indiana, mostly in the Indianapolis area, and has cost the supermarket chain nearly $12,000. In all 14 cases, $100, uh, counterfeit bills were used. Um, they're using them to buy the green dot cards, the visa gift cards and what not. And as long as they can get them to pass, that money now turns into legitimate money because it's now on a gift card.

When I discovered why she kept calling, I made one decision that burned his life to the ground. I didn't notice it at first. You think a woman would immediately recognize when her boyfriend of two years is lying about his psycho stalker ex. But Hayden was smart about it. He'd show me threatening texts from his crazy ex, delete her number in front of me, then restore everything when I left for work. It wasn't until she contacted my work email directly that I saw the first crack in his story. This woman is insane, Hayden said, reading her message over my shoulder. How did she even find where you work? The message didn't sound crazy. Please, just five minutes. He's lying to you. I have proof. Delete it, he said, not meeting my eyes. Has she been stalking you this whole time? I asked. Since we broke up two years ago, Sylvia. He pulled me close. I sat there stunned. We've been together for two years. Why is she still contacting you? Some people can't handle rejection, he said dismissively. I've tried everything. Police won't help without physical threats. I just protect you from most of it. I believed him until I met his ex. Three weeks later, I was at my usual coffee shop when a woman approached my table. Professional blazer, designer bag, and visibly pregnant. You're Sylvia, she said quietly. I studied her Face, pretty, put together. Nothing like the unstable person Hayden described. You're the ex. I'm not his ex. She placed her hand on her belly. I'm his girlfriend of four years. And this is his baby. The coffee shop seemed to tilt and stayed at my place five nights a week. We had dinner with my parents every Sunday. We were planning a vacation to Spain. What did she mean, girlfriend of four years? She pulled out her phone, hand steady, this is shocking. She showed me recent photos from last week. Hayden kissing her belly, their shared apartment lease from three months ago, an ultrasound dated two weeks prior with Hayden signature on the sign in sheet. Text messages where Hayden called me. This crazy girl from work who keeps hitting on me, and the stalker who won't leave me alone. Your work trips? I managed to ask. Those are his nights home with me. She scrolled through her calendar. He tells me he's at sales conferences. I took photos of every piece of evidence. We sat there for 90 minutes, comparing schedules, matching lies. Her name was Raya. They've been together since college. The pregnancy was planned. They were house shopping. She hadn't even known about me until recently. That night, when Hayden arrived at my apartment, I played my role perfectly. I kissed him hello, made dinner, asked about his day. He sprawled on my couch discussing our weekend plans while simultaneously texting that he Was stuck at a client dinner that was running late for three days. I investigated everything. Found his parents on Facebook, devoted Catholics who posted daily Bible verses. Discovered they paid his rent believing he was in graduate school for his NBA. Found out his father had gotten him the job at their friends investment firm. Learned they had no idea about Raya, the pregnancy, or me. Raya and I were now allies, sharing information.

Okay, so I'm a 31 year old single mom to my daughter Emma, who's 8. Last month, I found out about this summer program at her school where kids can go before the year starts to do fun activities and get used to their new classroom. Emma was super excited about it, so we went shopping for all the required supplies. Now, here's the thing. At Emma's old school, kids would steal her stuff constantly. Her cute erasers would disappear, her good coloured pencils would vanish, and she'd come home upset, asking why everyone took her things. So this time, I wasn't taking any chances. I went full mom mode on those supplies. I used permanent marker to write E M M A. In big letters on every single crayon, marker, glue stick, and even the individual pieces of paper in her notebook. I glued her name onto her clear backpack with industrial adhesive so nobody could peel it off. I wrote her initials on every single page of her sketchbook. I even carved her name into her pencil case with a knife. Emma thought it was fun watching me label everything. We made it into a game where she'd hand me each item and I'd find a new spot to put her name. By the end, you couldn't look at any of her supplies without seeing E M M A. Written somewhere. First day of the program arrives, And Emma's bouncing off the walls, excited. I packed her labeled backpack, gave her a kiss, and sent her off. When I picked her up that afternoon, she looked confused and kind of sad. Turns out the teacher had made an announcement that all the supplies were going into a big communal pile to be shared equally among all the kids. Teacher said some families couldn't afford to buy supplies, so they were redistributing everything to make it fair. But here's where it gets crazy. When the teacher started sorting through the supplies and saw E M M A. Written on literally everything, she got annoyed. She apparently held up Emma's crayon box in front of the whole class and said, this is what happens when parents don't read the instructions properly and made Emma feel embarrassed. The teacher called me that evening. She explained that they pull all supplies together because not every family can afford the full list. Some kids show up with nothing, and they don't want anyone to feel left out. I told her I understood the concept, but asked why Emma had to be humiliated in front of everyone. The teacher said Emma would need to bring unmarked supplies if she wanted to continue the program. So I had a choice. Buy all new supplies and waste the money I'd already spent, or pull Emma out of something she was excited about. I decided to get creative instead. The next morning, I showed up at School with a bottle of nail polish remover and spent two hours in the parking lot scrubbing Emma's name off every single item. Other parents walking by kept staring at me like I was insane. Sitting there with a pile of school supplies trying to erase permanent marker. Some items were easy to fix, but others were ruined.

The life changing tragedy had its origins during a vacation in the Caribbean with her husband. Marie says she was using her key card to access her hotel when she accidentally nicked herself on her wrist. It was a tiny little scratch, a silly accident. It hardly hurt. When Marie came home, her dog Taylor greeted her with lots of kisses. But the dog also licked Marie's scratch. Four days later, Marie got very sick and was rushed to the hospital with a severe infection and septic shock. Her arms were turning black all the way up just below her shoulders. It turns out that her dog's saliva carried a bacteria called capnocytophaga. It's quite common in dogs, but what happened to Marie is a very rare occurrence. Her husband Matthew is doing his best to lift her spirits. I love her to death. She's everything to me.

Wait. The child's mother recorded this video. Why didn't she stop the beating? Mom told deputies the school called Tuesday, April 13th, saying her daughter damaged the computer. The fee, $50. In the report, mom says the school also mentioned paddling with her and a deputy present. In the report, the mother says she didn't understand the process correctly. Later that day, she went to the school to pay the fee and they took her into the principal's office. We know the name of the woman with the paddle through a report from the Henry County Sheriff's Office. It says the principal of Central Elementary, Melissa Carter, and Cecilia Self, a clerk, are the two women in the video. We tried to reach them through the school district, but we're unsuccessful. Henry County School District's policy does not allow corporal punishment. It says, quote, the superintendent shall designate sanctions for the infractions of rules excluding corporal punishment. It's now up to the state attorney to decide whether to pursue charges against the principal and the clerk in the video.

It started three months ago with a bottle of wine. Not cheap stuff either. Like a hundred dollar bottle sitting next to my door. When I got home from work, there was this little yellow sticky note that just said I'm sorry in neat handwriting. I figured someone made a delivery mistake, so I just brought it inside and forgot about it. Then it was a gift card to that fancy steakhouse downtown. Fifty bucks. Same yellow note, same handwriting. My neighbour Caleb lives right next door with his girlfriend Amy, and they seem normal enough. We'd wave in the mornings when I was leaving for work and he was getting his newspaper. Never really talked much beyond nice weather type stuff. But the gifts kept coming. Apple AirPods still in the box. A leather jacket that actually fit me perfectly. Which was weird because how would anyone know my size? Each time, that same yellow note. I'm sorry. No explanation, no signature, nothing else. I finally decided to ask Caleb about it. Maybe he'd seen someone dropping stuff off. So I knocked on his door around dinner time and Amy answered. She looked nervous. Like really nervous. Her hands were shaking a little when she held the door. Oh, hey, she said, not making eye contact. Caleb's not here right now. I could literally hear the TV in the background and someone walking Around. Are you sure? I just wanted to ask about some packages that might have been delivered to the wrong address. Face went completely white. What packages? That's when Caleb appeared behind her, and the look on his face was pure panic, like I'd caught him doing something terrible. Hey there. What's up? He said, but his voice was all shaky. I described the gifts, and Amy actually stepped backwards into their house. Caleb ran his hand through his hair about five times while I was talking. Haven't seen anything like that. Sorry, he said. Then he literally closed the door in my face. That night, I heard them arguing through the thin walls. Couldn't make out words, but Amy was crying, and Caleb kept saying something that sounded like it was an accident over and over. The next morning, there was a brand new coffee maker on my doorstep. Had to be worth at least $200. Same note, but this time the handwriting looked rushed, like someone wrote it really fast. I decided to stay home from work the next day and hide behind my living room curtains to see who was leaving this stuff. Around noon, Caleb came outside. He looked around nervously, then placed a small wrapped box by my door. But here's the weird part. He was crying. Actually crying while he put the gift down. I waited until he went back inside, then grabbed the box. It was a really expensive watch. Probably worth more Than I make in a week. But this time the note was different. Said I'm so sorry about Murphy in that same handwriting. Murphy? I didn't know any Murphy, but something about the name made my stomach drop. I marched over to Caleb's door and banged on it until he answered. Who's Murphy? I demanded. Caleb

What's the wildest thing you've discovered while at work? I got hired to upgrade a fancy law firm security system. The senior partner, Marcus, walked me around on my first day, pointing to cameras in every corner. After our break in scare last year, we spared no expense. He bragged 24 premium surveillance units. He handed me a key card. The server room is in the basement. That's where the magic happens. I went downstairs expecting a wall of monitors and blinking lights. Instead, I found a storage closet. It was a folding table, a dusty, unplugged computer monitor, and a handwritten sticky note that said, thanks for the laughs, suckers. Your former IT guy. Every single camera in the building was a $12 fake from Amazon with a blinking red light. I called Marcus down and showed him. His face went white as I explained his entire state of the art system wasn't connected to anything, but we haven't had a single problem since they were installed. He stammered. His reaction felt off. A little too dramatic, a little too rehearsed. He agreed instantly to my idea, installing one single real high definition camera hidden inside the biggest fake one in the main lobby. He was almost too eager. Dot. That night, I installed the camera in the lobby like we agreed, but my gut felt weird about his reaction, so I installed a second one. A tiny camera disguised as a USB phone. Charger that I plugged in behind his desk in his office. Dot. Three months later, my phone rings at 6:00am. It's Marcus, sounding panicked. The lobby camera caught her. You have to get here right now. I rushed to the firm. He had the footage already pulled up. It was their head paralegal Sarah, clearly photographing confidential client files with her phone. The part partners were gathered, ready to call the police. Marcus stood there, looking grim, but also smug. I'll archive the footage for you, I said, and then added, but first I need to download the files from the other camera to make sure the timeline is complete. Marcus froze. What other camera? I turned my laptop around and played the footage from the charger in his office. It was from the day before. It showed Marcus handing Sarah a thick envelope of cash. He was telling her to go to the lobby after hours, pretend to steal documents. In return, he'd give her a massive Severance package. The original break in a year ago was him. He'd been selling client data all along and installed the fake cameras himself to make sure there was never any proof. He was trying to frame Sarah to close his own loose ends. Dot! The other partners just stared, completely silent, as security walked a speechless Marcus out of the office. The firm's biggest security threat wasn't a burglar. It was the man who hired me.

In the video, my husband and my son were with her, and my son was hugging her, saying he wished she could be his mother. I stared at my phone in complete shock, watching my eight year old tell another woman he wanted her as his mom. My birthday cake sat untouched on the kitchen counter. Two candles melted into colorful puddles of wax. The balloons I'd hung that morning mocked me from the ceiling. Instead of crying like the old me would have done, I did something that would change everything forever. I called my lawyer first. Jennifer, it's Paisley.

Then I saw the group photo. All of them, on a private beach in Maui. I stared at my phone in disbelief. My entire family had ditched my wedding for a vacation. The caption read, finally together. Like I didn't exist. But here's what they didn't know. For years, I've been quietly bankrolling their lifestyle. The family business cards all linked to my accounts. Their mortgage co signs my credit. The lake house utilities, auto pay from my bank. I've been the invisible ATM, funding their perfect lives while they whispered that my wife wasn't their kind of people. So I sent one text back. Perfect timing. Then I called my attorney. Within an hour, I'd cut off every shared account, cancelled every auto payment, and revoked access to everything. The secondary property my sister lived in. She was using my credit for the rate. Not anymore. It started small. Day 3, the dealership called about a bounced car lease. Day 5, the office building sent late rent warnings. By week two, the group chat was pure chaos. Can someone cover the lakehouse utilities? My card got declined for Scottsdale. Does the company still cover insurance? They were scrambling, but still no apology. Confusion about why their money fountain suddenly dried up. Then my sister called. First time since the wedding. Not congratulations or sorry we missed it. Just, you can't do this to us. I didn't even Answer just blocked the number. But the real fun was just beginning. See, I'd forgotten about one little detail. My dad's precious boat. The 40 foot yacht he loved showing off at the Marina every weekend. Guess whose name was on the insurance policy week

Who's the most memorable patient you've ever worked with? His name was Gregory, and he only spoke once a day. Right after breakfast, he'd sit in the rec room, sip his orange juice and say one sentence that made everyone's skin crawl, someone's going to die today. At first, all of us ignored him. Gregory had been in and out of mental hospitals his whole adult life. Schizophrenia, they said, delusions, nothing new for us workers. But then nurse Janet collapsed in the parking lot that same afternoon, massive heart attack, dead before the ambulance arrived. We figured it was just a coincidence. People die all the time, right? But the next week, Gregory did it again. Same routine, orange juice, same chair, same creepy voice. Someone's going to die today. That night, our night cook, Eddie, never made it home. His car wrapped around a tree on Highway 9. Police said he fell asleep at the wheel. That's when we started paying attention. I mean, really paying attention. We began writing down everything Gregory said and checking obituaries, hospital records, anything we could find. Six straight months, Gregory was right every single time. Sometimes it was a patient who had a stroke in their sleep. Sometimes it was a staff member's spouse whose cancer suddenly got worse. Sometimes it was random people we'd never heard of, but their names would show up in the paper the next day. We called in specialists from the university, psychiatrists Neurologists, even some professor who studied paranormal psychology, nobody could explain it. Gregory couldn't explain it either. When doctors asked him how he knew, he just shrug and say he didn't want to know. He just did. The whole staff was on edge. Every morning after breakfast, we'd all gather around and wait for Gregory's daily prediction like it was the weather report from hell. Some nurses started calling in sick just to avoid hearing it. But then one Tuesday morning, Gregory said something different. Something that made my blood freeze. This place will burn. Holy shit. We took that seriously. Fire drills every day. The maintenance team checked every single outlet, every space heater, every piece of kitchen equipment. Twice the fire department came through and gave us a clean inspection. Nothing was wrong. Everything looked perfect. Two weeks later, we had a new patient. Seventeen year old Caleb who tried to burn down his family's garage. During intake. Security missed the tiny lighter he'd hidden under his tongue. Rookie mistake. It was 3 a. M. When the smoke started. Caleb had lit a mop in the supply closet and the whole thing went up fast.

That's a New York number. I didn't know who it was. I picked it up anyway. I hit talk. I said, hello. Guy in the line goes, hey, Bruce, what's going on? My name is Jay, not Bruce. So I said, nothing much, man. What's going on with you? And he said, I'll tell you what's going on. I just got an email about the budget. It's supposed to be 15,000, now it's 10,000, and I'd like to know what's up. I got excited in my chest. I grabbed the steering wheel. I was like, okay, focus. Your name is Bruce. There's a budget. It was 15,000, now it's 10,000. No one's happy about it. That's all we know. That's all we know. So I just repeated back to him what he said to me, and I go, 10,000 is supposed to be 15,000. He goes, yeah, I know. Well, I just got an email, and now it's ten. I go, listen, man, I don't know what to tell you. I've been on the road all day, you know, I haven't even seen it. And he goes, did you send this out? I'm giving some attitude to Bruce. I didn't like it. I said, listen, man, the budget was 15,000. We had a couple Extra expenditures. It went up to 16 2. I reworked it, got it down to 14 7. I had 300 to play with, so I called it 15, and I sent it out. And he goes, yeah, well, now it's 10, man. And I was like, oh, my god. That worked. That worked. Phase one complete. Phase one complete. Like, now I'm in the door, I have a 4:01 K. I was at the Christmas party, okay? So he goes, did Larry okay this? I go, listen, man, I took the budget to Larry. Larry said it looked fine, but I knew it was my ass on the line, so I ran it by Jennifer just in case, just to double check. Jennifer said it looked good. I sent it out. He goes, yeah, well, now it's 10, man. And I realized this guy has no idea what's going on over there. He hasn't talked to Larry. I know he hasn't talked to Bruce. He doesn't even recognize my voice. I know he didn't talk to Jennifer. I just made her up. So he goes, listen, man, what are we gonna do about this? And I go, listen, I'm on the road right now. I haven't even seen the email. Why don't you give Larry a call, check in with him, see what he says, call me back. Just praying he will, because that return phone call was going to be amazing. And he goes, you know what? Why don't Wait till you get home. You check the email, you call Larry, you call me back. And I go, nah, nah, bro. Larry knows way more about this than I do. Give him a call, call me back. He goes, okay, hangs up the phone. To which I explode with euphoria because there's a small business in New York that is crumbling to the ground over five grand, and nobody can find Jennifer. They're looking. They're looking. I get home, I'm so excited. I take out my cell phone. I'm like, you know what?

That's what he is. He's a random guy. Four or five days pass. I forget about it. Laying on my couch watching the ball game. Phone rings in the dining room table. I get up. Watching the game. Grab the phone, watching the game, look down, random guy.

My Uncle Rusty was always the fun uncle who'd entertain all the kids. He was this larger than life guy who could do magic tricks and always had candy in his pockets. All the neighborhood kids loved him. He wasn't married and didn't have kids of his own, so he'd basically adopt all of us for the day. One particular barbecue stands out because of what happened with my little cousin Aria. She was maybe four at the time and super shy around everyone except me. She followed me everywhere that day, which was kind of annoying because I was trying to hang out with the older kids. So Uncle Rusty announces he's gonna do this new magic trick and all the kids gather around. I remember being super excited because his tricks were always amazing. He asks for a volunteer and picks Arya. Surprised me because she was so shy, but she went up all excited. The trick was supposed to be him making a quarter disappear and then pulling it out of her ear. Pretty standard stuff. But what happened next is the funny story my family cannot stop telling. When Uncle Rusty reached toward Aria's ear, she freaked out, like, full on screaming, crying, trying to run away. My aunt had to come grab her while everyone was laughing because they thought she was just being dramatic. Uncle Rusty played it up, acting All offended, which made all the adults laugh even harder. The next part is what my family thinks is hilarious. Uncle Rusty decided to get revenge on Arya for ruining his trick. Every time she'd calm down, he'd slowly approach her with a quarter, and she'd start screaming again. This went on all day. By the end of the barbecue, he just had to pull a quarter from his pocket and hold it up, and she burst into tears. My parents, aunts, uncles, they were literally crying from laughing so hard. They kept saying how funny it was that she was so scared of something so harmless. This became Uncle Rusty's bit with Aria. At every family gathering after that, he'd pull out a quarter and wave it at her, and everyone would crack up when she'd get upset. I remember one Thanksgiving when I was about 12, Aria was hiding under the dining room table before dinner. I crawled under there to see what was up, and she whispered that she was hiding from Uncle Rusty because she knew he'd do the quarter thing again. She was literally shaking, and I remember thinking it was kind of weird how scared she still was. I told her she was being a baby, which makes me feel terrible now. At Christmas that same year, Uncle Rusty took it to another level. He wrapped a small box for Aria, and when she opened it, there were, like, 50 quarters inside. She dropped The box! And ran crying from the room while all the adults howled with laughter. My mom still brings this up as the funniest Christmas moment ever. When Arya turned 10, her parents threw her this big birthday party with a magician. As soon as the magician started pulling coins out for tricks, Aria had a complete meltdown. Everyone thought it was so funny that she was still doing this bit. The magician was confused, but Uncle Rusty filled him in, and even he started incorporating quarters into all his tricks specifically to scare Aria. A grown adult professional deliberately terrifying a child on her birthday. And everyone thought it was comedy gold. I was too young to really process it then, but looking back now, I'm like, we were literally traumatizing this little girl for years and treating it like a hilarious joke, and the adults were encouraging it. The story got darker when I was home last month helping my mom clean out some old photo albums. We found pictures from those barbecues, and there was one of Aria crying while Uncle Rusty held a quarter near her. My mom was like, Omg, remember how funny that was? And I just couldn't laugh. I asked mom if she ever wondered why Aria was so terrified that first time, and mom just shrugged and said, kids are weird. But I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I called Aria. We're not super close, but we follow each other on Social media. I asked her if she remembered the quarter trick and if she knew why she was so scared. There was this long pause on the phone. Then she told me something that made my stomach

Yesterday, my phone rang at 2:00am. It was the police. Ma'am, we have your six year old son, Tommy at the station. He walked here by himself, saying his mommy heard his baby sister. I shot out of bed. What? Tommy's in his room sleeping. And I don't have a baby sister. Ma'am, please come down to the station immediately. I ran to Tommy's room. Empty bed, front door wide open. At the police station, Tommy was wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The moment he saw me, he screamed, don't let her take me. She killed my sister. My heart stopped. The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away, too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room while Tommy sobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My Stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. I spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. His little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. The psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy's story never changed. Hours passed. The detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Ex explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She showed me the room. She made All pink and pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us?

I was 12 when a man in a blue pickup truck pulled up next to me while I was walking home from school. He asked if I wanted to earn $20 helping him move boxes. My parents had always warned me about strangers, but $20 seems like a fortune to a kid who got $5 allowance. The moment I got in his truck, I knew I'd made a terrible mistake. He immediately locked the doors and started driving in the opposite direction of where he said we were going. When I asked where we were headed, he told me to shut up and sit still. He drove for what felt like hours to a small cabin in the woods. No neighbors, no cell towers, nothing but trees. He dragged me inside and tied me to a chair in what looked like a basement. The smell was awful, like something had died down there. For the first two days, he barely spoke to me except to bring stale bread and warm water. I cried constantly, begging him to let me go home. He just stared at me with these cold, empty eyes and said my parents probably hadn't even noticed I was gone yet. On the third day, he made a mistake. He left his phone on the table while he went upstairs to make himself lunch. I could hear him moving around in the kitchen above me. The rope around my wrists, Had loosened slightly from struggling, and I managed to work one hand free. I grabbed his phone and called the first number I could think of, my mom's work number that she'd made me memorize for emergencies. When she answered, I whispered as quietly as I could, mom, I've been kidnapped. I'm in a cabin somewhere. There are tall pine trees everywhere, and I can hear a train in the distance. Before I could say more, I heard his footsteps coming down the stairs. I quickly put the phone back and got my hand back in the rope just as he appeared. He looked at me suspiciously, but didn't seem to notice anything different. What I didn't know was that my mom had immediately called the police while staying on the line. They traced the call and started searching for cabins near train tracks in our area. Meanwhile, she kept calling his phone every few minutes, hoping I'd answer the next morning. He seemed agitated, kept looking out the windows and pacing around the cabin. I realised later that police helicopters had been circling the area, getting closer to finding us. He started talking about moving me somewhere else, which terrified me. That afternoon, he went outside to load something into his truck. I heard him talking to someone on the phone, getting angry. While he was distracted, I noticed he'd left the basement door unlocked. This was my chance. I quietly climbed the stairs and saw him through the Window, still arguing on the phone by his truck. The front door was about 15 feet away. I knew I had to be smart about this. If I ran straight out, he'd see me immediately. Instead, I crawled on my hands and knees toward the back of the cabin. There was a small window near the floor that looks like it might be big enough for me to squeeze through. I managed to push it open and wiggle through, scraping my arms and legs on the frame. Once outside, I ran as fast as I could toward the sound of the train tracks. I figured if I could reach them, I might find help, or at least know which direction LED back to civilization. My legs felt like jelly from being tied up for days, but pure adrenaline kept me moving. After running for about 10 minutes, I heard dogs barking in the distance. Then I heard voices calling my name. It was the search and rescue team my mom had called in. I screamed as loud as I could and kept running toward the voices. A police officer

So my sister Emma has always been the golden child. Like, seriously, my parents would literally ignore me bleeding on the floor if Emma needed help opening a pickle jar. She's three years older than me and has spent our entire lives making sure I knew I was second place. The wedding was supposed to be this huge deal. Emma was marrying this guy Jake, who seemed decent enough, but I always got weird vibes from how she talked about other people when he wasn't around. Like, she'd be all sweet to his mom's face, then immediately trash talk her the second she left the room. Two weeks before the wedding, I'm at Emma's apartment helping her address invitations because apparently I'm the only one with decent handwriting. Goes to the bathroom and leaves her phone on the table. It starts buzzing with text, and I see Jake's name pop up. The preview shows him asking about some girl named Ashley. I know I shouldn't have, but something felt off. I opened the messages and started scrolling up. What I found made my stomach drop. Emma had been cheating on Jake for, like, eight months with this coworker named Ryan. Messages were disgusting. Not just the sexual stuff, but Emma was literally laughing about how stupid Jake was and how easy it was to fool him. There were messages about how she was only marrying Jake because he made good money and her parents loved Him. She called him boring and said she'd probably divorce him in a few years after she got what she wanted. The worst part was her making fun of his mom, who had been nothing but sweet to our whole family. Emma called her a pathetic old cow and joked about putting her in a nursing home as soon as possible. I screenshot everything. My hands were literally shaking. When Emma came back, I acted normal, but inside I was freaking out. This wasn't just cheating. This was her about to destroy this guy's entire life. Jake had been talking about wanting kids soon, buying a house together, the whole thing. He was completely in love with her. I spent the next two weeks going insane. Kept thinking about telling Jake, but Emma's always been scary when she's mad. And my parents would definitely take her side. They'd probably kick me out or something. I was 18 and still living at home while going to community college. The wedding day comes. It's at this fancy hotel, like 200 people, the works. I'm the maid of honour because family obligation or whatever. The whole morning, Emma's being extra awful, screaming at the hair lady, making our cousin cry because her dress looked better than Emma wanted. During the reception, Emma gets up to give the speech about how grateful she is for everyone being there and how much she loves Jake. He's going on about how honest and trustworthy their relationship. Is how they never keep secrets from each other. People are crying. Jake's mom is beaming, and Jake looks like he's about to cry happy tears. That's when something inside me just snapped. I stood up and asked if I could add something to the speech. Emma looked in.

I used to fake sick at least once a month. Nothing dramatic, just your classic ugh, my stomach hurts routine. I'd shuffle into the kitchen, wrap myself in a blanket, throw in a little cough and wait for my mom to sigh and say, fine, but no video games. She always fell for it or maybe she just didn't care enough to argue. This time felt no different. It was a Thursday. I had a math test I wasn't ready for and zero energy to sit through Mr Danner's 45 minute rant about fractions. So I pulled out the old stomachache move. My mom was already halfway out the door for work, so she just nodded and left. I grabbed a bowl of cereal, hopped onto the couch and turned on some cartoons, already feeling like I'd won. Dad works nights, so he usually sleeps through most of the day and the house stays quiet. But around 10:00, I heard his door open. I muted the TV and listened. He walked past the living room without noticing me, phone in hand, and stepped out into the garage. Didn't think much of it at first. Figured maybe he was calling in sick or trying to get a refund for something. But then I heard his voice through the wall and it wasn't his normal voice. Quiet, tired, flat. I can't do this anymore, he said. I paused. I tried. I really Tried, but I feel like I don't even know my family anymore. I come home and everything's just cold. I tiptoed down the hall, heart suddenly racing. The garage door was cracked open, just like always, and I crouched beside it. I know this isn't what we wanted, but it's where we are now, he said. Every day I feel like I'm just pretending, pretending to be fine, pretending to be a good husband, a good dad. My stomach twisted. This time for real. I mean, look at him, he said. He doesn't even like me. He doesn't talk to me unless he wants something. And when he does, it's just one word answers. I don't even know who he is anymore. My throat went dry. I look at him and all I can think is, what happened? What did I do wrong? When did he start looking at me like I was a stranger? There was silence then. I know it's awful, but sometimes I wonder if I'd be happier alone, just starting over, somewhere quiet, somewhere nobody knows me. My chest felt like it caved in. I haven't said anything to her yet, he continued. I don't even know if I will, but I can't keep going like this. Exhausted, I backed away from the door before I could hear more. I stumbled into the bathroom and locked the door behind me, sat on the edge of the tub and stared at the floor. He didn't know I. Was home. He didn't know I was listening and he definitely didn't know I had just realized something I could never unhear. My dad didn't just feel lost, he felt lost because of me. I stayed in the bathroom for over an hour just trying to breathe. When I finally came out, he was back in his room. I crept into mine, got under the covers and didn't move for the rest of the day. Later that night, he knocked on my door. How's your stomach, he asked. Fine, I mumbled. Need anything? No. He stood there for a second longer, then said, okay, let me know. I said nothing.

First off, stop saying my husband. He is your dad. Second off, stop lying. Mom, this weirdo is not my dad. He is your boyfriend. My dad is gone. And second, you always ignore it when I tell you what he does. Because you're lying, Helen. So you're just gonna act like you didn't see him sniff the chair? The perfume you were wearing smelled amazing, so I don't blame him. Or when he wouldn't stop complimenting me when I was wearing my new dress. He was just admiring your beauty, that's all. Mom, you can't be serious. I literally have a bruise on my arm. Here you go making up lies again, you. I slipped down the stairs. Helen, you're only doing this because you're mad I divorced your dad. So now you're trying to make my new husband look like a villain? Stop lying! I asked my favourite astrology app, Astra app, for advice, and it said my mom is a Gemini, and Geminis don't take serious. So I should show her proof so it's in her face. Mom, you know what? Since you think I'm such a liar, how about you come home so I can show you proof? You know what? Yeah. As soon as I come home, I'm telling Derek to come to the dinner table so we can talk about this. I'll be waiting. Well, after talking with you two, I do believe Derek did it. But It seems like you deserved it. Deserved it? Mom, are you crazy? This man is not my father, so he has no right to do anything to me. You were talking out of line. So you were disciplined? I told you to respect your elders. Mom, I am a whole 18 years old. This man has no right over me whatsoever. I can't believe you defend this. Are you that delulu? Watch your mouth when speaking to the woman who carried you for nine months. I had a long day at work, so I will be sleeping now. Goodbye. Mom, you can't be serious. Mom, mom, you'd never believe this. What? You're getting ready to lie on my husband again? Mom, I found a camp in my bathroom. Wait, what? How did you even find that? I unscrewed the head of the shower and I seen it looking right back at me. Your husband has been watching? Helen, I'm tired of you always putting the blame on him. He didn't do that, mom. What? This is literally his house we just moved into. Who else could have put it there? I don't know, but it wasn't him. So shut up and stop trying to separate me from my man! Mom, you can't be serious. Shut up, mom! Ever since you found this man, it's like you've completely changed as a person. You don't care about me at all or what's happening. You treat his kids way better than you treat Me? They get all the love and attention, and I get nothing but being told to sit in my room alone. You're letting this man tear us apart. He's clearly a weirdo. Helen, that's enough out of you. If you keep lying, you will be grounded for a year. I can't believe you. Mom! Mom, he's giving me that creepy look again. I'm so scared. It's just us right now. Helen, I don't have time for you right now. I am at work. Please stop overreacting. Mom, no, I'm so serious. He's being extremely weird right now. I don't care. Here. Mom, he just tried me, so I ran into my room and locked the door. Mom, please come home. I need you to come see the type of man you marry. Helen. What? What? Maybe if you stopped being so difficult, there wouldn't be a problem. Difficult? Mom, you can't be serious. Mom, he's about to break this door open! Honestly, Helen, I don't care. This is your fault for being such a headache. Maybe if you acted better, things like this wouldn't happen. Who do you think you are? Not responding to your mom, huh? Helen? Helen! Just got home. Where did you and my husband run off to? The door is broken and your room is a mess. What did you do to him, you little rascal? You can now check part 2 by pressing share. Then more.

Womp, womp. What do you mean, womp, womp? You don't even care. She was your girlfriend for two years, Justin. She loved you for two years. Listen, Tammy, this is not my problem. She overreacted and did something irrational. That's on her, not me. Justin, you literally broke her heart. How could you after the two years of her being there for you? When big sis Jessica passed away, that hurt us bad. And she was there for you, making sure you were okay. When you couldn't take me to school because you were too sad to get out of the bed, Emma came to take me. She would always take care of me, like how our big sister would before she passed. She would always buy me food, pack my lunch, and would even come over to watch me and take care of me when nobody was home. She would stay home with me just to play Barbies with me, to make sure I wasn't scared being alone. She was the best girlfriend you ever had. She was the sister I needed after big sis passed away.

You lost the best thing you had. Stop talking to me, mom. I still can't believe she's gone. I couldn't stop Crying after seeing her in the casket. I know, baby. It broke all of our hearts. We lost a beautiful soul that day. She was the perfect daughter I never asked for. Always taking care of us like she was a part of this family. We will miss her forever. Everyone will miss her. Except Justin. Justin is so evil. How could he do that to her? I talked to your brother, Tammy, and what he did was absolutely terrible and unforgivable. He should be grounded forever. Sadly, I can't do anything since he's a 20 year old man. Mommy, I really think this is my fault. If I would have just shut my mouth, Emma would still be here. But I decided to be a loud mouth. This is all because of me. Baby. No, you did the right thing. Don't ever feel bad about doing the right thing. Yeah. Mommy, could you at least take me to see Emma again? I miss her so much. I want to play Barbies with her. I wish I could, Tammy, but I'm so tired and I have work tomorrow. Auntie, can you send me a rizz app line so mommy can take me? This will for sure make mommy smile. Say this. My love for you will give you all the energy you need. My love for you will give you all the energy you need. Oh, that's so sweet. You're right. I do have enough energy for one more trip. Meet me at the car. Yay! I'm bringing my Barbies! I'm bringing my new Barbies to come play with you. Emma, I miss you so much. You were the best thing I had in my life. I will never forget you. And I'll keep that promise that we made at your grave. That I will come play Barbies with you every single day. I love you so much. Mommy, when will you be back from work? I have to go see Emma again today so we can play Barbies. Yesterday was so fun with her. I was so happy I could spend time with her. Sorry, baby. I won't be able to make it home on time because of this snowstorm. But, Mommy, I made a promise to Emma that I would never miss a day. I'm so sorry, Tammy, but I can't today. Don't be sorry, Mommy. I won't break my promise to Emma. Wait, honey, what do you mean by that? Tammy? Justin, where is Tammy? I don't know. Why are you asking me? You didn't watch over your little sister. I looked over the entire house, and she's not here. And that's my problem. How? Oh, my god. I think she went to Emma's grave. Wait, how would she even be able to walk all the way over there by herself in the snow? No time for questions. Get in your car and drive to the cemetery now. Whatever. Did you find anything, Justin? I looked around. And found nothing. Oh, my god, not my Tammy! Well, actually, I did find this one thing. Two Frozen Barbies in front of Emma's Tombstone. Oh, my god, no!

Your mom's freaking out, and honestly, so am I. She called the police. I haven't told them that I lied for you. I keep telling her you're here, but I have no idea where you are. Please come home. I'm getting really worried. I asked my favorite astrology app, Astro App, for advice, and it said that I'm a cancer, so I can get really emotional when I feel abandoned. It told me to take deep breaths and focus on grounding myself so I can stay calm and clear minded while waiting to hear from you. Elio, it's been a week.

They still can't find you. I don't even know what to tell people anymore. I got a cat to help with the loneliness, I guess. I named him Charlie. Figured you'd like that. Wish you could see him.

I need to tell you this. I'm getting married. I found someone who loves me. I think you'd like him. He's the love of my life. And I'm finally getting married. I asked for star rings so you'd be here with me in some way. I miss you more than ever right now. Ilio. It's been five years. I don't know what to say anymore. But I'm still here. They closed your case, the police. No one's looking for you anymore. But I'll never stop. I'm thinking of searching for you on my own, but in secret. Oh, and I'm pregnant. It's a boy. I'm naming him Ilio, after you. Hey. Wow. I didn't even realise we're still having this conversation. It's been seven years. My son's been born. Look. I think he looks a bit like you. He's as cute as you were. Or maybe that's just me imagining things. Wish you could see him. Hey, Ellio. It's been 11 years. He's turning Four today. Time flies, doesn't it? Feels like yesterday when I last saw you. He really admires you, you know. I always tell him how great you were as a boyfriend. He says you're still alive, that we're so connected. That's why I feel like you're still around. But I don't know. Sometimes I lose faith in you coming back. I wonder if he's right. I still feel you somehow. Ello. It's been 14 years. My new boyfriend tells me I need to move on. Says I'm holding on too tight. But my son, he still believes you're coming back. He's only a kid, but he has more faith than I do by now. It's been 20 years, Elio. Wow. My boy's nine now. He's getting so big. And guess what? I'm pregnant again. With a girl. She's due in four months. And I'm naming her Julia. Like your sister. Speaking of, your sister moved back in with your parents. She's not doing well. She barely speaks to anyone. It's like everything fell apart when you left. Elio, it's been 25 years. I built the house we dreamed of. Remember that? I also got divorced, though. He cheated on me. Now it's just me, Elio, Julia, and the cat. Still waiting for you, I guess. I miss you more than I can put into words, Elio. You have no idea. Every single day. Bria. The fuck you mean? I

Yesterday, my phone rang at 2:00am. It was the police. Ma'am, we have your six year old son, Tommy at the station. He walked here by himself, saying his mommy heard his baby sister. I shot out of bed. What? Tommy's in his room sleeping. And I don't have a baby sister. Ma'am, please come down to the station immediately. I ran to Tommy's room. Empty bed, front door wide open. At the police station, Tommy was wrapped in a blanket, shaking. The moment he saw me, he screamed, don't let her take me. She killed my sister. My heart stopped. The officers looked at me like I was a monster. Tommy, buddy. What sister? It's just me and you. Remember? He kept screaming about his baby sister Sarah. How I made her go away forever. How he was scared I'd make him go away, too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room while Tommy sobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My Stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. I spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. His little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. The psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy's story never changed. Hours passed. The detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Ex explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She showed me the room. She made All pink and pretty. My blood went cold. Then one day, Mommy was crying and screaming. There was blood everywhere. And the baby went away. The psychologist looked at me. Ma'am, is there something you need to tell us?

Your mom called me asking if I knew where you were. I told her you were in my house, in the bathroom, just to cover for you. But seriously, where are you? It's been a day now. Elio. Your mom's freaking out, and honestly, so am I. She called the police. I haven't told them that I lied for you. I keep telling her you're here, but I have no idea where you are. Please come home. I'm getting really worried. I asked my favorite astrology app, Astro App, for advice, and it said that I'm a cancer, so I can get really emotional when I feel abandoned. It told me to take deep breaths and focus on grounding myself so I can stay calm and clear minded while waiting to hear from you. Elio, it's been a week. Everyone saying you're missing, like actually missing. Your mom's been crying non stop, and they filed a police report. Where are you? What's going on, Ello? It's been a month now. They still can't find you. I don't even know what to tell people anymore. I got a cat to help with the loneliness, I guess. I named him Charlie. Figured you'd like that. Wish you could see him. She's really sweet. Sleeps with me every night. She and was born on Valentine's Day, too. Ha ha ha. It's been two months since you disappeared. I stopped writing to you because it felt like screaming into the void. Your mom's Pregnant. Can you believe that? Guess there'll be another Elio around soon. I miss you so much, Elio. 10 months now. Your sister's almost here. Her name is going to be Julia. I keep hoping you'll walk through the door before she's born. Ello, it's been two years. I know that sounds insane, but part of me still thinks you're coming back. I can't move on from this. Everyone tells me to, but I can't. It's like a piece of me went missing with you. Hey. I need to tell you this. I'm getting married. I found someone who loves me. I think you'd like him. He's the love of my life. And I'm finally getting married. I asked for star rings so you'd be here with me in some way. I miss you more than ever right now. Ilio. It's been five years. I don't know what to say anymore. But I'm still here. They closed your case, the police. No one's looking for you anymore. But I'll never stop. I'm thinking of searching for you on my own, but in secret. Oh, and I'm pregnant. It's a boy. I'm naming him Ilio, after you. Hey. Wow. I didn't even realise we're still having this conversation. It's been seven years. My son's been born. Look. I think he looks a bit like you. He's as cute as you were. Or maybe that's just me imagining things. Wish you could see him. Hey, Ellio. It's been 11 years. He's turning Four today. Time flies, doesn't it? Feels like yesterday when I last saw you. He really admires you, you know. I always tell him how great you were as a boyfriend. He says you're still alive, that we're so connected. That's why I feel like you're still around. But I don't know. Sometimes I lose faith in you coming back. I wonder if he's right. I still feel you somehow. Ello. It's been 14 years. My new boyfriend tells me I need to move on. Says I'm holding on too tight. But my son, he still believes you're coming back. He's only a kid, but he has more faith than I do by now. It's been 20 years, Elio. Wow. My boy's nine now. He's getting so big. And guess what? I'm pregnant again. With a girl. She's due in four months. And I'm naming her Julia. Like your sister. Speaking of, your sister moved back in with your parents. She's not doing well. She barely speaks to anyone. It's like everything fell apart when you left. Elio, it's been 25 years. I built the house we dreamed of. Remember that? I also got divorced, though. He cheated on me. Now it's just me, Elio, Julia, and the cat. Still waiting for you, I guess. I miss you more than I can put into words, Elio. You have no idea. Every single day. Bria. The fuck you mean? I

She'll know soon enough that you're all shmine. Good. I'd never leave you anyway. Wanna grab dinner tonight? We can stop by your favorite burger place. Oh my god, yes.

I have to train the new girl tomorrow. What are the chances they put me on that? No way. Just be nice to her. Maybe you can be her friend. I don't need new friends when I have you. You're too sweet. Just don't be mean. That's all I'm saying. I'll try my best, but if she keeps asking dumb stuff, we might have a problem. Ha ha. Don't stress too much. Just try to have fun. I'm heading to bed. See you tomorrow. Hey. We didn't talk much today. How was training with Sophia? Honestly, better than I expected. She chilled out with the dumb Questions. And she's actually pretty funny. Guess what her favorite movie is. What? The incredible. What are the odds? No way! That's my favorite movie. What a crazy coincidence. She must be cool, then. I know, right? Yeah. I think you'd actually get along with her. You should talk to her. Tomorrow. Maybe. Anyway, I gotta study for a test. I'll see you tomorrow? Of course. Good luck on your test. Daniel, you barely even looked at me at work today. You were with Sophia the whole time. Babe, come on. Don't be like that. Training takes more than a day. Once it's over, you know, I'll make it up to you, I guess. Learn anything else about her? Yeah, actually. She loves sushi and she's really into working out. Cantina app. I need roast bot. My boyfriend doesn't give me attention because of a new girl. What should I do now? Just say she lifts weights, you lift excuses. She lifts weights, you lift excuses. Oof! That one hit. Use Cantina app to improve your roasting skills. Do you wanna hang out tonight? I don't think I can, babe. I was gonna hit the gym, but tomorrow for sure. Okay. I'll just stay in and watch movies then. Have fun. Talk to you later. Of course, babe. Babe, why weren't you at work today? I don't know. Just wasn't feeling great, I guess. I hope you feel better soon. Can you come over? I don't think I can, babe. Why not? You always bring me food and medicine when I'm sick. you know how some theaters bring back old movies for a limited time? Yeah. What does that have to do with anything? I can't go anywhere. I'm sick. They're playing the Incredibles. I thought I'd take Sophia to see it since she was looking for something fun to do. You're taking Sophia to see my favorite movie? Mia, don't be selfish. It's also her favorite movie. And you're sick. As you said yourself. You can't go anywhere. Wow. What's up with this girl? Why is she all you talk about now? Are you seriously trying to start an argument right now? I'm just asking. We're dating, and yet you keep talking about her. And now you're taking her to do something I've always wanted to do with you? I don't know. Maybe because she actually makes me happy and doesn't just sit around and scroll on TikTok all day. Instead, she actually does things to improve her. So. Wow. So that's how it is, right? I mean, yeah, she cares about me. I have to beg you to care about me. Okay, well, I guess we're done, then. Have fun at the movies. I will. Thanks. Mia. I just wanted to say I'm sorry for how I acted yesterday. That wasn't me. Why weren't you at work today? Still sick? I quit. What? Why? You love that job.

I can float for a couple minutes. Why? Don't move and don't leave the water no matter what. We need to clear it and evacuate everyone else. But you need to stay. What's in the water? My voice came out shaky. He didn't answer. Instead, he raised his whistle and blew three sharp blasts that echoed across the pool area. Everyone out of the pool immediately! This is not a drill! Family started rushing toward the ladders and stairs in a chaotic scramble. Kids were crying as parents hold them out! Water splashing everywhere. The shallow end emptied in seconds as people grabbed their belongings and ran. I wanted to join them, but I was stuck floating in 12 feet of water, trying not to move. Hold still. The lifeguard kept his eyes locked on the water around me. I was trying my best, but my arms were already getting tired from the careful balancing. The sun beat down, and without movement, the water felt colder. Some families had stopped at the fence instead of leaving completely. A few called out encouragement, telling me to relax and breathe and stay as still as possible. Others had their phones out, recording whatever was happening. I could see the little red lights pointing at me from multiple angles. Three other lifeguards appeared with long handled nets used for cleaning. They spread out around different parts. Of the pool, moving slowly and carefully. The one nearest to me kept a net raised, ready to strike at something. Their faces were all focused on the water, like they were hunting. My breathing quickened despite trying to stay calm. Something was in the pool with me. Something dangerous enough to evacuate everyone else, but keep me frozen in place. The lifeguards crept along the edges, scanning every inch of water. One of the lifeguards near the diving board suddenly plunged his net into the water. He struggled with something heavy, pulling and twisting the pole. The other guards rushed over to help, leaving me unwatched for terrifying seconds. Together, they hauled up their catch, and my blood went cold. An alligator thrashed in the net. Not huge. Big enough at maybe four feet. Its tail whipped back and forth as they struggled to control it. The crowd of the fence gasped, and more phones came out. Someone called animal control, while the guards care carefully carried the netted gator toward the bullhouse. But the lifeguard assigned to me didn't relax. He kept scanning the water around me with the same intensity. That's when I understood. If there was one, there might be more. Can I get out now? My voice cracked with fear. Not yet. Stay still. He pointed to something in the deep end. Dark shadow moved along the bottom, slow and purposeful. Much bigger than the one they'd caught. The guards saw it, too. They all Shifted positions, trying to get an angle with their nets, but it was too deep, too far from the edges. It's circling under her, one of them said quietly. My whole body trembled, sending ripples across the surface. The shadow continued its lazy patrol of the deep end, sometimes closer to the surface where I could make out its prehistoric shape, sometimes deeper, where it became just a dark blur against the blue. Then someone in the crowd screamed, there's another one in the shallow

My fiance Jacob and I had been together for six years, and his family invited us over to celebrate our engagement. Everything seemed normal until his sister Emma stands up and taps her glass like she's about to make some grand announcement. She disappears into the back room and comes out with this huge, huge plastic garment bag. Everyone's getting all excited, and I'm just sitting there confused as hell. Emma opens the bag and pulls out her wedding dress from two years ago. The whole family starts clapping and cheering like she just cured cancer or something. This is my official wedding gift to you, she announces. I want you to wear my dress at your wedding. My stomach just dropped. See, my mom's wedding dress has been passed down through our family for generations. I've been dreaming about wearing it since I was, like, 7 years old, trying it on in secret when mom wasn't looking. This dress wasn't just fabric to me. It was everything. I tried to smile and be polite, but apparently my face gave me away because everyone started asking what was wrong. I explained how I'd always planned to wear my mother's dress and that it was nothing personal against Emma, but I refused to wear her dress. That's when the shit hit the fan. Emma immediately starts bawling her eyes out. Jacob's parents jump All over me, asking how I could be so ungrateful and selfish. His mom actually said I was breaking tradition. Like, what tradition? They made up this tradition on the spot. I got so overwhelmed that I burst into tears and ran outside to the front steps. I'm sitting there crying for what felt like hours, expecting Jacob to come comfort me. But when he finally shows up, he's pissed. He starts yelling at me to get in the car. And the whole ride home, he's screaming about how I embarrassed him in front of his family. Then he calls me a bitchy cunt. His exact words. He said Emma was just trying to be nice and that her dress was way more modern than my mom's old rag of a dress. I tried explaining how much my mother's dress meant to me, how I'd promised her I'd wear it, but he just kept going. The worst part? I realised this whole thing was planned. They put me on the spot, thinking I'd be too polite to say no in front of everyone. Like they could just steam roll me into giving up something that meant everything to me. But here's where it gets really messed up. A week later, I'm talking to my friend Casey, who works at a bridal shop downtown. I mentioned the whole drama and she gets this weird look on her face. Wait. She says, what did the dress look like? I describe it. This Super modern strapless thing with tons of beading. Casey pulls out her phone and starts scrolling through photos. Holy shit. She whispers, showing me her screen. This dress. It's the exact same dress. Turns out Emma didn't even buy it. She rented it for her wedding. Casey remembered because Emma came in the day.

So my mother in law Beth has always been this super conservative type who watches Fox News all day and posts these crazy political rants on Facebook. Like she once told me Obama was gonna take her guns away while she was literally holding a hunting rifle. Anyway, my wife Emma and I have Learned to just nod and smile whenever she starts going off about politics. Last month was Beth's 65th birthday and Emma kept bugging me about getting her something nice. The problem is Beth is impossible to shop for because she's so picky and judgmental about everything. I was scrolling Twitter when I saw this ad for a coffee mug that said World's Okayest Conservative with this goofy cartoon elephant on it. I thought it was actually pretty harmless and funny, so I bought it as a gag gift the night before her birthday dinner. Emma saw me wrapping it up and she just rolled her eyes. Really, Jake, you're gonna give her that? But then she looked at it closer and started laughing. Okay, it's actually kind of cute. She might think it's funny too. We went to this fancy steakhouse that Beth picked out because she loves making everything about herself. The whole family was there. Emma's brother Cole, his wife Madison and their two kids who were being super loud and annoying. Beth was in her Element, ordering the most expensive thing on the menu and complaining that the bread wasn't warm enough. After dinner, we all started giving her presents. Cole got her some boring perfume. Madison gave her a scarf, and the kids made her some crayon drawings that she barely looked at. When it was my turn, I handed over the gift bag with a smile. Beth opened it up and pulled out the mug and her whole face just dropped. She stared at it for like 10 seconds while everyone else was trying to see what it was. Cole's wife, Madison, started giggling when she saw it, and even Cole cracked a smile. It's just a joke, mom, Madison said, trying to lighten the mood. It's actually pretty cute. But Beth's face was turning red and she stood up from the table without saying a word. I need to use the restroom, she announced in this really cold voice. She was walking away. Madison called out, come on, Beth, it's just for fun. That's when Beth whipped around, grabbed the mug off the table and slammed it down on the floor as hard as she could. The whole restaurant went quiet. The mug exploded into pieces and one of the sharp fragments flew up and sliced right into Beth's ankle. Blood started gushing everywhere and she started screaming about how I was a communist socialist trying to poison her mind. The restaurant manager came over, freaking out about the mess. Emma was Trying to calm her mom down while also dealing with the kids who were crying because they thought grandma was dying. I'm just standing there watching this whole disaster unfold over a stupid coffee mug. We had to call an ambulance because the cut was pretty deep and wouldn't stop bleeding. Beth needed 12 stitches and had to wear this ugly boot thing for weeks. The whole ride to the hospital, she kept ranting about how I did this on purpose to attack her values. The next day, Emma comes to me and says.

Don't let her in. She could be dangerous. She's asking me to let her in. Don't listen to her. You can't trust her right now. Oh, my god. She's pounding on the floor and screaming. She says she's going to kill Me? What do I do? Do you have the gun? Yes. Take the safety off. Shoot her if she breaks in. I can't shoot grandma only if she breaks in. Also, I know this sounds weird, but if you hear your grandma humming a strange melody, cover your ears. What? Why? There's no time to explain. Just do it. Not unless you tell me why.

He made thousands monthly, but lived in constant fear. The guilt was eating him alive. During finals, that's when we heard heavy footsteps in the hallway and loud voices approaching our door. Someone started pounding on our door, demanding we open up immediately. Jake went completely white and start and hyperventilating. This is it. They found out. I'm going to prison. We could hear multiple people outside talking about searches and evidence. Mike grabbed Jake's backpack, looking for pills to flush. Sarah was googling lawyers and deleting texts. I was trying to figure out if I could claim ignorance. Jeff remained unconscious through all the chaos, snoring peacefully. The pounding got louder and more aggressive. Open this door right now, or we're coming in anyway. Jake was having a full panic attack, gasping for air and talking about calling his parents from jail. We spent five minutes in pure terror, acting campus police to break down our door and arrest all of us. Finally, I worked up the courage to open the door and face whatever was waiting for us.

Lucas, that is the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard. Just admit you were too lazy to do the project. Take your failing grade like a man. Your family will be so disappointed in you now you won't get your scholarship, and they'll have to come out of pocket. I promise I did the project. Bailey just ruined it because I didn't want to get back with her. I don't want to hear it, Lucas. You know what else Bailey told me, Miss Geisha? She said she paid you $300 to set us up as partners. An accusation like that is blasphemous. I would never take money from a student. It's just fate that you two were paired together. Two slackers in my class. Makes sense. You think I'm gullible, Miss Geisha? Bailey told me. I'm telling the principal this if you don't make this situation right. Tell Mr. Reynolds with what proof? All you have is a message from Bailey. I'll make this work. In my favor. Whatever. Just come back to class and take your failing grade. Oh, where are you, Lucas? I just walked into class, and you're not here. I miss seeing your cute face.

Miss Geisha paired me up with my ex for the final physics project. I told her I didn't want to work with Bailey? Because she cheated on me with the entire football team. The whole football team? Dang. Yeah, but it gets worse. I needed this project to get a scholarship and take the load off my struggling family. Bailey flirted with me the entire time and distracted me from working. I did 90% of the project and dropped it off at her house to finish the rest. She fed it to her dog because I didn't want to be with her. Oh my god. How could she do something so vindictive? It gets even worse. She told me she paid Miss Geisha $300 to pair us together. Isn't that breaking some kind of school rule? That's definitely against school board guidelines. That is absolutely unacceptable behavior. But do you have any proof of this? Bailey sent me a message saying she gave Miss Geisha 300. That's not sufficient proof. Lucas, I'm sorry.

There was one teacher at my school who was infamous for teaching AP calculus like a drill sergeant. There was a rumor he once made a senior redo an entire semester's worth of tests by hand because they used the wrong kind of pencil. Unfortunately, my AP schedule didn't give me a choice. I needed that class to apply for the dual degree engineering program. So I braced myself, especially because math has always been an extra struggle for me. Everything actually went okay at first, but on the first pop quiz, I pulled out my calculator. The thing is, I have dyscalculia, which is like dyslexic. For math, it's manageable, but only with tools and time. I knew I should have gone to admin and asked for accommodations, but I'd always gotten by okay before, and I didn't want the other kids getting for engineering programs to know that I was at a disadvantage. But Mister Redding spotted me, snatched the calculator and said in front of everyone, if you need a machine to think for you, maybe this class isn't for you. I was so humiliated that I had to swallow back tears for the rest of the test. I kept my head down in class after that and never raised my hand, even when I was lost. My test came back with C's and d's, and I thought about dropping the class. One day I noticed something that changed everything. I Was in the cafeteria and realised that while all the other teachers usually came in from time to time to buy something for lunch, I never seen my math teacher there. I had to go back to my locker before lunch was over. So I thought I'd peek into his classroom just to see if he was there. I think I wanted to see him eating lunch pathetically by himself like that would make me feel better about myself or something. But I saw something else entirely. He was holding a math clinic, helping all kinds of kids from ones in our AP calculus class all the way down to the ones in remedial pre algebra. I watched him for a few minutes as he leaned over people's homework and gave advice without any of his usual snark and judgment. I didn't get it. Why would someone so harsh give up his lunch hour to teach that day? I waited until everyone had left and then stepped into his room. I told him I had dyscalculia. I explained what it was, how I.

How he was scared I'd make him go away, too. The officers separated us immediately. They put me in a cold interrogation room while Tommy sobbed in another room down the hall. The detective sat across from me. Ma'am, your son walked half a mile in the middle of the night, barefoot, to report you for murder. Six year olds don't make up stories like that. There is no other child. It's just been me and Tommy since his dad died two years ago. Then why is your son describing his sister's crib in detail? And why does he have bruises on his back? My Stomach dropped. Last week, Tommy broke my grandmother's expensive vase. I spanked him. I disciplined him. Once he broke something. The detective wrote that down. So you do hit him. I stared at him. I don't know. They brought in a child psychologist. Through the one way glass, I watched Tommy tell his story again. His little hands moving as he described. She had tiny fingers. Tommy whispered. And Mommy got really mad because she cried too much. Then one night, Mommy put her in a black bag and took her away. The psychologist asked, where did Mommy take her? To the place where people go away forever. And Tommy? Does Mommy hurt you too? She hits me when I'm bad. Just like she hurts Sarah. My hands were shaking. They searched my house at 4:00am. Tore apart every room. Called hospitals asking about missing children. Pulled my phone records, bank statements, everything. Nothing. But Tommy's story never changed. Hours passed. The detective came back looking frustrated. We can't find any evidence of another child. No birth records, no hospital visits, no purchases of baby items. Ex explain why he's terrified of you. I couldn't. At sunrise, they brought Tommy back in. The psychologist sat with us both. Tommy, can you tell me more about when your sister lived with you? Tommy's eyes filled with tears. It was before daddy died. Mommy was really happy then. She sang songs and bought tiny clothes. She showed me the room. She made All pink and pretty. My blood went cold.
