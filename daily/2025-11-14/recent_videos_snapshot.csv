Leslie Nurse says she was at the self checkout at the Sims Walmart with her husband and three kids, fighting a malfunctioning scanner, even getting help from a Walmart associate. After she thought she'd finished and paid, she was stopped by an asset Protection manager. She was eventually charged with stealing $48 worth of groceries. She was eventually arrested, mug shot taken, but the criminal charge was eventually dropped when no one from Walmart showed up to court. By then, she said, the damage to her reputation had already been done, her ability to make a living stifled by the criminal charge. What was worse, she continued to receive demand letters from a Walmart affiliated law firm offering to drop the matter if she paid them $200, but it turns out many people do. During testimony in the lawsuit she filed against the company, an expert testified Walmart routinely uses to add insult to injury, Walmart never produced a video that would have been recorded at the self checkout area that would have proved nurse shoplifted or didn't. At the end of this lawsuit, filed in 2018 and delayed by the COVID pandemic, a unanimous jury found for nurse and awarded her $2.1 million in punitive damages.

I wanted to get home right away. Son who called her to ask why she didn't mention they were getting a new roof. She says she rushed home to see a work crew had removed almost all the shingles from her home. The roofers had the wrong address and were supposed to be doing a roofing job three doors away. Campbell says there were roofing materials everywhere. They didn't just remove the shingles. They left the mess everywhere. Um, sides of the house, backyard, debris, everything. When Campbell contacted the roofing company, they admitted they made a mistake and had the wrong house. She thought they would replace her roof and she was shocked when they said no. Campbell called the police, her insurance company and another roofing contractor who put down an emergency wrap on her house to protect the roof until it can be completed. The company that took off her roof by mistake is 5 Stars Roofing of Markham. We want to be responsible for what we did. We will do her roof for free. If she wants us to do it, we can schedule it.

The barbed wire fence separated the two boys. When Bruno saw the other boy's clothes, he could not understand whether he was a prisoner or something else. The next day, Bruno packed some cakes in his bag and went back to the fence. The Jewish boy ate the cake quickly because he was very hungry. Bruno threw a basketball to play, but the boy immediately threw it back, saying it was too dangerous. Just then, a whistle blew and the boy hurried away with his garbage cart. The next morning, Bruno saw him at his house. He had been brought there to clean cups. Bruno gave him another cake. While the boy was eating, a German soldier came and shouted at him loudly. Bruno got scared and lied that he didn't know the boy. When he returned to his room, he felt guilty and started crying. The next day when he went back to the fence, the boy's face was bruised. Bruno said sorry. From that day, they became good friends. Every day they played chess across the fence. One day, some German officers were watching a documentary. Bruno climbed up to a window and looked inside. The film showed the Jewish people in the camp looking happy and safe. After seeing that, Bruno believed the movie. He took a shovel, went to the fence, wore striped pajamas like the Prisoners and tried to hide as one of them, Bruno, dug a hole under the fence and slipped inside the camp. But the camp looked nothing like the movie. Everyone there was sad and tired. The two boys kept walking and saw a hall full of prisoners. Suddenly, soldiers came and took everyone outside. At the same time, Bruno's mother realized he was missing. His father ordered soldiers to find him. They soon reached the camp, but Bruno had already been taken to a dark room. Everyone was told to take off their clothes. The two boys, shaking with fear, held each other's hands tightly and the soldiers released gas. After some time, there was complete silence inside. When Bruno's father arrived, it was already too late. The whole family was broken. In the end, that innocent boy.

But the wife thought the sweater looked too small. She asked him to stand up and turn around. When he refused to get up, the wife began to worry. Suddenly, the man froze. No matter how she called out, he didn't respond at all. Only then did she realize the network signal was bad, so she hung up the phone. In reality, the pattern on the back of the sweater was not finished yet. A while later, the wife sensed something was wrong and video called him again. Suddenly, a wig fell onto his face. The wife instantly noticed the strange situation and was about to question him, but the man froze again, completely motionless. The villagers behind him also held their breath. The wife thought the network had frozen again. She walked around the house looking for a signal, and after repeatedly trying without success, she hung up the phone. Only then did everyone dare to breathe a sigh of relief. It turned out the husband had lied to his wife that he was studying art in a big city. In reality, he was teaching in a remote Mountain Village. Every time his wife called, he pretended to be at a city landmark, relying entirely on the villagers to help him cover up the truth. But one day, while visiting a newly opened resort, his wife glimpsed a notice Board at the village entrance covered by something. Curiosity drove her to lift the cover and she was shocked to see her husband's photo posted on it. She stood still on the spot, then went straight to her husband's workplace. The villagers were terrified to see her appear. One person hastily put on a wig as a disguise and another tried to secretly pass a message to the husband, but was caught by the wife on the spot. Looking around, she could hardly believe her eyes. This entire scene was an elaborate setup by her husband.

And all of your friends that you went to high school with, they're married and they work for Dell and they have four 1K and they have stock options and your mom's driving you to NA meetings and you're 26 or you're 30 or you're 34, and you've never once had any idea about what to do in this. On this spinning rock, bro, this is crazy. That was me, bro. Oh my. All the way up until probably 29 years old. Here's what I will say to people watching this that have no clue that. That have no clue what they wanna do, how they wanna do it. Cause I was there. I was just there. Let me give you something. I started trying things. I knew I had something and I didn't know what it was, but I knew I had something. And let me tell you this. If you've made it through addiction or mental illness, you have something cause a lot of people don't. If you are still kicking today, battling those demons, you have something. Cause a lot of people didn't wake up today cause they couldn't make it, they couldn't cut it. And you fucking did. So you have something, but you might not know what it is. The happiest dude in the room, ask him how he's doing. For real. A lot of people don't ask me cause to the point that I'm always happy, I'm laughing, I'm Bullshit, you know, always brightening everyone else's day. His day must be fine because he's brightening everybody else's life. I would say that's not a fact. That person that brightens other people's lives, they're just good at brightening people's day, and they still have issues.

But if I can't get that same energy back, I promise you, I start telling somebody else my problem, I go find somebody who can fix. Don't send me to that place, cause when I get there, I never come back from. Believe it. I take mental health real serious, cause I ain't gonna lie. I'm being like, messed up. Like why? At least I thought I was messed up. I just going through shit, but like, everybody go through shit sometimes. Should be getting overlooked.

She says she rushed home to see a work crew had removed almost all the shingles from her home. The roofers had the wrong address and were supposed to be doing a roofing job three doors away. Campbell says there were roofing materials everywhere. They didn't just remove the shingles. They left the mess everywhere. Um, sides of the house, backyard, debris, everything. When Campbell contacted the roofing company, they admitted they made a mistake and had the wrong house. She thought they would replace her roof and she was shocked when they said no. Campbell called the police, her insurance company and another roofing contractor who put down an emergency wrap on her house to protect the roof until it can be completed. The company that took off her roof by mistake is 5 Stars Roofing of Markham. We want to be responsible for what we did. We will do her roof for free. If she wants us to do it, we can schedule it.

Then I stopped a boy who was about to get off. I tried to signal him for help, but Jack is a college kid with very bad eyesight. By the time he put on his glasses and read my message, unfortunately, my husband had already woken up from his stupor. Luckily, John didn't notice anything unusual. But seeing John's fierce expression, Jack, knowing he couldn't win, had to hurriedly get off. Still facing this rare chance, I mustered the courage to take off my headscarf and quickly wrote the rescue message on the scarf with lipstick. Then, while John wasn't looking, I swiftly tossed the scarf next to the driver. I thought the driver would notice right away, but to my surprise, the driver actually picked up the scarf and came over to me. He angrily scolded me for littering. Just as John was about to grab the scarf back. I feared our plan would be exposed, so I snatched the scarf back immediately. Then I hurriedly apologized to the driver, saying maybe the wind had blown it there by accident. Even so, John was still extremely displeased. But this was a public place. John could only wait until we got home to deal with me. Just when I felt hopeless and helpless, unexpectedly, Jack came back again. This time he asked the driver to wait before departing because one of his classmates was still on the way. But the driver Didn't want to break the schedule for them. Yet at Jack's request and afterwards, Jack offered to pay an extra waiting fee. The driver finally agreed to wait. As Jack walked past me again, he secretly showed me the writing on his palm. That's when I realized Jack had come back to rescue me. But until nightfall, the driver still hadn't waited for Jack's classmate. Facing complaints from other passengers, the driver decided he wouldn't wait any longer. When Jack tried to step forward to negotiate with the driver unexpectedly, he had an asthma attack and collapsed to the ground. The driver, terrified, immediately stopped what he was doing and ran over with a first aid kit to check on him. Seeing Jack wasn't doing well, he urgently asked if there was a doctor. Fortunately, John is a surgeon. But just as he was about to examine Jack, he realized the man in front of him was the same guy who had stared at me that morning. And John seemed to see through Jack's intentions. Soon he noticed the SOS message written on my leg. Faced with my bold move, angry John was about to scold Jack for meddling. The next second, I was behind him with a fire extinguisher. Before he could react, I smashed the extinguisher down on his head. Unfortunately, John didn't get knocked out. Instead, it only fired up her anger even more. Just as John got up to punish us again, the police arrived in Time and immediately restrained John.

When they scanned it, three agents surrounded me. Ma'am, this passport was reported lost 12 years ago. I was 22, heading to Toronto for a job interview. It was my first real shot at a corporate position after graduating, and I'd spent weeks preparing. My hands were shaking as I handed over my passport, not from nerves about the interview, but because I hate flying. The agent scanned it, paused, and again, then ran it through a third time. She looked up at me with this expression I'll never forget. Half confusion, half alarm. Can you step aside, please? My stomach dropped. I watched other passengers move through security while I stood frozen by the metal detector. Two more agents appeared within seconds. One of them was older, maybe in his 50s, with this stern face that made me want to cry. Ma'am, come with us. They pulled me into a small office behind the security checkpoint. White walls, two chairs, desk with a computer. The door closed behind me with a heavy click. When did you last use this passport? Last summer. I went to Greece with friends. Why? What's wrong? The older agent sat down across from me, holding his hands on the desk. This passport was reported lost in 2012 by a Diane Fletcher. That's you, correct? Yes, but I've never reported anything lost. I've had this passport since I was 16. I've used it multiple times. They Exchanged glances. The younger agent left the room without saying anything. I sat there for 20 minutes, watching the clock, knowing I was about to miss my flight. My phone buzzed with text from the recruiter asking if I'd boarded yet. I couldn't answer. They'd taken my phone. Finally, the older agent returned with a stack of printed documents, spread them across the desk like he was revealing cards in a poker game. We need to ask you something. Do you know a woman named Patricia Fletcher? My blood went cold. That's my aunt. My mom's younger sister. The fun aunt who always brought expensive gifts to Christmas, who took me shopping for my prom dress, who I'd known my entire life. She's my aunt. Why? Patricia Fletcher reported this? Passports

Then my sister's new husband shook my hand and froze. He turned pale, looked me up online, and suddenly everyone went silent. My dad likes to pretend I don't exist. Not in the dramatic you're dead to me kind of way. That would have taken effort. No, he just slowly erased me, left me out of conversations, family photos, even holiday seating charts. Wanted a son who wore cuff links and talked about sales quotas over golf. Instead, he got me, the college dropout who started bartending at 22 and never stopped. To him, that made me a failure, a joke. And he made sure everyone else in the family knew it, too. So I stopped showing up to events, quietly cut myself out of their perfect little photo ops until last weekend, my sister Tessa's wedding. Fancy venue, marble floors, chandeliers that could kill a man. I wasn't invited to the engagement party or the bridal shower, but I did get a formal wedding invite from my mom, probably because Grandpa Harold, the only person in the family who actually likes me, threatened not to attend if I wasn't invited. So I showed up, black suit, clean shave, no entourage, plan to blend in, smile and leave before dessert. But of course, that didn't happen. First thing I hear walking in, my dad's voice, already drunk, already talking shit. Oh, Julian, you mean the bartender? He's probably mixing Rum and Cokes in some club downtown. He wouldn't last 10 minutes in a place like this. Everyone laughed, even my mom. I didn't say a word, just clenched my jaw and walked in like I hadn't heard it. My hands were shaking, not from embarrassment, from holding back. The bride and groom made their big entrance. Tessa looked surprised to see me. James, her new husband, didn't know who I was, not yet. Eventually, they made their rounds and came up to me. Tessa smiled like it hurt. Julian didn't know you were coming. You invited me, I said. She glanced away. James stuck out his hand. Nice to meet you, he said. I'm Julian. He blinked. Wait. Last name same as hers. He stared at me, then pulled out his phone like he got a message. But I saw him typing, searching. His eyes darted from the screen to me, back again. He went pale, jaw clenched, then mumbled something about getting a drink and walked off. Tessa looked confused. What was that about? I shrugged. No idea now.

Yes, I started as a bartender, but what no one in my family ever bothered to ask is that I built a liquor brand seven years ago. Started small, got lucky. One viral ad, one celebrity tweet, one distributor deal, and we took off. By 29, I bought out my partner. By 30, I had contracts across three continents. I don't pour drinks anymore. I own the drinks. My company employs 60 people. The tequila being served at the wedding bar, that's mine. But none of them knew because none of them cared to ask until that night. James whispered to his brother, then to his dad, then to a groomsman. I saw phones come out. Whisper spread like wildfire. Then my dad came over. Julian, he said, smiling too hard. Didn't expect to see you here. You invited me. I said again. Right, right. Still bartending, huh? I snapped. I haven't touched a shaker in five years. But the tequila in your glass, that's mine. He laughed, joking. I didn't say a word. Just walk to the bar. Hey, I asked the bartender. You guys using kikes for the house tequila? Yeah, he grinned. Kikes, Blanco, that stuff smooth. You tried it. I'm the founder. He stared. Wait, no shit. I nodded. Shit. I didn't even have to turn around to know my dad was right behind me listening to every word. Face melting. After that, the whole Vibe changed. I saw him storm over to my mom. She looked like someone just told her the earth was flat. Tessa tried to play it cool, but she was shaken. People were googling me under the table. A groomsman pulled up my Forbes article, The Bartender Who Built a Liquor Empire. And just like that, I was no longer invisible. Cousins I hadn't seen in years started popping up, old uncles. One aunt who once told me I'd never make it without a degree tried to hug me like we were besties. I ignored all of them. But the best part, watching my dad standing off to the side, drink untouched, looking like he just found out the family dog could talk and never liked him either. I, I didn't speak to him again. I didn't need to. I stayed just long enough for the whispers to turn into headlines, just long enough for everyone who'd laughed at me to realize they've been laughing at the wrong man. And then I left. No big exit, no goodbye speech, just gone. But you want to know what really made it perfect? Later that night, my sister texted me. Did you really have to humiliate him like that? I replied, did I or did the truth do that all on its own? She didn't respond, but I already knew the answer.

And when I confronted her, my wife snapped, she's not your daughter. Don't correct her. I just smiled. The next morning, I canceled her university payments, credit card and car insurance. I was hosting Sunday dinner with my mom, two brothers and their wives. My wife, Darcy was laughing with my sister in law. Her daughter, Giselle, 23, who I've been bankrolling for four years, was glued to her phone. My mom asked Giselle how classes were going. One word response, no eye contact. I spoke up. She's in her senior year majoring in communications. Giselle's head snapped up. Stop acting like you know anything about my life. You're not my dad. You're just some guy my mom married, four years of writing checks summed up in one sentence. My brother's froze. My mom's face went from shocked to angry. My wife's reaction, not horror, just embarrassment. I didn't say a word, just filed it away. After everyone left, I found Giselle in her room. What you said was disrespectful, she laughed. I don't owe you anything. You're not family. Darcy appeared in the doorway. She's not your daughter. Stop trying to discipline her. I looked at my wife, the same woman who once cried about how grateful she was for her daughter's stability. I smiled. Message received. I walked to my office. I met Darcy five years ago, single mom. Her ex disappeared when Giselle was 6. We married after 14 months. I covered every expense. When Giselle got accepted to university, I told her not to worry about tuition, bought her a car for graduation, paid for her apartment. Every semester I paid the Bill. Four years. Two hundred fifty thousand dollars. Tuition, 18,000 per semester. Apartment, 12,000 yearly. Car insurance, 2,000. Credit card averaging 800 monthly, plus laptop, textbooks, furniture. And when I asked for basic respect, you're just some guy. That night I didn't sleep. At 3:00am, I pulled up paperwork, our title, my name, university portal, my account, apartment lease, my name, phone, credit card and insurance also mine. Everything ran through me. They saw it as obvious.

Are you hooking up with Mister Miller? It started the day I stood up in the middle of his class. You see, no one interrupts Mister Miller. He writes in cursive like it's 1850, calls us by our last names, and he even once gave detention for yawning. The man treats his classroom like a military base. No bathroom passes, no exceptions. So when I stood up right in the middle of his monologue about supply chains and said, bathroom, the entire room froze. Miller didn't even flinch. He just nodded and said, go ahead. That silence was unreal. You could hear the hum of the fluorescent lights. Someone dropped a pen and actually whispered, did he just let her go? Another said, no way. No one gets to leave. When I came back, everyone was staring at me like I. I just hacked the school's mainframe. By next period, it got worse. Miss Parker's version of strict isn't yelling, it's psychological warfare. She smiles while she crushes you. If you ask to go to the bathroom, she'll tilt her head and say, do you really need to? In the same tone dentists use before a root canal. She has a laminated red sign above her desk that says no bathroom breaks during class. And Comic Sans, like the font, makes it friendly. Halfway through her lecture, I stood up again. Didn't even raise my hand. Just grabbed my Stuff. And said bathroom. She looked at me, pause for half a second inside, and waved me out. No hesitation, no lecture. When I came back, my best friend was waiting in the hallway with eyes wide, like I just walked out of an interrogation. What do you have on them? She hissed. On who? Mr. And Miller. Miss Parker. You've got dirt on them, right? Are you? She lowered her voice. Are you screwing one of them? I froze because I definitely wasn't. And I definitely didn't have dirt on anyone. But explaining the real reason that wasn't happening. So I said the first thing that came into my head. You have to read them. Watch their micro expressions. She blinked. Like psychology. Exactly. I had no idea what I was talking about. It was better than the truth. By lunch, half the school knew. Words spread like wildfire. I'd cracked the teacher code. People were saying I could predict how a teacher would react before they even open their mouth. One kid called me the reader. Another said I'd mastered behavioral compliance. Got ridiculous fast. The next day, a group dared me to try it on Mrs. Hoffman. The meanest teacher in the building. She's the reason everyone in AP Bio develops anxiety. She once made a kid cry for asking to sharpen his pencil during a test. So naturally, I agreed. Half the class turned to watch. I waited until the

Mom was passed out at the kitchen table, laptop opened to a poker site surrounded by energy drink cans. The electricity had been shut off. There was $14 in Mom's bank account and $8,000 in new poker debts from that week. I drove back with Aunt Jessica. A social worker was documenting everything. Mom sat on the couch, suddenly sober, suddenly aware. She looked at me with desperate hope. I turned to the social worker instead. I have documentation, I said. Photos from Monday, text messages where my mother told me to leave her, social media posts, bank statements showing the gambling. Mom's face went from hopeful to horrified. You set me up, she whispered. No, I said, I gave you exactly what you asked for. A week without me, you proved you can't handle it. But they're my children. Then act like their mother. Within two hours, my siblings were packing their bags. Aunt Jessica was already a licensed foster parent. As we loaded the car, my brother hugged my waist so tight I could barely breathe. You came back, he whispered. I never left, I told him. I just let mom show everyone who she really was. That was six months ago. Mom completed a court ordered program and sees the kids twice a month with supervision. She tells anyone who'll listen that I destroyed our family. But my brother can read now. My sister joined the soccer team. They eat three Meals a day and sleep in clean beds. Last week, mom asked if I'd consider letting them come home, said she'd changed, said she'd stopped gambling. I checked her bank statements. She'd withdrawn $600 in cash advances three days before. Sometimes people need to fail spectacularly before they can change. Sometimes they don't change at all. Either way, my siblings are safe. Mom wanted life to be better without me. For my siblings, it finally is.

Didn't know you'd be here. Small world. I nodded. Good to see you, David. He turned to the room. I'm guessing no one here knows that your sister is the reason our entire division didn't collapse last quarter. Complete silence. She's the consultant we brought in to fix our marketing strategy after the Riley campaign disaster. You remember that, Claire? Claire's mouth opened, closed. Your sister worked 18 hour days for two months. Saved us millions, rebuilt our entire acquisition funnel and personally pitched the revised campaign to the client. My mom looked confused. Dad's face was red. In fact, she's so good, we've hired her for three more projects this year. The board specifically requested her by name. He looked at me. Still not interested in coming on board full time? I smiled. I like my freedom. Can't blame you, though. We pay you twice what we pay Claire here. That last part hung in the air like a bomb. My aunt found her phone fascinating. My uncle coughed. Claire stood there, face red, hands shaking. David checked his watch. I should go. Just wanted to drop off that contract for the Singapore project. He handed me an envelope. Board approved the budget. 200,000 for six months. It's yours if you want it. I took it. Thanks. I'll look it over. Perfect. And Claire? He turned to my sister. Don't forget our check in Monday morning. I'll need your Q3 numbers ready. He Nodded to everyone. Nice meeting you all. Enjoy the party. He left. The silence was deafening. I looked at my sister, at her perfect makeup, her designer dress, her carefully curated life that she just used to humiliate me. Enjoy your party, I said quietly. I walked out. My phone started buzzing before I reached my car. Mom, why didn't you tell us? Dad, we had no idea you were working with Claire's company. Aunt Linda, I always knew you were doing well. Claire, we need to talk. Please. I turned my phone off. When I got home, I opened the envelope. Contract for the Singapore project. Six months, $200,000. At the bottom, a sticky note in David's handwriting. Claire tried to pitch for this project last week. Board said no. They want you. Thought you should know.

My family laughed until her boss walked in, looked at me and said, hi, boss. The entire room froze. My sister Claire has always been the golden child, senior marketing manager at a major tech firm, BMW, Downtown Loft. I'm a freelance consultant who works from home in sweatpants. At her 32nd birthday party last Saturday, she decided to remind everyone of that difference. I brought a book as a gift. She opened it in front of everyone. A book. How thoughtful. I guess when you don't have a real job, you have lots of time to read. A few people laughed, forced to smile. I thought you'd enjoy it. I'm sure I would if I had time to sit around all day like some people. She turned to our cousin. Unlike my sister, I actually have to work for a living. More laughter. My mom chimed in. Claire's been so busy with her promotion, project deadlines, client meetings. Dad nodded. We're very proud. Not everyone can handle that kind of responsibility. Not everyone. Meaning me. Claire smiled. Exactly. Some people are built for success. Others glanced at me. Others are just kind of there. Glared it into sing. My face burned. I run my own business, Claire. Oh, please. You do freelance consulting from your couch. That's not a business. That's a hobby that occasionally pays. I make good money doing what? Giving people Advice they could Google. At least I contribute something meaningful. He turned to her friends. My little sister thinks emailing corporations makes her important. It's adorable, someone snorted. You're 30 years old, no office, no team, no benefits. Mom and dad are too polite to say it, but we're all thinking it. She paused. When are you going to get a real job? You're useless at this whole career thing. Useless. I grabbed my coat. Oh, don't be so sensitive, Claire called. I'm just being honest. I was halfway to the door when it opened. A man in a suit walked in, mid 40s. Confidence dried. David Chen, Claire's boss, EP of her entire division. She'd pointed him out once, talked about how intimidating he was. He stopped when he saw me, then smiled. Hi, boss. The entire room froze. Claire's face went white. What, Dave?

I was 19 when dad died, heart attack at 52. One minute he was mowing the lawn, the next he was gone. My stepmom found him face down in the grass, his hand still gripping the mower handle. She called 9, 1 1 first, then her kids. I got a text three hours later. Your father passed. Funeral arrangements to follow. No. Sorry. No. Are you okay? Just facts. The funeral was small. My stepmom's family took up three entire rows. I sat alone in the back. After the reception, she pulled me aside. Your father and I were married for 15 years. You were away at college most of that time. The house, the savings, the investments, all of it goes to me and my children. That's how marriage works. She handed me a box. Your father's watch, some photos, his military medals. That's your inheritance. Be grateful you're getting anything at all. Three weeks later, I got a call from Morrison and Associates. They needed me for the formal reading of the will. I almost didn't go. My stepmom had made it clear where I stood. But something made me show up. The office was downtown, 14th floor. My stepmom was already there with her two kids. They looked annoyed I'd come, taking up space you don't deserve, her daughter muttered. The lawyer opened a folder to my Wife, I leave the house and $50,000 from my life insurance to my stepchildren, $10,000 each. My stepmom smiled to my daughter. I leave everything else, my investment portfolio valued at approximately $890,000, my retirement accounts, my classic car collection, the lake cabin, and the contents of my personal safety deposit box. The room went silent. My stepmom stood so fast, her chair fell backward. That's impossible.

The dress code got updated again. No highlighting elements on periodic table shirts. That's when I had my masterpiece idea. I showed up wearing a plain white T-shirt with a Q R code on it. Jake, what's that Q R code for? It's my digital portfolio. Mr Johnson, very professional and educational. What he didn't know was that the Q R code LED to a 10 hour loop of someone saying fried chicken, different accents. By lunch, half the school had scanned my shirt and the hallways were filled with kids whispering fried chicken in British, Australian and southern accents. Jake, that Q R code is about fried chicken, sir. You can't. And Q R codes their technology. We're supposed to embrace digital learning. Mr Jonathan banned Q R codes on clothing. So my friend Lisa showed up with a shirt covered in seemingly random dots. Turns out it was Braille that spelled I want some fried chicken right now. Lisa, what's with the dots? It's Braille, sir. I'm supporting accessibility and inclusion for visually impaired students. What does it say? I don't know. I don't read Braille. I just thought it looked educational. Mr Jonathan had to call in the school nurse who knew Braille to translate it. When she read it out loud, the entire office burst into laughter. Mr Jonathan banned Braille on clothing. The final straw came when darkest showed up wearing a Shirt with a beautiful landscape painting. It looked completely innocent until you realized the clouds were shaped like chicken drumsticks, the mountains looked like chicken breasts and the trees resembled chicken wings. Darkest, that's a landscape? Yes, sir. It's art appreciation. I'm celebrating nature and creativity. The clouds look like chicken, sir. That sounds like a personal problem. I just see beautiful cumulus formations. Mr Jonathan stared at the shirt for five minutes trying to find a rule to ban artistic interpretations of chicken shaped clouds. That afternoon, he called an emergency assembly. Students, I'm scrapping the entire dress code. The whole auditorium cheered. But if I see one more piece of fried chicken imagery, coded message, QR code, Braille reference or chicken shaped cloud, you're all getting detention. Darkest raised his hand. Mr Jonathan, what if we just bring actual fried chicken for lunch? That's, that's fine. Just eat it normally. The next day, half the school brought fried chicken for lunch. The cafeteria smelled amazing. And Mr Jonathan finally understood that banning something just makes teenagers more creative.

My high school has the most ridiculous dress code in existence. Last year they banned everything fun. So my friends and I decided to get creative with loopholes. It started when they banned distracting clothing. The principal, Mr Jonathan, was tired of kids wearing funny t shirts, so he made this vague rule about appropriate attire. My friend Darcus immediately found the first loophole. He showed up wearing a three piece suit with a tie that had tiny fried chicken drumsticks printed on it. Mr Jonathan, you said no distracting clothing. This is formal business attire. Darkest, that tie has fried chicken on it. Sir, chicken is a respectable protein source. This tie represents my commitment to nutrition education. Mr Jonathan couldn't argue with a kid in a full suit, so darkest got away with it. The next day, half the school showed up in formal wear with ridiculous patterns. It's with pizza ties, dresses with taco prints, blazers covered in tiny hamburgers. This is not what I meant. Mr Jonathan announced over the intercom. So he updated the rule, no clothing with food imagery. That's when my friend Sarah got brilliant. She showed up wearing a shirt that said, I love mathematics with a giant equation that when solved spelled out fried chicken in numbers. Sarah, that shirt is about fried chicken. No, sir, it's about mathematics. I'm showing school spirit by celebrating academic subjects. The equation spells out Fried chicken only if you solve it correctly, which shows I'm encouraging mathematical literacy. Mr Jonathan was getting frustrated, so he banned coded message is too. My friend Tommy responded by wearing a shirt with the periodic table, but he highlighted specific elements that spelled F, R, I, E, d, C, H, I, C, K, E, N. Tommy, that's still about fried chicken, sir. This is the periodic table. I'm promoting science education. If you see fried chicken in the elements, that's your interpretation. You highlighted specific letter.

It was me, the one keeping the household running. For two years after dad died, I'd been doing everything, waking the kids for school, making meals, helping with homework while mom sat at her laptop draining our accounts. Monday morning, I was making breakfast when mom shuffled in, eyes bloodshot. You think you're so perfect, she said, acting like you're the parent here. If I'm such a burden, I can leave, I offered quietly. Her face lit up. Yeah, maybe that would be best for everyone. Fine, I said. I'll stay with Aunt Jessica for a week. You handle everything. Before I left, I photographed every unpaid Bill, the empty fridge, the overflowing trash, the homework sheets my brother couldn't read, the checkbook showing $47, the credit card statements with $12,000 in cash advances to poker sites. Day 1, mom posted on social media about finally having peace, how teenagers were so dramatic. Day 2, my sister called whispering, mom forgot to pick us up from school. We waited for two hours. Day 3, my brother called crying, there's no food. I'm so hungry. Can you walk to Missus Chen's house, I asked. She'll feed you. Thursday morning, Aunt Jessica got a call from CPS. A teacher reported both kids came to school in dirty clothes, clearly hungry. A neighbor called about children crying on the porch at midnight. When the social worker arrived, my brother was making cereal with water because the milk had gone bad.

He sits us down and says very gravely, Jade needs to increase her protein intake immediately. Her body needs complete proteins to handle chemotherapy. Jade crosses her arms. I'm not eating animals. Find another way. Doctor Gabe blinks. Jade, this is life or death. You need at least eight, 80 grams of protein daily. Then I'll die with a clear conscience. The next week was like a sitcom from hell. My wife tried sneaking chicken broth into Jade's soup. Jade took one sip, spit it out and yelled, mom, this tastes like blood. I attempted hiding ground Turkey in her spaghetti sauce. She took one bite, ran to the bathroom and came back with a toothbrush. I need to scrub the death from my mouth. We brought in a nutritionist who suggested protein powder. Jade screamed, way, protein? That's cow juice powder. You're trying to turn me into a dairy vampire. By week two, Jade had lost 8 pounds and Doctor Gabe was getting desperate. He tried reasoning with her. Jade, even plants want to live. You're still ending life. Jade gasped dramatically. Did you just compare a carrot to a cow? A carrot doesn't have feelings, Doctor Gabe, how do you know? Because carrots don't have faces. Then my wife had this brilliant idea. She went to this fancy vegan restaurant and explained the situation. The chef created these protein shakes that looked like green smoothies but were packed with pea protein, hemp hearts and spirulina. Jade drank them religiously, calling them her life force elixirs. Her protein levels shot up. But here's where it gets absolutely hilarious. Jade needed a minor surgery to insert her chemo port. When she woke up from anesthesia, she was completely loopy. The nurse brought her some chicken broth to help with nausea. Still high as a kite, Jade took a big sip and went, hmm, this is the best vegetable broth ever. What kind of vegetables taste this good? My wife and I are dying trying not to laugh. The nurse whispers. Should I tell her? I shake my head frantically. Jade finishes the entire cup and asks for more. This magical vegetable juice is healing my.

My nine year old daughter Beatrix got expelled from her school's Disney graduation trip for destroying $2,000 worth of property. The PTA president's voice was vicious when she called me from Magic Kingdom. Missus Burnett, if you're not at Disney World within three hours, I'm calling the police myself. Your daughter has destroyed thousands of dollars of property. She's ruined our entire graduation Celebration that we spent months planning. This is criminal destruction and she will, will be prosecuted to the fullest extent. I could hear other parents shouting in the background. Is that her mother? Tell her she's paying for everything. I dropped everything and drove three hours to Orlando, my heart pounding nonstop. Beatrix had begged to go on this fifth grade graduation trip as a single mom working as a nurse. thousand dollar trophy had meant taking extra shifts for two months, but she promised to behave. The PTA president called twice more during my drive. This is assault. Your daughter is deeply disturbed. When I arrived at Disney security, I found Beatrix sitting on a bench holding orange craft Scissors. Around her feet were the remains of what had once been beautiful Mickey ears. Her chin was up. She wasn't crying. The P t. A. President, Missus Hodges was pacing frantically with her phone out recording everything. This is assault on personal property. These ears cost $75 each. Some were Limited edition. The other mothers were gathering their children, faces twisted in anger and disbelief. I recognized the Harmon's who owned three country clubs, the O'Brien's, whose foundation name was on our school gym, the kind of parents who flew first class to P t a. Meetings. Beatrix, what happened, I asked. Kneeling beside her, I fixed something that was broken. Mom, Mrs. Hodges shoved her phone in my face. Your daughter is disturbed. She ran through the group with Scissors like a maniac. She destroyed 27 pairs of Mickey ears during our castle photo. The other parents started shouting about lawsuits, therapy bills, ruined memories. One mother claimed her daughter was traumatized and would never return to Disney. Beatrix, I need you to explain exactly what happened, I said quietly. She looked up at me with that steady gaze that always made her seem older than 9. Mom, they made kids earn their ears. Kids whose parents couldn't donate extra money had to work for them. Missus Hyatt just stepped forward. We created a responsibility system. Children Learned the value of effort and contribution, but they made us clean up after the rich kids at every meal. Beatrix continued, her voice getting stronger. Carry their bags in the 98 degree heat, throw away their trash, wipe down tables while they went on rides, pick up their dropped popcorn. After three days, they decided if we worked hard enough to deserve ears. My stomach began to twist. Go on, sweetheart. Alfred cleaned up vomit when Zack threw up after Space Mountain. Beatrix's eyes started to water. Olivia carried shopping bags for six hours until her arms had red marks. Carlos missed the parade because he was holding spots in line for other kids to ride Thunder Mountain twice. His mom couldn't donate because she's paying for his grandmother's medicine. The security guard shifted uncomfortably. Mrs. Hodges's confident expression was faltering. They gave me plastic ears after I cleaned for three days. But Alfred's dad has cancer and his mom used all their savings for treatment, couldn't donate anything extra. Alfred worked harder than anyone. He smiled while cleaning. He ran to get napkins. He carried bags until his shoulders hurt. The other parents were looking at the ground. Now, yesterday, the moms announced that didn't earn his ears because he looked tired while working. They said he wasn't enthusiastic for the castle photo. Kids with custom ears stood in front, kids with plastic ears stood in the back. Alfred had to be on the side holding everyone's backpacks. No ears, one of the other mothers whispered. The photos were supposed to be a surprise for parents. Beatrix's voice cracked. They made him watch while they gave Alina three pairs of ears because her mom bought the whole group fast passes. Lena threw one pair away at Alfred's head because she didn't like the color. So during the photo, I cut them all, every expensive pair, every crystal, every embroidered name. If Alfred couldn't have ears after being treated like a servant at Disney World, then nobody deserve. I had to turn away to hide my expression, Missus Hodges sputtered. She destroyed our private property. There are consequences. What happened to the kids who cleaned, I asked? Missus Hodges hesitated. They, they still participated in all park activities, another mother interjected quickly. The Bronze Tier children couldn't enter certain restaurants or character meetings. For logistics, they weren't allowed to ride rides with fast passes, even with their own money, Beatrix added quietly. Alfred ends up getting a VIP experience and his first Mickey ears ever.

But his decision backfired right away. We've been married 11 years. I'm 40. Work I T. Support for a local company. He's 42. Accountant at a downtown firm. Normal marriage. Friday movie, nights in chores, occasional beach vacations. Nothing glamorous, but we were solid. Or so I thought. Six months ago, he joined this expensive gym downtown. $200 monthly membership, personal trainer three times weekly, fancy meal prep, delivery service. I supported it completely. He'd been talking about getting healthier for years, and I was genuinely proud when he started losing weight. First 20 pounds, he was excited and motivated. By 67 pounds lost, he was a completely different person. Designer athletic wear, expensive Cologne, posting gym selfies constantly. Then the comments started. Not everyone lets themselves go after marriage. Some people peek in their 20s and just coast. He'd say this while flexing in the mirror, dead serious. At a work event, I wore a dress I'd had for years. He said, are you really wearing that? I guess it doesn't matter much at this point. Another time, he told me I should have focused on myself years ago instead of settling down so young. The remarks got crueler every week. Then one Saturday morning, he walked into the kitchen in his gym clothes and said, I'm not happy. I need to explore other options. I'm filing for divorce. I literally froze with the coffee. Pot in my hand. What? Why? What's wrong? He looked at me like I was stupid. Look at me now. I have a whole world of opportunities. I'm not stuck with you anymore. I've outgrown this marriage. The audacity was breathtaking. A week later, his lawyer sent official papers. He wanted the house, half my savings and spousal support. Even though he made 85 K the year, exact same as me. Plus another 20 K day from side consulting work. I called a divorce lawyer immediately. She reviewed everything and said, he's asking for way more than he's entitled to. This is pure entitlement. I told her I wasn't rolling over if he wanted a fight.

I made one rule that silenced them all. During my 30th birthday party, my wife surprised me with a roast and rule game. Twenty guests each got to make one rule I had to follow. It started funny. Jake must hop on one foot when getting drinks. Then escalated, Jake can't speak unless spoken to. My best friend added, Jake must kneel when anyone snaps their fingers. Within minutes, I was literally on my knees hopping to serve drinks while staying silent. My wife was filming everything, saying it'd be hilarious on Instagram. They made me wear a paper crown labeled Birthday Fool and do 10 push UPS every time someone said party. I was dripping sweat, humiliated while everyone filmed and laughed. That's when my brother in law added the final insult, Jake must thank us for each rule. I stood up, smiled and announced my turn. One rule to override all they laughed. Phone's ready. Nobody can use their phone, eat, drink or sit down unless they individually compliment me first and it has to be genuine. I'll know if you're faking. Dead silence. Then the panic. My sister reached for her phone, stopped. My buddy went for his beer, frozen. Within 10 minutes, I had grown adults giving heartfelt speeches about my character just to check their texts. My wife tried sitting and had to stand back up, finally admitting, you're actually the most patient man. I Know by midnight, I'd received over 200 genuine compliments. The birthday fool crown became birthday king. Now every party someone asks, we're not doing rules again, right? Sometimes one perfect rule beats 20 cruel ones.

That hour long conversation with my best friend never happened. I spent the whole day trying to make sense of it. The breakup felt so real. I remembered every word, every tear, the weight of her suitcase, the sound of her car door closing, the way she looked at me one last time before driving away. But clearly none of it happened. Finally, I accepted it must have been an incredibly vivid dream, my subconscious acting out what I've been planning to do for weeks. Maybe I was more stressed about it than I realized. That night when Marcia got home around nine PM, I was waiting at the table. We need to talk. She sat down already looking worried. What's wrong? I broke up with her again, explained everything exactly like I had in the dream. She was sad but understanding, started packing her things. I helped carry bags to her car, watched her load the trunk. She was gone by midnight. I texted my friends and family, got supportive responses back, went to bed alone, feeling that same mix of sadness and relief. Tuesday morning, I woke up to her arm draped across my chest. I gasped so loud she jolted awake. What's wrong? Are you okay? Did you have a nightmare? I broke up with you last night, I said. Voice shaking. Why are you still here? Your stuff was gone. She looked completely confused, almost concerned. Leon, you had another dream. We broke up. That's the second time this week. Maybe you should talk to someone about this. I checked my phone. The text were gone again, every single one. She got up to make coffee like nothing happened, humming that song she always hums in the kitchen while I sat there losing my mind. I tried again Wednesday night, packed her bags myself this time. Thursday night, changed the locks after she left. Friday night, watched her drive away and stayed up all night to make sure she didn't come back. Saturday night, I filmed the entire breakup on my phone. Every single morning she's back in bed beside me, phone wiped clean, video gone, locks unchanged. No evidence any of it happened. It's, and nine times now I've broken up with Marcia nine times. And every morning she's still here making pancakes, kissing my head, asking about my day like nothing ever happened. Last night I didn't even try. What's the point? I don't know if I'm losing my mind or if something else is going on, but I physically, literally cannot break up with my girlfriend.

This guy had a whole story ready with dates, specific violations, detailed notes. He sounded incredibly credible and professional. The judge was nodding along, taking notes. Everything felt hopeless. That's when this woman in the back stood up wearing a floral dress and carrying a massive hearse. Excuse me, your honor, but I need to say something. The developer's lawyer spun around looking annoyed. This is a closed hearing. You can't just interrupt. But judge looked curious. Who are you? I'm the county clerk from permits and records. I've worked there for 32 years processing every single building permit in this county. The lawyer tried to object, but the judge waved him off. She pointed right at the developer. This man filed permits for that subdivision using your dad's contractor license number. But here's what's interesting. Three months after your dad finished, he. I filed permits for additional work on those same houses, listed a different contractor, different crew, said it was renovation work. But I pulled the permits from his other projects, too. And he's done this exact same thing before, twice, actually. The courtroom went dead silent. The judge leaned forward. You have proof of this. Walk to the bench and handed him a folder that's permits going back 4 years showing the same pattern with three different contractors. He files the lawsuits right before the license suspension would hit for unpaid Permits uses the lawsuit to claim the contractor abandoned the job while he keeps all the buyer payments and pays nobody. The developer's face went completely white. His lawyer started shuffling papers frantically looking panic. The woman kept going. I didn't connect it until I saw the hearing notice post and recognized his company name. I brought copies of everything. Permits complaints, three separate contractor board investigations that he somehow managed to avoid. The judge spent 5 minutes reading through the documents, his face getting angrier with each page. Then he looked directly at the developer. Criminal fraud charges will be filed today. As for this lawsuit, it's missed with prejudice. He turned to my dad. File a counter suit for your full contract amount plus damages and this court will expedite it. My dad got paid everything he was owed plus another $60,000 for legal fees and damages. The developers facing 10 years. Two other contractors came forward after seeing the news because he'd done the same exact thing to them, but they were too broke to fight it in court.

My dad worked construction for 15 years, building houses across three counties, had his own small crew, just four guys who'd been with him since the beginning. They did good work, never cut corners, always finished on time. Then this developer hired them for a big project, 12 houses in a new subdivision outside Phoenix. This job my dad ever landed worth $240,000. They worked on it for five months straight, sunrise to sunset, weekends included. My dad even took out a loan to buy extra equipment because the developer kept pushing for faster completion, said there were buyers waiting, said he'd pay a bonus if they finished early. So my dad pushed his crew harder than ever. They finished three weeks ahead of schedule. Every house passed inspection, everything up to code, no issues whatsoever. But when my dad submitted the final invoice, the developer went complete be silent. Calls went straight to voicemail, emails bounced back. The office was suddenly closed for renovations. Two weeks passed and a month. My dad had bills piling up, equipment, loan payments, payroll for his crew that he'd already paid from his own savings, figuring the developer's check would cover it. Then the lawsuit arrived. The developer was suing my dad for $180,000, claiming fault, the workmanship, structural defects, code violations, said he had to hire another crew to fix everything, said buyers were backing out because of my dad's shoddy Work. My dad couldn't believe it. The courthouse was packed when we showed up. The developer brought his lawyer, some guy in a 3,000 dollar suit carrying a briefcase that probably cost more than my car. He had a whole presentation ready with photos of cracked foundations, uneven floors, electrical problems. But those photos weren't from my dad's job. They couldn't be because my dad took progress photos every single day and documented everything. His lawyer kept trying to explain this, but the developer's lawyer talked over him louder, more confident, more prepared. He had inspection reports showing violations, statements from three different contractors who claimed they had to redo my dad's work. Invoices showing he'd already paid $95,000 to fix the damn. It looks terrible for us. My dad just sat there looking completely defeated. He'd already lost 20 pounds from stress, wasn't sleeping, could barely function. Mom said he'd wake up at 3 a. M. Just staring at the ceiling. The business he'd spent 15 years building was done. Even if he won, his reputation was destroyed and nobody would hire him after this. The developer.

I'll never forget the way my dad looked at me that night. Cold, like I was nothing. I was standing there holding my toddler's hand with nowhere to go at 9 p m. I'd moved back in two months earlier after losing my job, just temporary, until I could save up for daycare. My mom welcomed me, but Monica, my sister, made it clear I wasn't wanted.

Monica said she found the missing emergency cash in my dresser. Over $10,000. I couldn't even form words. Dad grabbed trash bags and started shoving My things in my son's toys. Dumped like garbage. I told them to check fingerprints, cameras, anything. Monica cut in. She's just trying to buy time to escape with the money. As I stood outside with my son crying, Monica leaned out. Good luck surviving, loser. I had no plan. No car. Maybe $40. I did the one thing I never wanted to do. I called Uncle Dustin. He answered on the second ring. My dad's older brother, the successful one. I told him everything. Come stay with me. He said that night was the beginning of something none of them saw coming. The next morning, Dustin asked what happened. When I finished, he said, I've been waiting for something like this. He told me he'd always had a bad feeling about Monica.

The phone interview goes amazing. Lisa's professional, knowledgeable, and she mentions she's worked with diverse patient populations. My boss can't find a single fault with her answers. He's cornered into offering an in person interview. The day Lisa comes in, I'm nervous as hell. She shows up in a crisp navy suit, resume folder in hand, looking like she belongs in a boardroom. My boss does a double take when he sees her, and I can practically see the wheels turning in his racist little brain. But here's the thing about Lisa. She's Not just qualified, she's exceptional. She walks my boss through her experience saving lives in Afghanistan, her work in inner city emergency rooms, specialized training in geriatric care. By the end of the interview, even he can't deny she's perfect for the job. Still, I know he'll find some excuse not to hire her. So I play dirty. I mentioned to our CEO that we interviewed this incredible candidate with military experience and how it would look great for the company to hire a veteran. Our CEO is a Marine himself, so he asks to meet her. Lisa gets the job.

She was like a one woman distraction campaign. When the minister asked if anyone objected, I swear she looked ready to stand up just for the attention. That's when I remembered what I was carrying, Rachel's emergency bridal kit, lipstick for touch UPS, 50 pins for wardrobe malfunctions remedies and a small bottle of bright red nail polish for any last minute manicure disasters. During the ring exchange, the most important moment of the ceremony, mom started fanning herself dramatically with her program, sighing about how emotional everything was making her. I walked over like the helpful daughter, pretending to offer her a tissue from the emergency kit. As I fumbled with the zipper, I accidentally squeeze a nail polish bottle too hard. The cat hopped off and bright red polish splashed across the front of her pristine white dress. Crimson streaks ran down the bodice like she'd been attacked by an angry artist. Oh my god, I gasped loudly enough for the entire congregation to hear. Mom, I'm so sorry. I'm such a klutz. She couldn't scream during Daniel and Rachel's vows without ruining the moment for everyone. She couldn't storm out without admitting the dress was inappropriate. She just stood there frozen while red nail polish dripped down on her champagne gown as 150 Guests watched in fascination. The wedding photographer, bless him, kept snapping away. Every single photo from that moment forward shows Rachel glowing in her elegant ivory gown, Daniel beaming with joy, and mom in the background looking like she lost a fight with a paint balloon. The reception photos are even better. Mom spent the entire party trying to hide the red stains with her clutch, but you can still see the damage in every shot. She still insists the dress was champagne, not white. It was a completely different shade from the brides, she tells anyone who will listen. But now it's definitely red. And Rachel, she sent me the most beautiful thank you card afterward with just two words, perfect aim.

Five years later, she was the caterer at my millionaire event. It happened mid toast. I was holding a glass of champagne, ready to say something kind about her turning 32 when her hand cracked across my face hard, the kind that echoes. Her sister laughed first, then her college roommate. Her mom stared at her plate like she didn't see it. No one said a word. I remember just standing there, face burning, wondering if anyone would speak up. They didn't. So I set my glass down, grabbed my keys from the by the door and left. Didn't pack a bag, didn't argue, just drove. Later, I found out the truth. That slap wasn't anger. It was strategy. She'd been planning it for months. She wanted witnesses to say I abandoned her so she could keep the house, the and even the dog, make me look like the monster so she could play the victim. Two days later, the divorce papers arrived. Her lawyer claimed she hit me in self defense. Twelve witnesses backed her story. I had no messages saved, no proof, just humiliation. I signed the papers from a cheap motel in Ohio. The carpet smelled like smoke and mold. I had three four hundred dollars to my name and a truck that rattled above 50. The first night I lay on the bed staring at the sea, feeling fan, thinking maybe this was rock Bottom. But something in me refused to stay there. The first year was brutal. I worked construction by day and taught myself coding at night, sitting in the library parking lot, stealing Wi-Fi from my phone. Some nights, I'd park outside a diner just to warm up, watching strangers laugh over meals I couldn't afford. I wore the same three shirts until the seams gave out. Dinner was ramen or gas station sandwiches. That winter, the heat barely worked. I slept beside my toolbox and two jackets. Every time I wanted to quit, I pictured that dinner table, her smirk, her sister's laugh, the silence. That silence became my motivation. Year 2, I landed a junior job at a small tech startup. It paid next to nothing, but it felt like a door cracking open. Year 3, the company folded. Instead of quitting, I bought their client list for pennies and started consulting on my own. I lived on coffee, deadlines and sheer panic. Year 4, I sold.

Jesus! Hey! No! He offered to grant the man any wish. I wish I had all the time in the world to finish animating this shot. The genie used his power to steal all the world's time, condensing it into a purple button. Even earth stopped spinning. Press the button to pause time. Press again to resume.

Then he pressed the button to help the homeless man perform a difficult move, forcing passers by to applaud. Finally, he put all the money into the homeless man's hat. He took the money to the supermarket. There, he suddenly spotted a man and a woman. He wanted to create a scene of love at first sight, so he repeatedly froze time. Eventually, he even ripped out the man's heart instead of pressing the button. He rushed the man to the hospital, but the doctors were frozen too, so he had to teach Himself medicine to perform the surgery. After years of study, he began operating. He stitched the man back together, then restarted time. Oh thank god! He brought the man back to the supermarket. After time resumed, the people in the control room were shocked. The man returned to his company filled with regret. He decided to confess everything to everyone. He turned his experiences into a video and played it on the screen. But then time froze again. The button also stopped working. Then the genie warned him that pausing time requires a price. He will be trapped forever in the paused world with no escape. Finally, the genie destroyed the button and departed.

When she picked the phone back up and looked at the screen, she was horrified to find that all the photos had automatically been sent to her boyfriend. Panicked, she jumped on her bike and raced towards school. On the way, she hit a rock, which made the bike go out of control and speed down the road. Luckily, her tire didn't blow until a cat suddenly ran out and punctured it. Just as she was freaking out, she saw her grandma driving by, so she hopped in the car, but it was moving slower than a snail, so she grabbed the wheel and took off down the highway. In just two and a half seconds, she made it to school. At that moment, the boy was about to check his messages and the girl was sweating bullets. Fortunately, the boy had to get to class, so he put his phone in his locker. The girl rushed into the locker room and quickly styled her hair to look like his, easily fooling the locker's facial recognition. But the phone slipped and fell again, right into the hands of The boy who had just come back. Just as he was about to check it, a kitten suddenly darted in, snatched the phone, and deleted all the photos. The girl finally breathed a sigh of relief, grateful that her boyfriend never saw the pictures.

There's literally nowhere where you can get this many socks that are actually a good quality for this price. Because of that, though, these are always out of stock.

We can't even decorate our homes without being criticized. Listen, we've come a long way. We used to decorate with empty liquor bottles and Christmas lights on top of our kitchen cabinets, with a crusty pleather couch that some family member was giving away for free. We grew up in houses that looked like the inside of a Cracker Barrel. And if you were rich, the inside of an Olive Garden, fake grapes and little tiny fat chefs. And if you were really rich, the inside of your house looked like a Cheesecake Factory. I'm talking faux columns, baby. The amount of clutter we grew up with in our childhood homes made us wanna be sterile, made us gravitate to plain millennial gray. My parents saved every paper utility Bill they've ever received, every Bill. My whole life is on auto pay. We don't want clutter. Our brains are already cluttered enough. So if we want our houses to look clean and sterile and boring, let us.

I've had three meetings with your department heads. You weren't in any of them. Brad was pale. I didn't mention it because you treated everything I did like a joke. You own a tech company, mom said.

Mom's note, family is everything. I called a friend in cyber security. Two days later. He said to file. Brad had job hopped constantly, bad investments. More importantly, he'd been running a crypto scheme promising returns that never came. My sister was marrying a con man. IRS, VPED. Yes. Wedding day came. Short ceremony, then reception. I waited. Just as dessert was served, I stood. May I say a few words? Brad smiled tightly. I'm happy for bell. You look beautiful. She blinked. Brad, I wasn't sure about you, but I've done some homework. Dug into your background, your investments. Brad stiffened. I'm just here to tell the truth. I pulled out my phone, connected it to the projector. A PDF appeared. Investor communication records, credence coin 2021 to 2023. Then screenshots, then a recorded zoom pitch where Brad promised guaranteed returns. Gasps. Brad's been running a Ponzi scheme for two years, I said calmly. Dad went white. Belle stood clutching her bouquet. Roy, what is this? What I tried to tell you, he's not who he says he is. Brad moved toward me. I've already submitted this to the SEC. This, it's just a courtesy. His face drained. No one in this family wanted to believe I could be right. I was told to stop making the family look bad. I looked at mom. Her hands trembled. But today I chose truth. Belle, you deserve better. I walked out. Brad was detained. Belle annulled the marriage in under a month. My parents went silent. A blank card arrived. I tossed it. Some doors closed themselves.

Her dog sat nearby, tilting its head in confusion. Just as Amy was wrapped up in her daydreams, front door suddenly opened. Her mom had returned unexpectedly, catching Amy off guard. Amy quickly adjusted her clothes and rushed to her desk, pretending to be deeply focused on studying. The moment her mom stepped inside, she immediately sensed something was off. She asked why the phone was lying on the floor. Amy nervously explained that the dog had knocked it over, then quickly grabbed the leash and took the dog outside. While out walking, she unexpectedly ran into Aaron, the guy she'd secretly had a crush on for ages. Even though it was just a casual encounter, Amy couldn't help but see it as a special, almost magical moment. But then Aaron suddenly said he had to go. He casually mentioned that he'd be having a birthday party next and invited Amy to come hang out before the big night. When the party day arrived, Amy carefully dressed up, determined to look her best. Second Aaron saw her, he was completely captivated. Later, they stepped outside together, their eyes meeting in a shy, lingering gaze. Both overjoyed, Amy rushed tell her best friend about what had happened, only to be shocked when Aaron later denied everything in front of everyone. Humiliated and heartbroken, from that day on, gossip spread like Wildfire through the school and classmates started get.

What rumor? I looked up confused and reached for my phone but remembered it had died on the bus that morning. The entire classroom went silent. Kids who were talking suddenly stopped mid sentence. Everyone was stealing glances at me, but whenever I made eye contact, they'd quickly look away. This one girl, Arlene, in the front row, was actually crying while looking at me. But for some reason the boys were laughing. Miss I O Connor shifted uncomfortably and adjusted her glasses. I'm not at liberty to discuss the rumor with you. I really suggest you speak with the counselor. My heart started racing because something was seriously wrong. Whatever this rumor was, it had made my teacher look at me like I was made of glass about to break. I grabbed my dead phone and my backpack and headed for the door. I needed to find my best friend, Kaylee right now. Kaylee was in Mister Brady's home room down the hall. I knocked and pointed at her through the little window. Mister Brady looked at me with the same wide eyed sad expression Miss O'connor had and immediately let Kaylee come out. That's when I knew this was bad. Teachers never just let kids leave class without a hall pass. The second we got into the hallway, Kaylee grabbed me in the tightest hug. I'm so sorry this is happening to you. Baby, I'm so, so sorry. I started crying without even knowing why. My best friend was holding me like my life was ruined. All I could think about was if someone leaked me. Kaylee just kept hugging me and rubbing my back while I sob.

I looked at my food, I looked at her, and I just said it honestly. No, not this time. I only got enough for me. Her whole face changed. She looked at me like I just told her I ran over her dog. What? I said I only ordered enough for myself. You said you weren't hungry. She sat there for a second, just staring at me. Then she goes, wow, okay. Didn't know you were so stingy about a few fries. It's not about being stingy. You always say you're not hungry and then eat half my food. She stood up and her voice got all high pitched. I don't always do that. Yes, you do. Last week you ate four of my tacos. Those were supposed to be four tacos for me. You ate one and a half of them. Lisa crossed her arms and said I was being dramatic, that it was just food and friends share. But I asked you before I ordered. You said no. She didn't have anything to say to that. So instead she just went, fine, whatever, and walked to her room. Then she slammed the door so hard, our apartment shook. I sat there eating my nuggets in this awkward silence. I could hear her moving stuff around in her room all aggressively, slamming drawers, throwing things. The next morning, she completely ignored me. Walked right past me in the kitchen without saying anything. I Tried to say good morning, and she just grabbed her coffee and left her work. This went on for three days. She'd come home and go straight to her room. If I was in the living room, she'd turn around and leave. Our mutual friend Amanda texted me asking what happened between us. Apparently, Lisa had been complaining to her about how I refused to share my food. Amanda said I could have just given her a few fries to keep the peace, that it wasn't worth fighting over. But that's exactly the problem. I asked Lisa before I ordered. She said she wasn't hungry. Why is it my fault for believing her? If she wanted food, she should have said yes when I asked. Now I'm apparently the bad guy for setting one tiny boundary. Lisa still barely talks to me and makes these huge sighs whenever I'm in the same room. All over some McDonald's fries.

My roommate Lisa and I get along great most of the time. We watch shows together, split cleaning duties. The whole thing works pretty well. But there's this one thing she does that drives me absolutely insane. Every single time I order food, she says she's not hungry. I'll ask her if she wants anything when I'm about to place my order. She always goes, nah, I'm good. I'll just make something later. Cool, perfect. So I order enough food for just me. Then my food shows up and suddenly she transforms into this hovering vulture. She'll come out of her room and be like, oh my god, that smells amazing. Can I just have a few fries? Except a few fries means she takes like half a and somehow my chicken nuggets mysteriously disappear. One time I ordered a burger and she asked for one bite. One bite turned into half my burger being gone. The worst part is she acts like she's doing me a favor by helping me finish my food. Like I ordered too much and she's just being helpful. But I didn't order too much. I ordered exactly what I wanted to eat. So last Thursday night, I was starving after work. I ordered McDonald's large fries, 10 piece nuggets and three containers of sweet and sour sauce because I'm not a monster. Before I ordered I asked Lisa if she wanted anything. She was on her phone and just waved her hand at me. Nope, I'm not hungry at all. Might make some pasta later. Okay, perfect. I placed my order just for me. 20 minutes later, my food arrives and I'm sitting on the couch ready to watch this show I've been waiting for. I open up my bag and start eating. This smell of those fries hits different when you're really hungry. Not even two minutes go by before Lisa comes out of her room. She stops in the doorway and goes, uh, that smells so good. I can already see where this is going. She walks over and sits down next to me on the couch. Can I just have a few fries?

The ropes binding them tightened rapidly, dragging them into the sea. The immense pull of the yacht quickly brought them to the surface and the man tried to break free, but the cunning robber noticed and immediately increased the yacht speed. Worse still, the area was surrounded by sharp coral reefs. In an effort to protect the woman, the man deliberately rolled over, using his back to shield himself from the coral. His back was instantly slashed by the coral and the blood quickly attracted sharks. Seeing the sharks approach, the man twisted his body desperately trying to avoid their attacks. At that moment, the robbers also spotted the sharks in the water. With a twisted grin, the robber ordered his crew to steer the yacht back into the shark infested waters, intending to use the two of them as bait. Suddenly the man noticed the rope was loosening. He knew this was his chance to escape. As the yacht turned, they went back underwater and tied the rope to a rock. Once the yacht completed its turn, the robbers immediately accelerated, believing they had hooked a shark. The man gripped the rope tightly, desperately trying to keep it from slipping off the rocks. The robbers, thinking they had caught a shark, fed up even more. Finally, after the man's relentless efforts, rope snapped under the weight of the yacht in That moment a boy sprang out of nowhere, throwing one of the robbers into the sea. The sharks quickly spotted the robber, surfaced, and began devouring him.

Kelly grabbed the letter. Full scholarship, that's impossible. She's not even honor society. I was rejected from honor society by Mr Brenner. He was the faculty advisor. Said my grades weren't good enough. The grades he'd been tanking. This has to be a mistake. Mr Brenner said, I'll call Cornel myself. Please do ask for Doctor Williams. She interviewed me. You went behind the school's back for interviews. You refused to write my recommendation letter, said it would be a waste of your time cause you're not MIT material. Neither is Kelly. But you wrote her three recommendations. How dare you compare yourself to my daughter, your daughter who cheated on the sat s. Everyone knows she sat next to Tommy Chen and copied his answers. Mr Brenner stood up. Get out of my class. Gladly. I'm done learning from someone who sabotages students. I went to the principal with everything. My graded papers from before and after Kelly lost. The Science Olympiad, the recommendation letter, reduction, schedule change, the mail incident that happened in front of witnesses. The principal called a meeting. Mr Brenner brought Kelly. This is a misunderstanding, he insisted. I've always supported all my students and explained the grade drop. She got lazy. Here's my work. You tell me what's lazy. The principal reviewed everything. Mr Brenner, these grades don't match the quality of work. Sometimes I grade hard to push students. Only her after your daughter lost to her. That's a coincidence. The mail. Incident. I explained that it was junk mail from Cornell with her name on it that you threw away in front of the class. The principal turned to me. What would you like to see happen? I want my grades fixed, my real grades done. Want an apology to the class? He humiliated me in front of Mr Brenner. He mumbled something. And I want Kelly investigated for sat cheating. Kelly screamed, you bitter bitch. Mr Brenner went purple. We're leaving. This is harassment. Principal stood up. Mr Brenner, you're on administrative leave pending investigation. By graduation, Mr Brenner was teaching freshman health. Kelly's sat scores were invalidated. She ended up at community college, actually at Riverside. I gave the valedictorian speech at Cornell orientation, mentioned a teacher who taught me that respect is earned through actions, not titles. Didn't name him. Didn't need to. Everyone from our school knew exactly who I meant.

Some kids aren't meant for college. The letter was from Cornell. Full ride for engineering. He didn't know that part. Just saw my name and tossed it. The whole class saw. Nobody said anything. They never did when Mister Brenner decided someone wasn't worth his time. He'd been my physics teacher for two years to tell everyone I was his best student. That changed when his daughter Kelly didn't get into regionals for Science Olympiad and I did. Must be quotas, he'd said. Then they need diversity. I'm white, just poor. That's when the grades started dropping. Perfect lab work became BS. Tests with all correct answers got marked down for sloppy handwriting. My handwriting hadn't changed. His grading had. You need to be realistic about your abilities, he'd tell me during parent conferences. Trade schools are perfectly respectable. My mom worked three jobs to pay for my AP tests. Mr. Brenner knew that, made sure to mention the test fees whenever she came in. Some families prioritize differently, he'd say. The Cornell letter arrived at school because our mailbox got smashed and mail kept getting stolen. I'd use the school address for all my college applications. Mr. Brenner volunteered to distribute mail to students. I'll make sure everyone gets their important correspondence, he'd promised the principal. That morning, he walked in holding a stack of envelopes. College responses are arriving, he announced. Let's see who got good news. He opened Kelly's first MIT waitlist. Excellent. Waitlist at MIT is basically acceptance. It wasn't. Then he got to mine. Didn't even look at the return address. Just saw my name. Oh, Riverside Community College. How nice. Tossed it straight into the garbage. Some of us have realistic expectations. I stood up. That's from Cornel. Sure it is. He laughed. Kelly laughed. Half the class laughed. I walked to the trash and pulled it out. The Cornel crest was right there on the envelope. His face changed. Well, let's not make assumptions. Could be a rejection. Open it, then read it to the class like you did with Kelly's. That's private. You just threw my private mail in the garbage. I thought it was junk mail from Cornel with my name on it. Mistakes happen. Sit down. Read the letter, or I'm going to the principal. Are you threatening me? I'm stating facts. You opened Kelly's mail without permission. Open mine. He tore it open roughly, probably hoping to rip the letter. Started reading silently. His face went red, then white. What does it say? Kelly asked. Congratulations. He muttered. For what

It wasn't the first time. Every episode of violence was followed by the same act, his trembling apologies, his soft, deceitful promises. Once Anna had been a brilliant attorney, sharp and confident. But for the sake of her family, she had surrendered that world and traded her courtroom victories for kitchen silence. What she received in return was not love, but a cycle of bruises and fear. One morning, after walking her son to school, Anna Learned he had been tormenting other students. Her heart cracked. She saw his father's cruelty growing inside him. Terrified of history repeating itself, she decided to run. Secretly, she rented a small place outside of town, praying for freedom. But her husband found out he always did. That evening, the town glimmered under the lights of a masquerade ball. Anna sat in the passenger seat, every muscle tense, waiting for the storm to begin. She feared the moment he'd pull over, the violence that would follow. But when they reached the venue, he didn't stop. He kept driving, past the music, past the lights, until the car vanished into the dark outskirts. And this time, he didn't raise his hand.

And you can bet your ass that when a police officer, a racist police officer, has his pistol pointed in the face of someone of color, they are not differentiating between Jamaican, Haitian, Liberian, African, or African American. They see we are all a part of the same pigmentation gang, so let's knock that corny shit off. That's why I thought it was funny even during the debates when the moderator called Trump out for saying she wasn't black.

And in that moment, everything clicked. The man he'd been watching for years had been watching him, too. Jack was an intelligence officer assigned to keep tabs on a writer named Tom. His superiors had said it was just another routine mission. But as he listened to their private conversations, doubt began to creep in. In the exchanges between Tom and his girlfriend, Emma, a strange code kept appearing, one that, to Jack's horror, Atched his own identification number. First, he thought it was coincidence. Then came the punch line. It was a joke. Tom already knew he was being monitored. That changed everything. Jack decided to turn the game around. He dug into Tom's past, and what he found made his blood run cold. Tom had once worked for the same agency, now masquerading as a novelist, setting traps for hidden operatives, testing who could truly be trusted. Emma, she wasn't innocent either. Her gestures, her glances looked choreographed, like she was performing for an unseen lens. She knew Jack was there. As Jack dove deeper into classified archives, the final piece fell into place. Tom's real assignment was to expose agents who were ready to betray their own. Camera fades to black. The sound of static fills the air. The hunter has become the hunted.
