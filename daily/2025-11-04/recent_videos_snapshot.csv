Now, I hate to interrupt your little manufactured family gathering, but this is a robbery. Everyone stay calm and you won't get hurt. Just put all your belongings in the bag. What are you gonna do? Stay calm. Do as they say. We don't wanna make the situation worse. Come on, cough it up, ladies. Yeah! That's beautiful. Thank you. Give me the pearls, please. My late husband gave me. I don't care. Put it in the bag before I rip it off your neck. Patrice, we'll get it back, okay? You know, you really shouldn't lie to your eldest. I'm not lying when I tell her that. But when I tell you you're under arrest. You know, I love the confidence, but, uh, we're the only ones with guns here. Oh, I don't mean now, but soon enough, I'll be putting a different kind of bracelet on you. Thank you. I'll take that. Yeah, baby. Thanks, everybody. We love you. Hey. You okay? Yeah. Did Wesley find you? He's been frantic. I know. Patrice and I had to scrape him off the ceiling. I sent him and Jack away so I could go to work. Did you get an idea on the sticker team? Yep. Jonah Cahill. Monica DeMar. That's our valet. He beat up a guest this morning and stole a Porsche. Oh, and that's the woman that Nolan and gray put out a BOLO for. She pitched a fit at one Of the stars on Hot Suspect and then quit. Which suggests the robbery was a spur of the moment thing. Yeah, they might have snapped after a bad morning at work and decided that crime paid better. I'm assuming they have criminal records. Yeah, minor offences stretching back into their teens. They're both living at a Halfway House in Korea Town. I got uniforms parked outside in case they come back. They stole your Mother's Day present. I'm going to get it back. Damn right you are. And I am gonna help you. Nobody messes with Mother's Day and gets away with it. Donovan took Lila out of town. What? Uh huh. I knew he was an ass, but I didn't think he was evil. My abuela taught me the perfect curse to put on him. Ooh, does it involve boils? No, but parts of him will definitely fall off. Ooh. Okay. We should leave before it becomes accessories. Those rappers don't stand a chance. Any luck? No. I called half the phones they stole, including mine. Straight to voicemail. I've got plain clothes officer stationed at all the pawn shops this side of the 4:05. If they show up, we will be waiting. Tell them I wanna be the one who puts on the cuffs. I made a promise. I love it so much. New phone. Who this? Detective Lopez we met this morning. The cop from the restaurant. What's up, detective? You are calling to arrest us? Cause I Don't think you can do that over the phone. No, I'm calling to tell you to turn yourselves in. You committed armed robbery. Half the LAPD is looking for you. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. See, we got this whole crime spree planned out. Isn't that right, baby? That's right. Listen, I know you two have gone through a lot. Please. You think reading a file gives you any idea who we are? You are a terrible cop. Trust me, I've read enough files to understand that. You and Jonah never caught a single break. Yet when you got out of prison, you try to go straight. Even got yourselves real jobs. Yeah, you know what? You were still treated like scum. Not even worth an ounce of respect. Angela, they are live streaming your conversation. You can save the false empathy, detective. Today is for every worker who's ever been mistreated, for anyone who's ever wanted to walk off the job. If anybody that believed the lie that if you just tried to work harder, you could achieve your dreams. We are done begging for scraps. Today, we are taking what's ours. Let's take it all, baby. We are taking it. Let's take it all! I love you. I love you.

The prices were 10 times higher than regular fried chicken places, yet the restaurant was packed with customers and there was even a long line forming outside. A few days earlier, because they had boxed several cases, their superior said he was going to disband their squad. One day, the chief of the Major Crimes unit came to see them saying there was a major drug lord who had just been released from prison. He would definitely continue his criminal activities after getting out. So they immediately began surveillance. They discovered the drug dealer was living in a residential building. To find evidence of criminal activity, they monitored him from a fried chicken shop across the street for a whole week, but there were no leads whatsoever. The fried chicken shop owner mentioned that people in the building across the street would order delivery. The captain got really excited because they could disguise themselves as delivery drivers and sneak in to install listening devices. But the owner told them the fried chicken shop was closing down. Everyone felt defeated. That's when a team member suggested buying the place. This way they could gather evidence more effectively. So the captain withdrew his retirement fund early and bought the fried chicken shop. They then started taking turns monitoring the drug dealer. But within just a few days, the previously empty fried chicken shop suddenly had customers showing up. Regularly, often leaving them completely flustered. To avoid arousing suspicion, they decided to operate the business normally. But none of them knew how to make fried chicken. So they decided each person would make fried chicken once, according to the recipe, and whoever made the best tasting one would become the head chef. Soon, several batches of fried chicken were ready. The first few batches tasted terrible, until this one plate of fried chicken appeared, golden and crispy on the outside with tender, juicy meat inside. Jim was appointed as the head chef. Before long, a customer came in, but the customer ordered sauced fried chicken. They only had the recipe for original fried chicken. Jim could only give it a try. Based on the sauce he normally used for making ribs, he created a sauced fried chicken dish. The customer looked at the fried chicken in front of them with confusion. The captain said it was the restaurant's new specialty. The customer tentatively took a bite and their eyes instantly lit up, praising the taste enthusiastically. Everyone was thrilled. As more and more customers came, word of mouth spread faster and faster. Within just a few days, the entire fried chicken shop was packed and there was even a long line outside. Although they made a lot of money, they weren't happy because they needed to collect evidence of the drug dealer's crimes. To reduce customer traffic, they raised the price of fried chicken by a full 10 times. Unexpectedly, even more customers showed up.

The girl didn't mind, but this scene hurt the girl's brother. After returning home, he vowed to make his sister a lunch that everyone would envy. Ever since Jack's parents passed away, he had been living with his aunt. This day, there was a stranger in the house who had also prepared breakfast. Toast, fried eggs and a glass of milk. Jack suddenly remembered. The girl in front of him was his aunt's daughter. A few days ago, his aunt had unexpectedly passed away. She was a single mother with only one daughter by her side. She entrusted her daughter to Jack's care. The two initially had a rather distant relationship. Jack tried to break the silence, but his sister remained silent. However, upon seeing the sauteed burdock root, she suddenly burst into tears. People thought Jack was a human trafficker. Their first meeting didn't go smoothly. Jack thought his sister disliked him. Unexpectedly, the next day, his sister got up early and made breakfast and also prepared a lunch. Jack felt very surprised. At lunchtime, he eagerly opened it, only to find just sauteed burdock root. Upon returning home in the evening, he saw his sister making lunch boxes. He gently said there was no need to specially prepare lunches. His sister said her newly transferred school didn't provide lunch To save money, when she prepared lunch for herself, she also prepared one for him. Jack looked through the enrollment notice and indeed it stated that lunch wasn't provided. Moreover, his sister kept wearing her school uniform because she had no change of clothes. He realized he had cared too little for his sister. So he took initiative to be responsible for tomorrow's lunch. Jack planned to make hamburger patties. That was his aunt's favorite dish. His sister would definitely like it too. Jack started getting busy in the kitchen. First, he chopped onions and sauteed them in the pan. After bringing out the aroma, he mixed them with the ground meat and pan fried them. When both sides were golden brown, the hamburger patties were done. After tasting, Jack felt the flavor wasn't right. Recalling all the details of his aunt's cooking, he realized he had forgotten to add miso. He made them again. This time it was finally right. Jack handed the lunch box to his sister, saying it had the taste of home. His sister accepted it with some doubt. At lunchtime, the girl opened her lunch box. Inside were neatly arranged meat patties. The girl tentatively took a bite, and indeed, it tasted like her mother's cooking. In the evening, Jack saw the empty lunch box. He was very happy. The brother decided to continue making lunch boxes for his sister.

The man quickly handed a wooden box to the woman, telling her to jam the car's accelerator with it.

After they finished cleaning and were about to relax, the man realized there wasn't even a bathtub in the house. So he hired a carpenter to custom make an extra large bathtub, one big enough to fit plenty of people without any issue. However, the bathtub would take some time to complete. In the meantime, the man explored dungeons to earn gold coins. They collected a large amount of rabbit fur, which the girl used to prepare meals from the rabbit meat. While the man sold the fur at a cloth shop for money, there he spotted some silk pajamas and asked the shop assistant about the price. Although they were quite expensive, he still bought two sets for the girl. When they returned home, the custom bathtub had arrived. As the girl asked which pajamas she should wear, the man insisted on taking a bath with her first. He quickly filled the bathtub with water and tried to heat it using gold coins, but he didn't have enough coins, so the water heated very slowly. To earn more, he ventured back into the dungeon. This time, however, he encountered a powerful monster and was injured during the fight. By the time he returned, the bath water was fully ready. Seeing the man wounded, the girl felt deeply distressed and offered to heal his injuries. Thanks to her, Miraculous healing. The man quickly regained his vitality.

Yet reaching the spot for harvest, they found all ice already grabbed. Thus, they headed back bare. Meanwhile, broadcasts detailed warming racks. Even tortoises began trekking. Bender caught it all and sank in sorrow. He journeyed far to aid a tortoise. Folks baffled why Bender rescued this tortoise. Bender clarified. Seeing the tortoise stuck upside, he recalled himself. Since when Bender flops, he can't write himself too. Hearing this all urged Bender to flop shortly to tackle warming, officials rallied top brains worldwide, staged a huge forum seeking fix for warming mess. One pro proposed huge space reflector, bouncing sun rays to cut solar heat hitting earth. Sounded solid. Yet when junk hit the reflector, it spun, pointing straight at earth. Sun rays bundled by reflector began blasting earth like beam gun. Crowds bolted every way, running for dear life. Then the prof admitted warming was his blame. He'd built bots in youth. Their exhaust rules awful. Other bot traits flawless. Bosses thrilled with outcome kicked off mass output. Bot fumes sparked the warming.

Then I acted like nothing happened and walked out in front of everyone, making sure she didn't notice. I pretended I needed help and called and out of the room on purpose, leaving my brother and wife alone outside. Once we were in the room, she asked what I needed, but I didn't answer. Instead, I picked up a lamp and pretended to get ready for what was coming next. After five minutes, I came out with Anne. She still had no idea. Then, when my brother raised his glass to wish me a happy birthday, I noticed paint on his hand. How long. How long have you been doing this? My brother kept pretending not to hear anything. I couldn't take it anymore, so I grabbed the lamp and walked over to him. I angrily asked about the paint on his hand. He said he must have brushed against it outside by accident. Seeing him keep making excuses, I down my drink in one go, getting ready to expose all their secrets.

In a flash, Stan grew new legs, but the legs were very tiny. That day, Roger pushed Stan into the pool. A polar bear grabbed Stan and held him under. Luckily, the staff tranquilized the bear just in time. But the bear had already bitten off Stan's legs. I'll take you to the hospital. No, I need to save him. Roger secretly carried Stan away. By now, Stan was unconscious. Roger had to use a stick to move Stan's hands. Stan's CIA status got them into Area 51. The medicine to save Stan was here. Roger reached a room and found a box. After looking around, he finally found the lost fanny pack. He removed the bandages and put the ointment on his hand. Then he applied it to Stan's wound. I think it'll be fine. Don't worry. They'll grow back to full size. But if it'll take a few hours. So you'll need to deal with the tiny legs for a bit. Just as they were about to leave, people in Area 51 noticed them. Roger lied, saying he'd accidentally gotten lost. No, you're an alien. That's your picture. Stan's tiny legs made him move slowly and he wasn't used to them yet. Just as they thought it was safe, a grenade was thrown in front of Roger. Thankfully, Stan reacted fast enough. He pulled Roger out and they managed to escape. Stan's had his share of bad luck, like this. Time, for example, someone punched him in the jaw and it shattered completely. Now Stan can only drink liquids through a straw. This left him feeling completely hopeless. One day, he walked into a sandwich shop, ank the sandwich poster right off the wall. Stan demanded that sandwich. In under 3 minutes, it was ready. Stan opened his mouth with all his strength, only for his entire facial brace to come loose.

Yeah, of course. Donald J. Trump is the richest US president. How much is he worth? $4 billion, about $3.7 billion. Pretty good guess by Zack there.

Me llevaron rápidamente a urgencias, pero mi corazón había dejado de latir. Una enfermera cubrió mi cuerpo con una sábana blanca justo cuando se dio la vuelta. Recuperé la conciencia de repente y con una mano me volví a colocar el tabique nasal rojo. Después de salir del hospital, caminé hasta la orilla del río, pero esto me llevó a un encuentro con un vagabundo que pasaba por allí. Me robó los zapatos y me dejó los suyos, viejos y raídos. Continúa con tu intercambio. Poco después, dos niños me encontraron. Al ver que aún respiraba, corrieron débilmente a buscar a su madre. La familia que me salvó apenas tenía recursos escondidos. En un contenedor abandonado. Cocinaron una olla de arroz. La mujer me alimentó con cuidado mientras los niños me veían tragar con avidez. Su mera existencia era una dificultad, pero aún así decidió quedarse conmigo hasta que recuperara la salud bajo El cuidado de la mujer me recuperé poco a poco, aunque lo peor de todo era que había perdido toda la memoria. No me quedaba nada de mi pasado, ni siquiera mi propio nombre. Al día siguiente, mientras jugaba a las cartas con los niños. El padre regresó del trabajo. Los niños le ayudaron a bañarse. Vertieron agua caliente desde el techo, él se bañó debajo, se puso un traje limpio y me invitó a salir a comer. Pronto. Hicimos cola para recibir raciones, un evento benéfico de ayuda comunitaria. Era la primera vez que me mostraba en público mientras todos comían, una mujer se fijó en mí. Finalmente, el hombre quiso tomar una copa. Acababa de recibir su salario. Fuimos al pub y pedimos dos cervezas. El hombre se fijó en el callo de mi mano y dedujo que debía de ser un trabajador manual, pero yo no recordaba nada. De camino a casa, ese hombre cogió un palo a escondidas, pensando que si me golpeaban de nuevo, quizás mi memoria volvería para ayudarme. También hablé con el comisario, pero no pude darle ninguna pista, así que el agente no pudo hacer nada. Me alquiló un contenedor de $100 a la semana, advirtiéndome que si no pagaba a tiempo tendría que irme. Limpié el lugar y llamé a un electricista para que restableciera la electricidad. Ese hombre me trajo algunos muebles viejos. Esa noche, los tres nos sentamos juntos a compartir la comida más sencilla. Durante el día planté Patatas junto a la entrada, pero cuando terminé el cielo se abrió y empezó a llover. Fui a ver a esa mujer otra vez, me dio una dirección, sentí que la esperanza se reavivaba en mi interior, así que decidí buscar trabajo

Hey, up against the wall! What's the problem? Up against the wall! Okay, take it easy. Alright. Against the wall! Spread your legs. Spread them! I tried to explain, but they told me to shut up. After checking me, they found my badge. Turns out I was a cop too. I turned around and glared at them angrily. But the white cop still looked down on me. Must be new. Have a nice day. Watching their patrol car drive away, I was furious inside. I couldn't believe that after five years, racism here was still this bad. Later, I went back to the station, put on my vest, turned on my body cam, and went on patrol with John. That's when a young black guy caught my attention. His eyes were full of hostility. I was confused. Then John explained. This used to be a crowded neighborhood, but now no one manages it anymore. Even if black folks call the cops, we never show up. Then we went into a store. John grabbed some coffee and bread and walked out without paying. I looked at the scared owner, feeling awkward. How much do we owe? Don't worry about it. Ah, that's alright. Cops don't pay you good. I understood what he meant. He was too afraid to take money from cops. So I stuffed the cash into the jar and walked away.

Jack sensed something was wrong. Hey, man, i'mma pop you right here. When Jack searched him and found a gun, I instantly realized what was happening. He was planning to shoot me. Afterward, I apologized to Jack. Sorry. Sorry to get your ass killed out here. Here's a question. You think you're black? Think them your people? Well, they're not. We are. You're blue now. The next day, Jack said he was going to meet an informant. I wanted to go with him, but he told me to stay in the I car. So I sat there staring out the window. Then I saw a black guy sneaking toward the car ahead. I got out and yelled at him. He turned and ran. Immediately, I turned on my body cam and started chasing. Then I heard a gunshot. I thought Jack was in trouble, so I ran straight toward the warehouse. Once inside, I heard voices. I quietly followed the sound. Then I saw two bodies lying on the floor. Jack and two narcotics cops were arguing with a black man. I tried To get closer to listen. But suddenly, one of the narcotics cops opened fire. That's right, zero. I got rid of everybody that can talk. What the hell are you doing here? I thought I told you to stay in the car. What are you doing here? Whoa, whoa, whoa. This isn't what it looks like. Just relax. Where are you going? Put the gun down. He's a bad guy. This is not what it seems. Just relax.

He drilled away all the foam, then grabbed a chair. Blocked Bluto as he tried to escape. Popeye's eyes glinted with determination. He carefully positioned his tools and started trimming Bluto's hair strand by Strand. Bluto tried to squirm away, but Popeye was too quick. Each snip was precise.

Now, he waited for a loud moment in the play, then he pulled the trigger. After firing the shot, he jumped down to the stage, breaking his leg as he landed. Despite the injury, he managed to escape the theater on horseback as a massive manhunt began. He hid for 12 days before being found and killed in a barn. A bullet flew through his right eye, lodging into his skull, and a second bullet hit him right in the chest. It should have been a fatal injury, but somehow he didn't die. That's because he kept a small Bible in his coat pocket, and this stopped the musket ball from piercing his heart. Surgeons removed the bullet from his skull and he lost his right eye. But the Bible saved his life, and he kept it as a reminder. If you lose one of your adult teeth, the bone where the tooth once was can start to deteriorate. To prevent further damage, a dentist will fill the cavity with a synthetic material that mimics real bone. Once filled, a metal bracket is secured on top and the incision is closed.

But it was the biggest mistake of his life. Because when the driver stepped out to confront him, he sprayed even more pepper spray. Then when the man went to his truck and pulled out a stick, he panicked and jumped back into his car to escape. What he didn't realize was that dozens of people had already filmed everything and passed his license plate to the police. Within 20 minutes, he was caught and sent to prison for a year with a 20 thousand dollar fine. Here's. I'm stopping you as you're doing 103 miles an hour and posted 45 mile an hour zone. Do you have your driver's license, registration proof, insurance? Yes. I apologize, sir, I'm on the. I'm doing a test drive right now for the customer. I'm so sorry about that. Um, I'm on it. I'm on my job. I, I'm sorry, bro. Here's my information right here. I apologize, officer. I'm showing the customer the car. Right, I apologize. Then you step out of the car. Okay, so right now you're under arrest for reckless driving. Really? Yeah. I apologize, sir. I'm sorry. I don't care. Get out of the car. You're under arrest. Can I call my boss to let him know? In a little bit, but not right this moment. No, I. I don't know. Stand right here. Turn around. Face that direction. Put your hands behind your back. Is there anything I can do, officer? I'm sorry. Like, I'm sorry. You're. You're fuck old enough to know that. Kidding me? How do you know the exhaust is modified? Is that's not stock. Number one, I just bought this car. I get you saying you just bought it, but it's been modified. What's wrong? So if you disagree with me, which it sounds like you do, you and I go before court. What's wrong with the exhaust? I just told you. I'm citing you for modified exhaust. You can modify an exhaust? Since you disagree with me, you and I go to court, and I'll testify why I believe it's a modified. Can I ask what's wrong with it? Okay, telling you because it's loud and unusual. This is quieter than the trash truck that went by. So like I said, if you disagree with me, you and I go before the judge. We don't argue here. What do I need to know? To know what exhaust is good and what isn't good. To make sure that it's not loud or unusual. What's loud? You're not citing me for the decibels, right? Correct. So then what's loud? Exhaust. What's. You and I are going in circles. Okay, I don't understand what the problem is. You're. You're not testing me for the decibel. It has catalog the possibility that my brother's gun might be in this car, and my sister might Have something in there as well. Hey! Hey! Stop! She stopped in traffic. She may have wrecked. She wrecked out. Farce. Probably 10:16

No. What do you have on your arm? Oh, it's one of my students in the first period is ringworm. Ringworm? How do you know it's ringworm? Did you touch it? Of course not. But it was clearly an itchy red ring, so I just sent him home and sanitized every surface. That's not enough. Ringworm is an elementary school's worst enemy. Last time ringworm broke out, we lost half the staff and students, too, for a week. Thank god I've got immunity now. Barbie can't get immunity from ringworm. There's nothing to worry about here, guys. It's been handled. We're fine. Brandon, what are you doing back at school? I sent you home, but my mom sent me back. According to the district's website, my child doesn't have to be sent home until the end of the day. I kind of wanted to come back anyway. I let JoJo borrow my switch, and he still has it. Are you telling me you let some other kid touch your contaminated game? Bad! Bad, bad, bad! The ringworm kid is back in school. It's time to put your plan into place. Mr. Johnson, we need you to stand here 24 seven and block this floor by any means necessary. No one's getting past me. This is a complete overreaction. You're just mad that you're stuck on the second floor with patient zero. I love you like a son, Jacob, but I will beat you Down! It's not fair! And it is certainly no way to educate. Hey. Hey, baby. Where are you running off to? Let's stay here, you know? But it's time for recess. We get to skip recess today. Are you trapping us in here? Yes, you're trapped. Can I go use the bathroom? Sorry. You don't understand the kind of pressure I'm under. You don't understand the kind of pressure my bladder's under. Okay? Go to the bathroom. So what just happened? That hoodie. Gio, were you wearing that hoodie this morning? No. Where'd it come from? My brother gave it to me. When? Just now. Bring it to you from where? What floor is your brother on? Mr. Eddie? My arm itches. Fungi are here. You were just supposed to go to the bathroom. I actually forgot to go to the bathroom. Can I go to the bathroom now? Ah! How on earth could this happen?

Passengers and crew wrestled him to the ground, and eventually he was sedated. And when they checked his shoes, they discovered a fuse sticking out of each one. Turned out they were stuffed with enough explosives to bring down the entire plane. And that's why you have to take off your shoes at the airport. In 2018, a group of boys were exploring a cave in Thailand when suddenly the tunnels flooded with water and they became trapped. They were over two miles deep, and the flooding caused the tight tunnels to be completely filled with water. After 10 days, rescuers finally found them. But they had an extremely difficult time navigating the tunnels, and unfortunately, one even died during the operation. Because of this, they couldn't find a way to get the boys out safely. Their last option was to give them a sedative to knock them out, fit them with diving masks, and transport their unconscious bodies through the tunnels one by one. All 12 boys and their coach were safely rescued after 18 days underground. If you have lice in your hair, most people think they just crawl around and make your head itchy, but in reality, they use their sharp, spiky mouths to pierce your scalp. Once they've broken through the skin, they release a special saliva into the wound. This saliva contains Chemicals that make your blood thinner, so the lice can easily drink up your blood. But this also causes an allergic reaction, resulting in that intense itching sensation.

Soon it came to the last exciting step. As the doors closed one by one, a big magic black pipe sucked the people inside. When they were put down, everyone suddenly felt much lighter and had a perfect body at the same time. The factory door finally opened and a line of new beautiful women came out, showing their great bodies. But when the man looked, he didn't see His wife, Nikki. He turned around and saw Nikki slowly walking out. The operation was unsuccessful for her. However, even she didn't change much. She still showed herself in front of her husband.

Just when he thought he had succeeded, the morning bell rang in the distance. He immediately rushed over there, risking injury to stop the hammer from striking the bell. Yesterday, he saw the farmer sharpening an axe. At first, he didn't think much of it, but when he went to the chicken in coop, all the chickens were gone. He assumed the farmer had eaten them. He stole the axe and buried it in the ground. But while the farmer was watering, something unexpected happened. The axe started growing out of the ground like a plant. The farmer immediately pulled it out. The rooster panicked completely. After smoking all night, he still couldn't figure out a solution, so he decided to use someone else to do the dirty work. He smeared glue on a hat and stuck a toy duck on top, then kindly delivered the hat to the farmer. When the farmer walked into the rice field, the rooster blew a duck call, hoping to trick a hunter into attacking the farmer. But instead, the hunter fired at him, stripping all his feathers. Later, when the farmer went to collect eggs, the rooster secretly swapped one for a bomb, thinking the egg Was about to hatch. The farmer placed the rooster on top. The next second, the rooster's butt exploded into a flower. When the farmer came toward him with the axe, the terrified rooster ran away, only to realize the farmer just wanted to chop down a big tree.

A year later, the download bar finally hits the halfway point. He can't take it anymore. He slams his hand down on the computer in frustration. Suddenly, the progress bar starts going backward. He panics. He starts blowing on the screen, hoping to speed things up. Obviously, that doesn't work. Watching a year's worth of effort vanish, he collapses on the floor helplessly. He stares up at the computer from this upside down angle. Inspiration suddenly strikes. So he flips the monitor over right as the progress bar reaches zero. A notification pops up on screen. He thinks the game finally finished downloading, but instead the computer's disc drive opens. The disc falls out and hits the floor. Now he has to start the whole download over again.

She tried begging him to let her go, pleading that she was pregnant. But he didn't care. He beat her savagely, throwing punch after punch into her stomach. By the time the cops arrived, my wife was already dead. The guy raised his hands with a smirk still plastered on his face. I rushed into the house and saw my wife lying in a pool of blood. The pain was unbearable. I pulled out my gun, ready to blow this killer away. But my partner stopped me. The guy had already confessed. If I pulled the trigger now, it would be murder. I forced myself to hold back, teeth clenched. The killer's name was Victor. Six months earlier, I busted him for drug smuggling. First day out of prison, he came straight for me. I stared at this monster, completely helpless. As a cop, I had to let the law deal with him. After my wife died, revenge consumed every thought. So I shaved my head, loaded my gun, and prepared to execute a crazy plan. Using his file, I tracked down one of Victor's hideouts. Before making my move, I tipped off the police about the location and went in armed. Three punks inside had no idea what was coming. The next second, I burst through the door and Open Fire. 2 dropped instantly. The third tried to fight back, but I didn't give him a chance. When my partner Billy showed up, I was already on my knees with my hands behind my head. I went to prison for intentional homicide. That's exactly what I wanted, cause Victor was locked up in the same facility. But the moment I arrived, warden called me into his office. He knew why I was there and warned me not to cause trouble. He said Victor was his man now, and if anything happened, he wouldn't let anyone off the hook. Victor got word that I've been locked up, but he wasn't worried. This was his turf. This is my house. The next day, I got jumped by several guys in the laundry room. I could handle myself pretty well, but I couldn't take on multiple attackers at once. They eventually beat me down. Lucky for me, a guard showed up just in time. A few days later, I Learned from a guard that Victor had a deal with the warden. They were running some dirty business together. Victor used his connections to help the warden turn a profit, and in return, the warden kept him safe. I didn't say much after hearing that. No matter how much power he had, nothing was going to stop me from avenging my wife. Back in my cell, I started putting my revenge plan into action. I pulled a pen from under my bed, remove the ink cartridge, and sharpen the casing into a weapon.

This is so bad for you that even the Q Tip box says not to do it. But odds are you'll still use them even after watching this video. Why? Well, using Q tips leads to what dermatologists refer to as the itch scratch cycle. The more you use them, the more your ears itch. And the more your ears itch, the more you use them. Have you ever wondered what those little black dots are on your windshield? Well, if you look closely, you'll notice that they lead to a black band that goes all the way around. This is called a frit, and it's there to protect the glue that holds your windshield in place. But what about the dots? Well, because this band is black, it heats up fast, which can cause damage to your windshield. So they added dots to gradually even out the temperature. If you use a pore strip, an adhesive patch forcefully rips out blackheads from your nose, but it also strips the skin of its natural oils, which disrupts its protective barrier. This causes the skin to produce more oil to build the barrier back up, which can clog up your pores. And if you do this enough, it can actually end up causing you more blackheads.

Her companions assume she's just not strong enough, but oddly enough, no matter how hard the man pushes, the door seems completely locked. The man then throws his full weight against the door, but it still won't budge. Peering through the glass window, they realize something is blocking the door from the outside, preventing it from opening. As time passes, the sauna's heating system continues pumping out heat, and all three of them quickly begin struggling to breathe. Even worse, the high temperature starts causing various physical discomfort throughout their bodies. Refusing to just sit there and wait to die, the man spots the scorching hot stones and suddenly gets an idea. He wraps his hands in a towel, grabs one of the stones, and pours the last bit of their bottled water over it to cool it down. Once the temperature drops enough, he grips the stone and heads to the door, smashing it against the glass window repeatedly. Through his persistent efforts, the man successfully creates a crack in the glass. The woman immediately rushes over to breathe in the fresh air, then starts shouting for help. But at three in the morning, there's absolutely no one around to hear their cries. Plus, they're at a mountain hot spring resort there's no chance anyone would be passing by. Feeling desperate, they can only wait in the sauna. But The heater keeps running and the temperature continues climbing. If they don't figure something out soon, they'll all die from the heat tonight. Looking at the lamp in front of him, the man suddenly comes up with another plan. He decides to create a short circuit so the sauna will lose power. Without electricity, the heater would stop working. Impressed with his own cleverness, he quickly gets to work. First, he asks his companion to hand him a

Yet the man remained completely calm. Even after she fired every bullet, the glass didn't shatter. Seeing this, she went right up to the glass and knocked on it. The man, meanwhile, calmly continued to transfer data. Just then, the woman noticed a screen in the distance. She realized the computer's data was about to be stolen and time was running out. The woman decided to try a different route. Soon, the system displayed that a fingerprint verification was needed. The man quickly pulled up a body from the ground. The woman, on the other hand, went to the other side, quickly picking up a weapon from the floor. Then she went to the wall to test its thickness. By this time, the man had dragged the body to the computer and immediately used the corpse's hand for verification. The system quickly began to restart. The woman had also finished loading all her bullets. Just then, the the man noticed the woman was shooting through the wall, he quickly pulled out a handgun. Seeing the woman about to shoot through the wall, the man anxiously watched the progress bar. At that moment, the woman finally saw the steel door control button, and the man was also waiting nearby. The instant the woman pressed the button, both sides began furiously shooting at each other. Then their bullets ran out and they started to wrestle outside the door. A large number Of police officers had already arrived.

Within 30 minutes, he was caught and sentenced to three years in prison. This is one of the best instant karma clips I've seen. This truck pays the toll like normal and goes on its way. But the next truck behind it thought they were too important to pay the toll and tries to sneak by. The trucker breaks right through the barrier, but then look what happens. He blows out several tires. That's gonna cost him a lot. Plus any additional fines for skipping the toll. There's probably a pop up band. How fast did you pass the cop? Like 90. Five hundred.

But what no one realized was that the officer had a completely different plan in mind. What they did next was so unexpected it completely flipped the situation around. When this biker had a life threatening close call because of a reckless driver, he Was absolutely furious and turned around to confront him. But what happened next was insane because the driver blamed the biker. Look, I got kids in my motherfucking truck. Did you see what the fuck you just said? I don't care. But then his friend showed up. The driver turned out to be the biker's neighbor. While this biker was cruising down the road, he suddenly came across a truck spraying water all over to clean it, which was a serious problem because if he rode through it, he'd lose control and crash in instantly. So he started honking like crazy trying to get the driver's attention, but the driver completely ignored him and kept going. But then a random euros driver pulled up and did something unexpected that completely made the bikers day.

You see, eagles are known to drop them onto rocks to crack their hard shells open for an easy meal. Without hesitation, this eagle released the tortoise, sending it hurdling down towards the unsuspecting man below. The tortoise struck his head with deadly force, killing him instantly. And this bizarre death was documented by a Roman writer. In 1970, a doctor removed the head of a monkey and transplanted it with another one, painstakingly connecting the tissues in the neck to the donor head. Now, the monkey survived, regained consciousness and was able to see and hear. But the spinal cord couldn't be connected, so the monkey was unable to move its body. And while the procedure was technically successful, the monkey only lived for a few days. Have you ever wondered why McDonald's soda tastes so good? Well, the company claims it's because of their chilling process. But the true reason has less to do with the actual drink. You see, McDonald's straws are actually a little wider than normal. This allows more flavor and carbonation to hit your tongue, making you think the soda tastes better.

When searching for cracking methods online, only the victim's video was found. The moment she turned off the computer fear made her flee the room. In a panic she angrily smashed the mobile phone but the countdown still existed. The next day Jenny went to the mobile phone store to buy a new phone but the software was installed automatically. There was only one day left until the countdown. Suddenly a pair of hands covered her eyes and she drove the car to the back in a panic. When the car owner was about to lose his temper, Jack showed up and diffused the crisis. Coincidentally, he also downloaded this software. Amidst the two were thus tormented by the same curse and decided to join forces to find out the truth. They first found the priest and Learned that this was a code transformed from an ancient curse crack it they had to hire a computer expert then they found the owner of the mobile phone store through operation they found that the software had Recorded all the death lists.

Accordingly, the two reborn people gradually developed feelings for each other. In the middle of the night, Jenny faintly saw a figure at the door and wanted to wake Jack up.

Even though he was an invincible healer, able to instantly mend any wound, the hero's party leader still kicked him out, all because they thought they'd grown strong enough to never get hurt in battle. What they didn't realize was the only reason they never got injured was because Jack's healing magic was too good. He could close wounds at the exact moment they appeared, so they never even noticed they'd been hurt. After being cast out, Jack and an elf girl named Jenny opened a small clinic in the slums. In his country, healers were extremely valuable. There were even special academies for learning advanced healing. But only academy graduates with a license could legally practice. Jack, a poor commoner, had never received formal training. Everything he knew he'd taught himself. With no license, he worked as an underground healer. He treated the poor for free, but charged the rich a fortune. One day on his way to a house call, a noble stopped him. The man said his slave had gone berserk and attacked him. He begged Jack to hold her off long enough for him to get to a clinic, offering any reward in return. Just then, the Beast Woman lunged. Jack pulled the noble out of harm's way with ease and asked the girl why she was attacking. But she had lost all reason, grabbing a rock and swinging at him. Jack's agility saved him. He dodged without a scratch, seeing Jack. Jack's skill. The noble urged him to finish her off. Jack refused. My job isn't taking lives, he said flatly. The noble grew desperate. If this drags on, I'll be the one who dies. Slaves can be replaced. Just kill her. Jack remembered his own childhood and answer, I save every life I can. That's who I am. The noble was baffled. Jack explained that he was a healer. At that moment, the Beast Woman charged again. In the scuffle, Jack noticed something odd. He knocked her into a pile of rubble. And as she cried, she cried out in pain. That's when Jack realized she was possessed by an evil spirit. No wonder she'd gone mad. He cast his healing magic, closing her wounds and purging the spirit in one strike. The noble, stunned by Jack's power, immediately begged to be healed, too. But Jack said calmly, I'm off duty. Come back tomorrow. The noble went pale. Tomorrow I'll be dead by then, Jack smirked. Then it's overtime and that costs extra. The noble threw him a sack of gold. Jack sneered, it was far too little. The noble gave. That's already way above market. Do you want trouble for overcharging as a healer? Jack shrugged. I don't have a license. I'm a dark healer. And aren't you the same? Your little mess came from sending slaves to rob graves. The noble fell silent. Jack leaned in, cover the rest with her. I'll take the beast woman, the Noble agreed immediately. Take her. She's yours. Jack healed him, took the slave contract, and two hours later, the girl finally woke up. She stared at Jack, bewildered. He introduced himself and explained that he'd just bought her. Since he'd spent so much, he wanted to check her condition. He asked her to take off her clothes. She froze, hesitant, but a slave couldn't disobey an order. She braced for the worst, but Jack really was just examining her. In fact, he even removed the gallstones that had been tormenting her for years. The girl was overwhelmed with gratitude. Jack had not only saved her life, but also healed her illness. She asked how she could ever repay him. Jack said, simply, pay me back. That's enough. He needed an ingredient for stew. The girl checked the guidebook, then LED him straight to it. She was confused. That's it. I thought you'd make me do something harder. Jack smiled. This is enough. Then he tore up the slave contract. Now we're even. Meanwhile, the party leader never imagined the healer he'd thrown away had already united the three bosses of the slums. It all began when Jack stumbled upon a dying elf. He bought her with the only gold coin he had left. The boss laughed. Taking the deal, selling someone on death's door for even a coin, was a win. But to Jack, that fatal wound was nothing more than a minor cut.

They even carry it to a crowded area to show off, oblivious to its power to destroy a city. A villager suggests selling the bomb for food, so a few clueless villagers carry it to the city. Worried the bomb might overheat, they occasionally water it along the way, unknowingly accelerating its fuses. Hours later, they finally arrive in the city center. The mayor, seeing the bomb, is terrified. To prove it's safe, the villagers hit the bomb again with sticks. This causes the mayor to panic and order them to move the bomb far away immediately. Reluctantly, the villagers obey and move it to the seaside in front of the crowd. The two men toss the bomb into the ocean, and the mayor breathes a sigh of relief. The villagers are furious. They could have traded it for 100 tons of food, but now it's gone. As they walk away, the bomb explodes in the ocean. The blast stuns everyone. Before they can react, villagers rushed to the sea. The explosion has brought hundreds of tons of fish, ensuring the villagers will never go hungry again.

Then she walked towards her husband. Ernest! Ernest! Ah! Holy! Ah! Ah! The woman finally realized something was wrong. Looking in the mirror, she found that her head had turned to the back. Under her husband's terrified gaze, the woman held her head with both hands and directly twisted it back to the front. Later, the two went to the hospital for an examination. However, they found that the woman had no heartbeat and her blood had stopped flowing. The doctor determined that the woman was basically a living dead. Hearing this, the woman fainted completely.

After a while, a worker finally shut off the pump and the biker stood there in the mess terrified it might catch fire. I'm not fucking paying that. He was furious, but you gotta see what happened next when they tried to make him pay for it. Can I get a refund or not? You just doing your job and you what your manager is paying you but I'm not very happy cause I've now spent a lot more money than I have to. Is it fair that the biker had to pay? This biker was waiting behind a car when the driver suddenly started acting weird after taking off super late at a green light. The biker realised he was on his phone because he was driving way too slow. This biker found this giant snowpile and he suddenly threw a snowball at his friend who instantly ran away. But not before he threw a long shot, almost making a headshot. And his friend did not know that he was cooking up a revenge plan, so he started acting like normal so that his friend didn't suspect anything. So when he noticed the tunnel in front, he knew exactly where to play his little because while his friend was raging, he could only laugh at it. And when the time came, he grabbed another snowball and rushed to throw it before his friend noticed. But little did he know that his friend already had a plan, but he missed while.

A wanted poster this morning for a little elf that was causing some issues, and I was wondering if it was your elf. Have you seen. When was the last time you saw a snowflake? Um, have you seen snowflake this morning? No. So this is the picture that we got. Does that look like snowflake at all? She has the 2 2. The five year old owner of the Elf on the shelf in question was asked to help with the elf's identification. Then the officers LED her and her family to the Norfolk police station to bail out snowflake, whose crimes included swinging from the trees with candy canes and dumping marshmallows all over the city.

The police cruiser sped up and splashed Officer Dunn with a wave of very cold street water. So with that, please be safe today and stay dry. This man just got pulled over for having a tail light out.

This Corvette is all blacked out. He's got a 3 60 camera on the rear and no license plate I know 1,000% this guy will not stop for blue lights ever and how right he is. This Corvette taunts cops into chases for the thrill of it it worked for several months until he intentionally struck a police car this initiated a 30+ police car response and a helicopter which came to its climax in this parking lot. Retreat retreat. That same day he was tracked down to his home and they seized his car and over 100 pounds of stuff. He was arrested on 10 different charges, 4 of them felonies. He was re arrested two weeks later for a separate incident with his twin brother. More details are in the pinned comment. This guy made a huge mistake when he started to mess with a group of bikers. When the filming biker ran a red light because he was blinded by the sun, the guy got very angry and started following him to a gas station. Despite the biker being apologetic the guy then slapped him resulting in a 3 versus 1 fight but what happened next when the guy still wasn't humbled enough and pulled his phone was crazy. This biker found his stolen bike on Craigslist and decided to meet the thief but you won't believe how bad it ended. After riding for a while he noticed The thief is a kid. Yeah, you're selling this thing? Yeah, let me check it out. After he examined the bike, he confirmed his doubts and decided to confront the thief. And what happened next is pure madness. It's the same, it's the same exact plate. Don't even play stupid. It's the same plate. Don't play stupid with me, boy. It's the same plate. What are you gonna do about it? I'm gonna call the police.

The more I tried to grab it, the more it slipped away between my fingers. Then my uncle came home from work. Terrified, I ran straight to my room. He had no idea what was happening. Later, I decided I had to uncover the secret of this red string. So I went outside and started watching people carefully. I understood these strings revealed who was connected to whom. Some were friends, some lovers. Every special bond glowed with a red thread. My fear faded, replaced by curiosity and confidence. The next day at school, I walked tall. Then I saw her, the girl who always bullied me. But what shocked me most, her red string wasn't connected to another student. I LED straight to our literature teacher. That secret gave me power. When she tried to pick on me again after class, I didn't stay quiet, pushed her. She fell to the ground. Enough, said a voice behind me. It was Emma, the new transfer student. The bully tried to scare her, too, but Emma wasn't someone to mess with. She grabbed the bully, dragged her to the edge of the roof and whispered, let's jump together. The bully froze in horror. She didn't know Emma had tried to end her life before and survived every time. That night, I followed the bully in secret. She met the literature teacher and they went to a hotel together. When The teacher went to the bathroom. I texted her. She replied coldly, I'm underage. No one can touch me. I was stunned. She wasn't scared. She was proud. So I made a choice. Next day, I sent all the evidence to the teacher and demanded, give me 20 million or I'll expose everything. Panicked, he paid. I thought I'd won. But that same day, in the bathroom, Emma cornered me. And when I saw her eyes, I realized she could see the red strings, too.

But only one of them gets to win the glory in this epic showdown. These roads were too icy to drive on, so this sheriff was out closing them off. But when his partner rolled up to help, this partner's cruiser immediately started sliding off the road and into a ditch, becoming the perfect example of why the roads were closed in the first place. Caitlin's husband had just gotten home from a long day's work as a police officer and he had no idea she was about to surprise him with some super exciting news. Honey, what? Pack your bags. What?

Before the man could react, one monster grabbed his arm. Levi, when the woman saw this, she kicked that monster off the cliff with all her strength. But just then, thousands of monsters swarmed toward them. Their car was about to collapse under the weight and fall. The man quickly handed a wooden box to the woman, telling her to jam the car's accelerator with it. The car automatically climbed up along the cliff. But before the two could catch their breath, the monsters attacked again. The man picked up a large machete, swung it wildly and fought against the monsters. It the monsters climbed up, they would be trapped here. The woman also showed no fear. She picked up an axe and chopped at the monsters. They knocked all the monsters off the cliff, but before they could recover from the shock, suddenly another monster rushed over. No. Luckily, the man grabbed the guardrail in time, but the monsters kept swarming in waves. So the man made a brave decision. He took out a small knife and stabbed it deeply into the fuel tank. Gasoline immediately flowed toward the monsters. The man didn't hesitate for a second. He quickly climbed onto the car, opened an incendiary bomb and threw it down. The flames triggered a chain reaction. The monsters were soon burned to ashes. But when the flames spread to the fuel tank, the tank exploded, blowing the monsters into the air. Luckily, The two dodged the explosion with their agile movements to completely eliminate all danger. The woman cut the steel cable completely. They finally got rid of the monster's attack completely.

Thankfully the baby came through without a hitch. But the woman stared in sheer terror. She noticed the child's face looked eerily like the rapists. Her therapist dismissed it as pure delusion. She insisted the attackers fluids had tainted her unborn child. As the kid grew up before her eyes, she couldn't shake that filthy nightmare. One gloomy morning, she finally snapped. The broken woman leaped off the building with the child in her arms. After his wife's death, her husband, a psychiatrist, shattered completely. Yet he soon found a reason to keep breathing. The rapist had only gotten four years behind bars. And when he spotted the guy in court, a sneer curled at the corner of his mouth. Alan vowed revenge. He dove into ways to make someone suffer endlessly without letting them slip away into death, all so the bastard could writhe in agony four years from now. But on the day of the thug's release, he Learned the man had fried in a prison electrical mishap. Alan plunged back into bottomless despair until one patient's story pulled him out. It gave him fresh purpose to endure. The patient's wife had been killed by a drunk driver. His eight year old son lay in a vegetative state. He lode the culprit with every fiber, but his boy's condition held him back from vengeance. Alan saw his own shattered self from four years ago. So he asked the man. Point Blank, want me to take out the driver for you? Alan drugged the perp and tied him to a cross. He approached with a hammer in hand. The driver gaped in raw horror. At the scene, Alan met his gaze with icy detachment. Then he swung the hammer and bashed the man's skull in. As the patient watched his enemy bleed out, a genuine smile broke across his face. At last, the doctor felt the sweet rush of redemption. Over time, he treated 10 more patients, crushed by trauma. Each time he had to end someone's life. He became the nation's most notorious serial killer. That day, Alan reached out to a female reporter. He confessed outright that he was the killer and requested a private one on one interview. The reporter showed up with a detective in tow at a quiet hotel downtown. Alan had booked the room under her name. During check in, she clocked that all the security cams were down for repairs. Before stepping inside, she slipped the spare key card into the elevator, then ducked into the bathroom. She tucked a tiny earpiece communicator into place and covered it with a sweep of her hair. It was her only lifeline to the cop. The reporter entered room 27, 0, 1, while the detective slipped into 2,601 below. He planted hidden cameras all over the space so he could watch every move inside. Then they settled in to wait for Alan's arrival.

Guide her steps and lead her away from danger and temptation. Let your presence be her shield and her comfort in times of trouble. Lord, I pray for her emotional and mental well being. Fill her with your peace and joy and let your love be a constant source of strength and encouragement. When she faces challenges and uncertainties, remind her that she is never alone, for you are always with her. Father, I pray for her spiritual growth. Draw her closer to you each day and deepen her faith. Help her to know and trust you more.

The room was packed with famous authors. The most eye catching was Nick, now 50 years old, widely known as a literary giant. At the event, Emma not only Learned a ton about literature, but was also deeply drawn to this charming man. His presence and words radiated pure masculine charm. The next day, Emma made a special trip to the bookstore to find more literary works. Since that meeting, she often got letters from Nick. The letters explained words she didn't get, but also brought a strange feeling, like some secret silently followed them. It was Emma's first brush with love. Torn between excitement and confusion, she carefully penned all these feelings in her diary. At the second book club, Emma's mom showed up again. But this time, Emma noticed her mom was getting close with another author. That scene stirred deep and new emotions inside Emma's heart.

Then they used a fan to dry the glue quickly. When the glue set, they cut a hole with a knife. After that, they added a pair of glasses. They originally thought John could only hold out for a few days at most, but they didn't expect him to be stuck in the lab. As time went by, John got more and more irritable. Finally, one day, he escaped. When John got home, he saw his neighbor changing clothes at home. However, at the crucial moment, the woman pulled up the curtain. John looked at himself in the mirror and suddenly realized he had the ability to be invisible. This meant he could do whatever he wanted. So just after the woman finished taking a shower, there was a knock on the door. The woman walked to the door but found there was nothing outside. She thought it might be her imagination, but unexpectedly, the doorbell rang again. The next second, the woman was a bit confused and then walked to the door and opened it, but the corridor was empty. However, just then, John sneaked into the woman's house without making a sound.

No magic comes from nothing. The teacher lifted a bouquet. The flowers wilted instantly. A stone rose into the air. My classmates copied her. Their stones floated in the air. I tried again and again. I failed. Every time teacher came up to me, she scolded me for rushing, for trying to use magic to make myself pretty. I was born with a curved spine. My mouth was crooked. I was ugly. In class, I was always the slowest. I broke down. I looked at myself in the mirror. I sobbed out loud. The next day, the teacher took us to the seagull tower. She told us to hold up bottles to catch lightning. Dora went first. She lifted her bottle carefully. The lightning knocked her out. Annie went next. She hesitated for a moment. She caught the lightning. The bottle shattered. When it was my turn, I gave the teacher a cold glance. I gathered my courage. I raised the bottle high. Lightning struck my chest. It slammed me into the wall. I watched the other succeed. I kept failing. I saw the disappointment in the teacher's eyes. I felt utterly insignificant. Humiliation, resentment, they flooded me. Anger lit up inside me. The teacher saw my potential. She told me inner beauty is the true beauty. She told me not to let anger consume me. That night, the teacher took the girls who failed the exam away. I followed secretly. I watched her turn. The three students into eels. She already knew I was behind her, she told me. She only took away their control. They would provide energy for the academy like flowers. Their best purpose was to wither. Right after the teacher prepared to give me a flawless face, I stared at my ugly reflection. She told me to close my eyes to imagine the most beautiful woman in the world. And then.

I was the only one who actually cooked in our four person house. Every Sunday, I spent hours preparing healthy meals for the week. My three roommates survived on delivery apps and whatever they could steal from my containers. It was just missing Tupperware. Jeff would shrug after eating my chicken and rice, sorry, I was drunk and hungry, became his favourite excuse. Soon, entire rows of meals would vanish overnight. My grocery budget evaporated into their stomachs. They still complained about being too broke for groceries. Bieber was the worst offender by far. I spent three hours one Sunday making lasagna for the week. He ate the entire tray while I was at work. When I confronted him, he just laughed in my face. Maybe if you weren't obsessed with containers, you'd find someone to cook for besides yourself. Bieber's girlfriend, Taylor, basically moved in without paying rent. She didn't just eat my food like the others. She photographed my meals for her Instagram before destroying them. Her captions claim she made everything herself. She promoted her meal prep journey while eating my entire week's food in two days. My containers would disappear into her car for weeks, return stained, warped and sometimes mouldy. I tried the polite approach. One evening I asked if they could reimburse me for groceries. Taylor rolled her eyes dramatically at my request. It's just food. You're Being really weird about this. Never. Immediately took her side without hesitation. Yeah, stop being so territorial. Sharing is caring, right? Our house meeting was my final attempt at reason. I spend $80 weekly on groceries. You guys eat most of it. Can we please work out a system? Jeff jumped in with his prepared complaints. Your meal prep takes up the entire fridge. Maybe stop hoarding space with containers. Then we'd have room for our own food. Bieber grinned and added his support. Exactly. Stop filling the fridge with your stuff. Problem solved. They actually high fived each other. I stood there processing their audacity. Something shifted inside me at that moment. I smiled sweetly. You know what, you're absolutely right. Malicious compliance became my new favourite recipe. I stopped using containers immediately. Just as requested. Every night I cooked elaborate aromatic meals instead. The house filled with smells of garlic, herbs and sizzling meat. I made exactly one portion and ate it immediately. Nothing went in the fridge ever. The kitchen.

The psychological warfare intensified over the following days. I timed my cooking for when they were hungriest. Sunday football meant buffalo wings and loaded potato skins.

You know, when you can tell someone's really into their phone, like they're really on their phone. Yeah, that was her, which is like the whole night when you're meeting people. Yeah, exactly. Is that the reason though, is Like she could have been nervous, right? No, it's because of what she was doing on her phone.

Don't let them do any procedures on you until I get there. Mom, are you serious right now? Excuse me? Ben is 12, mom. 12 years old. He can stay home alone. He's not a little baby anymore. He can entertain himself. He doesn't need to be connected to you at the hip all the time. Or tell him to grow the hell up and just come to the hospital.

It's on the school website. But you never even watched it. Elizabeth, please let me talk. I'm packing a bag right now. I'm going to bring Ben to his friend's house and head to you. No. All you do is talk, and all I do is listen. I'm done. Mom, I want you to hear me. Please, Mommy, hear me. I'm listening, Beth. I'm listening. I hate myself. I feel like I'll always be nothing. You've made me feel like I'll forever be nothing. Like I'll never matter. And honestly, maybe I won't ever matter.

And I hate that all I do is please other people. Beth, I'm on the way right now. Please just wait until I get there. We can talk, okay? Actually, no, I will listen. I will. I promise. And you talk. I'm sorry. I know I should have said it sooner. Yeah, you're right. You should have. And it's too late for sorry. At least this way, you can finally put that college fund of mine towards Ben's dreams like you've always wanted to. Elizabeth, what are you Talking about. What are you doing? Elizabeth? Elizabeth? Elizabeth, please answer me. Beth, please pick up the phone. I'm five minutes away. Mommy. So sorry.

Don't tell me you forgot what today is. Mom, not now, please. My girlfriend Anna is in labor. We're at the ER. Our baby is coming. So you did forget. I guess your little girlfriend made sure of that, huh? Of course she'd go into labor today on my birthday. What a coincidence. Are you serious right now? You think Anna planned this? She's going through it right now. The doctor said they don't know if she'll be okay. Oh, please. That girl has always had a flare for drama. She does this every stinking time. Every time I try to see you, something urgent comes up. I haven't seen my sweet boy in months. Mom, you really think she's faking this to make me miss your birthday? Are you actually that jealous of her? I see right through her. She's been trying to pull you away from me since the moment she met you. Last time you missed dinner because of period cramps. Oh, please. That girl will say anything to keep you from spending time with me. Are you out of your mind? Anna is about to risk everything, bringing in your grandchild, and you're going on some jealous rant? Don't yell at me. You wouldn't even be here if it weren't for me. I carried you. I raised you, and you're choosing her over your own mother on my 50th birthday? Because this is serious. Anna could lose it all, and you're crying about cake? And candles. That girl stole you. She made you cold. You used to call me every night. Now I have to beg to hear your voice. Do you know how that feels? I'm not a little boy anymore. I'm a father now. And you refuse to accept that. You changed the day you met her. You stopped coming over. You didn't show up for the family cookout. You said you were tired. But I know it was her. And now I spent weeks planning this birthday dinner. Everyone's here. Your uncle, your aunt, even grandma. And my son's seat is empty. Did you even freaking hear what I said? The doctor said Anna's fate is uncertain, and you're talking about a dinner? You were my baby first. All I wanted today was a hug from my son. One picture, one memory. You think your little family matters more than the one that raised you? That is the most selfish thing I've ever heard. You're evil. You want me to leave the woman I love? Well, she's fighting for everything. Just so you don't feel left out. Cantina. Ask. Bring Robert. Help me cook. My son for choosing his girlfriend over his own mother. Tell him. Bro really peed his pants at 16 and thinks he's grown. If your girl knew she'd vanish, but mommy still cleaned it up. Bro really peed his pants at 16 and thinks he's grown. If Anna knew she'd vanish, but mommy still cleaned it up. Mom, I swear it's Cantina app roast bot, son. Get it? I just want my son back. I want the boy who made me laugh, the boy who asked me to braid his hair, who watched Disney movies with me on the couch. Now all I see is this bitter, distant man, and it's all because of her. Wow. You know what? I hope one day you realize how insane you sound. And until that day comes, I never want to talk to someone as selfish as you again. You don't mean that. Please tell me you don't mean that. Chris. Chrissy, baby, don't do this to your mama. Chrissy. You selfish, freaking brat! Do you even realize what you just did to your mother? Dad, not you, too. Are you really siding with her on this? Anna is in labor. Don't you dare try to flip this. You hurt your mother on her 50th birthday. She'll be fine. She always does this. I'm sorry, but I had to stand up for Anna. No, she's not fine. She. He's in the ER. What? What are you talking about? After you told her you never wanted to see her again. It hurt bad. I had to take her there. Oh, my god, dad, I didn't mean for that to happen. Don't give me that crap. You know your mother has. You knew what you were doing when you did that, and for what? Some freaking cake? Anna is in labor! They Don't know what will happen. I had no choice. There's always a choice. And you made yours. Don't call me dad anymore. It's Peter to you now. Dad, no.

Your mom called me asking if I knew where you were. I told her you were in my house, in the bathroom, just to cover for you. But seriously, where are you? It's been a day now. Elio. Your mom's freaking out, and honestly, so am I. She called the police. I haven't told them that I lied for you. I keep telling her you're here, but I have no idea where you are. Please come home. I'm getting really worried. I asked my favorite astrology app, Astro App, for advice and it said that I'm a cancer, so I can get really emotional when I feel abandoned. It told me to take deep breaths and focus on grounding myself so I can stay calm and clear minded while waiting to hear from you. Elio, it's been a week. Everyone saying you're missing. Like actually missing. Your mom's been crying non stop and they filed a police report. Where are you? What's going on, Ello? It's been a month now. They still can't find you. I don't even know what to tell people anymore. I got a cat to help with the loneliness, I guess. I named him Charlie. Figured you'd like that. Wish you could see him. She's really sweet. Sleeps with me every night. She and was born on Valentine's Day too. Hahaha. It's been two months since you disappeared. I stopped writing to you because it felt like screaming into the void. Your mom's pregnant. Can You believe that? Guess there'll be another Elio around soon. I miss you so much, Elio. 10 months now. Your sister's almost here. Her name is going to be Julia. I keep hoping you'll walk through the door before she's born. Ello, it's been two years. I know that sounds insane, but part of me still thinks you're coming back. I can't move on from this. Everyone tells me to, but I can't. It's like a piece of me went missing with you. Hey. I need to tell you this. I'm getting married. I found someone who loves me. I think you'd like him. He's the love of my life. And I'm finally getting married. I asked for star rings so you'd be here with me in some way. I miss you more than ever right now. Ilio. It's been five years. I don't know what to say anymore. But I'm still here. They closed your case, the police. No one's looking for you anymore. But I'll never stop. I'm thinking of searching for you on my own, but in secret. Oh, and I'm pregnant. It's a boy. I'm naming him Ilio, after you. Hey. Wow. I didn't even realize we're still having this conversation. It's been seven years. My son's been born. Look. I think he looks a bit like you. He's as cute as you were. Or maybe that's just me imagining things. Wish you could see him. Hey, Elio. It's been 11 years. He's turning four today. Time flies, doesn't it? Feels like yesterday when I last saw you. He really admires you, you know. I always tell him how great you were as a boyfriend. He says you're still alive, that we're so connected. That's why I feel like you're still around. But I don't know. Sometimes I lose faith in you coming back. I wonder if he's right. I still feel you somehow, Ello. It's been 14 years. My new boyfriend tells me I need to move on. Says I'm holding on too tight. But my son, he still believes you're coming back. He's only a kid, but he has more faith than I do by now. It's been 20 years, Elio. Wow. My boy's nine now. He's getting so big. And guess what? I'm pregnant again. With a girl. She's due in four months, and I'm naming her Jula. Like your sister. Speaking of, your sister moved back in with your parents. She's not doing well. She barely speaks to anyone. It's like everything fell apart when you left. Elio, it's been 25 years. I built the house we dreamed of. Remember that? I also got divorced, though. He cheated on me. Now it's just me, Elio, Julia, and the cat. Still waiting for you, I guess. I miss you more than I can put into words, Elio. You have no idea. Every single day. Bria. The fuck you mean I died? I was just having some burger and fries. You're already planning my Funeral chill. You can now check part two by pressing share. Then more.

My brother's wife, Diana, discovered her ultimate weapon the day she lost her first pregnancy. If someone questioned her spending, she'd clutch her stomach and call them insensitive. If anyone in the family shared good news, she'd leave the room wailing that their happiness was triggering her grief. If my brother asked her to help with anything, she'd collapse on the couch claiming the stress could cause another loss. The manipulation quickly went from tears to total destruction. First, Diana got my mom's 60th birthday party canceled by claiming the pink decorations triggered her loss. Mom spent her milestone birthday comforting Diana instead. When my cousin announced her pregnancy, Diana screamed that we were rubbing fertility in her face and claimed the shock caused her to have a panic attack. My cousin hid her entire pregnancy in shame. Then Diana wanted a 70 thousand dollar Mercedes, but my brother said no. So she staged a total breakdown at the dealership, wailing about needing a safe car for her rainbow baby and threatened to divorce if my brother didn't buy it. She didn't spare me either and went all out during my wedding planning. Diana called all my vendors claiming my flower choices would trigger miscarriages, posted on wedding forms that I was a baby killer, and demanded I change my date because it was near her loss anniversary. When I refused. She told family members that my selfishness had caused her to lose twins, and I know it might be hard to believe, but she went even further. I was four months pregnant and had managed to hide it from everyone except Diana, who'd noticed my subtle changes. One morning, she ambushed me at a doctor's appointment with an offer that made my blood freeze. I know you're pregnant, she said calmly. Here's what's going to happen. You're going to tell everyone you're carrying a baby for me as a surrogate. You'll give birth, hand the baby to me, and I'll finally be the mother. Everyone pities me for not being. I laughed, thinking she was joking, but she wasn't. If you refuse, I'll tell everyone you've been mocking my miscarriages throughout your pregnancy. She showed me her phone with drafted emails to my employer about my workplace harassment regarding her infertility, and even had screenshots of edited text where I called her an infertile bitch. She'd been planning this for weeks. I smiled sweetly when she saw how horrified I was and added, besides, you can always have another one. Standing there with my hand protectively over my bump, realizing Diana literally wanted to steal my child, I felt rage unlike anything before. I knew Diana's weakness was her need to maintain her victim story at all costs. She'd already sent me those fake texts and threatened emails, not knowing she was handing me evidence. So I did Something simple. I scheduled a meeting with my brother at his office, saying I needed to discuss the surrogacy arrangement Diana had proposed. When he arrived, confused, I broke down crying and showed him Diana's threatening text about taking my baby. I'm scared she'll hurt herself or the baby if I don't give in. She keeps saying this is her only chance at motherhood. My brother's face went white. He checked the time stamps on her threats and said, wait, these are from yesterday morning when she was with me at the mall. The realisation broke him. His wife had been plotting to steal his sister's baby while shopping right beside him. My brother spent three days processing everything before deciding to confront her on Mother's Day, Diana's favourite stage for sympathy. Whole family would be there, including my cousin, who'd hidden her pregnancy, and my mom, who'd lost her 60th birthday Celebration. I arrived late, seven months pregnant now and unable to hide anymore. Diana's eyes locked on my belly and she began explaining how my visible pregnancy was triggering severe cramping. Classic Diana, already spinning my presence into her trauma. That's when my brother pulled out his phone. I have something to say. Diana tried to force my

Thank you, Jacob. Okay, bye now. Bye. Jacob! Jacob, guess what? I had soccer practice today and I made A new friend? Lol. Remember when you used to make fun of me for only having one friend? Jokes on you, now I made another friend. Hello? I said I made another friend. Jacob, guess what? I had another game today. It was 9 to 8, and we won by one point. And I was the one that broke the tie and made my team win. Are you proud of me, Jacob? Leah, you've been texting me a lot recently, but I don't like you anymore like I used to. Well, of course I still love you. But at the same time, I don't want to talk to you. I meant that I have moved on and we can't be talking anymore. Whatever. Leah, are you okay? I'm sorry about what I said to you last night. I didn't mean that I don't wanna talk to you. What I meant was that you really need to move on. I would love to talk to you if I could, but, you know, I'm meeting someone else. You need to get over it. Please. Jacob, I quit soccer. What? But it's been your dream for so long, and you finally got into the team. Why would you quit? I know, but I've been struggling to motivate myself and I haven't been feeling the best. Leah. Leah! Leah, answer my call. Leah, I'm coming over and we're talking about this. You should go back to soccer and continue following your dream. You shouldn't Quit. Everything will be okay. I promise. Leah

Where did you hear that date? It was in the note with Dad's watch. The watch you said was destroyed. Emma, where are you right now? Still at Jessica's. Her mom's about to drive me home. Number? Go to Aunt Claire's instead. Don't come home. You're scaring me. What's going on with these texts from Dad's number? Someone is trying to manipulate you. Your father died in that accident last month. Then why is his watch here? Why does someone know about July 15th? Your father's former partner must have gotten access to his personal effects. What partner? You said dad worked alone. I needed to protect you from certain aspects of his work. There's another text. Ask about the offshore account in the Caymans. Don't respond to any more messages. They're trying to get information. Information about what? What was dad involved in? Your father was an accountant for some powerful people. He found discrepancies. Criminal discrepancies. Was dad in danger? We're in the car now. Jessica's mom is acting strange. She keeps checking her mirrors. Is she taking you to our house or to Claire's? Neither. We're heading toward the lakehouse where the text said to go. Emma, that's not Jessica's mother. The real Carol has a scar on her wrist. She's wearing long sleeves. I can't tell. Ask to use her phone. Say yours is dying. She refused. Said her battery is low, too. Try to get a look at her wrist. Find An excuse. I asked her to check the time. No scar. Mom, who is this woman? Listen carefully. When she slows down at the next intersection, unlock your door and run. She just locked all the doors from her control panel. Is there anything in the car you can use as a weapon? Jessica's field hockey stick is in the backseat. I'm 10 minutes from the lakehouse. Is she still heading there? Yes. She just got a call. She's speaking another language. Sounds Eastern European. Your father's files exposed an international money laundering operation. Dad was just an accountant. How did he get involved in this? He was recruited specifically because of his skills. He didn't know what they were hiding. She's pulling over at the convenience store. Says she needs cigarettes. This is your chance. Get out while she's inside. I can't. She took the keys and told me she'll be watching through the window. Check the glove compartment. Is there anything useful? There's a gun, mom. A real gun. Don't touch it. It could be a setup. She's coming back. She's talking to someone outside the car. Take a photo of them. Discreetly, if you can. Done. Sending it now. That's Andre Kozlov. He worked with your father's firm. We're driving again. They're taking me to the lakehouse. The watch, Emma, is there anything unusual about it? The back has a small SD card taped to it. I never noticed before. That's what they want. Your father must Have copied the evidence. Should I destroy it? No. It's the only leverage we have. It's evidence of their entire operation. We're at the lakehouse. There's a black SUV waiting. I'm two minutes away. Can you see who's in the SUV? It's Mister Peterson from Dad's office. The one who spoke at his funeral. He's the one who recruited your father. He's been leading this whole operation. She's making me get out of the car, stall, ask questions, keep them talking until I get there. Peterson says he just wants the watch and we'll be safe. He's lying. They can't leave witnesses. He's showing me a badge. FBI. Is that possible? Huh? Boost for part three.

Because when Robert and I first started dating, he got me really drunk and told me I should be with him, not Robert. Jason, is, uh, is this true? No, it's not true. You can't believe anything that comes out of this little mouth, you know, which isn't a lot. There's usually so much going in. Oh, Wow. Oh, my god. Okay, alright, alright, settle down, settle down. Why don't we hear from, like, Robert? What about. What about you? What does Robert have to say? Yeah, Robert. What did you wanna say about all this, Robert? Is Robert still on line three?

Okay, first of all, why were you in the bathroom together? Just ask him. Jason, you. All I can say is she's a liar. And as we know now, she's a cheater too. Okay.

I was 12 when a man in a blue pickup truck pulled up next to me while I was walking home from school. He asked if I wanted to earn $20 helping him move boxes. My parents had always warned me about strangers, but $20 seems like a fortune to a kid who got $5 allowance. The the moment I got in his truck, I knew I'd made a terrible mistake. He immediately locked the doors and started driving in the opposite direction of where he said we were going. When I asked where we were headed, he told me to shut up and sit still. He drove for what felt like hours to a small cabin in the woods. No neighbours, no cell towers, nothing but trees. He dragged me inside and tied me to a chair in what looked like a basement. The smell was awful, like something had died down there. For the first two days, he barely spoke to me except to bring stale bread and warm water. I cried constantly, begging him to let me go home. He just stared at me with these cold, empty eyes and said my parents probably hadn't even noticed I was gone yet. On the third day, he made a mistake. He left his phone on the table while he went upstairs to make himself lunch. I could hear him moving around in the kitchen above me. Rope around my wrists, Had loosened slightly from struggling, and I managed to work one hand free. I grabbed his phone and called the first number I could think of, my mom's work number that she'd made me memorize for emergencies. When she answered, I whispered as quietly as I could, mom, I've been kidnapped in a cabin somewhere. There are tall pine trees everywhere, and I can hear a train in the distance. Before I could say more, I heard his footsteps coming down the stairs. I quickly put the phone back and got my hand back in the rope just as he appeared. He looked at me suspiciously, but didn't seem to notice anything different. What I didn't know was that my mom had immediately called the police while staying on the line. They traced the call and started searching for cabins near train tracks in our area. Meanwhile, she kept calling his phone every few minutes, hoping I'd answer the next morning. He seemed agitated, kept looking out the windows and pacing around the cabin. I realised later that police helicopters had been circling the area, getting closer to finding us. He started talking about moving me somewhere else, which terrified me. That afternoon, he went outside to load something into his truck. I heard him talking to someone on the phone, getting angry. While he was distracted, I noticed he'd left the basement door unlocked. This was my chance. I quietly climbed the stairs and saw him through the window. Still arguing on the phone by his truck. The front door was about 15 feet away. I knew I had to be smart about this. If I ran straight out, he'd see me immediately. Instead, I crawled on my hands and knees toward the back of the cabin. There was a small window near the floor that looks like it might be big enough for me to squeeze through. I managed to push it open and wiggle through, scraping my arms and legs on the frame. Once outside, I ran as fast as I could toward the sound of the train tracks. I figured if I could reach them, I might find help, or at least know which direction LED back to civilization. My legs felt like jelly from being tied up for days, but pure adrenaline kept me moving. After running for about 10 minutes, I heard dogs barking in the distance. Then I heard voices calling my name. It was the search and rescue team my mom had called in. I screamed as loud as I could and kept running toward the voices. A police officer

So if I were you, bro, I would be careful. He raised an eyebrow and explained that he was only there to get free food and to try to make me jealous enough to give her another chance. It was the stupidest thing I had heard. I looked over at my ex's face was super red with embarrassment and realized that it was actually true. I felt a serious rush of ego boost, but at the same time, I felt something unexpected too. Like, dude, call me stupid. But I felt pretty touched that she would go this far just to try to win me back. It definitely wasn't the best way to win me back, but definitely creative. So I told her jokingly that if she really wanted me back, she should try showing up here alone for another month to prove that she really meant it. I walked off to finish the rest of my shift. After that, she really did show up every day with a book or journal sitting at the same booth waiting for my shift to finish. I didn't even really talk to her much and she still came around. Weeks went by and on the last day of the month, she walked into Waffle House with a huge smile on her face. I walked over with her usual order and sat beside her in the booth. She asked me, If I would finally be her boyfriend again. I smiled back and said, absolutely not. I reminded her that she cheated on me with several guys and one of them was my best friend. She picked up the glass of water and thought about splashing it all over me. Instead, she splashed water on her own face to wake herself up and left, angrily ripping up one of the menus in the restaurant out of frustration before walking out the front door. The entire angry scene was crazy cute, like, ah, there goes my little Harley Quinn. I grinned and told my manager that I was finally quitting. I chased after her and apologized, saying that I wanted to get back at her a little for the horrible mess she put me through before I unzipped my jacket and wrapped it around her head to help her stay warm. After seeing water still drip down from her hair, I took her home that night and we talked about setting new boundaries if we wanted the relationship to work better this time. To this day, we're still together and no longer the toxic kids we used to be. Also for our prenup, we had a fun photo shoot at that same Waffle House, forever reminding us of our ridiculous and petty days.

I work at a Waffle House as one of the cooks and my ex girlfriend likes to come around and set up each of her dates there only when she knows I'm working. It had been four months since our breakup, so I didn't really understand why she would waste effort coming around and showing off that she could easily land a guy. It really bothered me at first watching her laugh and enjoy each date just like how we used to. I even thought about burning their food or putting something weird in. I settled for making their food extra salty for fun. After seeing the 3rd and 4th guy, I got used to it and just treated them like another customer with no connection to me. Eventually, my ex girlfriend settled with a guy I like to call Beanie based on the black and green beanie had he liked to wear on every date. They visit Waffle House about twice a week after class. I wasn't really suspicious about their relationship or anything until I was given a different shift. They ended up changing their meal time to match my schedule. That's when I started to really think about why they kept coming around and why they needed to go out on a date while I was there at work. Like, was I really that great of a chef here? So during my break one time, I decided to Walk over and ask them why they kept coming around to have a date specifically. While I was on the clock, my ex girlfriend sipped on her Sprite and asked, what do you mean? Are you saying we're doing this on purpose? I nodded and said, yeah, that's exactly what I was implying. She sighed and leaned back in her seat, crossing her arms before looking up at me and asking, are you just jealous? I sighed, feeling like I wasted my time and said, why would I be jealous when I'm the one who broke up with you in the first place? Her mouth flung open to argue back, but I tired my attention to Beanie and said.

It just bugs me and triggers me because it's like crazy to me. Yes, there's a double standard, but it exists for a reason. Look, I mean, you could go out tonight and find 100 dudes that would wanna sleep with you. You're a pretty woman, got good energy, guarantee you could get laid by 100 different guys throughout the city. For guys, totally different story. I'm a decently good looking guy compared to the average. I don't think I'm like an ultra giga Chad. But like even for a guy like me, like it's the number of women that I could sleep with compared to the number of men that you could sleep with, it's a huge differential. And the reason why there is a double standard is because if a woman wants to rack up a very high body count, like if a woman wants to sleep with 100 guys, all she has to do is open her legs. If a guy wants to sleep with 100 women, he has to become an absolute stud in order to do so. That doesn't mean that it's okay for him to do so. I totally disagree with men sleeping with tons of women. I think it's bad for society. I also think it's bad for society for women to sleep with a lot of Men. And one of the signs of a high value woman is a woman who can.

Fortunately, the man runs fast enough to escape with his life. Having Learned his lesson, the oil thief spares no expense and directly hires Jimmy, the industry's top drilling expert, for a hefty fee of 200 million. Compared to the previous novice, Jimmy is much more professional. He starts by setting a three minute countdown timer, then calmly inserts the drill bit into the pipeline. When he has drilled halfway through, he even injects coolant to lower the drill bit's temperature. Now comes the most critical part. Just before the drill breaks through the pipe, Jimmy suddenly stops. He then calmly connects an oil transport pipe to the drilling point. It turns out he plans to use the oil pressure to automatically burst through the last millimeter of thickness he left behind this way.

And when the mom duck realized how steep this was, she was realizing her babies probably couldn't make it down safely. But what she didn't expect is one of her babies would accidentally fall all the way down. And now she's like, we're going for it. Slowly and safely walking down as one of her brave ones following, with a large group still up top, so scared to go. Until one of them goes for it, but backs out, and then the other one falls right behind them. And now, one by one, they all start and make the gug to fall down to the water. And it's hilarious. And even though they all might have a concussion, they eventually all made it down to their mom. As this bird is just under the tree watching, wondering how many kids this duck has. But finally, this is them at the end, all together swimming down the stream as one big family. When their dog goes out into the water to swim, he really only does this for one reason, and that's so he can then go back to chase his owner, looking to shake the water off on him, calculating the perfect time to do it to get him wet. Just proof that dogs really do this to us on purpose. Go, go, go! Go, go! Get away! Haha, come on, man. Come on. Seriously, come on. He didn't. Acted like he was leaving, but then faked him out going back to hit him with more water. No, man, no. Then went back to get some more.

Without looking back, she walked straight to the cow pen. It seemed like it was the only place where she could get closer to her dreams. But when she tried singing, her voice was so awful that it made a goose start honking wildly.

The elderly woman explained that she'd been mending clothes since she was 15. Even though she wasn't a professional tailor, she'd been working with needle and thread for decades. But the boss said her ideas were too old fashioned and had her assistant show the woman a piece of fabric their employees had fixed. The old woman was totally shocked when she saw it.

Seizing the chance, the elven captain struck first. With a swift spinning kick, he sent an orc flying across the pit. The others, seeing hope, joined the fight instantly. Under the scorching sun, the orcs grew weaker and weaker, their skin sizzling in the light. The slaves quickly gathered their chains, trying desperately to break free. But more orcs rushed out from the tents, roaring in rage to stop their escape. In a moment of life or death, they finally shattered the shackles. But before they could climb to freedom, axes came crashing down. One of them was dragged screaming back into the tent. Seeing this, the others didn't dare hesitate. They grabbed the chains tight.

I laughed at her. Ask someone else. Your body hasn't rejected an organ in 15 years. Anyway, I went to hang up, but she quickly spoke. It's not for me, her voice cracked. It's for my son. He's 9. Please. I felt bad for maybe four seconds. Then I remembered who I was talking to, Celeste. I'm sorry about your kid, but no, I'm not doing that. She hung up. An hour later, someone knocked on my door. It was Celeste and my brother Lennox was with her. We need to talk, Lennox said, pushing past me into my apartment. Celeste followed crying. Lennox, what are you doing here, I asked. Helping someone who actually needs help, he shot back. They spent the next hour tag teaming me. Celeste crying about her dying son, Lennox calling me a heartless coward. Every time I asked why he was here, he diverted the subject to me being selfish. Finally, after a million knows, Celeste looked me dead in the eye and said, you're going to donate whether you like it or not. Over the next week, they kept ambushing me together. I'd be eating lunch and suddenly Lennox and Celeste would be there causing a riot in the restaurant and yelling that I was happy to kill a child, loud enough for everyone to judge me. Then Celeste took it further. She showed Up at my office while I was on a zoom call with the CEO with the kid beside her, a pale, thin 9 year old in a hospital mask. My boss was talking about a promotion when she walked him right up to my desk. This is the man who can save your life, she told the kid loud enough for everyone to hear. The kid looked at me with huge eyes, are you going to save me? My boss stopped speaking, staring at Celeste who had her phone out filming. I felt my face burning. Celeste, this isn't fair. What's not fair is letting a child die, she said. Still filming, she turned to the CEO. Your worker is choosing to let a child pass away. My boss hung up shortly and the rumor spread like wildfire. That night, Lennox showed up at my apartment with papers, legal documents. I talked to a lawyer, he said, spreading them on my kitchen counter. You can be sued for failure to render aid to a minor. You could face charges. I picked up the papers. They looked official, court letterhead, legal language, the whole thing. Just sign the consent form, Lennox said, or deal with this in court. I told him to get out. The next morning, I was researching these documents when Lennox texted me, good luck. Before I could even respond, my doorbell rang.

Just want To know where you are for safety. She practically skipped to bed. I waited until she was asleep, then found Trevor's address in their text chain.

Two weeks later, he texted, you've been cut out. I just said okay. The next day, I met with a lawyer and his smile disappeared in court. Dad died on a Tuesday. By Friday, my brother Noah was already spinning his narrative. At the funeral reception, I overheard him telling our Uncle Nathan's been liquidating assets behind my back. I didn't interrupt. I just kept pouring coffee for grieving relatives. Noah had always been the golden child, charismatic, spontaneous, everyone's favorite. I was the boring accountant who spent holidays reviewing Dad's medical bills while Noah entertained everyone with stories about startup ventures that never materialized. The whispers started immediately. Dad's neighbor gave me cold stares. My cousin unfriended me on Facebook. No. Noah's wife posted about family betrayal that got over 100 sympathetic comments. I didn't respond to any of it. Two weeks after the funeral, Noah texted, family meeting tomorrow, Mom's house. Be there. I showed up. The living room was packed. Mom, aunts, uncles, cousins, even Noah's in laws. Noah stood at the center like a prosecutor. We've all discussed it. Your actions have been unforgivable. You manipulated dad, stole from the estate and betrayed this family. Effective immediately, you're cut out. No inheritance, no family events, nothing. Mom wouldn't look at me. I scanned the room slowly, taking in each face that had convicted me without a single question. Okay, I said quietly. Just okay. Noah blinked, clearly expecting an outburst. His smile wavered, then returned triumphant. That's it. No explanation? Nope, I replied. Standing up. If that's what you decided, then okay. I walked out to stunned silence. Next morning, I called dad to State Attorney Gerald Morrison. Mr Morrison, I need to schedule a meeting. It's time. His voice was steady. I was wondering when you'd call. I'll see you at 2. In his office, Gerald slid a thick folder across his desk. Your father was very clear about his wishes, Nathan. I nodded, already knowing what was inside. Noah doesn't know, does he? Gerald's expression was grim. He never asked, just assumed. Three weeks later, the court hearing. Noah arrived confident, surrounded by family members who'd signed affidavits supporting his claims. They built an entire case on assumptions and lies. When I walked in alone, Noah smirked at his lawyer. Gerald Morrison entered last.

Finally, she looked up, eyes red and swollen. Laxatives, she whispered. Strong laxatives. Just enough that Kira would get sick before her swimming competition. She broke down crying. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What was I thinking? I placed my hand on her shoulder. I should have been furious, but I felt sadness more than anger. Why? Allison looked at me with tear filled eyes. Mom praises Kira constantly and tears Quinn down. Just like when we were kids. You were always praised. I was always criticized. Her voice grew stronger. Every Celebration of Kira's success highlights Quinn's failures. Just once, I wanted her to experience setback too. I was speechless. I never realized Allison's pain had grown this deep.

But when you said Quinn ate them, I panicked. What kind of terrible mother am I? I took her hand. It was cold and shaking. Allison, how is Quinn? Really? He's suffering, she said. At school they call Him, the failure. Teachers say, your cousin is so excellent. At home, mom says, why can't you be like Kira? My chest tightened. I'd never wanted to acknowledge how Kira's success affected when. I'm partly responsible, I admitted. I've ignored this for years. We sat in silence. Two sisters facing a truth we buried for decades. I stood up and took the container, walked to the trash and threw the cookies away. How can you forgive what I tried to do? Allison asked for forgiveness. May not come immediately, I said, but I can try to understand. I pulled out my phone. We need to have a serious talk with mom about how her comparisons affect the children. Allison looked anxious. Do you think she'll listen? I don't know. But change won't happen without trying. Six months later, Quinn found his talent in photography. Sometimes it takes something bitter to reveal what's been poisoning you all along.

Two weeks ago, I come home from soccer practice and my dad is sitting on my bed holding my laptop open. He's not yelling, just staring at the screen with this look I've never seen before. I freeze because I know exactly what he found. My YouTube channel. For 8 months I've been making comedy videos after school, just me doing impressions of teachers and sketch just about classes. Nothing insane. But I got to 50,000 subscribers and brands were messaging me about sponsorships worth $5,000. I never told my parents because my dad always goes on these rants about how Youtubers are lazy and don't contribute to society. So I kept it secret and said I was studying at the library. Finally looks up at me and his voice comes out way too calm. This is what you've been doing. People from my office have seen these videos. Their kids showed them. I didn't realise kids from school were watching. My dad closes the laptop and stands up. I'm taking this and you're done with whatever this is. I need that for homework though. You have your phone. Use that. He walks out with my laptop. The next few days I try filming on my phone but the quality what is terrible and I can't edit anything. My subscribers start commenting, asking where I went. A brand emails about working together and I have to write back saying I can't that $5,000 would have covered my first year of college textbooks. Then my dad starts getting worse. He shows up to my soccer games but doesn't watch, just sits in his car to make sure I'm actually there. Every night he takes my phone and goes through my messages, my photos, my search history. One night I hear my parents arguing. My mom says he's being too hard on me. He tells her I need discipline or I'll turn into one of those internet people who never amount to anything. Six days after he took my laptop, he comes home from work early and his face is bright red. He's gripping his phone so tight his hand is shaking. He storms to my room where I'm doing algebra homework. You're still making videos. I'm confused because I haven't posted anything. He shoves his phone in my face and it's playing a video, but it's not mine. Some other person made a reaction video to my old content and they're doing impressions of my dad using clips from my videos where I joked about his strict rules. The video has 2 million views, way more than any of mine ever got. The comments are brutal. People calling my dad a control freak and making memes. I swear I didn't make that. I tell him someone else took my stuff. He doesn't believe me, starts yelling that I'm trying to destroy his reputation.

Your parents are co signers, not co owners. They have zero ownership rights. This notice is worthless. I had her draft a formal response, but I didn't send it yet. Instead, I did some digging. Turns out Henry had been borrowing heavily from mom and dad to fund his lifestyle. The wedding alone was costing $45,000, most of it fronted by our parents. Ashley's Instagram perfect life was built entirely on credit cards, maxed to $78,000. They were drowning and saw my house as their life raft. I waited, I played along. I even helped plan the wedding, volunteering to coordinate vendors since I was supposedly moving out anyway. Two weeks before the wedding, I made my move. I sent the legal response to my parents, copied to Henry and Ashley, clearly stated they had no ownership claim and the eviction notice was invalid. But that was just the opening act. I called every vendor, the photographer, the caterer, the florist, the venue. Hi, this is Ryan Mitchell calling about the Henry Mitchell wedding. I need to inform you that all payments made on credit card ending in 4, 7, 8, 2 need to be reversed. The card was reported stolen. It wasn't stolen. It was my parents card, which they'd added me as an authorized user on years ago for emergencies. I never removed myself. Technically, I had every right to dispute charges I didn't authorize. By Monday, every vendor had canceled The venue called my parents directly about the bounce deposit, the florist, the DJ, the caterer, everyone. My phone exploded with calls. I didn't answer. Henry showed up at my door three days before the wedding, desperate. You destroyed everything. Ashley's parents won't help. We have no venue, no photographer, nothing. I opened the door wider. That's terrible. Hey, wasn't there something about me needing to move out? How's that going? His face crumbled. Please, we'll drop it. Just fix this. No, I said simply, you wanted my house. I want you to understand what it feels like to lose something that matters. The wedding happened in my parents backyard. No photographer, grocery store cake, 20 people instead of 200. I drove by that day, saw Ashley crying in her discount dress, saw Henry's hollow eyes, saw my mother's face. Finally understand what they'd done. I never moved out. My house, my rules, and I've never felt more at home.

When I opened it, I found a notice telling me to move out of my own house. I smiled and a few months later returned the favor at their wedding. My 30th birthday started like any other family gathering. Mom insisted on hosting at my place because, quote, your house has the best space for everyone. I should have seen it coming. My younger brother Henry and his fiance Ashley showed up first, followed by my parents and extended family. Everyone seemed weirdly excited, exchanging knowing glances. Then came the moment before Cake. Mom announced, we have a very special gift for you, sweetheart. Ashley handed me an elegantly wrapped box with a bow. The room went silent as I untied the ribbon. Inside was a single envelope. No card, no note, just legal paperwork, 60 day notice to vacate my own house. I looked up slowly. Henry was grinning. Surprise, we bought your house. What? I said, still processing. Well, technically, we made an offer to mom and dad. Ashley chimed in. Since they co signed your mortgage five years ago, they're technically co owners. They agreed to sell us their share, which gives us majority ownership. So legally you're the tenant now. My mother smiled sweetly. We. this would be perfect for Henry and Ashley to start their marriage. You're always traveling for work anyway. You don't really need all this space. This is my house. I said quietly, I've paid every single mortgage payment for five years. Dad shrugged, but we're on the deed. That makes it partly ours. We're just exercising our rights. Henry leaned back smug. Don't make this dramatic, Ryan. Ashley and I need a real home for our future kids. You're single. You can rent somewhere smaller. The rage inside me was volcanic, but something else took over, cold calculation. I smiled. Wow, this is incredibly thoughtful. Everyone relaxed, interpreting my calm as acceptance. See, mom said, I knew you'd understand once you thought about it. I nodded, slowly setting the notice down. When's the wedding again? June 15th, Ashley said proudly at the Botanical Gardens. It's going to be magical. Can't wait, I replied, still smiling. That night, I called my real estate lawyer.

The finding out was biblical. I show up to practice Thursday night at the regular time, and my three bandmates are sitting in a circle without their instruments, like they're about to hold an intervention. Lead singer says, we need to talk about the band's future. Battle of bands is in 10 days, and apparently we need to level up our image. That's when I know it's the drummer's girlfriend standing in the corner holding a bass. My bass, actually, that I let him borrow last week. She's holding it upside down. Lead singer looks at me. Look, you're great and all, but she has the look we need. She's been learning bass for, like, two months. Two months? I've been carrying this band for three years. But sure, let's get the girl who thinks a bass has six strings. They vote 3 to 1 to replace me right there with me watching like I'm getting voted off a reality show. The guitarist, who still can't play an F chord cleanly, actually says, it's nothing personal. Nobody's looking at the bassist anyway. Might as well have someone pretty back there. Nobody's looking at the bassist. I wrote half our songs, but okay, Brad, tell me more about how music works. The drummer's girlfriend tries to be nice. You can still come to the show if you want to support us. Support them. Sure. Let me buy a ticket to watch you play my bass badly. Sounds like a Dream Friday night. I don't argue, don't yell. Just say okay if that's what you all want. The lead singer seems surprised I'm not fighting back. Probably expected tears. Sorry to disappoint. They're already talking about keeping the band name and the set list for battle of bands. Acting like everything's normal. Planning tomorrow's practice like I was never even there. Like I'm already a ghost. Guitarist mentions they'll see me around and I just nod, give them a smile that doesn't reach my eyes, walk out quietly. I can hear them talking about stage positions as the door closes. How she'll look right in the back, how the judges will love having something nice to look at. They think this is over. They think I'm just going to crawl away and cry. That's cute. I'm sitting in my car in the driveway and my brain starts doing math. Tomorrow's practice. They kept saying see you at practice tomorrow to each other. But wait, that's my amp the guitarist uses because his sounds like a dying cat. My mixing board that makes our lead singer not sound like he's through a kazoo. The mic system I bought with birthday money. The cables, the stands, hell, even the extension cords are mine. I check the battle of bands registration on my phone. The song list they submitted. Breaking Chains I wrote that. Midnight Drive wrote that in my bedroom. Phoenix Rising? That's literally about my ex boyfriend. I have the notebooks. With the original lyrics in my handwriting. The van we use for gigs. Mine. Well, technically my mom's, but she lets me use it. And then it hits me. This is my dad's garage. Dad only lets them practice here because of me. I text him, hey, the band just kicked me out for not being pretty enough. He texts back immediately. Are you kidding me? They're banned. I'll change the garage code right now. My dad's the best. They kept saying, see you at practice tomorrow. They actually think they're still practicing here tomorrow. In my dad's garage. With my equipment, playing my songs. The delusion is actually impressive. Next day, five PM, I'm home.

Kyle blocked the door. She doesn't want you here. Security had to remove him. My daughter Emma was born 4 pounds, spent three weeks in NICU. I was there every day. Sarah and Kyle showed up twice. I overheard Kyle saying once she's home and healthy, we can get back to normal. Like my daughter was an inconvenience. I won primary custody. Sarah got supervised visitation she rarely used. Two years passed. I focused on Emma, my career rebuilding. Then dad called your mother and I updated our will. Kyle's getting the house and business. You've always been self sufficient. I stopped going to family events. Emma and I built our own traditions. Last month, dad had a massive stroke. Mom followed two weeks later. The will reading was brutal. Kyle showed up in a new BMW, Sarah on his arm, already spending money they didn't have. The lawyer read the will. My parents had changed it three weeks before Dad's stroke. Everything to me, the house, the business, stocks, life insurance, nearly $2 million total. Kyle's face went purple. There was a letter attached. We watched Kyle destroy Nathan's life for our approval. We enabled his cruelty. We rejected our grandson. We were wrong about everything. Kyle exploded. This is fraud. He was wrong. The lawyer had medical evaluations proving they were completely lucid. Within a week, Kyle's life collapsed. The BMW was repossessed. Sarah left him. He lost the guest house. When I sold It yesterday, he showed up at my door, hollow eyed and desperate. I need help. I'm your brother. I looked at him and saw the man who'd slept with my wife, stolen my chance at being present for my daughter's birth and laughed while doing it. You're right, I said. You are my brother. That's why this hurts so much. I'll give you one thing, the number for the same therapist I used to process what you all put me through. The rest you figure out yourself. I closed the door. Emma called from her room asking who it was. Just someone who used to be important, I told her, but not anymore. Some bridges don't deserve rebuilding.

I want a divorce, she said, not quite meeting my eyes. I nodded slowly, okay, I'll have my lawyer contact yours. Her face lit up, not with sadness, with relief. She even let a small smile slip. That's when I knew I'd made the right call. Her lawyer sent the initial filing three days later. The demands were breathtaking. Half of everything, including my business, spousal support for five years, the house, even my grandfather's inheritance that she'd never been entitled to. My lawyer's response was a work of art, 47 pages detailing every asset move I'd made, every legal justification, every time stamp proving these were legitimate business decisions made before any divorce filing. We attached the photos of her notebook, the calculations, the planning. Most devastating was the evidence of her affair, because once I started looking, I found it. Hotel charges on a credit card I'd forgotten she had access to. Text messages with someone named David, her personal trainer, David, the one she'd been seeing three times a week for six months. Her lawyer called mine within 24 hours. We need to talk. Sophie showed up at the house that night, mascara running. You moved everything. You planned this. No, I said calmly. You planned this. I just protected myself. She started crying, real tears. This time I made A mistake? Can we work this out? Maybe counseling? I showed her the text messages with David, the hotel receipts. Was this a mistake, too? Her face went pale. The final settlement was nothing like her original demands. No business stake, no inheritance, no spousal support, just an even split of actual marital assets. And she had to cover her own legal fees. Last week, she sent me a long email about how I manipulated everything, how I planned this from the beginning, how I was vindictive and cruel. I read it once, then deleted it. She was right about one thing, though. I did plan it just two weeks before she filed. But that was enough. In the end, her biggest mistake wasn't the affair. It was leaving that notebook where I could find.

Never held a job longer than six months. Growing up, he was the golden child while I was invisible. When I got into medical school, my parents said it was expected. When Kyle got a participation trophy, they threw a party. I met Sarah during residency. We married young, built what I believed was a solid life. Kyle lived in our guest house rent free because he was between opportunities. That's what mom always called his constant unemployment. Things felt off for months. Sarah working late. Kyle suddenly motivated to help around the house when I wasn't home. Then came my 35th birthday dinner at my parents house. I walked in early and found them, my wife, my brother, in my childhood bedroom. Kyle laughed. Dude, chill. It just happened. My parents rushed in. Mom's first words, don't overreact, Nathan. These things are complicated. Dad pulled me aside. Your brothers finally found happiness. Maybe this is good for everyone.

Sarah's pregnant and you're going to deny your brother his chance at being a father? That's when it hit Me pregnant. We've been trying for two years with no success. Sarah blamed stress, but Kyle had only been in the picture for four months. I demanded a paternity test. Kyle refused. Sarah cried about trust. My parents called me paranoid. So I made it a condition of the divorce settlement. The results came back mine. The baby was mine. They'd stolen my child before I even knew they existed. Kyle moved Sarah into my parents house. They threw her a baby shower, bought everything. I wasn't invited. I watched on social media while my family celebrated my wife carrying my baby with my brother playing dad. Sarah went into premature labor at 32 weeks.

My wife, Sophie, had suddenly become obsessed with our finances. After 11 years of marriage, where she couldn't care less about bank statements, she was suddenly asking detailed questions about my investments, my retirement accounts, even my late grandfather's inheritance. The breaking point came when I found a notebook hidden in her car, pages of handwritten calculations, asset divisions, property evaluations, my business worth. The bottom of one page in her handwriting, community, property, state, 50% minimum, more with good lawyer. My hands were shaking when I photographed every page and put it back exactly where I found it. That night at dinner, Sophie smiled at me like nothing was wrong. How was your day, honey? All I could think about was that notebook, the calculations, the cold surgical way she'd written out how to take half of everything I'd spent 15 years building. I didn't confront her. I did something smarter. The next morning, I called my old college roommate, Marcus, now a divorce attorney in another state. I need advice and I need it quiet. Within 48 hours, I had a legal strategy. Every move carefully documented, every step defensible. I started with the business, my software company that I'd founded before we even met. I restructured it, making It clear that assets pre dating the marriage were separate property. I quietly moved my grandfather's inheritance into a separate trust, exactly as his will had originally specified. All perfectly legal, all documented with time stamps and legal justifications. Joint accounts were trickier. I couldn't just drain them. That would look bad in court. Instead, I methodically documented every expense, every time Sophie bought designer handbags with my earnings, every spa weekend, every girl's trip to Cabo. I wasn't being petty. I was building a case. Two weeks after I found that notebook, Sophie came home looking nervous. She.

Vincent stands up, his chair scraping loudly. This is ridiculous. Chloe, don't listen to this. Sit down. Mom's voice cuts through the room. He sits. I swipe again. Here's the pawn shop receipt for Grandma's engagement ring. The one that went missing in 2013. You blamed me for that, too, remember? Said I probably sold it for drug money. I turned the phone toward Mom. Vincent's signature, April 2,013. On for $800. My cousin Jordan whispers, holy shit. Vincent's face is red now. That's not my signature. Anyone could have forged that. The pawn shop had security footage, too, but they only keep it for seven years. Uncle Mitchell is staring at Vincent with this look of pure disgust. You son of a. Wait. I interrupt. There's more. I swipe to the next photo. This is the insurance claim Vincent filed in 2014 for a break in that never happened. Claimed $12,000 in stolen electronics and jewelry. Mom's hands are shaking. We split that money. You said we needed it for the roof repair, right? I say, except I pulled the insurance investigation report. They suspected fraud, but couldn't prove it. The serial numbers Vincent provided, they didn't match any purchase items. He made them up. Vincent's already moving toward the door, but Devon's blocking the exit. My husband's sick, 6 foot 3 and played college football. And this? I show her. The final photo is the police report I filed last month. Statute Of limitations just expired for prosecution. But insurance fraud doesn't expire for civil suits. I'm suing him for the $12,000 plus interest. The insurance company is joining the suit, too. Mom looks at Vincent. He's ail sweating, eyes darting toward the exit. She stands up slowly. Get out, Diane, let me explain. Get out! He practically runs from the restaurant. The table erupts in chaos. Uncle Mitchell's yelling. Aunt Rachel's crying. My cousins are all talking at once. Mom walks around the table and wraps her arms around me. She's sobbing into my shoulder. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I invited him tonight so she could finally see who he really was. Mom filed for divorce three days later.

I set my fork down, smiled and said, that's exactly why I invited him tonight. Growing up in Portland, my stepdad, Vincent, controlled everything, the thermostat, the grocery list, who mom talked to on the phone. When I was 16, he convinced mom to kick me out, saying I was stealing from them. I wasn't, but mom believed him and I spent my senior year couch surfing between friends houses, finishing school while working at a gas station. Vincent had this way of making everything seem reasonable. Chloe's been acting different. He'd tell mom money's going missing, I found empty boxes in her room. All lies. But he was patient. He built the story slowly over months until mom had no choice but to believe him. I tried explaining, showed her my bank statements, my work schedule, everything. But Vincent was already three steps ahead. He planted evidence, twisted conversations, made me look unstable for even defending myself. The night mom told me to leave, Vincent stood behind her with this satisfied smirk I'll never forget. Fast forward 12 years. I'm a physical therapist now married to Devon. Able life in Seattle. Mom's been trying to reconcile for the past two years. Sunday phone calls, holiday texts, the whole routine. But Vincent's still in the picture, still playing victim about how I abandoned the family and broke Mom's heart. Tonight at Mom's 60th birthday dinner at this Italian place downtown, my Uncle Mitchell doesn't know Vincent sitting three seats down when he makes that comment. I'd specifically arranged the seating so they be separated by other family members. The table goes completely silent, 15 people, mid bite, frozen. Vincent's fork clatters against his plate. I've been preparing for this moment for months. I pull out my phone, open my photos. Mom, remember when Vincent said I stole $3,000 from you guys, that's why you kicked me out? She nodded slowly, her wine glass halfway to her lips. I swiped to a bank statement from 2,012. This shows Vincent withdrew that exact amount from your joint account the same week. So Tember 14th, 2,012. Then blamed me three days later. Mom's face drains of color. She sets down her glass. My Aunt Rachel leans in to look. Is that real? Bank of America confirmed it last month. I say I request.

I know that sounds weird coming from a white girl, but hear me out. This whole thing started about three years ago when I was living in Atlanta for my internship. My usual salon back home was, like, four hours away, and I was desperate for a trim because my hair looked like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. My roommate Keisha, was getting ready to head out to her salon and saw me struggling with my massive curls in the bathroom mirror. She just laughed and said, girl, come with me. My stylist will sort you out. I was hesitant because I'd never been to a black salon before, but honestly, my hair was so bad, I would have tried anything. Walking into that salon was like entering a whole different world. The energy was incredible. Everyone was talking, laughing, music playing, kids running around while their moms got their hair done. It felt alive in a way that the quiet, sterile salons I was used to never did. The stylist, Miss Janet, took one look at my hair and shook her head, baby, who's been cutting your hair? Because they need to stop. She started running her fingers through it, asking me about my routine, what products I used, how I dried it. Nobody had ever asked me those questions before. They just wet it, cut it, and send me on my way. Miss Janet spent two hours on my hair. Two hours. He deep conditioned it, trimmed each curl individually, showed me how to scrunch it properly, and sent me home with specific instructions about what products to use and how often to wash it. My hair looked better than it ever had in my entire life. But here's the thing that really got me. She charged me $40. 40. The salon back home charged

That afternoon, I tried joining him on the track during pe, thinking we could maybe jog and chat together. But the moment he saw me coming, he just sprinted away like I was chasing him down with a machete. For the next few days, it went on like that between us. But here's the thing, the more I annoyed him, the more I started noticing small changes. How on the fourth day of me walking home behind him, he slowed down just enough that I could actually keep up. And when I sat across from him at lunch, he stayed and ate with his headphones in while I rambled about my day. Two weeks in, he finally cracked. When I tripped and fell onto the track, he stopped and bent down to carry me to the side of the grass and asked, what do you want from me? I felt my heart race hearing his voice. I just want to be friends with you, I said simply. He stared at me before letting out a sad laugh. You're crazy, maybe, I shrugged, but you're stuck with me now. Then something crazy happened after that. Whenever I'd walk over to him, he pulled down his headphones and actually chat with me. And slowly I started seeing glimpses of the old Ian The one who'd make sarcastic comments that'd make me laugh so hard I'd snort. The one who'd hold the door open with, without thinking about it. The one whose smile melted everyone in the room. He even started changing at school, talking to others without that edge in his voice. And I felt proud thinking I actually managed to pull him from the dark place like he once did for me. But then he saw it. We were hanging out at the bookstore when Ian reached into my bag for a pen and froze. His jaw tightened as he slowly pulled out the notebook. Why do you have this? He asked quietly. My mouth went dry. I was going to give it back, but he stood up abruptly, the chair scraping loud against the floor. You read it, didn't you? That's why you've been doing all this. I thought you cared, but this was all just some pity party to you. I do care. I stood up, too. My voice louder than I meant it to be. It's started with a notebook, but that's not why I stayed. I took a deep breath. I stayed because I fell in love with you. The words hung in the air between us. His eyes widened, anger melting. He sank back into the chair, the notebook still in his hands. This isn't my notebook. And what he said next made everything click into place. The reason why he became closed off and honestly, It broke my heart more than his answer to my confession.

I was born completely deaf and got my first cochlear implant when I turned 16. My parents had been pushing for it since I was little, but I kept refusing because I was perfectly happy in my silent world. The day they activated my implant was like stepping into an alien universe. Suddenly everything had sound, and I mean everything. The audiologist warned me it would be overwhelming, but nothing could have prepared me for the chaos. The first shot came when I walked to the bathroom after my appointment. I sat down to pee and heard this loud rushing water sound. I jumped up thinking something was broken. My mom had to explain through tears of laughter that peeing makes noise. For 16 years, I thought it was completely silent. But that was just the beginning of my sound discoveries. Walking became this weird symphony. Every footstep made noise on different surfaces, carpet with soft thumps, hardwood with sharp clicks. And don't get me started, on gravel. I spent 20 minutes just walking back and forth on our driveway, amazed that each step sounded like tiny explosions. Eating was absolutely disgusting. I had no idea chewing was so loud and gross. That first dinner, I kept asking my family if they could hear my mouth making all these wet, crunching sounds. They said yes, but you just Learned to ignore it. How do hearing people eat without being grossed out constantly? My cat Oliver became this whole different creature. Apparently, he'd been meowing at me for years and I never knew. The first time I heard him, I thought there was a baby crying somewhere. He also purrs, which sounds like a tiny motor running. Plus, his footsteps on hardwood sound like little tap dancers. The biggest shock came during my first night sleeping with the implant. I kept hearing this rhythmic thumping sound that scared me. I woke up my parents thinking someone was in the house. Dad checked everywhere before realising I was hearing my own heartbeat through the pillow. Nobody told me hearts make noise. School became a nightmare of new sounds. Pencils scratching on paper sounded like nails on chalkboards. Kids clicking pens drove me absolutely crazy. The worst was when people cracked their knuckles. I literally screamed the first time my friend Jake did it, thinking he broke something. But the most embarrassing discovery happened during lunch. I was eating an apple when this girl named Tessa sitting nearby started laughing. I asked what was funny and she said I was eating really loudly. Apparently biting and chewing apples sounds like someone stomping on bubble wrap. I've been crunching away completely unaware that everyone could hear me. The weirdest thing was learning that some of my habits were actually really annoying. I used to tap my fingers on desks when I was thinking. Turns out that Makes noise and had been driving my teachers crazy for years. They just never said anything because they knew I couldn't hear it.

But she wasn't laughing when I took her literally. I've been married to Lisa for five years. I'm an engineer making 78 k. She's a nurse practitioner making 82 k. Always pulled our money together into joint accounts. Last month, Lisa comes home from her girls night all excited. Babe Sarah and Jen both have separate finances with their husbands. We're both doing so well financially. What if we each just handle our own expenses? More independence, you know, more modern. Honestly, it sounded reasonable. We're both adults making decent money. Why not? Sure, let's split everything, 50, 50, rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, everything. She seemed a bit surprised by how specific I was getting. Well, I meant more like we each pay for our own stuff. You handle the bills you want, I handle mine. More flexible, red flag, but I agreed anyway. Maybe she had a point about flexibility. So the next day I sat down with our budget and divided everything perfectly down the middle. Rent one, $400 each. You abilities, $150 each. Internet, $50 each. Groceries, $400 each. Insurance, $200 each. Car payments, gas, personal expenses, all separate. I made a nice little spreadsheet and showed her. She said, wow, okay, very thorough, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Here's what I didn't expect. Lisa is absolutely terrible with money, always has been. I just never noticed because I've been handling all our finances. For five years, I never had to budget or track expenses. Week 2, hey babe, can you cover utilities this month? I bought this amazing Korean skincare set that was on sale. I'll pay you back next week. Week 3, my half of rent is gonna be a few days late. Had to get my car detailed and got those highlights I've been wanting. You don't mind covering me, right?

When I found out my classmate plan to take his own life, I decided to help him in the way everyone warned me not to. Ian used to be the guy everyone wanted to hang out with, the type to help freshman with algebra, then turn around and throw spirals with the seniors. The type to sit with the quiet kids because he never wanted anyone to be alone. He never cared that no one asked how he was doing. He just focused on making others happy. But last year, he changed abruptly. He stopped smiling, started getting into fights over nothing. So like everyone else, I kept my distance until he left his notebook in Class 1 Thursday afternoon. I was about to hand it over to the teacher when it fell open. The moment my eyes read what was on the page, it was too late. The handwriting was messy and desperate and the small wrinkled spots were clearly tear stains. It was the words that made my hands shake uncontrollably. I can't do this anymore. Everything hurts too much. I'm so sorry. I felt my breath stuck in my throat. There were pages and pages talking about giving up, about how it'd be easier if everything just stopped. And I wasn't sure what to do. So I went to my friends for Help. My best friend Rica closed the notebook shut and shook her head at me. Look, I know this is bad, but please don't get involved with him. He literally got suspended last semester when he fought one of his old friends and you're practically a stranger to him, she advised. But Ian helped me once. Remember three years ago when I had a panic attack during my presentation? He sat down with me in the hallway and stayed with me until I was done crying. I insist. Ricca let out a sigh while my other friend Maddie forced to smile. We know you'll do it anyway. Just promise you'll walk away if things go south. Okay? I immediately found Ian after school walking toward the parking lot with his hood up and headphones. I chased after him, basically jogging just to keep up. Hey, wait up, let's walk home together. He glanced down at me, but when I grinned at him, he gave an annoyed look and walked faster towards his house. I chased after him anyway, rambling about the weather and homework and literally anything that came to mind. When he turned on his street, I stopped and waved and yelled, see you tomorrow as loud as I could, but he never responded. The next day at lunch, I sat down across from him with my tray and smiled. He stared at me for exactly three seconds before.

They didn't come to my middle school graduation, didn't come to my high school graduation. My aunt was there for everything, cheering louder than any parent in that auditorium. When I left for college at 18, my parents didn't help with tuition, didn't help me move into my dorm. I don't think they even knew which university I attended. My aunt covered everything. Last year, Grandpa got sick, really sick. He kept asking to see his sons. My dad and uncles, aunt called them repeatedly, begging them to visit. None of them came. My aunt moved into his farmhouse to take care of him in his final months. I drove out every weekend to help. When Grandpa died, my dad and uncle suddenly appeared at the funeral, then at the lawyer's office for the will reading. Grandpa left everything to my aunt, his 150 acre farm, the farmhouse and $1 million in cash. The rest went to charity. My dad's face went white. Three weeks later, my aunt called me over. She handed me a check for the full million, said Grandpa would have wanted me to have it, that I'd spent more time with him than any of his actual sons. She told me to start the business I'd always dreamed about. I cried, not because of the money, but because someone actually cared about my dreams. Word got out fast. Within days, my phone started blowing up. Dad suddenly remembered my number. Hey, buddy, how's School. We should catch up. Mom left voicemails about how much she missed me, how proud she was of me going to college. Yesterday, dad showed up at my dorm. I have no idea how he got my address. Probably called my aunt. He stood there smiling, saying how proud he was that I was graduating this year. Asked why I never visited his house anymore. I asked him when he last called me. He went quiet, then laughed it off. You're still mad about the divorce? Come on. That was years ago. We both love you. Your mom misses you. Let me drive you home for dinner. I told him the only family I have is my aunt, that he abandoned me 9 years ago and I wasn't stupid enough have to fall for this. I know why you're here. That million brought you back, right? He put his hands up, said he had no ulterior motives, just wanted to apologize and have me back in his life. Mentioned he heard my graduation was coming up, wanted to make sure he got an invitation this time. That same night, mom left another voicemail, said she and dad couldn't afford college themselves, so they always dreamed I'd go. She's so excited I'm graduating, wants to be there for my big day. They think I'm stupid. They think 9 years of silence can be erased with a few phone calls and fake tears. My graduation is in two weeks. I'm not Inviting either of them.

After her family voted me out, I just nodded. The next morning, their own lawyer called her, his voice shaking. The vote, it didn't remove him. It just triggered Article 11, section B. God help us all. So this happened last week, and I'm still processing everything. I'm 54. Built my tech company from nothing. Literally started in my garage with a broken laptop and a dream. Fast forward 28 years, and we're worth $180 million. Along the way, I married Sarah, 32. Yeah, I know what you're thinking, but she seemed genuine back then. The board meeting started normal enough. Sarah, her brother Kyle, my C F O, and six other executives, most of them Sarah's relatives I'd hired over the years. The kind of people who smile at Thanksgiving, check their inheritance behind your back. Sarah stood up first. We've called this vote because leadership needs fresh direction. Her voice was cold. Kyle nodded like a bobblehead. The others wouldn't even look at me. Then came the vote. One by one, hands went up. My own wife voted against me. Seven to one. I was out. Sarah leaned across the table, her new diamond bracelet catching the light. You're not man enough to fight for the company you built, she said, loud enough for everyone to hear, like she'd practiced it. The room went dead silent. Kyle smirked. Jerry from accounting, the guy Whose student loans I'd paid off. Just stared at his coffee. You know what I did? I nodded once, and I stood up, straighten my jacket, and walked out. No yelling, no drama. Just the sound of my shoes on the floor. Sarah looked confused. She wanted to fight. She wanted me to beg. Instead, she got silence. I walked straight to my office, the one they hadn't touched yet. Behind a fake panel I'd installed 28 years ago was a brown leather binder. Inside was the original company charter, the one from before Sarah got her first

Asked them to show up at noon with decorations and cake. Told them to keep it secret that she thought I was out of town. They ate it up. Her mom was practically crying with joy. Said I was the most thoughtful son in law ever. Even offered to bring her famous potato salad. I left the house at 9 a m. With my suitcase, just like I said I would. Waved goodbye to her from the driveway. She blew me a kiss from the doorway. Already in her silk robe, the one I bought her for Christmas. I drove around the block and park three streets over, right where I could see our driveway. Waited in my car with a coffee and a breakfast sandwich from the Corner Deli. At 10:47 a m, a silver BM W pulled up. Didn't recognize the car, but I recognized his face immediately from the photos on her burner phone. Her project manager from work, the one she'd been texting I miss you, too. At 2 a m, while I slept next to her, I watched him walk up to my front door. Watched her answer in that same silk robe. Watched her pull him inside and close the door. I sat there for another hour, stomach turning, but I waited. Timing had to be perfect. Perfect. At 11:00am, I met her family outside our building. Her mom was holding a custom cake from the expensive bakery. White frosting with pink Flowers that said, happy 32nd birthday, Taylor. Her sister had a bouquet of balloons. Her best friend carried A bag of presents wrapped in gold paper. Everyone was grinning, so excited to surprise her. I had my key ready. Told everyone to be super quiet, that we'd sneak down the hall and really shock her. They were giggling like kids on Christmas morning. Her mom kept adjusting the candles on the cake. We walked in silent. I could hear music playing from the bedroom, her favorite playlist. Her mom was trying not to laugh. Holding that cake with both. With hands. Her sister kept whispering, she's going to freak out. Her friend was recording on her phone. We made our way down the hall. I positioned everyone right outside the bedroom door. Her mom held up the cake. 32 candles flickering. Everyone raised their party horns, fingers on the triggers. I mouthed one, two, three, and threw open the door. The party horns went off at the exact same moment her mom dropped A cake.

I knew something was off when she started working late every Tuesday. At first I believed her. She's always been dedicated to her career. But then the little things started piling up. She'd come home smelling different. Not perfume exactly, but like someone else's laundry detergent. Her phone was suddenly password protected after eight years of marriage. And she started going to the gym at weird hours. Ten PM on a Wednesday. Really? The breaking point was finding the second phone in her gym bag. I was looking for her water bottle to wash it, and there it was. A cheap prepaid phone, still logged into everything. Messages, photos, tell reservations, all of it. Here's what I Learned in that moment. Don't confront immediately. I wanted to scream. I wanted to throw that phone against the wall and demand answers. But something in me said to wait. Document everything first. So I did. For three months, I played The Perfect Husband. I screenshotted every text on that burner phone when she was in the shower. I saved receipts from hotels I'd never been to, restaurants we'd never eaten at. I tracked her late nights on a calendar, built an air tight case and handed it all to a lawyer. My attorney loved me. Said most guys come in with nothing but suspicion. I came in with a legal nuclear weapon. Her birthday rolled around in October. Three months into My silent investigation. I asked what she wanted to do, and she got this strange look on her face. Said she wanted me to go visit my brother for the weekend. Said she just wanted a quiet day at home. Maybe order takeout and watch movies. Didn't want to be reminded she was getting older. I knew that was complete garbage. He loves her birthday. Last year, she had a party with 40 people. That morning, I found champagne hidden in the garage. The expensive kind. $200 a bottle. Two crystal glasses wrapped in tissue paper, tucked behind the paint cans. Candles, too. The fancy ones from that boutique store downtown. She always dragged me to. Something in me snapped. But not in an angry way. In a calculated way. So I called her mom, then her sister, then her best friend from college, the one who was in our wedding. Told them all the same story. I wanted to throw her a surprise.

My 14 year old daughter started asking to sleep over at friends houses every weekend. And I thought it was just normal teenage social stuff. But then I noticed the pattern. Every Monday morning, she'd come home looking absolutely destroyed. Dark circles so deep they looked like bruises. Shoulders hunched, dragging her feet like each step hurt. When I asked about the sleepovers, she'd just mumble, it was fun and disappear into her room. Her math teacher emailed saying she had a panic attack during class when he'd casually asked about her weekend plans. Her violent teacher called to say she'd quit. Just walked out mid lesson without explanation. She lost 10 pounds in just over a month. Her favourite jeans hung loose on her hips. She barely touched breakfast anymore. Started missing Sunday family dinners, events she'd never miss before. Not even when she had the flu. My partner thought I was losing it. She's 14. Lisa, girls have sleepovers. You're being paranoid. But when I was cleaning her room, I found energy drink cans stuffed behind her dresser. Dozens of them. My sweet girl who used to drink nothing but herbal tea. My mom instincts weren't just whispering anymore. They were screaming. I started watching her more carefully. She'd get text on Friday afternoon and her whole body would change. Shoulders would tense up, face would go pale, hands would start trembling as she packed. Always the same overnight bag. But I Noticed something odd. Work gloves sticking out of the side pocket. No more family game nights on Saturdays. No more baking cookies together on Sunday mornings. No more asking me to braid her hair before bed. It was like she was being pulled away from us by some invisible force. One day, I was passing her room when I heard her on the phone. Her voice was different. Scared. Desperate, almost. I know. I know. I'll be there. Her voice cracked. I can't do this every weekend anymore. Please. A pause. No, I understand. I promise I won't tell anyone. Then I heard her crying. Real gut wrenching sobs that made my chest tighten. The next morning at breakfast, I asked casually, which friend's house are you going to tonight, honey? Her spoon clattered into her cereal bowl. Her eyes darted to her phone like it might save her. Just. Just. Marlene's. Her mom already said yes. But I called Marlene's mom last week. Marlene had been at her dad's house in another state for the past month. That's when I really started noticing her phone behaviour. When a specific notification sound played, just two quick beeps, her entire body would go rigid. Then she'd immediately delete whatever she'd seen. Something was very, very wrong with my daughter. I waited until she left for her sleepover that Saturday night. Then I did something I'd sworn I'd never do. I followed her. She didn't walk like a teenager heading to a Fun sleepover. She walked like someone heading to their execution, taking a weird, winding route through the neighborhood, doubling back twice, constantly checking over her shoulder. At one point she stopped completely, stood under a streetlight, and I watched her take deep, shuddering breaths like she was preparing for battle. She pulled out her phone and typed something. Even from my car, I could see her hands shaking as she hit send. The response must have been immediate because her shoulders slumped into defeat. Then she kept walking. What I discovered made my stomach drop to the floor. She didn't go.

I know that sounds weird coming from a white girl, but hear me out. This whole thing started about three years ago when I was living in Atlanta for my internship. My usual salon back home was like 4 hours away and I was desperate for a trim because my hair looked like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. My roommate Keisha, was getting ready to head out to her salon and saw me struggling with my messy curls in the bathroom mirror. She just laughed and said, girl, come with me. My stylist will sort you out. I was hesitant because I'd never been to a black salon before. But honestly, my hair was so bad I would have tried anything. Walking into that salon was like entering a whole different world. The energy was incredible. Everyone was talking, laughing, music playing, kids running around while their moms got their hair done. It felt alive in a way that the buy it sterile salons I was used to never did. The stylist, Miss Janet, took one look at my hair and shook her head, baby, who's been cutting your hair? Because they need to stop. She started running her fingers through it, asking me about my routine, what products I used, how I dried it. Nobody had ever asked me those questions before. They just wet it, cut it and send me on my way. Miss Janet spent two hours on My hair, two hours. She deep conditioned it, trimmed each curl individually, showed me how to scrunch it properly and sent me home with specific instructions about what products to use and how often to wash it. My hair looked better than it ever had in my entire life. But here's the thing that really got me. She charged me $40. 40. The salon back home charged.

I worked at a rage room for three years, seen all kinds of people, angry, ex wives, screaming teenagers, guys who just got fired. But this one guy, he was different. Walks in Tuesday morning around nine, regular jeans, a hoodie, beat up sneakers, maybe early 30s, looked completely normal. Face was just blank, like someone unplugged him from the world. I need your biggest room, he says. How long? I asked. All day if you let me. I explain we do four hour blocks maximum. Eight hours is our limit. He books two sessions back to back, doesn't even ask the price, just slides his credit card across the counter. Then he pulls out a thick stack of, he pays the whole thing in cash instead. He says, I wanna make sure this happens. What are you bringing to destroy, I ask. Killing out the waiver? Nothing, he says. I'll use whatever you have. So I take him to our storage area in the back. We've got tons of donated stuff people drop off. Old furniture, broken TVs, boxes of dishes, electronics, random junk from estate sales, basically whatever people want gone. He starts walking through it slowly touching things, picking stuff up, setting it back down, runs his fingers over an old dining chair, opens drawers in a beat up dresser, holds up a coffee mug, reads the bottom and puts it down. He does this for Maybe 30 minutes. I'm watching him the whole time thinking this guy's either gonna have the best session ever or he's gonna just stand there. Finally he stops in front of this bright yellow plastic toy box, one of those ones with cartoon characters all over it, pulls it out, carries it to the room, doesn't say a word, closes the door behind him. I go to the security room to watch the camera feed. He sits on the floor cross legged, opens the toy box, starts pulling out toys one by one. A stuffed brown bear with a missing eye, three or four toy cars, those wooden building blocks with letters on them, plastic action figures, a dump truck with one wheel missing. He lines every single one up in front of him in this perfect straight row like he's arranging them for a family photo. Then he picks up the bear and just stares at it. I check the time stamp. Ten minutes go by, he's still holding it. 15 minutes, 20 minutes, he hasn't moved at all, just sitting there looking at this beat up stuff bear. Finally he stands up, places the bear back in the toy box so carefully like he's putting a baby down to sleep, closes the lid gently. Everything else, though, he destroys it all. Picks up a toy car, smashes it with a hammer into dust, grabs the action figures, rips them apart, throws pieces against the wall, takes the wooden Blocks, throws them one by one as hard as he can. The sound is constant, just bang, crash, bang, crash, over and over. He's using hammers, bats, sometimes just his bare hands, grinding plastic into the concrete floor. By the time lunch rolls around, his shirt is soaked through with sweat. But he doesn't stop, doesn't even slow down. Goes back to our storage, grabs these old photo albums. We keep them as filler items from estate sales nobody wants. He carries like six of them back to the room, sits down again, opens the first one, looks at every single picture. Random strangers, weddings, birthdays, kids graduating, people who are probably dead now. He studies each one for maybe five seconds and tears it out, rips it to shreds.

He does this for all six albums. Hundreds and hundreds of photos turned into confetti covering the floor like snow. Then he gets up, grabs more stuff from storage, old laptop computer, smashes it. Trophy from some kids soccer team, bends it in half. Picture frames, glass everywhere. He works for the full eight hours, never stops, never sits down except to look at photos. The noise doesn't stop for more than a few seconds at a time. By the end, the room looks like a tornado hit it. Toys scattered everywhere, shattered glass and paper covering every surface. Pieces of plastic and metal ground into powder. But that bear still sitting perfect and untouched in the yellow toy box like nothing happened around it. When his time is up, he comes out. His hands are bleeding through the gloves, knuckles split open, shirt completely soaked. You okay, I ask. He nods, starts walking toward the exit, gets to the door, stops, turns around. My son died six months ago, he says. Car accident. He was 4 years old. I don't know what to say. Just stand there. Everyone keeps telling me I need to move on. He continue. Get rid of his things, donate his toys, stop living in the past. They say I'm not healing, they say I need closure. He looks back at the destroyed room. I can destroy 1,000 toys, he says, but I can't touch his. I can rip apart 100 teddy bears, but not the one he slept with every night. He walks back to the room, picks up the yellow toy box with the bear are still inside, holds it against his chest. Can I buy this from you, he asks. I tell him it's free. Take it. He looks at me for the first time, really looks at me. Thank you, he says. Leaves carrying that toy box like it's made of glass. Walking real slow like he's afraid he'll drop it. I watched him through the front window, put it in his passenger seat, buckle it in like a person, then drive away. Never saw him again. But I kept that exact spot empty in our storage. After that day, whenever we got toy donations, I'd put them somewhere else just in case he came back. He never did.

But she wasn't laughing when I took her literally. I've been married to Lisa for 5 years. I'm an engineer making 70 eight K. She's a nurse practitioner making 82 K. Always pulled our money together into joint accounts. Last month, Lisa comes home from her girls night all excited. Babe, Sarah and Jen both have separate finances with their husbands. We're both doing so well financially. What if we each just handle our own expenses? More independence, you know, more modern. Honestly, it sounded reasonable. We're both adults making decent money. Why not? Sure, let's split everything. Fifty fifty. Rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, everything. She seemed a bit surprised by how specific I was getting. Well, I meant more like we each pay for our own stuff. You handle the bills you want, I handle mine. More flexible. Red flag. But I agreed anyway. Maybe she had a point about flexibility. So the next day, I sat down with our budget and divided everything perfectly down the middle. Rent one, $400 each. You abilities, $150 each. Internet, $50 each. Groceries, $400 each. Insurance, $200 each. Car payments, gas, personal expenses, all separate. I made a nice little spreadsheet and showed her. She said, wow. Okay. Very thorough, but seemed a little overwhelmed. Here's what I didn't expect. Lisa is absolutely terrible with money. Always has been. I just never noticed because I've been handling all our Finances. For five years, we never had to budget or track expenses. Week 2. Hey, babe, can you cover utilities this month? I bought this amazing Korean skincare set that was on sale. I'll pay you back next week. Week 3. My half of rent is gonna be a few days late. Had to get my car detail failed and got those highlights I've been wanting. You don't mind covering me, right? Week four. Can you grab groceries this week? I'm a little short until payday. Work has been so stressful. I deserve that shopping trip. I started keeping track of every loan in my phone just out of curiosity. Meanwhile, I'm actually thriving without her impulse purchases draining our joint account. I'm in.

I've been hosting every single holiday for my husband Nathan's family for five years straight. We're talking 14 people showing up at my house expecting miracles, while his mom, Linda, parks herself in my kitchen watching me cook like she's Gordon Ramsay. Last month when I was preparing a family dinner, she followed me around the kitchen saying things like, that's not how my mother made gravy, but I guess your mother never taught you anything. Then she turned to Nathan's sister Amy and whispered loud enough for me to hear, I don't know why he married someone who can't even cook a proper meal. When we sat down to eat, Linda took one tiny bite of my perfectly roasted chicken into her napkin and announced to the whole table, this is completely dry. I feel bad for my son having to eat like this every night. Nathan just kept shoveling food in his face. Linda kept going, pushing her plate away. My mother would roll over in her grave seeing this pathetic attempt at a family dinner. That's when I set down my wine glass, smiled my sweetest smile and said, you know what, Linda, you're absolutely right. Why don't you show us how it's and make Thanksgiving This year? Everyone froze with their forks in the air. Nathan actually looked up from his plate for the first time. What Linda's face went from smug to panic, but she covered it with this weird laugh. I suppose I could show you all how it's actually supposed to be done. She spent the rest of dinner going on about her mother's secret stuffing recipe and how she'd make everything from scratch. The week before Thanksgiving, Linda called me asking, how many pounds do you think the Turkey should be? Oh, Linda, I wouldn't know since I never Learned to cook properly, remember? She called again asking, what temperature do you cook it at? Gosh, Linda, I just guess since I don't actually know how to cook. The night before Thanksgiving, she called pan making because she just remembered the Turkey needs to defrost. How long does that take? I said, someone with your expertise would know that and hung up. Thanksgiving morning, I rolled up to Linda's at 9 sharp with Starbucks. Linda answered the door already crying and still in her bathrobe. The 20 pound Turkey was sitting in her sink like a frozen bowling ball. It won't defrost, she screamed.

I said cancel the entire wedding. The call came Tuesday morning while I was editing a commercial in my home studio. This is Renee from Perfect Day Planning calling about Jared's wedding next month. Her voice sounded uncomfortable. I have some difficult news. Your family contacted us yesterday and asked us to remove you from the guest list entirely. They mentioned some family disagreements and said you wouldn't be welcome at the ceremony or reception. I paused my editing software. My family still sees me as the 29 year old college dropout who threw his life away to become a freelance videographer. What they don't know is what I actually do with all that video equipment filling my garage. However, Renee continued nervously. They also specifically requested to keep the fifty thousand dollar deposit you paid for the wedding photography package. Mrs. Ruth said the family had already allocated those funds to other wedding expenses and couldn't possibly return them. I leaned back in my chair looking at the wall of awards behind me, Emmy nominations, industry recognition, contracts with Fortune 500 company. It's my little video hobby. Had quietly become a 15 million dollar production company over the past eight years. Renee, I need to ask you something important. What's the name of your wedding venue? The Riverside Manor downtown. And who owns that property? I heard papers shuffling. On her end. Um, it's listed under Sunset Holdings LLC. Right. What about your catering company? Golden Plate Catering Services, also owned by Longer Pot Sunset Holdings LLC as well. Wait, what's going on here? The photography studio handling the wedding photos, Elite Moment Studio. Oh my god. That's also Sunset Holdings. The florist providing all the arrangements, Ella's Garden Creations. That's, that's you too, isn't it? The DJ company, the luxury transportation service, the rehearsal dinner venue, even the hotel block for out of town guests, all owned by Sunset Holdings LLC, which is my company. Renee's voice went up an octave. Mr Ruth, are you telling me that you own every single vendor for this wedding? I'm telling you that for the past eight months I've been secretly funding my brother's entire dream wedding through shell companies. I created every vendor, every service, every single detail of this wedding, all paid for by me through different LLCs so my family wouldn't know their disappointment son was actually footing the entire Bill for everything. This can't be happening. When I dropped out of film school 7 years ago, my parents told everyone I was throwing my life away. While they focused on Jared's safe marketing career at his corporate job, I was quietly building a production empire. Corporate videos, national commercials, award winning documentaries. I work with Netflix, HBO, major advertising agencies. But to my family, I'm still just a failure who plays with cameras. Sir, what exactly are You saying? I'm saying cancel everything. The venue rental, catering contract, floral arrangements, photography package, DJ services, transportation, all of it. Every single contract goes through companies I own. the wedding is in three weeks. There are.

When I was 15, my older brother Eric left home after this huge screaming match with our dad. Dad had always been super strict about everything, grades, curfew, chores, you name it. But Eric was 18 and wanted to do his own thing. You know, they got into it over something stupid like Eric staying out past midnight on a weekend. I remember standing at the top of the stairs listening to them yell. Dad was going off about respect and responsibility and Eric was shouting back about how nothing he ever did was good enough. Then dad said the words that still give me chills. If you walk out that door, don't bother coming back. Eric grabbed his backpack, stuffed some clothes in it and slammed the front door so hard the whole house shook. Mom tried calling him that night, but his phone went straight to voicemail. She left like 20 messages. Dad just sat in his recliner watching TV, acting like nothing happened. But I could tell he was waiting for Eric to come crawling back. We all were. Days turned into weeks. Mom would set an extra plate at dinner out of habit, then quietly put it away. She'd leave Eric's bedroom door open and sometimes I'd catch her just standing there staring at his unmade bed. Dad never talked about it, but he started checking his phone constantly, probably hoping for a text or Something I kept thinking Eric would show up for my birthday in October or maybe Thanksgiving when Christmas came and went with no word. I figured he was just being stubborn. Maybe he got a job somewhere. Maybe he had a girlfriend. Maybe he was living his best life and just didn't want to deal with family drama. Mom would cry sometimes when she thought nobody was looking. She sit at the kitchen table late at night staring at her phone waiting for a call that never came. Dad would find her there in the morning and they'd have these weird, quiet conversations that stopped when I walked in. Years went by. I graduated high school, started college. Sometimes I'd wonder if Eric even knew I existed anymore. I used to imagine running into him at a gas station or something and he'd be all successful and happy and we'd laugh about how stupid that fight was. I, I pictured him having kids someday that I'd never meet. The hardest part was how dad changed. He got softer with me. Like he was scared I'd leave, too. He'd ask about my friends, my classes, even offered to help with homework. He didn't understand. It was nice but also weird because I could tell he was thinking about Eric the whole time. Then I turned 21 and everything fell apart. I was at my apartment when this cop showed up at my door with an envelope they've been trying to reach My parents but couldn't get through. The letter was from the state police and it had Eric's name on it. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely read it. They'd found remains behind this old abandoned gas station about two towns over. Dental records confirmed it was Eric. The estimated time of death was about a month after he left home. Six years. He'd been dead for six whole years and we never knew. I drove home and found mom in the kitchen making dinner, like any other night when I told her.

So I snapped. What I discovered when I got there made me realize I'd raised a monster and I had to choose between my son and doing what was right. When my daughter in law, Emma called asking me to visit, I could hear something was wrong. She just had the baby three weeks ago, but her voice sounded hollow, defeated. I just, I need help, she whispered into the phone. But don't tell Kevin I called you. Red flag No. 1. Why couldn't she tell my son she needed support? I drove the four hours to their house. Immediately Kevin answered the door looking well rested, freshly showered, wearing clean clothes. Mom, what are you doing here? Emma called, I said, pushing past him. Where is she? I found Emma in the nursery, still in the same pajamas she'd probably worn for days. The baby was screaming. Emma was crying. The house was a disaster. Honey, when's the last time you slept, I asked. I don't know, she said, bouncing the baby mechanically. Tuesday, what day is it now? It was Friday. Kevin walked in, eating a sandwich. She's been a little emotional lately, he said casually. Hormones, you know? I looked at my son, my son who I'd raised to respect women and felt sick. When's the last time you held your daughter, I asked him. I held her yesterday, he said defensively, for like 20 minutes while Emma showered. 20? Minutes in a week. Your wife just had major surgery. She needs help. I work all day, he said. I'm tired, too. Emma was back at work. No, turns out Kevin meant his part time job at his buddies auto shop. Three days a week, four hours each. Meanwhile, Emma was up every two hours feeding the baby, doing all the night wakeings, plus somehow managing to keep the house from completely falling apart. I told her she could sleep when the baby sleeps, Kevin said, like he'd solve the problem, but she always finds something to clean instead. I watched Emma flinch at this like she was afraid to rest. That's when I realized what was really happening here. Emma, show me your phone, I said gently. She hesitated, glancing at Kevin nervously. It's okay, I said. Just show me. Her text messages with Kevin were.

The scratching sounds at night. Must be mice in the walls. Carol even hired an exterminator, but obviously they never found anything. Then one day, dad had an allergic reaction. His face puffed up like a balloon, and Carol went on a rampage trying to figure out what caused it. She questioned me for hours about whether I'd been near any animals. I lied straight to her face while Cheetah was literally hiding under my bed three feet away. The real drama started when Carol decided to deep clean the entire house. He was determined to find whatever was triggering Dad's allergies. I knew she'd be checking every corner of every room. I had to think fast. I convinced Annie to pet sit Cheeto for a few days. The plan was perfect, except for one tiny detail. Cheeto had scratched up the back of my closet door pretty badly. If Carol saw it during her cleaning spree, I was dead meat. So I did what any desperate kid would do. I accidentally broke my arm doing a skateboard trick right before the big clean. Carol spent the whole weekend driving me to the hospital and taking care of me instead of cleaning. Dad's allergies mysteriously cleared up while Cheeto was at Annie's. And Carol never suspected a thing. Two years, three close calls, and about 1,000 lies later, I finally moved out for college. The day I left, I smuggled Cheeto out in my laundry basket. He lived with Me in my dorm room. Against the rules, obviously. Then in my first apartment, and now he's sleeping on my lap as I type this. Dad and Carol still visit sometimes. Dad's allergies mysteriously act up every time, but he's never connected the dots. Carol still brags about how she's never allowed a single pet in her pristine house. Meanwhile, Cheeto just lounges on my couch, probably laughing at how he pulled off the greatest deception in family history.

When my dad married my stepmom, Carol, she had one strict rule. No pets allowed in the house. Carol was a neat freak who'd literally vacuum three times a day. She'd rather unalive herself than let an animal shed on her precious white carpets. But here's the thing. My dad was allergic to basically everything with fur. His eyes would swell shut if he even looked at a cat. So when I found a tiny orange kitten in the rain behind our garage, I knew I had to get creative. I built a little hideout in my closet using old Amazon boxes and blankets. Kitten, who I named Cheeto, lived there for two whole years without anyone finding out. I'd sneak food from dinner, clean his makeshift litter box when everyone was asleep, and vacuum up any stray fur before Carol's daily inspection. Getting Cheeto in and out of the house was like a military operation. I memorized everyone's schedules and had lookouts. My friend Robbie would text me when Carol left for yoga, and my neighbor Annie would warn me when she came back. I even trained Cheeto to stay completely silent whenever he heard Carol's voice. But keeping Cheeto hidden got harder as he grew bigger. Once, during Carol's surprise room inspection, he sneezed from inside the closet. I started fake sneezing and coughing to cover it up, then pretended I was coming down with something. Carol made Me stay home from school for three days, but at least she didn't check the closet. The closest call came when dad needed to grab something from my closet while I was at soccer practice. Robbie, who was over studying, created a whole diversion by accidentally on purpose spilling grape juice on Carol's new white couch. She completely forgot about the closet and spent two hours trying to get the stain out instead. I got really good at explaining away suspicious things. Random tuna cans in my trash. I'm trying to build muscle for soccer. The cat toy that fell out of my backpack. It's a stress ball for examining

This teenager getting her nails done for prom said she wished her boyfriend supported her choices like that, everyone was just rallying around me. Anna spent an extra hour making my nails absolutely perfect. When she was done, they looked like something you'd see on Instagram, long, elegant, with the most beautiful detailed artwork I'd ever seen on nails. She refused to let me pay the extra charge for all the upgrades. Took a picture and sent it to Kevin with the message, the salon thinks you're wrong. These look amazing. He immediately called me furious, saying I was being dramatic and that I made him look bad by showing strangers our private conversation. I told him I didn't make him look bad. His own words did. The engagement photos were the next day. I showed up with my stunning nails feeling confident and beautiful. Kevin's mom actually complimented them saying they looked very elegant and sophisticated. Kevin just stood there looking uncomfortable the whole time. But here's the kicker. After we got the photos back, Kevin posted them on social media without asking me. All his friends and family started commenting about how beautiful everything looked, especially my nails. His own cousin commented, those nails are perfect for an engagement shoot. Kevin tried to take credit telling people he helped me pick out the design. But I screenshot all the original text and posted them. In the comments I wrote, actually, Kevin called these trashy and tried To make me change them. Thankfully, the amazing women at the nail salon helped me realize I shouldn't have to dim my shine for anyone. The post blew up. His mom saw it and called him to ask why he would talk to me like that. His sister shared it on her story with crying, laughing emojis. Even his dad texted me privately to apologize for his son's behavior. Kevin deleted the whole post and begged me to delete my comments. But the damage was done. Everyone in his family started treating him differently after that. His mom started making little comments about how he needed to appreciate me more. We broke up two weeks later.

I was on jury duty. And the man being prosecuted was charged with burning down a farm building. Just a week before the building had burned down, the man was seen methodically moving all the valuables out of the barn. He was also seen meticulously mowing the hayfields for a 50 yards radius all around the barn to ensure the fire wouldn't spread. The day he set fire to the barn, he was seen walking around the entire thing, pouring something from a blue gas can onto the bottom of the barn walls. Not even a minute later, the entire building was fully engulfed in flames. The witness, who was the man's neighbor and had seen this entire thing, called the fire department and reported that the man had set the barn on fire. Fire department was on scene in about five minutes, but by that time the barn was already beyond saving. They did smell diesel fuel, though, and a quick investigation said it was clear arson. They arrested the man on the spot, but he refused to say anything. He also refused to talk to the DA and immediately asked for his lawyer. While on trial, the prosecution stated that they will prove the man, who was a farmer, set his own barn on fire. The barn was insured, meaning insurance fraud was the motive. They called All the expected witnesses, the neighbor, the fireman who smelled fuel, they played the 911 call, and so on. The defense lawyer did absolutely nothing this entire time. After about 40 minutes, the prosecution was finally done, and they had proved beyond doubt that the man set his own barn on fire for insurance fraud. Or so they thought. It was now the defense's turn, and the man's lawyer called the man up on the stand. His first question,

Jessica's life was a performance for her three friends. Next weekend, she walks into the kitchen while I'm making dinner. Oh my god, yes, I am. So in. A weekend away is exactly what I need. No, he's not coming. She hung up, beaming. The girls and I are going to the lake, leaving tomorrow. First I was hearing of it. Okay, sounds fun. Which lake? Simple question. Jessica looked at me like I'd asked her to explain quantum physics, laughed and turned to her friend who just walked in. Can you believe him? He wants to know where I'm going.

First stop, my eighty year old neighbor, Mrs. Gable, who has a surveillance network that would make the CIA jealous. I brought her lemon cake and explained what happened. Jessica's exact words, Missus Gable was patting my hand with righteous fury. That shameless little hussy. What's my line? I gave her a simple script for and Jessica inevitably found herself locked out. Then I began Operation Bachelor Pad Resurrection. My house had been beige pillows and pointless decorative bowls for six months. Time to reclaim my territory. I packed Jessica's things into labeled boxes, everyday clothes, fancy clothes for outings I wasn't invited to, 37 pairs of identical heels. By Saturday, everything was moved to a storage unit. Then the real fun began. I replaced the beige rug with Astroturf that looked like a football field.

And we weren't taking her to Any more Italian restaurants?

After she left, my husband said I should apologize. He said she's 60 years old. She's only left Italy twice in her whole life, once to Germany like 25 years ago. He said she's just set in her ways and doesn't know how to adapt. I told him that's not my problem. If she can't survive without Italian food for two weeks, there's no point in me pretending to like her anyway.

She looked at the menu like I just asked her to eat dirt. No, no sushi. Italian food is the best. Okay, cool. I get it. You're proud of your culture. We went to an Italian restaurant that night. She spent 20 minutes complaining about how the pasta was overcooked and the cheese wasn't real Parmigiano. My husband just kept nodding and saying, yeah, it's different here. I bit my tongue because she just got here and I didn't want to start anything. The next day, we tried Thai food. He didn't even sit down. Just looked at the place and said, she wanted Italian again. Fine. We went to another Italian spot. Same thing. The wine was too sweet, the bread was wrong, the tomatoes didn't taste like home. I'm sitting there thinking like, you flew halfway across the world to eat the exact same stuff you eat every day. Day three, same nonsense. No Chinese food, no Vietnamese. Just Italian. And not just any Italian. She'd find something wrong with every single dish. The sauce was too thick, the pasta was the wrong shape, they used the wrong oil. My husband kept apologizing to the waiters. It was Embarrassing. Then she got mad at me for ordering a cappuccino at, like, four in the afternoon. She literally put her hand on my arm and said, we don't drink cappuccino after 12. I just stared at her and said, well, I'm not Italian, so I'm gonna drink whatever I want. She got all huffy and didn't talk to me for an hour. The coffee thing became this whole issue. Every morning she'd complain, too burnt, not hot enough, the milk was wrong, the cup was too big. I started making her coffee, and she'd take one sip and make this face like I just poisoned her. My husband would remake it. Still wrong. We went to kohl's to get groceries, and she completely lost it in the pasta aisle. Started going off about how none of it was authentic, how Australia didn't understand Italian food.

When our daughter Mia was born, keeping Leo away from her was a full time job. We had to move her crib into our bedroom and lock the door just to keep her secure. Later, when Mia was old enough to start losing her baby teeth, we did the whole tooth fairy thing. She put a tooth under her pillow and wake up to a few dollars. But every single morning after showing us the money, she'd tell us the tooth itself was missing. My husband and I never touched them. Around that same time, Leo claimed the old shed in our backyard as his clubhouse and told us to stay out. But I'm his mother, so one day I went in to see what he was up to. I found all of Mia's missing teeth laid out in a neat little row on his workbench. A cold feeling washed over me. When we confronted him about it, he just lost it. He screamed horrible things at us before locking himself in his room for three straight days. Over the years, we tried therapy and he was kicked out of several schools. It wasn't until high school that we saw just how risky he Was one afternoon a girl from his class knocked on our door. She looked terrified. She told me Leo had been following her home from school every day. She said she was scared for her life and didn't know who else to turn to because no one would listen. My stomach sank. I heard the real fear in her voice and I apologized over and over. I promised I would talk to him, but deep down I knew it wouldn't do any good. Nothing I said ever did. That afternoon when I mentioned the girl, he exploded. He started flipping chairs and throwing things across the kitchen. I had to run and lock myself in our bedroom to get away from him. The last thing I heard was him screaming, you'll all pay for this, before he slammed the back door and went to the shed. I stayed in my room until my husband got home. He saw the broken kitchen window and the mess from Leo's Fit and got mad. I'll go talk to him, he said. Maybe he'll listen to his father. Then he walked out to the shed. A minute later, I heard a scream that I will never forget. I ran outside and found my husband on his knees in the grass just crying. He looked up at me and whispered, don't go in there. But I had to see. I ran right past him. When I opened the shed door, I saw him.

Okay, is this true Robert? Is this girl using you? I mean, no, I don't think so, bro. How much money has she borrowed from you in the past 3 months? Did you forget that? How much is in the past week? Has she even paid you back? Dude, she's my girlfriend. Hey, I'm I'm gonna spend money on her you know, I mean, I'm gonna take her shopping and stuff. Yeah. Is that all that this is about Jason? Is he spends too much money on her? Uh, no, I mean, I understand that you're gonna take your girlfriend out to dinner and shopping and things like that but uh, I mean, the first of all, he shouldn't be paying her rent and second of all, she shouldn't be cheating on you. She shouldn't be cheating on you. No, exactly. That's really what we're calling to find out is if she's cheating on him you know, if she's loyal to him and he feels like spending all his money on her, what are you gonna do? That's that's his prerogative right? But if she's cheating on him, at least Jason hopes this will open Robert's eyes a little bit. So we are about to call Steph okay, the girlfriend and we are going to play Use this stupid voice, Scotty of the balls. Silly voice of the naked game. I love it. I love it. Good. Then give me some dialing music. Dialing at. Now ask you all to please be quiet until we begin the naked game here on. Scotty the ball. Hello. Hey, good morning. Is this Steph? I'm sorry. What I said? I said, is this Steph? Yes. Who is this Steph? This is Scotty and the buzz from 98.6 FM, Scotty and the Buzz Morning Show. How are you today? Sounds like we just woke you up. Yeah, you did. Well, listen, though, there's a reason we called you. We have a young man on our contest line who is playing the naked game. The naked game. And he swears that if we ask you the question, who was the last person to see you naked, you'll say his name. Now, if you do, you'll both win a round trip flight to a very romantic tropical location of your choice. So the question is, Steph, who was the last person besides yourself to see you naked? To see me naked, yes. Hey, baby, baby.

And when we married, I use my Tyrone skills, if you know what I mean, to convince her not to sign a prenup. Because what's hers is mine, and what's mine is Mine. Basically, in case of a divorce, I'll get half of it. Damn, bro, you smart. Smart. But still, how are you so chill about her cheating on you? Well, she's not the only one cheating.

No warning, just a text. We're in Hawaii. Take care of the kids. It was a Wednesday evening in late September, just after six forty five PM I had pulled into the YMCA parking lot in Portland to pick up our four kids from their after school swim program. Normally, my wife Lauren handled pickups while I wrapped up my shifts at the hospital. But that night as I cut the engine of my Honda Accord, my phone buzzed. It was from Lauren. Just one sentence, we're in Hawaii. Take care of the kids. I blinked, reread it and sat frozen. A knock on the passenger window startled me. There they were, Ethan clutching his wet towel, Mia trying to wrestle her goggles off in Caleb and Riley dragging oversized backpacks. Four confused faces peering in. Where's mom, Ethan asked. I forced a smile, though my hands were shaking. She had something come up. I'm here. Instead. Back home, the silence was unbearable. I called straight to voicemail. I texted back. What do you mean we? Who's we? What about the kids? No reply. Not that night, not the next morning. Two days later, her sister called me. Did Lauren mention a trip? No, nothing. Her mom clueless. Her coworkers HR told me she'd requested unpaid leave three weeks earlier quietly behind my back. That's when it hit me. She planned this. Suddenly I was a single parent. Overnight packing lunches, braiding Mia's hair, fixing Caleb's broken Glasses at eleven PM, trying not to break down when Riley whispered, daddy, did mom forget us? By week 3, exhaustion gave way to anger. She hadn't just left me, she left them. One night after putting the kids to bed, I opened our shared icloud account. Lauren wasn't tech savvy and I'd set up all her devices years ago. I scrolled through synced photos and emails, praying for some mistake. And I saw it, a reservation at the Royal Chi Resort in Maui. Two tickets, Lauren and a Mark Ellis. Mark, my best friend since college, the guy who toasted at our wedding, the man who'd asked me for a five thousand dollar loan last year. When his startup collapsed, my stomach dropped. I didn't rage. I didn't call him. I didn't send threats. That's what they'd expect.

I grew up in a cult where children who scored too high on monthly IQ tests were lobotomized to preserve the social balance because smart kids grew up to question the community leaders and their divine revelations. My parents joined an intentional community when I was three, selling everything to buy into this Utopia where Brother Gabriel promised enlightenment through simplicity. He was this creepy 60 year old who claimed god spoke directly to him, but only when teenage girls gave him private massages. Inner circle of drooling devotees had all undergone divine simplification, which I didn't understand until I was old enough to notice the scars on their foreheads and their empty smiles. Mom thought their peacefulness was spiritual transcendence. She didn't realize their frontal lobes had been scrambled with an ice pick to keep them from ever questioning Brother Gabriel's increasingly insane revelations. When I was 10, it was time for me to start partaking in the mandatory monthly devil checks that Brother Gabriel required for all kids. He explained to my parents that god had revealed to him that intelligence above 120 was actually Satan, trying to corrupt young minds with dangerous questions. Any child who scored too high would receive divine simplification to return them to a state of holy innocence. He showed us videos of the procedure, an ice pick through the eye socket, while calling it a blessing. Smart children grow into doubters, he said, staring Right at me. And doubt is the enemy of paradise. My first test was next week. I Learned fast that the secret to survival was failing on purpose. But Brother Gabriel's tests were designed to trap smart kids with questions that changed based on previous answers, making it impossible to consistently play dumb. I watched my friend Lily try to fail and accidentally reveal her intelligence through the pattern of her wrong answers. Two days later, she came back from the medical building with bandages over her eyes and a vocabulary of about 50 words. She smiled constantly now and clapped when Brother Gabriel spoke like a trained seal. The parents helped enforce it. They brag about their children's low scores like they were achievements. Hazel only scored 85 this month. Praise god, my mom would say, not knowing I'd spent hours calculating exactly which answers to Miss. Who scored between 90 to 110 were safe. Below 90 raised suspicions of cheating. Above 110 put you on the watch list. Above 1, 20 meant surgery within the week. Brother Gabriel made the smart kids wear red ribbons before their procedures so everyone could pray for their healing. Never forget watching Oliver, who loved astronomy and could name every constellation, walking around with that red ribbon while his parents prepared his Celebration dinner for after his lobotomy. He kept trying to tell people about the stars, but nobody would listen because he was already marked. After his procedure, he couldn't even Remember what stars were? His parents threw a party where he sat in the corner eating cake with his hands drooling and giggling at nothing. I couldn't keep faking scores forever, so I started studying Brother Gabriel. Instead of hiding from him, I snuck into his office and found his real psychiatric files from before he started the cult. Turns out he'd been a failed neurosurgeon. He lost his license for performing unauthorized lobotomies on patients who questioned his methods. But more interesting were his financial records, showing he was embezzling millions while keeping us in poverty. I photographed everything and did something crazy. During the next community meeting, I raised my hand and asked why god needed Brother Gabriel to have three Ferraris when we weren't allowed cars. The room went silent. I kept going, asking why God's Rev.

It happened during an argument about her curfew. Carmen would let me stay out until midnight. She screamed. She actually understands me. I wish she was my real mom instead of you. I stood there in our kitchen holding the car keys she wanted, feeling something inside me shatter. Carmen, my ex husband's 20 six year old wife. The yoga instructor who bought my daughter designer clothes and let her drink wine at dinner. The cool mom who didn't enforce bedtimes or check homework. Your curfew is still 10 p m, I said quietly, slipping the keys into my pocket. I hate you! Natalie shouted. You're ruining my life! Dad and Carmen treat me like an adult! She ran to her room and slammed the door. I heard her immediately on the phone. Mom's being a total bitch again. Can you come get me? Forty minutes later, my ex pulled up in his BMW. Didn't even come to the door. Natalie dragged her overnight bag downstairs, refusing to look at me. I'm staying at Dad's this week, maybe permanently. Natalie, you have school. Carmen will drive me. She doesn't have a real job anyway. The job was intentional. I work 50 hours a week as a nurse to keep our apartment, pay for her braces, her phone, her life. Carmen teaches yoga three times a week and post motivational quotes on Instagram. After they left, I sat On Natalie's bed. Looked around her room. The walls still had the stars we painted together when she was seven. The bookshelf I built with my own hands. The quilt my mother made before she passed. But her Instagram was full of photos from her dad's house. Carmen's pristine kitchen, the pool, the shopping sprees. Captions like with my favourite person. Heart, eyes under selfies with Carmen. Not one photo of us. I was the one up all night when she had pneumonia at three. I taught her how to ride a bike, how to read, how to be kind. I worked doubles to pay for her dance classes while her father found himself in Thailand for six months. But Carmen was fun. Carmen was young. Carmen didn't make her eat vegetables or go to bed or study. Natalie stayed at her dad's for two weeks. Posted constantly about her amazing bonus, mom and their girls nights. Carmen taught her how to contour, bought her outfits I'd said were too grown up. Let her boyfriend sleep over. Then Carmen got bored. I got the call at 2:00am. Natalie crying. Mom, can you come get me? What's wrong? Dad and Carmen went to Vegas. They left me here alone. I, I think someone's trying to break in. I drove 20 minutes in my pajamas. A baseball bat on the passenger seat. Found her hiding in the bathroom, shaking. The break in turned out to be tree branches scratching the window. But She'd been alone for two days. I said I was mature enough to handle it. She whispered in the car. Carmen said it was good practice for college. You're 15. I know. Back home, I made her hot chocolate. Real cocoa, not the sugar free kind Carmen buys. Natalie sat at

My ex wife venmoed me $500 with a message, make our daughter hate you. I stared at my phone screen reading it three times. Rebecca and I had been divorced for two years. Our custody arrangement was working fine. Bella stayed with me every other week and she seemed happy with both of us. Then my phone rang. Did you see the payment? Rebecca's voice was, I, it's cold. Yeah. What the hell does that message mean? Bella keeps asking to live with you full time. She told her school counselor she wants to change her address. I can't let that happen. My stomach drops. Rebecca, she's 11. Kids say things. No, she's serious. She even asked me to call a lawyer. Her voice got sharper. But if she thinks you're a deadbeat dad who doesn't care about her, she'll stop asking. Are you insane? Miss her violin recital tomorrow night? I'll tell her you were too busy with work. Do it for a month. Miss her soccer games, forget to pick her up, show up late to everything. She'll give up on you and stop this custody nonsense. I'm not going to hurt my daughter for money. You're behind three months on rent. Adam, your delivery job barely covers gas. Take the money. Miss some events and Bella learns that her mom is the reliable parent. She hung up. The $500 sat in my account like poison. I was Broke. My landlord had already threatened eviction twice. But this was Bella, my little girl who texted good morning every single day, who saved half her dessert to share with me at dinner. The recital was Thursday at seven PM I worked until 6:30, then sat in my car outside the school staring at the building. I could take the money, missed the recital. Rebecca would comfort Bella, tell her daddy was too busy and maybe Bella would stop asking to live with me or I could be her father. I walked inside at 6:55. Bella was third to form when she spotted me in the back row. Her entire face lit up. She played Pacbell's cannon like an angel, never taking her eyes off me. Rebecca saw me from the front row. Her expression went from surprise to pure your rage. After the performance, Bella ran over with her violin case bouncing against her legs. Dad, you came. I thought you had to work. Wouldn't miss it for the world, sweetheart. You were incredible. She hugged me tight. Mom said you probably couldn't make it because of your job. I glanced at Rebecca, who was pretending to talk to another parent while shooting daggers at me. I'll always make time for the important stuff and that.

Divorce finalized in October. She didn't contest anything my lawyer said. She just sat there crying while the judge signed papers. I wasn't there, did it all remotely. Five years passed. First year was brutal. Therapy twice a week just to function. But slowly I rebuilt everything. New job, became a real career, made actual friends, started rock climbing and hiking. Met Julia at a climbing gym year 3. She was patient with my baggage, listened when I needed to talk, never judged me for running. We moved in together last year into a house we bought. Last Tuesday morning, I was making coffee before work. Julia was in the shower. Doorbell rang at 7:00am. Weird but figured packaged. I opened the door. My ex wife standing on my porch in Tennessee, 900 miles from where I'd left her, holding grocery store flowers, mascara streaking down her face, looking like she hadn't slept in weeks. How did you find me? I hired someone, she said, shaking. A private investigator. Took eight months, but he found you. Eight months actively searching. My skin crawled. Why? James left me six months ago for someone younger. I've been alone and I realized I made the biggest mistake of my life. We can fix this. Start over. I forgive you for leaving. I actually laughed. You forgive me, baby, please. Who's at the door? Julia's voice behind me. She walked up in her bathrobe, coffee mug in hand, wrapped her arm around my Waist one look at my ex and she understood everything. His face went white. Stared at Julia, then at the photos on our entryway wall, us hiking at her sister's wedding, building our deck together. You moved on, she whispered. Five years ago, I said, the day I left, I came all this way. I'm sorry for everything. Can we just talk? Julia squeezed my hand, didn't say anything, just stood there supporting me. I looked at the woman on my porch, the one who destroyed me so completely, I had to flee 900 miles to survive. She looks smaller now, desperate. You hired a Pi, I said calmly, spent eight months tracking me down. So you know I'm engaged now, right? Her eyes dropped to Julia's left hand. The ring, weddings in October. Julia added quietly, you should leave. X opened her mouth, closed it, tears streaming. I loved you. No, I said firmly, you didn't. But I'm glad you found me. Now I know the 3,000 art I spent on that lawyer was worth every penny. I closed the door. Through it, I heard her collapse crying on the porch. Julia pulled me into a hug. You okay? I held her. Heard X's footsteps retreat. Car door slam, engine start, drive away. Yeah, I said, I really am.

Asked them to show up at noon with decorations and cake. Told them to keep it secret that she thought I was out of town. They ate it up. Her mom was practically crying with joy. Said I was the most thoughtful son in law ever. Even offered to bring her famous potato salad. I left the house at 9:00am with my suitcase, just like I said I would. Waved goodbye to her from the driveway. She blew me a kiss from the doorway, already in her silk robe, the one I bought her for Christmas. I drove around the block and parked three streets over, right where I could see our driveway. Waited in my car with a coffee and a breakfast sandwich from the Corner Deli. At 10:40, 7:00am, a silver BMW pulled up. Didn't recognize the car, but I recognized his face immediately from the photos on her burner phone. Her project manager from work. The one she'd been texting, I miss you, too. At 2:00am, while I slept next to her, I watched him walk up to my front door. Watched her answer in that same silk robe. Watched her pull him inside and close the door. I sat there for another hour, stomach turning, but I waited. Timing had to be perfect. Perfect. At 11:55 a m, I met her family outside our building. Her mom was holding a custom cake from the expensive bakery. White frosting, With pink flowers that said, happy 32nd birthday, Taylor. Her sister had a bouquet of balloons. Her best friend carried a bag of presents wrapped in gold paper. Everyone was grinning, so excited to surprise her. I had my key ready. Told everyone to be super quiet, that we'd sneak down the hall and really shock her. They were giggling like kids on Christmas morning. Her mom kept adjusting the candles on the cake. We walked in silent. I could hear music playing from the bedroom, her favorite playlist. Her mom was trying not to laugh, holding that cake with both both hands. Her sister kept whispering, she's going to freak out. Her friend was recording on her phone. We made our way down the hall. I positioned everyone right outside the bedroom door. Her mom held up the cake. 32 candles flickering. Everyone raised their party horns, fingers on the triggers. I mouthed, one, two, three, and threw open the door. The party horns went off at the exact same moment her mom dropped a cake.

I knew something was off when she started working late every Tuesday. At first I believed her. She's always been dedicated to her career. But then the little things started piling up. She'd come home smelling different, not perfume exactly, but like someone else's laundry detergent. Her phone was suddenly password protect. Did after eight years of marriage. And she started going to the gym at weird hours. Ten PM on a Wednesday. Really the breaking point was finding the second phone in her gym bag. I was looking for her water bottle to wash it and there it was, a cheap prepaid phone still logged into everything. Messages, photos, tell reservations, all of it. Here's what I Learned in that moment. Don't confront. Immediately, I wanted to scream. I wanted to throw that phone against the wall and demand answers. But something in me said to wait, document everything first. So I did. For three months, I played the perfect husband. I screenshotted every text on that burner phone when she was in the shower. I saved receipts from hotels I'd never been to, restaurants we'd never eaten at. I tracked her late nights on a calendar, built an airtight case and handed it all to a lawyer. My attorney loved me, said most guys come in with nothing but suspicion. I came in with a legal nuclear weapon. Her birthday rolled around in October, Three months into My silent investigation. I asked what she wanted to do and she got this strange look on her face, said she wanted me to go visit my brother for the weekend. Said she just wanted a quiet day at home, maybe order take out and watch movies. Didn't want to be reminded she was getting older. I knew that was complete garbage. He loves her birthday last year, she had a party with 40 people. That morning. I found champagne hidden in the garage, the expensive kind, $200 a bottle, two crystal glasses wrapped in tissue paper tucked behind the paint cans. Candles, too, the fancy ones from that boutique store downtown she always dragged me to. Something in me snapped, but not in an angry way, in a calculated way. So I called her mom, then her sister, then her best friend from college, the one who was in our wedding, told them all the same story. I want.

Years later, she's tracking me down, begging to reconcile after her affair partner dumped her. When I found the hotel receipts in February 2018, I didn't confront. I just sat in my car outside our apartment for two hours staring at them. Room 6 14 at the downtown Marriott. Charged to her company card three times that month. $289 each night. I went inside acting completely normal. She was on the couch drinking wine, watching TV. Asked how my day was. I said fine. Made small talk about dinner. My hands were shaking that night while she slept next to me. I opened a new bank account at a different. Over three months, I became a ghost. Transferred money in amounts she wouldn't notice. $200 here, $300 there. Started taking work trips that were actually job interviews in other cities. Tennessee, Colorado, Oregon. Anywhere far enough, she'd never look. I hired a private investigator for two weeks. Got photos of her and him at that same hotel. Holding hands at restaurants, kissing in the parking garage at her office. My lawyer said I didn't need any of it for no fault divorce. But I wanted the proof to know I wasn't crazy. Tennessee job offer came in may. Software company. 30% pay raise, full relocation package. I accepted same day and made them keep it confidential. Got a new phone with a new number. Started forwarding Mail to a PO Box in Knoxville. Found an apartment online. Small one bedroom, fully furnished. Month to month lease. Wired the deposit for my secret count. Tired movers for a Saturday in June. When I told her I had a week long conference in Seattle That morning. I packed everything that mattered while she was at Saturday. Yoga class, probably meeting him. Grandmother's pocket watch, photo albums from before we met. My two guitars, Dad's toolbox. Everything else was just stuff left her. The furniture, the dishes, everything. Left my wedding ring on the kitchen counter next to the door. Voice papers. My lawyer delivered them the day after I left. I was already in Tennessee, 900 miles away when she started calling. By end of first week, 67 missed calls messages. Where are you? Please call me back. I can explain. This isn't what you think. I blocked her number, changed mine again just to be safe. Deleted Facebook, Instagram, everything. My close friends knew what happened. I'd shown three of them the PI photos before leaving. They understood. When she started calling them trying to find me, even they cut her off. My mom talked to her exactly once. Just to say I was alive and safe and she needed to stop. X drove to my parents house the next day. Showed up crying, begging for my address or number. My dad told her if she came back, he'd call the police.

I went back to the messages six months ago, when we've been dating only two months. Carlos, how's the girlfriend situation? Conrad, the sister is everything I wanted. She's so desperate for a good guy, she doesn't even notice. Nelson, Mine's the same. Dating the older one to get to her 13 year old sister. They had a whole system network. Each guy had photos in those folders. Some had dozens of girls. Conrad came back. I quickly locked his phone and set it down, my mind racing, but my face calm. I feel sick. Can I use your phone to call the Uber? Mine's dead. He handed it over without hesitation. Dumbass. While pretending to pull up the app, I screenshotted everything I could and airdropped them to myself. My hands were completely steady. I. I knew exactly what I was going to do.

Bring Your friends. I wanna meet them, too. With a wink emoji. Lily, are you serious right now? He texted, back side, exit by the football field. 3 p m. He sent back five heart emojis. My skin crawled in disgust. Next day, I watched from the coffee shop across the school as Conrad's car pulled up. Carlos's truck was right behind, then his friend Nelson. Then three more cars. I didn't recognize six of them. They'd all come running. For a 14 year old girl, mind you, they're all over 22. Conrad was checking his breath, smoothing his shirt. Then five police cars surrounded them. It was beautiful. They scattered like roaches. Conrad tried to run away before they tackled him. His face hit the pavement. Carlos tried to drive away, but smashed right into a cop car. The others didn't even make it out of their vehicles. Conrad was screaming my name as they dragged him away. Gia set me up. This is Gia. The officer looked at him and said, good for Gia. The FBI found over 2,000 photos in their drive. Conrad's in federal prison now, and I deleted hinge for good.

I was making sixty six thousand dollars a year and I've been working five years. Year five, everything shifted. Dad landed a big contract, shopping complex, 8 hundred thousand dollar job, but it required stamped engineering plans. We had to subcontract the design work. The engineer who showed up was 26, my age. She had a tablet with 3D models, pointed out three structural issues in Dad's original plan that would have failed inspection. Dad paid her $15,000 for two weeks of work. I made $15,000 in three months. That night dad asked me to come over. Mom was already in bed. He poured two beers. You ever think about going back to school? He asked. I stared at him. What college, engineering school, whatever you wanted to do. You told me it was a waste. I was quiet for a long time. I was wrong. I see these young guys coming in with degrees, getting hired as project managers right out of school, making what I pay you and they're just starting. So the $50,000 was for nothing. It wasn't for nothing. You Learned the trade. You know construction inside and out. But Cole, he looked tired, suddenly old. You hit a ceiling without that degree. I hit it at 40. You'll hit it at 30. Why didn't you tell me this five years ago? Because I was scared of losing you to some office job. Thought if I got you invested in the company, Early you'd stay he the drink. That was selfish. I drove home at midnight, did the math in my head, if I went back now, I graduated at 35 years behind. Still have to work to pay for it since the $50,000 was long gone. Truck payments, apartment life. My buddy Marcus texted me the next day photo of his new house, three bedrooms just closed. I was still renting. I looked at college applications that night. Then I looked at my bank account. Then I closed the laptop. Six months later, I'm still framing houses. I'm making $32 an hour. Dad's talking about retirement, wants me to take over the business. But I've been watching YouTube videos on structural engineering, taking free online courses at night, saving every extra dollar. Maybe it's not too late. Maybe the most expensive thing dad ever bought me was five years. I can't get back. But I'm not buying into someone else's ceiling anymore, even if it's my father's. Turns out the worst investment isn't the money you spend. It's the potential you trade for someone else's limited vision of your future.

It was employee appreciation day at Techcore Industries. You know the drill. Stale doughnuts, motivational posters, HR rolling around with branded water bottles. I just finished an early morning call when I noticed something weird on my desk. A sleek black box. Not like the cheap gift bags everyone else got. No company logo, no bow, just sitting there like it was waiting for me. That's when my manager, Jake, walked past. He literally froze mid step, staring at the box like it might explode. Don't open that, he whispered. What? Why? He wouldn't look at me. Just mumbled, can't you see? And hurried away. My stomach dropped. Something was very wrong. I looked closer at the box. Underneath, barely visible was a label, my full name, my employee ID, and a time stamp, 203:00am. Here's the thing. Three weeks earlier, I'd noticed someone had been accessing my employee files at 2:00am multiple times. I'm a software engineer, so I'd built a simple monitoring tool that logged any unauthorized changes to my records. Just a little insurance policy. And those middle of the night edits kept happening. My performance reviews from years ago were being modified. My benefits information was changed, then changed back files I'd Never seen before, were being created with my digital signature, except I never signed them. Someone was building a fake paper trail. And I had a pretty good idea why. See, I was about to hit a major vesting milestone on my stock grants worth about $46,000. And I'd noticed a pattern. Several women over 40 in our company had mysteriously been fired for performance issues right before their stock vested. Every single one. So when I saw that time stamp on the box, 203:00am.

I deleted hinge 3 times before matching with Conrad. Unlike every other guy, he suggested coffee instead of drinks, asked about my dreams, not my body, and bought me pink roses every Friday. Everyone thought he was perfect. It was supposed to be a normal Friday night. Conrad was cooking dinner at his apartment while I scrolled through Netflix. The pink roses he brought sitting on the coffee table. His phone kept buzzing on the counter. Just the guys talking about the game tomorrow, he said, weirdly fast. You check if that's my Doordash. I ordered dessert. I grabbed his phone. No Doordash notification, but a text preview caught my eye. Did you finally do what we talked about? Something made me pause. The message was from someone named Carlos. I'd met Carlos once, Conrad's friend who gave where my hug at Energy. Conrad went to the bathroom. His phone was still unlocked in my hand. I'm typically not that girl. But I opened his messages. I scrolled past the group chat, seeing boring stuff about basketball and work complaints and I saw my sister's name. Conrad, how's it going with Lily? My stomach turned to ice. Why were Conrad's friends asking about my 14 year old sister? Conrad had responded, good, she trust me now keeps asking when I'm coming over. I scrolled up, my heart beating faster. Two weeks ago Carlos had asked if Conrad was getting Anywhere. Conrad's response made me sick. I'm only with Gia because her sister has a fat ass. But you have to play it smart. Carlos's response, 8 months is dedication, bro. Conrad, Lily's worth it. You've seen the pics. What pics? I kept scrolling a month ago, Conrad wrote, she is so naive. Meanwhile, Lily texts me behind her back, asks me for advice and sends me snaps throughout the day. The guys responded with legend and playing the long game and how much longer? Three months ago made me want to deck him. Conrad picked Lily up from gymnastics, got some good shots when she wasn't looking. Someone responded, add them to the drive. Conrad already did. Check the freshman folder. The freshman folder. My hands shook as I clicked on a Google Drive link. In their chat folders labeled by age, 13, 14, 15, inside were photos of girls in high school hallways, at gymnastics meets, in mall food courts. Creep shop.

Five years later, he asked why I never went back to school. The offer came the day after my high school graduation. 50 grand, dad said, sliding a check across the kitchen table. Cash right now. You come work for me instead of going to state. I stared at the check. My name, $50,000, signature at the bottom. I got into the engineering program. I know. And you'll spend four years learning theory while going $60,000 in debt. Or you can start making real money tomorrow. Learn a real trade. Mom was doing dishes, didn't turn around, but her shoulders were tense. It's a good school, dad. It's a waste. My company is doing $2 million a year. You could be running it someday, but I need someone I can trust on job sites now. The check sat between us, $50,000. My tuition deposit was $500. I'd already sent it. What if I want to do both? Work summers, go to school during. This is an either or offer, Cole. You want the money, you commit full time, no college. I looked at mom. She was gripping the edge of the sink. Take the night to think about it, dad said, but I need an answer by morning. Got three projects starting Monday. I didn't sleep, just stared at that check on my nightstand. In the morning, I took the money. The first year was good. I Learned framing, electrical, plumbing. Dad paid me $22 an hour, which felt like a fortune. I bought a truck, got my own apartment. My high school friends came home for Christmas break with stories about meal plans and freshman seminars. I showed them my new F1, 50. Year 2, dad made me a site supervisor, $28 an hour, more responsibility, longer hours. I was good at it, really good. The crew respected me because I worked as hard as they did. Year 3, I started noticing things. Dad's bids were getting rejected. We lost a commercial project to a firm that used computer modeling, dacted. The owner kept mentioning his son, the one with the civil engineering degree. That's just fancy drawings, dad said. We build with our hands. But the jobs kept going to the guys with the fancy drawings. Year 4, Dad had a health scare. Nothing serious, but enough to slow him down. He's started talking about me taking over sooner than planned. You'll run this whole operation by the time you're 30, he said. Better than any degree. I was making $32 an hour by then. I'd saved $40,000. I had a girlfriend, a routine, a life. But I kept thinking about my friend Marcus. He graduated last spring. Chemical engineer, starting salary.

You know, white isn't the bridal color in Indian weddings, right? I froze. In all my panic about Kayla's manipulation tactics, I completely forgotten that crucial detail. Kayla had no idea Priya would be wearing a stunning red lehenga with intricate gold embroidery. Wedding day arrives. I'm getting ready with my groomsmen when my cousin texts, dude, your sister just walked in looking like she thinks she's the bride. My stomach dropped until I remembered Priya's words. Then I actually started laughing. Kayla struts in wearing this elaborate white ball gown, strapless with a cathedral train, clearly custom made and expensive. She'd even hired a professional makeup artist and had her hair done in an elaborate updo with white flowers. The confused looks from Priya's family were absolutely priceless. Indian weddings are vibrant, colourful celebrations. And here's Kayla looking like she wandered in from a completely different century. During the ceremony, I kept glancing at Kayla. She looked increasingly uncomfortable as she realised everyone was staring at her for all the wrong reasons. Priya looked absolutely radiant in her traditional red and gold, surrounded by family and brilliant blues, greens and purples, while Kayla stood out like a sore thumb in stark white. But the absolute best part came during the reception. Priya's grandmother, this tiny 80 year old woman who'd flown in from Mumbai, walked straight up to Kayla. In her thick accent, she loudly asked, Ada, why are you dressed for a funeral at a Wedding? Did someone die that we should know about? The entire hall went silent, then erupted in laughter. Kayla's face went bright red as she stammered some excuse about western traditions. But Nani wasn't done. In my day, only widows wore white to celebrations. Are you mourning something dear? Should we be concerned? More laughter rippled through the crowd. Even my parents were chuckling behind their hands. Kayla realized she looked completely ridiculous in white. While the actual bride glowed in traditional colors, surrounded by guests and vibrant sorries and lahangas that made her look like a ghost at a rainbow party. She grabbed her purse and left early, muttering about cultural misunderstandings and disrespectful in laws. Meanwhile, everyone spent the rest of the night complimenting Priya's stunning outfit and asking about the beautiful traditions. For once, Kayla's desperate attempt to steal the spotlight completely backfired. Best wedding gift ever.

I'll keep it brief, she promised. Just three simple questions. He leaned back, clearly amused. Go ahead. When exactly did you purchase that Mercedes? She asked. Three weeks before the storm, he answered proudly. Custom ordered from Germany. She nodded. And what was its purchase value? $94,000, he dated confidently, as our evidence shows. One last question, she said steadily. What was your insurance deductible on that vehicle? The businessman's face fell. I don't recall exactly, missus Peterson turned and made her way back to her table. She opened her folder and withdrew a document which she handed to the judge. This is a copy of Mister Harrington's insurance claim filed the morning after the storm, she explained quietly. He listed the car's value at $38,000 and received full compensation minus his five hundred dollars deductible. The insurance company has confirmed this in writing. The silence in that courtroom was deafening. From her folder she produced emails between the businessman and three tree removal companies, all dated the week before the storm. These weren't requests to remove her tree, but inquiry specifically about insurance coverage for storm damage. The businessman started the protest, but Mrs. Peterson had saved her most damning evidence for last. Presented security footage from the businessman's own camera showing him dragging additional branches onto his already damaged Mercedes the morning after the storm. This footage is time stamped 6:23 a m, approximately four hours after the tree fell, she explained. My grandson works in digital security and helped me request these records legally. Judge Reynolds reviewed everything in silence. The businessman and his attorneys whispered frantically among themselves. Finally the judge looked up. Case dismissed, he announced firmly. Furthermore, I'm referring this matter to the district attorney for investigation of potential insurance fraud. As the businessman stormed out, missus Peterson gathered her folder in Kane. I helped her down the courthouse steps afterward, and she told me she'd lived next to that horrible man for 12 years. Sometimes, she said with a small smile, people think being old means being helpless. That's their mistake, I later heard. The businessman faced insurance fraud charges and was ordered to pay Missus Peterson's legal costs. The elderly woman walked away with her dignity intact and a story that taught everyone in that courtroom a powerful lesson about underestimating people.

I was a bailiff for 15 years and saw one that still gives me chills. This wealthy businessman sued his elderly neighbour for property damage after her oak tree fell during a storm, crushing his Mercedes. He walked in like he owned the courthouse. Tailored suit, gold watch flashing under the lights, flanked by two attorneys carrying matching leather briefcases. Kind of legal team you assemble when you're not just trying to win, but trying to bulldoze someone. Missus Peterson, the defendant, shuffled in alone. 76 years old, barely five feet tall, with thinning white hair and hands gnarled from arthritis. All she carried was a weathered Manila folder and the wooden cane she needed to walk. Judge Reynolds called the court to order, and the businessman's attorney launched into their presentation. It seemed airtight. Your honor, our evidence clearly demonstrates Missus Peterson's negligence. The attorney began displaying photographs of the destroyed Mercedes. The damage was extensive. The massive oak had completely flattened the luxury car's roof. They called an arborist to testify. The tree was obviously diseased and structurally compromised for years. He pointed to cross sections showing internal decay. Any responsible property owner would have addressed this hazard long ago. The plaintiff's team presented maintenance estimates totaling 167,000, $84,000 for the total loss Mercedes, $43,000 for damage to a decorative stone wall, and $30,000 for emotional distress. When the businessman took a stand, he spoke with the Confidence of someone unaccustomed to being questioned. I warned Missus Peterson about that hazardous tree at least five times, he testified. I even offered to split the cost of removal, but she refused. Now she claims she can't afford to pay for her negligence, but that's not my problem. Throughout this entire presentation, missus Peterson said nothing. She just sat quietly, occasionally taking careful notes with shaking hands. I remember thinking how hopeless her situation looked. No lawyer, no expert witnesses. Just an elderly woman against a legal steamroller. When her turn came, she slowly rose to her feet, leaning on her cane. The businessman smirked as she shuffled toward the witness stand. The courtroom was silent. Everyone expected a rambling plea for mercy. But Missus Peterson surprised us all. Her voice was soft but clear as she asked if she could question the plaintiff if directly

I helped Mason with his napkin and looked over the menu with him. He pointed at the chicken tenders and smiled. I was about to flag the waiter when Jill leaned over, pulled the bread basket toward Mason, and said, we didn't order for your son, Then my dad added, you should have packed him something if you knew he'd be hungry. Mason's face fell. My mom didn't even glance up. Jill smirked. I realized they weren't going to change, but I could. I waved the waiter over. When he arrived, I stood. Please cancel any orders that haven't been sent to the kitchen. And put everything on my father's Bill. It's his anniversary, after all. You could hear a pin drop. Also, my son will have the rib eye medium rare with truffle Mac and cheese and a Coke. Make it quick. Doug coughed. Jill stared. My Uncle Gary let out a low laugh. The waiter nodded.

The mother's expression hardened. Well, that doesn't help the situation, does it? The boy started kicking the elderly man's seat again, harder. The man winced in pain. Ma'am, your son needs to stop kicking the seat. This gentleman might have back problems. He's 5, she hissed. He has energy, what do you expect? A flight attendant paused. Is there a problem? This child keeps kicking my seat, and I've had recent back surgery, the elderly man explained. Ma'am, please keep your son from kicking the seats. Everyone's attacking me just because my son is a little energetic, the mother protested. As they argued, the boy grabbed my water bottle, unscrewed the cap, and poured water all over my lap. I jumped up soaking wet. Are you kidding me? It was an accident! Don't yell at him! That was not an accident! He looked right at me while he did it. The flight attendant smile disappeared. Ma'am, I need you and your son to come with me. We're not going anywhere. We have rights. A second flight attendant appeared, and after a brief discussion, the first one said, we're moving you to separate seats where your son won't disturb other passengers. Separate? I'm not being separated from my child. Then you both need to move to the back row. Fine! She's snapped. This airline is terrible. I'm never flying with you again! As they moved to the back, the boy screamed, I hate you all! The mother didn't correct him. The flight was peaceful for about an hour. Then a commotion erupted from the back. Flight attendants rushed down the aisle. The boy had opened an overhead bin while his mother was in the bathroom, causing several bags to fall. One had hit a sleeping passenger on the head. When we landed, two airport security officers were waiting at the gate. As I passed their row, the mother was arguing loudly, while the boy sat quietly, looking scared, the first appropriate emotion I'd seen from him the entire flight. I walked past without looking back, finally free from the nightmare that had taught me the true meaning of passenger horror story.

I was on a packed flight to Seattle, squeezed against the window. Just as the doors were closing, a woman rushed on board with a wait about five years old. They stopped at my row, and I immediately felt a sense of dread. The boy pointed at my seat and screamed, I want the window! I want the window! His voice echoed through the cabin. The mother didn't shush him. Instead, she leaned toward me with an entitled smile. Would you mind switching? He'll scream the whole flight if he doesn't get the window. She said it like she was offering me a choice, but her tone made it clear she expected me to move. I'm sorry I specifically booked this, see, I replied. The boy unleashed a scream that made my eardrums vibrate. The mother just shrugged as if to say, see, told you, and took the aisle seat without a something to call him. A flight attendant appeared. Is everything okay here? This person won't give my son the window seat, and now he's upset, the mother said, making it sound like I was bullying a child. The boy started kicking the seat in front of him, where an elderly man sat. The man turned around, clearly in pain. I noticed a cane leaning against his seat. The mother patted her son's leg, but didn't stop him. He'll calm down once we're in the air. We took off with The soundtrack of the boy's sobs. Then I felt something wet hit my arm. The boy was deliberately squeezing his juice box so drops landed on me. She glanced up from her phone. Ethan, don't waste your juice, she said, but made no move to take it away. No apology to me? Nothing. 20 minutes into the flight, the boy unbuckled his seatbelt and stood on his seat. Mother was watching a movie with headphones in. The boy grabbed my book and threw it to the floor. Hey! I said. The mother removed one earbud. What's the problem now? Your son threw my book on the floor. She sighed. Ethan, that's not nice. Say sorry. No, I want the window. She just shrugged and returned to her movie. The elderly man turned around. Would you like to switch seats with me? Before I could answer, the mother jumped in. That would be wonderful.

After a couple of minutes, I told her that she could go home. The party was over because no one showed up. She nodded and walked out the door. Then I was really all alone on my birthday. But about five minutes later, the doorbell suddenly rang. I wiped my tears and answered it. Shelly smiled and asked if it was cool if her brothers and their friends joined my birthday instead. I stared at them confused and her older brother pulled out a bottle of Sprite saying, I hope this is okay instead of a wrapped birthday gift. We didn't really have much time to prepare. I laughed at their silliness and invited them into the house. They sat on the couch and put on the robes and towels, already getting comfortable with the spa themed party. After half an hour, her brother's girlfriends and a few friends arrived as well and brought different chocolatey snacks and an entire tub of ice cream. Things were really looking up because everyone in the room was so genuinely nice and hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing. All night, Maddie's brother sang a few songs together through YouTube Karaoke. Maddie showed off the craziest dance moves ever. And when it was time to blow out the candles, one of the girls brought out a small bottle that looked like alcohol but was actually a non alcoholic soda. She told me to pretend to chug it down while they take a video. So that I had something to brag about to the friends that ditched me. It was a crazy idea, but it definitely did work. The following day, when the Mean Girl crew showed up in front of me to give their excuses and fake apologies, I showed them the video of me chugging down the drink with all the college students yelling chug in the background. I shrugged and told them, well, you missed out on a lot. They watched the video over and over and scrolled through the pictures of the party. They asked me if I was going to host another party and if I could invite those adults too, so that they could also experience a cool adult party. And I said, of course I'll be inviting them because I won't be inviting any of you anymore. They flashed me a snarky look and called me rude before walking away. I didn't care because I received the best gift ever this year, being able to replace fake friends with a genuinely nice bestie named Maddie.

For my 14th birthday, I ended up getting something completely unforgettable by an unexpected friend. I planned on having a super cool slumber party where we would have a spa day at my house. My mom bought extra bath robes, different colored loofahs, MUD mask packs, nail polish kits, and foldable foot water basins. It was seriously so amazing and I made sure to thank my mom over and over for the effort she put into my party. In return, she asked me to invite one of the girls in my neighborhood. I just moved in recently as well because she had no friends yet. I thought about how my friends would react to meeting someone new for my birthday and knew they would be completely against it. I mean, we called ourselves the Mean Girl crew, so we couldn't invite just anyone to join. I asked my mom to reconsider, but she scolded me and said be nice to your neighbors, not just to your friends. Go invite her or there won't be a party at all. I groaned and created an invitation for the random girl at night. I invited all my friends the following day and told them that it was literally going to be the coolest party of the year. They gave me a skeptical look, but still took the invitations and thanked me. They walked away giggling, and I should have known by then that something was Up after school, I stopped by the random girl's house and knocked on the door. Her parents answered the door, so I gave a polite smile and handed over the birthday invitation. I went back home and my mom immediately interrogated me whether I gave an invitation to our neighbor or not. In an annoyed voice, I told her I did and went into my room for some peace and quiet. Two weeks passed and the day was finally here. I was so excited. I had everything prepared, including snacks, and had three boxes of pizza and a cake. I sat in the living room waiting for everyone to show up. The first girl to show up was my neighbor Maddie, who awkwardly said hi and waited with me in the living room. We sat around talking a bit while watching a show on Netflix. After about two hours, no one had shown up yet and I got really worried. I sent a DM to each of my friends, but no one was responding or even opening up my messages. After another hour passed, I knew that they weren't going to show up. I hugged my legs to my chest and put my face to my knees and started crying my eyes out. Maddie patted my back without asking a question, which only made me cry.

When my dad married Cassandra, I was 11. Mom had been gone for 13 months, melanoma that spread faster than anyone expected. One day she was complaining about a headache, and 82 days later, I was standing at her grave in a black dress that still had the tags on. Dad waited exactly one year before bringing Cassandra home. She worked at his investment firm, Client Relations, perfect teeth, blonde hair that never moved, the kind of woman who wore heels to other people's barbecues. She makes me happy again, dad explained, his voice gentle but firm. I need you to try, Emily. So I tried. I helped Cassandra move in, carrying boxes of designer shoes to the closet where Mom's gardening clothes used to hang. I nodded politely when she rearranged our furniture, replacing family photos with abstract art that opened up the space. I even smiled when she transformed Mom's vegetable garden into a meditation patio because growing our own food is so provincial. For three years, I performed the role of grateful stepdaughter. I attended her corporate events wearing the dresses she bought me. I tolerated her friends who cooed about how mature I was. For 14. I kept my grief hidden behind perfect grades and false smiles. Dad didn't notice when I stopped laughing, too busy with Cassandra's social calendar and the new clients she brought In too distracted by their couples retreats and wine club memberships. Meanwhile, I slept with Mom's sweater under my pillow until it stopped smelling like her. Cassandra tried in her way. She bought me expensive birthday gifts, always things she would want. She hosted elaborate dinner parties and introduced me as our daughter to important people who never remembered my name. She even started a college fund for me, making sure everyone knew about her generosity. But when I got my period for the first time, it was Google that taught me what to do. When I had nightmares about mom dying, it was the family dog who comforted me.

They took turns holding my son, except my mom. She smiled and said, I'm saving my arms for my real grandchild. When your brother finally settles down. Two years later, she called me crying. Can I meet him now? The hospital room was full that day. My dad held Jake first, tears in his eyes, my sister next, making baby voices. Even my Aunt Linda, who I barely talk to, got her turn. Then mom walked in with this massive teddy bear. Everyone expected her to reach for him. Instead, she set the bear down, adjusted her scarf, and smiled at me. Oh, wait, she said. Wait for what? My wife asked from the bed. Well, mom glanced at my brother Kevin, who was standing by the window. When Kevin finally settles down and has kids, I'll have more energy. Then. I'm saving my arms for my real grandchild. The room went silent. Not awkward silent. Nuclear silent. My wife's face went pale. My sister started to say something, but dad touched her arm. Even Kevin looked uncomfortable. Mom, I said slowly, Jake is your real grandchild. She waved her hand. You know what I mean. Kevin's more established, better job, better apartment. When he has kids, it'll be more official. I was 28. Kevin was 31 and single. But apparently his hypothetical future children were more real than my actual breathing son. After that, nothing. No calls. On Jake's first birthday, No Christmas presents. My sister would send updates in the family chat, and mom would react with hearts, but radio silence to me. Meanwhile, she posted on Facebook about can't wait to be a grandma someday. With pictures of baby clothes she was collecting for the future. My wife wanted to confront. I said, no. Some people show you exactly who they are, and you just have to believe them. Then two years passed. Kevin got engaged to this woman named Michelle. Mom went into overdrive. Wedding planning, venue tours, the whole thing. She'd video call me just to show me cake samples. Never once asking to see Jake in the background. Three months before the wedding, Kevin called me. Michelle left.

Then I saw them tagged at a concert in another state. I didn't say a word. But a week later, they Learned what real pain feels like. I was 26 when they found the tumor, benign, but it had to come out. Brain surgery, the kind where they shave half your head and you sign papers that list death as a possible outcome. I called mom. First surgery scheduled for Thursday. I know it's short notice, but, oh, honey. Her voice dropped. We really want to be there, but flights from Phoenix are $400 each right now with your father's medication costs. Just can't swing it. I sat there holding the phone, staring at my apartment wall. It's okay. I understand. You're so strong, sweetie. You'll do great. We'll be thinking of you. My roommate, Becca, offered to be my emergency contact. I said yes because there was nobody else. Surgery day came. They wheeled me in at 6:00am. I remember the anesthesiologist telling me to count backward from 10. I made it to 7. When I woke up, the room was spinning. Half my head was wrapped in bandages. A vision was blurry in one eye. A nurse checked my vitals and asked if I needed anything. Is anyone here for me? She checked her chart. No visitors listed. Becca showed up during her lunch break with a sandwich she knew I couldn't eat. She Stayed for 20 minutes, held my hand, then had to get back to work. That night, I couldn't sleep. The morphine made everything foggy, but not enough to stop a headache. Picked up my phone, scrolling through nothing, just trying to distract myself. That's when I saw it. Dad's Facebook posted two hours ago, tagged at a Metallica concert in Denver. I clicked the photo. Mom was there too. Both of them front row holding up beers, faces lit up with stage lights. Dad's arm around her shoulder. Mom's caption, best anniversary surprise ever, 30 years with this man. My hands started shaking, not from the surgery. I opened a new tab, searched flights from Phoenix to Denver, $180 round trip. Same dates next to Boston where I lived, $380 round trip. I did the math in my head, even though it made my skull throb. Two concert tickets, probably $200 each. Minimum beers at the venue, $15 each. Hotel room for the night. They'd spent over a grand on Metallica. I put the phone face down on the hospital bed, stared at the ceiling tiles, counted them, lost track, started over. I didn't call, didn't comment on the photo, didn't text. Nurse came back an hour later. You okay, honey? Your heart rate is elevated. I'm fine. Two days later, they discharged me. Becca picked me up, helped me into her car, drove me home. She cleaned my room, put fresh sheets on my bed, stocked my fridge with Soup and Gatorade. You didn't have to do this, I said. Yeah, I did. Someone has to. That afternoon, mom called. I almost didn't answer. Hey, sweetie, how'd everything go? Fine. Oh, that's wonderful. We were so worried. Your father barely slept that night. He kept saying he wished we could have been there. I looked at my reflection in the bathroom mirror. Half my head was still bandaged. The visible part of my scalp was shaved. She's running along my temple. I'm sure he did. You sound tired. Are they giving you good pain medication? Yeah. Well, get some rest. We love you so much. Call us if you need anything, okay? Okay. She didn't ask about the bandages, the recovery time, whether I could walk without getting dizzy. She didn't ask if I was scared or in pain or if I needed help. Three days post up, sitting on my couch with an ice pack against my head, I made my decision. I opened Facebook. So liked the one photo the hospital photographer had taken, me in the bed, bandage wrapped around my skull. Giving a weak thumbs up because that's what you do when someone points a camera at you. I typed the caption carefully. Surgery went well. Grateful for Becca who was there since family couldn't make it. Sometimes friends are the family you choose. Posted it public. Then I went back to Dad's concert photo, one with him and mom grinning, beers raised very clearly. Dated the same day as my surgery. I shared it to my timeline. No caption, didn't need one. Within 30 minutes, my phone started ringing. Mom, Dad, Mom again, dad, my aunt, my grandmother. I turned my phone off and took a nap. When I woke up four hours later, I had.

Friday came, and I was nervous. I'd accepted that maybe a handful of us would go through with it and that I'd probably be caught. But when I walked into school, my jaw dropped. Tank tops everywhere. Hallways filled with exposed shoulders. Guys, girls, everyone. Even the football team showed up in cutoffs. Some teachers stared in disbelief. Others avoided eye contact. The assistant principal tried to stop a group of seniors at the door, but they just smiled and walked past him. By second period, it was obvious there were too many of us. They couldn't suspend everyone. We got through the day. No one was punished. But the principal was furious. She called an emergency assembly at the end of the day, stood on stage fuming, demanding that whoever ran the Instagram come forward immediately or face serious consequences. Silence filled the auditorium. And then, out of nowhere, Miss Reynolds, our AP English teacher, stood up in the back. I run the account, she said, clear as day. The entire room gasped. Even I was stunned. She walked down the aisle all calm and collected and said, this dress code is sexist. I'm tired of watching female students be humiliated while their male peers are left alone. Principal didn't know what to say. She sputtered something about professionalism and investigation, but it was already too late. The entire student body was on their feet, cheering. What no one knew except me was That Miss Reynolds was bluffing. She didn't run the account. She didn't even follow it. She just had my back. The next day, the school board announced they were forming a committee to review and revise the dress code with student and faculty input. That Monday in class, Miss Reynolds handed back my essay with a smile. As she passed my desk, she leaned in just a little and whispered, nice Instagram skills. She knew all along.

Junior year I hit my limit with our school's ridiculous dress code. It always felt targeted. Tank tops, shorts above fingertip length, anything remotely distracting, instant violation. But only for girls. Meanwhile, guys strolled through the halls and sagging jeans and muscle tees with no issue. It wasn't just annoying, it was humiliating. I've seen friends pulled out of class, shamed in front of everyone, made to change or sit in the office over a strap being too thin. I decided I wasn't going to just complain anymore. I was going to do something. I made an anonymous Instagram account called at dress code violators and asked students to DM photos showing violations that weren't punished, specifically of guys wearing banned items with zero consequences. Within days the DM started flooding in. Hoodies and gym ripped jeans and class us guys with tank tops in the lunch room. I started posting side by sides. A girl dress coded for a spaghetti strap next to a guy wearing the same thing without issue. Then more stories. A girl written up for shorts while a guy in even shorter athletic ones passed by unnoticed. The account went viral in school like wildfire. Everyone was talking about it. Even students who never cared about dress code stuff were checking it daily. Teachers were whispering in the halls trying to figure out who was behind it. Some accused each other. The principal made a formal announcement. Over the P A. Anyone found to be behind the account would face suspension. They were calling it targeted harassment and a violation of school policy. That's when I launched Phase 2. I designed a simple flyer for a dress code protest that said, this Friday, everyone wears a tank top. No excuses. I printed over 300 copies and taped them in bathrooms, tucked them in lockers, slid them into textbooks in the library. I posted a countdown on the Instagram tank top Friday let's

The thing is, nobody in my family goes gray early. My dad's 52 and still has brown hair. My grandma didn't get her first gray until she was 60. This silver patch made no sense. Emma was so shaken. She asked if I wanted to stop the process, but I was curious now. I told her to keep going. As she continued bleaching, more silver patches appeared. They were all in different spots, like someone had randomly painted streaks throughout my hair. Emma kept muttering about how this wasn't normal, how hair doesn't just turn silver like that. She'd done thousands of color removals and never seen anything close to this. The other stylists started gathering around my chair. Soon half the salon was staring at my head like I was some kind of science experiment. One of them took pictures to show her instructor at cosmetology school. Emma was getting more freaked out by the minute. Her hands were actually shaking as she worked. Then Patricia remembered something. She asked if I'd ever had an MRI or any medical scans. I told her, yeah, I'd had an MRI about three years ago after a car accident. She nodded. Like that explained everything. Apparently, sometimes the contrast dye they use can get trapped in hair follicles and change the color permanently. But Emma wasn't buying it. She said she'd worked on clients who'd had MRIs and never seen this. She kept Saying my hair looked like it belonged on someone 80 years old, not 24. The silver was so bright and pure, nothing like normal gray hair. It had this weird shine to it that caught the light in a way that looked almost supernatural. By the time we finished, About 60% of my hair was this stunning silver color. The rest was my natural brown. Emma refused to charge me the full price because she said she'd never done anything like this before and wasn't sure if she'd damaged my hair somehow. She gave me her personal number and made me promise to call if anything weird happened. I left the salon feeling like a total freak. People on the street were staring at my hair. Some random woman at the grocery store asked if it was a wig. A kid pointed at me and asked his mom why my hair looked like a robots. I started wearing hats everywhere.

So I've been going to the salon for like two years, getting my hair dyed black every six weeks. My colorist, Emma, was always super confident, talking about how she could handle any hair challenge. She'd seen me through blonde highlights, red streaks, you name it. But this time I wanted to go completely natural for my cousin's wedding. I sat in her chair that Tuesday morning and told her I wanted all the dye stripped out. Emma just nodded and said it would take a few sessions but totally doable. She mixed up the strong bleach solution and started sectioning my hair. Everything seemed normal at first. He was chatting about her weekend plans, asking about my job, the usual salon talk. But then she got to the back section of my hair, the part that grows slowest. I was looking at my phone when I heard her gasp, like actually gasp out loud. I looked up in the mirror and her face had gone completely pale. She was staring at my scalp with this horrified expression. I asked what was wrong and she just pointed at the back of my head without saying anything. I couldn't see what she was looking at, but she grabbed this little hand mirror and angled it so I could see there growing from my roots was bright silver hair, not gray, not white. But actual metallic silver like you'd see on a coin. Emma backed away from my chair and asked how old I was. I told her 24, and she just shook her head. She'd never seen anything like it. The silver was only in that one section, maybe two inches wide, but it was so bright it almost looked fake, like someone had painted my roots with metallic paint. She called over the salon owner, this older woman named Patricia, who'd been doing hair for 30 years. Patricia took one look and immediately asked if I had any medical conditions. I told her, no, perfectly healthy. She started asking weird questions, like if I'd been exposed to chemicals at work.

Instead of talking to the actual guy she was supposed to marry in four weeks, I typed two words into the live chat, don't bother. Then I started canceling wedding venue, caterer, coordinator, professional, polite emails. One after another, I copied our wedding spreadsheet to my drive, then removed Dora's access. Four months of planning locked away in seconds. Within an hour, my phone exploded. Lexi calling in panic. What did you do? Dora just got an email from the venue. WTF is going on? I put my phone on silent. Dora called 53 times. The voicemail cycled through every emotion. Fusion, anger, bargaining, more anger than entitled rage. When she showed up Friday afternoon dragging her suitcase still in her bachelorette clothes, she was shaking with indignation. You have five minutes to explain yourself. Explain what? I looked up for my book. You asked a question, I gave you an answer. Then I acted on it. It was a joke. I was having fun with my friends. Was it a joke when you called me boring and pathetic to hundreds of strangers? When you complained about our intimate life? What about Marcus? Her face went white. She'd forgotten the full extent of her performance. You humiliated me. You commented for everyone to see. You were broadcasting to hundreds of strangers. The humiliation started when you held up our relationship for public ridicule and confessed to cheating. I just ended the Show. Her father. Isaac called later. He'd heard Dora's version that I had a breakdown over harmless jokes. I sent him the recording. He called back an hour later, voice completely different. Jesus Christ, Damien. I just watched it. I'm so sorry. I had no idea she could be that cruel. What she did wasn't just dramatic. That was deliberately cruel. His voice cracked. I raised her better than that. Four months later, her dad cut her off financially. She and Lexi had a massive fight. Turns out going live was Lexi's idea and Lexi kicked her out. The company fired both her and Marcus after I sent HR. The recording of her workplace affair confession. Last week, I booked that Italy honeymoon solo, sold the engagement ring and bought myself a new gaming monitor with the money.

I wanna have fun before settling with someone safe like you. So I gave her all the freedom she wanted and lived my life without her. Months later, she, Tiffany and I had spent four solid years building what I thought was something real. We were that couple everyone wanted to be. Weekend trips, actual conversations, genuine partnership. I've been planning to propose within months. Then around year three, things shifted. Started showing me Instagram posts from her single friends, hitting clubs with this wistful tone. Her sister Ruth and her 23 year old coworker Brianna started filling her head with stories about experiencing everything before settling down. The breaking point came on a Tuesday night in March. She sat me down with that rehearsed speech about never really living and needing to experience being young and free before settling with someone safe like me. I think we should take a break, she said. Not forever, just until I figure this out. I need to know what else is out there so I can come back to you with no regrets. She wanted six months, maybe a year, to test drive other men while I waited around to see if I made the. So it's a breakup with the option to come back if your better plans don't work out? I said if you really loved me, you'd want me to be sure about us. I looked at this woman I've been planning to propose to in three weeks. The ring was literally 20 feet away in my sock drawer. Okay, I said, you want space? Got it. Take all the time you need. She left that night. The next day I returned that 8 thousand dollar engagement ring and use the money to build the ultimate gaming setup. I got a German Shepherd mix I named Ziggy. Always wanted a dog, but Tiffany claimed she was allergic. She wasn't. She just didn't want the responsibility. For the first time in months, I felt relief. No more walking on eggshells. I joined a boxing gym where I met Tommy the firefighter, Marcus the software engineer and Big Jim the construction foreman. Started lifting seriously, eating right. The transformation was obvious within months. Meanwhile, Tiffany documented her self discovery on Instagram, posts from clubs with Brianna and Derek from her office. According to Ruth, who started calling to fish for information, Tiffany was confused about why I seemed so happy without her. Derek lasted three weeks before for ghosting her, then showed up at a company happy hour making out with a twenty two year old intern. After Derek came Brad, the personal trainer who critiqued her food choices and openly flirted with other women. Then Troy, the creative soul who borrowed money on dates and got caught hooking up with one of her friends. She'd brag to everyone about how much better life was without Boring. Predictable. Me. Three months in, I met Haley at the gym. Veterinarian, 30, small art, funny. She had her own life, her own hobbies, and turned out to be a gamer who could trash talk better than most guys I knew. When Tiffany saw my Instagram post from a hiking trip with Haley and Ziggy, my phone exploded with messages about who this basic girl was and how I was seriously dating some random gym girl instead of working on us. Six months after Tiffany left, she called wanting dinner to have a real conversation about us. She launched into her prepared speech about how

Her dad flew back screaming, you fired who? Our lead investor called an emergency meeting. He just pointed to my name on their funding documents. He looked at the board and asked quietly, so do you want to pay the 45 million dollar fine or just hand over the company? So this happened three weeks ago and I'm still processing it. I've been with Tech Core Systems for 14 years. Started as a junior analyst, worked my way up to senior operations director. I literally helped build this company from 20 employees in a cramped office to over 500 people across three states. The founder, Richard Palmer was an amazing boss, smart, fair, actually listen to people. But last year he decided to semi retire and handed the CEO position to his daughter Madison. She was 26, fresh out of business school and had exactly zero experience running anything except her Instagram account. First thing Madison did, hired her college friends. Her new c 0 0 was this guy named Brett who wore designer suits and called everyone chief. Within months, the culture went from collaborative to toxic. But I kept my head down and did my job. Then last Tuesday, Madison called me into the office. Brett was there with two interns all smirking like they knew something I didn't. Madison didn't even look up from her phone. Jessica, we're streamlining, cutting legacy costs. You've been here since like the Dinosaur. Age, right. She slid a folder across the desk. Here's your Severance. Security will escort you out in 10 minutes. I just stood there calm because here's what Madison didn't know. 12 years ago when we raised our Series B funding, I was in those negotiations. Lead investor Horizon Capital wanted Protection clauses. Their lawyer and I spent weeks drafting an agreement that protected both sides. One clause specifically named me as essential operational personnel. It meant if I was terminated without cause, the investor could trigger penalty clauses. I never told anyone because it seemed like overkill at the time. Just lawyers.

And they finally Learned what she left them with. I married my husband when his twins were eight. Their mom had walked out two years earlier, leaving nothing but a note that said she needed to find herself. No calls, no birthday cards, nothing but to hear the kids talk. She was a saint who'd been driven away. Every family dinner was a war zone. I'd cook their favorites and they'd push the plates away. Your meatloaf tastes weird. Real mom made it better. I'd help with homework and get accused of doing it wrong. Real mom was smarter. I bought them new clothes and heard how real mom had better taste. My husband would just sigh and say they needed time to adjust. Time, like three years wasn't enough. The breaking point came on their 11th birthday. I'd spent weeks planning, decorating the house, baking a cake from scratch, inviting all their friends. When they walked in and saw the decorations, my stepdaughter started crying, you ruined it. Real mom always took us to that fancy restaurant. You're trying too hard to be her and you'll never be. I looked at my husband. He wouldn't meet my eyes. The party went on, forced smiles and whispered complaints. That night, after everyone left, I made a decision. If I'd never be their real mom, I'd stop pretending to be any kind of mom at all. The Next morning, I moved my things to the guest room. I stopped cooking family dinners and made meals for just myself. They could fend for themselves or their dad could handle it. I stopped doing their laundry, stopped helping with homework, stopped driving them to activities. I stopped buying them things. I became a polite roommate in my own house. My husband was furious. You're acting like a child. They're kids. They don't know better. But I was done. Your kids made it clear I'm not their mother, so I'm not going to act like one. You wanted a wife. You got one. You wanted a mom for your kids. You should have married someone they'd actually accept. The first week, they barely noticed. By week 2, the complaint started. There's no food in the house. Why isn't my uniform clean? I need a ride to soccer practice. I'd smile politely. Ask your dad or maybe call your real mom since she's so wonderful. Week 3, my stepdaughter's big school project was due. She'd always left things to the last minute because I'd swoop in and help. Not anymore. She failed and came home crying. My husband tried to blame me. You could have reminded her, I shrugged. Real mom would have remembered. Then came the phone call that changed everything. It was a Thursday evening, one month into my strike. The doorbell rang and my husband answered. I heard raised voices, shocked gasps. A woman's voice I didn't recognize. But the kids did. They came running down the stairs screaming, Mom, mom, you came back. I walked into the living room and saw her, their real mom, standing in the doorway with a designer purse.

So I made sure her next family reunion exposed everything. I was 23 when the endometriosis diagnosis came. Three surgeries later, biological children weren't in my future. I told my dad and tried to move on. At Thanksgiving, my stepmom decided it was everyone's business. My. My cousin announced her pregnancy. My stepmom raised her wine glass and said, loud enough for all 17 relatives to hear, well, at least some of us can carry on the family name properly. She looked directly at me. It's such a shame when someone can't contribute to the family legacy. Makes you wonder if they're really part of the family at all. My dad just stared at his plate. He'd married her three years ago after my mom died. That became her weapon. At every gathering, she'd mention it. Oh, we're talking about grandchildren. Well, some of us won't be providing any. My dad gave apologetic looks, but never said a word. Christmas, she announced she was pregnant at 39. She spent the evening rubbing her belly and talking about real blood family and continuing the pure family line. That's when I started digging. I found her ex husband on Facebook. We talked for three hours. She'd cleaned out their joint accounts while he visited his dying mother, filed a restraining order based on fabricated abuse claims, took the house. He'd lost everything, including custody of his daughter, because she Convinced the judge he was dangerous. He had evidence. Bank statements, text messages, affidavits from neighbors who'd witnessed her screaming at him. I kept digging. Three previous marriages, same pattern. Then I found her daughter, the one she'd given up at 19 and never mentioned. I found her through adoption registries. She was 20 now and had been searching for years. I verified everything three times. Then I planned. Family reunion was in July at my uncle's lakehouse. My stepmom spent weeks planning it, determined to show off her pregnancy. I R S V P ed for two. She was holding court by the pool, one hand on her belly, surrounded by relatives. My dad stood beside her. I walked up with my guest. The crowd parted. My stepmom's face went white. This is my sister, I announced loudly. Her daughter from her first pregnancy, the one she's never mentioned. Her daughter turned to our stepmom. I've been looking for you for three years. I just wanted to know why you gave me up. My stepmom stammered. That's not. I don't. You must be mistaken. I pulled out my folder and started passing around documents. Bank statements from her second marriage showing theft. Police reports from her third marriage proving her abuse allegations were dismissed. Text messages where she told her friend she was only in it for the money. And medical records showing she'd had her tubes tied four years ago. The pregnancy was a lie. The bump was Padding.

Stop being a bitter bitch just because you're still single. Then her and Marvin went away, mumbling about how I wasn't right in the head. After that confrontation, I kept my distance, focusing my lens on the reception. But during the father daughter dance, my viewfinder caught something that changed everything Marvin and the maid of honor kissing passionately behind the gazebo. I switched to my longer lens and spent 20 minutes documenting their affair. Having fun? I asked Marvin when he emerged disheveled. His face went white seeing my camera. Gemma doesn't need to know, he stammered. You're right, she doesn't need to. She deserves to, I replied. But instead of causing a scene, I kept filming. My camera had captured everything Gemma screaming at her grandmother for walking too slow, calling her mother a pathetic cow over flowers, vomiting on her dress while counting gift envelopes, slapping Marvin when he mentioned a female co worker. At night's end, Gemma extended her hand for the memory cards like I was surrendering stolen property. Here's the card with your formal portraits, I said sweetly, handing her one card while keeping four others. I knew you'd come through, she sneered. Though your work better be worth the food we wasted on you. I looked her straight in the eye. Everyone's going to see exactly what your wedding was worth. She was too drunk to understand, turning to tell her bridesmaids, the help is Finally leaving at 3 a m. From my apartment, I emailed everything. The unedited album titled Gemma's Wedding The Truth to every Guest, both families, her employer, her clients, and Marvin's Law firm. The time stamps for each photo. By 7:00am, my phone had exploded. Gemma called 10 times before I finally answered. What the f did you do? She screamed. I photographed your wedding, I said calmly, just like you asked. You vindictive bitch! You ruined everything! No, Gemma. You did that when you treated me like hired help after I gifted you $4,000 of work. Marvin grabbed the phone and take them down now, or I'll sue you. Sue me for what? Taking photos you asked me to take? For documenting your affair with a maid of honor? The line went dead. Gemma's mother called next, threatening legal action until I reminded her about the photos of her daughter calling her pathetic. The maid of honor's fiance called, thanking me for showing him the truth. Gemma showed up at my apartment at noon, pounding on my door, mascara streaming. I thought we were friends. So did I, I said through the door, friends don't humiliate friends in front of everyone. She sobbed. You're right, Gemma. You are absolutely right.

When I arrived, I discovered she told everyone I was the paid help and couldn't eat with guests. Gemma and I had been friends since college. When she asked me to photograph her wedding for free, I initially quoted my standard rate of $4,000, but she gasped and said, I thought we were best friends. Real friends don't charge each other. She then started crying about wedding stress and budget problems, promising I'd be her guest of honour, sitting at the head table celebrating as her best friend who just happened to a camera. Against my better judgment, I agreed to photograph her wedding. The morning of the wedding, when the catering manager tried directing me to the kitchen, I marched straight to Gemma in her bridal suite. What the hell is this about me eating in the kitchen? I demanded. She barely looked up from her phone, saying, well, you are working, aren't you? It would look weird if the photographer was eating with guests. I reminded her of our agreement and she rolled her eyes. God, don't be so dramatic. Just do this one thing for me on my day. I stormed out of the bridal suite, but Gemma's mother immediately intercepted me in the hallway, pressing a vendor meal ticket into my hand. The kitchen staff will call you when it's time to eat. I handed it back firmly. I'm Gemma's Best friend and a guest. There's been a misunderstanding. Her mother's face went hold. Gemma specifically told me, you're the hired help. Don't make a scene at my daughter's wedding. During the ceremony, as I photographed from the aisle, Gemma's cousin leaned over and asked loudly, are you the budget photographer Gemma found on Craigslist? Before Gemma could respond from the altar, I announced, actually, I'm the professional photographer doing this as a wedding gift that would normally cost four grand. Gemma's face flushed red and her smile froze. Between the ceremony and reception, while photographing the wedding party, I overheard Gemma telling her bridesmaids she charged her parents $3,000 for photography, pocketing the money since she got me to work for free. So what? She snapped when I confronted her. You can afford it with all your fancy clients. Her maid of honour laughed about Gemma selling today's prince workers for $75 each as exclusive professional photography. I'm watermarking everything with my business logo and rates, I declared. Gemma grabbed my arm hard enough to leave marks. You will not ruin this for me. At cocktail hour, Marvin the groom, cornered me. He was drunk and tried sliding his hand down my back. Gemma told me about your desperate financial situation, he said, trying to imply something disgusting. I snapped loudly, get your hands off me, Marvin, or I'll tell everyone about Vegas! Gemma saw

I responded, understood. Two days later, their lawyer reached out to me in a panic. I've been the family's financial backbone for nearly 4 years. I paid their 1,800 dollar monthly mortgage like clockwork, plus utilities, insurance, emergency repairs, everything. My name, my credit, my money. They never said thank you. My sister Marissa was always in crisis. Credit card maxed out. I paid it. Car repairs, I covered it. Daycare costs, I sent cash until she figured it out. Three years later, she was still figuring it out. I never said no because I thought this was what family did until I Learned it was exactly what they expected. The first crack appeared while scrolling Facebook. There was Marissa, my parents and the kids in front of the house I was paying for, holding a Home Sweet Home sign. The caption, so proud of our daughter for building a future we can all share. This home is in the right hands. No acknowledgement of me, no tag, no gratitude, just them smiling on a porch I had paid for. Days later, I called the bank. Mortgage was still in my name, but there was a request to change the primary contact to Miss Marissa Harper. Then I found $2,400 missing from my account, transferred to Marissa's emergency card. When confronted, she said, don't make this a thing, Jordan. We needed groceries. I assumed we were still sharing that card. My Mother's response, Marissa is going through a lot. Let's not fight over a few dollars. Few dollars for me. Disaster for Marissa when she missed a phone payment. The family group chat became worse. Someone posted a meme of a man handing over his wallet. Big Brother Energy, pay now, ask never. My cousin tag Jordan. Another, can you cover my student loans too, my father? Only if you name your child after him to keep the donor happy. Nobody defended me. But the final blow came while mowing their backyard. The kitchen window was open and I heard my mother and Marissa talking. Marissa laughed. Did you see his face when I told Aunt Karen the house was mine? He didn't even blink like a puppy, just happy to sniff the plate. Mom giggled. Once the paperwork goes through, he won't be able to say anything. Then Marissa delivered the killing blow. Mom, he's not family anymore. He's just a sponsor. I stood there letting those words sink in. Not family as a sponsor. Three weeks later came the invitation for my mother's 60th birthday, 60 guests, full catering, a legacy event. I didn't rsvp, I just prepared. I printed everything, $311,115 and 84 total contributions with dates and bank records. I saved the audio of their conversation and screenshots of the group chat mockery. I arrived 15 minutes late. During the speeches about sacrifice and love, this screen showed the house with built with love, passed down with Purpose, no mention of me. My mother took the microphone. I'm proud of Marissa. She's shown what legacy truly means. This home will stay in the right hands. I stood up and walked to the microphone. Since we're talking about legacy, let's do the.

We went to court, and I won. The judge looked at their claims, looked at my evidence, and dismissed the case in under 20 minutes. He even made a comment about wasting the court's time. I thought that nightmare was finally over. Then last week, John's sister found me on Instagram under a fake account. She sent me a long message saying she just got engaged, but her boyfriend can't afford a ring. She said since I'm not engaged anymore, I should give her John's ring so it can actually be used for a wedding instead of sitting in my jewelry box. When I said no, she lost it. She started messaging me from different numbers, different social media accounts, even had her friends contact me, saying I was selfish and heartless. My phone was on the table during lunch with my friend Sarah when another message popped up. Sarah read it and asked what was going on. I explained everything, and she got quiet. Then she said maybe I should just give the ring to his sister, that it would mean more to someone who's actually getting married. She told our other friends, and now they're all saying the same thing. That I'm being petty, that I should move on and let the family have the ring. I started doubting myself. Maybe they were Right. Maybe I was holding onto something I didn't need anymore. But then yesterday, I found out the truth. One of John's co workers reached out to me. He said he'd heard about the court case and wanted me to know something. John had life insurance through his job policy. Worth $40,000. It went directly to his parents. The funeral cost 18,000. I did some digging. John's parents own a property management company. They have rental houses all over town. His dad drives a BMW. They're not rich, but they're definitely not broke. They were never struggling to pay for the funeral. They lied to me while I was grieving. Took my money, and then tried to take the one thing I had left of John. And now I know why. They really wanted the ring back. They were planning to sell it.

John died three months after proposing. We were supposed to get married in August. Instead, I planned his funeral in March. His parents called me two days after the accident, crying, saying they couldn't afford a proper service. I didn't even think twice. I emptied our wedding account, the one we've been building together for two years. Every penny we'd save for the venue, the catering, the photographer, all of it went to giving John the funeral he deserved. The morning after we buried him, I was still in the black dress from the service when his brother knocked on my door. He didn't ask how I was doing. He just said he needed the ring back. I was confused. I asked him why, and he looked me straight in the eye and said the ring had been in their family for five generations. Pass down from their great, great, great grandparents. He said it belonged to the family, not to me. I told him that was impossible. I was there when John bought it. We went to this jewelry store that makes some pieces inspired by fantasy movies. John picked out the design, paid for it with his credit card, and proposed that same night. The ring was two sizes too big, so we went back the next week and exchanged it for the right size. I still had the receipt. With both transactions, John's signature, everything. His brother's face turned red. He called me a liar and said I must have faked the paperwork. Then he stormed out. Within an hour, my phone wouldn't stop buzzing. John's mom, his dad, add his sister, his aunts. All of them calling and texting, saying I stole a family heirloom. They said I was dishonoring John's memory by keeping something that wasn't mine. I blocked most of them, but. And I got a letter from a lawyer. They were suing me for the ring, and they were demanding I reimburse them for the funeral costs. Because apparently, I had no right to plan it without their permission. I couldn't believe it. I paid for everything. The casket, the flowers, the burial plot, all of it. And now they wanted me to pay them back. I hired a lawyer and showed him everything. The receipt from the jewelry store with the date and John's name. The exchange paperwork showing we swapped sizes, photos I'd taken.

I offered to sign one anyway. I wasn't marrying him for money. Three months ago, I found out I was pregnant with twins. Mike insisted on announcing it at a family gathering. When we did, everyone congratulated us except Kayla and my mother in law, who stared daggers at me. Kayla had been trying to get pregnant for years. But was infertile. Mike's family tried convincing her to adopt, but she refused, saying she didn't want to raise a kid from the streets. When Mike's relatives asked about baby showers, Kayla burst out crying and locked herself in the bathroom. After 30 minutes, she came out and told me I should have talked to her first. My mother in law said I was selfish and made everything about me. Suddenly, Kayla became unusually kind. Both she and my mother in law started calling regularly, sending flowers with cards saying can't wait to see the twins. Kayla even offered to throw my baby shower, which she organized perfectly. The day of the shower, I excused myself to use the bathroom. Coming out, I heard my husband and mother in law arguing in hushed tones in the hallway. My mother in law asked Mike if he'd talked to me yet about their plan with the twins. Mike told her to lower her voice, but she said he needed to man up. Then she said it clearly. He needed to discuss this before the twins were born. Otherwise they wouldn't be able to give one of the twins to Kayla on time for her 27th birthday. She reminded him he'd already agreed, and she's been looking forward to getting a child for months now. They were planning to give away one of my babies as a birthday gift. I stood frozen as they discussed it like it was normal. Mike kept saying He was working on it, and it wasn't an easy conversation. I waited for them to finish.

I did. Days later, her father stormed into her house screaming, do you know what he just did? She didn't even look up from her phone when she said it. Just a casual go ahead, move out, like she was giving me permission to grab coffee. I could see her new guy's name lighting up her screen every few seconds. Sean. Of course, his name was Sean. You've been miserable here anyway, she added, still scrolling. We both know this hasn't been working. I didn't argue, didn't beg, just walked to the bedroom and started packing. Same duffle bag I'd used when I moved in seven years ago, back when her family actually pretended to respect me. She got louder as I folded shirts, talking to herself but making sure I could hear. You'll land on your feet or maybe not. That little laugh at the end, the one that cuts deep better than any insult. When I zip a bag and walked back through the kit Cooper, she looked up with mock surprise. You're actually going, you told me to. My voice was flat. I let the door closed behind me without looking back. What she forgot, what her whole entitled family forgot was that their boutique hotel, the 20 room property her father loves bragging about runs entirely on a booking system I built from scratch six years ago. Not just any system, custom platform I spent eight months developing Handling everything from reservations to inventory to automated guest communications. It's sophisticated, proprietary and licensed under my software company's name. When we were happy, I gave them a sweetheart deal, $500 a month for software that would cost them 15 grand anywhere else. Over six years, I'd save them over $1 million. They'd grown comfortable. Father strutted around town talking about our family business like he'd built it all himself, forgetting the tech guy who made it actually function. I gave it three days. Then I sent the email. Professional, courteous, completely airtight, 30 days notice to turn, terminate the licensing agreement. They could migrate to a new system or pay market rate, $12,000 per month plus a $50,000 setup fee. Their family lawyer called within an hour, voice tight with panic. You can't just pull the software. We have contracts. Check section 7, sub section 3, I said calmly. Either party may.

For my entire childhood, my family had this group chat. Mom, dad, my older brother Tyler, and my younger sister Mia. Everyone except me. I found out when I was 16. I walked into the kitchen, and they were all laughing about something. When I asked what was funny, they got quiet. Tyler slipped and said it was just something in the chat. What chat? My mom tried to play it off, oh, just a silly family thing. You know how it is. But I didn't know because I wasn't in it. I thought maybe it was a mistake, so I asked my dad to add me later. He said, sure, honey, but he never did. Then I started noticing things. They'd all go to dinner on random Tuesdays, take weekend trips I only heard about after my sister got concert tickets from the family chat. My brother knew about my cousin's wedding three months before I did. Every single time I asked to be included, they'd say, oh, yeah, we'll add you, and then just wouldn't. I tried bringing it up seriously. Once sat my mom down and said, it really hurts that I'm not in the family chat. She laughed. Actually laughed. Sweetheart, you're so sensitive. It's just a group chat. Just a group chat where they planned literally everything without me. My dad said I was making a big Deal out of nothing. Tyler told me to stop being weird about it. Mia said you wouldn't even use it anyway. But how would they know? They never gave me the chance. Last year, my brother got engaged. I found out three weeks later when I saw the photos on Facebook. Three weeks? It all known the night it happened because he announced it in the chat. When I confronted him, he said, I figured someone told you. Nobody did, because nobody thought about me. Then came my mom's birthday last month. I showed up at her house with flowers and a gift I'd spent two hours picking out. When I walked in, they were all dressed up, grabbing their coats. Oh, my mom said, looking genuinely surprised to see me. We're just heading out to dinner. What dinner? She glanced at my dad. The reservation for my birthday. Nobody told me about a reservation. Tyler jumped in. We thought you were busy. I wasn't busy. I was never busy. They just didn't tell me. My sister said it was in the chat. Like that explained everything. I stood there holding flowers in a gift bag, watching my entire family awkwardly shuffle toward the door. My mom gave me this pitying smile. We can do something next week, just the two of us. I left the flowers on the counter and walked out. That's when I decided I was done asking. Christmas came around and I didn't reach out. Didn't Ask about plans. Didn't text to confirm anything. Just waited. Two days before Christmas. My sister texted you coming to mom and Dad's on the 25th? I said I wasn't invited. She sent me a screenshot from the group chat. The one I'm still not in. Where they've been planning for weeks. Menu, who is bringing what, what time to arrive. Everything. I stared at that screenshot for a long time. Then I replied, let me know when there's a chat I'm actually part of. She tried calling. I decline.

She laughed and said, you're going away. For a long time, she didn't realize the house was still legally mine. And the officer she called was my brother. He just looked at her and said, ma'am, you might want to call your lawyer. I'm standing on what used to be our porch when Vanessa opens the door with this twisted smile plastered across her face. The kind of smile that says she's been planning this moment. She announces, already pulling out her phone to dial 9 1 1. I warned you to stay away from my property. Your property? I ask, keeping my voice calm. Vanessa, I just came to get my tools from the garage. We agreed. We agreed to nothing. She cuts me off, her finger hovering over the call button. You're trespassing, and now you're going to jail. I'd moved out three weeks ago after our breakup got nasty. I've been staying at my parents place, trying to figure out the next steps. The house, the one I bought two years before we even met, was supposed to be sorted out through lawyers. Vanessa had been stalling, refusing to move out, claiming she had tenant rights. Today, I'd simply come to collect my power tools from the garage. I texted her that morning to let her know. She'd responded with, fine, whatever. But apparently she'd had other plans. She presses the button. I can hear The dispatcher's voice through the speaker 911, what's your emergency? Yes, my ex boyfriend just broke into my house, Vanessa says, her voice suddenly shaking, theatrical. I'm terrified. Please send someone quickly. He's very aggressive. I just stand there, hands in my pockets, waiting. Because here's what Vanessa doesn't know. I'm not worried. Not even a little bit. The cop car pulls up within six minutes. Fast response time. The door opens and an officer steps out, adjusting his belt. When he turns toward us, I see the exact moment Vanessa's smirk reaches its safe peek. She thinks she's won. What she doesn't know is that Officer Bradley isn't just any cop. He's my younger brother. Bradley walks up the driveway, his face completely neutral, professional. He glances at me with zero recognition. We talked about this exact scenario last week when Vanessa had threatened to make my life hell. Then turns his attention to her. Ma'am, what seems to be the problem here? Vanessa straightens up, playing the victim perfectly. Officer, thank god you're here. This man, she points at me dramatically, broke into my house. I want him arrested. Bradley pulls out his notepad, clicking his pen. Your house, you said? Yes, my house, she repeats, more confident now. And you own this property? I live here. Vanessa snaps, irritation creeping into her voice. We lived here together. Now it's mine. Ma'am, that's not what I asked. Bradley says, his tone still perfectly calm, do you own this Property? Is your name on the deed? It's my home. Bradley looks down at his notepad, then back at her. This house is registered solely to. He pauses, glancing at me. To this gentleman

You were supposed to do all the work for the group. It was agreed. Julie screamed at me in front of our history class, a blank slideshow with only our names was shown on the giant screen. Did you want us to fail? Julie hissed. You told me you had it. I say you did this on purpose. Julie stuttered. She kept flipping through blank note cards of our group project. The realization setting in that I didn't complete the group project like she wanted. Mr Cooper, Julie whined. He didn't do anything. She pointed a finger at me. You are a total loser. Mr Cooper had us sit back down. The entire class was laughing at Julie's red face. On Monday, my history teacher, Mr Cooper, had announced that on Friday we'd be presenting a history project. It was a slideshow and speech on World War 2. Mister Cooper gave us the guidelines and requirements and put us into groups of five. After class that afternoon, my group headed into the school library. Julie was the leader of the popular kids and thought she was the queen bee. Now I'm going to do the speaking because like I'm totally the best, Julie insisted before I even sat down. But like, totally. You're gonna actually do all the work, Julie demanded. I rolled my eyes, but I got to work anyway. I wasn't gonna let them ruin my grades. Christie I'm trusting you with the fashion. We can't look like total rejects. I don't think it matters what we look like. It's about our work, I said, and received an eye roll in return. I just wanted to get the project done. We have to work, Cameron asked, laughing, totally confused, throwing his football around. So did anyone see how awesome I was at the game last night? Cameron continued. Oh, Cameron, you were so sexy. Christie flirted. We should like totally go to my house. They started to talk and chat like it was lunch, period. Anytime I tried to speak, they got louder. So I tried to work on my part of the project. On Wednesday, I arrived at Christie's house and I could hear the music blasting. It looked like half the school had shown up. Cameron had the entire football team there. Kids were doing the devil's grass. Christie had hired a DJ. Julie was even drinking out of the red solo cups. Guys, I totally found the good stuff, Christie said, drunk out of her mind and holding two bottles of vodka. We we need to do our project. I had to shout over the music. We don't need your help, nerd. If you're so worried about it, finish it yourself. Leave, Julie snorted, pointing to the door. So I did. When I got home, I sent the project off to Julie's email, but there was nothing done. I even deleted my own work. If They didn't want my help. Fine, let I'm cook. Thursday at school, Julie grinned at me. Thanks for finishing the project. I guess you were useful after all. I just smiled and nodded. You're welcome. Anything for the group. I knew I had to talk to Mr Cooper. Cut to this morning. I had gotten to school early and went to his class. Mr Cooper, I need to explain something. I'm a little panicked. What if he didn't believe me? Luckily, he did. I showed him the entire slideshow.

He was running out the clock while improving what he thought would become his property. Then on day 27, a massive hotel style soaking tub showed up for the master bathroom with jets and built in mood lighting. The installation took six hours and two plumbers to connect everything, and the tub alone was $8,000. When they finished, Liam texted me a photo of himself in the tub holding a glass of wine with the caption living my best life. I forwarded it to my lawyer and told her we were moving. Day 29, I showed up with my grandmother. Liam answered the door in a bathrobe like he owned the place, and barely acknowledged us before heading back to make coffee on his new espresso machine. I walked my grandmother through every room, pointing out the upgrades with exaggerated excitement. She played along perfectly. Liam, this hot tub is incredible. And this new bedroom. You did all of this? He looked confused, but nodded slowly. I let her into the master bathroom and gestured at the massive tub. And this is the crown jewel. Liam spent weeks picking out every detail to thank me for letting him stay here during his hard time. My grandmother hugged him. That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard. Not many young people understand gratitude anymore. Liam opened his mouth, but I kept talking. I've been wanting to redo This kitchen for years, but never had time. Having you surprise me with all this as a gift is just incredible. His face went pale. Now that the project's done, you can head home and get back to your life. It's been almost 30 days. I handed him an envelope. This is your notice to vacate. You've got four hours. He ripped it open and his face turned red. You can't do this. I put over $75,000 into this place. I smiled. Into my place as a gift. Like I just told grandma, gifts don't come with conditions. He looked at my grandmother for support. I never said it was a gift. This is my house now. I've been living here. My grandmother's face fell. Liam, you just let him think you did all this out of kindness? That's very disappointing. Liam turned back to me, desperate. You knew what I was doing. You watched me do it. I shrugged. I watched you give me the most generous gift anyone's ever given me. Thank you so much for my new kitchen and bathroom. Liam tried to protest, but my grandmother was already walking toward the deck to try out the hot tub. He looked at me one last time, saw nothing but a smile, and left without packing. I called out thank you to my grandmother and turned to take a long bubble bath in my brand new soaking tub.

My cousin Liam called me three months ago asking to use my Delaware beach house for a weekend. He just gone through another breakup and needed somewhere quiet to think. I said sure because the place it's empty most weekends anyway, and he promised he'd be gone by Monday. When I handed him the keys, he grabbed me in a hug and said, you have no idea how much this means to me right now. I told him to enjoy the ocean and left it at that. Monday came and went without a word. I texted Tuesday morning asking if he was okay and he said the extended stay was doing wonders for his mental health and he'd be out by Friday. Friday became next Monday, then the following week, then excuses about car trouble and waiting for parts. Two weeks after I handed Liam the keys, my neighbour sent a photo of construction trucks in my driveway. I drove down immediately and walked into my house to find workers ripping out my kitchen cabinets while Liam stood there pointing at granite samples like he was choosing tile for his own renovation show. I stared at the gutted kitchen and asked what he thought he was doing. He didn't even look up from the countertop brochure in his hand. This kitchen is ancient and the layout makes no Sense I'm doing you a favor by fixing it while I'm here. You should be thanking me. I asked how he planned to pay for this and he waved me off. I've got it covered. You worry too much. Besides, it's not like you were using this place anyway. The contractor showed me the work order with Liam's name on it, requesting a full remodel with custom cabinets, stone countertops and new appliances. $28,000. I looked at Liam scrolling through his phone like this was all perfectly normal and something clicked. I told. I told the contractor everything looked great and to keep going. Then I walked out without another word. Over the next two weeks I watched my beach house transform into something I didn't recognise. A 15 thousand dollar hot tub appeared on the deck with crews running electrical lines and reinforcing the structure for three straight days. My neighbour kept me updated on the noise and the constant parade of trucks and I told her it would be over soon. All my furniture disappeared and got replaced with a 12 thousand dollar leather sectional, matching chairs and a glass dining table that probably cost more than both. A construction crew framed out a whole new bedroom addition off the back of the house with Florida ceiling windows facing the water and the permits and construction ran him another 14,000. I checked the county permits and found Liam had filed everything under his name as the property owner. Forging paperwork that said he had authority to make structural changes.

I was in the bathroom during lunch when I heard two girls talking outside. Did you see Lena's test? Another hundred. Obviously she goes to Caldwell's tutoring. I sat there frozen because I just got my test back that morning. 54. I'd studied for hours and knew every answer. I rushed back to class and grabbed my test from my bag. Then I looked at Lena's desk. Her test was sitting there with 100 circled in green pen. We'd studied together the night before. I'd helped her understand half the material. During class, I glanced at her answers. They looked almost identical to mine. But mine was covered in red marks. After class, I caught up to her. My heart was pounding. Lena, how did you get 100? Our answers were the same. She wouldn't look at me. I go to Mister Caldwell's tutoring. You should try it. Then she walked away fast. That night, I laid my last three tests out. 58, 61, 54. Each one worse. Even though I studied harder. I needed to figure out what was happening. The next week, I went to Caldwell's classroom after school. I felt nauseous the entire walk there. Mister Caldwell, I need help understanding why I keep failing. He barely looked up. You're not putting in the effort. My chest got tight. But I study constantly. I know this material. He stared at me like I was the dumbest person he'd Ever seen? Then maybe history isn't your strong suit. You should consider switching to regular history. I felt my face getting hot. My answers are the same as students who are passing. His voice went ice cold. Are you accusing me of something? My mouth went dry. No, I just don't understand the grading. He waved his hand at me. Then figure it out yourself. I have work to do. I left feeling worthless. Next test came back worse. 49. I cried in the bathroom during lunch. Before turning that test in, I'd taken a photo of my answers. When I compared it to my graded test, I felt sick. Half my correct answers were marked wrong. Meanwhile, Lena showed me her test. Another hundred. One of her essay answers was three sentences that barely made sense. I showed her my photo, which was a full paragraph with dates and analysis. She glanced at it, then looked down. I don't want to talk about this. Her voice was quiet and scared. Over the next month, I noticed the pattern. Girls were getting top scores while guys were failing. I started sitting with three other guys from class. At lunch, we laid out our tests. All of us were failing despite knowing the material. All of us had jobs or sports after school. One of them said he'd asked Caldwell for help and got told to stop wasting his time. We started keeping track. 8 girls getting straight hundreds. 12 of Us failing everything. Then one of the guys said something that made my skin crawl. All those girls go to Caldwell after school, tutoring. Every single one of them. I went to my guidance counselor with this Pat. She looked at me like I was being dramatic. Mr. Caldwell has been here 15 years. If you're failing, maybe you need to take responsibility. Nobody would listen. Caldwell acted like I didn't exist. My grade dropped to a 46. I was going to fail this class, and nobody cared. In January, I can't take it anymore. I walk to the principal's office with the photos, the pattern and the proof. The three other guys are right behind me. We're done being quiet. The principal listens without interrupt

I raised my hand as a joke. I helped my mom watch YouTube videos when she was pregnant with my brother. Does that count? The class laughed and I smiled, proud of my quick thinking. But Mister Gonzales wasn't smiling. His face had gone completely white and his hands were shaking as he gripped the edge of his desk. Good. Come with me now. The entire classroom went silent in South Dallas when a teacher used that tone. You didn't ask questions. Everyone stay in your seats. Do not leave this room. If I'm not back in 20 minutes, have someone call 9, 1 1. He was already pulling me toward the door and that's when I noticed the dark stain on his sleeve. Wet. It looked like blood. Mr Gonzales, what's happening? Is someone hurt? I tried to pull my arm free, but his grip was iron tight. I don't think I'm qualified for whatever. You're the only one who raised their hand. He cut me off. That makes you qualified. Outside, his car was already running with the doors open. She said she had until Thursday. He kept muttering while speeding out of the school parking lot. The midwife isn't answering her phone I the door handle, calculating if I could jump out at the next red light. Mr Gonzales, you're scaring me. Should I call my mom? No. He swerved around. A car and I slammed into the window. No one can know. Put your phone away. Turn it off. I'm not turning off my phone, I shouted. But I did anyway. We were going 50 in a 25 zone and Mr Gonzales kept checking his mirrors like someone was following us. Finally, he pulled into a driveway of a small yellow house that definitely wasn't his. Listen to me. He grabbed my shoulders before we got out. They can't know she was here. Do you understand? No matter what happens, they can't know. I don't understand anything. I was practically yelling, now I'm 17. I don't even have my license yet. Marco. He used my name for the first time, his voice desperate. You've kept bigger secrets than this. I know your family. I need that same silence now. He wasn't wrong. I'd already seen two drive bys this year and never said a word to the cops. But this felt different. He shoved a pair of surgical gloves into my hands. Put these on. The front door was unlocked. Inside, we followed the sound of crying to a back bedroom where a woman was curled up on a bare mattress. She looked young, maybe early 20s, with long black hair stuck to her face with sweat. It's too early, she gasped in accented English when she saw us. Then she looked at me and started crying harder. He's just a child. You brought a child. I'm 17, I said. Stupid like that made any difference? I watch Grey's anatomy, if that helps. She switched to Spanish and started begging Mister Gonzales for something I couldn't understand. He pushed me toward her. Check how dilated she is. What? I backed up so fast I knocked over.

She didn't name me directly, but everyone knew. She made another post implying I was too focused on work to keep a boyfriend. All lies. I blocked her, muted their numbers, deleted their emails. Their problem, not mine. A week later, I flew to Florida to see my grandfather, Walter. He'd always been fair, the only one who saw through their bullshit. I told him everything. The dinner, dad's toast, Vanessa's lies, the years of sending $600 monthly while they praised her for nothing. Grandpa Walter's face hardened. That's not family. That's betrayal. He called his lawyer that afternoon. I'm changing the will, he said firmly. They don't deserve a cent. He cut out Mom, Dad and Vanessa completely. Everything, his properties, his land, his entire estate went to me. You've earned it, he said. Not for what you've done but for who you are. I flew back to Chicago the next day, didn't call them, didn't check their messages. I focused on my work instead. Landed a huge client, a tech startup worth $2.5 million. My boss hinted at a promotion to senior manager. Meanwhile, their store collapsed without me. The $600 monthly payments stopped. Suppliers cut them off. A tax audit hit them $30,000 in penalties. Problems I've been preventing for years. The bank for closed, the store closed permanently. Vanessa's dreams of expanding into a chain, dead Busters pulled out immediately. Her Facebook lies, Backfired, too. Family members started digging and found my bank statements, proof I've been funding everything. You lied about her. One aunt commented, she carried all of you. Vanessa's reputation crumbled. Co workers whispered. Family unfollowed her. Mom and dad lost everything. Without the store's income, they couldn't pay their second mortgage. The bank seized their house. They moved into a tiny apartment, cramming their belongings into storage. Relatives who'd once praised them now avoided their calls, stopped inviting them to gatherings. Grandpa Walter didn't budge. He sent me a letter confirming the new will. It's done. They get nothing. When mom called begging for a meeting, he refused. You made your bed. He blocked Vanessa's number. Dad never even tried reaching out. Six months after that dinner, I got a call from a cousin. Your parents are selling everything they own, she said. The house is gone. Vanessa's bouncing between retail jobs. They're completely broke. I felt nothing, no guilt, no sadness, just relief.

I was devastated but also angry. We were supposed to travel to Europe next summer. She promised we'd finally do that sister trip we talked about for years. At her funeral, so many people I didn't know came up to me saying how much she talked about me, her brilliant little sister who was going places. It felt like they were talking about someone else's sister. Dad handed me her personal effects in a small box. Her phone was still working. I scrolled through her calendar and saw dozens of reminders about my life, my exam dates, my work presentation, even my dentist appointment next month. She had an alert set for my favorite band's new album release. I sat in my car for an hour just staring at these digital bread crumbs of her love. While cleaning out her apartment, I found this worn leather journal. Inside was her neat handwriting dated 16 years ago. The first entry was from when I was 7. Mom's not doing well. The doctor say she has weeks. She made me promise to look after sis. I'm only fifteen, but I swore I would. I never knew our mom was sick. Dad always told me she died suddenly from a heart condition. I kept reading. Every page detailed how my sister rearranged her entire life to keep her promise. She turned down her dream college because it Was too far from home. She worked nights so she could walk me to school in the mornings. She scheduled her classes around my activities so I'd never be alone. There was an entry from the night of that concert. She's so mad at me for showing up, but there were older guys hanging around. I'd rather have her angry than hurt. And about Ryan found out he got arrested for dealing. Can't tell her how I know. Dad's police friend tipped me off. She'll understand someday. The last entry was from the week before she died. Sometimes I wonder if she resents how much I'm in her business. But I promised mom I'd keep her safe. Maybe someday she'll understand it wasn't control, it was love.

I always thought my older sister was overprotective. Growing up, she'd walk me to school, even though her high school was in the opposite direction. She'd check my homework, pack my lunches, and always asked who I was hanging out with. It drove me crazy. When I was 13, I wanted to go to my first concert with friends. No parents, just us. She insisted on coming along, sitting rose behind us like some kind of shadow. I remember the burning embarrassment when my friend spotted her. I didn't speak to her for days afterward. In high school, she somehow always knew when I was hanging out with Ryan, this guy she thought was trouble. She'd conveniently need to pick me up early or would show up with some urgent reason. One night, she literally pulled me out of a party where there was drinking. I screamed at her in the car that she was ruining my life. She just gripped the steering wheel tighter and said, hate me now if you need to. When I moved away for college, she'd call every Sunday without fail. She'd ask about my classes, if I was eating right, did I need money for books. I'd rush through these calls, annoyed at her constant hovering. Sometimes I'd accidentally miss her calls, texting later with flimsy excuses. For my 21st birthday, she surprised me by flying cross country. I had plans with friends. That weekend. But she'd already booked us tickets to this play I'd mentioned once months before. I reluctantly canceled my parties. She seemed so happy during that weekend that I couldn't bring myself to tell her how much her visit had disrupted my life. Last year she planned this huge family reunion for our parents anniversary. I complained the whole time about taking time off work. She just smiled and said, family is everything, kiddo. During that weekend, she pulled me aside and made me promise to come home for Christmas. No excuses this time, she said, hugging me tighter than usual. I promised half heartedly.

I smiled, as you wish, Dad. Six months later, their empire crumbled without me. We wish Vanessa was our only child. My dad said it at their 35th anniversary dinner. Glass raised, voice clear eyes on me. The entire restaurant went silent. Aunts, uncles, cousins all staring. My sister Vanessa smirked, savoring every second. I didn't cry, didn't yell, just stood up, grabbed my purse and walked out. My heels clicked against the hardwood floor as something inside me finally snapped. For years I've been there. Invisible fix it person daughter. They ignored while praising Vanessa for everything. I won a math competition. They missed it. For Vanessa's recital, I got promoted to finance manager. They spent the entire family dinner talking about Vanessa's retail job and their store, their precious failing business. I've been keeping it alive for years, $600 every month from my own pocket. Hours of free financial advice, negotiating with suppliers, fixing their tax problems, optimizing their inventory. Did they thank me? Never. They'd call Vanessa instead, bragging about how her marketing ideas saved the day. At that anniversary dinner, I tried one last time. I've been analyzing the store's numbers. I said if you streamline inventory and cut some suppliers, you could save thousands. Vanessa raised an eyebrow. Inventory? That's adorable. I have real ideas. The table laughed. Mom cut in sharply. Let's not bore everyone with numbers, sweetie. Dad didn't even look at Me, Vanessa knows what she's doing. Then came his toast, his wish that Vanessa was their only child. At night, I sat alone in my apartment and made a decision. I grabbed my phone and typed into our family group chat, I'm done helping with the store. No more money, no more advice. Good luck. I hit send and turned off my phone. By morning, I had 11 missed calls. Dad's voicemails went from confused to angry. Mom sent long emails about family legacy. Vanessa called twice, demanding I stop overreacting. I ignored every single one. Three days later.

And I just, he held up his hand to stop me. Brian, how long have you been working here? Three years, I said, confused about where this was going. And in those three years, have you ever called in sick? I thought about it. No, I don't think so. Have you ever missed a deadline? No. Have you ever complained about overtime or weekend work? No. But I don't understand what this has to do with. Rick leaned back in his chair. That text wasn't meant for me, but it told me something important. It showed me how you talk about the people you care about, the respect and appreciation you have. Most people would have been complaining about taking care of a sick wife and a cranky baby, but you were praising her. I just stared at him not sure what to say. We've been looking for someone to promote to senior analyst, Rick continued. Someone who can handle stress, who appreciates their team, who doesn't crack under pressure. I've been watching you this week and even though you're clearly exhausted, you haven't dropped the ball once. My brain was struggling to process what was happening. Are you saying? I'm saying that Accidental Text showed me more about your character than any interview could. The job comes with a 20% raise and your own office interested. I sat there in shock for a minute, but I called you babe. Rick laughed. My wife. Thinks it's hilarious. He said, anyone who talks about their family like that is someone she'd want me working with. I took the promotion, obviously, but the best part came later that day when I texted Emma the good news. She wrote back, wait, so you got promoted because you accidentally told your boss you wanted to hug him? I replied pretty much. Her response was just crying, laughing emojis, and this is the most ridiculous thing that's ever happened to us.

Mom, Potato likes me, he smiled. The potato has feelings. After that, she was obsessed, but in the weirdest way. She'd narrate his entire existence to anyone who'd listen. That's my brother, potato. He can't do anything. He just lays there and leaks from both ends. Sometimes he screams for no reason, but he likes me best. At the grocery store, my mom made a potato baby. He's useless but cute. To the mailman, Wanna see my potato brother? Warning, he might poop while you're looking at preschool show and tell. She brought a picture. This is James, but I call him potato because he looked like one when he was born. He's better looking now, but still can't do anything useful. She appointed herself his translator. He'd cry and she'd announce. Potato wants milk, potato needs a new diaper. Potato is bored of existing, usually wrong, but she tried. Now James is 18 months old, walking and talking. Lucy still calls him potato, but lovingly. He thinks it's his name. His first word wasn't Mama or Dada. It was Tato. Pointing at himself last week at the park, another mom asked his name. James, I said potato. Kids corrected in unison. The mom looked confused. Lucy explained he was ugly when he was born, so I called him potato. Now he's cute, but the name stuck, right, Potato? James nodded proudly. I Tato. I've accepted that my son will probably be called potato. Until college, maybe beyond. Lucy's already planning to tell his future girlfriends about how he was born looking like a root vegetable. But watching her teach him to go down the slide yesterday, yelling, you can do it, potato, potato, potatoes are brave, while he giggled hysterically, worth every embarrassing public explanation of why my toddler responds to potato better than his actual name, though I am saving for his future therapy bills.

My four year old daughter, Lucy had been preparing for months. Made drawings of me and my baby brother, practice diaper changing on her dolls, even saved her allowance to buy him a teddy bear. When we brought baby James home, she took one look at him and burst into tears. What's wrong with his face? James was perfectly healthy, but newborns aren't exactly Instagram ready. Red, wrinkled eyes, swollen shut. Lucy was expecting a Gerber baby. She got a potato with hair. Take him back! This isn't the baby from the pictures she. I meant the pregnancy app images we'd shown her. Chubby, smiling, adorable three month olds. Not fresh from the womb. Reality. For three days, she refused to look at him, called him the wrinkly thing, and asked when the real baby was coming. I'd catch her peeking at him from around corners, then running away disgusted. Day four, she approached cautiously while I was nursing. Stared at him for a full minute. Why is he eating from your body? That's gross. Give him real food. I explained how babies eat. Her response, I'm never having babies. This is too weird. But then James opened his eyes and looked right at her. She gasped, mom, the potato has eyes! From then on, she called him potato. Not mainly, just matter of factly. Can I hold potato? Potato. Is crying again. Why does potato smell so bad? Week 2 she started warming up. Brought him her toys, but was offended when he didn't play with them. I gave him my best Barbie and he just laid there. Rude. Week 3 she tried teaching him to talk. Say Lucy, Lucy, come on, it's easy. Got frustrated when he just drooled. Mom, I think potato is broken. He's leaking! The turning point came when he smiled at her. A real smile, not gas. She screamed.

Wednesday morning, I'm sitting at my desk staring at a spreadsheet that might as well have been written in ancient Greek. My phone buzzes with a text from Emma asking me to pick up more soup on my way home. I start typing back how much I love her and how she's the strongest person I know for dealing with being sick while taking care of our cranky baby. But here's where it gets weird. I was so tired that when I hit send, I didn't notice I'd accidentally selected my boss Rick's name instead of Emma's. The text I sent him was, you're amazing, babe. I don't know how you do it all. You're like a superhero in pajamas. Love you so much. Can't wait to give you a big hug when I get home. I didn't realize my mistake until an hour later when Rick knocked on my cubicle wall. My heart literally stopped. I thought I was about to get fired for the most embarrassing reason ever. who accidentally calls their boss babe and talks about hugging them? But Rick just stood there with this weird smile on his face. He didn't say anything for, like, 10 seconds, which felt like forever. Finally, he goes, hey, can we talk in my office? I followed him, already mentally packing up my desk. I was rehearsing my explanation in my head, trying to figure out how to explain that I wasn't a complete weirdo. Rick closed the door and sat down across from me. So he said, I got your text. I wanted to disappear into the floor. Rick, I'm so sorry. That was meant for my wife.

Wesley's chest puffed out. Good. Call the landlord. I'm taking over this lease anyway. Melanie and I are common law now. Five minutes later, Mr Sanders walked in with his master keys jingling. He was this sixty year old Brooklyn native who'd owned the building for 30 years. He took one look at the scene. Wesley with his bags, Mitchell trying to look intimidating, Melanie shrinking into the couch and me standing there calm as could be. What's going on here? Mr Sanders asked, though his slight smirk told me he already knew. Wesley stepped forward with all the confidence of someone who'd watched too many law shows. I'm moving in and she's moving out. I've been living here for three months, which makes me a tenant. Melanie and I are together, so I'm taking over her half of the lease. Mr Sanders looked at Wesley like he just said the earth was flat. Then he started laughing. Not a chuckle, but a full belly laugh that went on for a solid 30 seconds. Wesley's face started twitching. What's so funny, old man? Mr Sanders wiped his eyes and pulled out his phone. Let me show you something, son. He pulled up a document. This is the lease for apartment 2C. See that single name? That's not Melanie. That's not you. That's her. He pointed at me. There is no Melanie on this lease. She's been subletting from her, which Technically, I only allowed as a favor. Wesley turned to Melanie, his mouth hanging open. You said you were on the lease. Melanie looked at the floor. I thought I was. Mr Sanders continued, clearly enjoying himself. And you, young man, aren't even supposed to be here. The lease specifically states overnight guests, maximum three nights per week. You've been violating that for months. I could have you trespassed right now. Mitchell started backing toward the door. Wesley was frozen. But I, I'm getting mail here. That doesn't mean anything. Mr Sanders laughed. My cat gets mail here, too. Doesn't mean he owns the place. Wesley looked at me, then at Melanie, then back at Mr Sanders. This can't be legal. Oh, it's completely legal. In fact, you have exactly five minutes to grab your bags and leave before I call the police. And Melanie, you might want to start looking for your own place. Your subletting agreement ends next month. Wesley grabbed his bags, Mitchell already halfway to the elevator. Melanie ran after them, crying.

Take your hands off my daughter now. This is ridiculous. Katie, tell them the kid is lying, the groom demanded. But Katie, the bride, was shaking her head. She's not lying, dad. Show them your phone. Tyler, what? Tyler looked panicked. Now show them the texts you sent me last night when I said I wanted to postpone the wedding. Tyler started backing away. This is insane. I'm not showing anyone anything. But Katie was already pulling out her own phone. Then I'll show them mine, he started reading out loud. You better not embarrass me tomorrow or you'll regret it. You're nothing without me. If you try to leave, I'll make sure no one ever wants you. The wedding guests started murmuring. Some people were pulling out their phones to record. Tyler realized he was cornered and completely lost it. Fine. Yeah, I said that she needed to hear it. She was being dramatic about nothing. One little fight and she wanted to call off our whole wedding. Katie's dad moved between Tyler and his daughter. Get out now before I call the police. Tyler started yelling about how much money he'd spent on the wedding, how Katie was ruining everything, how her family never liked him anyway. Two of Katie's brothers stepped up next to their dad and Tyler finally realized he was outnumbered. This is all your fault, he said, pointing at me and Emma. You and your weird kid ruined my life. No, Katie said firmly. You ruined your own life the first time you put your hands on me. Tyler stormed off and Katie sat down on a park bench still in her wedding dress, crying. Not sad crying, but relief crying. Her mom and sisters gathered around her and her dad was already on the phone, probably canceling venues and vendors. I was about to leave them alone when Katie called out, wait, please. She walked over to us. What's your daughter's name? Emma, I said. Katie knelt down again. Emma, thank you for being brave and telling the truth. You saved me from making a big mistake. Emma just nodded, seriously, like this was a normal Tuesday for her. My mommy says truth is always better, even when it's scary. Katie looked at me. You're raising an incredible kid. I'm so sorry about what you went through before. We're okay now, I said. And it looks like you will be, too.

The landlord started laughing. My roommate's boyfriend, Wesley, had been planning this moment for months, ever since he started staying over back in June. He'd been telling his boys about how he was finessing his way into a free apartment. He even started forwarding his mail here to establish what he called residency rights. The relationship wasn't even official before Wesley started making his move. He'd walk around my apartment, well, what he thought was going to be his apartment, measuring room and telling his cousin which wall would be perfect for his TV setup. Melanie's been carrying this dead weight for too long, he'd mutter while eating my groceries. Time for her to learn she doesn't need a roommate anymore. So there I was, standing in my own living room on a Thursday night. The whole place smelled like the Cologne Wesley bathed in. Wesley showed up with his cousin Mitchell and two duffel bags, already acting like he owned the place, both of them looking like they were ready to physically move me out if needed. Melanie, I hope you found somewhere else to stay, Wesley said, dropping his bags by the door. This is happening tonight. You've been taking advantage of my girl's kindness for long enough. I stayed quiet, scrolling through my phone, let him have his moment. Melanie sat on the couch, avoiding eye contact with everyone. Wesley had been working on her for weeks. Convincing her that I was holding her back, that they needed their privacy, that couples shouldn't have roommates. She'd started parroting his words recently. Maybe it's time for a change. Maybe we've outgrown this arrangement. Classic Wesley manipulation. The man didn't even have his own place. He'd been couch surfing before he latched onto Melanie. Wesley pulled out a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket. I printed out this 30 day notice. But honestly, you to just go tonight. Make this easy on everyone. Mitchell nodded like this was all perfectly legal. Smart move, Wesley. She's had a free ride long enough. I looked at the paper and almost laughed. He downloaded some random eviction template and just wrote my name on it in pen. Melanie finally spoke up, her voice barely a whisper. Maybe we can give her the weekend at least. Wesley shot her a look that made her shut up immediately. Nah, baby, we discussed this. She goes tonight. That's when I made the call. Hey, Mister. Sanders, I said, putting him on speaker. Could you

The bride stopped mid pose. Her photographer looked confused and about 30 wedding guests turned to stare at my three year old daughter Emma standing by the playground swings. I was mortified. Emma had this habit of saying random things loudly at the worst possible moments, but this was next level embarrassing. Emma, honey, let's go play on the slides, I whispered, trying to drag her away from the wedding party, but she wasn't having it. She broke free from my grip and marched right up to the bride, tugging on her dress. Lady, don't marry the mean man, Emma said, pointing directly at the groom. He's gonna hurt you. Everyone went dead silent. The groom's face went red and he started walking toward us looking angry. Hey, what kind of kid says something like that? What are you teaching her? I started apologizing, explaining that Emma was just 3 and had an active imagination. But then the bride knelt down to Emma's level and asked quietly, sweetie, why do you think he's mean? Emma pointed to a bruise on the bride's wrist that was barely covered by her dress sleeve. My mommy had marks like that when the bad man lived with us. She cried at night, too, just like you smell like tears under your makeup. My heart stopped. This kid had been through way too much for her age, but she developed This weird ability to spot things adults tried to hide. When my ex was still around, Emma would always know when I've been crying, even if I thought I'd covered it up perfectly. The bride's face went pale. She looked down at her wrist, back at Emma. You're very smart, little girl. Then she stood up and looked at her groom. We need to talk right now. What? No, we're not doing this here because some random kid made stuff up, the groom said, grabbing the bride's arm. But he grabbed it right where the bruise was. And she winced visibly. That's when the bride's dad stepped forward. He was a big guy. Probably worked.

But I wanted to do more than just get him kicked off. I started documenting everything. I took screenshots of him changing my playlists, recorded videos of songs suddenly switching while I was using the app, and even got my friend to witness him controlling my music from across the classroom. Then I found out something interesting. Ben had been bragging to other people about hacking not just my account, but several other students accounts too. He thought it was hilarious that he could mess with people's music and make them look stupid. So I reached out to those other kids and found out they had the same experience. Random music playing at inappropriate times, embarrassing songs showing up in their recent activity playlists, getting messed with. Some of them had even gotten in trouble with their parents when explicit songs started playing through their home speakers. We all decided to report this together. But instead of just going to Spotify, we went to the school administration first. Turns out what Ben was doing counts as cyberbullying and harassment. And our school has a zero tolerance policy for that kind of stuff. The school called his parents and mine for a meeting. When they showed all the evidence we had collected, Ben's face went completely white. His parents were furious because they had no idea their son was using his computer skills to torment other students. But here's where it gets Really good. The school decided to involve the police because technically what Ben did was unauthorized access to other people's accounts, which is actually illegal. They called it computer fraud and abuse. Ben started crying and begging everyone not to press charges. He promised he would stop and even offered to help us secure our accounts better. But it was too late. The damage was done and we were all fed up with his behavior. The police officer explained that even though we were all minors, this kind of digital harassment was taken seriously. Ben ended up getting charged with multiple counts of unauthorized computer access and cyberbullying. His parents had to hire a lawyer and pay thousands of dollars in legal fees. He got suspended from school for two weeks and had to do community service. The court also ordered him to stay away from all of us and prohibited him from using any social media or streaming services for six months.

So there's this kid at school named Ben who thinks he's some kind of tech genius. He's always bragging about how he can hack into anything and showing off with his fancy coding skills. Most people just ignore him, but he made the mistake of targeting me last month. I was sitting in the library working on an essay when Ben comes over and starts looking at my laptop screen. I had Spotify open in another tab because I was listening to music while I worked. Starts laughing and says my playlist is trash and asks if he can show me some real music. I said no thanks and went back to my work, but Ben doesn't take no for an answer. He pulls out his phone and starts typing away and suddenly my Spotify starts skipping songs. Then it switches to some death metal band I've never heard of. I look at him and he's got this smug grin on his face, whispers that he's connected to my account and can control it from his phone. Then he starts blasting the volume up and down just to mess with me. The librarian comes over and tells me to keep it down, which was embarrassing because everyone was staring. I told Ben to stop, but he just kept going. He changed my playlist name to something stupid and started adding weird songs to it. When I tried to change it back on my laptop, he Would just override it from his phone. It was like playing tug of war with my own account. The worst part was when he started following random people on my account and liking their playlists. Some of them were really inappropriate ones with explicit names. I was mortified because all my friends could see this stuff in their activity feed. After about 20 minutes of this torture, I finally had enough. I grabbed my stuff and left the library. But even at home he was still messing with my account. Songs would randomly start playing in the middle of the night or my playlists would get deleted and recreated with terrible music. This went on for three days. Ben would walk past me in the hallway and smirk, knowing he had complete control over my Spotify. He even changed my profile picture to some meme of a crying baby. I tried changing my password, but somehow he still had access. That's when I came up with my plan. I did some research and found out that Spotify has a feature with

My 10 year old son came home confused because his history teacher told the class that the Great Wall of China is visible from space with the naked eye. My son Alex has always been fascinated by space. Since he was five, we've spent countless nights stargazing with our telescope. He knows all the planets and can recite facts about the International Space Station. Last year, I bought him a book signed by Chris Hadfield, the famous astronaut. Alex treasures it and can quote entire passages about what earth actually looks like from space. But everything changed when Mr Peterson started teaching history during a lesson about ancient wonders, told the class that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space with the naked eye. Alex raised his hand and explained that astronauts have confirmed this isn't true. The wall is too narrow and blends with the landscape. He mentioned that Hadfield's typically addressed this myth in his book. Mister Peterson cut him off. That's nonsense, he said. It's in our textbook and I've been teaching this fact for 20 years. Your little astronaut book is wrong. The next day, Alex brought in his signed book to show the passage. Instead of listening, Mister Peterson confiscated it, calling it disruptive material. He made Alex stand in front of the class and recite the Great Wall of China is visible from space. 10 times. When Alex came home, he was devastated. His precious signed book was gone and he felt humiliated. Mister Peterson had assigned a 5 page essay on the importance of respecting teacher's knowledge as punishment. I was furious. I emailed Mister Peterson explaining the facts and asking for the book back. His response, I don't need space facts from a parent. The curriculum says the wall is visible from space. That's what I teach. The principal seemed reluctant to contradict a 10 year teacher over what she called a minor factual dispute. That's when I decided to take action. My college roommate now work.

He said, my mom told me not to talk to him ever, said it would mess everything up. He just glared at me until I told him I had no idea what he was talking about. He got really confused and said something that shocked me to my core. He said, your dad? He was my brother. I just stood there frozen. Explained how my grandfather paid his mom off to never say anything and never told his wife or my dad that he existed. But his mom told him when he was young about the entire situation. She admitted she was really hard on him. She constantly insisted that the name, the house, the family, it should belong to him, not me. I felt the floor tilt beneath me. I said, you bullied me because you were jealous. He flinched and said, no, yes, I don't know. I hated you because you had Everything. I wasn't allowed to want a dad who loved you, a real home. I wanted a brother, but I wasn't allowed to be with the one I had. We sat in silence once, not out of avoidance, but grief muted and shared. Later that week, I pulled out an old photo album, showed him pictures of my dad in a Santa suit falling off the roof because he thought it'd be funny to land on the sleigh.

Now I know why I didn't cry at my grandfather's funeral. Not because I wasn't sad, I was just numb. My parents died 3 years ago in a car crash I'm still pretending didn't ruin me. Grandfather was the last thread connecting me to anything that felt like home. when the lawyer handed me the will and said I'd inherited the estate, I didn't feel joy, just more weight. But there was a catch. Of course there was. The lawyer said to claim full ownership, you'll need to live on the property for one year with another party also named in the will. And that other party turned out to be Caleb, the same Caleb who used to shove my face into my mashed potatoes in the cafeteria for an hour in 8th grade. Childhood bully. I laughed at the lawyer and said, this has to be a joke. That's when he walked in wearing a weathered leather jacket with his arms crossed and a face like he'd rather be anywhere else. Caleb said, trust me, if it is, I'm not laughing either. Neither of us wanted to spend our time together, but free housing in this economy was no joke. So we both signed and moved in. We avoided each other like a mouse would avoid a cat, only neither of us knew who the cat was. The house was massive enough that We barely crossed paths until the peanut thing. I was eating trail mix in the kitchen when he walked in, froze and said, you trying to kill me? I blinked and said, you allergic? He said, all it would take was one whiff and it's Epipen and ambulance time. I told him that my dad had the same allergy. Caleb's eyes flicked to mine and something passed there, something like recognition, guilt. It was gone before I could catch it. The days dragged into weeks. We didn't speak much, but the silence began to change. It softened. I caught him fixing the broken gutter one morning without being asked. Then I started leaving coffee on the counter for him as he rushed to work each morning.

It was an investment. Will took another sip of beer. Best money I ever spent. Jen was staring at him like she'd never seen him before. Will, what the hell is wrong with you? Nothing's wrong with me. I'm senior partner at my firm. I'm successful. Jackson's the one teaching teenagers about the Constitution for 40 grand a year. Sarah's nails were digging into my palm. You sick son of a Sarah. Mom interrupted, but her voice was shaking. I couldn't breathe. Every late night studying, every practice test, every time I told myself I just wasn't cut out for it. All of it was a lie. Remember when you cried after the second failure? Will was smiling now. Called me at 2 in the morning, said you didn't know if you should try again. That was my favorite part. You comforted him, Jen whispered. You told him to keep trying. Had to make it convincing. I looked at my hands. These hands that graded essays instead of writing legal briefs. These hands that erased whiteboards instead of signing contracts. I gave up. I said, yeah, you did. Will stood up, stretching. Anyway, that's my 3. What did you think? Pretty good game, right? Dad stood up too slowly. He was looking at will like he was a stranger. Get out, dad said. Oh, come on. It's just get out. Mom was crying now, silent tears running down her face. I don't know you, she said to will. I don't know who you are. It's not that big a deal. You destroyed your brother's life for fun, Jen said, for $15,000 in fun. Will looked around the room, his smile finally fading. You're all overreacting. The bar exam, I said quietly. I'm taking it again next month. What? I never stopped studying. I met his eyes. I take it every year just to see. This year I was going to pass. Will's face went pale. And now I'm going to pass it. Become a lawyer. My first case is going to be suing you for fraud and emotional distress. Sarah squeezed my hand. Good luck with that, will said, but his voice cracked. No, mom said. Standing up. Good luck finding another family. She walked out. Dad followed without looking back. Will grabbed his jacket, looked at me one more time. You can't prove anything. Maybe not, I said. But they know. Everyone knows now.

Truth or lie? His truth made my parents walk out and never look at him the same again. We were playing two truths and a lie. Just family. Mom, dad, my wife Sarah, my sister Jen and will. It was supposed to be fun. Will was on his third beer. That cocky grin plastered on his face. Alright, my turn. Here's a good one. He leaned back in his chair. One, I got promoted to senior partner last week. 2. I'm moving to Seattle next month. 3, I paid someone to sabotage your bar exam. Everyone laughed. Classic will, always trying to be the center of attention. Will be serious, mom said, shuffling cards. But he wasn't laughing anymore. He was staring right at me. The lie is Seattle. I'm not going anywhere. The room went quiet. What? I said, your bar exam. He continued, casual as anything. Remember how you failed it three times? Couldn't figure out why you kept choking. Sarah's hand found mine under the table. Will, that's not funny. It's not a joke. He pulled out his phone, scrolling through old emails. Cost me 15 grand total. Total. But man, it was worth it. My chest felt tight. You're lying, am I? He turned his phone toward me. Email chains, names, dates, your second Proctor, Michael Chen. Gambling debts. I paid him to Mark your essays. Wrong. Third time. Different guy. Same Problem. Needed money for his sick head. Here to the screen. The dates matched. Everything matched. You failed the bar three times, will said. Started doubting yourself, went into teaching instead. I watched you give up on being a lawyer. Five years. Five years of thinking I wasn't smart enough. Of watching my law school friends succeed while I taught high school civics. Of Sarah telling me it was okay, that teaching was noble while I died inside. Every day. Mom's wine glass slipped from her hand and shattered on the floor. Nobody moved to clean it. Why I finally managed, will shrugged. You were always the golden child. Perfect grades, perfect wife, mom and Dad's favorite. I just wanted to see you fail at something. $15,000, Dad said quietly, to destroy your.

I needed soup. Anyway, I followed her there, too. Tyler was starting to calm down a little, but then got a second wind when I wouldn't give him my phone. The crying got even louder. This lady kept looking back at me with this horrified expression, every single aisle she went to. I went to dairy section, suddenly needed milk and yogurt, pasta aisle, time to stock up on spaghetti. Cleaning supplies, better grab some dish soap. I stayed about 5 feet behind her the whole time, housing shelves, comparing prices, acting totally normal except for my screaming kid in the cart. Other shoppers started noticing. One younger guy actually grinned at me when he figured out what I was doing. An older man gave me a thumbs up. But this lady was getting more and more frustrated. She'd speed up, I'd speed up. She'd backtrack to an aisle we'd already been down, so would I. After about 15 minutes of this, she only had like four items in her basket. He looked at me one more time and I just smiled at her while Tyler screamed about wanting goldfish crackers. She turned around, marched straight to the checkout with her half done shopping and I watched her leave the store. Tyler actually calmed down right after she left like he knew the mission was complete. I finished my entire shopping list in peace, got everything I needed, even remembered the milk I'd actually run out of at checkout. The teenage cashier was trying not to laugh. Did you really just follow that lady around the whole store? She asked quietly. I shrugged. She had opinions about my parenting, figured she should experience it up close. When I got to the car, I felt better than I had an.

So this happened when my son, Tyler, was about 2. He's seven now and doing great. But back then, we didn't know he had autism yet. We just thought he was going through a really tough phase. Free trip to the store was a gamble. Some days he'd be fine. Other days, it was a complete meltdown over nothing. This particular Tuesday, I'd been up since 5 because Tyler had a bad night. My husband was out of town for work. I had exactly one hour between Tyler's morning nap and when I had to pick up my daughter from preschool. I needed groceries desperately. We were down to cereal crumbs and ketchup packets. We got to the store, and everything was okay for maybe 10 minutes. Then we passed the toy aisle. Tyler saw this blue truck on the shelf and lost his mind. He started screaming and reaching for it. I tried explaining we couldn't get it today. I tried distracting him with his favorite snack. Nothing worked. He was full on sobbing. That kind of cry where kids can barely breathe. I'm pushing the cart through the produce section, trying to grab apples with one hand while patting Tyler's back with the other. I'm exhausted. I probably look like a mess. My hair is in a greasy ponytail, and I'm wearing the same shirt from yesterday. Other shoppers are Giving me sympathetic looks or just avoiding eye contact completely. I get it. Nobody wants to be near a screaming toddler. Then this older woman walks past us. She's got perfect silver hair and designer sunglasses pushed up on her head. She looks at Tyler, then at me, and says, loud enough for half the produce section to hear, some people really shouldn't bring children out in public if they can't control them. I just froze. Tyler's still crying. This woman is shaking her head at me like I'm the worst parent alive. And something inside me just snapped. Instead of yelling back or crying or leaving the store, I decided to make her shopping trip as uncomfortable as mine. She headed toward the bread aisle. Suddenly, I needed bread, too. I pushed my cart right behind her, Tyler still wailing away. She picked up whole wheat. I stood three feet away, examining the ingredient list on rye bread. She moved to check prices. I moved with her. She gave me this look and moved to the next aisle. Canned good.

Of crying with her. Of being present. What do you have, Frank? Proof that you're tough. Three sons who can't stand to be in the same room as you. Sarah started crying softly. Michael stared at his father, something unspoken passing between them. Frank grabbed his jacket. I'm leaving. No one stopped him. The door slammed. Silence. Then my aunt Sarah spoke, her voice breaking. He hasn't cried since his mother died 40 years ago. He was 19. His father told him to man up at the funeral. I think he's been trying to prove he could ever since. My mother reached across the table, squeezed my hand. Lisa would be proud of you. I nodded, tears falling freely. Now. Real men don't cry. Frank's words echoed in my head. But looking around the table at my family finally breathing, finally real with each other, I realized something. Real men do cry. They grieve, they hurt. They love openly. They show up. What they don't do is die alone, emotionally bankrupt, wondering why their children don't visit. Frank never apologized, never came back. But two weeks later, his youngest son called me. I heard what happened at Thanksgiving. Thank you. For what? For saying what we never could. He's been impossible our whole lives. I paused. It's not too late, you know, for you to talk to him. I know, he said quietly. But I don't think I can. Not while he's still that Person. Christmas came. Frank and Sarah's house was quiet. Just the two of them. My mother said Sarah invited them to join us, but Frank refused. Too proud, too stubborn. Too afraid to face what I'd exposed. Meanwhile, I hosted dinner. Michael came, brought his kids. Sarah came too. Without Frank. We talked. We laughed. We cried when someone mentioned Lisa's pumpkin pie. And it was real. Messy and painful and beautiful and real. That night, as everyone left, Michael pulled me aside. I called my dad yesterday. Told him I'd visit if he. Just talk. Really talk. No lectures, no toughness. Just honesty. He hung up on me. I'm sorry. Don't be. Michael said you were right. He chose this. He chose toughness over connection, pride over love. And now he's got exactly what he built. An empty house and a reputation. I think about Frank sometimes. About how terrified he must be of his own emotions. How exhausting it must be to perform strength every moment of every day. But mostly I think about Lisa. About how she taught me that crying isn't weakness. It's proof you love something enough to hurt when it's gone. Real men don't cry. No. Real men do. And they're stronger for it.

Then he laughed when I teared up talking about my late wife. So I asked him one question that made the whole table turn against him. Real men don't cry. My uncle Frank said it loud enough for everyone to hear. I've been talking about Lisa, my wife, how she used to make pumpkin pie from scratch every Thanksgiving, how this was the first one without her, six months since cancer took her. My voice cracked, my eyes watered, and Frank laughed. Oh, come on, you're gonna cry at the dinner table. Real men don't cry. My aunt looked uncomfortable. My cousins went quiet. My mother opened her mouth, then closed it. Frank just sat there, chest puffed out, like he'd said something profound. He'd always been this way, the tough guy, the ex Marine who never let anyone forget it. Emotions were weakness. Vulnerability was failure. He'd raised his sons with an iron fist and wondered why they never called. I wiped my eyes, took a breath. I said calmly, when's the last time one of your boys visited you? His smile faltered. What your sons? When did you last see them? The table went silent. Frank shifted in his seat. They're busy work families. Christmas, maybe, I continued. Was it Christmas or has it been longer? Frank's jaw tightened. That's none of your business. You're right, I said, but I'm curious. You've spent 30 years teaching them that. Real men don't show emotion. That crying is weakness, that vulnerability is failure. So I'm wondering, did it work? Are they strong men now? My Aunt Sarah's eyes dropped to her plate. My cousin Michael looked away. Everyone knew Frank's oldest son hadn't spoken to him in four years. The middle one called twice a year out of obligation. The youngest moved to Seattle and blamed work for never visiting. Frank's face reddened. You don't know what you're talking about. I do, actually. Lisa knew, too. Before she died, she told me something. She said, the strongest thing I ever did was cry with her, hold her hand and let her see my fear. She said it made her feel less alone. Frank scoffed. That different how I leaned forward. How is it different, Frank? She was dying. I was terrified. I cried. Does that make me weak or does it make me human? Because right now I'm wondering what makes someone so afraid of feelings that they mock a widower at Thanksgiving dinner? My mother finally spoke. Frank, that's enough. He's grieving. Frank stood abruptly. I don't have to sit here and be lectured. You don't. I agreed. Before you go, answer me this. When you're alone at night, when Sarah is asleep and it's just you and your thoughts, do you ever wonder why your sons don't call? Do you ever think maybe it's because they Learned from you that showing love is weakness, that needing someone is Failure. The room was frozen. Frank's hands trembled. You have no right. I have every right, I said quietly. I lost my wife, the woman I loved more than anything. And you know what? I have memory.

She woke up while they were checking her vitals, and Kyle immediately started asking her questions. What time do the kids go to bed? Did you wash their pajamas? Did they get screen time today or can I put on a movie? Which stuffed animals do they sleep with? What stories do they like? What setting is the sound machine supposed to be on? Do they want whole milk or 2%? His wife was lying on a stretcher about to be taken to the emergency room, and he's asking about milk preferences.

I kissed her forehead and told her to stay with her dad. Then I screenshot every single message, printed all six pages and drove to Staples to get them bound. The next morning, I walked into Principal Monroe's office before school started. I didn't make an appointment. I slammed the bound messages on her desk and said either you address this or Channel 7 News will. She started reading and her face went from annoyed to horrified. She looked up at me and said, this is completely unacceptable. I told her I wanted an emergency parent meeting that evening, mandatory. She tried to say she needed time to plan, but I wasn't leaving until she agreed. She sent the email while I stood there watching. That evening, the school cafeteria was packed. All 22 families showed up confused about why they were summoned. Their kids sat next to them. Principal Monroe introduced me and I walked to the front. My hands were shaking but my voice was steady. I read every single message out loud word for word. When I got to the garbage collector comments, I look directly at the mom who wrote them. Her face went bright red. Her daughter started crying. When I read the messages about Hazel's jacket and us renting, several kids looked confused and hurt. The room was completely silent except for my voice. When I finished, I said my husband keeps the city clean. He works harder than most people in this Room. And my daughter is the kindest, smartest kid I know. She deserved better than this. I sat down for 10 seconds. Nobody moved. Then Hazel's teacher, Missus Laura, stood up and started clapping. Slowly, other parents joined in. Not the group chat parents. They sat frozen. But at least a dozen families stood up applauding. After the meeting, a dad I'd never spoke can you came up to me. He had tears in his eyes. He said, my brother is a garbage collector in Phoenix. I'm ashamed I didn't speak up sooner. When I heard the whispers, another mom hugged me and said, we're having a pool party Saturday. Hazel is invited and so are you. Three days later, Hazel came home from school with five birthday cards from kids who hadn't been able to make it but felt terrible. The following Saturday, she went to that pool party. When I picked her up, she was soaking wet and smiling, bigger than I'd seen in months. The mean moms, their kids switched schools by winter break. Turns out nobody wanted to be friends with bullies.

I moved and triggered everything at once, slamming my body against the door, jumping in front of every sensor, creating absolute chaos. Alarms shrieked from every direction, the app probably exploding with notifications. There's a fire! I screamed over the noise. Mom was shouting at dad to find the system reset code, dad yelling he couldn't remember it, both fumbling with their phones. Smoke was pouring from Missus Lane's kitchen window now. I grabbed my metal desk lamp, eddied its heavy base solid in my hands, and started slamming it against the reinforced glass. Nothing. So I did it again. The frame started to splinter again. A crack appeared again and again and again, until the frame buckled and the glass hung loose. My parents burst in just as I was forcing my body through the jagged opening. Sophie, Stop! Mom lunged forward, then froze. Seeing the smoke billowing from next door, I hit the ground, running barefoot on wet grass, shoulder bleeding. Missus Lane's door was locked. I grabbed her garden gnome and shattered her kitchen window. The smoke poured out, black and choking. She was so light when I dragged her out, unconscious but breathing. Just as sirens filled the air. The fire captain stood in our living room, and hour later, his boots leaving ash prints on Mom's cream carpet. Three more minutes and the smoke inhalation would have been fatal. Your daughter saved that woman's life. He looked at my bandaged shoulder, then at my parents. So I've got to ask, why did she have to break through a reinforced window to get out of her room? Mom's face was pale, dad staring at the floor. The motion sensors came down that night.

My best friend Jenna has four daughters. They're 8, 6, 4, and 3 years old. Her husband, Kyle is one of those dads who looks great at birthday parties and soccer games when Jenna is standing right there. But the second she leaves him alone with all four kids, he completely shuts down. Like his brain stops working. Three weeks ago, Jenna got really sick. I brought over lasagna from Costco and garlic bread. We. We're all sitting at the dinner table eating when Jenna suddenly got up and rushed to the bathroom. The three year old jumped off her chair and ran after her mom. Then she came sprinting back, yelling that Mommy was throwing up in the toilet. All four girls bolted toward the bathroom. Kyle and I followed them. I got in there, and Jenna was hunched over the toilet looking absolutely terrible. Her face was gray and she was shaking. I grabbed a washcloth and helped her wipe her mouth, while Kyle just stood in the doorway doing nothing. I told him to go get her nausea medicine and a thermometer. He finally left, and I got Jenna sitting on the floor against the bathtub. When Kyle came back, I told him to take the kids out of the bathroom so she could breathe. He took them to the hallway. I put the thermometer in Jenna's mouth, and it read 103.8 degrees. I went to get Tylenol and water from the kitchen. When I walked back to the bathroom not even two minutes later, all four kids were crowded around their mom again because Kyle couldn't keep them in the hallway. I handed Jenna the pills and water. She swallowed them and immediately started throwing up again. Then her eyes rolled back and she passed out cold.

I spent three weeks planning Hazel's 10th birthday party. She'd finally made friends after we moved to this neighborhood six months ago, or so I thought. We decorated the entire backyard with streamers, set up a dessert table, rented a bounce house and even hired a face painter. Hazel had been so excited she could barely sleep the night before. She picked out goody bags for each kid herself, little soccer balls since her class was obsessed with the World Cup. The party was supposed to start at 1 war PM by 1:30, nobody had arrived. Hazel kept running to the front window saying, maybe they're just running late, mom. By 2:00, she came inside crying so hard she could barely breathe. She'd invited 22 kids from her fourth grade class. Not a single one showed up. I held her while she sobbed into my shoulder, asking over and over, what did I do wrong? I had no answer. My phone buzzed with a text notification. It was from a group chat called Missus Sanders's class parents that I didn't remember joining. Confused, I opened it. My stomach dropped. The messages went back 3 days. Is anyone actually going to Hazel's party? One mom wrote. Absolutely not. Another reply, why would we, someone else asked. Then came the message that made my hands shake. Her dad is a garbage collector. I don't want Skyler Around that. Imagine the smell they must have at home. The replies got worse. Trash can emojis, laughing faces. One mom wrote, I heard they rent, not own. Probably can't even afford this neighborhood. Another said, Hazel's always wearing the same jacket. So embarrassing. I couldn't believe what I was reading. These were educated adults, lawyers, doctors, real estate agents talking about a 10 year old child like us. My husband Adam worked six the hour weeks as a sanitation worker starting at 4:00am in the blazing summer heat and freezing winter cold. He did it so we could afford our house in their precious neighborhood, so Hazel could go to a good school, so we could give her opportunities. While I was reading, Hazel whispered from the couch, mom, did I do something wrong? Are they not coming because of me? That shattered me.

I own a restaurant that does catering on the side. Started it five years ago after culinary school. Built it up from nothing. Jake married my sister Rita when I was still washing dishes for minimum wage. Never supported the business. Called it a hobby that would fail. First year I was open, he showed up with 12 friends on a Friday night. No reservation, demanded the best table. Ordered everything expensive. Sent half back claiming problems that didn't exist. Bill came to $800. Family discount, right? He said I gave him 10% off. He complained to Rita that I was stingy. When I catered my cousin's baby shower, Jake ate three plates of food, then told everyone the seasoning was off. Still took home leftovers. Rida's birthday, I made a five course meal at their house. Jake critiqued every dish to his friends while eating seconds. Never said thank you. Never offered to pay for ingredients. When I won a regional cooking competition, Jake told people it was probably rigged because a judge knew Rida. The restaurant review in the paper called us the best new spot in town. Must be a slow news day, he said. But when his boss needed catering, suddenly I was the best chef in the family and he needed a favor. Did it at a cost because Rida begged. Jake took credit for Discovering me, his friends started calling for discounts. Jake said, you hook us up. I started saying no. Jake told Rita I was getting too big for my britches, forgetting where I came from. Where I came from was working three jobs to afford culinary school. The engagement announcement was at my parents house. Jake stood up during dessert. We've set the date for next June. And of course Alex will be doing the food as our gift. Everyone looked at me. I hadn't been asked. Rita looks surprised too. We haven't discussed this, I said. What's to discuss? You cater weddings. We're having a wedding for 200 people. That's a 15 thousand dollar job minimum. Exactly why we need family to help. Weddings are expensive. His parents chimed in. They were paying for everything else. Surely I could contribute this. Jake had already told everyone at their country club that his brother in law was handling the food. It would be embarrassing to change now. His mother said. I asked, what

My sister in law Kelly had her first miscarriage about six months ago. It was devastating. I get that. The whole family rallied around her and my brother Jake, bringing casseroles and giving them space to. But then she started acting like she was the only person who'd ever lost a baby. It started small. At family dinners, she'd make comments about how nobody understood what real loss felt like. When my cousin Amanda talked about her dog dying, Kelly rolled her eyes and said that's not the same thing at all. When my mom mentioned missing my grandpa who died last year, Kelly literally scoffed and said, you got to say goodbye to him. Though the worst part was how she treated me. I've been married to my husband Chris for 8 years and we don't have kids yet. Kelly started making these passive aggressive comments about how lucky I was to not have to worry about these things, how I couldn't possibly understand what she was going through. Last weekend was my nephew's birthday party. Kelly seemed okay during most of it, playing with the kids and laughing at their jokes. But then my brother's friend brought up how his wife was pregnant and Kelly's whole mood shifted. She got quiet and started picking out her food. Later when we were in the kitchen cleaning up, Kelly started talking. About how hard it was seeing pregnant women everywhere. I tried to be supportive, telling her I understood how triggering that must be. That's when she snapped. No, you don't understand, she said, her voice getting louder. You have no idea what it's like to lose a baby. You've never even been pregnant. You don't know what real loss feels like. Something inside me just broke. I've been holding this in for years, keeping it private because Chris and I decided we didn't want the whole family knowing our business. But I was so tired of her acting like she had a monopoly on grief. Actually, Kelly, I said, my voice shaking, I've had four miscarriages. The kitchen went dead silent. My mom dropped the plate she was holding. Kelly's face went completely white. The first one was three years ago. I can continued. I was 12 weeks along. We thought we were safe to tell people, but then I started bleeding at work. Chris had to pick me up from the bathroom floor. Kelly tried to say something, but I kept going. The second one was a year later. Only eight weeks that time, but it didn't hurt any less. The third one was right before Christmas Last year. I spent New Year's Eve in the hospital. The fourth one was two months ago.

I raised my hand as a joke. I helped my mom watch YouTube videos when she was pregnant with my brother. Does that count? The class laughed and I smiled, proud of my quick thinking. But Mister Gonzales wasn't smiling. His face had gone completely white, and his hands were shaking as he gripped the edge of his desk. Good. Come with me now. The entire classroom went silent. In South Dallas when a teacher used that tone. You didn't ask questions? Everyone stay in your seats. Do not leave this room. If I'm not back in 20 minutes, have someone call 9 1 1. He was already pulling me toward the door. And that's when I noticed the dark stain on his sleeve. To wet. It looked like blood. Mr. Gonzales, what's happening? Is someone hurt? I tried to pull my arm free, but his grip was iron tight. I don't think I'm qualified for whatever. You're the only one who raised their hand. He cut me off. That makes you qualified. Outside, his car was already running with the doors open. She said she had until Thursday. He kept muttering while speeding out of the school parking lot. The midwife isn't answering her phone. I the door handle, calculating if I could jump out at the next red light. Mr. Gonzalez, you're scaring me. Should I call my mom? No. He swerved. Around a car, and I slammed into the window. No one can know. Put your phone away. Turn it off! I'm not turning off my phone! I shouted. But I did anyway. We were going 50 in a 25 zone, Gonzalez kept checking his mirrors like someone was following us. Finally, he pulled into a driveway of a small yellow house that definitely wasn't his. Listen to me. He grabbed my shoulders before we got out. They can't know she was here. Do you understand? No matter what happens, they can't know. I don't understand anything! I was practically yelling now. I'm 17. I don't even have my license yet. Marco. He used my name for the first time, his voice desperate. You've kept bigger secrets than this. I know your family. I need that same silence now. He wasn't wrong. I'd already seen two drive bys this year and never said a word to the cops. But this felt different. He shoved a pair of surgical gloves into my hands. Put these on. The front door was unlocked. Inside, we followed the sound of crying to a back bedroom where a woman was curled up on a bare mattress. She looked young, maybe early 20s, with long black hair stuck to her face with sweat. It's too early, she gasped in accented English when she saw us. Then she looked at me and started crying harder. He's just a child. You brought a child? I'm 17. I Said stupid like that made any difference. I watch Grey's anatomy, if that helps. She switched to Spanish and started begging Mister Gonzalez for something I couldn't understand. He pushed me toward her. Check how dilated she is. What? I backed up so fast I knocked over.

She still thinks she's learning how to flirt. Trish started working at my waitressing job five months ago and from the moment she saw my boyfriend Kayo, she set her eyes on him like he was the last Infinity Stone. He was half Japanese like me, meaning we related on a deep level. And for some reason, Trish hated this the most. The first time she saw us having lunch, she made herself comfortable in my seat next to his. When I got up to use the bathroom, she pressed her hips against his and flashed a flirty smile before saying konichiwa. When he awkwardly set it back, she grabbed a pair of chopsticks and started eating noodles unsuccessfully complaining about whitewashed girls appropriating his beautiful culture, very obviously referring to me. When I came back from the bathroom, she told to grab a chair, telling me I was welcome to join in on their conversation. It definitely struck a nerve but I was so secure in Kaido and I's relationship, I didn't even mind until Trish started trying to implode us. She cornered him when I wasn't looking and tell him innuendo style phrases in Japanese that she got off Google translate. Whenever we were talking, she'd always squeeze past us very slowly, sometimes making sure to rub her behind against Kaido and other times facing him directly and giving him the effing eyes, the Thing that really made me mad was when she asked Kaido to come teach her Japanese at her house after work. I was going to confront her there and then, but we were in the middle of a very busy service and I told myself I'd do it right after. Big mistake. You see, at some point during service, these important Japanese business then came in for food. They were at my section, but Trish practically shoved me aside to serve them. Please speak Japanese. I understand everything, she told them. They looked pleasantly surprised and started rattling off their order with specific modifications and allergies. Trish just kept saying, hi, hi, while scribbling nonsense. 45 minutes later, it was chaos. One guy got served the wrong starter. Another received two sushi orders instead of his chicken chow Mein. And the third guy actually started having an allergic reaction to shellfish, which he asked to exclude. That's when Trish did it. While Kaido ran to get the Epipen, she pointed at me and told her cousin, who is the manager, that I changed the order to sabotage her. And without verifying anything, her cousin wrote me up on the spot in front of everyone. One more incident and you're terminated. I went home crushed and just cried to Kaido. I was wondering.

After I caught her texting her ex. I didn't say a word, just walked to the bedroom and started packing. She kept laughing from the couch. You're being dramatic, Michael. It's just texting. I pulled out my laptop, opened my banking app and started clicking. Her laughter died when she heard the notification sounds. What are you doing? Still silent. Removed her from my car insurance, canceled her phone plan that I paid for. Click. Change the Netflix password she used daily. Michael, stop. This isn't funny anymore. But I wasn't done. Logged into our shared Spotify account, change the password. Then Amazon Prime, then Hulu, then Disney plus. Every single subscription she used but never paid for. Even changed the Wi-Fi password on our router. Are you seriously going through every account right now? Next, I opened my credit card app, removed her as an authorized user. Then my gym membership, cancelled her guest privileges. My Costco card revoked her access. This is insane. You're being psychotic. I grabbed my suitcase and headed for the door. She jumped up. Panic setting in. Wait, where are you going? You can't just leave. Finally spoke. You asked what I was going to do. I'm showing you. My phone buzzed. Uber outside. Michael, I'm sorry. It meant nothing. Then, neither does this. I walked out. The Uber driver was cool, helped me load my stuff without asking Questions. We drove away. I saw her standing in the doorway still holding her dead phone, realizing she couldn't even connect to Wi Fi to call for help. 20 minutes later, my phone exploded. Her number was already disconnected since I'd cancelled the plan. But her friends started texting me. She's crying at Starbucks because she can't call an Uber without her phone plan. She tried to drive home but remembered you took her off insurance. He's asking everyone for Netflix passwords because she was watching a show. She went to the gym and they wouldn't let her in. Then came the really good stuff. Her sister called me. Michael, what did you do? Madison's at my place having a complete meltdown. I did exactly what she suggested. She says you cut off everything, her phone, insurance, streaming accounts, gym access. That's petty. Petty is texting your ex behind your boyfriend's back for two months. Two months, she said it just started. I sent her sister a screenshot of the oldest text I'd found from March. It was now may. Oh, my God, Michael, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. Her sister called back an hour later. She's been lying to everyone. I read through more of those texts. She was planning to leave you, I know, right after her ex said he wasn't ready for a relationship. So you were her backup plan. Exactly. Keep me around for bills while pursuing him emotionally. The next day I got A call from an unknown number. Madison using her mom's phone. Michael, please, I.

It's only been 11 days and the world is completely off its fucking Rocker. Charlie Kirk was killed in front of his family, David was found with a body in his car, a Ukrainian girl was stabbed on the subway, and now Elon Musk isn't even the richest man on the planet anymore. Can we chill for one second? First, Charlie Kirk got shot during a speech in Utah. He was literally in front of his wife and kids when a bullet entered his artery through his neck. The scene was so bloody and gruesome it's insane. A Ukrainian girl gets stabbed on a train in Charlotte. She escaped a literal war, came here to be safe, and still got killed because this planet has zero peace. Then D4D has a whole body in his car. Like, not a metaphorical one, an actual human body in a bag in his trunk. And this dude just casually performed like he didn't have a horror movie in his backseat. What the hell? And even outside all of that, Elon Musk is no longer the richest person in the world, losing his top spot to a rival tech CEO, showing how unstable everything feels right now, even at the highest levels. It's like every time I open my phone, reality speed runs another tragedy. Like, bro, it's been 11 days. September just started. I thought my only problem this month would be math class, but no, apparently it's Full blown world collapse. Society isn't just cooked, it's burnt to ash.

Our lead just got into an accident. The show started in less than an hour. At first I laughed. I thought it was some kind of cruel theater joke. I was just the prop guy, the one who taped broken swords, filled fake goblets, and made sure nobody tripped over stray cables. The closest I'd ever come to acting was whispering lines along with the cast from the wings. But the director wasn't joking. You've heard Mason's lines a hundred times, he said. You can do this. We open in 50 minutes. I don't even have a costume, I muttered. You do now, he said, tossing me a velvet tunic before rushing off. In the dressing room, my reflection looked like a parody of a king. With my collar crooked, sleeves too long, eyes too wide, my stomach churned. Laura, the lead actress, stormed in. You're serious? You're him tonight? Apparently. She exhaled through her nose somewhere between pity and disbelief. Alright, don't freeze. Just follow my lead. That was everyone's advice. Don't freeze. As if it were that simple. The first act was a disaster. I tripped over the hem of my robe, missed my cue, and called one of the Lords by the wrong name. The audience laughed. Not cruelly, but that made it worse. Laughter meant they knew I wasn't supposed to be there. By Act two, I'd Sweated through my costume. Lines slipped from my mind. The lights were too hot, the stage too wide, and every eye felt like a magnifying glass during a brief blackout. Laura hissed at me, get it together! You're tanking the show! I'm trying, I whispered. But the truth was, I wasn't sure I belonged anywhere near that stage. By the time Act 3 began, the play was dying a slow and painful death. Due to my lack of talent. The audience's polite smiles had turned into awkward silence. I could feel the director's glare drilling through me from the wings. Then came the big confrontation scene, which was the heart of the show. Mason used to deliver it like thunder. His voice would fill the theater. But I didn't have

My phone rang as I crossed the Oklahoma border, tears rushing down my cold cheeks. I wipe the tears from my eyes, being careful of my black eye before pressing the green answer button on my Bluetooth. Hello, I asked Sierra. Mom's cold voice came through the car speakers loud and clear. What's this I hear from your husband? You left him for another guy? I froze in my seat, my hands trembling on the steering wheel. I spotted a rest stop up ahead and pulling into the parking lot. Sitting back in my seat with a sigh. That's what he told you, I asked quietly. I didn't leave him for another guy. Of course you did. Why else would you leave such a wonderful man like him? I snorted at her words. A wonderful man like him, I repeated. Tell that to my black eye. She paused and silence fell for a long moment. All I heard was her heavy breathing. Why are you lying to me? She finally asked. I laughed again. I'm not lying. I shook my head and remembered back to the first time my husband laid his hands on me in anger. I had burned dinner that he forced me to cook for him and he thought I did it on purpose, calling me lazy and stupid. Then he slapped me across the face. I told myself I would Leave him then. But he came back and apologized, giving me flowers and promising to never do that again. The next week, he broke my arm by shoving me down the stairs once again. He felt so bad about it and doted on me lovingly for weeks during my recovery. A few months later, I had forgotten to give him a message from his boss and he ended up losing his job because he. I missed an extra day of work. He beat me almost half to death because of that one. But every time he hurt me, I would tell myself to leave. But each time he would confuse me with dates and flowers and expensive things. He would love me like I wanted to be loved. But this time he went too far. He threatened to kill me. And there was something in his eyes that made me believe him. So I ran. I shook my head to clear it. Mom, he beats me all the time. I explained I had to get away to save my life. Mom, Scott, come home. Sierra.

When I was 10, my mom marched onto the playground and pushed a kid off a swing after he cut in line and took my spot. She later grabbed his arm while he sobbed and made him apologize in front of everyone. And I just stood there watching. I mean, I thought it was normal. Mom had always been involved, but around middle school, I quickly figured out that the things she did were a little more extreme. That day, I came home with a bee on a science project she had helped me with. She was furious. She called my teacher and spent 40 minutes arguing until my teacher gave up and turned it into an A just to get her off the phone. High school was even worse. She completely edited a college application essay that one of my teachers said was already perfect and ended up getting me waitlisted. And it wasn't just school, either. When my mom found out I had a crush on a boy, she found his parents on social media and asked them to set up a date. They were instant. He creeped out and tried to politely tell her no, but that was a mistake. You see, no was the word she hated the most. She stretched her fingers and took a deep, angry breath before proceeding to hurl insults into their chat until they had no choice but To block her, just to make her stop. Rumour about my crazy mom took over the entire school and for the rest of the year people were scared to even talk to me, even my friends. But now that I graduated college and started job hunting like a real adult, I thought maybe she'd cool down and give me space. But I was so wrong. She found my resume on my laptop and changed everything. She bragged about herself in the reference section, added skills and experiences I didn't have. Even replaced the email and phone number to hers. I only found out when one company emailed her instead of me. When I confronted her, she said I was just polishing it, but some of the things she had edited actually made me sound like a terrible person instead. The worst part was when she started harassing the HR departments of the company. If I'd applied to one. Recruiter actually told me during a phone screen that my mother had called twice that week. I didn't get a second interview. She scared off two internship opportunities the same way. Calling supervisors to follow up on my behalf, sending additional materials they didn't ask for. Basically hovering so aggressively that they assumed I couldn't function independently. I begged her to stop, but called me ungrateful. I just felt bad knowing that. Nobody wants you, she told me. But she backed away after that and actually let me do things on my Own. And finally I got an interview for my dream position. The salary was great, the benefits were even better, and there was

Then she hung up. I pulled my car back onto the highway and drove the rest of the way to my parents house. I froze when I saw my husband's car in the driveway. How did he get here so fast and why was he here? My legs shook as I got out of the car and headed up to the porch. Mom opened the door and ushered me inside. Ignoring my red face and black eye, I avoided eye contact with my husband when I entered the living room to find my entire family sitting there. The only family member I actually tolerated was my oldest brother who was a cop. He sat in the recliner by the fireplace and frowned when he saw my face, glancing at my husband with a raised eyebrow. Do you want to tell us why you left him for another man? Dad asked gruffly. I glanced around the room and realized that my family have already made up their minds to believe my husband. They didn't really care about the truth. That was when I knew what I had to do. I pulled out my phone that held all the evidence my husband abused me throughout our relationship, I said calmly, pulling up pictures. I passed my family and went directly to my caught brother, handing him the proof. I've been collecting images ever since the first time he slapped me. I won't be the victim again. The truth is That I left him because he promised to kill me next time and I was afraid for my life. I ignored everyone else, staring at my brother and pleading with him to believe me. He flipped through the pictures, growing angrier with everyone. Finally, he handed the phone back to me and stood to his full height, turning to face my husband. My husband paled and stood to run, but my brother cut off his escape. I'm calling my partner, he said firmly. I'm off duty right now, but my partner is not. You're going away for hurting my sister. I cut my family off. After that, my brother had me move in with him and he cut contact with the family, too. My husband's trial was long and horrible. I had to stand up there and explain everything he did to me. But in the end, he was convicted and went away for a very long time. It took some time for me to recover, but with my brother's help, I Learned to love again.

I decided not to tell my mom about it. The morning of the interview, I told my mom I was meeting a friend for coffee before driving straight to the office building. The interview had just started and it seemed to be going great. Olivia, the current marketing director, was funny and very professional. It seems like you'd really be a great fit for the team and company, she started saying. When the doors to her office suddenly opened and my mom walked in. She didn't even knock. She just sat down in the empty chair beside me and explain and that she wanted to be there to support me and make sure I presented myself properly. She turned to Olivia and smiled sweetly, don't mind me, just continue. Olivia looked confused and tried to continue it professionally. She continued where we left off and asked me about my previous marketing experience. Before I could answer, my mom cut in. She complained that the question was too vague and told me not to answer. Olivia looked at me with wide eyes while I stared back with an apologetic look. Her jaw clenched. She tried redirecting the question back to me, but my mom kept interrupting, correcting my answers, adding details that weren't even true. She even called Olivia's questions basic and uninspired, how she expected more from a director level position. she turned to me and started asking me difficult interview questions only to Get angry. When I couldn't answer, that's when I had it. I was done. I interrupted my mom mid question and told her to leave. Her face turned red with rage. How dare you speak to your mother like this? You're clearly not ready for this job if you can't handle a simple interview, she shouted as if she were the one in charge of hiring me. Olivia stood up and pointed at the door. You're the one who's being rude. Before you stepped in, I was already practically handing your daughter a job offer before you stepped into this room and started running your mouth and taking over. But this ends here. I'm the director and you're no longer welcome here. Olivia called in security. My mom gripped the door frame, screeching about discrimination and abuse as they dragged her out. Rest gave Olivia the full picture of what I've been dealing with. She offered me the job and said anyone who could stay composed through that deserved a chance. She even helped me find temporary housing. So for three months, my life was exactly what I'd always dreamed it would be. I worked hard, made real friends, built my career without anyone interfering. But then came the court date for her trespassing charges. I thought it would be simple, just a formality until Mom's lawyer stood up and presented her evidence against me.

She started demanding to know how long this had been going on and which clients Amy had been scamming. Amy finally broke down and admitted she'd been doing it for three weeks. She was trying to save money for her boyfriend's birthday and figured no one would notice if she used the cheap supplies on clients who seemed less important. The owner immediately fired Amy on the spot. She made her leave through the back door so she wouldn't cause more of a scene. Then she personally removed my botched manicure and redid it herself using the good products. She refused to let me pay and gave me a gift certificate for three free services as an apology.

I was getting my nails done for my cousin's wedding. Nothing fancy, just a basic French manicure. The place was packed on a Saturday afternoon. Nail texts, chatting with clients, music playing, typical salon noise. I've been going to the same salon for two years and knew most of the workers. My usual girl wasn't there, so they assigned me to this new tech named Amy. Amy seemed nervous from the start. She kept looking around the salon while she worked, almost like she was scared someone would catch her doing something wrong. When I asked for the French tips, she got this weird look on her face and started mumbling about how maybe I should pick a different color instead. I thought it was strange but figured maybe she was just new and wasn't confident with French manicures yet. Then she started applying the white tips and I noticed something was off. The polish looked chunky and was separating on the brush. It was going on all streaky and uneven. When I mentioned it looked a bit thick, Amy got defensive and said that's just how French manicures look, but I'd gotten dozens of them before and this definitely wasn't right. That's when I heard whispering from the station next to me. The client was getting these gorgeous gel nails with perfect French tips that looked nothing like the mess Amy was putting On mine, I glanced over and saw the tech using completely different products, brand new bottles, expensive looking gel polish, while Amy was using what looked like old, crusty regular polish that had probably been sitting around for months. I started paying closer attention to what was happening around the salon. Three other clients were getting French manicures and they all looked perfect, clean, white tips, smooth application, professional results. Meanwhile, my nails looked like a kindergarten had painted them with craft paint. The white was bumpy, yellowing and already starting to chip at the edges. I asked Amy why mine looked so different from everyone else's. She got all flustered and said something about different nail types requiring different products. But I've had these same nails for 26 years and they've never required special chunky polish before. Something was definitely up during the drying process. I pretended to look for something in my purse, but was actually listening to Amy talk quietly with another tech.

I called my mom immediately. Turns out Emma had been planning her own wedding for the past month and had set the date for two weeks before mine to the same venue with the same photographer I booked. She'd even hired the same florist and picked similar flowers. When I confronted her, she just laughed and said great minds think alike and that she'd always dreamed of having her wedding there, too. She claimed it was just a coincidence, but I knew better. She'd literally copied my entire wedding and scheduled it right before mine so everyone would be broke and tired by the time my day came around. The worst part was how my family reacted. My aunt said I should be honored that Emma liked my ideas so much. My mom suggested maybe I could be Emma's maid of honor since it would be so sweet to have cousins in each other's weddings. I was furious. Emma had stolen my vendors, my venue, and now she wanted me to be in her copycat wedding while she completely overshadowed mine. Ben was ready to drive down there and give her a piece of his mind, but I had a better idea. I called the venue and photographer and told them what happened. Turns out Emma had name dropped me to get better deals, claiming we Were planning sister weddings together. The venue manager was horrified and immediately canceled Emma's booking she'd lied about having my permission to use my vendor relationships. When the photographer found out Emma had basically stolen his services from another bride, he backed out, too. Within 24 hours, Emma's entire wedding fell apart no decent vendor wanted to work with someone who'd scam another bride. Her boyfriend broke up with her a week later. Apparently, he'd been uncomfortable with how obsessed she was with copying my wedding. And when everything fell apart, he realized she cared more about the party than actually marrying him.

My cousin Emma was always the golden child in our family. She could sneeze and my aunt would throw her a parade. When we were kids, she'd always find ways to one up me at family events. If I got an a on a test, suddenly she was getting straight A's. If I got a new bike for my birthday, she'd get one that was better the next week. But the worst part was how she treated anyone who got close to me. Every boyfriend I brought to family gatherings would somehow end up talking to Emma by the end of the night. She'd flip her hair, laugh at their dumb jokes, and suddenly they'd be asking for her number instead of texting me back. When I turned 21, I finally decided to distance myself. I moved three hours away from my master's degree and only came home for major holidays. It was the best decision I ever made because that's where I met Ben. Ben was different from the guys I dated before. He was funny without trying too hard, smart but not arrogant about it. And he actually listened when I talked. We've been together for two years when he proposed and I was over the moon. Planning our wedding was amazing. Ben's family welcomed me with open arms. For the first time in my life, I felt like I belonged somewhere. When it came time To send out invitations, I had a really hard choice to make about my family. My mom begged me to invite Emma. She said family was family and that Emma had grown up a lot since I moved away. Against my better judgment, I sent her an invitation. Part of me hoped maybe things really had changed. Emma Rsvped yes and even offered to help with wedding planning. She called me a few times asking about details, what flowers I picked, what the venue looked like, who the photographer was. I thought she was genuinely trying to be supportive. Two months before my wedding, I was scrolling through Instagram when I saw it. Emma had posted a picture.

My sister Cassandra always competed with me. When I got promoted, she'd post about her MLM success. When I bought a house, she'd share photos of her rental like it was a mansion. But when my daughter Amelia started call, calling her stepdad, real daddy, Cassandra's jealousy turned dangerous. The first CPS report came three days after Amelia's birthday party. Someone claimed I was emotionally abusing her by restricting her diet and forcing medical treatments. I explained Amelia is type 1 diabetic and literally needs insulin injections to survive. I showed them her complete medical records and endocrinologist contact. Case closed immediately. The second report arrived two weeks later. Someone said I was severely neglecting Amelia's education because she wasn't enrolled in public school. I'm a certified teacher who home schools her for advanced abilities. I provided standardized test score. She was reading at high school level and doing eighth grade mathematics at age 7. Case dismissed again. Cassandra would text me after each investigation with 8 concern. Hey, sis, just checking how you're holding up during this difficult time. If you need any support, I'm always here. She started offering to babysit Amelia more frequently, saying I needed breaks too focus on getting my life together. The third report claimed Amelia was malnourished because she was small. Our pediatrician had to write an official letter explaining that Amelia was perfectly healthy. Just naturally petite, like my grandmother. During this investigation, Cassandra showed up with expensive groceries to help during this crisis. I caught her secretly photographing my refrigerator before restocking it, arranging everything perfectly. She even took photos of Amelia's bedroom, claiming she wanted to document the living conditions. That's when everything clicked. Cassandra wasn't just harassing me out of jealousy. She was systematically building a custody case to steal Amelia permanently. Every false report was designed to make me look while positioning herself as the stable alternative. I started watching Cassandra's parenting with her twins, Isaac and Blake. They were constantly dirty, with unwashed hair and stained clothes. I'd watch them eating candy for breakfast when I dropped Amelia off. Their dad worked overseas, leaving Cassandra alone for months. Amelia mentioned strange things after sleepovers. Cassandra would put the to bed early, then leave her watching them while she went to business meetings until after midnight. The twins would cry, asking where Mommy went. Amelia made them sandwiches and let them sleep sleep in her bed when scared. Cassandra posted about being a super mom, but her photos showed dishes piled high, laundry everywhere, kids in dirty clothes. Amelia said Cassandra spent day is crying on calls about being trapped with demon kids, while twins watch screens all day, unchanged and barely fed. My plan formed when Cassandra asked to keep Amelia for a long weekend while I apartment hunted. She'd been pushing for more overnight visits. I agreed, but Said I wanted to document everything for my court case against CPS. I gave Cassandra a detailed notebook to track Amelia's meals, activities, and bedtime. Cassandra loved this idea. She'd prove what an amazing aunt she was and help build my case. Friday, I dropped Amelia off with secret instructions to help Cassandra write everything down, including what the twins did and when Cassandra left. Sunday, pick up Cassandra.

Today, a beautiful, sexy woman has been brought in. He's already eager to cut off the woman's straps. Just at that moment, the corpse suddenly opens her eyes. Where am I? Strangely, the man appears very calm. He calmly tells Lisa, this is a funeral home. You died in a car accident. At this point, the woman recalls she did indeed have a car accident. But the woman is still confused. Why can she still speak if she's dead? Seeing that she still doesn't believe, the man has no choice but to show her death certificate. It clearly states the woman's name is Lisa. Cause of death, massive internal bleeding from a car accident. But Lisa still feels she isn't dead. She desperately begs Jack to let her go, promising to help keep the secret. But Jack pays no attention. Jack continues to suture her wounds. Strangely, Anna feels no pain at all. Just as he's halfway through the suturing, someone suddenly knocks on the door. Jack immediately takes out a vial of unknown liquid and quickly injects it into Jack's body. Lisa slowly begins to close her eyes. The person knocking is Lisa's mother. She wants to see her daughter one last time. Jack slowly pulls back the white sheet. After the mother briefly says goodbye to her daughter, she prepares to leave. Jack seems very afraid Lisa will wake up. He nervously covers her. With the white sheet, unexpectedly, the mother turns around. She tells Jack when Lisa was alive, her hair was black. She hopes he can dye Lisa's hair back to its original color. Jack readily agrees. Only after the mother has completely left does he finally relax. When Lisa wakes up on the bed, 18 hours have passed. She first feels for her pulse, but doesn't sense any beating. Lisa can't believe this is real. Could she really be dead? Meanwhile, her boyfriend arrives at the funeral home, wanting to see Lisa one last time. But Jack refuses to let him in, citing that he's not family. No matter how much the boyfriend pleads, Jack won't allow him to visit Lisa. Lisa hears her boyfriend's voice. She shouts repeatedly toward the door, but the room seems to have been specially soundproofed. Her boyfriend doesn't hear her recalling Jack's various abnormal behaviors. This makes her more convinced she isn't dead. So when Jack walks in, Lisa has secretly hidden a pair of Scissors behind her back.

But she couldn't remember what happened before her death, and her soul was trapped in this train station. Whenever she tried to leave this place, she would be blocked by a barrier. Helpless, she could only wander around the station day after day, until a year later, Lisa sat idly in the restaurant. At that moment, a panicked woman caught her attention, so Lisa sat across from the woman. From the content of her phone call, she Learned that the woman had a mental breakdown due to excessive work pressure. Lisa watched as tears slid down the woman's face. Lisa instinctively reached out her hand when the tear fell on her finger. Countless fragments of memory from her life flashed in her mind. In that moment, she remembered all her memories from when she was alive, except she still couldn't remember how she died. Lisa was confused. Her life before had been so happy. Why would she commit suicide? Just then, three familiar faces appeared on the platform. They were her parents and her boyfriend. Today was the first anniversary of Lisa's death, so her parents brought her boyfriend to lay flowers and mourn her. As they were leaving, Lisa instinctively ran forward, trying to keep them from going. Unexpectedly, a miracle happened. This time, she could easily pass through the barrier, which meant she could finally leave the train station. She suspected the disappearance of the barrier must be related to Her parents and boyfriend. After watching her parents and boyfriend say goodbye and part ways, she chose to follow her boyfriend home. Soon, she followed him to the apartment she had bought when alive. But just as they entered the community yard, she noticed the downstairs neighbor staring strangely at her boyfriend. Lisa didn't think much of it. She followed her boyfriend into the room. The newspaper reported her death by jumping in front of a train. The police determined her death was suicide because she had suffered from a long term mental illness. This confused her greatly because she had never suffered from any mental illness. However, she wasn't the only one with doubts about this case. At that moment, Jack from the transportation department was investigating Lisa's case. Although the police ultimately ruled Lisa's death a suicide, according to the records, Jack discovered Lisa hadn't left a suicide note before her death. Moreover, Lisa had climbed over a fence to enter the station that night. Obviously, this didn't seem like something a suicidal person would do. Jack stared at the station map carefully observing. Finally, he found a breakthrough point in this case.

To prevent misfortune, everyone had adhered to this agreement for many years. However, one young man didn't believe the legend. He left the village and even picked several red flowers.

But what the girl didn't know was the chef's demanding standards went far beyond this. That day, the chef demonstrated to the girl how to slice Wagyu beef. Because premium Wagyu beef requires exceptional knife skills, it can't be cut too thick or too thin. As soon as the girl picked up the knife, the chef immediately pointed out her cut was too thick. The girl felt such tension for the first time, she barely managed to make her first cut. The chef directly threw the wagyu onto the table. When she made her second cut, the girl completely panicked. Could she really not even perform a simple task like cutting meat?

They don't realize they should feed him milk. They try offering fruit, but the baby won't eat it. Then they try coconut water, almost choking him in the process. Amy watches the baby cry. As a first time mother, she has no idea what to do. She picks him up, trying to soothe him, when suddenly the baby nuzzles against her chest, finds her nipple and begins nursing hungrily. The two are surprised to learn newborns survive on milk alone. At first, Charlie struggled to accept this new life, but as time passed, he grew to adore the child. He even joined Amy in teaching him to swim. On this deserted island, swimming wasn't just a skill, it was essential for survival. The child didn't disappoint them. Soon he was swimming freely through the sea. And so under their care, the child grew up little by little. Though born on a deserted island, his childhood was surprisingly rich. Coconut shells became toy boats. Sea turtles turned into rides. Of course, sports weren't forgotten. Charlie taught him baseball, but nothing beat playing in the MUD. While they were enjoying themselves, a sailboat approached the island. The old man aboard was searching for his son lost at sea long ago. The child spotted the sailboat. Charlie looked over, nearly shouting with excitement. But after a glance at Amy, both hesitated. A brief silence fell between them and they Instantly understood each other's thoughts, they quietly LED the child away from the shore. Their retreat made the old man think it couldn't be his son, so he ordered the crew to search elsewhere. One day, Charlie took his family to a nearby island to pick bananas, asked Amy and the child to wait by the shore while he went alone to gather fruit. What Charlie didn't know was that this decision would lead them into danger. Soon after he left, the child spotted bright red wild berries. Curious, he picked a few and placed them in the boat while Amy wasn't looking. Amy noticed the wind picking up and brought the child into the boat to rest. While she dozed off, the Kyle accidentally knocked in or into the sea. Amy woke with a start. At first, she didn't grasp the danger. She only thought of retrieving the oar and paddling back quickly. But after several failed attempts, he had to call for Charlie's help. Charlie heard her and rushed over, diving into the water to grab the oar. Just then, Amy's face filled with horror. A shark was swimming straight toward him. To help Charlie escape, Amy threw the other oar toward him. Though Charlie was saved, losing their last were made their situation even more dangerous. Frustrated by its lost meal, the shark began circling the small boat. Charlie didn't want to stay trapped, swam desperately toward the oar, but the current carried them further and further. Away. After a while, Charlie realized in despair they would never make it back to shore. Helpless, the two watched the sunset together. The next morning, Amy woke to a horrifying sight. The hungry child was eating the poisonous berries. She tried to make him spit them out, but he had already swallowed them. Soon, the poison took effect. Amy knew the child didn't have much time left. Seeing this, Charlie wasn't just sad. He picked the remaining berries and divided them into two portions. At first, Amy didn't understand, but when she saw the look in Charlie's eyes, she knew what he meant. She took the other portion and they ate the berries together then, and they held each other close, waiting for the end. Sometime later, the sailboat from before discovered the small boat. They found three people lying inside. The old man still didn't realize this was his own descendant. They're dead. No, sir. They're asleep.

She cried every day, sitting before an old bucket in despair. The family was so poor, the children had no pants to wear, using wooden barrels to cover their bodies as clothes. Inside the house, the walls were bare. Everything lay in ruins. Even the fish in the tank was so starved, only bones remained. When the woman opened the cupboard, there was just one plate and a single red bean, the only food for more than 20 people. Just then, dark clouds gathered overhead. The children rushed to the dining table, ready to eat. The woman was about to drop the red bean into the pot to cook and share among them, when one child stopped her, said he wanted to plant it instead. He carried the red bean into the yard, dug a hole with a shovel, buried it, covered it with soil and watered it. Soon the ground began to swell. A red bean vine sprouted, growing taller and taller, reaching high above the clouds. The boy grabbed the vine, said goodbye to his mother, and climbed upward until he reached the sky. In the distance, he saw a giant weighing over 500 pounds. The boy hid in the clouds, watching as the giant bathed, using the clouds like a shower. After bathing, the giant returned to his palace. He pulled a spring with all his might, and an iron ball shot out like A bowling ball lamps in the house lit up as it rolled into a hole, unlocking the gate to the sky castle. Once the giant entered, the boy followed the iron ball's path and slipped inside. In the palace, the giant walked slowly toward the golden egg production room. He grabbed the hen by the neck, looked under her, but found no egg. After a few slaps, the hen explained she was on her period and couldn't lay. The giant pulled her wings. Six cherries appeared in the hen's eyes, and a pile of giant golden eggs rolled out. The giant placed them under a cutting machine. Each golden egg was sliced into fragments, then stored inside a safe. After the giant left, the boy jumped down from the window, signaled the hen to stay quiet, picked her up, and prepared to escape. The giant heard the doorbell, dropped the safe, and chased after the chicken thief. In the end, the giant caught the boy, but the hen pulled out a large hammer and struck the giant hard on the head. Seizing the chance, the boy escaped with the hen. The giant chased them out of the palace. The hen hit him again with the hammer, knocking him down. The boy slid quickly down the vine back to the ground, the giant still in pursuit. Once on the ground, the boy in the hen grabbed an axe and chopped the vine. The giant fell crashing into the earth with a Huge impact leaving a massive crater and died instantly. Boy hugged the hen and returned to his mother. Then the hen laid a giant golden egg. The mother was overjoyed. They traded their worn out shoe house for a crystal shoe house and all the children rushed into their new home. The refrigerator replaced the old cupboard and inside was an endless supply of food.

But what hatched wasn't a chick. It was a baby Dinosaur. Still, the hen raised him as her own. The Newborn Dinosaur was hungry, so hungry it swallowed all the straw in the coop. In an instant, it grew several times larger, bursting straight through the roof. After that, the hen took the Dinosaur outside and taught him to hunt for insects. The Dinosaur mimicked her movements, digging eagerly for food, but mistook tree roots for bugs and swallowed an entire tree in one gulp. Again, he grew larger than before, now big enough to act like an umbrella, sheltering the chickens from the rain. The more the Dinosaur ate, the bigger he grew, until he finally broke the farmhouse completely. The farmer stared in disbelief, then quickly called for help to take the young Dinosaur away. Left alone, the Han guarded the damaged coup, breathing and waiting at the Dinosaur Circus. Crowds came from all around, but the Dinosaur's heart remained with his mother. He began a hunger strike in protest. The circus staff thought he was sick and called a doctor, who diagnosed him with a serious illness and gave him little time left. When the Han saw the news in the paper, she rushed to the circus at once. She called out to her young one again and again, but got no response. Just As she turned to leave, the Dinosaur's eyes suddenly opened, as if by a miracle. Overjoyed, the hen embraced him tightly. In the end, they performed together under the big top and spent the rest of their lives side by side, never to part again.

So he turned and asked the little ant for help. At first, the ant didn't want to bother with him, but then an idea struck and it agreed right away. Under Donald's eager gaze, the ant crawled into the coconut. Before long, Donald began to sense something was wrong. He peeked inside only to find the little ant feasting happily all by itself. Furious, he started shouting. The little ant decided to push some leftover coconut out to him, but the hole was too small. The chunk wouldn't fit through.

Knowing a scolding was coming, the little ant quickly covered its ears to fill his stomach, Donald decided to go fishing. But with a hook and no bait, how could he catch anything? Just as he grew frustrated, he noticed the little ant nearby and a sly idea came to mind. He threw his hat into the water and pretended to panic, hoping to draw the ant's attention.

Now, as to you poor devils, so as I see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next, one, once I'm gone, you could lift that beast off the remaining spec, then carry him to the nearest town, which would be at least 37 miles back the way or two. You could unshackle yourselves, take that rifle, put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep and then make your way to a more enlightened area of this country. Choice is yours. Oh, and on the off chance there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you, The North Star is that one. Now, wait a minute, fellas, let's talk about this. You gotta be reasonable in a situation like this. I'm not a bad guy. Just, I'm just doing my job. Blueberry, didn't I give you my last apple? Tell you what, boys, take me to the dark and El Paso, I'll get you your freedom. No, no, please.

It would be an act of war. Atlantis isn't gonna do it. I'm gonna break him out myself. Arthur, Carson is looking for a reason to seize war powers.

You did try to find her because you knew if you did, Leonard Bailey would be found innocent. But you dropped the Ball, Leonard Bailey went to death row and you rather let him stay there than to admit the truth. Miss Casey, in your estimation, was Leonard Bailey innocent?

You'll change your mind when I tell you how this turn up is gonna fix the world. Okay, Imani Moore, bring it on. So this is a smart suture. It's what most American hospitals use. It's coated with sensors that are like tiny thermometers. Infection raises temperature so when your wounds heat goes up, use a smartphone technology to let your doctor we have these at our hospital. They're super cool right? Unless you live in a place where your doctors can't afford smartphones, then the smart suture is a dumb piece of thread that knows you might die but can't tell anybody. Yeah, that does seem less cool. Now switch to No. 2. No sensors, no thermometers made from a common turnip and it knows if you have an infection just as fast as the fancy one. Infection doesn't just change a woman's temperature, it also changes its P H and the natural P H level of a turn of infused suture will upon infection change colour. So when it does, you go to the doctor. See smart sutures need phones, high speed internet, 18 microscopic thermometers I just need a root vegetable and money. This could save lives. How did you come up with this? I'm a first generation immigrant doctor Goodwin surgical site infections and impoverished countries are nine times higher than in America. That's some right?

Yeah, she's just sleeping. I'm talking to my girl. I'm fine. You don't seem fine. Oh, look, we just need a moment. Say some mind to me, bro. Spencer, please, please let me handle this. I call it the season of Olivia. My photo library is a real hero. Endless pics of you and I. This is, this is bold. I mean, Spencer is literally right there. Yeah. I figured he wouldn't mind or you were hoping that he would. I mean, you could have left this at my place and instead you chose to bring it to Spencer's house. Yeah, I wanted to see you in person and this was the best way. No, you were in your feelings because I turned you down earlier. And so you drew this to put pressure on me and hopefully create drama with Spencer, which is a little surprising considering our friendship. So, what's really going on, Ashley? Cause I thought that we were friends, that we were, until I realized I wanted more. And when was that? Honestly, the feelings have probably been there this whole time, but I didn't really let myself acknowledge him. Until you left this summer. Suddenly, it was less calls, less texts. It's less you. Relationships are fleeting, Olivia, and I know that. Time doesn't wait for anybody, but occasionally it slows down long enough for you to feel something rare and intentional. That was me and you in London as friends. What Makes you so sure because time slowed down the moment Spencer and I met. And no matter the distance and no matter the setbacks, it has remained the same speed ever since. And I'm sorry for ever making you feel any different. Safe travels back to London, Ashley.

Homer got mocked at work too. After the family talked it over, Marge explained that the problem was their broken washing machine. Marge pulled out their savings and told Homer to buy a new one. But on his way to the store, Homer got distracted by the smell of barbecue, ran across the street, and was immediately hooked. The grill owner showed Homer his beehive shaped barbecue smoker made from a meteorite and said he just happened to be selling it. Homer couldn't resist and bought it on the spot, which made Marge furious. To make it up to her, Homer decided to fix everything with great food. The smoker turned out to be magical. Everything it cooked was unbelievably delicious. Even Marge was won over by the smoker, and soon the entire town was showing up for Homer's barbecue. Later, a celebrity chef challenged Homer to a cook off Homer. But just as Homer was preparing for the battle, the beehive smoker was stolen. Homer was devastated, completely losing his spirit.

 #MLBTradeDeadline #Phillies #BaseballUpdates #SportsNews#USA","usa,phillies,sportsnews,mlbtradedeadline,baseballupdates","On Thanksgiving afternoon, Marge announced it was time to take the annual Christmas photo. Everyone groaned, but Marge insisted that once they grew up, they'd understand. Flash forward 30 years, Bart and the others were all grown up. Bart couldn't even afford his rent and his ex wife had just dumped their two kids on him. The kids weren't exactly thrilled about it either. Meanwhile, Millhouse was still suffering from constant allergies, annoying everyone around him. And Bart's son was rebellious just like Bart used to be. Maggie was expecting a baby, though no one knew who the father was. Back at home, Marge got worried that the kids were coming over and to her surprise, they actually showed up. Bart found decorating the Christmas tree incredibly boring. And since Maggie couldn't teleport home while pregnant, she had to fly back on an illegal plane. Marge was thrilled. Either way, Lisa was growing more frustrated with her rebellious daughter and Marge not understanding her only made things worse. Homer, on the other hand, was excited to babysit the grandkids, even taking them to some pretty dangerous places. While riding in a car, Maggie went into labor and Nelson had to floor it to get her to the hospital. Meanwhile, Lisa and Bart had a heart to heart. Lisa was starting to wonder if she should have married Nelson after all. They still kept in touch. Bart, thanks to a court ordered behavior, chip had become oddly responsible. They both opened Up and gained a new understanding of each other. Homer was still happily dragging the kids around, and both Bart and Lisa decided it was time to reconnect with their own children. Bart called out to the giant tree to lower them back down. Lisa rushed to apologize to Marge. Bart showed his kids an old Kootis show. Maggie was still in labor and Bart couldn't understand how Homer had turned into such a good grandpa. Lisa entered the virtual world trying to reach her daughter. Inside her daughter's digital room, she discovered her daughter actually did care and they finally made up. Homer took the grandkids to visit Grandpa Abe just to prove that most kids eventually think their dads are the worst. Bart reconciled with his kids and Homer made peace with Abe. Marge and Maggie returned home with the Newborn baby. And with the help of two highly evolved pets, they finally snapped the perfect Christmas photo.

Homer quickly convinced everyone to sneak in and grab whatever they wanted. They each took their favorite items and got ready to make a break for it. But when something startled Homer, he panicked and ran off alone, causing the others to crash into each other just in time for Mr Burns to catch them in the act. Lenny tried to make a run for it but failed. Burns called a meeting to scold everyone for stealing, but surprisingly praised Homer as the only one who didn't get caught, which made everyone furious. Even during their time off, they kept texting Homer to tell him off. Homer didn't care at all, but the next morning he woke up and realized he had wet the bed. Trying to be subtle about it, he decided to do the laundry himself. Then it happened again the next night. Homer figured it must be karma. He threw a party to apologize to everyone, but still wet the bed. The next morning, he went out to buy bed wedding supplies, but accidentally triggered an alarm late at night and got mocked by the kids. Left with no choice, Homer admitted he was wetting the bed and decided to wear diapers, which Marge couldn't accept. she went out for a late night walk and ran into Professor Frank, who already knew what was going on. Turns out the whole Town knew Frank offered to help by sending everyone into Homer's dreams to find the root of his bed wedding problem. Inside the dream, they eventually discovered it was linked to his marriage. Then they fell off a cliff and Frank warned them that dying in a dream meant dying for real. They had no choice but to go deeper into Homer's subconscious. After jumping through multiple dream layers, they finally reached his deepest mental space, hoping to find answers. That's when the police barged in, trying to take the dream machine. The chaos triggered a fight between Frank and another scientist and the dream started collapsing. Amid all that, they found out Homer's mom had been living in his subconscious and the real reason for his bed wedding was an unresolved childhood issue. Once that emotional knot was untied, it was time to leave the dream. This time, they finally woke up for real and Homer didn't wet the bed. Now, that's what you call good news.

But the result disappointed me. I had been married to a rich woman for 30 years. Today was our anniversary. She gave me an expensive watch as an anniversary gift. She looked at me with expectation, but I had clearly forgotten our anniversary. Luckily, I reacted fast. I lied, saying I had planned a surprise and I would take her to get it later. She got excited when she heard that. Soon we arrived at a luxury car dealership. I picked a sports car that matched our outfits. But my 90 year old wife couldn't drive. That was exactly my plan. I pretended to be upset. I looked at her with a hurt expression. To make up for my unease, she decided to give me the car. I drove the new sports car for a spin that night. When I came home, I found another car just like mine outside. I got excited, thinking it was another surprise from my wife. But when I walked inside, I found out the truth. She was dating the car salesman behind my back. She wanted a divorce. I demanded half of everything. But she had already made me sign a prenup. I couldn't get the compensation and had to leave.

No, it's alright. No doctor says I gotta do one good deed today for my health. Come on, please, let me take that for you. Thanks. Sorry. Is you right? My name is Pete. I am an agent with the FBI. That day, I noticed something strange on the subway. A man in a hood quietly placed his backpack under a seat. Soon as the train stopped, he rushed off in a hurry. As an agent, I immediately went to check. When I opened the bag, I found a bomb inside, but I had no idea how to disarm it. All I could do is minimize the casualties, so I pulled the emergency break the passengers instantly panicked, losing all sense of order. In their fear, I saw a mother and daughter fall behind. Without hesitation, I ran over, grabbed the little girl and LED them both to safety. Just as we jumped off the car, an explosion erupted behind us. Luckily, the girl was unharmed. Through my blurred vision, I cut sight of the train's number, the number that would later become a crucial clue. When the police arrived and check the scene, they confirmed that my brain have been badly injured. Outside the police line, the crowd was packed and then I spotted him, the hooded man hiding among them. When he saw me watching him, he quickly turned and ran. I immediately gave chase. But when I rushed into a. Narrow alley. He suddenly vanished. I raised my gun and searched the area. Out of nowhere, he ambushed me. In that moment, I saw a tattoo on his waist. Then he escaped again. I tried to follow, but a car hit me at the intersection and I could only watch him disappear. A year later, I was still waking up every day at 5 in the afternoon. I had been given a special job working the night shift at the White House. That position only existed because chief of Staff far fought hard to defend me. After the subway bombing, many people believed I was the mastermind. Thankfully, far always stood in my defense. My workplace was a dark little room. I had to stay by the phone at all times. If it rang, it meant something big was happening. One night, the phone suddenly rang. Uh, yes, go ahead. Um, night action code, please. Um, pen clock, door fire. The woman's panic voice told me her uncle and aunt had just been murdered. Before it happened, her uncle had given her this number, telling her she could call if she was ever in danger. I quickly asked for her address and alerted the police. But by then, the killer had already reached her house. Her name was rose and she was terrified. I told her to run upstairs. There is a door lock from the inside. Uh, yes. Listen carefully. Lock the door. Close it, but do not go inside the. Room understand? Okay.

No, it's alright. No doctor says I gotta do one good deed today for my health. Come on, please let me take that for you. Thanks. Song raised you right. My name is Pete. I am an agent with the FBI. That day, I noticed something strange on the subway. A man in a hood quietly places his backpack under a seat. Soon as the train stopped, he rushed off in a hurry. As an agent, I immediately went to check. When I opened the bag, I found a bomb inside, but I had no idea how to disarm it. All I could do is minimize the casualties, so I pulled the emergency brake. The passengers instantly panicked, losing all sense of order. In their fear, I saw a mother and daughter fall behind. Without hesitation, I ran over, grabbed the little girl and LED them both to safety. Just as we jumped off the car, an explosion erupted behind us. Luckily, the girl was unharmed. Through my blurred vision, I cut side of the train's number, number that would later become a crucial clue. When the police arrived and checked the scene, they confirmed that my brain had been badly injured. Outside the police line, the crowd was packed and then I spotted him, the hooded man hiding among them. When he saw me watching him, he quickly turned and ran. I immediately gave chase. But when I rushed into a narrow Alley, he suddenly vanished. I raised my gun and searched the area. Out of nowhere, he ambushed me. In that moment, I, uh, I saw a tattoo on his waist. Then he escaped again. I tried to follow, but a car hit me at the intersection and I could only watch him disappear. A year later, I was still waking up every day at 5 in the afternoon. I had been given a special job working the night shift at the White House. That position only existed because chief of Staff far fought hard to defend me. After the subway bombing. Many people believed I was the mastermind. Thankfully, far always stood in my defense. My workplace was a dark little room. I had to stay by the phone at all times. If it rang, it meant something big was happening. One night, the phone suddenly rang. Uh, yes, go ahead. Um, night action code, please. Um, pen clock, door fire. The woman's panicked voice told me her uncle and aunt had just been murdered. Before it happened, her uncle had given her this number, telling her she could call if she was ever in danger. I quickly asked for her address and alerted the police. But by then, the killer had already reached her house. Her name was rose and she was terrified. I told her to run upstairs. There's a door lock from the inside. Uh, yes. Listen carefully. Lock the door, close it, but do not go inside the Room. Understand? Okay. My real goal was to mislead the killer to buy the police more time. Rose placed a mirror by the door. The killer noticed the phone was missing and he was sure his target was upstairs.

I panicked immediately. In a rush, I pried open the couch to hide the secretary inside, but she didn't know I had a wife, so she angrily refused. Seeing my wife about to come in, I grabbed the water glass from the table and knocked the secretary unconscious. Then I quickly shoved her under the couch. And what are you doing? I know this damn stuff. I'm not closing properly. Again, I just, I thought my plan was flawless, but I didn't expect my wife to say she'd already sent this couch to Jack and Jack was about to come move the couch.

But I didn't expect Jack to want to disassemble the couch before moving it. Seeing that, I hurriedly sat on the couch and pretended I couldn't bear to part with it. But inside, I was terrified.

But I didn't expect Jack to shove me aside because he wanted to rescue the woman. Seeing my secret about to be exposed, I grabbed the glass and knocked Jack unconscious. When my wife came out, she saw me cleaning up the broken glass and Jack was nowhere to be found. I lied that Jack thought the couch was too old so he didn't want it anymore.

The little girl initially thought I was joking until I told her to fetch toilet paper. After finishing, I had the older daughter empty it. That evening, when the parents returned, the girl told her mother about me using the toilet. The mother didn't believe her at all, and the father even scolded his daughter, insisting she should be an honest child. Each to next day, my behavior escalated. I smeared expired yogurt on my finger and ordered the older daughter to eat it immediately. Though reluctant, the girl obeyed out of fear. Even more absurdly, I commanded her to eat it with her hands and lick the container clean. The parents remain completely unaware of any of this. When the couple returned from work, I would hypocritically prepare dinner for the family. My actions grew increasingly bizarre after the mother left for work, I actually left the two children alone and hid. The little girl searched the entire room, but couldn't find me. Helpless, she opened the door and leaned over the stairwell, looking down. Seeing her older sister walk out, the younger brother crawled around on the floor. Suddenly, the boy started wailing he had seen me hiding under the bed. I then crawled out with a grotesque expression, making all sorts of incomprehensible faces, and even bit the boy on the shoulder. Fortunately, it was a close call, but no real harm was done. Even one day, the family went on a trip and took me along. Um, but I felt no gratitude. Seeing their wealthy, carefree life, I secretly resolved to stay in this household forever. However, the children would eventually grow up. A third child could solve this pressing problem, so I secretly searched online for remedies and added the purchased medication to their meals. I crushed the pills in a bowl and mixed them thoroughly into the family's food. My goal was to make them have a third child quickly so my job could be secure indefinitely. The plan failed because the mother, exhausted from work, went to bed early, and the father spent all his free time scrolling through his phone on the couch. Seeing the plan fail, I immediately changed my demeanor. Watching their harmonious relationship, my thoughts grew increasingly twisted. If the children grew up, or if the grandmother replaced me, I would face unemployment. The more I thought about it, the more resentful I became. E meanwhile, I privately entered the owner's room. Finally able to act without restraint, I went into the master bedroom, first engaging in strange behaviors, even fixating on dandruff on the pillows. I trashed the room, scattering garbage everywhere. I knew that as long as I cleaned up before they returned, there would be no issue. Then one day, while I was watching the children play in the park, I became careless, and the older daughter went missing. Frantically, I searched everywhere. And fortunately found her on a bench by the path. I picked her up, scolding her incessantly. Annoyed by my nagging, the little girl bit me. Uh, that bite ironically saved me once, Joe. Later, the mother noticed a bruise on her son's shoulder and asked me about it. Sensing trouble, I quickly blamed the older daughter. Even showing the bite Mark on my own shoulder is proof that the older girl had a biting habit. Once again, the mother believed me. But she didn't know the nightmare was just beginning. After the incident in the park where the older daughter got lost, another terrible idea occurred to me. If only one child remained, would the mother try for another? The next day, I lost all interest in watching the children. I took out a fruit knife I had prepared earlier and filled the bathtub with hot water. Sensing something wrong, the older daughter hid under the bed. Soon after, the mother returned from work, to a horrifying scene. I was dead. The room was in disarray, blood was everywhere, and the two children were missing.

That day, just like any other, I went to play the piano for the wife of a wealthy man. When she opened the door, I could feel that she didn't want me to come in. But since I had already taken her husband's deposit, she eventually let me in. Not long after I started playing, I smelled something strange. Following the sin, I found a dead body in the living room. Then I finally understood why she hadn't wanted to let me in. At first, I pretended to stay calm and casually said I needed to use the bathroom. As I walked through the living room, I intentionally stepped into some water on the floor so I would look more like a real blind person. Once I entered the bathroom, I realized the killer was right behind me holding a gun. I held my breath and tried not to make any movement that could expose me. Fortunately, he didn't suspect anything. When I passed the living room again, I saw the face of the dead man. Clearly, it was the wealthy man who had hired me. I forced myself to stay calm and went back to the piano to continue playing. After leaving her house, I hesitated about whether I should call the police. The man had been known for his generosity and always Tipped me whenever he hired me. In the end, I went to the police station and said I wanted to report a case. But before I could finish speaking, I saw the man who had been hiding in the bathroom. He was wearing a police uniform. I froze. He was the chief of police. Luckily, I reacted quickly and changed my story immediately, saying that my cat had been killed. The chief's eyes were cold as a knife. He had just killed a man and now the only witness was sitting right in front of him. He clearly suspected that I wasn't really blind. He insisted on taking me home himself. As soon as we arrived, he noticed a newspaper on my table. I said it was there to line the trash bin, but he obviously didn't believe me. He kept testing me. At one point, he even threw a small knife near my head. I didn't move. Fortunately, he didn't see through my act. The next day, the rich man's body was found floating by the river. His wife cried bitterly during the interview. Later, the police chief blamed the murder on a young man. I was called in to give a statement and had to listen to them fabricating the entire report. My palms were sweating. I wanted to stand up and tell the truth, but that was just a fantasy. I knew that if I spoke up, I would end up like that rich man, dead. I. Thought everything was over, but then a twist appeared. At the funeral, the man's wife kept talking about what had happened before his death, unaware that during the murder, she and the chief had overlooked someone, the old lady next door. After the funeral, that old lady went to the police and said the rich man's wife was lying. When the wife found out, she went to the old lady's house and knocked on her door. At that time, I happened to have been hired by the rich man's daughter as her private tutor. When the elevator doors open, I saw with my own eyes the rich man's wife pushing the old lady down the stairs. My legs went weak. I almost collapsed. I forced myself to stay calm and pretended I hadn't seen anything. I didn't know whether the old lady was killed because she provided evidence. But I believe that woman had gone insane. She wanted to eliminate everyone who knew the truth. I wanted to escape, but before I could step outside, someone knocked on my door.

But when we got home, he just put me on a shelf like a vase. He didn't even let me walk on the floor. On our wedding day, the guests were betting that we'd be divorced in less than a month. But we were very close. My husband climbed up on the shelf every day to talk to me. And I resolved to always present my most beautiful self to him. Sometimes I'm afraid that my yoga interrupts my husband's work. But he declared it was his work that interrupted his appreciation of my beauty. I couldn't stop smiling when I heard that. These are the most beautiful words I've ever heard. Every time he came back from a business trip, he would bring me a gift. Sometimes it's a diamond bracelet weighing 100 grams and flowers flown in on the same day from a foreign country. I hugged the bouquet as if it were my happiness. After that, I tried harder to dress up. I wanted to look my best when my husband came home. But on our anniversary, my husband didn't bring any gifts. He just gave me a kiss. I was happy, but my smile seemed forced. The nanny casually asked if I hadn't received any gifts today. I replied that a kiss was worth all the presents. But the look on my face revealed my disappointment. I thought my makeup was not to my Husband's liking. So I put on my husband's favorite dress. But this time my husband didn't even look at me and just focused on his work. I tried to talk to him, but only received a perfunctory reply. I was a bit upset, so I sang my husband's favorite song. But my husband asked me to keep quiet. I was so upset, but I held back my tears because tears would ruin my makeup. The next day, I was still dressed up. I put on an expensive dress in the hope that my husband would look at me. Instead, he complained the glare from the sunlight hindered his work and summoned the nanny to reposition the desk. What are you. What's going on? What? Change of scenery. Natural light's better for my eyes. This time, I let the tears run down my face. Even if my makeup was ruined, it mattered not, for in my husband's eyes, I no longer existed. Three years had passed and I was still looking good. I wanted to hear praise from my husband, but all I got in return was a cold, slamming door. It broke my heart. I took off one of my heels and resolved to leave. But when I looked down, the platform, which had been less than three meters high, was now an abyss. Living on a shelf for so long had given me a special fear of the ground. I threw down my heels and it took me a Long time to hear the echo. It made me breathe a little harder. But even so, I plucked up the courage to let go of my hands.

That day, just like any other, I went to play the piano for the wife of a wealthy man. When she opened the door, I could feel that she didn't want me to come in. But since I had already taken her husband's deposit, she eventually let me in. Not long after I started playing, I smelled something strange. Following the scent, I found a dead body in the living room. Then I finally understood why she hadn't wanted to let me in. At first, I pretended to stay calm and casually said I needed to use the bathroom. As I walked through the living room, I intentionally stepped into some water on the floor so I would look more like a real blind person.

Fortunately, he didn't suspect anything. When I passed the living room again, I saw the face of the dead man. Clearly, it was the wealthy man who had hired me. I forced myself to stay calm and went back to the piano to continue playing. After leaving her house, I hesitated about whether I should call the police. The man had been known for his generosity and always Tipped me whenever he hired me. In the end, I went to the police station and said I wanted to report a case. But before I could finish speaking, I saw the man who had been hiding in the bathroom. He was wearing a police uniform. I froze. He was the chief of police. Luckily, I reacted quickly and changed my story immediately, saying that my cat had been killed. The chief's eyes were cold as a knife. He had just killed a man and now the only witness was sitting right in front of him. He clearly suspected that I wasn't really blind. He insisted on taking me home himself.

After the funeral, that old lady went to the police and said the rich man's wife was lying. When the wife found out, she went to the old lady's house and knocked on her door. At that time, I happened to have been hired by the rich man's daughter as her private tutor. When the elevator doors open, I saw with my own eyes the rich man's wife pushing the old lady down the stairs. My legs went weak. I almost collapsed. I forced myself to stay calm and pretended I hadn't seen anything. I didn't know whether the old lady was killed because she provided evidence. But I believe that woman had gone insane. She wanted to eliminate everyone who knew the truth. I wanted to escape, but before I could step outside, someone knocked on my door.

To ensure their nutrition, various fruits and vegetables were placed in the tank. Seeing that lunch was secured, the cannibals excitedly danced with joy. However, Jack suddenly came up with an idea. He gently kicked the side of the tank with his foot, but the tank didn't move at all. Instead, the flames beneath it grew fiercer. Realizing that his strength alone was limited, he immediately surfaced, calling to Lena to join him in diving underwater. The two of them began to work together, kicking the steel walls of the tank, trying to use inertia to shake the tank and overturn it. After their efforts, the tank began to sway from side to side. However, at that moment, the water inside the tank was gradually heating up. If this continued, they would soon be cooked alive. To save their lives, they couldn't afford to hesitate. They dove back under the water, this time using all their strength, desperately shaking the tank. In the next second, the tank was finally overturned by the two of them. A huge amount of broth and water poured out. The tank rolled down the slope. The two successfully escaped the pursuit.

At first, I had no idea what was happening. When I finally found a water source, I drank without hesitation. The next second, I was back in the desert. This cycle continued for 300 years. I finally figured it out. The problem was with that water source. This time, I chose to walk straight across the water without drinking a drop. The curse didn't trigger. I found a highway and flagged down a car to get home. The driver handed me a bottle of water and parched as I was, I drank it. Immediately, tragedy struck again. I was back in the desert. The water in the bottle had turned to sand. Fuck. To get home, I dragged my exhausted body back to the highway after flagging down the same car. I refused the water the driver offered and finally made it home. Lying on the couch, I heard the sound of dripping water. Only then did I realize I hadn't drunk water in hundreds of years. I turned on the tap and filled a glass to the brim, even adding a few ice cubes. After my experience with eating sand, I was extra cautious this time. I dipped my finger in and tasted a drop. I waited. Nothing happened. I continued carefully tasting it with my finger. Still nothing perfect. I down the entire glass in one go. Thinking the curse was broken, I jumped straight into the Pool outside. Just as I was savoring the moment, a mouthful of sand nearly choked me. I broke down. What the hell did I do wrong? Driven by sheer determination, I made my way back to the city once more. Looking at the bustling streets, I suddenly remembered once someone dying of thirst had asked me for water and I refused. I quickly stopped a passing woman and asked if she could spare me some water. She refused, saying the water was for her dog. The next second, she vanished. I knew where she'd gone.

Even when I'm working out, a few drops leak out. I hold it in. The rest of the time, I keep myself busy inside the prison, working hard. And finally, on this day, lunch comes with soybeans. I swallow them all in one gulp. When the warden walks in for inspection, I fake a choke, spit the soybeans back out. One shot. Get this damn convict away from me. Get in firmery. The doctor takes one look at me and quickly makes a diagnosis. One injection would cure it, but I've drunk so much water that I can't hold it anymore. The doctor hands me a bedpan. I laugh and tell him this thing is way too small. I need 10 of them just to get through. That's when another inmate steps in and offers to take me to the toilet. So we walk over. What nobody knows is that inside this tiny cubicle, there's a hidden passage. I climb up on the toilet, tell the inmate to stand guard at the door, and I pull out a tool I hit earlier. Done taping off, I unlock the white phone. Once I'm inside, I shut it back down, making it look like nothing ever happened. Passage leads straight to the tool room. We take out a wooden plank, slide it underneath the truck. The moment the truck rolls out, we slip into the hollow Space inside the plank. When the vehicle passes through the checkpoint, the scanners don't pick up the thing. Then at a gas station stop, we crawl out, ditch the plank and bolt toward our friend's car. Just like that, we make it out of prison alive. But inside the car, the woman driving keeps stealing glances at me.

At first, he thought something was wrong with him, but then he saw dead animals everywhere. When he returned to his car, his girlfriend was gone. It was then that he realized the world's oxygen had disappeared. After a simple farewell to his girlfriend, he began searching for survivors. He first found a house where dripping clothes proved someone was inside. After pushing the door open, he met a woman who had also survived. He showed her that he meant no harm and they communicated using sign language. The woman decided to leave with him. They collected the remaining oxygen tanks. The man looked at the woman's oxygen tank, then his own, silently praying that the worst would not happen. So they rode an electric scooter, continuing their search for other survivors. The road was littered with bodies and their hearts were filled with grief. They climbed a mountain and set off a smoke bomb, but received no response. Just then, fireworks suddenly burst in the sky. They followed the direction of the fireworks and eventually arrived at a house, but the people inside were already dead. Fireworks had been set up beforehand. Seeing this, they fell into despair. The woman took off her clothes, intending to have one last Dance with the man to bid farewell to the world. The man's oxygen was running out. He prepared to put on his last tank. The woman saw her oxygen tank was also almost empty. She questioned the man, who replied he was powerless to help. The instinct to survive LED her to fight with the man. A deer head decoration fell from the wall and the man fell to the floor. Ultimately, he was stabbed in the heart and lost his life. The woman in the end, couldn't escape the same fate of losing oxygen.

But when we got home, he just put me on a shelf like a vase. He didn't even let me walk on the floor. On our wedding day, the guests were betting that we'd be divorced in less than a month. But we were very close. My husband climbed up on the shelf every day to talk to me. And I resolved to always present my most beautiful self to him. Sometimes I'm afraid that my yoga interrupts my husband's work. But he declared it was his work that interrupted his appreciation of my beauty. I couldn't stop smiling when I heard that. These are the most beautiful words I've ever heard. Every time he came back from a business trip, he would bring me a gift. Sometimes it's a diamond bracelet weighing 100 grams and flowers flown in on the same day from a foreign country. I hugged the bouquet as if it were my happiness. After that, I tried harder to dress up. I wanted to look my best when my husband came home. But on our anniversary, my husband didn't bring any gifts. He just gave me a kiss. I was happy, but my smile seemed forced. The nanny casually asked if I hadn't received any gifts today. I replied that a kiss was worth all the presents. But the look on my face revealed my disappointment. I thought my makeup was not to my Husband's liking. So I put on my husband's favorite dress. But this time my husband didn't even look at me and just focused on his work. I tried to talk to him, but only received a perfunctory reply. I was a bit upset, so I sang my husband's favorite song. But my husband asked me to keep quiet. I was so upset, but I held back my tears because tears would ruin my makeup. The next day, I was still dressed up. I put on an expensive dress in the hope that my husband would look at me. Instead, he complained the glare from the sunlight hindered his work and summoned the nanny to reposition the desk. What are you. What's going on? What? Change of scenery. Natural light's better for my eyes. This time, I let the tears run down my face. Even if my makeup was ruined, it mattered not, for in my husband's eyes, I no longer existed. Three years had passed and I was still looking good. I wanted to hear praise from my husband, but all I got in return was a cold, slamming door. It broke my heart. I took off one of my heels and resolved to leave. But when I looked down, the platform, which had been less than three meters high, was now an abyss. Living on a shelf for so long had given me a special fear of the ground. I threw down my heels and it took me a Long time to hear the echo. It made me breathe a little harder. But even so, I plucked up the courage to let go of my hands.

The neighbor quickly informed the old woman's husband of the situation. Yet the old man also seemed completely bewildered. Shortly after, the old man took his wife to the hospital for an examination. But after leaving the hospital, he secretly made a bold decision in his heart. He then contacted his children, who hadn't returned home for years, hoping to have one final reunion and share a warm meal together.

This scene was witnessed by an old friend of the family who couldn't stand the way the old man's children were behaving. Just as he was about to scold them angrily, his own wife stopped him. The old father saw it all, his heart aching, but he could do nothing. He could only invite his old friend To drink with him to numb the pain. But as soon as they started, the eldest daughter in law complained they were being too loud. The old man had to gesture silently to keep things quiet. They say children are the light of one's later years. But the sons and daughters before him had long seen their parents as a burden they trampled all over years of parental love and sacrifice, unaware that this would be the last time they would see their parents. The family gathering ended hastily. The mother, suffering from alzheimer's, looked at her children and grandchildren around her. Though she couldn't remember all their names, deep in her mind she knew they were her beloved family, tears well up in her eyes. How she wished her children would visit more often. With great effort, she said, hearing their mother talk incoherently. The children simply turned and left, leaving the lonely old couple watching them go. Afterward, the old man carefully washed the dishes, collected the dried clothes from the line, and tidy the house one last time under the lamplight. His wife was unusually quiet, not restless or noisy. The old man couldn't understand why his and his wife's life had been so hard. His lifelong partner first developed alzheimer's, and now she had late stage intestinal cancer. Their children, busy with their own lives, rarely visited. The old man collected scrap to make ends meet while caring for his sick wife. Apart from basic expenses, He never spent a penny unnecessarily, saving all the extra money for his youngest daughter. Yet every time she came, she wouldn't even step inside. She took the money and left without a second glance. Now his wife's condition was critical. Watching her take handfuls of painkillers daily with little relief, the old man wished he could bear the pain for her.

You don't have to do this. You can change your mind. Don't do that. Please don't do that. Don't move. Stay still. Please. Just stay. Don't. Please. Just stay still. Don't move. Please. Please. When the woman finally calmed down, David noticed that she actually didn't want to die. He quickly called the conductor, asking him to evacuate all the passengers from the train car. Then he tried to reassure the woman, telling her he meant no harm. It's okay. My name is David. What's yours? David said that his own child was also on the train. You have children? Yes, I do, too. His words gradually calmed Nadia. He slowly approached her and offered to help. Just then, the voice of the SWAT team came from the train car. D. S. David, but specialist Protection, don't shoot. We know who you are. Stand clear. It's alright. I'm not going anywhere. Just stay very still. No, Nadia. It turned out the police had already deployed snipers at the next station. But David knew very well that any sudden move could set off the bomb. She's cooperating. She intends to surrender. She does not intend to activate the device. Get expo here. He asked the SWAT team to hold off on any action and turned back to continue comforting Nadia. It's alright. It's okay. I'm not going anywhere. Finally, Nadia revealed the truth. She had been forced Into this by her husband. At that moment, the snipers had already taken aim at the restroom. Get out of the fucking toilet. No. David suddenly spread his arms wide, shielding Nadia behind him. He slowly turned his body, blocking the snipers line of sight. No clean shot available. Repeat, no clean shot available. The police had no choice but to call in a bomb disposal expert. Daddy, I'm gonna step to the side. I'll be right. During the entire defusing process, David stayed by Nadia's side until the explosive vest was successfully removed. In the end, David escorted Nadia off the train and the man who had forced her was arrested. It's over. You're safe now. No one's gonna hurt you.

The little girl initially thought I was joking until I told her to fetch toilet paper. After finishing, I had the older daughter empty it. That evening, when the parents returned, the girl told her mother about me using the toilet, but the mother didn't believe her at all. And the father even scolded his daughter, insisting she should be an honest child. Each to next day, my behavior escalated. I smeared expired yogurt on my finger and ordered the older daughter to eat it immediately. Though reluctant, the girl obeyed out of fear. Even more absurdly, I commanded her to eat it with her hands and lick the container clean. Parents remain completely unaware of any of this. When the couple returned from work, I would hypocritically prepare dinner for the family. My actions grew increasingly bizarre. After the mother left for work, I actually left the two children alone and hid. The little girl searched the entire room but couldn't find me. Helpless, she opened the door and leaned over the stairwell, looking down, seeing her older sister walk out. The younger brother crawled around on the floor. Suddenly, the boy started wailing. He had seen me hiding under the bed. I then crawled out with a grotesque expression, making all sorts of incomprehensible faces and even bit the boy on the shoulder. Fortunately, it was a close call, but no real harm was done. Even one day, the family went on a trip and took me along. Um, but I felt no gratitude. Seeing their wealthy, carefree life, I secretly resolved to stay in this household forever. However, the children would eventually grow up. A third child could solve this pressing problem. So I secretly searched online for remedies and added the purchase medication to their meals. I crushed the pills in a bowl and mixed them thoroughly into the family's food. My goal was to make them have a third child quickly so my job could be secure indefinitely. The plan failed because the mother, exhausted from work, went to bed early and the father spent all his free time scrolling through his phone on the couch. Seeing the plan fail, I immediately changed my demeanor. Watching their harmonious relationship, my thoughts grew increasingly twisted. If the children grew up or if the grandmother replaced me, I would face unemployment. The more I thought about it, the more resentful I became. E meanwhile, I privately entered the owner's room. Finally able to act without restraint, I went into the master bedroom first engaging in strange behaviors, even fixating on dandruff on the pillows. I trashed the room, scattering garbage everywhere. I knew that as long as I cleaned up before they returned, there would be no issue. Then one day, while I was watching the children play in the park, I became careless and the older daughter went missing. Frantically, I searched everywhere. And fortunately, found her on a bench by the path. I picked her up, scolding her incessantly. Annoyed by my nagging, the little girl bit me. That bite, ironically, saved me once Joe. Later, the mother noticed a bruise on her son's shoulder and asked me about it. Sensing trouble, I quickly blamed the older daughter. Even showing the bite Mark on my own shoulder is proof that the older girl had a biting habit. Once again, the mother believed me, but she didn't know the nightmare was just beginning. After the incident in the park where the older daughter got lost, another terrible idea occurred to me. If only one child remained, would the mother try for another? The next day, I lost all interest in watching the children. I took out a fruit knife I had prepared earlier and filled the bathtub with hot water. Sensing something wrong, the older daughter hid under the bed. The soon after, the mother returned from work to a horrifying scene. I was dead. The room was in disarray. Blood was everywhere, and the two children were missing.

No, it's all right. No. Doctor says I gotta do one good deed a day for my health. Come on, please. Let me take that for you. Thanks. Sorry. Is you right? My name is Pete. I am an agent with the FBI. That day, I noticed something strange on the subway. A man in a hood quietly placed his backpack under a seat. Soon as the train stopped, he rushed off in a hurry. As an agent, I immediately went to check. When I opened the bag, I found a bomb inside. But I had no idea how to disarm it. All I could do is minimize the casualties, so I pulled the emergency brake. The passengers instantly panicked, losing all sense of order. In their fear, I saw a mother and daughter fall behind. Without hesitation, I ran over, grabbed the little girl, and LED them both to safety. Just as we jumped off the car, explosion erupted behind us. Luckily, the girl was unharmed. Through my blurred vision, I cut side of the train's number, the number that would later become a crucial clue. The police arrived and checked the scene. They confirmed that my brain had been badly injured. Outside the police line, the crowd was packed. And then I spotted him, the hooded man hiding among them. When he saw me watching him, he quickly turned and ran. I immediately gave chase. But when I rushed into a Narrow alley. He suddenly vanished. I raised my gun and searched the area. Out of nowhere, he ambushed me. In that moment, I saw a tattoo on his waist. Then he escaped again. I tried to follow, but a car hit me at the intersection, and I could only watch him disappear. A year later, I was still waking up every day at five in the afternoon. I had been given a special job working the night shift at the White House. That position only existed because chief of Staff Farr fought hard to defend me. After the subway bombing, many people believed I was the mastermind. Thankfully, Farr always stood in my defense. My workplace was a dark little room. I had to stay by the phone at all times. If it rang, it meant something big was happening. One night, the phone suddenly rang. Uh, yes, go ahead. Um, night action code, please. Um. Pen. Clock. Door. Fire. The woman's panicked voice told me her uncle and aunt had just been murdered. Before it happened, her uncle had given her this number, telling her she could call if she was ever in danger. I quickly asked for her address and alerted the police. But by then, the killer had already reached her house. Her name was rose, and she was terrified. I told her to run upstairs. It is a door lock from the inside. Uh, yes. Listen carefully. Lock the door, close it, but do not go inside the Room. Understand? Okay. My real goal was to mislead the killer. To buy the police more time. Rose placed a mirror by the door. The killer noticed the phone was missing, and he was sure his target was upstairs. Just as I expected, he stormed toward the bathroom first, pounding furiously on the door. I whispered to rose to stay still, but the killer quickly realized the trick and then turned toward her bedroom. Rose, it's okay. You're safe now. When I heard the police, I finally let out a sigh of relief. Rose threw herself into the officer's arms. She noticed the glass window behind her was open. That meant the killer had already escaped. I reported everything to FAR. She ordered me to bring rose back right away. Before I could move, the deputy director of the CIA showed up. He wanted to take rose with him. When rose Learned the man worked at the White House, her expression instantly changed. That was when I arrived. The deputy director didn't like FAR, but her authority was higher than his. There was nothing he could do. I took rose to my place. I asked her to change into fresh clothes. Then I locked my phone in the safe and set a camera on the desk. I had to make sure my suspicions were right. After that, I took rose and left. Just then, FAR called me. She worried about Rose's safety, but even more, she worried about whether anyone had contacted Her. Before hanging up, she ordered me to protect rose at all costs. But the moment I ended the call, a car came speeding straight at us. Keep your head down! Get down! Stay low!

I panicked immediately. In a rush, I pried open the couch to hide the secretary inside, but she didn't know I had a wife, so she angrily refused. Seeing my wife about to come in, I grabbed the water glass from the table and knocked the secretary unconscious. Then I quickly shoved her under the couch. And what are you doing? I know this damn cell phone not closing properly. Again, I just, I thought my plan was flawless, but I didn't expect my wife to say she'd already sent this couch to Jack and Jack was about to come move the couch. No sooner had she finished speaking, then there was a knock at the door. At that point, I plan to wait until Jack moved the couch outside and I would figure out a way to take the secretary away. But I didn't expect Jack to want to disassemble the couch before moving it. Seeing that, I hurriedly sat on the couch and pretended I couldn't bear to part with it. But inside, I was terrified. Luckily at that moment, our son started crying upstairs. I quickly asked my wife to go feed the baby in the bedroom. As soon as my wife left, Jack tried to take the couch apart. I rushed over and held the couch down. I lied that my secret savings were hidden inside it so the couch had to Be moved out intact. And as a middle aged man, Jack really understood how I felt. So he agreed without hesitation. But while we were moving it, my wife interrupted me again. She remembered she had a few clothes inside the couch. To avoid making her suspicious, I had to offer to help her get the clothes. I thought I was careful enough not to be discovered. But to my surprise, Jack glanced inside the couch. Hey, what the hell? What? Just a bunch of spiders. You get scared enough. Thankfully at that critical moment, the baby cried again upstairs. Hearing it, my wife had to go back to the room. Meanwhile, Jack saw the woman lying underneath. He wanted to pull her out to save her. But I frantically held the couch down and pulled out cash to give him, trying to get him to help me cover up the truth. But I didn't expect Jack to shove me aside because he wanted to rescue the woman. Seeing my secret about to be exposed, grab the glass and knocked Jack unconscious. When my wife came out, she saw me cleaning up the broken glass and Jack was nowhere to be found. I lied that Jack thought the couch was too old so he didn't want it anymore. I thought that lie would fool my wife. Then I went to work planning to deal with the two people in the couch. After I finished, little did I know my actions Made my wife suspicious. And when she lifted the couch up, the scene before her startled her.

Along the way, Calvin asked the driver where he should throw the chicken bones. The driver casually rolled down the window and said, just toss them out here. Seeing this, Calvin laughed and, like the driver, threw all the bones out of the window. At the next traffic light, a girl was standing nearby. Calvin smiled and gave her a friendly wave. If, but who could have imagined that just a few months earlier, Calvin had been a completely different person. Once, just because his wife had offered water to two laborers, Calvin had angrily thrown the cup into the trash. His wife saw this helplessly but said nothing because Calvin was the only one earning in the family. Calvin worked at a bar. Sometimes to impress his boss, he would secretly take belongings from VIP customers and later return them himself, pretending to be a hero just to earn praise or a reward. One day he got into a fight with some important guests, people with big connections. The bar shut down soon after and Calvin lost his job. He now had to find a new way to make money.

The pianist's name was Doctor Shirley. Doctor Shirley asked directly, do you have a problem working for a black man? Calvin replied, no, sir, I just need to earn money. It doesn't matter to me. Doctor Shirley said, I don't just need the driver, I need an assistant, someone who can take care of everything, polish my shoes, wash my clothes, keep track of my schedule. Calvin found that a bit strange, but then said, alright, I'll do it if I'm paid 1, 350 out month and you don't call me a servant. Doctor Shirley agreed. Shirley had to perform shows in the southern parts of America, so Calvin became his driver and they set out on a long journey together. Along the way, many people discriminated against Doctor Shirley because he was African American. But every time Calvin stood up for him. Calvin was no longer the same man he used to be. He had changed.

That day, just like any other, I went to play the piano for the wife of a wealthy man. When she opened the door, I could feel that she didn't want me to come in. But since I had already taken her husband's deposit, she eventually let me in. Not long after I started playing, I smelled something strange. Following the scent, I found a dead body in the living room. Then I finally understood why she hadn't wanted to let me in. At first, I pretended to stay calm and casually said I needed to use the bathroom. As I walked through the living room, I intentionally stepped into some water on the floor so I would look more like a real blind person. Once I entered the bathroom, I realized the killer was right behind me holding a gun. I held my breath and tried not to make any movement that could expose me. Fortunately, he didn't suspect anything. When I passed the living room again, I saw the face of the dead man. Clearly, it was the wealthy man who had hired me. I forced myself to stay calm and went back to the piano to continue playing. After leaving her house, I hesitated about whether I should call the police. The man had been known for his generosity and always Tipped me whenever he hired me. In the end, I went to the police station and said I wanted to report a case. But before I could finish speaking, I saw the man who had been hiding in the bathroom. He was wearing a police uniform. I froze. He was the chief of police. Luckily, I reacted quickly and changed my story immediately, saying that my cat had been killed. The chief's eyes were cold as a knife. He had just killed a man and now the only witness was sitting right in front of him. He clearly suspected that I wasn't really blind. He insisted on taking me home himself. As soon as we arrived, he noticed a newspaper on my table. I said it was there to line the trash bin, but he obviously didn't believe me. He kept testing me. At one point, he even threw a small knife near my head. I didn't move. Fortunately, he didn't see through my act. The next day, the rich man's body was found floating by the river. His wife cried bitterly during the interview. Later, the police chief blame the murder on a young man. I was called in to give a statement and had to listen to them fabricating the entire report. My palms were sweating. I wanted to stand up and tell the truth, but that was just a fantasy. I knew that if I spoke up, I would end up like that rich man, dead. I. Thought everything was over, but then a twist appeared. At the funeral, the man's wife kept talking about what had happened before his death, unaware that during the murder, she and the chief had overlooked someone, the old lady next door. After the funeral, that old lady went to the police and said the rich man's wife was lying. When the wife found out, she went to the old lady's house and knocked on her door. At that time, I happened to have been hired by the rich man's daughter as her private tutor. When the elevator doors open, I saw with my own eyes the rich man's wife pushing the old lady down the stairs. My legs went weak. I almost collapsed. I forced myself to stay calm and pretended I hadn't seen anything. I didn't know whether the old lady was killed because she provided evidence. But I believe that woman had gone insane. She wanted to eliminate everyone who knew the truth. I wanted to escape, but before I could step outside, someone knocked on my door.

She worried about Rose's safety, but even more, she worried about whether anyone had contacted her. Before hanging up, she ordered me to protect rose at all costs.

A diver surfaced and as soon as he took off his oxygen mask, felt a suffocating sensation in his throat. He quickly put his mask back on. At first, he thought something was wrong with him, but then he saw dead animals everywhere. When he returned to his car, his girlfriend was gone. It was then that he realized the world's oxygen had disappeared. After a simple farewell to his girlfriend, he began searching for survivors. He first found a house where dripping clothes proved someone was inside. After pushing the door open, he met a woman who had also survived. He showed her that he meant no harm and they communicated using sign language. The woman decided to leave with him. They collected the remaining oxygen tanks. The man looked at the woman's oxygen tank, then his own, silently praying that the worst would not happen. So they rode an electric scooter, continuing their search for other survivors. The road was littered with bodies and their hearts were filled with grief. They climbed a mountain and set off a smoke bomb, but received no response. Just then, fireworks suddenly burst in the sky. They followed the direction of the fireworks and eventually arrived at a house, but the people inside were already dead. Fireworks had been set up beforehand. Seeing this, they fell into despair. The woman took off her clothes, intending to have one last Dance with the man to bid farewell to the world. The man's oxygen was running out. He prepared to put on his last tank. The woman saw her oxygen tank was also almost empty. She questioned the man, who replied he was powerless to help. The instinct to survive LED her to fight with the man. A deer head decoration fell from the wall and the man fell to the floor. Ultimately, he was stabbed in the heart and lost his life. The woman in the end, couldn't escape the same fate of losing oxygen.

No, it's alright. No. Doctor says I gotta do one good deed today for my health. Come on. Please let me take that for you. Thanks. Song is you, right? My name is Pete. I am an agent with the FBI. That day, I noticed something strange on the subway. A man in a hood quietly placed his backpack under a seat. Soon as the train stopped, he rushed off in a hurry. As an agent, I immediately went to check. When I opened the bag, I found a bomb inside. But I had no idea how to disarm it. All I could do was minimize the casualties, so I pulled the emergency brake. Aku! The passengers instantly panicked, losing all sense of order. In their fear, I saw a mother and daughter fall behind. Without hesitation, I ran over, grabbed the little girl, and LED them both to safety. Just as we jumped off the car, an explosion erupted behind us. Luckily, the girl was unharmed. Through my blurred vision, I cut side of the train's number, a number that would later become a crucial clue. When the police arrived and check the scene, they confirmed that my brain had been badly injured. Outside the police line, the crowd was packed. And then I spotted him, the hooded man hiding among them. When he saw me watching him, he quickly turned and ran. I immediately gave chase. But when I rushed into A narrow alley. He suddenly vanished. I raised my gun and searched the area. Out of nowhere, he ambushed me. In that moment, I saw a tattoo on his waist. Then he escaped again. I tried to follow, but a car hit me at the intersection, and I could only watch him disappear. A year later, I was still waking up every day at five in the afternoon. I had been given a special job working the night shift at the White House. That position only existed because chief of Staff Farr fought hard to defend me. After the subway bombing, many people believed I was the mastermind. Thankfully, Farr always stood in my defense. My workplace was a dark little room. I had to stay by the phone at all times. If it rang, it meant something big was happening. One night, the phone suddenly rang. Uh, yes, go ahead. Um, night action code, please. Um. Pen. Clock. Door. Fire. The woman's panic voice told me her uncle and aunt had just been murdered. Before it happened, her uncle had given her this number, telling her she could call if she was ever in danger. Quickly asked for her address and alerted the police. But by then, the killer had already reached her house. Her name was rose, and she was terrified. I told her to run upstairs. Does a door lock from the inside? Uh, yes. Listen carefully. Lock the door, close it, but do not go inside the room. Understand? Okay. My real goal was to mislead the killer. To buy the police more time. Rose placed a mirror by the door. The killer noticed the phone was missing, and he was sure his target was upstairs. Just as I expected, he stormed toward the bathroom first pounding furiously on the door. I whispered to rose to stay still, but the killer quickly realized the trick and then turned toward her bedroom. Rose, it's okay. You're safe now. When I heard the police, I finally let out a sigh of relief. Rose threw herself into the officer's arms. She noticed the glass window behind her was open. That meant the killer had already escaped. I reported everything to FAR. She ordered me to bring rose back right away. But before I could move, the deputy director of the CIA showed up. He wanted to take rose with him. When rose Learned the man worked at the White House, her expression instantly changed. That was when I arrived. The deputy director didn't like FAR, but her authority was higher than his.

But one day I noticed an old scar on my stomach. It looked exactly like a C section cut. I panicked and searched online. I saw real post surgery photos. The scar matched perfectly. My hands were shaking. I ran to ask my mother. She calmly said it was from a car accident. She told me to stop overthinking. That night, I dreamed of something strange. I saw a four year old child and a husband with a blurred face. I woke up confused. Before I could think it through, something even stranger happened. I went to a school for a teacher interview. The principal said my diploma cannot be found online. He accused me of faking my degree. He rejected me on the spot. I tried to explain I wasn't lying, but nothing worked. I left full of anger and shame. I searched my home looking for documents to prove my degree. No matter how hard I searched, guy found nothing. I asked my mother again. She said I threw them away before my accident. I refuse to believe it. No one would throw away something that important. As I kept looking, my mother suddenly clutched her chest. I rushed her to the hospital, but she refused treatment. She made me promise one thing. First, to give up becoming a teacher. I hesitated, but I agreed for her sake. Still, deep inside, I felt she was hiding something. I told everything to my new friend, Ali. He stayed quiet, then took me to my old school records office. But no matter how he searched, there was no record of me ever studying there. My chest tightened. Maybe after my accident, my mother had been hiding the truth from me. I gave Ollie my only graduation photo. I asked him to help me uncover the truth. But before he could even look closely, my mother walked in. She was furious. She said I didn't trust her. I explained again and again. After a long talk, she finally calmed down. But from that day, I only met Ali in secret. We studied the photo together. One day, he found another copy online. He compared it to mine. Mine had clearly been altered. And in the yearbook, there was no Aisha. Instead, the name was Alice. Shaken with doubt, I went straight to my mother. I demanded to know about the photo. It got emotional. She swore she knew nothing about photo editing. But I didn't believe her. This time, I was sure she was lying. She cried and yelled, calling me paranoid. Then suddenly, a knock on the door. A beautiful woman walked in. She called my mother mom. She called me sister. I froze in place. I had no memory of ever having a sister.

It was so tight she could barely breathe. Today was supposed to be her wedding day, but a guard secretly slipped a dagger into her waistband. The princess was utterly confused by this, but she would soon understand why. As the wedding ceremony came to an end, the Prince swept her up in his arms. Just as Anna was lost in blissful happiness, the prince suddenly hurled her off the cliff. Fortunately, the valley below was thick with branches and foliage, which saved Anna from a deadly fall. Darkness and terror surrounded her. She screamed for help in rage and desperation, but her cries accidentally awakened a sleeping dragon at the bottom of the cliff. As roaring flames came rushing toward her, Anna ran for her life. She barely managed to duck into a cave, only to get her ankle tangled in debris. With a second wave of flames approaching fast, she fought desperately to break free. Thankfully, she only suffered burns to her skin. To survive, she used the dagger to cut strips from her dress and bandaged her wounds. Then, carrying a flaming torch, she bravely ventured into the dark depths of the valley. Fortune seemed to smile upon her. Anna quickly found melting icicles. She tilted her head back and drank deeply, then slowly closed her eyes in exhaustion, completely unaware that danger was creeping closer. When she opened her eyes again, the icicles had already Turned into blazing flames, Anna quickly ducked back into the cave, once again dodging the dragon's attack. By sheer luck, she also discovered an opening that LED to the outside world, though the cave walls were covered with razor sharp crystals, like a deadly trap waiting to spring. But driven by her will to survive, Anna tore her dress into strips, braided them into a rope, and began climbing with determination. Just when she thought she was about to escape, the dragon's roar echoed from the valley below. Startled, she lost her footing and nearly plummeted to the bottom. Fortunately, she managed to hook her crown onto a crystal, leaving her body suspended in midair. But the fragile crystal couldn't support her weight and shattered instantly. She plummeted straight down as the dragon opened its massive jaws, waiting for its prey to fall in. However, Anna didn't give up. With her last ounce of strength, she used her crown to hook onto the rock wall again. In this desperate moment, she found incredible strength within herself and climbed frantically upward, finally reaching the cave opening. But her hope was instantly crushed. Outside, the opening was nothing but a sheer drop. Seeing villagers passing far below, she waved frantically and shouted for help, but they couldn't hear her at all. Instead, she only attracted the dragon's attention. The warning signs on the walls and the scattered bones nearby seemed to silently tell her there was no way out of this place. Just as Anna closed her eyes and waited for death to come, a familiar voice suddenly shattered the darkness.

As soon as he boarded the plane, he secretly poured a small bottle of vodka into his juice. Seeing no one watching, he added another bottle of liquor, then expertly tossed the empties in the trash before taking a satisfying sip of his spiked orange juice. A head flight attendant caught a whiff of alcohol but was clearly used to it. The only one shocked was the copilot. This was his first time flying with this captain and his face showed complete disbelief. What he didn't know was that the captain was already drunk before boarding. Soon reeking of alcohol, the captain passed out cold. Judging by the head attendant's reaction, this clearly wasn't the captain's first time pulling this stunt. Fortunately, the flight remained smooth and their destination grew closer. The co pilot took control and began preparing for landing. That's when disaster struck. The cabin started shaking violently, terrifying both passengers and crew. Only the newly awakened captain remained calm. The co pilot discovered the plane's elevators seem to have malfunctioned. The captain calmly instructed the attendants to reassure passengers. But the next second, the plane suddenly went into a steep nose dive. A flight attendant who hadn't made it back to her seat was thrown across the cabin. The co pilot frantically pulled the speed brakes, but the plane kept plummeting. Every passenger in the cabin held their breath. The captain immediately contacted air traffic control to report An emergency landing, but at their current descent rate, their chances of survival were basically zero. To slow the plane, the captain quickly dumped fuel, but it didn't help. The plane was heading straight for the ground. That's when the captain made a shocking decision, would flip the plane upside down. The copilot was stunned, speechless. After asking the head attendant to pass on his final words to his son, the captain immediately began the inversion maneuver. The cabin started tilting. Neither passengers nor crew had any idea what was about to happen. With help from the copilot and head attendant, the captain retracted the landing gear and completed the inversion just 2,600 feet from the ground. Jesus, fuck shit. Although the inversion stopped the dive temporarily, dumping fuel had killed the engines. They couldn't make it to the airport and the engines caught fire. With no time to think, the captain made a bold call, find an emergency landing spot. He managed to flip the plane back upright, but both engines were completely dead. They were just gliding in the open field ahead. A church suddenly came into view. Despite the captain's desperate attempts to adjust, he could only watch helplessly as one wing clipped the church. In that moment, everyone in the cabin was powerless, silently awaiting their fate. Luckily, the plane wasn't going fast by then and thanks to the captain's cool headed decisions, most passengers survived the crash. The captain woke up again. He was lying In a hospital bed watching the news footage, he still didn't know how many had survived. That's when his buddy Mike walked in. He told the captain that without his perfect flying skills, no one would have made it out alive. Out of 102 people on board, 96 survived. Two flight attendants and six passengers died. The outcome was nothing short of a miracle. But trouble came knocking soon enough. After he recovered and left the hospital, his lawyer told him that while the crash was due to mechanical failure, the hospital had taken blood samples from all crew members. The results were damning. He'd been flying drunk. Plus, investigators found two empty vodka bottles on the plane. Getting caught doing this meant prison time. Some said if it wasn't for the captain's incredible flying skills, so many wouldn't have survived. Others said if he hadn't been drunk, no one would have died at all. In the end, the man owned up to his mistakes and face the consequences.

En medio del pánico, intenté llamar para pedir ayuda, pero el teléfono se me resbaló de las manos y cayó en una grieta entre las rocas. Desesperado, saqué un cuchillo, corté la herida e intenté succionar el veneno mientras aún conservaba la conciencia. Corrí con todas mis fuerzas hacia casa. Apenas crucé la puerta, caí en la cama y mi conciencia se desvaneció poco a poco. No sé cuánto tiempo pasó, pero cuando desperté de repente, no solo seguía vivo, sino que la herida había sanado por completo. Aún así, decidí ir al hospital. Pero algo extraño ocurrió. Mi coche estaba cubierto de una gruesa capa de polvo, como si hubiera estado allí parado por semanas. No le di importancia. Encendí el motor y conduje hacia la ciudad. Pero cuando llegué, las calles estaban vacías. Reinaba un silencio absoluto. Comida y objetos estaban esparcidos por el suelo, como si todos hubieran huido. Lo peor de todo, había cadáveres en el camino. Aún en estado de shock, vi un cartel, un aviso de evacuación de emergencia. Mi corazón dio un vuelco. Algo muy grave había ocurrido. Corrí de vuelta al coche, encendí la radio buscando respuestas y la verdad me dejó sin aliento. Había estado inconsciente durante 4 semanas completas. Durante ese tiempo, un virus letal se había extendido por todo el mundo y casi toda la humanidad había sido aniquilada. Conduje hacia las vegas en busca de sobrevivientes. La electricidad seguía funcionando, pero la Ciudad estaba vacía, los letreros de neón parpadeaban en el vacío y y el silencio me oprimía el pecho. Pasé varios días buscando alguna figura humana, pero no encontré a nadie. Al borde de la desesperación pisé el acelerador decidido a acabar con todo, pero en ese momento un perro apareció de repente en medio del camino. No sé cómo, pero también había sobrevivido y sin saberlo me salvó la vida. Lo llevé conmigo, lo llamé lucky. Empezamos de nuevo juntos. Comencé a leer muchos libros sobre supervivencia, mecánica y medicina, cualquier cosa que pudiera ayudarme. Poco a poco aprendí a vivir en un mundo vacío. Solo lucky y yo, hombro con hombro, pasamos todo un año hasta aquel día cuando vi humo elevándose en el horizonte

But during the college entrance exam, I couldn't even move my pen. Because in every test before, Tony had always helped me answer the questions. But that day, Tony got stuck in traffic. Looking at my incomplete hands, I suddenly felt completely helpless. I didn't want my three years of hard work to go to waste. So I tried to flip open the paper with my mouth and bite the pen just to write my name. But no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't do it. When the exam ended, I was filled with despair. In a fit of hopelessness, I went straight to the rooftop. At that moment, I wanted to end my miserable life. Because before the exam even started, when Tony still hadn't shown up, I tried asking strangers passing by for help. But not a single person was willing to lend a hand. In the end, I placed my last hope on the Proctor. But to my shock, even the teacher gave up on me. Now I no longer have the right to blame anyone. What made it worse was that the minister of the Interior's daughter decided to go shopping that day. So she used her father's power to block off the roads, which accidentally trapped Tony halfway. By the time Tony finally reached school, it was already too late. As he rushed desperately toward the rooftop, he heard the screams of the crowd. Below. Because I had chosen to end my life in this. Tony was devastated. At the same time, my brother also arrived. He had gotten my message asking for help. But he too was stuck in traffic. He had even asked a police officer by the roadside for help. But the officer's response left him heartbroken. And just like that, death separated me and my brother forever. But my brother wanted to seek justice for me. So he went straight to the police station to report the minister's daughter. Yet when the chief heard his words. He just gave a subtle signal to his men. Quietly pass the message to the minister. Little did he know. That same night, my brother was kidnapped by gangsters. And brutally tortured to death. In this city, the minister's word was law. He wouldn't allow anyone to threaten his power. But there was one man who couldn't stand the evil. And that man was Tony.

He accidentally touched the maid's butt, saying he just wanted to know how big her hips were. To his surprise, the maid cooperated, unexpectedly lifting her skirt without even looking back. And just like that, on an otherwise ordinary afternoon, Jack experienced his first transformation in life. From that moment on, he became bolder. One day, he saw the maid carrying things and went up to help as they passed through the doorway. The entrance was too narrow, so he took the opportunity to lean his head against the maid. The maid didn't resist. Then Jack pushed the maid down, saying he just wanted to know how many layers her skirt had. Seeing through Jack's intentions, the maid generously removed her clothes and gave in to him. After these two experiences, Jack started imitating other men's actions. He trapped another maid who had just delivered food to him against the door. From then on, every maid in the manor knew him. Every night they would line up outside Jack's room to chat.

I wanted to steal it while he was unconscious. But suddenly he woke up and grabbed my hand. Thank you. I was confused but also thrilled. Then I showed off the watch to my coworkers. Little did I know I would soon regret it deeply. When I got back to the lounge and took out the watch to admire it, I noticed the words Cherish Time engraved on the back, but I didn't care at all. I put it on without hesitation. The moment I did, the hands of the watch started spinning wildly. At first, I thought it was broken, so I tried to fix it, but nothing worked. Just then, my coworker walked in. The shock on his face made me realize something was wrong. He handed me a mirror and I couldn't believe my eyes. In just 10 minutes, I had aged 10 years. Seeing my wrinkled reflection, I instantly realized the watch was the cause. I tried to take it off, but no matter how hard I pulled, it wouldn't budge. Then I thought of the homeless man, so I ran straight to his hospital room. But something strange had happened again. The frail old man had turned into a young guy. Take back your damn watch now. no, man. I'm not falling into that trap again. Okay, don't you. Takey, can you hear me? I can. Hear you alright, but your hearing is about to get worse. Told you thanks for rescuing me. Wait, wait, wait. Okay, I get it. What do I do now? How does it even work? I wish I knew, man. I stole this watch from a guy yesterday morning and now I get why he didn't start chasing me anyway, since I nearly died today, you have about a day to live. Good luck. After hearing what he said, I was so terrified I collapsed in just half a day. My body was 60 years old. I knew I couldn't keep wearing the watch. So I told my coworker to break my arm to get it off. But just as he was about to swing, something eerie happened. The watch vanished into thin air before I could even breathe in relief. It appeared on my left hand and the hand spun even faster. That's when I realized brute force wouldn't work. Only someone else could remove it for me. So I walked down the hallway trying to give it away, but everyone refused to take it. Just when I thought I was doomed to die, a woman rushed in with her dying father asking for help. I saw a glimmer of hope and ran toward them. I told the woman to get a doctor while I tried to use the old man's hand to remove the watch. But suddenly the man's heart stopped. I panicked and started CPR immediately. Luckily, after A few moments, he began breathing again. My coworker stared in shock. I turned young again. I grabbed a mirror to confirm it, and the watch dropped to the floor on its own. It turned out you had to do a good deed to remove it. When I looked at the back of the watch again, I finally understood that time is truly priceless.

But after examining me for half an hour, the doctor told me I didn't need any treatment. He said it would get better if I just stayed away from my husband for a while. I tried to explain that I've been divorced for years and I hadn't dated anyone since then. But the doctor didn't believe me. He thought I was lying. No matter how much I tried to explain, the doctor stuck to his diagnosis. The next day, I came back. This time my stomach was hurting, and after doing an ultrasound, the doctor told me I'd had a miscarriage. Now I was really pissed off. I don't even have a husband. But the doctor still wouldn't believe I was single. He couldn't wrap his head around it because the test results don't lie. After making some quick notes about my case, he just turned and walked away. But guess what? I was back again on the third day. This time my neck was hurting, and after checking me out, the doctor said it was a hickey. I told him I'd already looked it up online, and I was sure it was an early sign of cancer. The doctor was getting frustrated. He still thought I was making things up. I kept telling the doctor I didn't have a husband and I hadn't had a boyfriend in ages. Seeing how insistent I was. He pulled out a couple strands of my hair, planning to run some kind of psychological test to see if maybe I'd gotten a boyfriend without being aware of it. But I stood my ground. The doctor went ahead and tested my hair, but the results came back totally normal. He thought I might have split personality disorder, so he asked me how I've been sleeping. I told him I slept just fine, except I always woke up feeling exhausted and worn out. And my ex husband, who lives downstairs, he'd been calling me lately, wanting to get back together after hearing all this. But the doctor seemed to have figured something out. He had me spend the night in the hospital sleep lab the next day looking at my brain waves. He noticed they became extremely active after midnight. That's a classic sign of sleepwalking. The truth finally came out. Turns out I've been sleepwalking to my ex husband's place every night, which explained the pregnancy and the hickey. The doctor suggested I just go home and remarry the guy, joking that I couldn't even keep my ex out of my dreams. Then he prescribed me some medication to help treat my sleepwalking problem.

He was all set to go on a road trip with his family. As soon as they hit the highway, he turned on the cruise control and set the speed to a 1 twenty kilometer H. He proudly claimed that it was the most advanced cruise control system. Once the speed was set at, the car would drive itself without the need to touch the accelerator pedal. But just as they got going, something went wrong with the cruise control system. The on board computer completely froze and could be restarted. Tomato hit the brakes, trying to exit cruise mode, but nothing happened. The car kept speeding at 120 km each. At first, his family thought tomato was just joking around and trying to scare them. But as the traffic grew heavier and tomato had to swerve dangerously several times to avoid collisions, they started to panic. At that moment, Tomato's father David came up with an idea. He said he had heard that cruise control could be turned off by pressing the rest button, so he told tomato to give it a try. Tomato hesitated, but pressed the RES button. Car responded by increasing speed instead of turning off cruise control. David refused to give up. He told tomato to try again, press the RES pedal fully, then release it, then press it again. But instead of shutting down, the car accelerated to its top cruise speed. Tomato quickly called His salesman Daniel asking what to do in such a situation. But Daniel was busy with another customer and didn't want to deal with it. Annoyed, he sarcastically replied open the door, stick your foot out, and stop it yourself, then hung up the phone. Tomato's face turned red with anger. By now, he was acting completely frantic. Up ahead, traffic was getting worse, and tomato kept switching lanes to avoid crashing. Everyone in the car was trembling with fear. Then suddenly three cars appeared side by side, blocking the road. To avoid hitting them, tomato swerved sharply into a service area, but as soon as he did, their car crashed into a parked BMW.

Instinctively, I rushed forward to stop him, warning that there was something in the drink. The man glanced at her suspiciously, and then he seemed to understand everything. His face darkened. He grabbed the woman by the arm and forced the entire bottle down her throat. But she didn't swallow. Instead, when he started gloating, she spat the drink right back into his mouth. The man blinked twice, then his eyes rolled back and he collapsed on the floor. Sorry, I, I didn't know that he. Do not apologize. If you're better, help me to get him into the stall. Come on. We dragged his body into the stall. Moments later, his bodyguard showed up. He saw the shoes under the stall door, thinking the boss was still inside. Once he left, we climbed out through the window and escaped. I took the woman back to my place, pulled some cash from behind the fireplace and told her to take it and run. But she shook her head, pushed the money back into my hands and whispered that she was going back to her husband tomorrow. That's when I realised. The man was actually her husband. She said she just wanted one day away from that abusive man to live as herself. He slowly took off her jewelry and walked toward me. Step by step, my heart was in chaos. By dawn, I finally asked her name. She didn't answer, only said softly, there's something in the drink. Before I could react, everything went black. When I woke up, the room was empty as if nothing had happened. But I knew she had been here and I understood I had to get her back. A few days later, I told a friend about it, but he didn't believe me. He said no woman would drug her husband just to spend a night with a stranger. But fate is funny. I saw her again. She was with her husband at the same restaurant. Without hesitation, I walked up to her, reached out my hand and asked her to come with me. She looked at me coldly and said she didn't know me. Her husband smirked, thinking I was just another admirer. I pulled out the ring she had left behind. His face changed instantly. I knew what had happened that night, but he didn't get angry. He thought she would never leave a rich man like him. He raised his glass, taunting me to drink with him. But the woman suddenly tossed the ring into his glass. He didn't notice and swallowed it in one gulp. A second later, he started Choking while she ran straight toward me. And that's when I finally understood she had made up her mind to leave that arrogant man and live a life that truly belonged to her.

Seeing the unclaimed stamp on the letter, I didn't give up. If the first letter wasn't received, I'd send a second one. If the second wasn't received, I'd keep writing. I persisted and eventually, after hundreds of rejected letters, he finally accepted one and agreed to meet me in prison. The returned letter had the words, you went on.

I faced the man who'd caused me so much pain, thought I'd come to accuse him so he couldn't look me in the eye and kept apologizing. But what he didn't expect was I wasn't there to scold him. Instead, I asked him how life was in prison, like a wife concerned about her husband. This confused him. What happened next was even more shocking.

But after the rapist was imprisoned, I made a decision no one could understand. I wrote to him asking to visit him in prison. However, the letter was rejected and returned. Seeing the unclaimed stamp on the letter, I didn't give up. If the first letter wasn't received, I'd send a second one. If the second wasn't received, I'd keep writing. I persisted and eventually, after hundreds of rejected letters, finally accepted one and agreed to meet me in prison. The returned letter had the words, you went on. It seemed I'd moved him with my persistence. A year after the incident, I finally met the man who violated me. I faced the man who'd caused me so much pain, I thought I'd come to accuse him so he couldn't look me in the eye and kept apologizing. But what he didn't expect was I wasn't there to scold him. Instead, I asked him how life was in prison, like a wife concerned about her husband. This confused him. What happened next was even more shocking.

Every time I see couples being affectionate on TV, my eyes fill with jealousy. Then I unhappily turn it off because I know no one could ever accept a mouth like mine. Since birth, I've been laughed at. Even posting a selfie would get flagged as inappropriate and taken down. Because of this, I've always felt deeply insecure. I keep a cherished diary where I collect pictures of beautiful lips. Sometimes I tear a poster and tape the lips onto my face, imagining how beautiful I would look if I had a normal mouth. Today is my 20th birthday. I finally gathered the courage to go to a restaurant, but when the waiter saw me, he couldn't help but laugh. I'm used to that reaction. Calmly, I took out a funnel from my bag, slipped the plastic tube into my pants, and I poured food into the funnel so it could flow down into my stomach. I ate quickly and was about to leave. But just as I walked out of the restaurant, a group of thugs snatched my utensils, threw my precious notebook on the ground, and even tried to take pictures to post online. Furious, I grabbed my bag, kicked one of them away, and ran back to my car to escape. I cried the whole way while driving. Suddenly, there was a loud bang. Panicked, I looked outside and realized I had Accidentally hit a boy strangely. The boy smiled with satisfaction. Maybe he liked me. What do you guys think

That day, just like any other, I went to play the piano for the wife of a wealthy man. When she opened the door, I could feel that she didn't want me to come in. But since I had already taken her husband's deposit, she eventually let me in. Not long after I started playing, I smelled something strange. Following the scent, I found a dead body in the living room. Then I finally understood why she hadn't wanted to let me in. At first, I pretended to stay calm and casually said I needed to use the bathroom. As I walked through the living room, I intentionally stepped into some water on the floor so I would look more like a real blind person. Once I entered the bathroom, I realized the killer was right behind me holding a gun. I held my breath and tried not to make any movement that could expose me. Fortunately, he didn't suspect anything. When I passed the living room again, I saw the face of the dead man. Clearly, it was the wealthy man who had hired me. I forced myself to stay calm and went back to the piano to continue playing. After leaving her house, I hesitated about whether I should call the police. The man had been known for his generosity and always Tipped me whenever he hired me. In the end, I went to the police station and said I wanted to report a case. But before I could finish speaking, I saw the man who had been hiding in the bathroom. He was wearing a police uniform. I froze. He was the chief of police. Luckily, I reacted quickly and changed my story immediately, saying that my cat had been killed. The chief's eyes were cold as a knife. He had just killed a man and now the only witness was sitting right in front of him. He clearly suspected that I wasn't really blind. He insisted on taking me home himself. As soon as we arrived, he noticed a newspaper on my table. I said it was there to line the trash bin, but he obviously didn't believe me. He kept testing me. At one point, he even threw a small knife near my head. I didn't move. Fortunately, he didn't see through my act. The next day, the rich man's body was found floating by the river. His wife cried bitterly during the interview. Later, the police chief blamed the murder on a young man. I was called in to give a statement and had to listen to them fabricating the entire report. My palms were sweating. I wanted to stand up and tell the truth, but that was just a fantasy. I knew that if I spoke up, I would end up like that rich man, dead. I. Thought everything was over, but then a twist appeared. At the funeral, the man's wife kept talking about what had happened before his death, unaware that during the murder, she and the chief had overlooked someone, the old lady next door. After the funeral, that old lady went to the police and said the rich man's wife was lying. When the wife found out, she went to the old lady's house and knocked on her door. At that time, I happened to have been hired by the rich man's daughter as her private tutor. When the elevator doors open, I saw with my own eyes the rich man's wife pushing the old lady down the stairs. My legs went weak. I almost collapsed. I forced myself to stay calm and pretended I hadn't seen anything. I didn't know whether the old lady was killed because she provided evidence. But I believe that woman had gone insane. She wanted to eliminate everyone who knew the truth. I wanted to escape, but before I could step outside, someone knocked on my door.

The little girl initially thought I was joking until I told her to fetch toilet paper. After finishing, I had the older daughter empty it. That evening, when the parents returned, the girl told her mother about me using the toilet. The mother didn't believe her at all, and the father even scolded his daughter, insisting she should be an honest child. Each to next day, my behavior escalated. I smeared expired yogurt on my finger and ordered the older daughter to eat it immediately. Though reluctant, the girl obeyed out of fear. Even more absurdly, I commanded her to eat it with her hands and lick the container clean. Parents remain completely unaware of any of this. When the couple returned from work, I would hypocritically prepare dinner for the family. My actions grew increasingly bizarre. After the mother left for work, I actually left the two children alone and hid. The little girl searched the entire room but couldn't find me. Helpless, she opened the door and leaned over the stairwell, looking down. Seeing her older sister walk out, the younger brother crawled around on the floor. Suddenly, the boy started wailing. He had seen me hiding under the bed. I then crawled out with a grotesque expression, making all sorts of incomprehensible faces and even bit the boy on the shoulder. Fortunately, it was a close call, but no real harm was done. Even One day, the family went on a trip and took me along. Um, but I felt no gratitude. Seeing their wealthy, carefree life, I secretly resolved to stay in this household forever. However, the children would eventually grow up. A third child could solve this pressing problem. So I secretly searched online for remedies and added the purchased medication to their meals. I crushed the pills in a bowl and mixed them thoroughly into the family's food. My goal was to make them have a third child quickly so my job could be secure indefinitely. The plan failed because the mother, exhausted from work, went to bed early and the father spent all his free time scrolling through his phone on the couch. Seeing the plan fail, I immediately changed my demeanor. Watching their harmonious relationship, my thoughts grew increasingly twisted. If the children grew up or if the grandmother replaced me, I would face unemployment. The more I thought about it, the more resentful I became. E meanwhile, I privately entered the owner's room. Finally able to act without restraint, I went into the master bedroom first engaging in strange behaviors, even fixating on dandruff on the pillows. I trashed the room, scattering garbage everywhere. I knew that as long as I cleaned up before they returned, there would be no issue. Then one day, while I was watching the children play in the park, I became careless and the older daughter went missing. Frantically, I searched everywhere and Fortunately found her on a bench by the path. I picked her up, scolding her incessantly. Annoyed by my nagging, the little girl bit me. Uh, that bite, ironically, saved me once Joe. Later, the mother noticed a bruise on her son's shoulder and asked me about it. Sensing trouble, I quickly blamed the older daughter. Even showing the bite Mark on my own shoulder is proof that the older girl had a biting habit. Once again, the mother believed me, but she didn't know the nightmare was just beginning. After the incident in the park where the older daughter got lost, another terrible idea occurred to me. If only one child remained, would the mother try for another? The next day, I lost all interest in watching the children. I took out a fruit knife I had prepared earlier and filled the bathtub with hot water. Sensing something wrong, the older daughter hid under the bed. The soon after, the mother returned from work to a horrifying scene. I was dead. The room was in disarray. Blood was everywhere, and the two children were missing.

As soon as I pulled it, Kevin's cold stare was fixed on me. He put on a mask and lunged toward me. When I woke up, I was locked in a sealed room. The man who kidnapped us walked in. He was dressed in black with thick glasses. Before sitting down, he wiped the chair. Clearly, he was a neat freak. Kevin's eyes scanned all three of us. They realized her skirt was too short. She nervously tugged it down. Out of nowhere, Kevin grabbed her and carried her out. I choose you first. It's only gonna be a minute. Pee on yourself. Pee on yourself! She struggled, but it was no use. Marcia banged on the door, frantic. It was locked. We heard terrible screams from outside. We thought Claire was finished. The next second, Kevin shoved her back in. He shook his hands, disgusted. Claire had wet herself. Terrified the germophobe wouldn't even touch her now. That gave us an idea, too. We thought about doing the same, but Kevin shoved us into the bathroom. He warned us not to mess around again. Then you for sacred food, and I promise not to bother you again. The words sacred food made My blood run cold. Was he some kind of cult guy? Were we going to be sacrifices? We heard high heels clicking in the hallway. We pressed our faces against the door crack. A woman walked past. Outside, we screamed for help. We're here! Help us! We're in here! No, no, no, no! Don't go in there! Don't go in there! We thought we were finally saved. The door opened.

I screamed in pain. For ordinary people, this might just be trivial, but for someone with misophobia, it was as disgusting as dipping your hand in cow dung. My name is Anna, and I suffer from severe mysophobia. I only wear white clothes every day and don't allow a single stain on them. I have to disinfect any surface before sitting down, and even when opening a window, I put on gloves first. If my hands are accidentally touched by someone else, I immediately rush to the bathroom to wash them. I squeeze out two pumps of hand sanitizer each time and have to wash my hands for a full 20 minutes. Every time I turn off the faucet, I feel my hands are dirty again, so I wash them once more. I wash my hands up to 100 times a day. I carry a hair dryer with me everywhere, and whenever someone touches my hair, I rush into the bathroom right away, take out the shampoo I've prepared in advance, and wash my entire hair thoroughly. What's even more absurd is that I'm a researcher who has to work with microorganisms every day. I think the air is full of bacteria, so I disinfect my office daily, which often leads to complaints from the cleaning staff. Extreme mysophobia severely disrupted my life, so I went to a hospital for treatment. That's where I met all kinds of patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. There was an uncle who frantically calculated numbers. No matter how difficult the problem was, he could figure out the answer in just one second. There was an aunt who compulsively checked her belongings, and once she couldn't find something, she would become extremely restless, staying in a state of high emotional tension all the time. There was also a man who would never step on the lines on the ground when walking. Besides that, the man also suffered from symmetry OCD. Every item had to be placed symmetrically. Since the doctor hadn't arrived yet, everyone Learned about each other's situations. So the man suggested we treat each other, forming a mutual aid group for patients. However, soon after, an accident happened.

Don't drink blood. Not afraid of sunlight either. I feed on people's energy by chatting with them. All I have to do is talk about annoying, boring topics, their energy gets drained. I can also drain people by making them angry. Same effect. Actually, you probably know an energy vampire in real life, because we're the most common type among vampires. And I can also drain other vampires energy. Pretty cool. So every morning after I wake up, I go find my vampire roommate and use him as my breakfast. Yemo, get him out of here! Would you get out of here? Please get out! Please get out! That's what I call my morning cup of coffee after I'm recharged. I had to work at a human company. Then I find opportunities to chat with co workers. That's how I feed all day. Today a new employee came to the company. I was excited, immediately went up to talk to her. But strangely, I talked a whole lot, didn't drain anything from her. She became even more energized. I immediately stopped the conversation cause I realized my energy was draining. I instantly realized this new coworker, Evie, is like me, also an energy vampire. And she's a more advanced, emotional vampire. She feeds on people's sympathy by playing the victim. People she's drained are left with nothing. I think she invaded my territory. That's not really appropriate. So I decided to compete with Her. We both crazily went after everyone in the office. Didn't spare a single person. Even when people went to the bathroom, we'd follow them into Chat. Beth, I think my dog might be autistic, and I need a shoulder to cry on. Beth, please. Beth, what do you think of the new toilet paper in here? I was wondering. Let go! This is crazy. Oh, you don't use a toilet paper liner? Not a seat protector. Dude, I'm just so sad, and I don't know what to do. I'm not feeling well. I, I, I feel really weak. Under our assault, a lot of co workers passed out. I realized it was time to settle this. I was held up at gunpoint while waiting in line to see that movie. But they didn't take any money. They just did it for fun. Two hours later, we were both exhausted. Tired. Have you ever considered hunting with a partner? Thought has only recently crossed my mind. Then we decided to team up. I invited her to dinner, but what we were eating wasn't the food on the menu. It was the waiter next to us. We got married out of convenience. I have Munchausen's by proxy. I tell people he's sick so I feel better, but then I do get sick. And when I do get sick, people don't believe that I'm sick because they know she does Munchausen by proxy all the time. The waiter finally couldn't take it. Anymore? Asked if we were actually gonna order or not. We're feeding right now.

But after examining me for half an hour, the doctor told me I didn't need any treatment. He said it would get better if I just stayed away from my husband for a while. I tried to explain that I've been divorced for years and I hadn't dated anyone since then. But the doctor didn't believe me. He thought I was lying. No matter how much I tried to explain, the doctor stuck to his diagnosis. The next day, I came back.

After making some quick notes about my case, he just turned and walked away. But guess what? I was back again on the third day. This time my neck was hurting, and after checking me out, the doctor said it was a hickey. I told him I'd already looked it up online, and I was sure it was an early sign of cancer. The doctor was getting frustrated. He still thought I was making things up. I kept telling the doctor I didn't have a husband and I hadn't had a boyfriend in ages. Seeing how insistent I was. He pulled out a couple strands of my hair, planning to run some kind of psychological test to see if maybe I'd gotten a boyfriend without being aware of it. But I stood my ground. The doctor went ahead and tested my hair, but the results came back totally normal. He thought I might have split personality disorder, so he asked me how I've been sleeping. I told him I slept just fine, except I always woke up feeling exhausted and worn out. And my ex husband, who lives downstairs, he'd been calling me lately, wanting to get back together after hearing all this. But the doctor seemed to have figured something out. He had me spend the night in the hospital sleep lab the next day looking at my brain waves. He noticed they became extremely active after midnight. That's a classic sign of sleepwalking. The truth finally came out. Turns out I've been sleepwalking to my ex husband's place every night, which explained the pregnancy and the hickey. The doctor suggested I just go home and remarry the guy, joking that I couldn't even keep my ex out of my dreams. Then he prescribed me some medication to help treat my sleepwalking problem.

Looking down into the pitch black depths below, I was too scared to move a muscle. Even worse, my left leg was completely numb and both hands were bleeding non stop. After calming down briefly, I checked out my surroundings. Below was an endless abyss. All around me were smooth, curved walls and the top was incredibly far away. I felt completely hopeless.

I realized I couldn't just sit there waiting to die. I had to find a way out. I pressed my left hand against the stone wall and tried using my right foot, which still had feeling. But then something unexpected happened that scared me into a cold.

My purpose was to scrape off the peach fuzz, then carefully hide it inside a pin cap. When I walked past the nanny, I flicked my finger gently and the peach fuzz fell onto her. Before long, the nanny developed severe allergic symptoms, her body trembling violently as she coughed. She quickly went to the hospital for an examination. I secretly took photos of the nanny, then deliberately showed them to the lady of the house, telling her that the nanny had contracted severe tuberculosis. But the lady didn't believe my one sided story. They were on their way home. My daughter received a message from me saying I'd be home in 3 minutes. She immediately took out a prepared peach and again scattered peach fuzz on the nanny. The lady of the house arrived home. She indeed witnessed the nanny's abnormal condition. But our conspiracy didn't end there. I then squeezed ketchup on the tissues the nanny had used, deliberately picking them up for the lady to see us. The innocent nanny was fired by the lady of the house. The next day, I recommended a new nanny to the lady. Unbeknownst to her, the new nanny was my wife. Soon our entire family became.

A strange bird was sitting right on top of me. The giant bird opened its huge beak and its saliva dripped onto my face, nipped my head with its beak, and I frowned in fear as I turned my head away. Then I saw that this monstrous bird had hurt the neighbour's dog and brought it to my bedside. I couldn't hold it in anymore. I gagged and threw up everything I'd eaten that evening. The bird looked at my expression, almost like it realised it had done something wrong. The next morning, I hurried to bury the neighbour's dog, but my little brother from upstairs saw everything. Later, while I was hiding under the bed and hugging the bird, my dad and brother came into my room. My dad was confused about why I was lying under the bed, but then he noticed some scratch marks on my bed. He 2 and two together right away and left the room with my brother. To make sure the bird got fat, I went to the pet store to buy some bird food. That evening, I hid the bird in my wardrobe and tried to feed it, but it didn't know how. So I started mimicking how to eat the bird food myself. And sure enough, the bird copied me and began eating. Once it was full, it touched me. With its cold claws, like it was feeling cold, I decided to dress the bird in my extra clothes. I even put a hair accessory on its head and held up a mirror so it could see its reflection.

Normal Tuesday afternoon. We were stopped at a red light on Sherman Boulevard when this SUV just slammed into us from behind. Not like a little tap either. Full on crash. The whole car lurched forward and my coffee went flying. Mia started screaming immediately, like that high pitched baby scream that makes your heart drop into your stomach. I whipped around to check on her and she was just wailing in her car seat, face all red. Jessica immediately unbuckled her seatbelt and reached back trying to get Mia out of the car seat. I grabbed her arm hard. Don't touch her car seat. Jessica looked at me like I'd lost my mind. She's crying. We need to get her out. No, leave her in the seat until the paramedics check her. Guy who hit us was already out of his car apologizing through my window. I could smell something burning from his engine. Jessica kept reaching for Mia and I literally had to block her with my arm. Jessica, stop. I'm serious. Just going to let her cry like that. I was trying to reach back and stroke Mia's leg, making shushing sounds, but yeah, she was still screaming it Was killing me. Every instinct in my body wanted to scoop her up and hold her. But I'd read about this exact situation in one of those mom groups. If there's any chance of spinal injury, you keep them in the car seat because it keeps everything aligned. The fire truck showed up first, then an ambulance. Paramedic came to my window and I explained there was a baby in the back. He immediately told Jessica to step away from the car seat, which made her huff and cross her arms. They got this neck brace thing and checked Mia while she was still strapped in. The whole time, Jessica was muttering stuff under her breath. They took all three of us to County Hospital just to be safe. Jessica and I got cleared pretty quick, just some bruising from the seatbelts. But they wanted to do a full check on Mia because she's so little. We were sitting in this pediatric exam room waiting for the doctor to come back with results. That's when Jessica started. I can't believe you just left her screaming like that in the car.

I'm 29, oldest of four kids. We do Sunday dinners every week, have for years. My sister's 27, my brother's 25, and the youngest is 22. We're supposed to be close. Three weeks ago, my brother's girlfriend posted an Instagram story at midnight, my whole family at this fancy Italian place downtown, the one we only go to for birthdays, everyone dressed up, laughing, wine glasses raised in a toast. I wasn't there, didn't even know about it. I stared at that photo for 20 minutes trying to convince myself it was old. I called my mom the next day, hey, casual, like I wasn't freaking out. Hey, saw you guys went to Giovanni's. How was it? She got this weird guilty tone, oh, it was last minute. We thought you were busy with work. My work schedules in our family group chat, they knew I was free. Then it kept happening. Brunch at the new spot on 5th, game night at my sister's, a weekend at the Lakehouse. Every time I found out through social media or group chat references I didn't understand, they'd talk about things and I'd ask what they meant you had to be there. They'd say the group chat had become two conversations, the one I could see and the one I couldn't. Last Sunday, I showed up early, got there at 5:50 instead of six. Door was unlocked. So I walked in, they were already eating, all of them. Plates full, wine poured mid conversation. In 29 years, we've never started without everyone there. The room went silent. My youngest sister wouldn't look at me. My brother stared at his phone. Mom started talking too fast about nothing, work and weather. Barely breathing between words, I sat down in my spot. Nobody passed me anything. I had to make my own plate while everyone watched. When I came back, dad said we're just tired. Long week. That's when I saw the new photo on the mantle. All of them dressed fancy outside some venue with string lights. Wedding recent. Based on my sister's new haircut. I grabbed the frame. Whose wedding is this? Dead silence. Everyone doing that thing where they're having a conversation with just their eyes. Mom finally spoke. Your cousin Peyton's, you weren't in?

Fresh nails, new highlights. Your mother would have loved this scarf. Yeah, it too bad she never got to see it. My mom was dead. And that's what she said. I logged into our shared cloud account. Location history showed regular visits to an address in the wealthy part of town. Text messages with Jess. Yoga class. Sarah hadn't been to yoga in three years. Photos with some guy with slicked back hair and a Rolex. And restaurants I could never afford. All while my mother was dying. That night, while she was out, moved with purpose. Transferred all but $500 from our joint accounts. $8,500 checking, $42,000 savings into a new account in my name. Thank god I never added her to my condo deed. Called a divorce attorney requesting an urgent appointment. Two weeks later, she sat me down. We need to talk. I think we should get a divorce. Her voice was calm, rehearsed. He mentioned sacrifices, how she deserved more. Then a friend has been helping me see things more clearly. I filed Monday. Her papers demanded everything. Half the house, savings, assets. Plus spousal support. Despite her high salary. I hired a P I. The report revealed her lover wasn't the wealthy businessman he pretended. Fake Rolex, short term rental, paid with Maxed credit cards. One man operation with a fancy website. They were both playing roles. Neither had money. Then he contacted me. I'm willing to testify about everything he said. The lies. How she bragged about muting your calls while your mom was dying. She stole from me, too. Court day arrived. Sarah showed up looking like the wronged wife. Modest dress, minimal makeup, carrying a Bible. Her lawyer presented first. Sacrifices for my career. How I'd cut her off without warning. Then my attorney was methodical. Financial records showing her spending spree during mom's illness. Police reports documenting property damage. She trashed the condo. Photos of destroyed keepsakes, including my mother's jewelry. Then our surprise witness walked in. The color drained from her face. He detailed their year long affair. Confirmed she deliberately muted my calls, laughing about it while I arranged my mother's funeral. Described how she planned to divorce me and take everything once she'd secured her upgrade. The judge was unmoved by her tears. His ruling. Condo remained entirely mine. Assets divided with consideration for her misconduct. Spousal support denied. She was ordered to pay for property damage. Total victory.

She said Henry had stepped up to be the father. I refused to be. Her voice cracked when she said my son had started calling Henry Dad. The courtroom was silent. Even I almost believed I was the villain in this story. The judge asked about child support payments. Emelia's lawyer smiled and started to say I was behind, but I interrupted. I asked the judge if I could approach with my documentation. He looked surprised but allowed it. I pulled out my folder and showed him the bank statements. Court ordered amount was $850 per month. Every statement showed I've been paying $2,400, triple the requirement. The judge's eyebrows went up. Then I showed him everything else. Private school tuition, $18,000 per year. Sports fees and equipment, $6,000 annually. Medical insurance through my warehouse job, $450 per month, all paid by me, all documented. Amelia's face went pale. Her lawyer had gone completely quiet. Then I showed him the mortgage payments. House, the one with the renovated kitchen, $2,100 per month. For 18 months I've been paying it because she called crying that the bank was going to foreclose. That was $37,800. I had every transfer receipt, every text where she thanked me and promised to pay me back. The judge asked Amelia if this was true. She couldn't speak at first, then finally admitted, yes, I've been helping with expense. The judge cut her off and asked where All her money had gone if I was paying for everything. He looked at Henry and his designer suit, then at the Hawaii vacation photos. Amelia just cried. The judge asked me directly why I'd missed my custody weekends. I told him I worked three jobs to pay for it all. The only way to afford everything was double shifts on weekends. I miss my kids every day, but I couldn't let them lose their school, their home, their life. The judge reviewed my documents one more time, then made his ruling. Primary custody awarded to me effective immediately. Child support reduced to the state minimum, $400 per month to be paid by Amelia. And she was ordered to repay me $37,800 for the mortgage payments with interest. Her lawyer tried to object, but the judge said any mother who would drag a father to court while he financially supported her lifestyle wasn't acting in the children's best interest. Amelia was sobbing. Henry looked like he might throw up. I walked out of that courthouse with full custody. Turns out when you're not paying someone else's mortgage and triple child support, you can actually afford to be a parent.

She left with another man because he's rich. He threw a dollar Bill on me and said I will take good care of her tonight. Next day, my cheating wife found out her key no longer fit the door and her affair partner called her screaming, you didn't tell me your husband is. I'm Jake, 44, and I build custom BBQ smokers in Georgia, not the cheap stuff from big box stores. I'm talking 4,000 to 8,000 dollar masterpieces that serious pitmasters dream about. My hands are always dirty. My back hurts most days. But I own my business and paid off my mortgage early. My wife, Sophia, worked in marketing at some fancy tech company. She's gorgeous, ambitious, and honestly, I thought we were solid. We have four kids, Emma, 17, the twins, Ryan and Rachel, 14, and little Mia, 11. Life was good, or so I thought. For five years, Sophia stopped inviting me to her work parties, said I didn't fit the culture, that my blue collar jokes made her colleagues uncomfortable. I figured it was normal. We were just different. I built things with my hands. She built power points. And last month she suddenly needed me at her company party. Not wanted, needed. That was weird. But I went. The party was at some country club. Everyone was in suits talking about synergy and optimization. I wore my cleanest jeans and a button up. Sophia looked nervous. The Whole time, which should have been my first clue. Then I met Brendan Cole. He was Sophia's new boss. Early 30s, designer suit, Rolex Range Rover. The guy who thinks money makes you interesting. He touching Sophia's arm while talking. Too comfortable, too familiar. Around ten PM, Brendan approached me with this smirk. Jake, right? The BBQ guy. He said it like I sold hot dogs at gas stations. Listen, Sophia's been working really hard. I'm taking her to a late meeting to discuss her promotion. Very important.

That night, I called Jenna and she didn't even deny it. I'm just worried about her, she said. You're so stressed all the time. You're alone and I have stability. I told her that if she ever came near my house again, I'd call the police. She laughed. You'll regret saying that. They're going to take her eventually. Better with me than with strangers. After that, I started documenting everything, not for court, but for my own sanity. I kept a journal of every feeding, every doctor visit, every clean Bill of health. I made sure the house looked spotless even at midnight, because I never knew when a knock might come. The neighbors began to notice the visits, too. And one of them, a retired teacher named Missus Patell, started checking in when I worked late shifts. Someone's trying to break you, she said one evening while helping me rock Mirra to sleep. Don't let them win. I tried not to, but the worst part wasn't the investigations. It was the way Jenna started showing up at family gatherings with this righteous smile, talking about how some people just aren't cut out for motherhood. My mother would tell her to stop, but she never did. One weekend at my cousin's barbecue, I lost it. Jenna was holding Mira, cooing at her when I walked over and took her back. You need to stop pretending she's yours, I said, loud enough for everyone. To hear Jenna's eyes widened, then narrowed. I'm just trying to protect her, she said. From what? From her own mother, I snapped. I was done pretending we were still sisters. Jenna stormed off, shouting that I'd regret it. A week later, another CPS visit came, but this time the worker was different. She'd read through the old reports and seen the pattern. I think I know what's happening, she said quietly. False reports like these are considered harassment. She didn't promise anything, but her tone was different. That night, for the first time in months, I slept with Mira curled against me and didn't wake up at every sound. Jenna hasn't called since, but sometimes I still find myself waiting for that knock.

I just walked out to the living room and pretended to check my phone. Kyle followed me out there. Like two minutes later. He had this look on his face like I just insulted his whole bloodline. What the hell was that about? I tried to play it off. What was, what about you acting like there's something wrong with my daughter because she looked at you. I didn't say anything was wrong with her. You literally said it's genetic, like she's got some disease. That's not what I meant. She just has the same look as Jenny. And it caught me off guard. Kyle crossed his arms. So now you're saying my wife looks wrong, too, dude? No, I'm just saying your daughter has her mom's stare. That's it. He wasn't buying it. You didn't want to hold her after that. You basically ran away from a baby. Jenny walked in holding Avery at that point. He didn't say anything, but she gave me that look again. Now I had two of them staring at me. Kyle kept going, you've been weird about Jenny since we started dating. You think I don't notice? I'm not weird about her. She's just intense. She's quiet. That's not the same thing. I should have just apologized and left, but I was already in it. Kyle, she stares at people like she's planning something. Your daughter just did the same thing to me. It freaked me out for a second. Jenny finally spoke up. Her voice was super calm, which somehow made it worse. Maybe kids can tell when someone's uncomfortable around their parents. That shut me up real fast. Kyle pointed at the door. I think you should go. I grabbed my jacket and left. Didn't even finish the lunch they made. I texted Kyle later that night saying sorry, but he just left me on read. My mom called me the next day asking what happened because Kyle told her I insulted the baby. I tried explaining it was just a dumb comment, but she said I need to apologize in person. I haven't been back over there since.

That was 4 years ago. Not a cent repaid. I'm calling that debt forgiven and not in a good way. Friday, I got an email from Dad's boss. He'd seen the Facebook video before dad deleted it. Wanted to check if you're okay. Monday, Mark brought me an envelope found under his windshield. Inside were four pages and two photos. The first page wasn't an apology. We were never easy to understand. Second page got weirder. He mentioned a loan he took out in my name five years ago. Used my SSN. I ran to my uncle. We pulled my credit report. Two credit cards I didn't recognize. One had a $2,400 balance, missed payment from three years ago. He'd stolen my identity. My uncle made a call. We're reporting it today. That night, mom texted, there's something in your room. Mark checked, found a shoebox. Inside was a bankbook. Mom had opened an account in my name when I was 14, saved over $3,000. I'd never seen that money. Dad drained it two weeks after I turned 21. Tuesday morning, I sat across from an attorney. She flipped through everything. He's committed multiple federal crimes. If you want to press charges, we can start right now. I nodded. That afternoon, mom showed up, handed me a grocery bag, my high school journal inside. I grabbed what I could. He wanted to burn it. Why are you here? I'm leaving him. Then she. Told me something else. Dad had been borrowing money from relatives using my name, telling people I was sick. It wasn't just my uncle's $6,000. There was $4,000 from my cousin's father, another $3,500 from my great aunt on Social Security. She showed me screenshots all during the time I was working two jobs. That night, my cousin brought an envelope, $1,500 in cash. We've been setting this aside. It's yours. I stayed up organizing everything, screenshots, credit reports, photos of my destroyed room, every text. I put it all in a folder, wrote 5 words on the cover, you don't own me anymore. The next morning, I drove to my parents house, walked up to the porch and shoved the folder into the mailbox. Didn't knock, didn't wait, just turned around and left.

He's 63 years old. He should have thought about that before destroying my property. I went to the bank. Close the joint account my father had tricked me into opening. Cut every financial tie. Three days later, Linda called again. They're both facing jail time. Please drop the charges. No. What is wrong with you? You betrayed me first. I hung up, never answered another call. I sold the property and let them all out. Mark ended up in a rundown apartment, working for the first time in his life. My father got six months probation and a criminal record. Linda stopped speaking to both of them. Linda sent one last message. You've destroyed this family. I typed back. No, Linda. I just stopped letting you destroy me.

She left me for a fun guy who parties every night. But now she wants me back because he won't grow up or help with her kid. We've been married for four years with two kids, Emma, 8, and Jake, 6. I work in it security making six figures. Not exciting, but it pays well. Sarah was a stay at home mom who started hanging out with divorced women from her yoga class who acted like they were still 22. The complaint started small. We never do anything fun anymore. Then escalated to wanting me to hire babysitters so we could go clubbing on Tuesday nights with two kids at home and me up at 6:00am for work. You've turned into this boring old man, she'd say. I'm 35, not 65. I'm not ready to be dead yet. Her yoga friends introduced her to Tyler, 28 years old, bartender, drives a least BMW he can't afford, lives with three roommates. Erra started coming home talking about how Tyler did this or Tyler said that, how he was teaching them to live in the moment. The breaking point came the night before Thanksgiving. I was prepping food for the next day. My parents were coming over, her sister's family, too. Sarah walked in dressed for a nightclub. Where are you going out with the girls? Tyler knows the Owner of this new place. It's the night before Thanksgiving. We have family coming tomorrow. God, you're so boring now. You used to be fun. Now you're just this middle aged suburban dad who thinks watching Netflix is an adventure. I stood there processing. You're right. I am a middle aged Bourbon dad because I'm 35 with two kids in the suburbs. That's literally what I am. She rolled her eyes and left. Came back at 4 a. M. Slept through Thanksgiving morning, showed up looking like death while my mom made passive aggressive comments. Two weeks later, divorce papers. Already had them ready. Already talked to a lawyer, already told her yoga friends. Everyone knew except me. I didn't fight it. I got the kids during the week. She got weekends. She got the house. But I kept paying half the mortgage. Sarah moved Tyler in two weeks after I moved out the kid.

Apparently, you're the only one who qualified for your great aunt's life insurance payout, $2 million. But you have to sign within 72 hours or it defaults to the state. We've been calling for hours. This is about family. Where are you? $2 million. Great Aunt Dorothy, who'd raised me summers when mom was too overwhelmed, who'd held my hand through my first panic attack, who'd written me letters every week until cancer took her voice, then her life. I looked at my surgical consent forms, at the machine tracking my unstable vitals, at the empty chairs where family should be. The nurse came in for final prep. Need anything before tomorrow? Yeah, I said, powering off my phone. Can you Mark that? I want no visitors during recovery. Family drama. She nodded knowingly. Survived the surgery, barely three weeks in ICU, two months learning to walk again. The 72 hours passed while I was in a medical coma. Mom left 89 voicemails, each more desperate than furious, than threatening. When I finally checked my phone, Marcus had posted another TikTok, a funeral arrangement. Rip to the family member who chose spite over family. You're dead to us. 2.3 million views. I posted my only response, a single photo, me in a wheelchair holding Dorothy's final letter and a bank statement showing the insurance payout caption, some family you choose. Some choose You thank you, Aunt Dorothy, for choosing me when no one else would. PS, the insurance company found me just fine. My brother's video got deleted. Mine got 18 million views. I bought a house next to Dorothy's grave. Sometimes the best family is the one who shows up when you're dying, even if they're already dead. The rest, they're just people you share DNA with. The lakehouse they lost. It turns out I've been paying the property taxes without telling anyone. Karma doesn't need a TikTok. It just needs time.

I'm 28. My sister Amy, 25, has been the golden child our entire lives. When I was five, I got a store bought cake for my birthday. Amy at two got professional face painters, a bouncy castle and a petting zoo. At 10, I saved months of allowance for a bike. When Amy saw it, she threw a fit. My parents bought her an even nicer one that same day. In fourth grade, I landed the lead in the school play. I practiced for weeks. My parents showed up an hour late, missing my big scene. They were consoling Amy over a stomachache. She was fine. They just lost track of time. I joined the math club, got straight A's, won first place at a regional science fair, barely noticed when Amy got a B+ in her weakest subject. They threw a celebratory dinner and bought her a new phone. In high school, I kept a 4.0 G P a, edited the school newspaper, captain the debate team. Amy barely maintained a C the average. Junior year, I was chosen for a prestigious Harvard summer program. When I told them at dinner, my dad grunted and changed the subject to Amy's dance recital. The day I left for Harvard was the night of Amy's concert. My parents couldn't drive me to the airport. I asked a friend's parents for a ride. When I got into multiple elite colleges with a full scholarship, my dad said, don't let it go to your head. Just remember us when you're off becoming a big shot. When Amy barely passed high school and skipped college, they praised her for knowing herself. They bought her a car as a graduation gift. By 27, I had a finance job and bought my own house. My parents never said they were proud. Then my grandfather died. He left $500,000 to me, split equally among all grandchildren. It would pay off my loans. Let me invest. Let me start my own business. When the wheel was red, my parents went pale. Later, they pulled me aside. It's unfair you got an equal share. My mom said, Amy needs it more. I stayed calm. Grandpa made this decision. You have no say. They exploded, called me selfish, ungrateful. My dad listed every bare minimum thing they've done, buying school supplies.

I was making a vanilla latte when this woman started screaming at me from the other side of the counter. Her face was bright red like she'd been running. Your baby is being born across the street right now and this is what you're doing. I finished pouring the milk and looked up at her confused. Ma'am, I'm just doing my job. That's when things got crazy. She actually came around the counter, which customers are not allowed to do, and grabbed my arm hard enough to leave marks. Her nails dug into my skin through my work shirt. Let's go, she said, pulling me toward the door. You were absent during this whole pregnancy, but you're not gonna miss the birth of your daughter. I tried to pull away, but she had this death grip on me. My manager, Eddie just stood there with his mouth open, not helping at all. Lady, I don't have a wife and certainly not a pregnant one, I said, trying to make sense of what was happening. She snorted and dragged me harder. Yeah, cause you never cared to meet Lana or the rest of her friends and family, she spat back at me. My brain was spinning trying to think of any Lana I knew. I went through every girl I'd talked to in the past year. Nothing. No Lana's At work or gym or anywhere. I've never met a Lana before. She stopped at the cafe door and turned to glare at me. You better not say that in the delivery room. Before I could argue more, she yanked me across the street to the hospital. The emergency room was packed, but she marched right past everyone to the maternity ward like she owned the place. At the sign in desk, there was a young nurse with a butterfly tattoo on her wrist who looked up and immediately frowned at me. So this is the guy, the nurse asked a crazy woman. Yep, this is him, the woman said. Can you believe how irresponsible and toxic he is? He doesn't even remember her name. The nurse shook her head at me like I was the worst person alive. Room 3, 67, they're all waiting for you. I wanted to run, but the woman still had my arm in her iron grip. She pushed me into the elevator and press the button for the third floor. When the doors opened, there was an older couple standing in the hallway. The man was tall and bald with arms like tree trunks. The woman was shorter with.

Month three, Tyler maxed out her credit card buying DJ equipment for his music career. She called asking if I could cover her mortgage. That sounds like a Tyler problem, I said, and hung up. Month 4 Tyler crashed her car while texting. Not on her insurance. She called about the deductible. Ask Tyler. Month 5 Tyler's ex girlfriend showed up screaming about stolen rent money. Emma called me crying about scary people yelling. I filed an emergency custody petition the next morning.

But that wasn't the worst part. Tyler had been stealing from her cash, jewelry, credit cards in her name. The house was in foreclosure because Tyler convinced her to skip payments for a Cabo vacation where he Hooked up with two different women. I need help, she sobbed. You should talk to your lawyer. The one you hired to divorce me. Tyler disappeared. Blocked her. Moved in with the hostess. Sarah moved back with her parents at 35. A year later, she lost the house to foreclosure.

But grandma left the house to me in her will, so I packed their bags and put them out the door. I remember the exact moment I realised I no longer mattered in my own family. I was washing dishes when Richard, my stepdad, and to Lucas and said, have you thought about where you want to go for college? Lucas grinned, still deciding N, y, U, or maybe Stanford. But, you know, it's all about the funding. My mother's face lit up. Oh, sweetheart, we'll make sure you go wherever you want. My stomach dropped. Richard cleared his throat. Actually, Rebecca and I were just talking about that. My mother turned to me, her expression unreadable. Evan, we need to talk about your college fund. My father's college fund, the one he set aside before he passed away. The only thing he left that was truly mine. What about it? My fingers tightened around the towel. Well, it's just sitting there, Richard said, and Lucas has such a bright future, we thought it would make sense to put it to good use. I laughed. Dry, hollow laugh. You're joking, Evan. Don't be dramatic, my mother said, folding her arms. You're already in college. Lucas needs this more than you do. It's mine. Dad left that money for me. Richard took a slow sip of whiskey. Look, son, I'm not your son. And you have no right to touch my father's money, my mother's side. Evan, you don't need to make this harder than it has to be. That's when I knew this wasn't just Richard's idea. This was hers. You're not taking my money, I said. Voice cold and steady. Richard scoffed. What are you going to do about it? I looked at my mother, searching for any hint of remorse. Nothing. Take it, I said quietly, but don't expect to see me again. I walked out that night, crashed at my best friend's place for a week. Then my grandmother died. I found out through a text. The cold statement, your grandmother passed. Funeral is Saturday. No. Are you okay? No. I know you were close. Nothing at the funeral. I kept my distance. And then I heard my mother talking to Richard. The house is too big to sit empty. We should move in. She.

I went to a coffee shop and sat there kind of in shock. Then I remembered something. Two months ago, our lawyers made me sign a bunch of paperwork for the investor deal. I'd kept a copy. So I pulled it up on my laptop and started reading. There it was. Clause 4.2 b, contingent employment, named officers. My name in the contract, entire 50 million dollar investment was conditional on my continued employment. If I left or got fired, the whole deal could collapse. Marcus had literally just torpedoed a 50 million dollar investment. On a live call with the people writing the check, I didn't do anything, just sat there drinking bad coffee. But my phone started blowing up text from co workers, old colleagues, even a board member. Apparently about 90 seconds after I left, one of the Cascade partners unmuted. I'm sorry. Our term sheet specifically requires Miss Chen's continued employment. That's clause 4.2 b, page 3. The entire investment is structured around her technical leadership. Who are you and what authority did you have to terminate her? Dead silence. And another investor joined. We're going to need to pause this call and reconvene with your legal team and board chair. This is highly irregular. The demo call ended within an hour. There was an emergency board meeting. By that evening. My lawyer, yeah, I called one immediately got a call from the board chair. They wanted me back. Not just back. They wanted to make me interim CEO while they restructured. Marcus escorted out by security the next morning. Turns out when you tank a 50 million dollar deal because you wanted to feel important, boards don't really forgive that. The best part, I went back to the office yesterday to clean out my desk, except I didn't go to my old desk. I went upstairs to the executive floor where my new office is. The board handed me a new key card, new contract and basically everything Marcus thought he was getting when he fired me, all because he never bothered to read page three.

I decided to investigate myself. I drove to Sienna's neighborhood and knocked on doors. The neighbor two doors down, a sweet lady in her 80s, had a ring camera. I asked her for the footage, and she happily obliged. The camera showed Rider's car dropping Sienna off at 7:35. I watched anxiously as Sienna got out of the car and walked away from her house. Rider drove off in the opposite direction. Direction? Then at 9:45, a different car pulled up. Sienna got out of this car, stumbling. She was heavily bruised and beaten, now falling to the ground and crawling to her door. I zoomed in on the footage, but couldn't make anything out. Was this someone else? Or had Ryder used someone else's car to make himself look innocent? I brought the footage to the police station. Either way, the detective watched the footage twice and called Sienna and her father in for a second interview. I sat behind the glass, watching. The detective showed Sienna the footage. We have video of you arriving home at 9:45 from a different vehicle. You Looked injured in this footage. Who drove you home at 9:45? Sienna started shaking. She wouldn't answer. All of a sudden, she lunged into her dad's arms and started sobbing so hard she couldn't breathe. Her dad put his arm around her. Sienna, it's okay, baby. Daddy's got you. He embraced her for a minute, and everyone stopped asking questions, giving her the minute she very clearly needed. Finally, she pulled away, and her dad wiped her tears with a tissue. Sienna, who did this to you? Who did it, baby? She looked around, and finally she said it. Someone named Dante. My stomach dropped. Dante was my other son. He was 22. He had serious anger issues and had just left for a work trip a few days ago. I. I've been seeing Dante for two months. Behind Rider's back. Sienna cried that night. After rider dropped me off, I went to meet Dante. We got into an argument, and he beat me. Then he threatened me. He said if I told anyone it was him, he'd come back and finish it. He said blame rider or he'd make it worse. I was so scared. Sienna's dad went pale. My god. I almost destroyed an innocent kid. The detective looked at me. Where is Dante now?

Three years of late nights, debugging sessions, and honestly some of my best work ever. Then 6 months ago, they hired Marcus as VP of strategy. Classic corporate guy, all buzzwords, no actual skills.

Fast forward to last Tuesday, we had our biggest investor demo ever, $50 million on the line with Cascade Capital, 38 investors watching, including their managing partners. I've been prepping for weeks. The demo was going perfect, like genuinely flawless, real time metrics, live performance benchmarks, everything clicking. I had maybe 3 minutes left when Marcus suddenly took over my presentation, just hijacked the whole thing to ramble about synergies and paradigm shifts. Pure nonsense. I stayed calm, let him finish, then I took back control and closed strong. Even got a thumbs up emoji from one of the investors. But here's where it gets crazy. As I'm setting up for Q&A, Marcus steps in front of the camera. And says loud and clear, Sarah, you're, you're fired. Leave now. I literally froze. The whole call went silent like you could hear a pin drop across the internet. I didn't argue, didn't ask why. I just set down the clicker, walked off camera, grabbed my coat and left the building. Within 60 seconds, my slack was.

We've already paid the clinic and signed all the contracts on your behalf, she said, sliding the papers across the coffee table. I snatched them up and saw my signature on every single page.

Dad pulled out his phone and showed me the bank transfers. $25,000 to the fertility clinic. We already paid everything up front, and it's non refundable. He said if you don't show up tomorrow, we lose all of the money. My sister started crying those fake tears she perfected since childhood. I can't have kids naturally, and you're my only sister, my only hope. How can you be so selfish? Her husband put his arm around her and glared at me like I was the villain in the situation. My brother showed me text from our extended family, aunts and uncles and cousins all congratulating me on my sacrifice. Grandma had apparently donated $5,000.

I don't know. Maybe she's scared and confused. Maybe someone's threatening. I'll believe you. I cut him off, but if you're lying to me, dad, I love her. He interrupted. I would never hit her. You know me. Ryder's behavior had changed. Now he wasn't defensive anymore, rather genuinely desperate to prove his innocence. And as a father, I couldn't not trust my son. I decided to investigate myself. I drove to Sienna's neighborhood and knocked on doors. The neighbor two doors down, a sweet lady in her 80s, had a ring camera. I asked her for the footage and she happily obliged. The camera showed Rider's car dropping Sienna off at 7:35. I watched anxiously as Sienna got out of the car and walked away from her house. Rider drove off in the opposite direction. Then at 9:45, a different car pulled up. Sienna got out of this car, stumbling. She was heavily bruised and beaten, now falling to the ground and crawling to her door. I zoomed in on the footage but couldn't make anything out. Was this someone else or had Ryder used someone else's car to make himself look innocent? I brought the footage to the police station. Either way, the detective watched the footage twice and called Sienna and her father in for a second interview. I sat behind the glass watching. The detective showed Sienna the footage. We have video of you arriving home at 9:45 from a different vehicle. You looked injured. In this footage. Drove you home at 9:45. Sienna started shaking. She wouldn't answer. All of a sudden, she lunged into her dad's arms and started sobbing so hard she couldn't breathe. Her dad put his arm around her. Sienna, it's okay, baby. Daddy's got you. He embraced her for a minute and everyone stopped asking questions, giving her the minute she very clearly needed. Finally, she pulled away and her dad wipe her tears with a tissue. Sienna, who did this to you? Who did it, baby? He looked around and finally she said it. Someone named Dante. My stomach dropped. Dante was my other son. He was 22. He had serious anger issues and had just left for a work trip a few days ago. I've been seeing Dante for two months. Find Ryder's back. Sienna cried. That night after Ryder dropped me off, I went to meet Dante. We got into an argument and he beat me. Then he threatened me. He said if I told anyone it was him, he'd come back and finish it. He said Blame Ryder or he'd make it worse. I was so scared. Sienna's dad went pale. My god, I almost destroyed an innocent kid. The detective looked at me. Where is Dante now?

I didn't argue, just paid the Bill and left the table. When her friends saw who picked me up outside, she froze. This happened last month, and I'm still processing it. My wife Jessica and I had been married for seven years. I'm a middle school teacher, 34, and she's a marketing director, 32. We have two kids. I've always been the safe guy, the one who coaches Little League, makes breakfast on weekends, and never complains. That night, we were at this fancy Italian place downtown with her work friends. I'd come straight from baseball practice with our son, still wearing my dusty sneakers. The moment I sat down, I could feel the energy shift. These weren't my people. They were the type who judge you by your watch and your job title. About 20 minutes in, Jessica was on her third glass of wine. She was laughing louder than usual, trying to impress them. Then she said it. I mean, Ryan's amazing with the kids, she told the table, gesturing at me like I wasn't sitting right there. But let's be real, he's not exactly a real man, you know? The table erupted in laughter. Not awkward laughter. Real cruel laughter. I didn't say a word. I just pulled out my wallet, dropped my credit card on the check, and stood up. Babe, don't be dramatic. She. She said, rolling her eyes, I'm Just joking. I signed the receipt, pushed in my chair and walked out. The night air hit me as I stood on the curb. Three seconds later, a black Mercedes SUV pulled up. Tinted windows, professional detail. The kind of car that makes people look twice. The passenger door opened. A woman stepped out, maybe late forties. Sharp gray suit, no nonsense expression. She carried a leather briefcase and wore a watch that probably cost more than my car. Behind me, I heard the restaurant door open. Ryan, who was that? Jessica's voice was shaky now. I didn't turn around. I just slid into

I waited until everyone was uncomfortable before I turned to my brother and said, I've been thinking about those smoothies you make, dad, every morning, and I finally figured out what is making him so sick. My brother started to say something, but I cut him off and told my dad that his devoted son has been making those health smoothies with tap water this entire time. Not filtered water, just straight from the faucet for months. My dad's face went red and he slammed both hands down on the table, dreaming about how he had told everyone a thousand times that he could only drink filtered water, that we'd never actually talked about this at all. He turned to my brother and screamed, you've been poisoning me with tap water for months! You're killing me with your stupidity! My mom jumped in to defend my brother and said it was an honest mistake, which only made my dad turn on her and yell about how she should have been supervising. My brother said he had been making those smoothies every morning, and nobody said anything about water, but my dad screamed that he should not have to remind people of basic medical instructions. Brother stormed out and slammed the door so hard a picture frame fell off the wall. My mom was crying and saying, this Was my fault. While my dad yelled that nobody respected him, and I just sat there watching them all fall apart. My mom turned to me and called me an evil little troll who was as useless as my broken organs. But I said, at least my brain works, unlike either of yours. My dad went silent. I stood up and told them, I don't need your stupid inheritance anyway. My dad's face turned purple, and he started screaming about how I had no right to come into his house and destroy his family, about how ungrateful I was after everything they did for me, how the inheritance was his to do with as he pleased. Then he yelled, you think I wanted to give it all to your brother? I don't even have a choice anymore. I had to put the house up as collateral, and if I don't figure out how to pay back what I owe by next month, we lose everything anyway. My mom's face went completely white, and she said, what are you talking about? My dad realized what he had just said. He tried to backtrack, but my mom kept asking what he meant by collateral and what he owed. And finally he admitted he had been betting on sports online for years. The mortgage, the savings, the life insurance, all of it gone. My brother came back inside because he could hear the screaming, and my mom was crying about how there was Nothing left. And I just started laughing. My dad told me to get out, and I left, still laughing

I stared behind him to see her sitting in the passenger seat of their car, split lip, bloody nose, badly bruised cheek, holding an ice pack over one eye. I looked back at her dad who looked ready to kill. That's not possible, I stammered out. He loves, she told me everything. He cut me off. Police are coming in the morning. He slammed the door and walked away. I immediately ran upstairs to check on Ryder. He was asleep, but I turned on the light anyway. He woke up confused, used. That's when I saw the fresh scratches on his neck and forearm. What happened with Sienna tonight, I asked. He shot up instantly, rubbing his eyes. Um, nothing. We had a fight. I dropped her home. That's it. What kind of fight? I pressed him. He started stammering. She was accusing me of stuff. I don't want to talk about it right now. His voice was defensive. I know. His knuckles red and bruised. The police showed up at 9:00am the next morning. A detective knocked on the door with two officers behind him. We have a warrant for Rider's arrest. Rider came downstairs in his pajamas. He saw the police and went pale. Dad, what's happening? The detective read him his rights. The victim identified you. Neighbors heard screaming from your car around 7 last night. Dad, I Swear I didn't. Rider was panicking. The officer cuffed his hands behind his back. I watched them walk my son to the police car. I stood in my doorway thinking about the scratches, the bruises on his knuckles, the fight he wouldn't elaborate on. I visited Ryder in jail that afternoon. He was sitting on a metal bench looking terrified. Dad, you have to believe me. I didn't hit her. Then explain why she looks beat up. Explain the scratches and bruises on your knuckles. He leaned forward. We fought in the car. She was yelling. I was yelling back. She hit me and I grabbed her wrist to stop her. That's where the scratches came from. I where I dropped her home at 7:30 and left. I wanted to believe him, but Sienna's dad was already filing charges. He hired a lawyer. I talked to our lawyer the next day. She told me Sienna's testimony was bad. Sienna said Ryder drove her somewhere isolated, beat her within an inch of her life, then dumped her near her house around 10 at night. The neighbor already confirmed hearing them argue at 7. What about the bruises on his knuckles? I asked. The lawyer looked at her notes. Rider claims he punched his steering wheel after dropping her off because he was so angry. Everything he said sounded like an excuse. I went back to see rider. He was desperate. Now, dad, I'll take a lie detector test. Please check my Phone my car. I didn't do it. Then why is she saying this rider broke?

You don't mind, right, Moira? All the guests stared at her. Moira started crying, real tears streaming down her face. She's ruining everything! Make her stop! This is what we always do, I said, staying perfectly calm. I don't understand why you're upset. Dad's face turned red. You're going too far. This is cruel. Too far? I looked at him. This is exactly what happens at every birthday of mine. The only difference is I'm not allowed to cry about it. Mom's voice cracked, horrified by the sudden public exposure. You're older. You should know better. So when I was 5 and she was 3, I should have known better? You're ruining her special moment, dad said, grabbing the AirPods out of my hands. Her special moment? I burst out into laughter, pointing to the cake. This is my birthday. Moira's is quite literally four months away. Funny how all this sharing stuff only applies when it's my birthday. I mean, go ahead. Name one time Moira had to share her party. Nothing. Complete silence. Yeah, that's what I thought. Last year, her Sweet 16 had a professional photographer. The year before, you rented the country club. Before that, the pool party with a DJ. When has she ever had to share? I grabbed a cake cutter and started slicing up pieces and placing them on paper plates to hand out to guests. It's not fair! Moira screamed. It's not fair! It's not fair! I shrugged. At her little tantrum, I mean. You're absolutely right, Moira. It's not fair. It never was. Grandma stood up from her chair. I think we've seen enough. In fact, for 18 years, we've seen too much disparity and treatment, and it's sickening, my auntie agreed. You're the parents. You're not supposed to play favorites. This is a family matter, dad interrupted. We are family, and we're done watching this happen every year, my uncle said, before turning to me with a soft miles, we should have done this before. I'm so sorry, dear. They gave me a tight hug, the warmest hug I've had in years. Moira freaked out seeing everyone suddenly turning against her, and ran out of the room sobbing. Mom and dad quickly followed after her. Well, now, I know you've already cut the cake, but you at least deserve one moment, my auntie said, placing one lit candle onto a small slice. And for the first time in my life, people sang Happy Birthday just for me. I moved in with my grandparents that night. The video my friends took of Moira's tantrum spread through the school the following week. Moira had a breakdown when none of our relatives showed up to her birthday party months later. But I made sure to send her a gift of my own. A birthday cake with my name written neatly in cursive and hers awkwardly misspelled

I walked into the courtroom and saw my ex wife, Amelia, sitting with her lawyer, a stack of papers between them that looked three inches thick. Her new husband, Henry, sat behind her in a designer suit, arm draped over the back of her chair. The judge called the case and Amelia's lawyer stood up immediately laying out the accusations like he'd rehearse them 100 times. I was an absent father. I never showed up for my custody weekends. I missed soccer games, parent teacher conferences, birthday parties, school plays. I clearly didn't care about my kids. The lawyer slid a document across to the judge, a detailed log of every missed visitation over the past 18 months, 23 weekends, 41 scheduled events, all documented, all time stamped all missed. Judge looked at me over his glasses and asked me directly why I'd missed so many court ordered visitation with my children. Amelia was crying quietly, dabbing her eyes with a tissue. Henry squeezed her shoulder. I sat there in my wrinkled shirt that I'd worn to my second job that morning and I didn't have a good answer ready. What the judge couldn't see from those documents was the full picture. For the past 18 months, I've been working three jobs, morning shift at the warehouse, afternoon shift doing construction, night shift stocking shelves at a grocery store. I slept four hours a Night, if I was lucky, usually in my car between shifts. My custody weekends were Saturdays and Sundays, the only days I could pick up double shifts and overtime pay. Every time I missed a weekend, I texted Amelia explaining I was working. She always responded the same way, excuses. Meanwhile, her social media told a different story. New SUV in the driveway. Kitchen renovation with marble countertops. Family vacation to Hawaii with Henry and my kids. Caption reading, blessed life. My daughter wore dresses that cost more than I made in a week. In every post, Amelia's friends praised her for being such a strong single mom. And I kept getting thinner. I'd lost 30 pounds. My clothes didn't fit anymore. I had bruises under my eyes that never went away. My coworkers started asking if I was sick. But every two weeks I made my payments, every single one on time. Documented, Amelia's lawyer showed the judge printed Facebook posts, text messages where I canceled last minute school records showing I'd never attended a single event. Then Amelia took the stand. She talked about how she had to explain to the kids why daddy never showed up.

It means she owns it legally. Completely dead silence. Mark's face turned red. You knew about this clause? It's my contract, I said. Of course I knew. Then the third person in the room stood up.

No. You called her in here, threatened her, tried to steal something she built on her own time because you never listen to her in the first place. He turned to me. Emma, we're done here. Mark's mouth fell open. Wait, what? You had six years. You don't get another minute. Then he walked out. The board members followed. The lawyer packed up and left without a word. Mark just stood there, frozen. Holding my offer letter. I grabbed my bag and walked to the door. As I reached for the handle, my phone buzzed. Subject seed round discussion. Phoenix venture capital firm offering to talk funding. I looked back at Mark. He was still standing there, red faced and silent. You know what's sad? You could have been part of this. All you had to do was treat me like I mattered. Then I walked out. That was yesterday. This morning I woke up to three more VC emails and a term sheet offer. Mark texted me at eleven PM. Can we talk? I blocked his number. I'm done being someone's champ. I'm about to be someone's CEO.

I smiled, shook his hand and walked out. Monday morning his phone started ringing and by noon he was fired. You were average at best, easy to replace. My boss Martin said it during his speech at my retirement party. 32 years with the company, three decades of 60 hour weeks, birthdays, delayed vacations, and Martin stood at the podium telling 100 people I was replaceable. He didn't say it with malice. That was the worst part. He believed it. Frank's been a steady presence here, reliable, does what's asked. But let's be honest, in this business, nobody's irreplaceable. People chuckled nervously. My wife gripped my hand under the table. I just smiled, stood when it was over, shook Martin's hand. Thank you for the opportunity. Then I walked out. My colleagues looked confused. No speech, no goodbye. I said everything I needed to. Over the weekend, my phone stayed off. My wife asked if I was okay. I'm perfect, I told her. Monday morning, I was on my boat, first time in 15 years. I wasn't at my desk. By 6:00am, my phone started buzzing. Around 9. I ignored it. By 10, my wife checked, 30 missed calls, all from work. She showed me. Should you call back? No, I said. They'll figure it out. Tuesday, my former assistant, Sarah showed up at my house. Frank, please, you have to come back. Martin's losing. His mind. I poured coffee. What's happening? The Riverside project, the one you managed, the client called yesterday, said the new manager doesn't understand the scope. They're threatening to pull $8 million unless you come back. I sipped my coffee. That's unfortunate. There's more. The Henderson account, the system integration you built it trashed. Nobody knows how to fix it. You never documented it. I documented everything. I said calmly. I sent Martin a 200 page manual three years ago. He called it bureaucratic overkill, told me to focus on doing, not writing. Sarah's face fell. He never kept it. That's not my problem anymore, Frank. Please. Six projects are in jeopardy. The whole department's in chaos. And told everyone you were just a cog, that anyone could do your job. Turns out nobody can. I stood Sarah. I worked 32 years, missed my daughter's recitals, my son's games, holidays, anniversaries. I gave everything to that company. And Martin told a room full of people I was average, that I was easy to replace. So let him replace me. She left in tears. Wednesday, the CEO called. Frank, we need to talk. No, we don't. We'll pay you consulting rates, triple your salary. I'm retired. This is about your legacy. 32 years of work. My legacy. I laughed. Martin made my legacy clear. I was average, replaceable. So replace me, Frank. Martin made a mistake. Then fire him. Silence. We can't just, you can. He's a bad.

You know how I feel about him. She finally looked at me and her expression was cold. So you never actually dated him? It's not like you have dibs. She stepped closer. Besides, I like him, too. And unlike you, I can actually get him without patting. I couldn't believe it. The bullying started immediately. Boys would throw balled up tissues at my chest in class. Need more stuffing, they'd ask. Girls would corner me in the bathroom, demanding I prove I was real. Teachers saw it happening but did nothing because it was just kids being kids. One boy tried to grab my chest to check for tissues until I slapped him. Ranai watched it all while holding Oscar's hand in the hallway. She'd post Bible verses about kindness on Sunday, then laugh when someone threw tissues at me on Monday. Three weeks of living hell while she lived her perfect double life. Now it's Wednesday, Bible study night. Ranai just texted her parents that we're studying together, then headed to Oscar's house. I'm sitting in my room now staring at my phone. Rani's mom's number is right there in my contacts. After three weeks of hell, I'm done covering for her. I pick up the phone and dial her. Mom answered on the second ring. Hi, sweetie. How's Bible study going? Actually, I wanted to tell you a joke. I said calmly, Ronnie is not here. She's at Oscar Miller's house. Just kidding. Well, actually, not kidding. The line went dead 20 minutes later. My phone exploded with text from everyone at Oscar's house. Apparently, he hosted a party. Renee's parents had burst in, her mom in house slippers, her dad still in his pastoral collar. They found Renee and Oscar on his couch, her shirt unbuttoned, his hands under her bra, the same bra she'd mocked me for wearing. Her mom dragged Renee out by her arm while she sobbed and begged. Her dad was shouting about deception and sin in front of everyone. 30 teenagers watched the pastor's perfect daughter get hauled out half dressed. By morning, Renee's parents had pulled her from school, homeschool only, no phone, no car, no friends until she turned 18. Church members whispered about the scandal. Oscar dumped her immediately, saying he didn't want the drama. Rani still hasn't left her house in three weeks. Her parents installed cameras on every door. Someone saw her once watching from her bedroom window.

My father materialized beside her. You look different, older. It's been 5 years, people age. My mother's voice cracked. Do you have any idea how much you've hurt us? The audacity nearly made me laugh. How much I've hurt you. You can't just disappear because of some silly grudge. Silly grudge. You skipped my 7th birthday from Madison's costume fitting. You missed my high school graduation where I was valedictorian because she had a dance competition. You refused to help with my college applications, but bought her a car at 16. And then when I achieved something genuinely incredible, you couldn't show up for three hours. We sent you money, my father said, weekly. I didn't need money. I needed my parents. Silence stretched between us. What do you want? My mother finally asked. An apology. Fine. I'm sorry. Can we move past this now? I don't want anything from you. I stopped wanting anything five years ago. I walked away. My hands weren't shaking. My voice hadn't wavered. Uncle Robert found me later. Your father asked about you last Christmas, wanted to know if you were okay. Of course, he was surprised. He never thought I'd survive without their approval. Seven years later, I'm 29. I gave a keynote to 1,000 women in tech about building success without a support system. The standing ovation lasted five minutes. When my father had a heart attack, he asked for me. I sent flowers. With a card wishing you a speedy recovery, professional, distant, appropriate for someone I barely knew. My mother called it heartless. Madison called me a monster on Facebook. But I'm not heartless. Just finally completely free. They lost a daughter who would have moved mountains to earn their pride. They lost patents with their last name attached. They lost someone extraordinary. And I gained everything. Seven years ago, they made a choice to skip my MIT graduation for a ballet recital that didn't matter. They probably don't even remember Madison's performance that day. But I remember everything about mine. That was the day I cut them out. They just didn't realise it until much, much later. And by then, it was far too late to matter.

Detective Walsh asked Lily to explain why she'd called 9 1 1 from her mother's phone during her own birthday party. And Lily reached under the picnic table where she'd apparently stashed a backpack we hadn't noticed. She pulled out a purple folder labeled evidence in her careful handwriting. Inside were papers, photos, and what looked like printed screenshots. She played them out on the table, one by one, like she'd practiced this presentation. My dad has been stealing from my college fund for eight months, she said. Clearly he's gambling online every night. I have bank statements showing he took $23,000. Detective Walsh picked up the first document. It was indeed a bank statement with my name on it, showing transfers from an education savings account to my checking account. Natalie made a sound like she'd been punched, started to speak, but Walsh held up her hand. Lily continued, he told me in river that we'd have money for college, but he's been lying. I checked the account using Mom's computer when she thought I was doing homework. Balance is almost zero now. The next item Lily presented was a printed screenshot showing my laptop screen open to an online poker site. She'd somehow captured it with time stamps showing 2:00am from last Monday. I remembered that night. I'd been sure I could win back what I'd lost. Just one more hand. The screenshot showed my balance. Negative 40. Eight hundred dollars. He's always on His laptop late at night, Lily explained to the detective. Says he's working, but I heard him swearing at his computer. I waited until he fell asleep and took pictures with Mom's phone. There were six more screenshots, each from different nights, each showing different gambling sites, each showing me deeper in the hole. The total losses added up to more than just the college fund. Way more. Detective Walsh looked at Natalie. Miss, this is Reeves. Did you know about any of this? Natalie shook her head, tears streaming down her face. She'd grabbed river and was holding him so tight. He was squirming. I tried to explain that I was going to pay it back, that I just hit a bad streak, that I had a system that would work, but the words sounded pathetic, even to me. Officer Brennan asked if I wanted to stop talking and maybe consult a lawyer. Lily wasn't finished. She pulled out phone records showing something no one had expected.

They got nastier when I refused. Heather called my employer, claiming I was harassing their family. Nolan showed up at my apartment with two men. He called witnesses, tried to force their way in with papers, started sending photos of my dad with messages like he doesn't even remember you exist and signing would give you closure. The worst was a video of him mumbling in his sleep while Heather asked if he wanted to see his daughter. When he said yes, she told him I was on my way, then filmed him waiting for hours for someone who wasn't allowed to come. Two weeks ago, the nurse called at midnight. My dad was dying. Maybe hours left. I rushed to the hospital, begged security to let me through. They called Nolan, who came down looking annoyed at being woken, stood there in his expensive jacket, telling security I was delusional, that his stepfather never had other children. I pulled out my birth certificate, childhood photos, anything to prove I was his daughter. Heather arrived and started screaming that I was causing a scene during their father's final moments. I was trying to steal their grief. Security started moving me toward the exit while I could hear machines beeping upstairs. He died at Sunrise. The funeral home called Nolan first. Out of habit, he started making arrangements for a service that didn't include me. That's When the estate lawyer called us all in for the reading, Nolan and Heather showed up in designer clothes they'd bought with the fundraiser money. Already. Discussing which properties they'd take, the lawyer started reading. My dad had been broke for years before the stroke. The house they'd sold had three mortgages. The savings they'd spent were loans he'd taken against his life insurance. The medical bills they'd been paying were a fraction of what was owed, $3 million in debt between medical costs and previous loans. But here was the best part. They'd signed as guarantors on everything, as his medical proxies. Every debt was now legally theirs. The fundraiser money they'd spent on themselves had to be returned or they'd face fraud charges. The designer clothes, the cars, the vacations, all of it bought with money meant for medical bills, they were now personally responsible for. Heather fainted. Actually fainted? No. Colin tried to argue they've been tricked. The lawyer explained that power of attorney meant taking on financial responsibility, not just control. They've been so eager to cut me out, they've never read what they were signing. I inherited nothing because there was nothing to inherit. But I also inherited no debt because they'd made sure my name wasn't on anything.

I submitted an application, too, in February through my guidance counselor. There was this long silence. What's your counselor's name? My voice was shaking. Now missus Connie.

So why didn't you get it? That's exactly what I need to find out. I'm getting my supervisor. A man gets on the phone and his voice sounds angry. Walk me through everything that happened. I explained how missus Connie gave me the application and told me I was perfect for it, how she said I didn't meet the GPA requirement and how Olivia won even though her family has money.

Stay by your phone. He hangs up. I barely sleep at night. The next afternoon, two people in suits walk into school and go straight to the principal's office and they stay in there for hours. Then during last period, missus Connie just walks out of the building in the middle of the school day and her classroom stays closed the rest of the week. The following Monday, the principal's voice comes over the intercom during lunch and the entire cafeteria goes completely silent. I have an important announcement. After an investigation, we discovered Missus Connie had been running a scheme for years. She marked qualified low income students as ineligible, then only submitted applications from wealthy families who made large donations to the school athletics program. In exchange, these families paid for her personal expenses. She falsified dozens of applications and stole opportunities from students who desperately needed them. Missus Connie has been terminated and is facing 12 counts of fraud and embezzlement. The organization called me that same night and told me I was getting the full scholarship. Three other kids from my class got theirs back, too. My mom cried when I told her.

The detective digs further. Divorce a mad woman, which is what I am trying to do, I retorted harshly back. What makes you think that your wife is mad or insane? Mister Waters asks. Instead, she tried to stab me with a knife, poisoned me through my food with my nut allergy by cooking with nut oil and sprinkling nuts within the food. Thank the Lord I had my Epipen on me and the child missing was before we married, which I didn't find out until six months ago, I explained. The detectives eyes are now narrowed. The same time you filed for divorce? As he slid the divorce paperwork to me, yes, I answered. Why? Mister Waters continued to dig. I wet my lips slowly because she told me the child had died. I, it didn't feel right with me. The detective suddenly looked concerned at me. Is there a chance your wife forged your signatures? Honestly, sir, nothing would surprise me at this point, I answer as honestly and as truthfully as I can. Please wait here. The detective sweeps the files back into the folder and leaves the room. Cassie wouldn't have forged my signatures, I pause, staring at the desk or would she? Hours pace. Once again, I start pacing back and forth through the room. She couldn't have hurt her own child, but why tell me the child died when the officers only have a missing case on the Child, I muttered to myself as I pace. The door opens to see Detective Waters again, only this time he's extremely pale. We are sorry for detaining you, Quinn. You are free to go. What? What changed? I asked, staring at of waters. Your wife, Cassie, confessed to forging your signatures. She also forged your signatures and had unalived her child. By forging your signature, she was able to hide her child's body by cremation. I felt sick to my stomach. She was going to unalive me, wasn't she? I asked. The detective looks that way, Quinn. Blunt and brutal honesty. As soon as I left the police station, I immediately went to the courthouse with the documents Detective Waters had given me. I need a divorce and restraining order ASAP, I told the receptionist. She nods. Are you Mister Black? Yes, I answered. Detective Waters contacted us and the judge is waiting for you.

She did not care. She said I was drunk and that she did not feel safe sleeping next to me. I had one beer over the course of two hours. I was completely fine. Then she told me to sleep on the couch. I said, no, it is my bed. Pay half the rent on this apartment and I bought the bed frame with my own money from my last job. I was not about to sleep on our crappy couch that we got for free off Facebook Marketplace because she decided to make up some story in her head. She got even more mad that I said no. She ripped the blanket off me and grabbed my pillow and threw it across the room. It hit my desk lamp and the lamp fell off the desk and smashed on the floor. The light bulb shattered everywhere. I. I told her to stop being such a bitch and to just go to sleep so we could talk about it in the morning when she was not being crazy. That was apparently the wrong thing to say. She grabbed her phone and her charger and stormed out of the bedroom. I heard the front door slam like 30 seconds later. I did not go after her. I did not text her. I did not call her. I just laid there looking at the ceiling. I figured she went to her parents. House since that is like 15 minutes away. I got up and swept up the broken glass from the lamp and then went back to bed. I fell asleep around 11. The next morning, I woke up to like 20 texts from her mom. Stuff like, how could you treat my daughter this way and you are a horrible boyfriend and she deserves so much better. Her mom said she showed up crying at 1 in the morning saying I got drunk and screamed at her and threw things, which is just a complete lie. She threw my pillow. She broke the lamp. I had one drink. I texted her mom back and said that was not what happened and that she could check the security camera in our apartment hallway if she wanted proof I was not stumbling around drunk. Our building has cameras everywhere. Her mom did not respond. My girlfriend finally texted me around noon. She said I owed her an apology for making her feel unsafe and for calling her a name. I told her I was not apologizing for refusing to sleep on the couch in my own apartment. He said if I did not apologize, she was not coming back. I said, okay, then do not come back. She has been staying at her parents house for 5 days now. She keeps posting sad quotes on Instagram about toxic relationships.

So my sister in law Jenny is literally the most intimidating person I've ever met. She shows up to family stuff maybe twice a year tops. And when she does, she barely talks to anyone. My mom swears Jenny's dad was in her high school class and he had this dead eyed stare that made teachers scared of him. She's convinced the guy's actually dangerous or something. Jenny does this thing where she just stares at you not like a normal look. She's studying you and finding every weak spot you got. It makes you feel like you're 2 inches tall and the dumbest person alive. My brother Kyle is totally fine with it. Somehow he thinks she's just shy or whatever, but the rest of us try to avoid her. Last month they had a baby, a little girl named Avery. She's 9 months old now and honestly pretty cute with dark hair and these big round eyes. Kyle invited me over to their place for lunch and I figured I should try to bond with my niece since I barely see her. I got there around noon and Jenny was in the kitchen doing dishes, gave me that look when I walked in, didn't say hi or anything, just that stare. Kyle was way more normal about it and handed me Avery after like 10 minutes of small talk. The second I took her, she locked Eyes with me, same exact stare as her mom. Not crying or fussing, just staring straight into my soul like she was judging every choice I ever made. This baby, who can't even walk yet, made me feel like I failed a test I didn't know I was taking. I panicked and just said it out loud. Jesus Christ, it's genetic. Kyle stopped mid sentence. Jenny turned around from the sink. I realized what I said and tried to hand Avery back real quick. Sorry, I, I gotta use the bathroom. I didn't actually go.

He said it like he was doing me a favor, like I should be grateful he was giving me extra time. I nodded and ordered Thai food delivery to his apartment. The next week, I came over and made this huge dinner at his place, egg, mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables swimming in butter, fresh bread. He watched me eat it all in my oversized sweater and actually laughed this bitter, mean laugh. I think we both know this is over, he said. You've clearly gained weight instead of losing it. This is pathetic. I finished my plate and went home. The final day of his ultimatum arrived. He texted me that morning saying we were done, that I'd had my chance and failed spectacularly, that he'd given me every opportunity to change. I asked him to meet me at his apartment that evening, one final dinner together. He agreed, probably because he wanted to gloat one more time. I showed up that evening in a fitted black dress I bought the week before. His face went completely blank when he opened the door. The dress showed everything, my tone and arms, my defined waist, my flat stomach. I'd lost 19 pounds and gained muscle in places I didn't even know I had muscles. He couldn't form words, just stare at me like I was a stranger. But I watched you eat like a pig. I walked past him calmly. Every single meal you watched me eat was calorie calculated. I ate precisely what I needed in front of you, then barely ate anything the rest of the day. His mouth hung open. Plus, I've been going to the gym every morning at five, two months straight. You never knew because you only saw me at dinner or on weekends when I wore baggy clothes. But why? I wanted to see what you do, I said. I wanted to see if you'd support me, if you'd ask how, how I was feeling, if you'd care about anything other than my body. I turned toward the door. You failed. Every single day you failed. And now we're done. He was about to say something. We're breaking up. Don't contact me. He didn't take it well. The texts started immediately. Desperate, pathetic. Three days later, his roommate called me. Listen, I need to tell you something. He said he had a bet with his friends that if he could get you to lose weight, they'd pay him $500. He was going to dump you anyway once the two months were up. Sorry, I wasn't his girlfriend working on self improvement. I was his payday after all.

Not my last name or my parents money, just me. I took a deep breath. Sarah, I loved you, past tense. She noticed I spent two years building myself into someone your parents would approve of, not because I needed their approval, but because I wanted to prove them wrong. And you know what? I realized what? It didn't matter. They were never going to accept me and you were never going to stand up to them until now, she whispered. Two years too late. I, you let them convince you I wasn't enough. And instead of fighting for us, you walked away, too. I didn't see you chasing after me. That's not fair, isn't it? I asked gently. You chose their approval over us. I don't blame you for that, but I can't be your backup plan when the approved option doesn't work out. I'm not here because Jonathan didn't work out. I'm here because I finally realized what I lost stood. I love you. I know, but love isn't enough when you won't fight for it. She started crying again. So that's it. We're done. We've been done for two years. I'm just finally accepting it. What about everything we had? I smiled sadly. We had potential, but potential doesn't mean anything if you don't fight for it when it matters. Sarah left that night broken, lost. I felt terrible, but I also Felt free. Three months later, I met Emma at a charity car show. She was a teacher, down to earth, real. We talked for hours. She didn't care that I owned a business, didn't care about money or status. She cared about who I was. Six months later, I introduced her to my family. My mom pulled me aside. She's wonderful. She is not like Sarah. No, she's better. She chose me when I had nothing to prove. Last month, I proposed. Emma said yes. We're getting married in the fall. Small ceremony, just people who matter. I heard through mutual friends that Sarah's doing okay, working at a non profit, living on her own, finally standing up to her parents. I'm happy for her, really, but I don't regret my decision. You'll never be good enough for our daughter. Her father's words haunted me for years, pushed me to prove him wrong. But in the end, I realized something. I was always good enough. Sarah just needed to believe it, too. And by the time she did, I'd already moved on. Not out of spite, not, not out of revenge, but because I finally understood my worth and I wasn't going to settle for someone who took two years and a failed engagement to see it. Sometimes the best revenge isn't proving people wrong. It's building a life so good that their opinion stops mattering. Her parents said I'd never be good enough. Turns out I was always enough. Just not for them. And that was perfectly fine with me.

My mom clanked her fork against her glass and stood up. Before we sing Happy Birthday to my daughter, I want everyone to know we're also celebrating Moira's half birthday today. My 16 year old sister Moira bounced up from her chair and rushed to stand behind my birthday cake giggling. Another birthday stolen right in front of me. It's my 18th birthday, I said. Can I have just this one birthday for myself? Mom stared daggers at me. Don't be selfish. Birthdays are meant for sharing and we do this every year, dad added. Why are you suddenly making it a problem? But that was exactly the problem. Every year I had to deal with my parents putting Moira first. And sure, it was cute back when Moira was 3 and I was 5. I mean, who wouldn't say all when your toddler sister helps blow out your candles for the first time? But that was the thing. We were kids. But that cute incident didn't stop there. During Christmas, my parents let her tear open her gifts first before turning around and opening mine too. You're too old to be excited with opening presents anyway, mom said. I was 8. My 10th birthday dinner was at Chuck E. Cheese instead of the Japanese restaurant I wanted, all because Moira threw a tantrum about wanting pizza. My 12th birthday got cancelled when Moira woke up with a really bad Tummy ache, which happened to suddenly disappear an hour after telling everyone not to show up. And on my 16th birthday, my parents forgot all about it. So this year was really it. I was an adult and didn't have to put up with their crap any longer. I look down at my birthday cake with Moira's name written beautifully and mine squeezed into the bottom corner and sloppy letters completely misspelled and just lost it. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear. I blew out the candles right there, every single one before Moira could make her move. The singing instantly fell apart. Every person in the room went completely silent. What the heck, Moira shrieked. Why did you blow out my cake? Our cake, I said with a smile. I grabbed the presents my parents neatly wrapped on the side for my sister and ripped open the first box. AirPods. Wow. I've been asking for this for four years. Those are Moira's half birthday presents. Mom stood up so fast her chair scraped against the floor. Exactly. I can't wait to share it. I opened another box. Ooh, a Lululemon gift card. Thanks so much. I carefully opened the rest of my gifts, making snarky comments like, oh, Moira, this isn't the colour Moira likes. Guess I'll just keep.

She told me Sienna's testimony was bad. Sienna said Ryder drove her somewhere isolated, beat her within an inch of her life, then dumped her near her house around 10 at night. The neighbor already confirmed hearing them argue at 7. What about the bruises on his knuckles? I asked the lawyer. Looked at her notes. Rider claims he punched his steering wheel after dropping her off because he was so angry. Everything he said sounded like an excuse. I went back to see rider. He was desperate.

Then Malcolm's birthday party, car trouble, my birthday dinner, another work emergency. This was the guy who once drove two hours in a snowstorm just to bring me soup when I had the flu. Now he couldn't make it across town for major events. I mentioned it to Malcolm. Dave's going through something at work. He'll come around. I asked Malcolm's mom if Dave was okay. Oh, honey.

I felt something cold spread through my chest. I'm calling the Vital Records office tomorrow. My mom's eyes filled with tears. Please don't. Please just let this go. Cancel the trip. I'll give you the money back. Just stop asking questions. Her voice was desperate, begging. My dad walked toward the garage. The door slammed. His car started. He didn't come home that night. The next morning, I called the vital records office. A woman answered and I gave her my birth certificate number. I heard typing, then silence. Ma'am, this number was never issued by our state. It matches a pattern we have flagged for fraudulent documents. My entire body went numb. Someone created this certificate illegally. I'm transferring you to our Fraud Investigation unit. The line clicked. A man's voice came through. Detective Caldwell, I need your full name and address. He didn't sound surprised by any of my answers. Someone will be contacting you very soon. Do not discuss this with anyone, especially not the people who gave you that document. Three days later, someone knocked on my door. I looked through the people and saw two people in dark suits, federal badges on their belts. He pulls out a photograph. I'm looking at a young couple outside a daycare holding a sign with a date 23 years ago. The woman is crying. Her face is red and swollen. The officer speaks. Baby stolen from daycare in Oregon. Parents dropped off their two month old Daughter. That morning when they came back, she was gone. Daycare worker left mid shift with a baby carrier. A witness saw her walking out with it covered. He pulls out another photo, a baby's shoulder, a small birthmark shaped like a comma. My hand goes to my own shoulder. The officer see, may I? I pull up my sleeve. The exact same Mark in the exact same place. The room starts spinning. The other agent slides a paper across the table, a birth record. I'm staring at the stolen baby's birthday and it's my birthday. The daycare worker had been creating fake identity documents. That's how she disappeared. We found your fraudulent certificate in her pattern database. Same format, same method. I can barely process what he's saying. The officers exchange a look. We believe the people you've been living with are the ones who took you. I think about every birthday party, every scraped knee they kissed, every time they told me they loved me. How do I feel about people who raised me with nothing but love, but stole me from complete strangers? They were arrested three days later. The couple in that photograph never stopped searching for me. My entire childhood was built on a lie.

I grinned and turned to Reese. You know, if we ever have a daughter, I've always loved the name Maxine. The soda nearly slipped from his hand. He coughed and stammered, saying he'd prefer other names. But his mom insisted Maxine would be a lovely name. What made you think of it? She asked me. Reese turned to me with wide eyes, clearly wondering if I knew, but it wasn't time to drop it yet. Well, it's a name that's very hard to forget. Just so lovely and unique, I said, acting oblivious. After that night, Reese's paranoia got worse. He started watching me constantly, panicking every time I mentioned anything close to Maxine's name. He was so stressed, he picked up smoking cigarettes just like she did. His text to her showed how paranoid he was. I thought all of this would have put an end to his affair, make him lose us both. But I was wrong. Reese announced he had a work trip coming up, a conference in another city. On the day of Maxine's birthday, this was it, what I've been waiting for. The night before his trip, I did my research, found the exact hotel they were staying at, one of those down low, illegal ones that allows you to smoke in the rooms. Instead of confronting him, I helped him pack, folded his shirts and pants neatly into a suitcase like the Perfect Wife. Then without him knowing, I Took the perfume bottle and sprayed the flammable perfume everywhere, on his shirts, his jacket, even his ties. Reece laughed when he stepped into the room to pick up the suitcase. Honey, you've practically marinated my wardrobe. I smiled. It's so you can smell me even when you're away. I watched him carry the suitcase into his car and drive off. That was the last time I saw him like that because that night at 2 in the morning, I got the call I've been waiting for. Hello? Is this Reese's wife? This is a nurse from Halter's General Hospital. Your husband's been in an accident. I grinned, my heart racing. When I got to the hospital, I rushed in completely breathless and in tears. Where is he? Where's my Reese? I begged. They LED me to a room filled with doctors, nurses and off. One of them pulled me aside and explained what happened. There was a fire inside the room. Apparently a cigarette your husband was smoking set his clothes on fire. I gasped. How could that even happen? The office surfrowned. His clothes had flammable perfume on them. I'm sorry to say this, but your husband was having an affair. We found the exact perfume bottle in the woman's makeup bag. We suspect she planned this but got caught in the fire as well. I stuck around playing the heartbroken wife. Soon, Reece woke up, confused and in pain. When he saw me, I said nothing. Just Pulled out a small perfume bottle and started spraying it around his bed. So honey, about Maxine, full story on channel linked below.

My brother Logan, served 8 years in the Marines, came back with this attitude like everyone owed him something. My wife, Iris, and I had been married for six months when he showed up unannounced one Saturday morning. I was still in my boxers making coffee when I heard the door unlock. Logan had a key from when he'd stayed with us during his transition out. He just walked in, boots still on, dropped his duffel bag in our living room. Iris came out of the bedroom in her robe. Logan didn't even acknowledge her, opened our fridge and started making himself breakfast. I asked what he was doing here. He said he needed a place to crash for a few weeks while he figured things out. Didn't ask. Just told me. Iris looked at me, then went back to the bedroom without saying anything. Logan noticed you got a problem with me being here. I put my coffee down. You didn't knock. You didn't call. You didn't ask. He laughed. It's family. I don't need permission. I walked over and held out my hand key. Now his smile dropped. You serious? You, you wanna stay here? You ask first. You knock. You respect that this is Iris's home, too, or you can figure it out somewhere else. Just stared at me. Then he started unpacking his duffle bag right there on our Couch pulled out a hoodie, some jeans, laid them across our furniture like he was moving in permanently. I'm not leaving, he said. You're my brother. You don't turn away, family. I looked at Iris standing in the hallway. She had her arms crossed watching this whole thing play out. I could see it in her face. He wasn't going to say anything, but she was done. I turned back to Logan. Pack your stuff. You've got five minutes. He laughed again. Or what? You're gonna throw me out? Mom would love that. Her son who served his country getting kicked to the curb by his ungrateful brother. I didn't a move, just stood there. Logan kept going.

I agreed, packed my things and left. Two years later, she knocked on my door crying. But what I told her changed everything. You'll never be good enough for our daughter. Her father said it at Sunday dinner. I was sitting across from him, fork halfway to my mouth. Her mother nodded in agreement. Sarah deserves someone with ambition, with a future, not a mechanic. I was 24, working in an auto shop, saving every penny, going to community college at night for business management. But to them, I was grease under fingernails, blue collar beneath their daughter. Sarah squeezed my hand under the table. Don't listen to them. But I was listening. Her father continued. We've supported this relationship long enough. It's time Sarah found someone appropriate, someone from her world. I set down my fork, looked at Sarah, at her parents. You're right. Sarah's eyes widened. What? I'm not good enough for her. Not the way I am now. I stood. So I'm going to leave. Stop wasting her time. Stop holding her back. Sarah jumped up. No, you're not doing this. Yes, I am. I looked at her parents. Thank you for dinner, for the clarity. I walked out. Sarah followed me to my truck. You're really leaving? You deserve better than this. Then constantly defending me to them. I kissed her forehead. If we're meant to be, we'll find our way back. I drove away, didn't look back. The break up nearly destroyed me, but it also focused me. I stopped going to bars, stopped wasting money, stopped making excuses. I finished my degree in 18 months, used my savings to buy the failing auto shop where I worked, rebranded it, modernized it, built a reputation for honest work and fair prices. Within a year, I had three locations. Within two, I had eight. I hired good people, paid them well, treated them with respect. Business exploded. By year two, I was clearing half a million annually. Bought a house. Nothing flashy, just solid. I dated occasionally, nothing serious. Part of me was still hung up on Sarah. Then one night my doorbell rang. Sarah stood there, mascara running, eyes swollen. Can we talk? Let her in. She sat on my couch shaking. I made a mistake. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life. What happened? I got engaged to Jonathan, the guy my parents set me up with, lawyer, Ivy League, perfect on paper. She wiped her eyes. He's awful, controlling, condescending, makes me feel small. And my parents love him because he looks good at parties. I stayed quiet. I called off the wedding yesterday. My parents disowned me, said I'm ungrateful that I'm throwing away my future. She looked up at me. I.

She laid them out on the table one by one like she'd practiced this presentation. My dad has been stealing from my college fund for eight months, she said. Clearly, he's gambling online every night. I have bank statements showing he took $23,000. Detective Walsh picked up the first document. It was indeed a bank statement with my name on it, showing transfers from an education savings account, my checking account. Natalie made a sound like she'd been punched. I started to speak, but Walsh held up her hand. Lily continued. He told me in river that we'd have money for college, but he's been lying. I checked the account using Mom's computer when she thought I was doing homework. Balance is almost zero now. The next item Lily presented was a printed screenshot showing my laptop screen open to an online poker site. She'd somehow captured it with time stamps showing 2:00am from last Monday. I remembered that night I'd been sure I could win back what I'd lost, just one more hand. The screenshot showed my balance negative 40 eight hundred dollars. He's always on his laptop late at night, Lily explained to the detective. He says he's working, but I heard him swearing at his computer. I waited until he fell asleep and took pictures with Mom's phone. There were six more screenshots, each from different nights. Each showing different gambling sites, each showing me deeper in the hole. Total losses added up to more than just the college fund, way more. Detective Walsh looked at Natalie Missus Reeves. Did you know about any of this? Natalie shook her head, tears streaming down her face. She'd grabbed river and was holding him so tight he was squirming. I tried to explain that I was going to pay it back, that I just hit a bad streak, that I had a system that would work. But the words sounded pathetic, even to me. Officer Brennan asked if I wanted to stop talking and maybe consult a lawyer. Lily wasn't finished. She pulled out phone records showing something no one had expected.

The officers arrived while we were singing Happy Birthday. Two uniformed police and a woman in plain clothes carrying a badge and clipboard walked straight through our backyard gate, while my daughter Lily sat at the head of the picnic table with her hands folded in her lap. Wait! The singing stopped midverse. Seventeen children and their parents froze with cake forks halfway to their mouths. Natalie dropped the camera she'd been using to record the moment. The female officer, whose badge read Detective Walsh, walked directly to Lily and knelt beside her chair. You're the one who called. Lily nodded once, then pointed at me. That's my dad. He needs to be arrested. My hands went numb. The backyard spun. Every parent stared at me with identical expressions of horror and disgust. Miss Missus Pemberton grabbed her twins and started backing toward the gate. Mister Lou pulled out his phone and started recording. I opened my mouth to explain, to defend myself, to say anything that would make sense of what was happening. But nothing came out except a strangled sound that made me look even more guilty. Detective Walsh asked everyone except immediate family to leave, which triggered a mass exodus that felt like being abandoned during a house fire. Parents grabbed their children and ran, leaving behind wrapped presents and half eaten cake. Within 90 Seconds, our backyard went from Celebration to crime scene. Lily's best friend Sophie was physically carried away by her mother, who shot me a look that could have strip paint. Bounce house rental company guy unplugged his equipment and left without asking for payment. Natalie stood frozen by the cake table, her face completely white. Our son, river, who was six, started crying and asking why everyone was leaving his sister's party. Detective Walsh's partner, Officer Brennan, positioned himself between me and Lily, like I might lunge for her. I raised my hand slowly, trying to show I wasn't a threat. But the gesture made me look like I was surrendering, which maybe I was. Lily sat perfectly still in her birthday crown, watching me with an expression I'd never seen before. Not scared, not angry, just cold and determined. Detective Walsh asked Lily to explain why she'd called 9 1 1 from her mother's phone during her own birthday party.

My boyfriend took one look at me and knew something was horribly wrong. Baby, what happened? I just broke down, told him everything, the comments, the humiliation, that disgusting thing she said about him. His face turned red. I've never seen him so angry. His fists were clenched so tight. His knuckles went white. I can't believe she said that to you. How could anyone be so cruel? He pulled me close. You're beautiful, perfect. You deserve so much better than this.

I was in the kitchen making coffee when she shouted across the apartment loud enough for everyone to hear, why are your thighs jiggling like that? Do you even work out seriously?

Let us manage it for you just until you're settled. You kicked me out at 13. I said, I think I'll manage. Their lawyer tried to challenge the will. That's when Caldwell dropped the hammer. First, he said, sliding documents across the table. At 16, Graham legally adopted Noah, which means you have no legal standing in this estate. My mother's mouth fell open. That's impossible. Second, Caldwell continued, Graham hired investigators. We have documented proof of every attempt you made to extort money from him over the years, phone records, bank transfers, emails. Their lawyer started sweating. Third, Caldwell said, opening a letter, Graham left a message. Noah, if they've shown up, I told you they would, don't let them take what you've earned. Family isn't who brings you into the world. It's who shows up when the world walks out. My father slammed the table. This is theft. Finally, Caldwell said, the nuclear clause. If anyone can test this will, all assets transfer automatically to the Children's Cancer Foundation. But only parties with legal standing can trigger that clause, and you have none. I leaned back. So go ahead, sue me. The only thing you'll win is a charity donation, mom screamed. After everything we gave you, like what? I interrupted the night you dumped me or the 14 years of silence?

Mom ran her hand along the bannister as if she already lived there. I pointed to the camera in the corner. Say it louder. Judges love this material. Last time I saw them was on the driveway. Camera driving slowly past the gate, windows down, staring like tourists who couldn't afford the ticket. Inside, Graham told me once, some people grow when they lose power, others shrink. I'm standing in the office now. Quarterly stats are up 30%. Three new stores under construction. My parents are still out there somewhere shrinking.

Why didn't you tell us? We could have helped. We could have cosigned a lease, lent you money for deposits. That's when the real shame hit. Pride had kept me silent. My parents had struggled their whole lives, finally reaching financial stability in their 50s. Dad had worked construction for 30 years to pay for our house. Mom had cleaned offices at night to afford our school supplies. The idea of asking them to risk their good credit for my problems felt selfish. Actually, when the situation was temporary and I was handling it, my brother, who'd been quietly listening, suddenly got animated. Dude, you could have stayed in my apartment. I've got a couch, extra space. Why are you sleeping in parking lots when family is 20 minutes away? The question hit harder than I expected. I've been so focused on maintaining independence, proving I could handle adult problems alone, that I'd chosen car seats over asking for help. The conversation shifted when mom asked about my daily routine. I described my morning gym visits, eating breakfast at coffee shops, working full days while keeping my situation secret and finding safe places to sleep. Dad looked increasingly upset as I detailed the logistics of car living, where to park, how to stay warm, which gas stations had the cleanest bathrooms at 3 a m. What surprised me was their anger wasn't directed at me. Dad was furious about the identity theft, demanding details about the investigation. Frustrated that the system had failed to protect me, mom was researching credit repair strategies on her phone during dinner. My brother was already pulling up apartment listings, offering to co sign applications immediately. Within two hours, my family had transformed my eight month nightmare into a soluble problem with multiple backup plans. Dad called his friend who worked at a credit union about special lending programs. Mom contacted a lawyer she knew about expediting identity theft cases. My brother cleared out his spare room that same night, insisting I move in immediately while we figured out permanent housing.

Three weeks ago, my brother's girlfriend posted an Instagram story. At midnight, my whole family at this fancy Italian place downtown, the one we only go to for birthdays. Everyone dressed up, laughing, wine glasses raised in a toast. I wasn't there. Didn't even know about it. I stared at that photo for 20 minutes, trying to convince myself it was old. I called my mom the next day. Hey, casual. Like I wasn't freaking out. Hey. Saw you guys went to Giovanni's. How was it? She got this weird guilty tone. Oh, it was last minute. We thought you were busy with work. My work schedules. In our family group chat. They knew I was free. Then it kept happening. Brunch at the new spot on fifth, game night at my sister's, A weekend at the Lakehouse. Every time I found out through social media or group chat references I didn't understand. They'd talk about things, and I'd ask what they meant. You had to be there, they'd say. The group chat had become two conversations. The one I could see and the one I couldn't. Last Sunday, I showed up early. Got there at 5:50 instead of six. Door was unlocked, so I walked in, they were already eating. All of them. Plates full, wine poured. Mid conversation. In 29 years, we've never started without everyone there. The room went silent. My youngest sister wouldn't look at me. My brother stared at his phone. Mom started talking too fast. About nothing. Work and weather. Barely breathing between words. I sat down in my spot. Nobody passed me anything. I had to make my own plate while everyone watched. When I came back, dad said, we're just tired. Long week. That's when I saw the new photo on the mantle. All of them dressed fancy outside some venue with string lights. A wedding. Recent, based on my sister's new haircut. I grabbed the frame. Whose wedding is this? Dead silence. Everyone doing that thing where they're having a conversation with just their eyes. Mom finally spoke. Your cousin Peyton's. You weren't invited. Peyton, who I grew up with, who lived 10 minutes away my entire childhood. Who I taught to ride a bike. Who came to every one of my birthdays. Why wasn't I invited? Mom looked at Dad. Dad looked at my brother. My sister was crying. She said, we didn't want to tell you like this. Peyton's

She made us promise not to mention it. We've been keeping it quiet for months. I was still holding the frame. Peyton and I haven't talked since Christmas, but we never fought. I don't understand what I did. My brother took a deep breath. It's not about something you did. It's about who she married. Peyton's marrying Jade. Your ex girlfriend. Jade? The one you dated for six years. The frame fell out of my hands and break just bounced on carpet and lay their face up. Peyton in her white dress, smiling bigger than I've ever seen her smile. And next to her arm around her waist was Jade. My Jade. The woman I was going to propose to before she left me two years ago, saying she needed to find herself. Apparently, she found herself with my cousin. Mom started crying. They've been together for two years since right after you broke up. Peyton made us promise not to tell you. She thought it would destroy for you. We've been having separate dinners to celebrate them, to plan the wedding, to talk about everything we couldn't say in front of you. Every time you weren't invited, it was because they were going to be there. I looked around the table. Every single one of them knew. For two years, they'd been lying to my face. Having secret gatherings, celebrating a relationship built on my heartbreak. Nobody thought I deserved to. Dad said We were trying to protect you. I walked out, didn't say a word, got in my car and left. My phone's been blowing up since last night, but I haven't answered. They're saying I overreacted, that I'm being dramatic, that I need to be happy for Peyton and move on. But here's what I can't stop thinking about. It's not even about Jade anymore. It's that my entire family chose her over me. They chose my cousin's happiness over mine, and they decided I was the one who needed to be left out, lied to, kept in the dark, like I was the problem. And now they're mad that I found out. Like I'm the villain in this story.

They demanded millions, but the lawyer's secret claws left them with nothing. My parents abandoned me with a note on the kitchen counter when I was 13. Uncle Graham will take care of you. We're sorry. That single sentence was supposed to replace 13 years. Mom's daycare had failed. Dad's used car lot was bleeding cash into casino slot machines. Wasn't surprised they left. I was surprised they bothered writing anything at all. Uncle Graham showed up in a black suit and said, pack one suitcase, not two. He wasn't warm. He was efficient. His Victorian mansion had rules. Shoes off, homework at the desk, one hour of piano daily. Break a rule, lose a privilege. No yelling, no drama, just consequences. I tested him constantly that first year. Skipped piano, rolled my eyes, stayed up past curfew waiting for him to call CPS and ship me somewhere else like my parents did. He never did. He punished me then stayed for breakfast the next morning. By 16, he legally adopted me. By 18, I was managing his luxury furniture company. By 27, I was running it while he fought leukemia. Eight months later, he died. The funeral was small. His lawyer called a week after we're reading the will. Friday, I walked into that marble conference, this room, expecting business partners and maybe a charity. Instead, my parents were sitting there in outlet store blazers and Rehearsed smiles. They hadn't called in 14 years, but they he'd shown up for the obituary. My mother wore fake pearls. My father had on a too tight navy suit. When they saw me, mom gasped. Noah, look at you, honey. The lawyer opened the folder. Graham Whitaker leaves his estate entirely to his legal ward, Noah Grant. Primary residence valued at $1.8 million. Cash savings of $2 million, 70% ownership of Whitaker home collections valued at approximately $45 million. My mother gasped. That's, that's everything. My father leaned forward. This is outrageous. Noah needs guidance. We should be co managers. I laughed. You couldn't guide me to a bus stop. Mom's tears started. Noah, honey.

Stop recording and help me! She shrieked. But, Linda, you're showing us the proper way. I want to remember this. She. I threw a potato at my head. Then she started running hot water over the frozen Turkey. Amy walked in and said, mom, you're gonna poison everyone! Linda snapped, I've been cooking since before you were born. I know what I'm doing. She shoved the rock solid Turkey in the oven. It'll defrost while it cooks. By noon, the smoke alarm was screaming because she forgot bread in the oven. The green beans looked like baby food because she left them boiling for an hour. She was trying to mash potatoes with a fork because she didn't own a masher. Why didn't you cut them smaller? Amy asked. This is how my mother did it! Linda screamed. I held up my phone. Can you repeat that? She launched another potato at me. The stuffing looked like red chunks floating in broth, like sad soup. We were starving, eating crackers from her pantry. When Nathan's cousin looked at the box. These expired in 2,019. Linda grabbed the box and threw it at him. They're still good at 5. The thermometer said the Turkey was done, but when Bill started carving it, Blood ran onto the platter. That's just Turkey juice, Linda insisted. He cut deeper, and it was still frozen in the middle. This could kill someone! She started sobbing. Why is this so hard? I couldn't help myself. Maybe some people just weren't taught how to cook growing up. She looked at me with pure hatred. Then she grabbed the Turkey platter and threw it in the trash. There. Are you happy now? I smiled sweetly. I sure am. Right on cue, the doorbell rang. The pizzas I had ordered arrived at the perfect time. While everyone was destroying the pizza, Linda said, I hate that you make everything look so easy. I took a big bite of pepperoni pizza and said, well, Linda, at least now everyone knows which one of us actually can't cook.

So I gave her a brutal reality check and told her I never wanted to see her again. I'm 110 pounds at 5 3. My sister 240 at 5 5. Yet somehow for the past 15 years, I'm the one she calls fat. It started when we were teenagers. She'd make comments about my chicken legs and how I looked sick. Then our parents always laughed it off as sibling rivalry. But it got worse over the years, not better. When I was a senior in high school, it got so bad I confided in my school counselor. She actually laughed in my face, said I was delusional and if I had body image issues, I needed to be put an award. After that, I just Learned to take it in silence. Yesterday, I visited my parents house for an extended family gathering. My aunts, uncles, cousins, everyone was there. I should have known what was coming. Within 10 minutes, my sister started. Look at how her thighs jiggle when she walks. She said it loud enough for everyone to hear. A few cousins snickered. I pretended not to notice and kept helping mom set the table. Then she pointed at me sitting down. Look at those stomach olds. Is that normal? I was fighting back tears, my hands shaking as I held my plate. But she wasn't done, not even close. My boyfriend had Just texted asking how things were going. I was about to reply when my sister leaned over my shoulder, saw his name on my screen and said it. The thing that broke me completely. How do you even have a boyfriend? Is he into whales or something? I mean, can he even find the hole with all that blubber? The entire room went quiet. My uncle stopped mid sentence. My mom froze with a serving spoon in her hand and I just sat there. Tears stream coming down my face, unable to move. That's when something inside me snapped. I stood up so fast my chair fell backwards. Fuck you, I screamed through tears. You weigh more than twice what I do. Your gut literally rests on your guys when you sit down and you're insulting me. My voice cracked, but I kept going. What kind of sister are you? I hate you. I fucking hate you. She looked around at everyone, stunned, her mouth hanging open. Then she recovered, crossing her arms. Excuse me. I am your sister. You will respect me. If not for me, you wouldn't even be alive right now. That line, that stupid line she always uses because she donated blood when I was sick as a kid. What do you get out of this? I was sobbing now, barely able to speak. What do you get out of humiliating me in front of everyone? She shrugged, actually shrug.

I started in the living room. The guys wrapped up the leather couch, gone. Coffee table with the marble top, gone. Both end tables, gone. Lamps, TV, entertainment center, speakers, even the damn throw pillows, all gone. Joanna's face started changing. Wait, you can't take the couch? Where are we supposed to sit? Should have thought about that before, I said. Moving to the dining room, the custom walnut table went next. Then all eight chairs, the China cabinet, the bar cart with all the glassware, every single wine glass, every play, every fork and knife. This is insane, Liam shouted. You're taking the dishes? What are we supposed to eat off of? Not my problem, I said. Heading to the kitchen, the refrigerator, mine, bought it last year. The microwave, the toaster, the blender, the stand mixer, every pot and pan, every utensil. I kept receipts for everything over the past five years and my lawyer had already verified it all. By 10:00am, the bedroom was empty. Bed frame, mattress, dressers, nightstands, even the curtain rods. Joanna started crying, but I wasn't done. Bathroom, gone. Every towel, the rainfall shower head I'd installed, the matching his and hers sinks I'd custom ordered. Office, gone. My desk, my computer, my bookshelves, every single book, even the washer and dryer from the garage. I'd bought those, too. By noon, the house was completely empty except for Joanna's clothes piled in the corner and Liam's beaten up futon he brought from His mom's basement six months ago. Oh, and a microwave his sister gave him in college that didn't even heat food evenly. They stood in that hollow shell of a house, their voices echoing off the bare walls, staring at the dust outlines where furniture used to be. You're a monster, Joanna whispered. No, I said walking toward the door. I'm just a guy who took it. Personal belongings, enjoy your fresh start. Last I heard from a mutual friend, they were eating takeout on the floor for three months before Liam's credit cards maxed out at IKEA. They broke up two months after that when Joanna realized a 24 year old temp worker couldn't actually afford the lifestyle she wanted. I'm in a new place now. Everything decorated exactly how I like it. Sometimes petty isn't wrong. It's just justice.

When I said I live in my car, he choked on his food. The silence that followed was deafening. Mom dropped her fork and it clattered against her plate. My younger brother stopped mid bite, staring at me like I just confessed to murder. Dad was coughing, reaching for his water glass, his face turning red. What do you mean you live in your car? Mom finally whispered. I've been dreading this moment for eight months. Every family dinner, every phone call, been carefully dodging questions about my living situation. When they asked about my place, I changed the subject to work. When they wondered about my neighborhood, I talked about the weather. dad had caught me off guard by mentioning rent costs in the city, assuming I was struggling like any normal 25 year old. The truth was more complicated than just being broke. I had a decent job at a tech startup, king, $65,000 a year. My bank account wasn't empty. I could afford rent, could have gotten a studio apartment months ago. The problem was my credit score completely destroyed by identity theft. Two years earlier, someone had opened 17 credit cards in my name, maxed them all out, then disappeared, leaving me with $80,000 in debt I never created. Fighting identity theft is like trying to prove a negative. Every apartment application got rejected within hours. Landlords would smile during tours and call later saying they'd gone with Someone else. Property management companies wouldn't even return my calls once they ran my credit check. I'd filled out 93 rental applications in four months, getting rejected by everyone from luxury high rises to basement apartments with no windows. My Honda became my bedroom by necessity, not choice. I'd invested in window tinting, a good sleeping bag and a gym membership for showers. I rotated between different parking spots, 24 hour Walmarts, quiet residential streets, hotel parking lots where I could blend in. I kept business clothes in my gym locker, maintained my professional appearance, never let my co workers know I was sleeping in the company parking garage. The irony was crushing. I was making more money than I'd ever earned, finally building a career in software development, but living like I was homeless because of crimes someone else committed. I'd spent thousands on lawyers, credit repair services, identity Protection, money that could have gone toward deposits and rent. Every month I'd check my credit report hoping for improvement, only to find new fraudulent accounts appearing. Dad was still coughing, processing what I'd said. But you have a job he managed. You're making good money. How are you living in your car? I explained the identity theft, the credit destruction, the endless rental rejections. Mom's face cycled through confusion.

I'm an interior coordinator, meaning I design and source furniture for a living. Everything in our house, say eight thousand dollar Italian leather couch, the custom walnut dining table worth twelve thousand dollars a hand woven Persian rugs. The art on the walls, I personally picked it out, negotiated the price and had it delivered. I spent years curating our home into something beautiful. My wife Joanna worked construction management, made decent money, around seventy five thousand dollars a year. But spent every single dime on herself. Designer handbags, spa day is girls, trips to Miami. Meanwhile, I was saving and investing every bonus into making our house a home. We've been married three years. When I caught her cheating with Liam. Some 24 year old temporary worker from her company found out when he accidentally called her phone while I was holding it. The idiot didn't even check who answered before saying, hey babe, I'm outside. When I confronted her, Joanna didn't even try to hide it. She actually had the audacity to move him into our guest room that same week while I was sleeping in the basement. She said I was being dramatic and that I should just accept that she'd evolved past our marriage. I filed for divorce the next morning. During the proceedings, her lawyer kept pushing for half of everything in the house. That's when I calmly pulled out my folder. The house was in my name only, purchased two years before we got married with money from my grandfather's inheritance. And every single piece of furniture, every appliance, every decoration, every dish. I had receipts showing they were bought with my income in my name for my business portfolio. My lawyer smiled when he saw Joanna's face drop. Her attorney tried arguing that gifts between spouses become marital property, but I documented everything as business assets for my interior design work. Completely legal and completely mine. Fine, Joanna sneered during our final meeting. Keep your ugly furniture. Liam already said we're going to Restoration Hardware and buying all new stuff anyway. Better taste than your boring minimalist crap. Liam nodded enthusiastically beside her, scrolling through furniture on his phone like a kid in a candy store. I just smiled and said, sounds great. I'll schedule the movers for next Tuesday. She actually laughed at me. Oh, sweetie, you're so petty. Taking your precious lamp and your sad little bookshelf. Go ahead. Moving day came. I showed up at 8:00am with a truck fucking four professional movers. Joanna and Liam were sitting on my eight thousand dollar couch drinking coffee from my 600 dollar espresso machine, looking completely relaxed. What are you doing here so early? Joanna asked, annoyed. Taking my personal belongings, I said, calmly, handing the crew There

I left with $12 and never looked back. Years later, they applied to the company I built from nothing. I hired them under fake names. When I was 17, I found out my $38,000 college fund, money my grandpa left me before he died was gone. My parents spent it on a kitchen renovation, granite countertops, custom cabinets, a farmhouse sink, the works. I came home from my shift at Dairy Queen to find them standing in their brand new kitchen beaming. Mom was running her hand along the marble backsplash. Flash. Isn't it beautiful, she said. I asked where they got the money. Dad didn't even look guilty. We used your college fund. You're smart. You'll figure something out. Besides, you can take out loans like everyone else. I remember staring at that kitchen, at the pendant lights that cost more than my car and feeling something inside me shut off completely. That was Grandpa's money, I said quietly. He left that for me. And where are your parents? Mom snapped. We needed this. The old kitchen was embarrassing. I moved out the next week with $12 in my pocket, two trash bags of clothes and my laptop on my friend Owen's couch for three months while working night shifts at a warehouse. No degree, no backup plan, no safety net, just anger I turned into fuel. I taught myself to code using free YouTube to tutorials spent every Break at work writing lines of code on my phone. I lived on dollar store ramen and gas station coffee. My first freelance client paid me $200 to build a website. I cried when the payment hit my account. By 19, I was making enough to rent a studio apartment with two other guys. By 22, I built a logistic software that helps small warehouses optimize their shipping routes. 25, I had 47 employees and an office in a building I used to walk past and dream about. I named the company Ashford Solutions, changed it twice over the years as we expanded, kept my personal life completely offline. No LinkedIn photo, no company headshots, nothing that connected me to my past. Then and eight years after I left, I got two applications for entry level data positions. Patricia and Glen Carmichael, my parents. I sat in my office staring at their resumes for 20 minutes straight. Dad's consulting firm had collapsed after some kind of embezzlement scandal with his part. Mom's Boutique went under when a bigger store opened nearby. According to their work histories, they've been unemployed for 7 months. They were applying everywhere, retail, call centers, admin work, anything they could get. They had no idea Ashford Solutions was mine. I built it under my middle name, never used family photos, never mention.

I met Arya at a wedding two years ago. We clicked instantly, started dating within weeks and got married last year. Everyone loved her except my best friend Kelly, who kept saying something felt off about her. I ignored him. After the wedding, her parents and I agreed to split her college tuition while she finished her marketing degree. I took on freelance work to cover my half, working nights and weekends. Money was tight, but I thought we were building something real. Kellen stayed in our circle. Game nights, beers after work, the usual stuff. He stopped making comments about area, so I figured everything was fine between in them. Last Friday, area went to her friend Chelsea's birthday party downtown. I had a work deadline, told her to have fun. She came home around 1:00am, immediately showered and passed out, saying she'd had too much wine. At 2:00am, her phone buzzed. Text from an unsaved number, but I recognized it. Helen's new number from when he switched carriers last month. Love tonight, babe. Can't wait for round two. You looked incredible. My stomach dropped. I grabbed her phone. No password because we have nothing to hide. I opened the conversation. Three messages total. His message, one from earlier. Meet me upstairs in 10. Her reply coming. I opened her group chat with her girlfriends. Videos, Everywhere. Aria and Kellen kissing in a bedroom. Her friends recording, laughing, calling me a walking ATM. One message from Aria. He's literally paying for my degree while I get what I actually want. LMAO. Another. Kellen's always been hotter. Just needed the stable guy first. I sat there for an hour while she slept. It clicked. They thought I was stupid. They were comfortable planning hookups while I paid bills. I forwarded everything to my email. Every message, every video. Deleted the sent messages from her phone. Put it back on the nightstand. Saturday morning, she left for her study group. I drove straight to her parents house. They're good people. Traditional church going. Always treated me like family. When I showed them the videos, her mom started crying. Her dad went silent with rage, paced the kitchen, then said, we raised her better than this. I'm so sorry. I asked for one favor. Don't tell her yet. Don't cut the tuition yet. Wait until tomorrow. Her dad looked confused, but nodded. What are you planning? Justice. Next? I

My HR director asked if I wanted to interview them. I said yes, but I didn't meet with them personally. I had my operations manager Claudia do it, told her to use a different email signature, made her look like the owner on paper. They were hired within a week. I gave them new company emails, put them on separate shifts so they wouldn't overlap much, routed all their communications through fake manager names I'd created. Dad worked mornings and data entry. Mom handled afternoon customer service calls. For six months, they worked for me without knowing. I'd walk past Dad's cubicle sometimes watching him squint at spreadsheets. I'd listen to recordings of Mom's calls, hearing her forced cheerfulness with customers. Every paycheck they deposited, I personally signed off on. I saw Dad's performance reviews mediocre. He complained about the work being beneath him. Mom got written up twice for being late. They were barely scraping by, just like I had. Then December came, company holiday party at a hotel ballroom downtown. Everyone was required to attend. I watched them walk in together wearing clothes that looked slightly too worn for the occasion. They grabbed drinks from the bar and stood awkwardly near the back. Halfway through dinner, I walked onto the stage to give the owners annual speech. The room went quiet. Mom saw me first. Her wine glass slipped from her hand and shattered on the floor. Dad's face went completely white. I Smiled and tapped the microphone. Good evening, everyone. For those who don't know me, I'm Wesley Carmichael, founder and CEO of Ashford Solutions. I let that sit for a moment. I wanna thank all of you for your hard work this year. Every single person in this room has contributed to our success, even those who didn't realize who they were working for. I looked directly at them, especially the ones who taught me that you can always figure something out, that you don't need a safety net, that granite countertops are more important than your kids future. Mom tried to leave, but the crowd was too thick. Thanks for applying, I said. You'll get your last checks next week. They were gone before dessert.

I asked for seconds. Stay 50. He gave me the final warning. One week left to prove myself, or we were done. He said it like he was doing me a favor, like I should be grateful. He was giving me extra time. I nodded and ordered Thai food delivery to his apartment. The next week, I came over and made this huge dinner at his place. Egg, mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables swimming in butter, fresh bread. He watched me eat it all in my oversized sweater and actually laughed this bitter, mean laugh. I think we both know this is over, he said. You've clearly gained weight instead of losing it. This is pathetic. I finished my plate and went home. The final day of his ultimatum arrived. He texted me that morning saying we were done, that I'd had my chance and failed spectacularly, that he'd given me every opportunity to change. I asked him to meet me at his apartment that evening. One final dinner together. He agreed, probably because he wanted to gloat one more time. I showed up that evening in a fitted black dress I'd bought the week before. His face went completely blank when he opened the door. The dress showed everything. My toned arms, my defined waist, my flat stomach. I'd lost 19 pounds and gained muscle in places I didn't even know I had muscles. He couldn't form words, just stared at me like I Was a stranger. But I watched you eat like a pig. I walked past him calmly. Every single meal. You watched me eat was calorie calculated. I ate precisely what I needed in front of you, then barely ate anything the rest of the day. His mouth hung open. Plus, I've been going to the gym every morning at five, two months straight. You never knew because you only saw me at dinner or on weekends when I wore baggy clothes. But why? I wanted to see what you'd do. I said I wanted to see if you'd support me, if you'd ask how I was feeling, if you'd care about anything other than my body. I turned toward the door. You failed. Every single day, you failed. And now we're done. He was about to say something. We're breaking up. Don't contact me. He didn't take it well. The texts started immediately. Desperate, pathetic. Three days later, his roommate called me. Listen, I need to tell you something. He said he had a bet with his friends. That if he could get you to lose weight, they'd pay him $500. He was going to dump you anyway once the two months were up. Sorry. I wasn't his girlfriend working on self improvement. I was his payday after all.

I rinsed it for 90 seconds while rotating it carefully under the water, inspecting every angle like I was looking for defects. If I saw the smallest potential missed spot, I would start all the way over from checking the water temperature. The whole performance took 15 minutes and created a line of seven increasingly amused co workers waiting to use the sink. Someone actually started clapping when I finished. Within a few days, people started bringing others over to watch and making bets on how long my routine would take. Later that week, Janet sent another email saying certain employees were abusing shared resources with unnecessary theatrical displays, and that she'd already spoken to management about it. I responded by bringing a small folding table the next morning to lay out my supplies, plus a digital timer that beeped loudly after each step. A couple days after that, my manager pulled me aside in the hallway and asked if everything was okay. I pulled out my phone and showed him Janet's original email. He read it, looked at me I deeply, and told me to just try not to take too long at the sink. That afternoon, Janet saw us talking and her expression went dark. By the second week, I was wiping down the counter, inspecting the soap bottle, applying hand sanitizer three separate times. Janet Stopped coming to the kitchen entirely when I was there, but I could see her watching me through the doorway every single morning with her jaw tight and her hands visibly shaking. On day 16, I was running the water to begin my routine. Janet came storming through the doorway and shoved past three people to get right in my face. You're a manipulative psychopath! She screamed. You're making a mockery of everything I said and wasting company resources to feed your own pathetic ego! I stood there calmly with my gloves on and asked her very quietly if she felt I wasn't taking contamination seriously enough. She ripped the mug from my hand and slammed it against the counter edge with shocking force. The crack echoed through the room and ceramic shards exploded across the floor. You disgusting plague rat! She screamed. You orchestrated this whole thing to humiliate me in front of everyone! Management is protecting you because they think it's funny watching me suffer. Nobody in this building has any respect for national standards anymore! Her whole body was shaking and the kitchen went dead silent, with at least 12 people standing frozen with their mouths open. One of the senior managers stepped forward and said in a calm voice that Janet needed to come with him to his office immediately. Janet's face drained of all colour when she looked around and realised how many people had just watched her complete meltdown. She glanced down at the Broken ceramic on the floor, then around at all the faces staring at her in shock and walked out without making eye contact with anyone. I picked up the two pieces of my mug and threw them away. Janet got a formal warning for destroying property and creating a hostile work environment. When she transferred to a different floor. I went back to rinsing my mug like a normal person.

So I showed everyone exactly how clean I could be. I opened my email and found a message from my co worker Janet with the subject line Kitchen Hygiene Emergency that she sent to everyone in the company including our C E O. She wrote that someone was contaminating the shared workspace and creating a biohazard that was putting the entire office at serious risk. And while she wouldn't name names, it was obvious who she meant. She formally requested that management ban this disease spreading monster from kitchen facilities until they Learned to act like a civilized monster. That morning I've been rinsing my single coffee mug in the sink for maybe 30 seconds. That was it. One mug, running water. Janet had transferred to our floor six months earlier and had quickly appointed herself the office police for everything from thermostat settings to proper email etiquette. But this was beyond anything she'd done before. She sat at her desk two rows over staring directly at me with her arms crossed and a tight little smile on her face while I read her email at mine. At that moment, I decided that if Janet wanted cleanliness, I would give her cleanliness she would never forget. I hit reply all and wrote the most theatrical apology email imaginable thanking Janet for bringing this critical crisis to everyone's attention and promising To be extremely careful from now on. I sent it and heard laughter echo through the office. The next morning, I arrived at the kitchen during peak coffee hour, carrying my mug along with dish soap, a scrub brush, rubber gloves and antibacterial spray. I snapped on the gloves like a surgeon prepping for a transplant. I turn on the faucet and let the water run for a full minute while testing the temperature with one gloved finger, adjusting it twice before nodding in satisfaction. I placed my mug under the stream and began scrubbing in slow, methodical circles while counting out loud.

I've been hosting every single holiday for my husband Nathan's family for five years straight. We're talking 14 people showing up at my house expecting miracles while his mom, Linda, parks herself in my kitchen watching me cook like she's Gordon Ramsay. Last month when I was preparing a family dinner, she followed me around the kitchen saying thing. It was like, that's not how my mother made gravy, but I guess your mother never taught you anything. Then she turned to Nathan's sister Amy and whispered loud enough for me to hear, I don't know why he married someone who can't even cook a proper meal. When we sat down to eat, Linda took one tiny bite of my perfectly roasted chicken, spit it into her napkin and announced to the whole table, this is completely dry. I feel bad for my son having to eat like this every night. Nathan just kept shoveling food in his face. Linda kept going, pushing her plate away. My mother would roll over in her grave seeing this pathetic attempt at a family dinner. That's when I set down my wine glass, smiled my sweetest smile and said, you know what, Linda, you're absolutely right. Why don't you show us how it's and make Thanksgiving This year? Everyone froze with their forks in the air. Nathan actually looked up from his plate for The first time, what? Linda's face went from smug to panic, but she covered it with this weird laugh. I suppose I could show you all how it's actually supposed to be done. She spent the rest of dinner going on about her mother's secret stuffing recipe and how she'd make everything from scratch. The week before Thanksgiving, Linda called me asking, how many pounds do you think the Turkey should be? Oh, Linda, I wouldn't know since I never Learned to cook properly, remember? She called again asking, what temperature do you cook it at? Gosh, Linda, I just guess since I don't actually know how to cook. The night before Thanksgiving, she called Pam making because she just remembered the Turkey needs to defrost. How long does that take? I said, someone with your expertise would know that and hung up. Thanksgiving morning, I rolled up to Linda's at 9 sharp with Starbucks. Linda answered the door already crying and still in her bathrobe. The 20 pound Turkey was sitting in her sink like a frozen bowling ball. It won't defrost, she screamed at Nathan, who was trying to help by chipping at it with a butter knife. When did you take it out? I asked. Sipping my latte this morning. Nobody told me it takes days.

I don't want to get in the middle of this, but she's planning to visit Trevor on Saturday. The silence was deafening. Trevor? Her ex Trevor. Richard had threatened to rearrange Trevor's face when they broke up. Yeah, she says she needs closure. What's the address? I gave it to him. We hung up. Saturday came. Jenna spent two hours getting ready. New lingerie. I saw the tags in the trash, fresh manicure, the works. I'll be back tomorrow morning. Thank you for being so understanding. Take your time. Get all the closure you need. She left at 6 p m. At 6:45, Richard texted, I'm here. At 7:23, my phone exploded. Jenna calling. I let it.

If I saw the smallest potential missed spot, I would start all the way over from checking the water temperature. The whole performance took 15 minutes and created a line of seven increasingly amused co workers waiting to use the sink. Someone actually started clapping when I finished. Within a few days, people started bringing others over to watch and making bets on how long my routine would take. Later that week, Janet sent another email saying certain employees were abusing shared resources with unnecessary theatrical displays, and that she'd already spoken to management about it. I responded by bringing a small folding table the next morning to lay out my supplies, plus a digital timer that beeped loudly after each step. A couple days after that, my manager pulled me aside in the hallway and asked if everything was okay. I pulled out my phone and showed him Janet's original email. He read it, looked at me, saw deeply, and told me to just try not to take too long at the sink. That afternoon, Janet saw us talking, and her expression went dark. By the second week, I was wiping down the counter, inspecting the soap bottle, and applying hand sanitizer three separate times. Janet stopped coming to the kitchen entirely when I was there, but I could see her watching me through the doorway every single morning with her jaw tight and her hands visibly shaking. On day 16, I was running the water to Begin my routine when Janet came storming through the doorway and shoved past three people to get right in my face. You're a manipulative psychopath! She screamed. You're making a mockery of everything I said and wasting company resources to feed your own pathetic ego! I stood there calmly with my gloves on and asked her very quietly if she felt I wasn't taking contamination seriously enough. She ripped the mug from my hand and slammed it against the counter edge with shocking force. The crack echoed through the room and ceramic shards exploded across the floor. You disgusting plague rat! She screamed. You orchestrated this whole thing to humiliate me in front of everyone! Management is protecting you because they think it's funny watching me suffer. Nobody in this building has any respect for professional standards anymore! Her whole body was shaking and the kitchen went dead silent, with at least 12 people standing frozen with their mouths open. One of the senior managers stepped forward and said in a calm voice that Janet needed to come with him to his office immediately. Janet's face drained of all colour when she looked around and realised how many people had just watched her complete meltdown. She glanced down at the broken ceramic on the floor, then around at all the faces staring at her in shock, and walked out without making eye contact with anyone. I picked up the two pieces of my mug and threw them away. Janet got A formal warning for destroying property and creating a hostile work environment. When she transferred to a different floor, I went back to rinsing my mug like a normal person.

A year later, she showed up at my door crying, saying she missed me. I told her, tell that to the son in law you chose over me. My older sister Vanessa showed up at 2:00am on a Tuesday, mascara streaking down her face. She was seven months pregnant and her boyfriend, Liam, had just walked out after another fight. They sat me down at the kitchen table like this was some kind of intervention. Tell people it's yours, mom said, not asked. Told I'm her younger brother. I was seventeen. What? Just until Liam comes back. Vanessa can't handle everyone judging her. You're family. This is what family does. Vanessa sat there nodding like this made perfect sense, twisting a tissue in her hands. Mom already had the whole story mapped out. We've been secretly dating for months. Nobody at school would question it. And once Liam grew up and came back, they'd quietly reveal the truth, clean and simple. Mom, that's insane. I'm not doing that. Don't be selfish right now. Selfish. I have three finals this week. Vanessa's life is falling apart and you're worried about tests. Mom's voice cracked. She needs you. We all need to protect her. I looked at Vanessa, my sister who used to give me rides to basketball practice, who taught me how to parallel park. She wouldn't even meet my eyes. No, I said, I'm not Lying for you. That's when Mom's whole face changed. The pleading disappeared. Then. You need to leave tonight. You're joking. Vanessa needs her room back. The baby needs space. I can't have you here undermining her during this. I live here. Not anymore. She stood up. Pack your things. You're making this harder than it needs to be. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I kept waiting for her to crack, to say she didn't mean it, but she just stood there with her arms crossed while Vanessa cried quietly into her tissue. I packed while they watched TV in the living room. Mom didn't even look up when I dragged my suitcase past her toward the door. Vanessa called out a week, I'm sorry, but didn't move from the couch. I crashed with my buddy Garrett that night. When I told his mom what happened, she didn't even hesitate. You stay as long as you need. The next two weeks were a blur. I took my finals running on energy drinks in spite, somehow pulled off straight B's. Garrett's mom helped me apply for scholarships, drove me to campus visits. I got into state with enough financial aid to make it work. Mom texted twice that summer, once asking if I was coming to Vanessa's baby shower, once saying we should talk. I left both on read. I didn't.

They thought they'd inherited everything, but they fainted when they found out the truth. My step brother Nolan and step sister Heather decided I wasn't family. The day our parents married, I, I was 12, they were 16 and 18. Started small, forgetting to tell me about dinner plans, family photos without me. By the time I was 15, I was officially uninvited from everything, Christmas, Thanksgiving, birthdays, all of it. I told my dad I was choosing to stay away, that I was upset about the marriage. He believed them because they were older, more convincing. When he had his stroke three years ago, they told the hospital I wasn't. Immediate family put themselves as the only contacts, the only ones allowed information. I found out he was in a coma from a neighbour two weeks after it happened. Drove straight to the hospital, but security stopped me. My name was on a restricted list. Nolan had told them I was a disturbed ex girlfriend who'd been stalking the family. I tried everything to see my father, called the hospital administrators, sent letters, even hired a lawyer with money I didn't have. Nolan and Heather had power of attorney, medical proxy, everything. They'd convinced my dad to sign papers before the stroke, told him it was just standard planning. I spent three years getting updates from a Nurse who felt bad for me, meeting her at coffee shops where she'd risk her job to tell me if he was stable. Meanwhile, Nolan and Heather played devoted children on social media, posted daily updates about their vigil, their sacrifice, how hard it was being the only family, started a fundraiser for his medical bills that raised $40,000. Never mentioned they'd already sold his house and emptied his savings, paying for their own debts while he lay unconscious. I worked three jobs trying to save money for legal fees to fight them every holiday alone while they posted family photos around his hospital bed. Six months ago, they started pressuring me to sign documents, said it would be easier for everyone if I formally gave up any claim to inheritance, promised if I signed, they'd add me to the visitor list. I almost did it just to see him one more time. But then.

I was drunk and stupid and I thought it was funny. But this is life and death, man. These guys aren't playing. I'm your brother. Please. I stared at my crutches, leaning against the couch, thought about the EMT's face when Bryce laughed, thought about that tweet With 300 likes, thought about the five days I'd spent alone in pain while my brother made jokes online. I opened my contacts, scrolled to his name and did something I'd never done before. I blocked him. Then I called my parents, told them everything, the accident, the phone call, the tweet, the 92 missed calls. My mom cried. My dad got very quiet. Then he said something that surprised me. We'll handle Bryce. You focus on healing and don't ever list him as your emergency contact again. Three weeks later, Jake showed me Bryce's Facebook. He posted a long rant about ungrateful siblings and family betrayal. The comments weren't sympathetic this time. Someone had screen shoted his Karma tweet and posted it underneath. The irony was apparently not lost on people.

The officers arrived while we were singing Happy Birthday. Two uniformed police and a woman in plain clothes carrying a badge and clipboard walked straight through our backyard gate, while my daughter Lily sat at the head of the picnic table with her hands folded in her lap. Wait! The singing stopped midverse. Seventeen children and their parents froze with cake forks halfway to their mouths. Natalie dropped the camera she'd been using to record the moment. The female officer, whose badge read Detective Walsh, walked directly to Lily and knelt beside her chair. You're the one who called. Lily nodded once, then pointed at me. That's my dad. He needs to be arrested. My hands went numb. The backyard spun. Every parent stared at me with identical expressions of horror and disgust. Miss Missus Pemberton grabbed her twins and started backing toward the gate. Mister Lou pulled out his phone and started recording. I opened my mouth to explain, to defend myself, to say anything that would make sense of what was happening. But nothing came out except a strangled sound that made me look even more guilty. Detective Walsh asked everyone except immediate family to leave, which triggered a mass exodus that felt like being abandoned during a house fire. Parents grabbed their children and ran, leaving behind wrapped presents and half eaten cake. Within 90 Seconds, our backyard went from Celebration to crime scene. Lily's best friend Sophie was physically carried away by her mother, who shot me a look that could have strip paint. Bounce house rental company guy unplugged his equipment and left without asking for payment. Natalie stood frozen by the cake table, her face completely white. Our son, river, who was six, started crying and asking why everyone was leaving his sister's party. Detective Walsh's partner, Officer Brennan, positioned himself between me and Lily, like I might lunge for her. I raised my hand slowly, trying to show I wasn't a threat. But the gesture made me look like I was surrendering, which maybe I was. Lily sat perfectly still in her birthday crown, watching me with an expression I'd never seen before. Not scared, not angry.

A month later, my grandma came to visit. Did you get the $10,000 I sent for your birthday? I said I only got $50. Then my grandma slammed the table and started screaming. I'm the middle kid, not the golden one, not the disaster, the background, the one who covers gas money, hands over tips. When things are tight. My brother Mason gets everything, new phone, graduation trip, business funds. My sister Ivy gets therapy and never complained about that. But my tips always ended up as co pays and parking money. I kept track on my phone, $25 gas, $40 appointment, $60 Mason emergency, $120. Will repay Friday. Friday never came. I stopped tracking at $2,380 because the total made me feel stupid. My grandma set up a trust for all three grandkids, college funds, first car and money for your 21st birthday. My parents handled the paperwork because grandma forgets passwords. On my 21st, I came home after a double shift, sheet cake on the counter. Dad pulled out a folded Bill and slid it across the table. Your grandma sent this for you, $50. 50, I said, mom. Smile tightened. Don't be ungrateful, Caleb. A month later, grandma came to visit. She took my hand. Honey, did you get the $10,000 I sent for your birthday? I only got $50. Grandma slammed her palm on the table. The forks rattled. What? She shouted. What did they give you? Mom's smile cracked. Dad looked at the ceiling. Grandma told me to come by the next afternoon. No, parents, bring your bank statements, bring anything they asked you to sign. I showed up with a folder. We sat at her kitchen table. Withdrawals labeled household reimbursement, transfers marked for Mason's business. A transfer two weeks before my birthday, $10,000 from the trust to a joint account with my name and my parents names. I'd never seen that account. My signature was on the form, but it wasn't mine. Is that your handwriting? No. She took a photo and called someone. And an hour later, my parents walked in. Mason followed. Where is Caleb's $10,000? Dad laughed. Mom, for the love of, where is Caleb's $10,000? Grandma cut him off. Mason shifted. It went to expenses. Whose expenses? Family. Dad said, we plan to make it right. Mom looked at me. Caleb, don't make a scene. You forged my signature. Mom flinched.

So I made sure she'd spend the rest of her life understanding what it felt like not to be considered a family. My daughter Maya came home when she was three days old. The hospital bracelet was still on her ankle when my mother arrived to meet her and immediately asked if we knew anything about her people. I thought she meant Maya's birth family. She meant her genetics. From that first day, my mother treated Maya like she was a beautiful accident that had landed in a family she didn't belong to. The comments started early and never stopped. When Maya was 7 and got straight A's on her report card, my mother called it impressive for her background. When Maya's soccer coach wanted to move her up to competitive play at 10, my mother told people my daughter had natural athleticism that must come from somewhere else entirely. By middle school, the implications became accusations. My mother started asking my appointed questions about whether she felt like she fit in, whether she ever wondered about people who looked like her, whether she understood that family was really about shared DNA. He'd mention it in passing to other relatives. Adoption is so noble, though I couldn't do it myself and watch for reactions in our family group chat, my mother began a pattern of sharing photos of my brother's biological children with captions like the Real grandchildren, followed by heart emojis. Nobody addressed it. When Maya turned 13, my mother started weaponizing her theories into public performance. At Maya's eighth grade graduation, my mother cornered the principal and said adoption agencies should scream for behavioral predispositions. At a family reunion when Maya was 14, my mother spent the entire evening telling relatives about the challenges of raising a child who isn't genetically yours, speaking about Maya as if she wasn't standing right there. Maya stopped eating at family events. She'd sit silently and wait for it to be over her plate untouched. Then came the will reading. My grandmother had died peacefully in her sleep, and the lawyer summoned the family to his office. He had my grandmother's will and also a sealed letter addressed specifically to my mother. The lawyer opened the will first, going through the estates and bequests methodically. Then he turned to my mother and said there was something personal she should know. He handed her the sealed envelope. My mother opened it slowly, confused. But as she read the first line, her breathing changed. The letter explained that my grandmother's first husband, my mother's biological father, was not actually her biological father at all. My grandmother had adopted him after infertility. The records had been sealed decades ago. The adoption was closed, and my grandmother had never told her. Because, in my grandmother's mind,

It's money, okay. We used it for the family. I stared at him. I'm the family. He looked away. Grandma folded her hands. Transfer the full $10,000 to Caleb today. Remove your names from any accounts with his. Stop. Stop using him as a co signer or piggy bank. Mom's voice turned sweet. Mom, you're confused. Grandma stood. I may forget my reading glasses, but I do not forget theft. I pushed my chair back. I'm done. I'm not signing anything. I'm not handing over tips. I'm not co signing. I'm not covering gas.

I muted them all. By the next afternoon, grandma had frozen my parents trust access for an audit and set up an account with only my name. I moved out within a month, found a room above a nail salon. I said no. To covering Mason's catering gig. I said no. To Ivy's Midnight Furniture moving, mom called from a different number. Your grandmother is turning you against us. No, you did that. We just needed help. Ask for help. Don't take it. Mason Dm'd me. Loan me 3K. Quick turnaround. I typed no, 12 messages came back. Selfish. You changed. I set my phone to only allow grandma's calls. Mom emailed a family meeting proposal with bullet points in the middle. Caleb will apologize for overreacting. I deleted it. I'm 22 now. I pay my own rent. I answer Grandma's calls on the first ring. When I see my parents at the store, we say hi like neighbors. Mason still asks for favors. I still say no. They never apologized. Not really. Just we were under stress and you know how your father is. I keep the $50 from my 21st birthday in my wallet, not as a wound, as a receipt. It reminds me what I used to accept and what I don't anymore.

The airbag dust was still settling when I heard the EMTs voice calling your emergency contact now. My phone was shattered on the passenger floor, screen cracked into a spider web. Through the ringing in my ears, I heard them dialed my older brother, the person I'd listed years ago. Without a second thought, his voice came through the speaker groggy and annoyed. Yeah, your brother's been in an accident. He's conscious but injured. We need you to meet us at County General. There was a pause, then laughter, actual laughter. That's what he gets for taking my parking spot this morning. The EMT's face went blank. Sir, this is serious. He needs family here. Bryce laughed again, harder this time. Nah, I'm good. He'll figure it out. He always does. Then he hung up. The EMT looked at me with something like pity. Got anyone else we can call? I gave them my best friend's number. Jake was there in 20 minutes. Bryce never showed. Broken leg, fractured wrist, three cracked ribs, mild concussion. The doctor said I was lucky. Six weeks minimum before I could walk without crutches, probably longer before I'd be back to normal. Jake helped me home, set me up on The couch, grabbed my prescriptions. You should call your parents, he said gently. Let them know what Bryce did. I thought about it. Then I checked Twitter. Bryce had posted four hours after the accident, Karma's real, y'all. Some people really gotta learn the hard way. The replies were full of laughing emojis, people asking what happened. Bryce playing it mysterious, dropping hints about family drama and people who deserved what they got. My chest felt hollow. This wasn't sibling rivalry. This was something colder. I didn't call my.

So I started dating her boyfriend's ex and now we're about to get married. I'm 49 and my ex wife Karen is 50. We were married for 22 years before everything fell apart. The final straw came on our anniversary when I came home with a present for her. I'd saved up for months to buy her this Tiffany necklace she'd been eyeing every time we walked past the. The second I handed her the box, she didn't even look at it, just accused me of buying it for whoever I was sleeping with and threw it straight in the trash. Wouldn't even open it to see what was inside. I talked to a divorce attorney the next week. We filed within a month and she moved out immediately. My attorney wanted to know where she went because Karen refused to list her new address on any paperwork. Turns out she moved in with her boyfriend, Jeremy. And yeah, I knew Jeremy. Our oldest kids have been in the same class since pre. Okay. I also knew Jeremy's wife, Taylor. They just gotten divorced right before us, which suddenly made a lot more sense. The divorce took over a year to finalize because Karen couldn't agree to any terms. A few weeks after it was done, Karen and Jeremy went public with their relationship on some luxury beach trip, photos everywhere acting like they'd won The lottery. That's when Taylor sent me a friend request. I accepted immediately and she messaged me right after asking if I'd seen the post. We made small talk. Then she asked if I wanted to grab dinner and drinks. It was Karen's first weekend with the kids, so Taylor and I went out. I'm not exaggerating when I say I knew that night this could be something real. She actually looked at me when I talked. We agreed on almost everything. For the first time in years, I didn't feel like I was walking on eggshells. After dinner, I invited her over for more drinks and we watched some sappy romance movie making fun of how unrealistic it was. We finished a bottle and a half of wine, so I invited her to stay. She offered to take the couch, but I told her to take the bed since I still wasn't used to sleeping alone. Anyway, next morning, I made us breakfast. We agreed we should do this again. Then Karen texted that she was down the road to drop the kids off. Taylor rushed to get dressed and left through the back. It felt terrible making her sneak out like that. Of course, the first thing Karen asked was if she'd seen Taylor's car coming down our road. I said no. That was four years ago. Shortly after, Taylor admitted she wanted a relationship. And I said yes immediately. We kept it.

The electrical shut off in the southwest corner that kills lights but keeps the mom's life. The maintenance tunnel that runs under the loading dock. Every single detail I'd embedded as insurance.

Armed guys outside scanning. Went around back industrial lot, chain link fence I'd personally cut a hole in eight months ago during surveillance.

I texted Vega, kill your radios, count to 30, then move to northwest corner inside, near the old freight elevator. I'll get you out. No reply. Just read 11:58 p m. I crawled through the tunnel, came up inside the building through a floor grate in the electrical room. At exactly 0:00 12, I cut the main breaker. Total darkness. Chaos erupted. Shouting, confusion. Vega and his team moved exactly where I told them. I covered from the shadows, directed them through the tunnel. No shots fired from my end. Didn't need to. All six officers out in four minutes. Morrison showed up 10 minutes later. Tactical vest, video, trying to look in charge. He saw me standing by my car, walked over, extended his hand. Garrett, thank god you saved. I looked at his hand. Didn't move. Send the invoice to the city. My consulting rate is $5,000 an hour. His face dropped. Garrett, come on. Don't be like that. You said I wasn't police anymore. So treat me like a contractor. I just worked three hours. That's $15,000. That's insane. So is calling a guy you fired and expecting free labor. I got in my car. Invoice arrives Monday. Morrison tried blocking payment. Called it unreasonable rates for civilian assistance. I sent the city attorney my recordings. Every call, every text. Morrison's personal request, Vega's Mayday. The check cleared two weeks later. $15,000. Morrison got demoted, laterally transferred to some desk job in records. Vega called. You really charged them every cent. He laughed. Respect. Last month, I got a text from the new chief. We're hiring. Interested? I replied. My rate just doubled. They paid it. I start Monday.

So I invited her to the birthday party. My daughter Josie is 8 years old and the sweetest kid you'll ever meet. She's the type who writes thank you notes without being asked, shares her lunch with kids who forget theirs and cries during those sad animal alter commercials. This year, she wanted a small birthday party at our house, just her closest friends and some backyard games. Nothing fancy, just the kind of simple Celebration where kids can be kids. At the start of the school year, Josie came home crying. A girl named Becky had spent the entire recess telling everyone that Josie's family was poor because we drive an old car. Becky told the other kids that Josie's clothes looked like they came from the trash and so our entire family is trash, that nobody should be friends with her. I held my daughter while she sobbed into my shoulder and I felt that mama bear rage building in my chest. The next day it got worse. Becky knocked Josie's lunch tray out of her hands in the cafeteria, the food splattering everywhere while other kids laughed. Josie had to eat the school's backup peanut butter sandwich in the bathroom because she was too embarrassed to go back. Then Becky started tripping her in gym class, making it look like accidents. The gym teacher never saw it happen, but Josie came home with bruised knees. Three Days in a. By the end of the week, Becky was spreading rumors that Josie cheated on tests, that she picked her nose when no one was looking, that she still wore pull UPS at night. I called the school principal and demanded a meeting, said they'd look into it, but explained that Becky's mom was on the PTA board and a major donor to the school, so they needed to handle it delicately. My daughter was being tormented and they wanted to handle it delicately. Josie stopped wanting to go to school. She'd start crying on Sunday nights just thinking about Monday morning. She'd fake stomach aches and headaches, begging me to let me stay home. I watched my happy, confident little girl shrink into someone who was afraid of her own shadow. Then one afternoon, Josie came to me with the most unexpected request. She asked if Becky could come to her birthday party. I thought she was joking. She wasn't. I asked her why on earth she'd want to.

My husband Malcolm has an identical twin, Dave. And for five years, he was basically my best friend. We had this running joke where he'd introduce me as the sister I actually like at parties, text memes all day, grab coffee every week, and he was the first person I text with good news. My husband Malcolm used to joke that Dave loved me more than him. For two years, getting pregnant was all anyone talked about. Malcolm's mom would call weekly asking if we'd had any luck. My mom sent fertility supplements and prayer cards. Even Dave would joke about being the fun uncle who'd spoil our kids rotten. After a year of trying, we saw specialists. The diagnosis hit hard. Malcolm had severe fertility issues, and I had what they called a hostile uterus. The doctor literally said we had a 10% chance, maybe less. I cried in the parking lot while Malcolm held me. Dave showed up that night with Chinese food and stupid comedy specials, staying until we laughed again. The whole family rallied around us. Malcolm's parents offered to pay for IVF. My sister researched adoption agencies. Dave drove me to appointments when Malcolm couldn't leave work. Everyone so invested, so supportive. Like our fertility struggle was this group project we'd all figure out together. Then, miracle of miracles, I got pregnant. I found out On a random Tuesday morning, the test showed two lines so faint I thought I was imagining them. Three more tests confirmed it. When we told the family at Sunday dinner, Malcolm's mom actually screamed. My mom cried. Everyone hugged us, toasted with champagne while I held apple juice. Dave was there smiling, but something felt off. He congratulated us, gave me a quick hug, then spent the rest of dinner on his phone. That was the last normal interaction we had. Next week, Dave bailed on our coffee date. Said he had a work thing. The week after that, he missed family dinner. Stomach bug. Then Malcolm's birthday party. Car trouble, my birthday dinner, another work emergency. This was the guy who once drove two hours in a snowstorm just to bring me soup when I had the flu.

Then I saw a text that made me call the police. I'd known Valerie for eight years. She'd always been intense. But lately something felt really off. She'd blow up my phone with 10 texts in a row if I didn't respond within minutes. Six weeks ago, she called me with this manic energy in her voice. I met someone. You have to meet him, please. I agreed. We met at a coffee shop the next day with her boyfriend, Trevor. 20 minutes into our conversation, Valerie grabbed both our hands across the table and squeezed hard. I think the three of us should be together, I laughed nervously. Wait, what? Valerie's face was completely serious. She squeezed harder until it hurt. I'm serious. The three of us. It's meant to be. My brain couldn't process this. This was my best friend. Trevor's polyamorous. You're what's been missing from my life. You have to say yes. I yanked my hand away. Val, I love you as a friend. That's it. I'm not interested. Her face went blank like she was a different person. Just think about it. I could barely speak. There's nothing to think about. She stood up. You'll change your mind. That night at midnight, my phone lit up. Have you thought about it? I felt sick. The next morning, three more texts. I know you're scared, but we're perfect together. This is fate. I typed back, shaking that I Already said, no, please stop. She responded instantly, you don't mean that. Then came the articles about polyamory, voice messages explaining why we belong together. My phone wouldn't stop buzzing. Then one night someone knocked. I opened it and Valerie was there with Trevor and her face scared me. Can we please just talk about this? She pushed past me into my apartment. I felt panicked. She sat on my couch and ignored everything I've been saying. For 20 minutes, she talked about destiny and soulmates. When I got them to leave, she hugged me too long and whispered in my ear, I'll wait for you to come around. She came back the next day and knocked for 10 minutes. I watched through the people. The day after that, more knocking. I felt trapped. Then my friend Casey texted asking if Val's news was true. I went pale. Valerie was telling people I'd agreed. I had to explain she was lying. That's when Trevor started texting.

So I called them myself and found out the truth. Mrs. Connie was my guidance counselor. In February of senior year, she called me into her office about a scholarship, full ride to any college made for low income students who would be the first in their family to go to college. I worked two jobs helping my mom pay her medical bills and we were barely keeping up. She handed me the packet with this huge, huge smile. You're exactly who they're looking for. This has your name written all over it. I worked on that application for weeks and poured everything into my essay. When I finally gave everything to her, she promised she'd look it over and send it in. Three days later, she called me back to her office, but the energy was completely different. She kept glancing at her computer screen and wouldn't look at me. I'm so sorry, but when I was reviewing your application, I noticed you didn't meet the GPA requirement. I had to Mark you as an eligible. My throat got tight. Wait, what? I have a 3.8 and the requirement is 3.5. She waved her hand dismissively. I double checked their internal guidelines. There's nothing I can do. Her tone was so final, like she wanted me out of her office. I left feeling completely crushed. That scholarship wasn't just about college anymore. It was about my mom not having To choose between her medication and groceries. Without it, I'd be stuck working two jobs forever while she got sicker. In April, the school held an assembly for scholarship announcements and I almost skipped when they called out that same scholarship. I felt my chest get tight. And then they announced the winner, Olivia. My head snapped up. Olivia walked on stage wearing clothes that probably cost more than my mom's hospital bills with this huge smile on her face. And her parents were in the back literally sobbing with pride. I just sat there trying to make sense of it because Olivia's family was loaded. Her dad owned multiple businesses. They had a huge house and she drove a brand new car to school every day. This scholarship was specifically for low income, first generation students. And Olivia was neither of those things. After the assembly, I went straight home and pulled up the scholarship website. I read through all the requirements and confirmed that Olivia's family made way over the income limit and both her parents had college degrees. Then I saw at the bottom that they only gave out one scholarship for school each year.

She asked how Roger was enjoying retirement. I said he wasn't retired. He left for work every morning at 7:30. She looked confused and said they laid him off during company downsizing in 2022. I stood there holding a calculator because I was trying to keep our groceries under $60. Meanwhile, Roger had been sitting on his dead parents money this whole time. For two years I've been clipping coupons, shopping sales, telling our kids we couldn't afford new school shoes yet. I work double shifts at the nursing home, picked up weekend hours cleaning offices. Sold my grandmother's jewellery to cover our son's dental work. Roger would come home at 5:30 every day, complaining about his boss, talking about difficult clients, even brought home fake paperwork. Sometimes he'd give me his paycheck every two weeks, always just enough to cover basic bills, sometimes less because of reduced hours or equipment costs or mandatory unpaid training. I'd skip meals so the kids could eat. Wore the same three scrubs on rotation for two years because new ones cost too much. Cancelled my doctor appointments because the co pays were $40. Our Daughter quit dance class. Our son couldn't join travel baseball. I told them daddy worked hard, but money was tight. He never complained. Meanwhile, Roger's parents had died three years ago and left him everything. The house, the investments, the savings accounts. He told me they'd left some small bonds that wouldn't mature for decades. After talking to his coworker, I drove straight to his parents Old House, found his car parked in the driveway. He was inside watching television on a 70 inch screen I'd never seen before. The place was fully furnished. Renovated kitchen, new appliances.

She was wearing the dress I bought her for our anniversary, the one she'd said was too nice for regular wear. Kyle was eating a sandwich she'd made, cut diagonally the way she knew I liked but never did for me anymore. They jumped apart when I walked in. Lisa said Kyle had fixed the garbage disposal. I checked later. It had never been broken. Started coming home at random times, always found evidence Kyle had just left fresh Cologne smell two coffee cups, his favorite snacks, in our pantry. Lisa got angry, said I was becoming paranoid and controlling, that Kyle was family and I was treating him like a threat.

Nice watch he picked out. Lisa gushed about how thoughtful he was, how he always remembered important dates. That's when I told them both I got an promotion, big one, senior management, double my salary. Lisa's face lit up for the first time in months, started talking about houses we could buy, vacations we could take, how proud she was. Kyle went quiet. Then he told us his news. He'd been fired three weeks ago. His company discovered he'd Been stealing client funds, small amounts over years. His house was being foreclosed. His car was getting repossessed. He needed to move back with our parents, but they said no. Lisa's face went through 17 expressions. Asked him to repeat himself, he explained he'd been using the money to fund his lifestyle, that his promotion had been fake, just a title he'd given himself. The expensive clothes, the house, the car, all built on theft. He was looking at prison time. Lisa turned to me and asked about my promotion details. When I started explaining, Kyle interrupted to ask if we had room for him to stay. Lisa said absolutely not. Kyle reminded her of all the times he helped her, all the repairs, all the favors. She said those weren't favors if he was using them to case our house for things to steal. He insisted he'd never steal from family. She, he laughed, said stealing from strangers wasn't better. Kyle looked at me for support, but I was busy watching my wife realize she'd spent five years worshipping a fraud. She asked him to leave when he was gone. She tried to apologize. I told her I needed space to think about our marriage. She said that was fair, but asked about the promotion money first. Some prizes aren't consolation, after all.

I gave them both a night they'd never forget. On our ten year anniversary, Reese handed me a beautifully wrapped box of perfume as a gift at dinner. It took me back because he knew strong sense made me dizzy and nauseous, but still, the perfume was classy and in small amounts, smelled great, so I was thankful. Until later that night, while he was in the shower, his phone lit up. It was a text from a woman named Maxine. Oh, Reese, you're so naughty, followed by the shy monkey emoji. Excuse me. What? I immediately unlocked his phone and saw exactly what she was referring to. Just 20 minutes ago, Reese had texted her, I got my wife your perfume so I can smell you around the house. My stomach turned. I read it three more times to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding, but it was still there, clear as day, along with dirty texts and pictures even I've never received. I felt my heart physically breaking as I read through parts where they mocked me, calling me easy to manipulate, how my husband wanted to be with her so bad, but the thrill of not getting caught was too exciting to just leave me. I glanced at the perfume bottle on the nightstand with tears in my eyes and decided then and there if they wanted a Thrill they were going to get it because perfume was flammable. First I had to drive Reese crazy. The next morning, I put some of the perfume on, just a tiny spray on my wrists and neck. His face lit up instantly. You're actually wearing it?

I'd ask when planning dinner dates. I was thinking of having lunch at Julio's Cafe. Reese's Coffee dripped out of his mouth every time. Never. Uh. I've never heard of those. He lied in his seat. The next day, I brought him a pamphlet. I was thinking of getting my nails done at the salon downtown. What do you think this was? Maxine's workplace? He stared at me with sweat beating down his forehead, studying my face to see if I knew. You've never liked the way they do nails? Would you really go there? He asked, testing me back. I shrugged. Maybe one day, but not today. He sighed in relief. But then came the really fun part. We were at his parents'house for dinner. I was wearing the perfume he'd given me.

She was accusing me of hurting her kids, saying I caused this, that we were monsters for parking in our own driveway. The other kid, to his credit, immediately told his mom that wasn't true. He said his brother wasn't paying attention and rode right into the truck. But she wasn't listening. My wife came outside to see what the motion was about. That's when the neighbor really lost it. She got right in my wife's face and said, you're going to regret this. You're going to pay for what you did. We tried to explain that their kid shouldn't have been on our property in the first place, but she stormed off, taking both kids with her. That night around 8, the dad showed up at our door. He was calmer than his wife, but equally insistent. He said we were responsible for their son's medical bills. He'd fractured his wrist and needed stitch is on his chin. I told him we weren't responsible and that his kids had been repeatedly told not to play on our property. He said that didn't matter in his mind. We created a dangerous situation by parking in our own driveway. The next morning we pulled up. All our security footage clearly showed me telling the kids To leave. The angle didn't catch the actual collision, but it picked up the audio of the crash and critically, the other kid telling his mom exactly what happened. We called our homeowners insurance and sent them everything, the certified letter receipt, the video footage, time stamps of every interaction. Our agent reviewed it and said if the neighbors try to file a claim, they'll fight it aggressively. He also suggested we file a police report. Went to the police station that afternoon. The officer who took our report looked at the evidence and said we had a solid case for harassment and trespassing. He said the neighbors were trying to intimidate us into paying. Yesterday, I contacted a lawyer. After reviewing everything, he said we should flip this situation. Instead of waiting for them to sue us, we're suing them for trespassing, harassment and property damage from all the holes their kids done. This morning they were served. They wanted me to pay medical bills for an injury that happened on my property after I'd warned them four separate times to stay away. Now they're paying legal fees and I'm filing a counter suit for every cent this has cost us.

Dad, I've been carrying this family financially for years while you all acted like I didn't exist unless you needed something. I'm not sabotaging you. I'm just done being used. We never used you. Really? When's the last time any of you asked how I was doing? When's the last time you invited me somewhere that didn't involve me paying for something or fixing something? Silence. That's what I thought. I said, don't call me again unless you're ready to apologize. I hung up and blocked all their numbers. For three days, my phone stayed quiet. It was the most peaceful three days I'd had in years. Then on January 4th, someone knocked on my apartment door. I looked through the people. Brielle. She wasn't dressed in her usual designer outfit, just jeans and a plain Sweater, no makeup, she looked tired. I opened the door but didn't invite her in. Can we talk? She asked quietly. Depends you here to yell at me, too? She shook her head no. I'm here to say you were right. We took advantage of you. I took advantage of you. I crossed my arms. Wait, I didn't realize how bad it was until you cut us off. She continued. Mom and dad have been freaking out trying to figure out their bills. Liam had to borrow money from his girlfriend to get his car back. And I, she paused, looking at her feet. I had to actually look at my bank account for the first time in months. Turns out I've been spending way more than I make because I always knew you'd cover the insurance. And, and I'm sorry, really sorry. Not because I need your money back, but because I didn't see you. I saw an ATM. I stood there for a moment, studying her face. She looked genuine, but I'd seen this act before. I appreciate you saying that, I said, finally, but I'm not turning the insurance back on. I know. I'm not asking you to. Good. She nodded, then turned to leave. At the stairs, she stopped. For what it's worth, I told mom she was wrong. She won't admit it, but she knows it, too. I closed the door without responding. Two weeks later, mom sent a Venmo request, $200, the note said. Your share of Christmas gifts. I declined it. And finally blocked her, too.

I figured out which twin liked to be swaddled tight and which one hated it. I got maybe three hours of sleep a night total. Then one Tuesday, he left for work and didn't come back. I called him around dinner, nothing. Called again at bedtime, straight to voicemail. I thought maybe he got in an accident. At midnight, I get a text, I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry. That's it. No explanation, no address. I called his mom and she said she hadn't heard from him. I called his job the next day and they said he quit that morning without notice. He just left, left me with 3, 6 month olds. I had a full breakdown in the bathroom while the babies napped. I called my sister and she said to call CPS, let them take the twins. I couldn't. I've been taking care of them for months. They knew my voice. They smiled when they saw me. So I figured it out. I got a job at a daycare that let me bring all three kids for free. I applied for WIC and food stamps. I moved us into a cheaper apartment with my friend Jamie, who needed a roommate anyway. I bought everything secondhand. I ate ramen most nights so I could afford the good formula for the twin with the sensitive stomach. It sucked. I'm not gonna lie. There were days I Sat in my car in the daycare parking lot and just cried before going in. But the kids were healthy. They were happy. When my daughter turned 3, the twins were talking and walking and calling me Mama. That's when he showed up, just knocked on the door one Saturday like nothing happened, that he'd been in therapy and wanted to be in their lives again. He brought toys, had this whole speech prepared about being a better man. My daughter hid behind me. The twins didn't even recognize him. He tried to pick one of them up and she started crying. I told him no. He said he had rights. I said he gave those up when he abandoned his kids for two years. He threatened to get a lawyer. I told him to go ahead because I had two years of records showing I did everything alone while he was gone. He left, tried coming back a few more times, but I stopped answering. Eventually, he gave up.

Two weeks after I had my daughter. I'm sitting on the couch trying to figure out why she won't stop crying, and my husband walks in looking like he's about to puke. He sits down, won't look at me, and says, I need to tell you something. I'm thinking maybe he lost his job or crashed the car. Nope. He tells me he got another woman pregnant. Not just pregnant. She had twins. And she died two days after giving birth. Some kind of bleeding thing that happened too fast for the doctors to stop. The babies are at the hospital right now. No family to take them. Just him. I straight up laughed, like the kind of laugh you do when something is so messed up your brain can't process it. Then I started crying. Then I threw a bottle at him, missed, hit the wall. My daughter screamed louder. He kept saying, I know this is bad, but they're mine. They don't have anyone. And I'm like, neither do I, apparently. I told him to get out. He left. I thought that was it. But the next morning, he shows up again with the social worker lady, and she's talking about temporary custody and emergency placement. And I realize he's serious. He actually expects me to do this. I went to the hospital with him. I don't even know why. Maybe I wanted to see if this was Real. The twins were in the NICU, hooked up to wires and tubes. They were so small. One of them had this tiny birthmark on her cheek. The nurse said they were doing okay, but needed another week of monitoring. I didn't agree to anything, but when they got discharged, he brought them to our apartment. Three babies. I had three babies, and I'd only given birth to one of them. The first month, I barely slept. My daughter had colic. One of the twins had reflux and would choke on her formula. The other one screamed every time you put him down. I was changing diapers every hour, heating up bottles in the middle of the night. And my husband kept saying he had to work extra shifts to pay for everything. Except he wasn't working. He was just gone. I'd ask him to pick up diapers, and he'd come home six hours later with the wrong size. I'd ask him to hold one baby while I fed the other two, and he'd suddenly have to take a phone call. One night, all three of them were crying at the same time, and I found him asleep on the couch with headphones on. By month four, I stopped expecting anything from him. I did it all myself.

So instead of paying, I sue them for trespassing. We bought our house last year. The moment we first viewed it, we noticed something odd, like scattered across the driveway, toys everywhere, and the side yard look like a construction site with random holes dug into the dirt. We figured the previous owners had kids. At our final walkthrough before signing, we showed up to find three kids in our driveway, drawing with sidewalk chalk and riding scooters. We introduced ourselves and asked where they lived. They pointed to the house next door. After the walkthrough, my wife and I walked over to introduce ourselves to their parents. We mentioned we were buying the house and with moving trucks coming in and out, it wasn't safe for the kids to be playing in our driveway. The parents seemed understanding. They nodded and said they'd keep the kids on their own property. Move in. Day came and went without incident. The kids stayed away from the driveway, which was great. But within a week, the toys reappeared in our side yard. We'd come home from work to find bikes lying in our grass and fresh holes dug everywhere. We went over and politely asked them to have the kids clean, clean up the toys, and stop digging. The mother actually laughed and said the previous owners always let the kids Try to dig for fossils in the yard. I said, well, we're the new owners, and we don't want the kids playing or digging in our yard. She gave us this look like we were being unreasonable, but she agreed. Two weeks later, the bikes were back in our driveway. Our security cameras picked up the kids riding around doing tricks and drawing elaborate chalk murals all over the concrete. We went back to the neighbor's house. This time we were more direct. No kids in our driveway, our yard, or drawing on our property. The neighbor did that thing where she sighed dramatically and said, the previous owners never had a problem with it. I replied, we're not the previous owners. This is our property now. My wife suggested we put it in writing, so we sent a certified letter clearly stating the kids were not permitted on our property for any reason. We got the signed receipt back. Legal proof we'd warned them. For about three weeks, things were quiet. Then last Sunday, I was in the garage working on some projects. Pulled my truck out into the driveway so I'd have more room to work. About 20 minutes in, I heard the familiar sound of kids laughing. I walked out to see two of them riding bikes in circles on our driveway. I told them, guys, you can't ride your bikes here. Please go home. They looked at me, didn't say anything, and slowly started riding toward Their house. Not even five minutes later, I heard them again. Then a scream. I dropped my tools and ran out.

We don't want your attitude, she said. My sister added, you think you're better than us. I smiled, logged into my account and paused their car insurance. The next morning, my brother called after getting pulled over. I stared at my phone reading Mom's text for the third time. Stay home this year. Your attitude ruins everything. My sister Brielle chimed in on the group chat. Honestly, you act like you're too good for us now. Too good for them. That's rich. I'd spent six years paying their car insurance, all three of them, Mom, Dad and Brielle. It started when dad lost his job back in 2018. Just temporary, he'd said, just until I get back on my feet. Dad got back on his feet two years ago. The insurance was still in my name. I pulled up the insurance portal on my laptop. My finger hovered over the mouse for maybe three seconds. Then I clicked paused all three policies. Effective immediately, the confirmation email popped up. I took a screenshot and saved it to a folder labeled receipts. New Year's Eve came and went. I spent it alone watching movies with my cat, drinking the expensive wine I would have brought to their house. Around 9:00am on January 1st, my phone started buzzing. Brielle, what the hell did you do, mom? This isn't funny. Cassidy. Then Liam called. My brother's voice was shaking with rage. Dude, I just got Pulled over on Route 9. The cop ran my plates and said my insurance is invalid. They're towing my car right now. What did you do? I could hear him arguing with someone in the background. Tow truck driver probably. That's weird, I said, keeping my voice light. Maybe you should have been paying your own insurance like an adult, you vindictive psycho. Do you have any idea how much this is going to cost me? The tow, the impound? $450 in towing and impound fees. I interrupted. Plus whatever ticket you're getting for driving uninsured. Yeah, I know. I looked it up last night. The line went silent for a solid five seconds. Why? He finally asked. And for the first time, he didn't sound angry. He sounded confused, like he genuinely couldn't understand why I do this. That almost made me laugh. You really don't get it, do you? I said, six years, Liam. Six years. I paid for all of you. And the one time I asked to spend a holiday with my own family, mom tells me to stay home, says I ruin.

Photos of champagne, fishing, poker. Victor wearing a crown that said birth. They king. My birthday was two weeks later. I cleared my schedule, didn't make plans just in case. At one PM, mom texted, stop by when you're free today. No. Happy birthday. I arrived at 3. Victor was on the couch, dad mowing the lawn, mom in the kitchen. She smiled. Oh, hey, Leo. You made it. She pulled a grocery store cupcake from the fridge. Chocolate base, white icing, no candle, then handed me a card inside. Maybe next year. That was it. I laughed from shock. This is it? Don't be so sensitive, Leo. You're an adult. We figured you didn't need a big Celebration. They didn't even look up from his phone the entire time. Like I wasn't even there. Victor got a weekend retreat with a private chef. Victor's been through a hard time. You're so private, we didn't think you'd want to fuss. I watched the cupcake sweat under fluorescent lights. It. It's not about a fuss. It's about the difference. She Rolled her eyes. This is exactly why we didn't plan anything. You always make everything about you. I pulled out my phone and photographed the cupcake next to the card. Thanks. Then I left. I booked a flight to Lisbon for the next morning. That night, dad texted, where did you go? I didn't respond. Dead. I posted from the airport lounge. Boarding pass visible. Birthday retreat. No chef required. Victor liked it. Mom viewed my story. Ten minutes later, she called. I silenced it. Another call. Text. Leo, this isn't funny. Call me. I wasn't trying to be funny. Messages escalated over the next days. You're in Portugal? Is this a work trip? The card was supposed to be funny then. Mom, you always act like we treat you horribly, but you never say what you want. Maybe if you spoke up, things would be different. Day five.

All projects backed up because everyone was ensuring quality for their full allocated time. The situation finally exploded three weeks in when Kilmar Industries called Callahan directly. I could hear him through his office door trying to explain why their quarterly report was too weeks late. It's almost done. We're just ensuring the highest quality, he kept saying. After he hung up, he came out to check on Nora's progress. She showed him her screen. The report had been sitting completed in her drafts for 10 days with four days left on her allocated time. His face went from confused to pale as the reality hit him. Why haven't you submitted it? Submit it now, he barked. Nora shook her head calmly. You said if I submit before the allocated time is up, I'm not doing quality work. Callahan's eye twitched as he looked around the office, finally seeing what had been happening. Many projects are sitting in drafts right now. Milo pulled up a spreadsheet he'd been maintaining, 25 completed projects all waiting for their allocated time to expire. Callahan's hands shook as he grabbed the edge of Milo's desk. This is insane. Our clients are furious. Submit everything. Immediately, Colby leaned back in his chair. But you said quality work takes time. We're following your policy to the, you know this isn't what I meant, Callahan's voice cracked. You're deliberately sabotaging the company. I stood up slowly. We're doing exactly what you told us to do. His face turned purple as he looked at all of us sitting calmly at our desks with completed work hidden away. If you don't start submitting projects right now, you're all fired. The room went silent for exactly three seconds. Then, as if choreographed, all 20 of us stood up simultaneously. Milo reached into his pocket first, pulling out a folded letter and sliding it across the table, his two weeks notice. Nora followed, then Colby, then me. One by one, resignation letters piled up in front of Callahan like white flags of surrender. His mouth opened and closed like a fish gasping for air. You can't all just quit, he stammered, his voice cracking. I'll, I'll reverse the pay cut. We'll go back to the old system. But we were already walking out. The last thing I heard as the door swung shut was Callahan's voice, high and desperate, screaming, wait, no, come back. I'll give you raises. Come back.

Travel reimbursements deposited into my mother's personal account at Kensington Credit Union. Over $28,000 funneled to Gwen's kids. Nothing for mine. Then we found my father's letter. Sealed, marked open. Only if the kids fight. He'd written, if you cannot treat Connor's children the way you treat Gwen's, step aside. Do not dishonor their names. Do not dishonor mine. I filed a petition to remove her as trustee. Breach of FID. Fiduciary duty, unequal distribution, financial mismanagement. The court hearing was quiet, clinical. I presented the disbursement logs, the false bills, the letter. My father's trust consultant, Paul Martinez, testified that Dad's explicit intent was equal treatment. The judge didn't hesitate. I am granting the petition. Elaine Walker is removed as trustee, effective immediately. The court will appoint a neutral fiduciary and order a forensic audit of all transactions. Mother's face went pale. Gwen texted me later. Did you really have mom removed from the trust? This is going to ruin her. You are disgusting. I didn't respond. The audit came back worse than I thought. Gwen had to repay nearly $11,000. My mom faced a civil complaint for restitution. We used the funds the way dad would have wanted. Set up Roth IRA's for Melissa and Riley. Took a week long trip to a remote cabin in the Smoky Mountains. No Disneyland. Just us. Months passed. No forced reunions. No apologies. Silence. We Learned to appreciate my daughter. Stopped asking about grandma. Started laughing again. Loud, free, unapologetic. The best revenge wasn't the court win or the money. It was watching them grow up knowing they were loved unconditionally. That no one could decide they were less important and get away with it.

Makes me feel small and my parents love him because he looks good at parties. I stayed quiet. I called off the wedding yesterday. My parents disowned me, said I'm ungrateful that I'm throwing away my future. She looked up at me. I came here because you're the only person who ever saw me, really saw me, not my last name or my parents money, just me. I took a deep breath. Sarah, I loved you, past tense. She noticed I spent two years building myself into someone your parents would approve of, not because I needed their approval, but because I wanted to prove them wrong. And you know what? I realized what? It didn't matter. They were never going to accept me. You were never going to stand up to them until now, she whispered. Two years too late. I stood. You let them convince you I wasn't enough. And instead of fighting for us, you walked away, too. I didn't see you chasing after me. That's not fair, isn't it? I asked gently. You chose their approval over us. I don't blame you for that, but I can't be your backup plan when the approved option doesn't work out. I'm not here because Jonathan didn't work out. I'm here because I finally realized what I lost. Stood, I love you. I know, but love isn't enough when you won't fight for it. She started crying again. So that's it. We're done. We've been done for two. Years. I'm just finally accepting it. What about everything we had? I smiled sadly. We had potential, but potential doesn't mean anything if you don't fight for it when it matters. Sarah left that night broken, lost. I felt terrible, but I also felt free. Three months later, I met Emma at a charity car show. She was a teacher, down to earth, real. We talked for hours. She didn't care that I owned a business, didn't care about money or status. She cared about who I was. Six months later, I introduced her to my family. My mom pulled me aside. She's wonderful. She is not like Sarah. No, she's better. She chose me when I had nothing to prove. Last month, I proposed. Emma said yes. We're getting married in the fall. Small ceremony, just people who matter. I heard through mutual friends that Sarah is doing okay, working at a non profit, living on her own, finally standing up to her parents. I'm happy for her, really, but I don't regret my decision. You'll never be good enough for our daughter. Her father's words haunted me for years, pushed me to prove him wrong. But in the end, I realized something. I was always good enough. Sarah just needed to believe it, too. And by the time she did, I'd already moved on. Not out of spite, not, not out of revenge, but because I finally understood my worth and I wasn't going to settle for someone Who took two years and a failed engagement to see it. Sometimes the best revenge isn't proving people wrong. It's building a life so good that their opinion stops mattering. Her parents said, I'd never be good enough. Turns out I was always enough, just not for them. And that was perfectly fine with me.

Let us manage it for you just until you're settled. You kicked me out at 13. I said, I think I'll manage. Their lawyer tried to challenge the will. That's when Caldwell dropped the hammer. First, he said, sliding documents across the table. At 16, Graham legally adopted Noah, which means you have no legal standing in this estate. My mother's mouth fell open. That's impossible. Second, Caldwell continued, Graham hired investigators. We have documented proof of every attempt you made to extort money from him over the years, phone records, bank transfers, emails. Their lawyer started sweating. Third, Caldwell said, opening a letter, Graham left a message. Noah, if they've shown up, I told you they would, don't let them take what you've earned. Family isn't who brings you into the world. It's who shows up when the world walks out. My father slammed the table. This is theft. Finally, Caldwell said, the nuclear clause. If anyone can test this will, all assets transfer automatically to the Children's Cancer Foundation. But only parties with legal standing can trigger that clause, and you have none. I leaned back. So, so go ahead, sue me. The only thing you'll win is a charity donation, mom screamed. After everything we gave you, like what? I interrupted the night you dumped me or the 14 years of silence? After security escorted them out, their screams of betrayal and blood echoed through the lobby as everyone stared. Two Days later, they violated the restraining order I'd filed, showed up at the mansion after dark demanding to talk. I called the cops. They were gone in 60 seconds. The doorbell kept ringing like they were rebooting the house. When I opened the door, they shoved past me. Dad studied every corner like he was mentally pricing everything. Mom ran her hand along the banister as if she already lived there. I pointed to the camera in the corner. Say it louder. Judges love this material. Last time I saw them was on the driveway. Camera driving slowly past the gate, eight windows down, staring like tourists who couldn't afford the ticket. Inside, Graham told me once, some people grow when they lose power, others shrink. I'm standing in the office now. Quarterly stats are up 30%. Three new stores under construction. My parents are still out there somewhere shrinking.

I agreed, packed my things and left. Two years later, she knocked on my door crying. But what I told her changed everything. You'll never be good enough for our daughter. Her father said it at Sunday dinner. I was sitting across from him, fork halfway to my mouth. Her mother nodded in agreement. Sarah deserves someone with ambition, with a future, not a mechanic. I was 24, working in an auto shop, saving every penny, going to community college at night for business management. But to them, I was grease under fingernails, blue collar beneath their daughter. Sarah squeezed my hand under the table. Don't listen to them. But I was listening, her father continued. We've supported this relationship long enough. It's time Sarah found someone appropriate, someone from her world. I set down my fork, looked at Sarah, met her parents. You're right. Sarah's eyes widened. What? I'm not good enough for her. Not the way I am now. I stood. So I'm going to leave. Stop wasting her time. Stop holding her back. Sarah jumped up. No, you're not doing this. Yes, I am. I looked at her parents. Thank you for dinner and for the clarity. I walked out. Sarah followed me to my truck. You're really leaving? You deserve better than this. Then constantly defending me to them. I kissed her forehead. If we're meant to be, we'll find our way. Back I drove away, didn't look back. The break up nearly destroyed me, but it also focused me. I stopped going to bars, stopped wasting money, stopped making excuses. I finished my degree in 18 months, used my savings to buy the failing auto shop where I worked, rebranded it, modernized it, built a reputation for honest work and fair prices. Within a year, I had three locations. Within two, I had eight. I hired good people, paid them well, treated them with respect. Business exploded. By year two, I was clearing half a million annually. Bought a house. Nothing flashy, just solid. I dated occasionally, nothing serious. Part of me was still hung up on Sarah. Then one night my doorbell rang. Sarah stood there, mascara running, eyes swollen. Can we talk? Let her in. She sat on my couch shaking. I made a mistake. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life. What happened? I got engaged to Jonathan, the guy my parents set me up with. Lawyer, Ivy League, perfect on paper. She wiped her eyes. He's awful controlling.

When I came back, they mocked me, saying, now you're homeless. I just smiled. What's so funny? They snapped. I replied, the house you sold wasn't actually mine. I'm Benjamin, 32, a real estate agent. Responsible kid who always fixed everyone's problems. While my sister Natalie got bailed out of every mess. Every credit card maxed out, every car payment missed. I watched my parents fund her chaos while telling me to figure it out. Before my trip to Maui, I'd set up an LLC to lease a property with an option to buy. My name wasn't on the deed. Smart Asset Protect. I told my parents I was staying there. Easier than explaining business structures to people who thought I was their emergency fund. Day 7 in Hawaii. I turned on my phone. 19 missed calls from mom, 12 from Dad, seven from Natalie. Dad's text. Important update about the house call. Now. My hands shook as I scrolled through the messages. We handled something for you, mom said, breathless. Your house? It's sold. My fork hit the plate. You're welcome. Natalie needed help. You'll understand when you hear the numbers. They'd met a cash buyer at a diner. Showed him a Zillow screenshot. Signed my name on a bargain bin deed. Why? I hired $380,000 into their account. Paid off Natalie's $214,000 debt. Four maxed cards, a car note, And investor course at 19.9% APR. Kept the rest for family expenses. Natalie texted, finally leveled the playing field. You can crash on my couch if you're lucky. I booked the earliest flight home. When I arrived, mom stood in the yard directing movers. New owner wants to start renovations. I walked inside. The house smelled like Windex. Natalie was there in a sweatshirt that said blessed. Hey, Benny. How was Maui? We sat. Mom beamed, ankles crossed. We made a tough call, but family comes first. You sold a house that doesn't belong to you, I said calmly. It's owned by my LLC under a master lease. The title doesn't have my name anywhere. The deed you signed is worthless. The buyer's face went white. This is a family matter, he muttered. Being outside. Natalie rolled her eyes. Nobody cares about your paperwork games. The bank will, I said, when they investigate the fraud. Dad stepped forward, hands in pockets. Watch your tone. No, he froze, like I'd spoken a language he didn't recognize. Mom tried. Honey voiced reasoning. Benjamin, we saved your credit. We got you out from under. There was no mortgage. I cut in. There was an option. There was income and tenants with booking

No explosives, no weapons. Building is secure. The lead agent frowned. Could have stashed them elsewhere. She turned back to me. Where are they hidden? There's nothing to hide. My parents were whispering about lawyers. The agents pulled up more recordings. My voice saying, pushing, now throwing grenades. Full squad, wipe. Nobody's surviving this. Every phrase sounded horrifying. Play the whole recordings. I said voice, horse, everything, not just pieces. Those are clipped out of context.

We can take them. The agent's face changed. She jestered for another. Got my explosives ready. Taking out at least 20 people. Zach, you got grenades too? Zach's voice came through. Yeah, six grenades. How many left in the match? The tech agent was already pulling up Fortnite on the tablet before the lead agent asked. The map filled the screen, showing Pleasant Park, Tilted Towers, Lazy Lake, named locations with buildings everywhere. He Scrolled through weapon categories, pump shotgun, s C, a R, grenades labeled as explosives. The lead agent's jaw tightened. She played three more recordings in rapid succession. Every single one had the same pattern, my threatening phrases followed immediately by clear game references, locations on the Fortnite map, weapon names from the game, player counts in matches, storm circles, closing squad strategies. Someone had deliberately cut out every word that proved I was talking about Fortnite, every mention of the game, every reference to virtual locations and digital weapons. What was left sounded like a terrorist planning a school attack. Mom stopped crying. Dad's face went red with rage. Not at me, at them. Someone edited these recordings, the lead agent said quietly, stripped every piece of context, committed them as credible threats. Through our anonymous tipline, she reached over and unlocked my handcuffs. They left in under 5 minutes. No apology, no explanation of who did this or why. Just gone. I sat on my bed rubbing my wrists while mom hugged me and dad screamed at their cars pulling away. My monitor was still on. Match ended 20 minutes ago. Someone else got the Victory Royale. I've been one elimination away from my first win.

When my daughter Sophia was 15, she flopped down on my bed one night and said, mom, I want a tattoo for my 18th birthday. Most parents would have shut that down immediately, but I didn't. Instead, we spent three years planning it together. She wanted something for her grandmother, who died when she was 12. Her idea was a small floral design with her grandmother's favourite flowers and her initials tucked into the stem on her shoulder blade. We looked at portfolios online, talked about artists, and saved reference photos. We never told my husband Brian about her plans because he thinks tattoos are trashy. By her 18th birthday, we had the perfect design ready. We booked the appointment for the weekend after her birthday and told Brian we were going shopping for dorm stuff. He barely looked up from his phone. When we left the tattoo shop, Sophia was bouncing on her heels. Mom, what if it looks bad? I squeezed her hand. It's going to be perfect. The artist called us back and showed Sophia the stencil. Her eyes filled with tears the second she saw it. That's exactly what I wanted. They got her situated in the chair and press the stencil so onto her shoulder blade. Sophia twisted to see it in the mirror and nodded, yes, right there. The artist put on fresh gloves and picked up the tattoo gun. That's when the Front door slammed open so hard it hit the wall. Brian came charging into the back room. Stop this right now. Do not touch her! The tattoo artist set down the gun and held up both hands. Sir, I'm going to need you to calm down. Brian pointed at Sophia. Get out of that chair. We're leaving. I stepped forward. Brian, what are you doing here? He whipped around to face me. What am I doing here? What are you doing here? You took our daughter to get a tattoo behind my back? Apparently, her little brother found the appointment confirmation on her laptop and showed Brian because he thought he was helping. And turned back to Sophia. You're going to regret this forever. Sophia's voice came out small. Dad, it's for grandma. He laughed, but it wasn't a real laugh. Your grandmother would be ashamed of you right now. Absolutely ashamed. Sophia started crying. Brian kept going. No daughter of mine is going to look like she belongs on a street corner. You can forget about.

They're being questioned right now. Miles, Terry, Zach. All three were in interrogation rooms because of me. A younger agent spoke from the doorway. His teacher say he's isolated, eats lunch alone, spends all his time gaming. The lead agent showed my parents a pamphlet titled Warning Signs of Teen Violence, named school shootings, Columbine, Parkland, Uvalde. Each word made mom cry harder. They found my notebook with Fortnite strategies, building patterns, weapon stats, landing spots, tactical planning, the agent said, photographing every page. Dad tried to defend me. Kevin's never been violent. He's never been in a fight. That's what every parent says right before it happens. The agent replied.

My daughters, Melissa, 10, and Riley, 8, still in their grass stained soccer uniforms from practice looked down at those cheap paper napkins, then up at me with confused, wounded eyes. Across the table, my sister Gwen's girls unwrapped their pre ordered gold foil boxes from some boutique Italian place downtown. Perfectly portioned pasta, slices of tiramisu stacked like edible towers. This wasn't new. Gwen, 38, has been the golden child since birth. She married well, lives in a four bedroom suburban house with a dog that gets Christmas presents from my parents while my daughter still wait for birthday cards. Hope left the building years ago, but this dinner crossed a line I didn't know existed. Halfway through the meal, my mom leaned toward Gwen. Should we tell them? She asked with a sly smile. My stomach flipped. My wife Paige's hand tightened around her fork. We're taking the girls to Disneyland this fall, Gwen beamed. Surprise trip, just the four of us. Paige straightened in her seat. You're taking your girls? Gwen shrugged like it was nothing. Yeah, mom and I planned it last week. Flights are already booked. Stared at My mom, you planned a family vacation and didn't even tell us. It's not a family vacation, she laughed. It's a treat for the girls. Our girls are your granddaughters, too, page said. Voice suddenly ice. I'm sure they'll get to go someday. My mom waved her hand dismissively. It's not a big deal. Melissa looked down at her lap, her small hands folding and refolding her napkin. Kylie blinked rapidly, trying not to cry. I stood up without a word, walked outside into the cold night air. Hands shaking, my chest felt hollow. That's when I realized I've been waiting my whole life for this family to change. They never would. And my daughters were learning the same painful lesson I'd Learned as a kid. So I stopped waiting. Three weeks later, I got a call from my father's old lawyer named Gerald. Turns out dad had set up a 60 thousand dollar trust for all his grandchildren before he died 10 years ago. My mom was the trustee, the one person who should have protected his wishes. Your sister signed her paperwork three years ago. He said her daughters have already received early dispersments, roughly $10,000 each for educational enrichment. My daughters, zero. I hung up, sat in silence for a long moment. Then I called a financial advisor named Denise who came highly recommended from a colleague. We found everything false.

The artist looked at me. Ma'am, I can't do this with him here. I'm sorry. I put myself between Brian and the chair. I'll get him out. Keep going. I looked right at Brian. You need to leave right now or I'm calling the police. He took a step closer to me. I'm not going anywhere. You're letting her ruin her life. Brian pointed at the artist. If you put one Mark on my daughter, I will sue you. Do you understand me? The artist's hand was shaking. Sir, I really need you to leave. Brian turned to look at me like he didn't recognize me. If you do this, I'm done. I'm completely done with both of you. I crossed my arms. That's your choice, but we're not leaving until she gets her tattoo. He stood there and waited for me to change my mind. When I didn't, he shook his head. I can't believe you're choosing a stupid piece of trash tattoo over our marriage. Then he turned and walked out. Sophia was crying so hard her shoulders were shaking. I touched her arm. Do you want to stop? We can leave right now if you want. She shook her head and wiped her face. No, I want this. He's not going to ruin this for me. The artist took a deep breath. Okay, let's get started. She talked to Sophia the whole time. She asked about her grandmother. What She was like, and what her favourite flower meant. Sophia stopped crying after about 20 minutes. When it was done, Sophia stood in front of the mirror, turning to see it from every angle. Mom, it's perfect. Look at it. She was smiling for real. Now, when we pulled into the driveway later, Ryan's car was gone. I checked my phone. One text, I'm staying at my parents until you come to your senses. That was four days ago and he still hasn't come home.

My girlfriend told me to get out of our bed and sleep on the couch because I went to a bar for two hours. Two hours. I texted her the whole time I was there and even brought her food on the way home. So here's what happened. My Buddy turned 24 last week and his girlfriend just turned 21. They wanted to hit up this bar downtown to celebrate her actually being able to drink legally now. I told my girlfriend I was going at 7 and would be back by 9. She said okay. I even offered to grab her Taco Bell or something on the way home since it would be late, and she mentioned wanting a burrito earlier. I sent her like four texts while I was there. Stuff like, hey, we just got here and just ordered drinks and about to head out soon. Normal stuff. I had one beer and one of those tiny test tube shots. I bought three shots total for the birthday girl. My buddy bought my beer because he lost this dumb bet we made on the drive over about whether the bar would be packed or dead. I got home at like 9:15. She was already in bed watching Tik Toks with the lamp on. I handed her the Taco Bell bag, he got up, and I thought she was gonna go eat at the kitchen table, but instead she walked straight to the Trash can and dumped the whole bag in there. I was like what the hell? I just spent 12 bucks on that. She said she already ate. I told her we could have at least put it in the fridge so I could eat it tomorrow morning. That set her off. She started yelling about how I was out with some girl and how I was a terrible boyfriend. I was so confused. I told her it was my buddy and his girlfriend. He pulled up Instagram on her phone and shoved it in my face. It was a photo his girlfriend posted of the three of us at the bar holding up the little shot glasses. I literally told her in my texts that his girlfriend was coming because it was her birthday. She never responded to that text, but I figured she just fell asleep or something. Apparently she saw it and decided to just stay quiet and wait until I got home to blow up. She called his girlfriend a whore. Just straight up said I was out partying with some whore. I tried to explain that it was my friend's girl.

I started eating more in front of him. My boyfriend sat me down at his apartment three months ago and gave me an ultimatum. He said I needed to lose 20 pounds in two months or he was done with our relationship. He claimed it was for my health and that he was just being honest because he cared about us. I looked at him for a long moment, then I smiled and said, okay. That night, I came back over with a large pepperoni pizza and ate it right in front of him, his face. It was just as delicious. Day 3, I showed up at his place and made myself a massive breakfast, pancakes stacked high, crispy bacon, scrambled eggs with cheese. I sat across from him at his kitchen table wearing my baggiest hoodie and ate every single bite while he stared at me like I'd lost my mind. What are you doing? He finally asked. Just shrugged and reached for more syrup. By day 7, he was getting angry. I brought ingredients and cooked pasta carbonara at his place, you know, like the real kind with cream and bacon and Parmesan. He watched me twirl it onto my fork and couldn't stay quiet anymore. Are you trying to make me leave? Is this some kind of game? I didn't answer, just kept eating. Day 12, I wore loose sweatpants to our dinner date. He stared at My outfit and made this cruel little comment, looks like you're giving up already. Are you hiding something under there? I ordered dessert. Now the comments got worse. Day 20, he started calling me lazy when I came over for meals. Day 25, he took a photo of me eating and threatened to show his friends what he has to deal with. I actually posed for that one, smiled real big and took another bite of my burger. Day 35 was when the insults really escalated. He called me disgusting. I was embarrassing myself. Told me no one else would ever want someone who let themselves go like this. I just kept eating bigger portions every time I saw him. By day 42, he was completely obsessed. He started timing my meals with his phone whenever I came over, calculating calories out loud and getting the numbers totally wrong, by the way, trying to shame me with.

A week later, I found out he moved in with a woman two states away. His son keeps asking why dad doesn't call. I keep saying he's busy. My brother Garrett showed up at nine PM with six year old Owen, a duffle bag and this look I'd never seen before. Just need to clear my head, he said. Work stress, maybe two days Max. Owen cried himself to sleep that first night, asked for his dad at breakfast. I texted Garrett. No response. Day 3, his calls went straight to voicemail. Day 5, I'm buying Owen new clothes because the duffel only had three outfits. Day 7, Garrett's landlord called me. Apartment emptied. Forwarding address in Nevada. Nevada. I found her Instagram that night. Rochelle, 23 years old. Pool parties and poker chips and bottle service photos. Garrett in the background of three photos, arm around her waist. Comments going back 6 months. Six months of baby and heart emojis while he was still talking Owen in at night. Owen asked every single day, when's dad coming back? At first I said soon. Then I said he's figuring some things out. By week 3, I was saying he's working on something really important, buddy. The lies got easier. Month 2, I enrolled Owen in school, used my address. The secretary asked if I had legal guardianship. I said we're working on it. She gave Me this look like she'd seen this before and handed me the enrollment forms. Anyway, month 3, Owen stopped asking, started calling me by my name instead of Aunt Iris, started sleeping through the night. Four months in, Garrett finally called, not to check on Owen, not to apologize, to ask if I could keep him a bit longer. Said things were complicated right now. Said Rochelle wasn't ready for the kid dynamic. Yet his voice sounded different, lighter, like he'd shrugged off a backpack he been carrying too long. I asked when he was coming back. Iris, come on, you know how he is with you. He's better off there. I said, yes. What else could I say? Put the kid in foster care. Because his dad chose a woman he'd known for six months. My husband Trevor wasn't thrilled about the financial hit. We had our own two kids, mortgage, car payments, but he never once suggested we shouldn't do it. Then last month, everything changed. My uncle Garrets and my uncle passed away, lung cancer, 72 years old. Never.

Effective immediately, everyone's taking a 15% pay cut. You're all working too fast, Mr. Callahan announced, slamming his palm on the table. We all sat there stunned, waiting for the punch line. He continued, if you're finishing your projects before the allocated time, you're obviously cutting corners. Quality work takes time. I raised my hand to argue that efficiency meant we could take on more clients, but he cut me off with a sharp gesture. The time I've allocated for each task is perfect. 40 hours for a marketing proposal, 20 for a client report, 60 for a website redesign. These aren't suggestions, they're requirements. When I pointed out that I've been completing proposals in 20 hours with zero client complaints and five star reviews, he actually laughed. That's impossible without cutting corners. From now on, anyone completing work before their allocated hours will be written up for poor quality, regardless of what the client thinks. New policy was printed, laminated, and posted on every wall. It sucked, but I figured if I just went along with it, Callahan would eventually realize this was dumb. That's when I accidentally looked at Milo's cubicle, and I had to do a double take. Milo was leaning back in his chair, feet up on his desk, scrolling through his phone with AirPods in. What are you doing? I whispered, worried Milo was about to get in. Trouble? He just grinned and showed me his computer screen. A completed financial report sitting in his drafts, time stamp showing he'd finished it three hours ago. I'm running the clock, he said casually. The report took me five hours, but Callahan said it should take 20. So here I am, ensuring quality for another 15 hours. I stared at him in disbelief. You're just going to sit here? Milo nodded toward Callahan's office. Earlier this morning, I actually submitted something a day after it was due. Callahan praised me in front of everyone for being thorough and detail oriented. I was stunned. I glanced towards Nora, and to my surprise, she was doing the exact same thing. She had her laptop open to a completed presentation while watching Netflix on her phone. 13 more hours to go, she whispered when she caught me looking. Even Colby had already set up what looked like a leisure station at his desk. Coffee, snacks, a book, and his Nintendo Switch. The pattern was everywhere I looked. The entire office had transformed into a waiting room. The most surreal moment came that afternoon when Callahan walked through, saw everyone at their desks doing nothing, and actually smiled. Now this is what I like to see. Excuse me. What? He stopped right next to Milo

The EMTs documented everything. The black eye, finger marks on his arms, a boot shaped bruise on his back. In the morning, Finley filed an emergency custody petition. The black eye changes everything by Noon, Sierra showed up with Logan screaming. The same officer arrived. He recognized Logan immediately. Logan had a record, assault, domestic violence, d U, y. When they refused to leave, he cuffed them both. At the emergency hearing, Finley presented the abuse photos, police reports, Logan's record. he revealed Sierra had been collecting disability benefits for Eli, claimed he had severe autism. She'd been pocketing thousands meant to help him. When Eli testified, he told the truth simply, Logan hit him. Mommy told him not to cry. He ran to us because that's where he felt safe. The judge terminated Sierra's parental rights completely two months later. At the finalization hearing, Eli yelled, I have a real family now. I held him tight while he buried his face in my shoulder. Sierra never appealed. Eli's 5 now and calls us mom and dad.

So I killed his new marriage with the truth. My mom died giving birth to me, hemorrhage during an emergency C section. My dad looked at me in the N, I, and told the nurse that thing killed my wife. He signed custody papers to his sister before I left the hospital, didn't even name me Aunt Nancy did that. I saw him at every family gathering. He'd sit three seats down, talk to everyone but me. When I was 6, I tried climbing into his lap. Thanksgiving, he stood up so fast I fell backward onto the tile. Don't touch me, he said, and left. My cousins asked why daddy didn't like me. I said I didn't know. I did, though. Nancy told me the truth when I was 8. At 10, I wrote him a Father's Day card. Dear dad, I'm sorry for what happened. I love you anyway. I left it on his truck at my uncle's BBQ. He read it, crumpled it up and threw it in the trash. I was watching. Middle school was hell. He'd show up to my cousin Tyler's football games, scream his lungs out, buy him pizza. After my soccer games, empty bleachers. Once my coach asked if my dad was coming to championships. He, he's deployed. I lied. Easier than explaining he was 10 minutes away. High school broke something in me. Junior year, Grandpa died. At the funeral, I tried to hug my dad. He shoved me back. You don't get to mourn him. You killed his daughter, people. Nancy pulled me away. Graduation day, I sent him an invitation. It would mean everything if you came. He showed up, sat in the back. When I walked across the stage, I looked for him. He was on his phone. Afterward, he found me in the parking lot. You're 18 now. I fulfilled my legal obligation. We're done. Don't contact me again. I stopped trying, went to therapy, took Nancy's last name legally, built a life, met someone who looked at me like I mattered. I thought I'd heal. Then 12 years later, my phone rang. Unknown number. It's Brian. I need to see you. Why? I'm married. Caitlin wants to meet you. She doesn't understand why we don't talk. What did you tell her? That we had a falling out when you were a teenager.

Then she said the worst part. Your dad would want you to share, right? It only added insult to injury. The next day, when Bridget posted a photo of the outfit she planned to wear to her party. She was wearing my dad's favorite color combination, the same one I had told her I was going to wear. She tagged it birthday girl energy. That night, my mom found me stare staring at old photos of my dad's arcade and asked what was wrong. I told her everything and started crying halfway through. She listened without interrupting, and when I finished, she pulled out her phone. Who are you texting? I asked. He looked up at me with this expression I had never seen before. Something between anger and satisfaction. Your aunt manages the venue Bridget booked. My heart stopped beating. What? My mom's smile got bigger. She mentioned last week that some teenager booked the main event space for March 15th, and she felt terrible because she knew it was your birthday. I felt like I couldn't breathe. Why didn't you say anything? She shrugged. I wanted to see if Bridget would do the right thing on her own. Clearly, she didn't. My mom made a phone call right there in front of me and put it on speaker phone. Hey, sis, about that party on the 15th. Did the client come in to sign the Final contract yet? There was a pause. No. So there's nothing legally stopping you from canceling that booking. Interesting. She hung up, and suddenly I felt like I couldn't breathe. Now let's talk about what we're doing for your birthday instead. On my birthday, she called everyone from my original bowling Ali List and threw me a huge party at our house. My house was full of people laughing and eating cake that my mom had made from scratch. Meanwhile, Bridget was standing in an empty venue parking lot because the booking had been canceled. She showed up at my front door later that night and saw everyone inside through the window. My mom answered the door, and I heard her say, sorry, sweetie. This party is for the birthday girl and her real friends, and slammed the door in her face.

The entire family raised their glasses while my three year old fought for breath in the ICU. Five years later, they came crawling back. I'm Daniel, 32, owner of a small interior design company in Austin. My parents, Martin and Linda, run a furniture store. Comfortable enough for the lifestyle they crave. To them, success is about appearances. My brother Ryan is two years younger, but you'd think he was royalty. When I got an A, dad would nod. When Ryan got a B+, they'd bake a cake. I graduated high school with a 3.8 and got $50. Two months later, Ryan's 2.1 graduation earned him a $15,000 party with a DJ and ice sculpture. I Learned early I was on my own. After college, I started my own design company. That's when I met Emma. We married, had Lily, and thought we had everything figured out. But we've been careless about one thing. Health insurance. The small business owner without employer coverage. We kept putting it off. That decision would haunt me forever. Five years ago, when Lily was 3, she developed a cough that wouldn't go away. One afternoon, she collapsed while playing with Emma. We rushed her to the ER. She has a congenital lung abnormality. The doctor said she needs immediate surgery. The billing coordinator slid a paper across. $120,000. I gripped Emma's hand. We'll get the money. Just save our Daughter desperate. I drove to my parents house. When I walked in, it was packed with guests. Ryan's pre wedding Celebration. They were throwing a party while my daughter was dying. Mom, dad, Lily has a tumor. She need surgery immediately or she might not make it. The hospital requires $120,000. Can you help my mother set down her wine? We've already committed to Ryan's wedding. We can't cancel now. My father crossed his arms. We've spent $300,000 on this wedding. If we give you that money, there won't be a wedding. I turned to Ryan standing there in his tailored suit. I dropped to my knees in the middle of their party. Ryan, please, I'm begging you. Lily will die without this money.

So I called CPS. After finding him alone for three days, starving on cereal, my sister Sierra called at 3:00am, sobbing. Eli's been hurt. Hit by a drunk driver. They airlifted him for emergency brain surgery. I need you. We packed through tears, begged airlines for emergency seats, watched $8,000 in non refundable honeymoon bookings vanish. We'd save for two years for this trip. On the flight, Sierra ghosted me. No text, no calls. When we landed, I called Children's Hospital. No pediatric trauma patients by that name. My blood went cold. We called six hospitals. Nothing. Sarah's phone went straight to voicemail. We drove to her house and used the spare key. The door was unlocked. I expected to find Eli in bed with Sierra standing over him. Instead, my four year old nephew was on the couch playing his tablet, surrounded by empty cereal bowls, completely uninjured. Saw us and cheered. Yay, you're back! Where's your mommy? She left three days ago. She said you'd be back soon. Three days alone? He was four. You didn't get into any accident? No. Why would I be hurt? I can take care of myself. I called Sierra from her landline. California girls blared in the background. Hey, what's up? She slurred. You told me Eli was in surgery. She cackled. I knew if I lied, you would come back. You were being super extra about Your honeymoon must be nice. Having money while single moms struggle behind me. Eli asked in a small voice if he could live with us. Mom doesn't want me anymore. Sierra heard him through the phone. Her tone turned venomous, turning my son against me. This was your plan all along. I hung up. I sat next to Eli. Were you scared? He shrugged. Mommy said I was a big boy. She's done it before when you were busy. My stomach dropped. This wasn't the first time. I called child services immediately. The social worker came the next day, interviewed Eli, photographed the empty fridge and mess. She warned me the system favors keeping families together. Two days later, Sierra showed at our door. Hair greasy, reeking of alcohol. She demanded Eli back. I told her no. She tried pushing past me, started screaming about her rights. I called the cops. When they arrived, Sierra ran to them, crying. They stole my baby. The officer separated us. I explained everything. They asked Eli if he wanted to go home with Mommy. He shook his head hard.

She pulled out her phone and showed me her photo gallery, pictures of us together over the years at family dinners, holiday gatherings, movie nights. You're telling me you never felt anything, never thought about it? I hadn't. Or at least I'd never let myself think about it because she was my stepsister and this was exactly the situation I was in right now. My phone kept buzzing. Claire was calling. Lana watched me decline it. See, you can't even answer because you know this is real. She stood up and walked toward my door, but before leaving, she turned back. I'm not going away. And eventually you're going to stop fighting this when you're ready to be honest with yourself. You know where my room is. After she left, I sat there completely spiraling. My brain was screaming at me to go to Claire to tell her everything immediately. Eventually, I grabbed my keys and drove to Claire's apartment. When she opened the door, I must have looked insane. What's wrong? I walked past her words tumbling out. Lana texted me, said she'd been into me for 3 years, came to my room, told me to stop being a coward. Everything spilled out while Claire listened. When I finished, out of breath and waiting for her to freak out, she almost smiled. Lana really committed to it, huh? I stared at her. What? She picked up her Phone and showed me a text thread with Lana. I asked her to do it this morning to see what you do. My brain stopped working. You told her to text me that. Claire nodded. I needed to know you'd come straight to me, that you'd tell me immediately instead of hiding it. The room spun. You used my stepsister to test me. She volunteered. I mentioned wanting to know if you'd be honest if another girl came onto you. Lana said she'd help. Thought it would be funny. I stood there frozen. Lana had been in on this the whole time. Every word, every photo, sitting on my bed, all fake, all planned. That's insane. Everything went back to normal after that. Claire apologized for taking it too far. Lana and I laughed about it at dinner the next week. Month later, Claire asked me about it again, proud of how I'd handled the whole thing. See, you came straight to me. Didn't even think about it. I nodded and told her she was right. But what I didn't tell her was that before I drove to her apartment that night, I stood outside Lana's bedroom door for almost 10 minutes. Just stood there staring at the doorknob, my hand halfway raised to knock.

I typed back quickly. Lana, what the hell? You're my sister. The reply came instantly. Stepsister. Big difference. Then another message. And I've liked you way before our parents even met. You know that. I genuinely had no idea. We'd known each other since our parents started dating three years ago, but she'd never given any indication she was into me. Another text.

Before I could lock it, Lana walked in, wearing one of my old hoodies and shorts, closing the door behind her. We need to talk about this. She, I said. Sitting on my bed like this was completely normal. I backed up against My desk. Lana, no, this is wrong. We can't. She rolled her eyes. You're making this way more dramatic than it needs to be. Our parents got married. We didn't. Not actually related. I tried to explain that it didn't matter, that it would destroy our family, that I had a girlfriend. She just laughed. Claire, please.

You gonna tell her I'm in your room? That we're having this conversation? I wasn't going to tell Claire anything because how would I even explain this situation? Lana moved closer. Look, I've been patient. I didn't say anything when our parents started dating because I thought we'd figure it out eventually.

I'd helped her move twice, dog sat for her. Probably 15 times. I asked her the same thing. Silence. Then, Connor, I have Pilates at noon and honestly, you're kind of not my problem anymore.

I gave him an address four hours away in another state. Just you, I said, my throat tight. He didn't ask why I was being evicted or what happened. He just started loading boxes. They were fake boxes, old textbooks, kitchen junk I'd pulled from my garage. He never questioned it. We drove back in silence for the first hour. Then he bought me breakfast at a truck stop and said, you'll land on your feet, man. You always do. I almost told him right there. That afternoon, I called my Lawyer and had her draft the paper paperwork. By Monday morning, Benji had a $2 million trust fund in his name, full college tuition covered for his two kids and a 10% partnership offer in my next venture. I didn't make a big announcement. I just texted him, check your email, read everything. He called me 20 minutes later crying so hard he couldn't speak. When he finally got words out, he Said, Connor, what did you do? I'm just giving it to someone who showed up. I said, Derek and Vanessa found out 3 months later through a LinkedIn post. I didn't even write. My lawyer made it. Both sent long texts apologizing, asking to reconnect, saying they'd had a rough week back then. I left them unread.

You're ruining my Vegas vibe. I replied, you're right. I've been with Karen for three years. She lived in my condo rent free while working part time, spending most of her money on clothes and brunch. I was fine being the provider when things were good. Tuesday changed everything. We got the call that my mom's chemo had failed. Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. The doctor used words like palliative and comfort my dad, who I've seen cry twice in my life, down on the phone. I was in my home office, silently crying and staring at the wall. We were discussing hospice. Karen walked in, holding a sequin dress up to herself. Are you still moping? She asked. Not what's wrong? Not, how's your dad? Just still moping.

I've been looking forward to Vegas for months. I just stared at her, unable to form words. Look, I'm sorry about your mom, okay? But you've been a total black cloud for weeks. You need to snap out of it. She threw the dress on the bed. Seriously, stop crying about your mom's cancer. You're ruining my Vegas vibe. Something in my head flipped. Not anger, just cold, quiet clarity. You're right. I said, my Voice monotone. My mistake. She blinked, surprised. Then she smiled, smug and satisfied. Good. Now I'm going to get my nails done. We leave at 8:00am tomorrow. Try to pull yourself together. She left. I sat there for 10 minutes. Then I opened my laptop. First I canceled our flight. The tickets converted to a 1,200 dollar travel credit in my name only. Next, canceled the hotel, lost the 400 dollar deposit. Then I logged into my credit card account. Karen was an authorized user. It's what she used for everything. I clicked deactivate. Finally, I called a 24 hour locksmith. I need an emergency, Ricky. I called my sister Maya. When I told her what happened, the string of curse words would have made a sailor blush. I'm coming over with boxes, she said. By 9 p m. The locks were changed. Maya had packed everything into 28 boxes and four suitcases moved to the building storage unit. I drove to my parents house and held my mom's hand until she fell asleep. My phone started buzzing at 6:04.

Leo, what did you do? Karen was hysterical. Airport announcements in the background. My ticket is gone. The lady said the reservation was cancelled. I tried to buy a new ticket and my card was declined. I cancelled the trip and deactivated your card. Stunned silence, then a shriek. I'm coming to the apartment right now. Don't bother. The locks are changed. The things are in 28 boxes in the basement storage. Maya will coordinate pickup. You can't do this. I live there. You were a guest. Karen, your stay is over. My mom is dying. I'm going to sit with her now. Goodbye. I hung up and blocked her number. A week later, I got a certified letter. Aaron was suing for $2,500 for the MacBook Pro she bought on my credit card without telling me. $1,200 for the Vegas trip and $800 for a ceramic hair, $40 home goods decoration she claimed was priceless family art. My dad's lawyer sent back a response so scathing it outlined that as a non tenant, she had zero eviction rights. The MacBook charge was potential fraud and we had signed inventory including the 40 dollar Heron. We heard nothing after that. My mom passed away three days later peacefully in her sleep. Day of her funeral, I got a call from jail. Karen had assaulted her own mother during a fight about the laptop Bill she couldn't pay. Leo, you have To help me. Please call my mom. Tell her to drop the charges. The sheer entitlement to call me the man whose vibe she worried about while his mother was dying to ask me to save her from assaulting her own mother over the laptop she tried to steal from me. No, Karen, I will not be helping you. Not now, not ever. Six months later, she took me to small claims court, showed up with a binder containing my credit card statements, the home goods receipt for the 40 dollar Heron and a recording confirming the Vegas vibe comment. The judge looked at Karen for 10 solid seconds. Is that true, ma'am? Karen sputtered. I, it was. I was upset he was ruining my birthday. The judge's face was stone. Ma'am, you are wasting this court's time. Case dismissed with prejudice. Last I heard, Karen's working as a cashier at a craft store.

She showed up with some dude named Connor from yoga, clearly trying to make me jealous. I shook his hand, welcomed him, then proceeded to destroy everyone at Cody Names while paying them zero attention. Halfway through the night, Tara cornered me. You don't even care that I'm here with someone else. Why would I? We're friends. Friends date people. She couldn't answer because there was no answer that didn't admit she wanted me to pine for her while she found herself. But the best part, her bestie, Marissa, had been extra friendly all night, kept finding excuses to talk to me, laugh at my jokes. Next morning, Tara texted. What was that with you and Marissa? We were just talking. Friends talk. She's my best friend and I'm your friend, too, right? Friends can be friends with each other's friends. By week 3, Connor from yoga had ghosted Tara. Meanwhile, Marissa invited me to a comedy show. The date was fantastic. She was actually hilarious. Something I'd never noticed when she was just Tara's friend. When Tara found out, she loaded, you can't date my best friend. It's girl code. I thought I was your friend, not your ex. I really don't understand. Friends don't have dibs on who their friends can date. She called 17 times. I put my phone on silent. Sunday morning, 6 a. M. She's pounding on my door. You're doing this to hurt me. I'm living my life. You're the One who decided we shouldn't be together. That's when her true entitlement showed. She started calling mutual friends, spinning revenge stories. She tried sabotaging my work, calling my office, claiming I was having a mental health crisis. She even faked a pregnancy scare, then conveniently got her period the next day. Her biggest mistake was showing up at Marissa's work, causing a scene. Security escorted her out. The restraining order was her wake up call. That and getting fired for missing work during her meltdowns. Last I heard, she moved back with her parents and works part time at a bookstore. She sent one final email. You turned my best friend against me, made me look crazy, ruined my life, all because you couldn't handle being just friends. Turns out giving someone exactly what they ask for is the cruelest thing you can do.

I'm biting my pillow. Then I hear him frantically calling someone. Yeah, man, I have no idea what happened. I just woke up and my phone saying it's almost 2, but that can't be right. Long pause, then complete silence for five seconds. Wait, what do you mean it's only 11? I peek out and see him in the kitchen staring at the microwave. 11:03, then the stove. 11:03, wall clock. 11:04, he walks back, holding his phone like it betrayed him. Goes into settings, rolling, then stops. His face changes. He whispers, Saskatchewan. What the hell is Saskatchewan? Sees his alarms, eyes go wide. He sinks to the floor, back against wall, staring at nothing. I wait, then casually walk out, stretching. Morning, I say. Cheerful. He looks up, face pure defeat. Morning, dude, it's 11. I check my phone. Oh, yeah, 11:05. Why? What time did you think? He doesn't answer. Then quietly, where are my shoes? I give him my confused look. What do you, I mean, all of them, every pair gone. I scrunched my face. That's super weird, man. Check outside. Why would they be outside? I shrug. You do weird stuff. Maybe the porch. He goes to check, opens the door, looks around, garage, even the trash, nothing. He comes back, doesn't say a word, walks to the couch, head in hands. I make breakfast, eggs, toast, orange juice. He's frozen on that couch. I sit eating, scrolling my phone full hour. Passes, he hasn't moved. Finally turns toward me. I know you did something. I take goodbye. Did what? My shoes, my phone, the time, all of it. You did this. My smile. That's a serious accusation. Got proof. He stares hard, opens his mouth, closes it, opens it, closes it, nothing. I didn't break anything or steal permanently, just moved stuff. He stands, goes to his room, slams the door hard enough, the apartment shakes. Two days later, my dad asked me to help grab Halloween decorations from the attic. We head up. My cousin tags along. Dad's pulling boxes when my cousin freezes, staring behind the Christmas boxes, reaches back, pulls out one shoe, then another. Another. His face goes from confused to understanding to pure rage in three seconds. Looks at me. I'm avoiding eye contact. Hard. He grabs every shoe, climbs down, walks to his room. Violent packing sounds. He comes out, tells my parents thank you in this super polite voice and leaves. Doesn't glance at me. Now whenever he visits, everything's different. Phone in his pocket at all times, even in the shower. Ziplock bag, sleeps with it under his pillow. Shoes locked in a suitcase 24 7. Totally worth it. Totally.

What I did. Grandma moved fast. She closed the trust fund they drained for their Turks vacation. She shut down every automatic transfer. She sent a letter to Natalie's school withdrawing sponsorship. She called the car dealership about Rachel's lease. Within 48 hours, my parents mortgage was in default. Rachel's card was maxed. Natalie's school sent a collections notice. They had to pull her out and enroll her in public school. Rachel's leased car got repossessed in a target parking lot while she was inside screaming at a manager. My mom showed up at my old apartment. The landlord told her I'd moved. No forwarding address. She tried Grandma's house. Frank answered chewing a toothpick. They don't live here and you're not welcome either. The calls kept coming. Voicemails turned from panic to rage to begging. You're destroying this family. We raised you better than this. Please, Stacy, we're sorry. Just talk to us. I didn't respond to a single one. Two months later, my dad sent a Facebook message. Their house was in foreclosure. He blamed me for everything, said I was vindictive, said Eli wasn't even Aaron's real son and I knew it. I blocked him. Blocked all of them. Eli and I moved into our new place. Grandma and Frank came over every Sunday. Eli, I started calling Frank Grandpa. We built a life with people who actually loved us. Last week, I got a letter handwritten, no return address. Inside was an Old photo of me and Eli from years ago. On the back, one sentence, you always thought you were stronger than you are. I stared at it for a long time. Then I tore it up and flushed it because I am stronger than they thought, stronger than they ever were, stronger than what they made me survive. I didn't fall apart. I didn't egg. I didn't disappear. I raised a child in a storm and taught him how to stand even when no one claps for him. And I protected that with the kind of fire they'll never understand. They can block me, erase me, pretend I never existed, but they'll never forget what it felt like to lose the only one who never needed them.

So I treated her exactly like I treat my other friends, with boundaries. Tara and I had been together for two years, living together for one. We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer where I was supposed to be her plus 1. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends. We get along so well, have the same friend group. We make amazing friends but not amazing partners. Here's what killed me, she said. All this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay. You've already got an exit strategy. I said, we're adults, we're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies. Okay, I said, yeah, let's be friends. Actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. I treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7 a. M, could you drop off my work laptop? Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office. Monday, can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans Monday works better. She didn't like that, but what was she gonna say? We are just friends now. Week 2, Tara started cracking. She showed up at the apartment while I was at work, still using her key, helped herself to groceries, did laundry, took a shower. I texted her, I'll need the key back. My friends don't have keys to my place. This is ridiculous. We live together. We used to live together. Now we're friends. Different relationship, different boundaries. She came by that evening, furious. You changed the locks. You no longer live here. Here's a box of your stuff. I'm treating you exactly like I treat my friends. None of them have keys to my place. But I'm not just any friend. According to you, that's exactly what you are. The real kicker came at game night with our friend group.

I bought the lakehouse from my parents in 2017, paid 180 k cash, full legal sale, my name on the deed. This place was everything to our family growing up. Every summer, my grandparents would invite us up for a week. Best memories of my childhood happened there. Then in 2016, my sister got accepted to her dream college, one of those big prestige just schools everyone was celebrating. I was proud of her, too. A week later, my dad calls. Have you found a house yet? I've been saving since I was 20. My family knew I was actively looking. I told him, no, not yet. What about the lakehouse we're thinking of selling? That hit me hard. Why would you sell it? Turns out my sister had no college savings. The scholarship she was counting on fell through and my parents couldn't afford her tuition. I asked why she didn't just get student loans. We don't want her ruining her credit this young. So their solution was to sell the family lakehouse and use my money to finance her entire college experience. Four years, everything. I loved that house. After thinking it over, I agreed to buy it. I work remotely so I got fiber internet installed and moved in permanently. Been there six years now. My girlfriend moved in last year. It's been perfect. We've made it our own, repainted, new furniture. It's not my parents house anymore. It's our home. My sister got engaged to her college boyfriend in 2,019. My parents agreed to pay for the wedding. Everything got pushed back and she rescheduled for this December. I even agreed to be in the bridal party. Then three weeks ago, she corners me at a family dinner. So where are you staying the two weeks after my wedding? I'm confused. What do you mean at my house? Her entire face changes this sour look. That's not going to work. Why not? Because that's where we're having our honeymoon, two weeks alone at the Lakehouse. We need privacy. I actually laugh because I think she's joking. She's not. That's literally the first time hearing of this. Mom and dad said it was fine. It's not their.

Mom and dad are letting you live there rent free. My brain breaks. What? They told me? They're letting you stay there since you work from home, that it's still their house. I email her the documents right there, the sale agreement, the eat everything. Check your email. I hear her typing. Then nothing. Silence for almost a minute. Why did they sell it? I could lie, but I'm done protecting everyone. To pay for your college. You didn't have savings. They didn't want you taking loans. So they sold the house and used my money to fund your education. More silence. How much? 180 k, 4 years of tuition, plus your apartment and meal plan. I can hear her breathing. They told me they'd been saving since I was born. They lied. She hangs up without saying goodbye. That was yesterday. Haven't heard from her since. But my parents, 15 missed calls, dozens of texts. I haven't answered any of them.

I told them about the time Karen told my boyfriend I was talking bad about him just because she thought it was funny. I told them about her taking my straightener to her apartment and keeping it for four months. I told them about the jacket, the good one I saved up for. She wore it to a party and got salsa on the sleeve and never got it cleaned. Dad asked why I never said anything, and I just stared at him. I said I did multiple times. He told me to work it out with her myself because we were adults. Mom said siblings fight and I needed to let things go. Karen acted like I was making a big deal out of nothing.

That fake thing she does where her voice gets high and she dabs at her eyes, but there's no actual tears. She said she didn't realize I was keeping track of everything, that she Thought we were just sharing stuff like sisters do. I said sharing is when both people agree. Stealing is when you take something without asking and then lie about it. Jan wrote that down on her little notepad. My mom finally spoke up and said maybe I was being too harsh. Family is supposed to forgive each other. I asked her if she would forgive someone who stole $2,000 from her and she didn't answer. I asked dad if he would let a co worker use his tools and break them and never replace them and just expect Tim to get over it. He said that was different. I asked how. Nobody had an answer for that. Karen said she would pay me back and I said she'd been saying that for six months. I told her I didn't want to hear it anymore. I wanted a payment plan and writing or I was filing a police report. Jan asked if that was really necessary and I said yeah it was cause I was done pretending this was okay. Jan tried to move us towards some kind of resolution. Asked if we could all agree on some steps moving forward. I said Karen pays me 50 bucks a month until the debt is gone and stays out of my stuff. No borrowing my car, no using my accounts, no coming into my apartment when I'm not there. She agreed, but she looked mad about it. Mom said she hoped this Meant we could all move past it and I said sure, once I get my money back we can move past it.

I'm coming with you. Partners support each other's careers. Like when you went to that Chicago marketing conference where spouses explicitly weren't invited. That's different. In Vegas, I posted nothing on social media. Saturday, Sophia posted a group photo from a rooftop mixer. About 30 people, me included. Jessica called 23 times while I was in a panel discussion. Her texts were unhinged. Who else is there? Why is she wearing that dress? I'm driving to Vegas. I called her back. Do not drive to Vegas. You're with her. I'm with 30 people at a professional event. She's more important than me. She's more professional. I hung up and turned off my phone. When I got home Sunday, the apartment was destroyed. Empty wine bottles, my clothes thrown everywhere. She was still in Friday's work clothes, clutching her phone. You ignored me all weekend. I was working. You're having an affair. I actually laughed. Jessica, this is literally what you asked for. You said I was too available, unattractive. You wanted Mystery Space, a man with his own life. I gave you exactly that. Not like this. Then how? Explain how I'm supposed to be less available but also completely available to you. It's about balance. No, It's about control. You wanted me to chase you, but you can't handle it when I actually have other priorities. She threw a wine glass at the wall. It shattered. Get out! He screamed. Jessica, this is my apartment. My name is on the lease. The look on her face was priceless. Then I'll leave. Okay. She blinked. Okay, that's it. You're drunk, violent, and deeply insecure. You created a problem that didn't exist, and now you're mad that your solution backfired. So, yeah, okay. She moved out three days later, posted on social media about surviving narcissistic abuse. Few months later, she still texts, occasionally. Long paragraphs about growth and mistakes. The last one said, you proved your point. You won. Are you happy I didn't reply?

We have nothing. And the only response is, relax, we'll figure it out. Sunday night, I didn't trust it, so I got to work on my own. Sunday night. Eleven PM, I'm putting final touches on the presentation I built alone when I get an email notification. It's from the professor, sent to the whole group by accident, clearly meant just for my three friends. Subject line, re concerns about team member. I open it and my blood runs cold. There's a whole email chain. My friends have been meeting with the professor for weeks, holding a case that I was the problem teammate. Screenshots of me micromanaging in the group chat claims I refuse to let them contribute. One of them even wrote, he just wants all the credit for himself because he's obsessed with his G P. A. We've been trying to work around him, but he won't let us access the files. But here's the part that makes my hands shake. Attached to the latest email is a separate presentation. Their own version, 20 slides of mediocre work, but it exists. They've been working together this whole time just without me. The Professor's response, I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. Let's discuss alternatives for your grade separate from his. Why would they do this? We've been friends for three years. I scroll back through the chain and find it, an email from week 1. If we tank his participation, Grade and do our own project. We can still pass and he'll be the one who fails. Then maybe he'll stop making the rest of us look bad in every class. Monday morning, I walked into that classroom with two USB drives. One had my complete project. The other had screenshots of every ignored message, every email, and their entire scheme. When the professor called us up to present, I plugged in drive No. 2 first. I didn't say a word, just let it project on the screen while the whole class read their plan to sabotage me. My three friends went pale. Then I switched to my actual presentation and delivered 20 minutes of flawless analysis. Professor stopped me after and asked to speak privately. I handed him both drives and said, I'll take my zero on the group portion. It's worth it. Two days later, I got an email. I'd failed the group project as expected, which dropped my final grade to a C. But attached was a letter of recommendation to Harvard's graduate program that started with, in my 20 years of teaching, I have never witnessed a student handle betrayal and adversity with such integrity and capability.

I thought things were good until I surprised her at work with her favorite Thai food. The look on her face wasn't happiness. It. It was annoyance. Her co workers smirked as we ate an awkward lunch in the break room. That night, she hit me with it while I was folding laundry. You're too available. It's unattractive. I stopped mid fold. What? You're always there, always texting, always checking in. It's suffocating. Women want men who are busy, who have their own lives. You answering my calls on the first ring? Not so much the irony. I run three properties and have plenty going on. But I made time for her because I thought that's what partners did. You're right. I said, I'll work on that. She smiled and kissed me.

I had a property viewing with Sophia, whose family trust was diversifying into commercial real estate. Completely professional. Toward three buildings, business, lunch. Back that evening, when Jessica called my office, my assistant Rachel answered, Mr. Wallace is in Miami with a client. That night, Jessica was waiting with wine and that fake Smile. Women do before going nuclear. How is Miami? Productive. Think we'll close on the Coral Gables property. Who is the client? Sophia Brennan. She's taking over her family's investment portfolio. Jessica immediately pulled out her phone to Instagram stock. Her face went through several emotions. She's. She's a child. She's 24 with a masters from Morton. Why didn't you tell me? I laughed. Jessica, you literally told me I was too available, that I should be mysterious. Now you're upset I didn't give you my daily itinerary. That's different. She couldn't answer when I asked how. The rules kept changing after that. Be less available, but not with attractive clients. Don't text constantly, but respond within an hour. Have your own life, but clear it with her first. I just kept doing what she originally asked. Focused on work, hit the gym, grabbed drinks with friends. The Miami trip was so successful that Sophia recommended me to two other clients. My business was booming. Meanwhile, Jessica was losing her mind, showing up at my office randomly with lunch, triple texting, going through my

My ex, Derek, thinks you're insecure. I want you to meet him. Show him you're not threatened. I should have seen it coming. Maya always needed to be pursued to be fought over. But I agreed because I'd already seen the Instagram DMs on her laptop three days earlier. Messages that made my stomach turn. Messages planning exactly this meeting. The trap wasn't hers, it was mine. And she had no idea. The bar was one of those pretentious places with exposed brick and eighteen dollar cocktails. Derek was already there, dressed like he was auditioning for a Cologne ad. He shook my hand with the grip of someone trying to crush walnuts. The next hour, I became a punching bag. He talked about their exotic vacations, their inside jokes, the way Maya used to be. More fun. Every jab landed while Maya giggled like she was watching her favorite comedian. You seem pretty quiet, Derek smirked. Maya always went for guys with more presents. She touched his arm, leaned in close. The Performance was masterful. I sat there, recording every second on the pen camera in my jacket pocket, playing the role of the insecure boyfriend who didn't know he was being humiliated. When Maya finally declared I'd passed her test, I just smiled, threw down cash for their drinks, and walked out. Their confusion was delicious. But the confusion was nothing compared to what came next.

She couldn't answer because there was no answer that didn't admit she wanted me to pine for her while she found herself.

Did uncle leave? Of course not. He and the mistress just started stealing electricity from the neighbors and collecting rainwater. I'm not kidding. They were basically camping in a house in the middle of Bogota. Rather than admitting defeat. Two more years of this, 2 years Dad's paying property taxes on a house he can't use, can't sell, can't even visit without dealing with his squatter brother. The legal case is moving nowhere. Uncle starting to tell people in the neighborhood that dad abandoned the house to live in El Norte. So now it's his. That's when dad finally snapped. He flew down to Colombia without telling anyone, hired some local guys to watch the house. For weeks, they monitored when uncle and the mistress would leave, their patterns, their schedule. Turns out every Thursday they'd go to the market in Palo Kamal and wouldn't come back until afternoon. One Thursday, Dad made the call. The demolition crew was already waiting. The moment Uncle's car disappeared down the road, they moved in. Excavator, bulldozer, the works. This wasn't some half hearted attempt. This was complete destruction. By the time uncle came back from the market, there was nothing left but rubble. The house our great grandfather built, the house where dad grew up, the house that had been in our family for generations, gone. Just a pile of bricks and twisted metal. Uncle called dad, screaming in Spanish, the broken English, then back to Spanish, threatening to Sue threatening to call the police, threatening to fly to Arizona and fight him. Dad's response? Sue me for what? Demolishing my own house? Good luck with that. And you can't afford a plane ticket to Phoenix anyway. And here's the beautiful part. Uncle couldn't do anything. The house was legally Dad's. All the paperwork was in Dad's name. Colombian law doesn't prevent you from demolishing your own property. Uncle wasn't a legal tenant. It was a squatter who dad had been trying to evict for years. Uncle tried going to the police, but what's he going to say? I was illegally living in my brother's house and he demolished it? They told him it was a civil matter and to get a lawyer. The mistress left him immediately. Turns out she was only with him for the free house in a nice neighborhood. No house, no mistress. The extended family was divided. The relatives in Columbia thought dad went too far. The relatives in the US understood why he did it.

He didn't expect what came next. My dad was born in Colombia but moved to Arizona in his late 20s for work. The family home back in Bogota was always supposed to go to my dad. My grandfather made that clear to everyone for years. It was in the will, discussed at family dinners. Everyone knew the deal. Then my grandfather got sick, really sick, kind, where he needed round the clock hair. My uncle, who had just been kicked out by his wife for cheating, suddenly volunteered to move in and take care of Grandpa. How convenient, right? Oh, and he brought his mistress with him. My dad wasn't thrilled about the mistress living in our family home, but he was in Phoenix, thousands of miles away. And honestly, having family take care of Grandpa seemed better than strangers or a nursing home. So dad let it slide. It's temporary, he told himself, just until Grandpa gets better or passes. Well, Grandpa passed away a few years later. The house officially became my dad's. Uncle was supposed to move out after the funeral. That was the agreement, except uncle apparently forgot how agreements work. A year passed, a full year. My dad finally called him from Arizona. Hermano, you need to move out or buy the house from me. Your choice. Uncle agreed to move, said he just needed a few months to find a place in Bogota. Those few Months came and went. Uncle was still there, still with the mistress, living rent free in my dad's house. Dad tried being reasonable. He offered to sell it to uncle at below market value. Property in that area of Bogota isn't cheap. Uncle said he'd think about it, then stopped answering WhatsApp messages about it. Dad tried the legal route, hired a lawyer in Colombia, started eviction proceedings. But if you know anything about the Colombian legal system, you know it moves incredibly slowly. We're talking years just to get a court date. Meanwhile, Uncle's living it up in the house like he owns it. So dad got creative. He was still paying all the utilities from Arizona, water, electricity, gas, have been paying them the entire time through his Colombian bank account, even when Grandpa was alive. So he cut them off.

I treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7 a M, could you drop off my work laptop? Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office. Monday. Can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans. Monday works better. She didn't like that. But what was she gonna say? We are just friends now. Week 2, Tara started cracking. She showed up at the apartment while I was at work. Still using her key. Helped herself to groceries, did laundry, took a shower. I texted her. I'll need the key back. My friends don't have keys to my place. This is ridiculous. We live together. We used to live together. Now we're friends. Different relationship, different boundaries. She came by that evening, furious. You changed the locks. You no longer live here. Here's a box of your stuff. I'm treating you exactly like I treat my friends. None of them have keys to my place. But I'm not just any friend. According to you, that's exactly what you are. The real kicker came at game night with our friend group. I showed up solo. She showed up with some dude named Connor from yoga.

The company is in trouble. Then Clara should fix it. He's not qualified. We made a mistake. He wants to talk about your role. I met them for dinner. Dad offered CO CEO equal partnership. I pulled out an envelope, placed it on the table. My resignation. Effective three weeks from today. I've accepted a position with Harrington Development as their chief operations officer. Silence. Total silence. Dad's face went white. You're going to our biggest client. Alexander made me an offer I couldn't refuse. Full executive authority, ownership, stake recognition from day one. You're abandoning your family. Clara whispered. No. You abandoned me when you decided I was only good enough to work behind the scenes. Dad stood. Rage replacing shock. If you walk out now, don't expect to be welcomed back. I'm not your enemy, dad. I'm just not your safety net anymore. I drove away feeling lighter than I had in years.

My ten year old son came home confused because his history teacher told the class that the Great Wall of China is visible from space with the naked eye. My son Alex has always been fascinated by space. Since he was five. We've spent countless nights stargazing with our telescope. He knows all the planets and can recite facts about the International Space Station. Last year I bought him a book signed by Chris Hadfield, the famous astronaut. Alex treasures it and can quote entire passages about what earth actually looks like from space. But everything changed when Mister Peterson started teaching history. During a lesson about ancient wonders told the class that the Great Wall of China is the only man made structure visible from space with the naked eye. Alex raised his hand and explained that astronauts have confirmed this isn't true. The wall is too narrow and blends with the landscape. He mentioned that Hadfield specifically addressed this myth in his book. Mister Peterson cut him off. That's nonsense, he said. It's in our textbook and I've been teaching this fact for 20 years. Your little astronaut book is wrong. The next day, Alex brought in his signed book to show the passage. Instead of listening, Mister Peterson confiscated it calling it disruptive material. He made Alex stand in front of the class and recite the Great Wall of China is visible from space. 10 times. When Alex came home, he was devastated. His precious signed book was gone and he felt humiliated. Mister Peterson had assigned a five page essay on the importance of respecting teachers knowledge. As punishment. I was furious. I emailed Mister Peterson explaining the facts and asking for the book back. His response I don't need space facts from a parent. The curriculum says the wall is visible from space, so that's what I teach. The principal seemed reluctant to contradict a ten year teacher over what she called a minor factual dispute. That's when I decided to take action. My college roommate

The cop looked at the man, his key work. The man nodded, yeah, we bought this last month. Previous owner said the locks were new. The cop turned to me. These buildings identical. I nodded, exact same doors, same numbers, same layout. Almost did this before or. The younger cop looked at the couple. Change your locks when you move in.

You can defend your home, but once you know it's a mistake, you can't keep attacking. Get your locks changed tomorrow. The cop look to me. You okay? Need medical? I touched my head, small bump. I'm fine. The cop walked me outside to the red door building. Next door looked exactly the same except the door color. I unlocked my door, my fabric couch, my small TV, everything where I left It he handed me his card. Change your locks, document any injuries. I nodded, closed the door, sat down, hands shaking, phone cracked, but still working. Texted my supervisor I'd be late. I couldn't sleep. Kept seeing that bat swinging at me. Next morning I called a locksmith. He came that afternoon. While installing the new lock, he said you're the third person this month from this complex. Filder used the same key pattern for multiple buildings. I stared at him. Third person? He nodded, yeah. Another nurse two weeks ago, same exact thing. Family attacked her. It's a lawsuit waiting to happen. He finished. Two hundred dollars I paid, walked to the complex. Office manager wasn't there, left a detailed note about the lock issue. They never responded. A week later, I saw the couple in the parking lot. They saw me, turned around fast, walked away. I submitted my 60 day notice that afternoon. Some mistakes aren't worth cheap rent. The real mistake was the complex using identical locks on different buildings.

I walked away, joined our biggest client and watch the firm that ignored me collapse without me. Clara will be taking over as CEO when I retire next year. The conference room went silent. Leather chairs, mahogany table, smell of coffee going cold. I stared at my father across the table. 14 years I given this company 14 years. What about me? The words slipped out before I could stop them. Dad cleared his throat. You'll stay on as operations manager. Your role is secure. My sister Clara smiled, sympathetic but triumphant. She'd worked here one year. One year versus my 14. Clara has vision, dad continued. She's better with people. You're brilliant with operations. But, but I'm not CEO material. I finished for him. Mom leaned forward. You're crucial to the company, darling. Behind the scenes, behind the scenes where I'd always been, Clara reached for my hands. We'll be unstoppable together. Ethan, you know operations. I'll bring in clients. I pulled away. Congratulations. Then I left. That night, I sat on my balcony with whiskey. Downtown stretched below, buildings we'd constructed, including Harrington Tower, our biggest project, my project from the first bid to the final beam. Dad had been the face of presentations, but the content was mine. I'd worked 70 hour weeks for years, holidays on job sites, relationships sacrificed, all because I thought the company would be mine one day. What a fool. I made a Decision then. No more 70 hour weeks. No more emergency calls. No more sacrificing my life, work 8 to 5, nothing more. The next morning I arrived at 8:00am sharp, an hour later than usual. Clara appeared at my door at noon ready for lunch. Can't I have plans? We need to discuss the transition. Nothing to discuss. CEO, I'm operations. Business as usual. She frowned. Dad said you haven't reviewed the West Ridge bid. Not on my calendar this week. It's due Friday. I shrugged. Someone should have scheduled me with proper notice. I'm sure you can handle it. You're better with clients after all. She left angry. At five PM I shut down my computer and walked out. Didn't check for emergencies, just left. The West Ridge bid went out without my review. We lost a rookie mistake in materials estimation. Dad called me in face red. We lost West Ridge because of an error you would have caught. That's unfortunate, I said calmly. Clara was handling that bid. She needed your expertise.

Elena would be gone until 7, mom and dad until six. Car sat in the driveway, gleaming white under the afternoon. Sunday. Three years of payments, insurance, registration. All mine. I unlocked it, drove away. The interior reeked of stale fries and cheap air freshener. Fast food wrappers and lipstick tubes covered the seats. I parked it outside my apartment and sent one text to the group chat. I've retrieved my car. Elena can arrange alternate transportation. Then I muted the conversation and went to the gym. When I came back, my phone was melting down. Hundreds of new messages. I'd been removed and re added three times before they realised they needed me in there to scream at. Mom's voicemails were sobbing apologies. Dad threatened to call the police. Elena was posting on Facebook about toxic, narcissistic family members. I scrolled through it all with detached calm. They told me to stay away forever. Now they were furious because I had. I opened the group chat one last time. Typed slowly, carefully. You told me to stay away forever. I'm just making sure you don't need me for anything. The house will be sold when dad can't refinance. The truck will be repossessed unless he finds a new guarantor. Mom's kitchen loan I'm stopping payments tomorrow. You wanted me out of the family. Congratulations. You're finally financially independent. Then I attached screenshots. Every loan, every payment, every text asking for money, every insult. Every time they'd called me selfish. 32 years of receipts. I hit send. Silence. Then the panic began. Mom, Sophie, please, dad, we didn't mean it like that. Elena, you can't do this to us. I watched the messages flood in desperation, stacking on itself. I typed one final line. You said I wasn't family, so I'm acting like it. Then I left the group chat. Blocked them all. Set my phone face down on the counter, poured a glass of wine. Outside, city lights blinked against the dark window. My phone kept buzzing. Small, frantic tremors of panic I'd never hear. I raised my glass to my reflection and smiled.

The mother's story was confirmed by the child. Full custody awarded to mother. My heart dropped, realizing mom had coached me to lie to the judge. I didn't know what to do, so I called my Aunt Patricia, even though mom said she hated us, and told her what I'd found. Your mom told us you confessed. Patricia gasped. She said you were dangerous and we couldn't visit. She immediately called my dad. The court gave her a restraining order because she said I would hurt you for hurting him. He sobbed. Pat, Trisha called everyone in my family and arranged for everyone to be at my house when my mom got home from work. When mom got home, she saw the whole family sitting there with a medical document spread across the coffee table. We know what really happened to Levi. Grandma said gently. It was an accident. You didn't know he was allergic. Mom's face twisted into something terrifying. No, she did it. I saw her do it. Dad stepped out from the hallway with a doctor's report. You gave him peanut butter? It was an accident. You've been sick since it happened. Mom started laughing hysterically, then screaming, then crying all at once. I can't be the one who did it. If it's true, then I'm a monster. She is the monster, not me! She grabbed my shoulders hard enough to leave bruises. You did It. Please just say you did it. Tell them you gave him the peanuts. She was shaking me violently. Mom, you know I didn't, I whispered. She completely shattered. I gave him the sandwich. I gave my baby the thing that took him. She collapsed on the floor, screaming it was me over and over while grandma called 9 1 1. It hurt too much, so I made her responsible instead. I ruined both my children. And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. But I couldn't live with it. The paramedics had to sedate her because she kept trying to hurt herself. They took her to the mental hospital while I stood there frozen, trying to understand that I'd never actually killed anyone. Dad drove me to his apartment and held me while I cried. It was never your fault, he kept repeating. Mom went away for six months to get help. And I started trying to figure out how to be a normal kid who didn't wake up thinking they were a killer.

Good morning, killer, my mother said from my doorway, her eyes red and swollen like they've been for four years. I was 13 now, but she'd been doing this since I was 9 when my baby brother Levi died. Every morning, she'd stand there shaking and demand I repeat the story she created. I would, jealous, and I gave him something bad, I'd recite. You took him from us because you're evil and selfish, and I'll never forgive you, she'd say, then start sobbing uncontrollably. She made me write apology letters to him every week and read them at his grave while she wailed and told other families to keep their children away from me. Even your father couldn't stand what you did. She'd cry whenever I asked about dad. She told my teachers I was dangerous and needed constant watching because I'd killed once and might do it again. My cousins weren't allowed near me, and nobody would sit next to me at Thanksgiving. My therapist said blocked memories meant something was wrong with the story. So when mom went to work, I searched the house for answers. I tore through the house until I found a sealed envelope hidden in the back of the filing cabinet that said confidential across the front. My hands shook as I peeled back the tape and pulled out Levi's autopsy report. It said Levi died From a severe allergic reaction to peanuts that made his throat close up. I started reading the investigators notes and suddenly I couldn't breathe. Mother gave the child a peanut butter sandwich at twelve o eight PM. No prior knowledge of peanut allergy. Father at work, daughter at school. Tragic accident. There were hospital records showing my mom's complete mental breakdown when they told her Levi died from the sandwich she gave him. The doctor wrote mother cannot accept reality and has created a false story to cope with unbearable guilt. I found Dad's old custody.

She stuck her head out the door and yelled down the hallway, Missus Davidson, get in here now! Missus Davidson came rushing in, eating a granola bar. What's she. She looked at me, and the granola bar fell right out of her hand onto the floor. Oh, my god. We need to call her mother right now.

Doctor Peterson brought us into an exam room and locked the door. He examined my face under the brightest light with a magnifying glass. He looked at my eyelashes without saying anything. Then he asked mom to step outside. Through the door, I could hear him talking low and serious. Mom made a sound like a sob. When she came back in, her eyes were all red.

I just want to know what's wrong with my eyelashes. I started crying. Mom was crying, too. Doctor Peterson made a phone call using words like immediate referral and protocol for these situations. He gave us a card for another doctor across town who we had to see that same afternoon. The new doctor's Office was different. There was a police officer in the waiting room.

My professor drops the bomb three weeks before finals that the group project is worth 70% of our grade and we get to pick our own teams. My three best friends since freshman year immediately swore me like, obviously we're together, right? And honestly, I'm pumped because we always crush projects together. Professor hands us this massive case study about restructuring a failing tech company and says it needs a 30 page analysis plus a 20 minute presentation. I'm already mentally dividing the work when my friend goes, you're so good at this stuff, you should take the lead. And the other two are nodding like bobbleheads. I figure, okay, I'll coordinate everything, assign sections based on everyone's strengths, set up our Google Drive, you know, actual leader stuff. We make this whole show about being the dream team. And the professor even smiles at us saying, this should be interesting. The assignment packet is thick as a textbook and I'm already highlighting key sections. That night I create a group chat and mention our first meeting tomorrow at the library. Everyone confirms first meeting. Nobody shows up. I sit there for two hours with my color coded notes and structured timeline while they're posting Instagram stories from some party. I text the group, where are you guys? And get back. Sorry, emergency came up. You got this though. Next day in class, they're literally sitting three rows Behind me, whispering and laughing. And when I turn around, they wave like nothing happened. Second meeting attempt. One friend shows up 45 minutes late just to tell me she has to leave for her boyfriend's thing, but email me what I need to do. I created this detailed spreadsheet with everyone's parts, deadlines, research sources, and I get crickets. We too. I head over to eat lunch with them. And over here, why is he being such a try hard about this problem? It's not that deep. And another goes classic bookworm behaviour. I confront them after class. Like, are you guys going to help on the final or not? And they're suddenly all concerned and serious faces. Of course, we're working on it. Stop stressing. But then I see them at the professor's office hours without me. Later, the professor even pulls me aside and says, your teammates mentioned you haven't been responding to their attempts to collaborate. That doesn't sound like you. My stomach drops. I show him my phone, the ignored messages, the empty shared documents, and he just nods but says, try to work it out. Group dynamics are part of the grade. A week before the presentation, I check our shared drive. One person uploaded a single paragraph that's literally copy and pasted from Wikipedia.

My sister liked it. I replied, I'll stop paying tomorrow. By midnight, they were screaming and panicking in the group chat. The text came during my lunch break. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead. Someone's fish reheated in the microwave. My phone buzzed. Dad's name on the screen. We've decided to end all contact. Stay away from us forever. I read it twice. No explanation, no preamble, just exile from the family I'd carried for 32 years. Then another buzz. Elena liked the message, my sister, the golden child. She reacted to my eraser with a thumbs up emoji. I stared at that little blue thumb. My hands shook. For 32 years, I've been the reliable one. While Elena party through college on mom and Dad's money, I worked two jobs to pay my tuition. When mom wanted to refinance the house for a European vacation, I co signed because my credit was perfect and theirs was destroyed. When dad leased a truck he couldn't afford, I guaranteed the loan. When Elena totalled her third car, I signed as the primary borrower because her credit was so bad no one else would. I carried all of it. House refinance, truck lease, Elena's car, Mom's kitchen remodel loan, 18,000 in my name. She'd made three payments before the excuses started and now this. I didn't think. I just typed, I'll stop paying for everything tomorrow. Then I turned off my phone, finished lunch and went back. To work. When I powered it back on during the drive home, it buzzed like a live wire. The family group chat was exploding. Mom, Sophie, are you serious right now? Dad, how could you threaten us like this? Elena, you're literally trying to destroy us. Elena, I need my car. I have a job. I almost laughed. Elena had called in sick more times than she'd worked full shifts at her boutique job. I didn't respond. Instead, I opened my banking app, started documenting everything. The next morning, coffee steaming beside me, I sat at my kitchen table with my laptop and a legal pad of notes. First, call the mortgage lender. I asked to be removed from the refinance. If dad couldn't qualify alone, the house would have to be sold. Next, the truck lease certified letter to the dealership withdrawing as Garrentor.

I went to our front door and opened it. Then I pulled out my phone and called my mom. She answered on the second ring. Hey, honey, what's up? Logan's here. He let himself in without asking and he's refusing to leave. I could hear her sigh. Well, he's your brother. He just needs some help getting back on his feet. He disrespected Iris in her own home. He's acting like he owns the place. Oh, don't be dramatic. He's just going through a transition. You have the space. It's only temporary. I looked over at Logan sprawled on our couch, remote in hand, eating our food. Mom, I'm giving him three more minutes to leave. If he doesn't, I'm calling the police. She went quiet. Then her voice got sharp. You would call the cops on your own brother after everything he sacrificed. He has three minutes. I hung up. Logan glanced over at me but didn't move. He took another bite of the eggs he'd made with our groceries and kept watching TV. Two minutes passed. Logan adjusted the pillow behind his head. I dialed non emergency and put it on speaker. The operator answered. I explained the situation. Someone with a key to my home refusing to leave after being asked. She, he said an officer could be there in about 20 minutes. I thanked her and hung up. Logan finally stood up. His face was red now. You actually called the cops on me. You have 18 minutes before they get here. He grabbed his duffle bag and started shoving his clothes back in. The whole time, he was muttering under his breath something about how he risked his life and this is how he gets treated. When he got to the door, he turned around. Mom's gonna hear about this. I'm sure she will. He walked out and slammed the door so hard, the picture frame in our hallway shook. I locked the dead bolt. Then I went to the bedroom. Iris was sitting on the bed. I sat down next to her and she just leaned her head on my shoulder. Thank you, she said quietly. My mom called me 17 times that day. I didn't answer. Logan texted me later that night saying I'd regret this. I blocked his number.

Liam stands up looking absolutely destroyed. He's staring at the paper in Minnie's hands like his whole world just ended. Minnie's got tears running down her face, playing the victim perfectly. But then my Aunt Dana, who's a nurse, walks over and grabs the paper from Minnie's hand. She studies it maybe 10 seconds, then starts laughing, like actually laughing. This is completely fake, Dana says loudly. I've worked in genetic testing for 15 years. This lab doesn't exist. The formatting is wrong. The reference numbers don't follow any real system. This is photoshopped. The color drains from Minnie's face, and she tries to grab the paper back, but Dana holds it up. You can literally see where she edited the names. The font doesn't even match. Gabriel is pulling up a supposed lab on his phone. There's no genetics lab with this name in the entire state, he says. Liam looks at Minnie with this of complete betrayal. You made this up. Why would you do this? Minnie's crying harder now, but they're not sympathetic tears anymore. She looks cornered. I just, I thought you thought you destroy my marriage. I finally find my voice at my baby shower in front of everyone. My dad, who barely ever yells, stands up and tells Minnie to leave. She's begging, saying she didn't mean it. She just wanted attention. Mom's crying now, too, but from anger. And embarrassment. Liam walks out without saying another word to her. He filed for divorce three days later. In the papers, he. I did the fake paternity test as evidence of emotional abuse and deception. My parents didn't speak to mini for 6 months. Most of the family cut her off completely. Her friends from the neighborhood stopped inviting her to things. She lost basically everyone. I gave birth to a healthy baby girl two months later. Mini sent a gift, but we returned it. Liam got full custody of Aurora after the divorce. Turns out the judge didn't take kindly to someone who take a paternity test as a manipulation tactic. Last I heard, mini move three states away. Mom sends her money sometimes because she feels guilty. But even that relationship is basically destroyed. Minnie's never met my daughter. Gabriel doesn't even want to hear her name.

Five years later, at my cousin's wedding, they finally understood what they'd lost. I stood alone in my cap and gown on MIT's lawn in May 2018, scanning the crowd for faces I knew wouldn't be there. My phone buzzed. Mom's text. Sweetie, Madison's recital got moved to today. We'll make it up to you. Congratulations. 22 years old. Suma Kumlaude in computer engineering. Completely alone that evening, she called, voice bubbling with excitement. Madison was absolutely breathtaking. Everyone said she was the star. How was your little ceremony? My little ceremony? Four years of sleepless nights. Breakthrough in semiconductor design with actual patent potential. But it was my little ceremony. While Madison's Community Theatre Ballet recital was the event of the year, something inside me cracked. It was fine, mom. Oh, good. Do you want me to send you the video? I hung up. Then I blocked both their numbers, changed my email, disappeared completely. Through my uncle Robert, I heard fragments. They didn't even realize I was seriously upset for three weeks. She'll come around, my father said. Sarah's always been Moody. But I didn't come around. I took a position at a tech company in Seattle, 3,000 miles from Richmond, Virginia. The salary was ridiculous. More than my parents made combined. What? They didn't know the company CEO had read my thesis. He'd flown to MIT specifically to recruit me. I threw myself into work, into Building a life where my achievements actually mattered. Five years passed. I got promoted twice. By 27, I was a senior engineer with my name on three patents. Bought an apartment overlooking Puget Sound. Then the biggest twist. My semiconductor design became the foundation for a product worth $40 million. My parents never knew because they never asked. I built a life that was entirely, completely mine. Then my cousin Derek's wedding invitation arrived. I showed up in a navy dress that cost more than my parents monthly mortgage. Drove a rented Tesla. I'd become someone they wouldn't recognize. The ceremony was beautiful. At the reception, my mother appeared at my elbow. Sarah, is that really you? Hi, mom.

My brother Logan, served 8 years in the Marines, came back with this attitude like everyone owed him something. My wife, Iris, and I had been married for six months when he showed up unannounced one Saturday morning. I was still in my boxers making coffee when I heard the door unlock. Logan had a key from when he'd stayed with us during his transition out. He just walked in, boots still on, dropped his duffel bag in our living room. Iris came out of the bedroom in her robe. Logan didn't even acknowledge her, opened our fridge and started making himself breakfast. I asked what he was doing here. He said he needed a place to crash for a few weeks while he figured things out. Didn't ask. Just told me. Iris looked at me, then went back to the bedroom without saying anything. Logan noticed you got a problem with me being here. I put my coffee down. You didn't knock. You didn't call. You didn't ask. He laughed. It's family. I don't need permission. I walked over and held out my hand key. Now his smile dropped. You serious? You, you wanna stay here? You ask first. You knock. You respect that this is Iris's home, too, or you can figure it out somewhere else. Just stared at me. Then he started unpacking his duffle bag right there on our Couch, pulled out a hoodie, some jeans, laid them across our furniture like he was moving in permanently. I'm not leaving, he said. You're my brother. You don't turn away, family. I looked at Iris standing in the hallway. She had her arms crossed watching this whole thing play out. I could see it in her face. He wasn't going to say anything, but she was done. I turned back to Logan, pack your stuff. You've got five minutes. He laughed again, or what? You're gonna throw me out? Mom would love that. Her son who served his country getting kicked to the curb by his ungrateful brother. I didn't a move, just stood there. Logan kept going, you know how many guys I served with would kill to have family help them out? And you're really gonna do this over some disrespect nonsense. Four minutes. He shook his head, sat down on our couch and turned on our TV, found some college football game and cranked the volume up.

Her husband immediately divorced her and she was then shunned by the entire family. Minnie and I are only a year apart, but growing up, she made it clear she hated me. She'd tell me constantly how jealous she was, how much she resented me. I tried so hard to be close with her because she was my only sibling, but she'd push me away every time when she was in a good mood. She was amazing, creative, funny, the best sister. But the second we argued, she'd get violent, punching me, pulling my hair, pushing me downstairs. My parents would scold her since she was older, but it never stopped. The worst part was how she sabotaged my relationships. I dated this guy, Carter, for four months. Things were getting serious. We were about to meet each other's parents. Then one night he blocked me everywhere, phone, social media, everything. I showed up at his house confused and he told me many had messaged him. She told him I was cheating, sending inappropriate pictures to other guys. All these horrible lies. He didn't want to date someone with a sister like that. I confronted Minnie and she admitted she did it because she thought I was too good for him. After that, I knew I had to get away from her. I worked hard, got a scholarship, moved abroad for university. On my last night home, she actually apologized for everything. I forgave her because I just wanted peace. Years pass. I lose weight, find myself, build a career. I meet Gabriel and fall in love. When I got engaged, Minnie suddenly announces she's pregnant, trying to steal attention at my engagement party. Classic Minnie. I didn't care, though. I was genuinely happy for her and Liam. Fast forward two years. I'm seven months pregnant with my first baby. Mom throws me this beautiful shower at her house, pink decorations everywhere, about 30 people, all our family and close friends. Everything's perfect. We're halfway through opening gifts when he stands up holding this vanilla envelope. She's got this weird look on her face like she's nervous but also excited. Everyone, I have something really important to share, she announces. The room goes quiet. Liam, her husband, looks completely confused. He clearly has no idea what's happening. Minnie opens the envelope with shaking hands and pulls out what looks like official documents. I recently took a paternity test, he says, voice trembling. And I discovered that Liam isn't actually Aurora's biological father. My heart stops. Aurora is her two year old daughter. Everyone's staring now, completely silent. Liam's face has gone white. Then Minnie looks directly at me and Gabriel. The real father is Gabriel. The room explodes. People are gasping. My mom drops her wine glass. Gabriel jumps up shouting, what the hell are you talking about?

The classroom went completely silent, 20 pairs of eyes locked onto me. What do you mean? I managed to say, but my voice came out cracked. Missus Haskins crouched down next to my desk, something she never did. Sweetie, I'm asking if you feel safe at home. You can tell me anything. I swallowed nervously. Around me, kids were nodding like they knew something I didn't. Leah, who threw my backpack in a puddle last month, whispered, it's okay to tell the truth. Dev, who'd never spoken to me in two years, slid his unopened skittles onto my desk. You can have these, bro. At lunch, it got worse. The cafeteria lady gave me extra chicken tenders. Three different kids offered their desserts. Even Jace, who once panted me in the gym, patted my shoulder and said, stay strong, dude. Everyone was treating me like I was about to shatter. By last period, I was starting to get paranoid. Did someone start a rumor about me? Was this some elaborate prank? Pulled out my phone under my desk and checked Instagram, Snapchat, our class group chat. Nothing. No posts about me, no messages. Then it hit me. This morning I'd forgotten to take out the trash again and my mom had completely lost it. She'd yanked me out of bed at 5:00am and screamed at me for 20 minutes. And She grabbed the wooden spoon from the kitchen and made me hold out my hands. She slammed it down repeatedly until my palms were completely swollen. And then she slammed it down twice more just for good measure. That had left scars which were only covered thanks to my oversized hoodie. Mom doing this wasn't just normal. It was almost routine. But that couldn't be why everyone was acting weird. Nobody knew about that. Mom had warned me that if anyone ever found out, they'd take her away. I didn't want to lose my mom forever, so I'd made sure to keep it a secret. During second period, I'd reached for my pencil and my sleeve rolled up for just a second. I yanked it back down immediately. But Missus Haskins had been walking past my desk right at that moment. Did she see the scars? Is that why everyone was being so weird to me? With 10 minutes left in class, I couldn't take it anymore. I walked up to Missus Haskins desk. I'm fine, I said quietly. Whatever you think you saw this morning, I just fell off my bike yesterday. That's all. I'm really clumsy. Missus Haskins put down her pen and looked at me with the saddest eyes I've ever seen.

Liam told the planner they're taking the yacht tomorrow for an after party cruise. He already gave them the Marina code. My blood went cold. He'd somehow gotten my security code. I walked straight to him. You're not taking it, he leaned in. You're really going to do this here? I don't care how it looks. You've got everything, he hissed. All I wanted was one week. And. And before I could respond, his hand shot out. The slap echoed across the room. Glasses froze. Conversations died. The humiliation hit harder than the sting. Then and an older Man stood up. That's enough, he said. You've crossed the line. He walked toward us. For anyone wondering, I'm Judge Harold Miller and what I just witnessed was assault. The air left the. Liam stammered. It was just not another word. The judge cut him off, laying a hand on him. In front of witnesses, that's something else entirely. Liam's face crumbled. Months later, he sued me for emotional distress. Judge Miller dismissed it immediately, frivolous and baseless. Then Liam pitched a partnership, Everett Luxury Charters. I played along long enough to trademark the name myself. When he announced it at a charity gala, I took the mic. Just to be clear, I said, any use of that name is unauthorized. He stood there frozen. Tessa left him. His company collapsed and me. I finally understood that revenge doesn't come from anger. It comes from knowing your own work.

Her smile cracked. What's this? Divorce papers? Her face drained. You're kidding? Nope. She picked them up, hands shaking. You're divorcing me. I leaned against the counter, arms crossed. I'm not interested in being your second choice. Her shock twisted into anger. Second choice? That's not what this is. I was confused. I needed time. You needed to test drive the neighbor. I cut in. You left me to see if the grass was greener. Now it's not and you're back. Do you really think I'm just going to take you in like nothing happened? Her lips trembled. She tried again. We have history, Mike. We can fix this. No, I said, my voice steady. We can't. For a moment she looked like she might collapse. Then the tears came fast and messy. You're throwing away everything over one mistake. I shook my head, no, you did. The screen door creaked. I glanced over her shoulder. Jake stood on the porch frozen. He'd heard everything. His face dropped and he turned back down the steps without a word. Laura whipped around, humiliated and stormed out after him, dragging her suitcase. The paper stayed on the table waiting for her signature. By the next morning, the neighborhood was alive with whispers. Words spread fast. Laura chasing Jake while I handed her divorce papers. At the grocery store, two women stopped mid conversation when I walked past their Eyes darting, mouths clamped shut. At the gas station, neighbor muttered, good for you, man, before pumping his gas in silence. Later that week, I caught Jake alone. He couldn't even look me in the eye, just mumbled something about not meaning for it to get this far before retreating like a whipped dog. I didn't answer, didn't need to. I. I stood in the silence of my kitchen that night, papers on the table, house finally quiet again. No sadness, no regret, just relief. And that was the last gift she ever gave me.

I filed for divorce. She tried to fix it, but I'm not a backup. Laura sat across from me at the kitchen table, still in her pajamas, twisting her phone in her hands. We need to talk, he said. Those four words never mean anything good. She looked me dead in the eye and said, I think I have feelings for Jake. Jake, the neighbor? The shirtless trainer, always mowing his lawn, always laughing with her by the fence. First I thought I misheard. Then she kept going. I don't know what I want. I love you, but I need to figure this out. I was thinking maybe I could spend some time with him. A month. If it doesn't work, then we can focus on us. I stared at her. You're serious? She nodded, nervous but determined. Inside, something in me snapped. But outside, I just leaned back and said, if that's what you need. She left three days later with a duffel bag. No tears, no goodbye. Just a shrug and I'll be back. The silence after the door shut was louder than anything I'd ever heard. The month was easy. Easier than I thought it'd be. No nagging, no fake smiles over dinner. Just peace. I worked late, hit the gym, came home to a quiet house that finally felt like mine. I grilled steaks on the porch, had a beer with a buddy, slept like A rock for the first time in years. Meanwhile, the neighborhood buzzed. Curtains twitched when I came outside. Jake and Laura jogged past together, laughing too loud, his hand brushing her lower back like he was showing off at the store. I caught whispers, pity in their eyes when they glanced at me, smug curiosity when they looked at her. By the end of week one, I'd already met with a lawyer. The divorce papers sat on my counter, neatly folded, waiting. By week four, my phone buzzed her. I'll be home tomorrow. We should talk. She walked back in like she'd been on vacation, hair done, suitcase rolling behind her. Hey, she said, dropping her bag by the door. I'm back. I barely looked up from the couch. Welcome back. She blinked, confused by my flatness. Then she tried her speech. I realized some things. Jake's not what I need. He's fun, but immature. I want us. We can rebuild. She reached for my arm like she was offering me a gift.

He'd been alone for years after divorcing my mom and I wanted him to have some peace. His new wife, Denise, seemed lovely, sweet smile, kind words, always calling me sweetheart. I thought she was genuine. That didn't last long. Within a month, she started acting like she ran the place, my dad's house. Actually, our house wasn't something she just walked into after my mom left. The place was falling apart. Dad couldn't afford to fix anything. So after college, I moved back in. I paid half the mortgage for three years and covered nearly all the renovation costs. Because of that, my name is on the deed, 50, 50 ownership. But Denise didn't know that. She assumed it was all my dad's. And at first, I didn't correct her. I thought it didn't matter. She kept saying things like, we'll change these curtains or once my furniture arrives. It annoyed me, but I let it go. Then she started replacing things I had personally paid for, the kitchen table I refinished, the couch I bought without even asking. Then came her house rules. She told me not to just come in whenever I had to knock in my own house. He even said I should text before visiting. I tried to stay calm, but one afternoon when I stopped by to grab some tools, my key didn't work. She changed the locks. When I called my dad, he Sounded guilty but said it was for privacy since they were newlyweds. I reminded him that legally he couldn't do that without my consent. He sighed and said, please don't make this difficult. So I didn't argue. I just started planning. I reached out to the property management firm I use for my rental apartment and had them draft a co ownership notice. It basically said that no repairs, changes or new locks could happen without both owners agreeing. I had it mailed to my dad and Denise. It caused chaos. Dad called me two hours later. Apparently Denise had gone ballistic. She found out I was a co owner and accused him of lying to her. Turns out she thought she was marrying into a fully paid off house. She had no idea that my contributions had kept the place from foreclosure. That night she sent me a long message accusing me of being manipulative for not telling her.

Mom didn't look up. It's their choice, sweetheart. Their choice, I yelled. I'm your son. Defend me. Dad walked in still whining. Huh? Maybe if you acted mature, this wouldn't have happened. Acted mature. I literally helped both of them plan their weddings exactly how they wanted. If I'd refused, dad would have said the same thing. Act sure. That's when I realized something. I simply stopped talking and walked out. Mom asked where I was going, but this time I didn't reply. When it was my time to be married, my family acted like they didn't even exist. I hadn't spoken to them in two years and they never tried reaching out either. Then a month before my wedding, they found out through a mutual friend. All four of them showed up at my apartment unannounced, pounding on the door. My fiance stood beside me as I opened it. Vanessa's face was bed with rage. You're getting married and didn't tell us. That's right, I said calmly. Sean pushed forward. Where's our invitation? You weren't invited, I said, meeting each of their eyes. You understand, right? We had to keep it small. Mom started crying. Performative tears I'd seen before. We're your family. No, I said, my voice rising. Family shows up. Family includes each other. You made it clear I wasn't really family when it mattered to you. Dad's face turned purple. This is childish. Revenge, revenge, I shouted. I spent months planning their Weddings. I was their free labor. And you all laughed when they excluded me. Vanessa tried playing victim. You're really going to do this, not invite your own siblings? You mean like you did to me, I asked. John stepped forward aggressively. You're going to regret this. Regret what? I interrupted. Being excluded, being told I don't matter. I've already lived that thanks to all of you. Mom wailed. How could you do this to us the same way you did it to me? I said, it's my wedding, my choice. Isn't that what you told me? Dad pointed his finger at me. If you do this, you're out of the family. I actually smiled. Dad, I've been not of the family since I was born. You just never told me. My fiance stepped forward. You need to leave now or we're calling the police. Vanessa screamed. You'll regret this, as they left.

I text desperately, presentation is Monday. We have nothing. And the only response is, relax, we'll figure it out. Sunday night, I didn't trust it, so I got to work on my own. Sunday night. Eleven PM, I'm putting final touches on the presentation I built alone when I get an email notification from the professor sent to the whole group by accident, clearly meant just for my 3 friends. Subject line, re concerns about team member. I open it and my blood runs cold. There's a whole email chain. My friends have been meeting with the professor for weeks, building a case that I was the problem teammate. Screenshots of me micromanaging in the group chat claims I refused to let them contribute. One of them even wrote, he just wants all the credit for himself because he's obsessed with his g P a. We've been trying to work around him, but he won't let us access the files. But here's the part that makes my hands shake. Attached to the latest email is a separate presentation. Their own version, 20 slides of mediocre work, but it exists. They've been working together this whole time just without me. The professor's response, I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. Let's discuss alternatives for your grade separate from his. Why would they do this? We've been friends for three years. I scroll back through the chain. And find it an email from week one. If we tank his participation grade and do our own project, we can still pass and he'll be the one who fails. Then maybe he'll stop making the rest of us look bad in every class. Monday morning, I walked into that classroom with two USB drives. One had my complete project. The other had screenshots of every ignored message, every email, and their entire scheme. When the professor called us up to present, I plugged in drive No. 2 first. I didn't say a word, just let it project on the screen while the whole class read their plan to sabotage me. My three friends went pale. Then I switched to my actual presentation and delivered 20 minutes of flawless analysis. The professor stopped me after and asked to speak privately. I handed him both drives and said, I'll take my zero on the group portion. It's worth it. Two days later, I got an email. I'd failed the group project as expected, dropped my final grade to a C. But attached was a letter of recommendation to Harvard's graduate program that started with, in my 20 years of teaching, I have never witnessed a student handle betrayal and adversity with such integrity and capability.

The girl I'd raised alone since her mother left when she was three. I stared at the screen until my boss asked if I was okay. I wasn't Emma's fiance. Derek is a professional victim. Everything is someone else's fault. Got fired. His boss had it out for him. Credit destroyed. The system is rigged. When Emma introduced him two years ago, I bit my tongue. But six months ago, Derek convinced her I was controlling because I suggested they shouldn't finance a wedding they couldn't afford. I'd offered to pay for a modest ceremony. Fifteen thousand dollar budget. Derek wanted a sixty thousand dollar destination wedding in Cabo. When I said I couldn't afford that, he told Emma I was sabotaging their happiness. So I compromised. I took out a loan against my contracting company. $45,000. I paid deposits on everything. The resort, the photographer, the band, the flowers, catering for 150 guests. Everything was in my name because their credit couldn't get approved. Emma cried when I told her. She said I was the best dad ever. That was four months ago. Three weeks ago, Derek's mother, Cheryl, started inserting herself into every decision. She hated my input. When I suggested Emma's late grandmother's pearl necklace for Something borrowed. Cheryl said. We don't need funeral jewelry ruining the aesthetic. The cake tasting. I mentioned Emma used to love lemon cake as a kid. Cheryl laughed. That's exactly why she's picking chocolate. She's not a child anymore. She's becoming part of our family now. Our family. Like I was just some placeholder who served my purpose. The final straw came at the rehearsal dinner. Planning. I'd arranged a nice restaurant, my treat. Cheryl announced she'd booked a private yacht instead. A father daughter dinner is so dated. This is about the couple and their real family. I looked at Emma, waiting for her to say something. Just scrolled her phone. Derek smirked. That's when Cheryl said it. Honestly, Tom, you've been generous with the money. Maybe that's enough. You don't need to be at the actual wedding. Your energy.

He came home from work with a bouquet of my favorite flowers, which gave me a little spark of hope. After a nice dinner, he handed me a small flat envelope, not a box. Okay, this was new. I opened it carefully, my heart starting to pound with anticipation. Inside was a single piece of thick, old looking paper. It was the hand drawn map of our town, but it was all wrong. The street names were different and places were marked with weird symbols. One spot was labeled The Day the World Stopped. Another was called the land of Terrible Singing. I stared at it, completely lost. A map, a useless, weird map. My eyes started to well up with tears of disappointment. All my hopes for the night just crashed. I could even pretend to like it. This was the least romantic, most bizarre gift yet. Tom saw the look on my face. He didn't look hurt this time, just smiled gently. Wait, he said. You can't understand it without the other pieces. He disappeared into the garage and came back carrying a large wooden chest. It was beautifully made with our initials carved into the lid. He placed it on the coffee table and unlocked it with the rusty key he'd given me eight years ago. My breath caught in my throat. He opened The lid inside the chest was lined with soft velvet and had little custom made compartments. In each compartment was one of the gifts he'd given me over the past decade. He picked up the smooth gray rock. This is from our first date, he said, placing it on the map. Over the park. We sat by the creek and you were skipping stones. I kept this one from your pile. He then took the pressed daisy. This is from the first time I brought you flowers. You put one in a book to save it. He placed it on our first apartment on the map. The tarpick from the concert where you sang along so loudly and badly. It was the first time I knew I was going to marry you. He put it on the spot labeled The Land of Terrible Singing. The coffee cup charm was for the little cafe where he proposed. Ticket stub was from the movie we saw the night we found out we were expecting our first child. The spot marked the day the world stopped. Each weird, random gift was a physical souvenir of the most important moment from that year. The map wasn't just a map of our town. It was a map of our life together. He hadn't been thoughtless at all. He'd been carefully, silently building the story of us.

She said yes immediately. Then I asked two other people from work. Both said yes. I made a reservation for four people at the Waffle Place and kept the escape room booking. Sunday morning, I woke up to three texts asking what time dinner was. I replied that I was doing brunch instead since the evening didn't work for my schedule. Then I turned off my phone. Brunch was incredible. We ordered way too much food. Amanda got this waffle with strawberries piled so high it was falling off the plate. We laughed about the worst customers we dealt with that week. Nobody mentioned babysitters or nap schedules or anything after that. We did the escape room. We failed to escape, but it was still fun. I posted pictures on Instagram of us covered in syrup and laughing. My phone was still off. I turned it back on before my shift started, 42 notifications. Group chat was a disaster. Kelly said I was being dramatic. Sarah said she couldn't help that her babysitter canceled. Someone else said I should understand they have kids now and things are complicated. My friend Lauren, who I've known the longest, sent a private message. She said I embarrassed them by posting pictures with other people on my birthday after they tried to accommodate me, accommodate me, they changed my birthday plans to fit a babysitter schedule and called it accommodation. I worked my shift, came home, opened The group chat one more time typed out a long message about how I've been asking for daytime hangouts for over a year and kept getting ignored. How every single event gets planned around everyone else's schedules except mine. How it's my birthday and I shouldn't have to celebrate at midnight because that's the only time that works for them. I stared at it for five minutes and I deleted it and just left the group chat. My manager saw the Instagram posts and asked why I looked so happy. I told him I spent my birthday with people who actually showed up when they said they would. He nodded and said, that's what matters.

For 10 years, my husband gave me the same kind of lame birthday gift. And I was starting to think our marriage was falling apart. But on our 10th anniversary, he handed me a strange piece of paper that finally explained everything. My husband Tom, is a good man. He remembers to take out the trash. He makes me coffee every morning and he tells me I'm beautiful even when my hair is a mess. But he is a terrible gift giver. Horrible. Every year for my birthday and on our anniversary, I get my hopes up and every year he'd hand me a small, disappointingly light box. The first year it was a weirdly shaped, smooth gray rock, the kind you'd find on a beach. I smiled and said thank you, hiding the confusion on my face, a rock. For our first anniversary, I put it in my jewelry box. It rattled around, a lonely reminder of his strange choice. The next year it was a single rusty looking key. It didn't open anything in our house. I tried every lock. The year after that, a pressed daisy so fragile I was scared to touch it. Then came a cheap looking silver charm of a coffee cup. Even though I didn't own a charm bracelet, it became a running joke with my friends. What weird thing did Tom get you this year? My friend Sarah would ask. I'd show her The newest oddity, get stubbed from a movie we saw two years ago. A brightly colored guitar pick, even though neither of us played an instrument, a tiny shell. I tried to talk to him about it once. Gently, I asked if maybe we could just go on a trip for my birthday instead of exchanging gifts. He looked so hurt, his face just fell. He said the gifts were important to him, that they meant something. I didn't have the heart to tell him they meant nothing to me but confusion. So I pretended I'd open the small box, look at the strange little object inside and give him my best fake smile. Oh, honey, it's so thoughtful, I'd say. My heart sinking a little more each time. Inside, I was starting to worry. Did he not know me at all? Was this a sign that he wasn't paying attention? Gifts felt so impersonal, so random. It felt like he was grabbing whatever was in his pocket on the way home from work. My insecurity grew with every passing year. We were happy, but this one thing felt like a crack in our foundation. It was a yearly reminder that maybe we weren't as connected as I thought. Last week was our 10th anniversary, a decade. I convinced myself this year would be different. Ten years is a big deal. He had to be planning something special.

If you don't like the way I train you, then quit. So I quit. A year later, he watched me beat his team on national television. The gym smelled like sweat and floor wax. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead. My teammates stood around the wrestling mat silent. Coach Morrison stood over me, red faced, veins bulging in his neck. I was on my knees gasping for air after my third wind sprint in 10 minutes. You're soft, he spat. Always have been. That's why you'll never make varsity. I was a sophomore, 16 years old. I just won my third JV match in a row. Coach, I just need a minute. You need tougher skin. Drop and give me 50. I started the push UPS. My arms were already shaking from the previous drills. At 20, my form broke. My chest hit the mat. Coach Morrison's boot press down on my back. Not hard enough to hurt, hard enough to humiliate. Pathetic, he said. This is why I don't waste time on quitters. My teammates looked away. No one said anything. They never did. I'm not a quitter, I said quietly. Then prove it. Get up and do it again. I got up, started over, made it to 30 before collapsing. Coach Morrison laughed. You know what, if you don't like the way I train you, then quit. Save us both the trouble. I looked up at him, at his smug face, at the way he was enjoying This fine, I said, I quit. His smile faltered. What? I stood up, legs shaking. I quit. I'm done. You're throwing away your season. No, I'm throwing away you. I walked to the locker room, grabbed my bag, left my singlet on the bench behind me. I heard Coach Morrison yelling something about regret, about being weak, never making it anywhere. I didn't look back. That night. I called every wrestling club within 50 miles, found one an hour away. Coach Rodriguez, former Olympic alternate, strict but fair. I showed up the next morning at 5:00am. Why'd you leave your school team, Coach Rodriguez asked. Bad fit, I said. He looked at me, really looked at me. You willing to work? Yes. Then let's see what you've got. I train six days a week, early mornings before school, evenings after homework. Weekends were tournament days. Coach Rodriguez didn't yell, didn't humiliate, just coached. He saw things in my technique that Coach Morrison had never mentioned, adjusted my stance, fixed.

My professor drops the bomb three weeks before finals that the group project is worth 70% of our grade and we get to pick our own teams. My three best friends since freshman year immediately swore me like, obviously we're together, right? And honestly, I'm pumped because we always crush projects together. Professor hands us this massive case study about restructuring a failing tech company and says it needs a 30 page analysis plus a 20 minute presentation. I'm already mentally dividing the work when my friend goes, you're so good at this stuff, you should take the lead. And the other two are nodding like bobbleheads. I figure, okay, I'll coordinate everything, assign sections based on everyone's strengths, set up our Google Drive, you know, actual leader stuff. We make this whole show about being the dream team. And the professor even smiles at us saying, this should be interesting. The assignment packet is thick as a textbook and I'm already highlighting key sections. That night I create a group chat and mention our first meeting tomorrow at the library. Everyone confirms first meeting. Nobody shows up. I sit there for two hours with my color coded notes and structured timeline while they're posting Instagram stories from some party. I text the group, where are you guys? And get back. Sorry, emergency came up. You got this though. Next day in class, they're literally sitting three rows Behind me whispering and laughing. And when I turn around, they wave like nothing happened. Second meeting attempt. One friend shows up 45 minutes late just to tell me she has to leave for her boyfriend's thing, but email me what I need to do. I created this detailed spreadsheet with everyone's parts, deadlines, research sources, and I get crickets. We too. I head over to eat lunch with them. And over here, why is he being such a try hard about this project? It's not that deep. And another goes classic bookworm behaviour. I confront them after class. Like, are you guys going to help on the final or not? And they're suddenly all concerned and serious faces. Of course we're working on it. Stop stressing. But then I see them at the professor's office hours without me. Later, the professor even pulls me aside and says, your teammates mentioned you haven't been responding to their attempts to collaborate. That doesn't sound like you. My stomach drops. I show him my phone, the ignored messages, the empty shared documents, and he just nods but says, try to work it out. Group dynamics are part of the grade. A week before the presentation, I check our shared.

My cheek burned, my ears rang. I could taste copper on my tongue where I'd bitten the inside of my mouth. Karen stood in front of me, chest heaving. Fake. It's red. Finger pointed at my nose. That's what you get for your terrible service. I demand to speak to the manager right now! The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. Somewhere near the back, a shopping cart wheel squeaked. Nobody moved. I was wearing jeans and a plain black T-shirt. No name tag, no uniform. I just stopped by to check inventory before heading home. Cornered me in aisle 7. Started screaming about expired coupons and disrespect and how she'd been shopping here for 15 years and never been treated this poorly. I tried to explain. I didn't work the register. She didn't care. Don't you dare talk back to me! Where's your manager? I want them here now! That's when she hit me. Open palm, right across the face. Hard enough that my head turned. The store went silent. I touched my cheek, felt the heat, felt my pulse throbbing where her hand had landed. She was still talking, still ranting. Something about lawsuits and corporate and how I'd be lucky to have a job tomorrow. I didn't say anything. I just looked at her. She took that as fear, smirked, crossed her arms. Well, are you going to get me the manager, or do I need to call corporate myself? I'll get the manager, I said quietly. She huffed. Finally, some confidence. I walked to the back office. My hands were steady, my mind was clear. I pulled up the security footage, rewind it, watched her slap me again on the screen, save the file, sent it to my phone. Then I walked back out to the floor. Karen was standing there, tapping her foot, phone in hand, already halfway through what looked like an angry social media post. Excuse me? I said. She glared at me. What? Did you find your manager or not? I am the manager, I said. Actually, I'm the owner. Her face went blank. You just assaulted me in my own store, on camera, in front of 12 witnesses. She opened her mouth, closed it, opened it again. I. You. You should have identified yourself. I tried. You hit me instead. You disrespected me. I told you I couldn't help with expired coupons. Her eyes darted around.

My junior year, I transferred schools closer to the club, better academic program, nothing to do with wrestling, I told people. Everything to do with wrestling. I made varsity, immediately started winning big names, state qualifiers. Coach Rodriguez pushed me harder. You've got potential for nationals, said, but you need to want it. I wanted it. Senior year came, I won every match, dominated my weight class, made it to state finals. The championship bracket came out. My final match was against Coach Morrison's team, his star wrestler, a kid he'd been training since freshman year, the same kid who'd watched him put his boot on my back and said nothing. The arena was packed, 15 people, cameras everywhere, local news, ESPN three streaming it live. I saw Coach Morrison in his team's corner. Our eyes met across the mat. He looked away first. The ref blew the whistle. First period, I scored a takedown in 10 seconds. By the end of the period, I was up 8 to 2. Second period, I pinned him, 43 seconds. The crowd erupted. I stood up. Ref raised my hand, state champion. I looked at Coach Morrison. He was staring at the mat, face pale. Coach Rodriguez met me at the edge of The mat shook my hand. You earned this. Thanks, coach. The reporter came over for the interview. Camera rolling live on ESPN three. That was an incredible performance, she said. What's going through your mind right now? I looked directly at the camera, knew Coach Morrison was watching, knew everyone was watching. Just grateful for my coach. Coach Rodriguez believed in me when others didn't, told me that respect and hard work matter more than fear and humiliation. The reporter nodded. Any shout outs? I paused, let the moment stretch. Yeah. To everyone who ever told me to quit, thank you. You made this so much sweeter. Camera cut to a wide shot, caught Coach Morrison in the background standing alone, team around him celebrating. Nothing. He looked up, saw the camera, saw me. I smiled, turned away. The metal ceremony happened an hour later. I stood on the top platform, Coach Rodriguez beside me. Coach Morrison's wrestler got third place, had to stand below me, watch me get the gold.

My ex wife texted me last Tuesday asking if we could talk about something important. I knew it was gonna be bad because she only uses that tone when she wants something unreasonable. We've been divorced for 6 years now and the whole thing was a disaster from start to finish. She cheated on me with some guy from her work and then three months later she's pregnant and swearing up and down it's mine. I told her fine, but I'm getting a DNA test the second that kid is born. Two weeks later, she suddenly had a miscarriage, except I found out from her sister that she actually got an abortion because she knew that baby wasn't mine. Then she had the nerve to tell everyone. I stressed her out so much I made her lose the baby. Divorce got ugly real fast after that. We have two sons together, Tyler is 11 and Jason is 9. We split custody 50, 50, which I fought hard for because she wanted full custody and was asking for a stupid amount of child support plus alimony. She didn't get the alimony and the child support was way less than she wanted because the judge saw right through her lies. He remarried some guy named Glenn about three years ago. He already had two kids from his first marriage, a 13 year Old girl and a 10 year old boy. Then her and Glenn had a baby together last year. So now there's five kids total in that house. Here's the thing. I make good money. I'm an engineer and I've been at the same company for 12 years. I got promoted twice since the divorce and I'm doing well. My house is nothing crazy, but it's nice. Three bedrooms and I turned the basement into a gaming setup for the boys. They've got a PlayStation, an Xbox, a good TV, a mini fridge down there with snacks and drinks. Their friends come over all the time and they basically live in that basement on weekends. My ex wife and Glen are not doing as well. He works in retail management and she does some kind of administrative assistant job. They rent a smaller house and all five kids are crammed in there. The boys share a room with Glen's son when they're over there. They've told me it's so.

Sent Amy a text saying I was back early. Walking up to my apartment door, I heard kids screaming inside, high pitched screaming like little kids do when they're playing. I don't have kids. My brother doesn't have kids that age. Amy doesn't have kids. Someone broke in or I was at the wrong apartment for a second. Open the door and there's a wet kid running around in underwear after a shower, leaving water trails everywhere.

I asked him what the hell he was doing in my apartment. He look confused like I was the weird one. Said Amy told them they could stay here for 2 weeks while I was gone. They wanted to visit the city and go to the beach. Right then Amy texted me saying, oh yeah, BTW, my sister's family is at your place. That's it. No asking, no sorry for not mentioning it sooner, just letting me know after the fact. Completely lost it on him. And Amy's sister who came out of my bedroom told them to pack up and get out right now.

Sister said they had headaches from the drive and didn't think I would mind. That's when I actually did call the cops. Cops showed up as they were loading the last stuff in their car. Told the officer they took my controlled medication. Officer talked to them and got their information. Didn't arrest anyone, but said I could press charges if I wanted. They finally left. Then my phone exploded. Amy's mom calling me selfish, her dad saying I ruined his grandkids vacation. Amy's brother sent me A long message about how I could have just stayed at Amy's place for two weeks so the kids could have a nice time. Even my own mom called, saying I should have been more flexible and that family is important. My aunt said kids need good memories, and I took that away from them. Amy showed up at my door that night crying, saying I made her look terrible in front of her whole family, that her sister spent money on gas to drive here, and now that money was wasted. I asked her why she gave away my apartment without asking me. She said she didn't think it was a big deal since I wasn't going to be there anyway. I told her that wasn't the point. She I had no right to give someone else my keys and let them stay in my private space without even asking me first. She said I was being selfish and controlling, that relationships are about compromise and helping family. I brought up the medication. She went quiet for a minute, then said her sister didn't know they were prescription pills. I asked her how you mistake a prescription bottle with my name on it for regular pain medication. She left and slammed the door.

I'm 26, and I've known this group since college. We used to do everything together. Pizza runs at midnight, random road trips, movie marathons that lasted until sunrise. But then, one by one, they all started having kids. Now it's me and four other people who can't leave their houses without finding someone to watch their toddlers first. At first, I got it. Babies are a lot of work. But then they started planning all these adults only hangouts. Fancy restaurants downtown, wine bars, paint and sip classes. Sounds perfect, right? Wrong. Every single event was scheduled for Friday nights or Saturday evenings because that's when their babysitters could come. I work at a restaurant. Those are literally my busiest shifts. I told them over and over that I could meet up on Tuesday afternoons or Thursday mornings, since my schedule is super flexible during the day. They'd always say, yeah, we'll do that next time. Next time never came. The whole thing came crashing down. Last month, my birthday was on a Sunday, and I asked if we could celebrate during the day because I had to work the dinner shift. Everyone said yes. Perfect. I picked this brunch place that makes these amazing waffles and booked an escape room for after. I was actually excited. Then Saturday afternoon, my phone started blowing up. The group chat was going crazy. Sarah's babysitter canceled, but she found Someone who could come at 6:30 instead. So they wanted to move everything to seven PM on my birthday that they already agreed to do during the day. I texted back that I'd be at work at 7. Radio silence for like 10 minutes. Then Kelly sent a message saying maybe we could do a late dinner after my shift ends around 11. I work in a restaurant. I smell like fire grease and my feet hurt after an eight hour shift. I don't wanna go to some fancy place at midnight on my birthday. I didn't respond. I called my coworker Amanda instead, asked if she

I need some air, she said. Her chair scraping loudly against the floor. As she rushed outside, Patricia leaned forward across the table, her voice low and venomous. Whatever game you're playing, it's over. My daughter deserves to know who she married. I stared at her, panic clawing at my chest. I'm not playing a game, I whispered. I genuinely don't remember any of this. If I've spoken Spanish, if I've worked at a courthouse, I don't know how or why. Something is very, very wrong with me. For the first time, Patricia's expression faltered like she was unsure whether to believe me. She drained the rest of her wine and said, then you either need a lawyer or a psychiatrist because either you're the best liar I've ever met or you're losing your mind. Her words clung to me the rest of the night, long after Diana stopped answering my texts. Next morning, Diana and I sat in our family doctor's office. Doctor Reynolds listened carefully as we explained everything, then ordered neurological tests. Memory gaps this specific are unusual, he said. They can come from traumatic brain injury, early dementia or dissociative disorders. The MRI revealed something shocking, signs of a concussion about 18 months ago, right around when the courthouse employment records began. Reynolds tapped the screen, showing me the darkened regions of my brain scan. This type of injury can disrupt memory formation. It's possible you developed or relearn Spanish during a period you can't recall, the brain is remarkable at preserving procedural skills, even if autobiographical memory is gone. I sat frozen in the chair. The idea that I could live an entire life, gain entire skills and forget them completely made my stomach turn. Diana held my hand but didn't speak. The silence between us felt heavier than the diagnosis. As we drove home, Diana finally whispered, so which is it? Have you been lying to me this whole time? Or do I have a husband who's missing entire pieces of his life? I didn't have an answer. All I knew was that the evidence was real, the recordings, the documents, the photos. And yet none of it existed in my mind. I'd be a liar, a victim or something worse. Maybe my brain had built an entire false timeline to protect me from the truth. Maybe the man Diana married was only a version of me, while another David lived a whole different life in Spanish that I couldn't remember. And maybe, just maybe, I was both men at once.

I waited three hours on the curb until my mom showed up. That was the first time I realised my dad didn't forget me, he just replaced me. After the divorce, I spent weekends with him. At first, he'd try movies, pizza, fake smiles. Then he met Denise and her daughter Sophie. She was sweet at first, calling him Mister Tate. A few months later, she started calling him dad. No one corrected her. Soon my room at his place turned into a storage closet. My clothes ended up in boxes so Sophie could have more space. My birthday cake became a shared Celebration because it's just easier that way. She'd blow out my candles while he laughed and called her his little star. I sat there pretending not to care. When I was 15, he missed my school play because he promised to drive Sophie to her swimming competition. When I got my first part time job, he said, you don't need my help anymore. But when Sophie got hers, he posted about it like he'd raised a CEO. By the time I graduated college, I'd stopped inviting him. He sent a text, proud of you, kiddo. I didn't reply. He didn't notice. For the next eight years, we barely spoke. Then last spring, he called me. Out of nowhere, I Need your help, he said. It's just temporary. Denise had left him, taking their shared house and most of their savings. Sophie had moved to another city and didn't have space for him. The irony nearly made me laugh. The man who once told me, you make your bed, you lie in it, was now sleeping in his car. He begged me to let him stay with me for a while. Against my better judgment, I said yes, but with boundaries, two weeks max. When he arrived, he acted like nothing had ever happened. He complimented my apartment.

My five year old daughter, Ella, decided one morning that she was ready to be a grown up. Not pretend grown up. Real one. Bills, job, house, everything. It all started when I told her she couldn't have cookies for breakfast. She crossed her arms, glared at me, and said, well, when I'm an adult, I'll eat cookies and ice cream for breakfast. I said, sure, honey, when you're older. Big mistake. That night, she packed a pink backpack with three granola bars, two stuffed animals, her toothbrush, and exactly 1:37 in coins she found under the couch. Taped to the front of the backpack was a sticky note that said, Ella's grown up adventure. Next morning I woke up to the sound of the front door creaking open. She was halfway down the driveway dragging her little unicorn suitcase and wearing my old sunglasses that covered half her face. Where are you going? I asked. My new apartment. She said, matter of factly, I already picked it. The treehouse in the park. It has good light. I tried not to laugh. Do you have a job? Yes, she said. I'm a teacher for my dolls. They listen better than real kids. I let her march all the way to the park before following from a distance. She climbed into the treehouse, spread out a blanket, and started setting up furniture. A plastic tea set, Pillow and a shoebox labeled TV. When I called her name, she leaned out the window and shouted, please don't visit unless it's important. Mom, I'm working! She stayed out there for three hours. Every so often I saw her pacing around with a notebook, buttering about taxes and making dinner, which turned out to be a handful of goldfish crackers served on a leaf. By noon she came stomping back home, hair tangled, dirt on her knees, face full of frustration. Being an adult is too hard, she cried. What happened

We placed the tracheal stent to relieve the pressure, but that is a temporary fix. We can't remove the vessel because that supplies blood to both left side arms. But we can't leave it as it is because he can't breathe properly. We need to remove one of his arms. A blood flow test will. We've talked about this. His big arm should go. We talked. We never agreed. I want to remove the little arm. A big arm can't hold a pencil or squeeze a hand. The little arm is not much better. He doesn't want to lose his little brother without his big arm.

Doctor Murphy and I have a condition that sometimes makes it hard for us to understand what other people are. Feeling? Can you tell us why you're feeling sad? My parents. They fight a lot about my arm. What school I should go to, who I should play with. And make them unhappy. When parents fight about their child, it's their fault, not the child's.

When I arrived, a real estate agent and a buyer were already waiting. As they slid the contract toward me, I smiled and said, perfect timing. My lawyer loves surprises. Dad left me the house in his will, just me. My older brother Liam and sis Virra didn't visit him once during his final year. Too busy with their families, they said. Too busy to sit with him during chemo, too busy to answer his calls. I was there every appointment, every bad night, every small victory. Three weeks after the funeral, Liam called. We should sell the house, split it fairly, fairly, like they'd earned it. I said no. Then Vera started texting daily. Dad would have wanted us to share. He loved us all equally. Dad literally wrote a will saying otherwise. He knew exactly who showed up when I blocked them both. I got a calendar invite, family discussion, two PM Saturday. The location was Dad's house. My house. No asking, just assuming. I stared at that invite for an hour. Then I called my attorney, Patricia. Sounds like an ambush. She said, want backup? Come an hour in. I'll text you when perfect. I showed up five minutes late. Liam opened the door wearing a dress shirt and tie. Red flag. He never dressed up for family dinners. Inside, Vera sat at Dad's old dining table with two strangers. A woman in a blazer with a tablet, a man in his 50s holding a leather folder. This is Monica from Berkshire Realty, Vera said cheerfully. And this is Mister Chen. He's prepared to make a very generous offer. Monica slid papers across the table toward me. It can close in 30 days. Your siblings have already agreed to the terms. I didn't touch the contract. You scheduled a buyer before asking if I'd sell. Liam sat down. We're trying to make this easy for everyone. Dad left the house to me, to all of us. Vera corrected sharply. You're just listed as executor. That means you handle the sale and distribute the money. I pulled out my phone under the table, texted Patricia, now that's not what executor means, Vera. Mister Chen cleared his throat. I've driven two hours today. Can we move this along? Liam leaned forward. Look, we know you're emotional. Dad just died. But this is a business decision. The markets good right now. We sell split three ways. Everyone's happy. I'm not selling. You don't get to decide that alone. Snapped. The doorbell rang. Liam frowned. Who's that? I stood up. Perfect timing. My lawyer loves surprises. I opened the door. Patricia walked in, carrying her briefcase in a folder tucked under her arm. Professional, calm, terrifying. Vera's face drained of color. I'm Patricia Caldwell, representing the state executor. She set a document on the table. This, this is the will, certified, notarized, filed with The county crystal clear, the property goes entirely to your brother. Monica stood up slowly. I was told this was a co owned property. You were lied to, Patricia said flatly. Mister Chen grabbed his folder. I don't do business with families who misrepresent assets. He walked out without another word. Monica followed muttering about wasting her.

No answer. No one came. But that night, my sister tagged me in a photo. Celebrating family without the drama. I didn't comment. Four days later, my phone lit up. 73 missed calls and a text from dad. Pick up. This is bigger than you realise. I didn't pick up. I opened my banking app first. I've been paying Brielle's rent for two years, just until the promotion comes through. She'd said the promotion came six months ago. The rent charge never stopped. $1,400 every first of the month. Auto drafted from my account, mom's car insurance, Dad's streaming services, his cloud storage, his triple A membership, Brielle's gym, her meal prep service, her therapy co pays. Even pet insurance for a dog I'd never met. The cardiologist sat on the edge of my bed and asked if anything was weighing on me lately.

David, calm down. We were going to handle we. I turned to her. You knew about all of them. Her silence was the answer. My father cleared his throat. Son, we're working out a payment plan with my credit. I laughed bitterly. How long has this been going on? Mark stood up. The first two investments paid off. I was covering those payments. It's just this last one. You've and doing this for years. Then my father said something that made my blood run cold. We co signed the first one to help him get started. We thought you'd never find out. I stared at him. You helped him steal from me. My mother's face went pale. It wasn't stealing. We're family. We share. I'm calling the police. I pulled out my phone. My father's side. We can cover it. We'll pay the loans. Just drop this. You're willing to bail him out again. And my mother leaned forward. Just let this go. Family forgives. Family doesn't do what he did. Mark rolled his eyes. God, you're so dramatic. I turned to him, voice ice cold. Watch me. Then I walked out. The next morning I sat across from a lawyer. Your brother may have had power of attorney, but taking out personal loans without your direct consent across multiple institutions is fraud. Your parents co signing makes them accomplices do it. I said my mother called six times. When I picked up, she was screaming. The bank froze. The loans, they could involve the police. This could ruin his future. Mom, he ruined his own future. I'm done saving him. I hung up. My father showed up that evening. Son, this is a mistake. Drop this before things escalate. Good. His expression hardened. If you go through with this, you'll lose us, too. I held his gaze. So be it. The bank investigation confirmed fraud. All three loans were voided from my record. Mark was responsible. Now accounts frozen, credit destroyed. My mother called one last time. He's facing charges. He's your brother. I took a slow breath. No, mom. You chose him now. Live with that long silence. Then in a broken voice. So that's it? That's it. Mark took a plea deal. Massive debt, criminal record. My parents stopped calling. For the first time in my life, I was free.

When he opened the door and saw me, he said, absolutely not. I pulled up to Sarah's family home three hours outside the city, gravel crunching under my tires. We've been dating for eight months and she'd been begging me to meet her parents before we left for spring break. My hands were sweaty on the steering wheel. I was nervous but excited. When the door opened, her dad's smile dropped instantly. The color drained from his face like someone had pulled a plug. His eyes went wide, locked on mine. He stumbled backward into the door frame and said, you can't come in here. You can't be here. Sarah grabbed his arm. Dad, what are you doing? This is Jake. What's wrong with you? She looked mortified, her cheeks flushing red. You've never acted like this before. Or. I stepped forward holding up my hands. Sir, I don't understand. Did I do something wrong? Can you please just explain? Sarah's face was turning red. This is so embarrassing. Dad, you're being completely insane. What is going on? Then a car pulled up behind us in the driveway and an elderly woman got out and walked toward the door, a casserole dish in her hands. The moment she saw me, she dropped her keys. The fish slipped from her fingers and shattered on the concrete. She went pale, just like Sarah's dad, one hand flying to her chest, the grandmother's Voice shook. Is this him? She whispered to the dad, ignoring the broken glass at her feet. Photo? Is this the boy? Sarah's head snapped toward them. What photo? What are you talking about? I've never heard you mention any photo. Her dad and grandmother locked eyes. They were having some kind of silent conversation, their faces tight with something that looked like terror. The air felt thick and wrong, like the moment before a storm breaks. Sarah's voice cracked. Tell us what's going on right now or I'm leaving with him and you'll never see me again. I'm serious. The grandmother's hands trembled as she stepped over the broken casserole. There's a photo inside on the mantle. Yeah, the one with my baby pictures in it, Sarah said. What about it? The dad's voice came out barely above a whisper. The photo changed. Your face has been appearing in it for the past week, son. Getting clearer every single day. And then today you showed up here in real life. Sarah looked at me, then back at them. Doesn't make any sense. Jake's never been here before. We've never even driven past this house. I felt ice water pour down my spine. I need to see this photo right now. The grandmother grabbed my arm with surprising strength. Some things are better left unknown. Please, you don't understand what you're asking one. Once you see it, you can't unsee it. I pulled free and pushed past them into the House. Sarah followed right behind me, her breathing quick and panicked. The living room was directly ahead, dimly lit. And there it was on the mantle above the fireplace, an ornate silver frame that looked ancient. I grabbed it with shaking hands. My stomach dropped through the floor. There I was standing in this exact room in this exact spot where I was standing now, wearing a dark blue sweater I'd never owned in my life. The detail was perfect, crystal clear. Every feature of my face, the same scar on my eyebrow, the same crooked.

So I'm 23, and I drive this car that barely passes inspection, but it gets me where I need to go. My friend Tiana is 22 and doesn't have a car, so I started giving her rides to work. Since we live, like, two blocks apart and our shifts start at the same time, we made this deal where she'd throw me 20 bucks every two weeks for gas, and I'd swing by her place on my way. Super simple, right? First month was totally fine. She be waiting outside or come out within, like, 30 seconds of me pulling up. We'd grab coffee sometimes, and the whole thing was actually kind of nice, having company on the drive. Then it started. One day, I texted her, I'm outside, and she took 10 minutes. I was annoyed, but whatever. People have bad mornings. Then it happened again. Then again. Pretty soon, it was every single time. I'd sit there in her driveway watching the clock just tick away while she did god knows what inside. I started showing up late to work. Not by a lot, but enough that my boss, Todd, pulled me aside one day and asked if everything was okay. That's when I knew I had to say something, because Todd's pretty chill, and if he's noticing, then it's bad. So I talked to Tiana about it. I was nice about it, too. I said, hey, I really need you to be ready when I get there because I can't keep being late. She apologized and promised she'd do better. Spoiler alert, she didn't. The very next week, same thing. Sitting in her driveway for 15 minutes while she's supposedly looking for her keys or fixing her hair or whatever excuse she had that day. I texted her again, like, hey, this is still happening. And she said she was really sorry and it wouldn't happen again. Last Friday, I decided this was it. I texted her the night before and said, look, I'm only waiting five minutes tomorrow because I literally cannot risk my job over this. He said, okay, no problem. I'll be ready. Friday morning. I pulled up at 7:15 like always, sent her the text that I'm here. She responds with, one second, I'm watching the time on my dashboard.

So I showed them what family loyalty actually costs. My sister Emma called me three months ago crying happy tears. She was engaged to her boyfriend, Derek. I was genuinely happy for her. I want you to walk me down the aisle, she said. Dad's gone. You're the closest thing I have. I was honored. Our father passed away when I was 23 and Emma was 19. I'd stepped up, helped pay for her last two years of college, been there for every milestone. Two weeks later, mom called. Emma's wedding is going to be expensive. The venue alone is $15,000. Could you help out? How much are we talking? Maybe $25,000. You're doing so well with your accounting firm. It would mean everything to Emma. I thought about it for exactly one day, then I agreed, 25 grand to see my little sister happy. Worth it. I paid the venue deposit, the catering down payment, the photographer's retainer, everything in my name since my credit was better. Last month, Emma invited me to lunch. She seemed nervous. So Derek and I have been talking about the ceremony. Okay? His family is really traditional. They think the ceremony should be intimate, just immediate family and the wedding party. My stomach dropped. Emma, what are you saying? You're still invited to the reception, obviously, but the actual ceremony will be small. Derek's parents His siblings, our mom. That's it. I'm walking you down the aisle. You asked me to. Derek's uncle is going to do it now. His family feels strongly about it. I set down my fork. Let me get this straight. I'm paying $25,000 for your wedding, but I can't attend the actual ceremony? You're making this about money. It's not about money. You're right. It's about respect. And you're showing me I don't have any. She started crying. You're being selfish. This is my day. Can't you just support me? I've been supporting you for 8 years. Apparently that stops at the church doors. I left cash for my meal and walked out. That night, I called every vendor. This is Michael Torres. I need to discuss the Emma Torres wedding contracts. The venue coordinator was confused. Is there a problem? I'm canceling my financial obligation. The client can work with you directly, but remove my name and credit card from everything. Sir, we have deposits. There are cancellation fees. Bill Emmatora.

Three months later, our son arrived. Healthy, perfect. 7 pounds, 9 ounces. We named him Kristoff Magnus. Posted one photo. Welcome to the world, Kristoff Magnus. Named after the greatest man I ever knew. Courtney commented, wow. Seriously? My mom called saying we were being petty. I blocked her number for two months. Nothing. Then last week, my phone rang. Unknown number. I answered. Courtney sobbing, you need to change your son's name. I laughed. Use me. She was hyperventilating. I finally looked it up. I googled what Kristoff means. I waited. It means bearer of Christ. And Magnus means great. His name basically means great Christ bearer. I said nothing. I'm an atheist. Everyone at my work knows I'm an atheist. Do you know what they've been saying? They keep asking me about the religious meaning, if I'm becoming Christian, if I found god. My book club won't shut up about it. They think it's hilarious that I named my son something so biblical. I started laughing. Couldn't help it. She screamed, this isn't funny. You did this on purpose. You knew what it meant, and you tricked me. I said, Courtney, you stole the name. You didn't even bother to Google it. That's on you. You have to change your baby's name. I can't change his birth certificate now. It cost $200, and there's paperwork, and his Social Security card is already printed. I took a deep breath. Courtney, there's nothing I can do about it. Whether you decide to keep it or not is your problem. She started crying harder. Please, I'm begging you. I'll pay you. I'll pay for your name change. $500. Not interested. My husband says you targeted us, that you planned this. I said your husband told me I'd regret keeping the name. Tell him I don't regret a single thing. Then I hung up. She's texted 30 times. Casey called. Threat. Threatening to sue me. For what? I have no idea. My mom finally called, saying maybe we should compromise. I told her she's welcome to meet her grandson when she's ready to apologize. Courtney posted yesterday that she's considering a nickname. Maybe Chris. Every comment is people saying, but Kristoff is such a meaningful name.

The art teacher's email arrived on a Wednesday afternoon with a subject line that made my stomach drop, concerns about Iris. Please call ASAP. My daughter was 7 years old and had been painting with me every single evening since she was 4, creating sunset after sunset with a skill that amazed everyone who saw her work. I called Missus Kellerman immediately from my office, already defensive before she even answered. Mr Cross, thank you for calling back so quickly, said her voice, carefully neutral. I wanted to discuss something I noticed during today's art class. Iris completed a color wheel assignment and I'm concerned she might be having some vision issues. She paused and I heard papers rustling. She labeled every single color incorrectly, not just mixing up similar shades, but completely wrong identifications. She called red gray, orange, brown, yellow, light gray, green, medium gray. Every color on the wheel was mislabeled as some shade of gray. My first reaction was to defend Iris, to say the teacher must have miss understood. But something about the systematic nature of the errors stopped me. I asked Missus Kellerman to email me photos of the assignment. And when they arrived five minutes later, I stared at my computer screen feeling like the floor was dissolving beneath my chair. The color wheel was technically perfect, each section painted with smooth gradients and precise Boundaries, but every label was wrong and exactly the way the teacher had described. I immediately thought about our painting sessions, the three years of evening rituals where we painted hundreds of sunsets together. And suddenly I was seeing them differently. How many times had I said mix orange and pink for those clouds? And watched Iris confidently select paints while I praised her color choices? I left work early and drove home in a daze, calling Iris's pediatrician from the car. Doctor Patell squeezed us in for an appointment the next morning and referred us to a pediatric ophthalmologist named Doctor Vivian Leeds, who specialized in color vision deficiencies. I watched Iris during our painting session with new attention, really looking at what she was doing. We were painting the sunset visible through our dining room window, and I described it out loud the way I always did. Look at those beautiful orange and pink clouds, I said, pointing at the sky. Try mixing some cadmium orange with a touch of titanium white and maybe a hint of quinacrid magenta. Iris nodded seriously and reached for paints, confidently squeezing colors onto her palette. But when I looked closely at what she'd selected my chest, the orange she'd chosen was actually a brown. The pink was a gray. She was mixing them together with complete confidence, creating a muddy, brownish gray mixture. I watched her paint for 20 minutes, describing colors she couldn't see and selecting paints based On some system I didn't understand, and the painting that emerged was compositionally beautiful, but chromatically wrong in ways I'd somehow never noticed before.

I went on a trip away with my male best friend during my husband and his anniversary. Last week was my 10 year anniversary, and I completely forgot. The years been flying by and I was focused on this camping trip I planned with Shane, my childhood best friend. We've been planning it for months because this lake we used to go to as kids was finally reopening. The morning I left, I tried kissing my husband goodbye around 6:00am, but he'd already gone. His coffee mug was in the sink and his work bag was gone. I figured he had an early meeting. Didn't think much of it. Shane picked me up around 8 and we drove four hours north. We talked about old times, laughed about high school. My phone died somewhere on the drive 5, and I didn't have my car charger because I'd left it in my husband's car. We got to the campsite around noon and spent the afternoon hiking. It felt good to disconnect. No work emails, no stress, just nature. When we got back that evening, Shane had a portable charger in his truck. I plugged my phone in and it exploded with notifications. 23 missed calls, texts from my mom, my sister, even my husband's brother Tom. I called my mom back, and she immediately started screaming about how I missed our anniversary to go camping with my ex boyfriend. Shane and I dated for three months in High school, 15 years ago. We've been friends ever since. She said the date. October 12. My anniversary. I felt sick. I had it on my calendar. I'd even bought him a watch. Two months ago, my mom told me my husband had made breakfast reservations at the restaurant where we had our first date. He'd taken the whole day off. He'd gotten his parents to watch our dog so we could stay overnight at a hotel. And I was four hours away with Shane. I tried calling my husband, but every call went straight to voicemail. I sent 15 texts apologizing. Nothing. I told Shane I had first thing in the morning. He got quiet and said we should enjoy the night since we drove all this way. I felt guilty. But it was 9 p m. And driving four hours in the dark on Mountain Road seemed dangerous. We made a fire and sat there in silence. Around midnight, Shane started drinking whiskey. He doesn't usually drink much, but then he got weird. He started talking about high school, how he never got over me, how he should have fought harder when I started dating.

What's the most disturbing thing you've ever seen? I worked at a rage room for three years. Seen all kinds of people. Angry ex wives, screaming teenagers, guys who just got fired. But this one guy, he was different. Walks in Tuesday morning around nine. Regular jeans, a hoodie, beat up sneakers, maybe early 30s. Looked completely normal. Face was just blank, like someone unplugged him from the world. I need your biggest room, he says. How long? I asked. All day, if you let me. I explain we do four hour blocks maximum. Eight hours is our limit. He books two sessions back to back. Doesn't even ask the price. Just slides his credit card across the counter. Then he pulls out a thick stack of 12. He pays the whole thing in cash instead. He says, I wanna make sure this happens. What are you bringing to destroy? I ask. Killing out the waiver? Nothing. He says, I'll use whatever you have. So I take him to our storage area in the back. We've got tons of donated stuff people drop off. Old furniture, broken TVs, boxes of dishes, electronics, random junk from estate sales. Basically whatever people want gone. He starts walking through it, slowly touching things, picking stuff up, setting it back down. Runs his fingers over an old dining chair, opens drawers in a beat up dresser, holds up a coffee mug, reads the bottom and puts it down. He does this For maybe 30 minutes. I'm watching him the whole time, thinking, this guy's either gonna have the best session ever, or he's gonna just stand there. Finally, he stops in front of this bright yellow plastic toy box. One of those ones with cartoon characters all over it. Pulls it out, carries it to the room, doesn't say a word. Closes the door behind him. I go to the security room to watch the camera feed. He sits on the floor, cross legged, opens the toy box, starts pulling out toys one by one. A stuffed brown bear with a missing eye. Three or four toy cars. Those wooden building blocks with letters on them. Plastic action figures. A dump truck with one wheel missing. He lines every single one up in front of him in this perfect straight row, like he's arranging them for a family photo. Then he picks up the bear and just stares at it. I check the time stamp. 10 minutes go by, he's still holding it. 15 minutes, 20 minutes, he hasn't moved at all. Just sitting there looking at this beat up stuff bear. Finally, he stands up, places the bear back in the toy box so carefully, like he's putting a baby down to sleep. Closes the lid gently. Everything else, though, he destroys it all. Picks up a toy car, smashes it with a hammer into dust, grabs the action figures, rips them apart, throws pieces against the wall, takes the Wooden blocks, throws them one by one as hard as he can. The sound is constant. Just bang, crash.

Her husband put his arm around her and glared at me like I was the villain in this situation. My brother showed me text from our extended family, aunts and uncles and cousins since, all congratulating me on my sacrifice. Grandma had apparently donated $5,000 toward the medical costs. They'd told everyone. The entire family believed I'd volunteered for this. Mom grabbed both my hands and said, we even picked out names already. If it's a girl, we're naming her after you. That's when I noticed the overnight bag by the door with my clothes in it they'd packed for me. They expected me to stay here tonight so they could drive me to the appointment in the morning. My sister pulled out her phone and started showing me photos of other surrogates. See how beautiful this is? You're going to love being pregnant. Some women say it's the best time of their lives. Dad moved closer and his voice dropped low. If you don't do this, you're out of the family permanently. No more holidays, no more help with anything. Completely cut off. Everyone was staring at me, waiting for me to just give in and accept this nightmare they'd created. I pulled out my phone and held up the screen showing a recording app that had been running since I walked in. I just recorded all of you admitting to forging my signature on legal documents, conspiring to lie to a medical facility. And attempting to force me into a medical procedure without consent. I watched the color drain from every face in that room. My sister lunged for my phone, but I pulled it back. I found the documents with my name and fake signature in Mom's desk last week. I said I've been recording since I walked in the door. Dad started saying something about this being a misunderstanding, but I cut him off. You're all going to face criminal charges for conspiracy, Percy, to commit medical assault and identity fraud. My sister dropped to the couch looking like she might actually pass out. Mom reached for me, but I stepped back. The consultation I have tomorrow morning isn't at the fertility clinic. It's at the police station where I'm giving my official statement. I grabbed my belongings and headed for the door. As I walked to my car, I pulled the ultrasound photo from my pocket and looked at it. They were so obsessed with creating my sister's perfect family that they didn't even notice I was already starting one of my own.

And then I reported it myself. My mom and dad broke up when I was just a baby. Mom got remarried when I was two and had my half brother, Ryan, when I was 3. Everything seemed normal at first. I split time between my mom's house and my dad's house until I was six. That's when my dad died in a car accident. After that, I had to live with my mom full time. And that's when I started to realise how messed up Ryan actually was. He wasn't just your typical annoying little brother. He was violent. Like, really violent. Even as a little kid, he was choking other kids at daycare, punching teachers, trying to stab people with pencils and Scissors. My mom always made excuses for him. She'd say he was just energetic or going through a phase. But it kept getting worse. When I was 10 years old, Ryan did something that changed everything. We were playing in the living room, and he suddenly grabbed one of his toy cars. Before I could react, he tried to shove it down my throat. I'm not talking about, like, pretend playing. He was actually trying to force this metal car into my mouth while squeezing my neck so hard I couldn't breathe. I remember the feeling of not being able to get air. His fingernails were digging into my Skin. I ended up hitting him as hard as I could to get him off me. We both got hurt, but I had these dark purple marks all around my neck. That's when CPS got involved. They came to the house, took pictures of my neck, and interviewed both of us separately. Ryan had already been in trouble at school multiple times. He hurt other kids so badly that he had some kind of social worker meeting with him once a month. The CPS people said it wasn't safe for me to keep living there. My dad's parents, my grandparents, offered to take me in. My mom freaked out. She didn't want me to leave, but CPS told her it was either me or Ryan who had to go somewhere else. Ryan's dad wanted to keep him, so my mom eventually had to let me move out. The judge and everyone agreed that no kid should be in that house while Ryan was there. Acting like moving in with my grandparents was honestly the best thing that ever happened to me. I got to go to a different school in a better district. I didn't have to hear about Ryan attacking other kids anymore. I didn't have to deal with my mom forcing me to play with him even though he hurt me every single time. My mom was allowed to visit me, but only by herself and only if she asked permission ahead of time. She hated that rule. She thought she should be able to see me whenever she wanted and that I should come to her house. I wanted nothing to do with that place. Over the past seven years, I've only seen her, like, five times total. She never follows the rules about asking permission. She just expects things to work her way. Then last month, I got this text from her. It was a picture of her looking super pregnant, like, really far along. The text said, we need to talk because I'm worried about how we'll manage, and you'll need to help. I just stared at my phone for a minute. She was having another baby with Ryan still in that house, and she wanted me to help her take care of it. I texted back and said, report your pregnancy to CPS instead of trying to make it my problem. She immediately started blowing up my phone, sending me message after message about how this is your half sister and she needs you, and I'm your mom and I need you. She kept telling me to call her. I ignored every single text. Two days later, she sent me this long message saying if I didn't help, my half sister would end up in foster care. She said Ryan's dad's parents were too old to take a baby. Her own parents had died last year, so they couldn't help either. And Ryan couldn't be moved anywhere because of his aggression issues. She made It sound like this was all my responsibility somehow. For two weeks straight, she kept texting, trying to guilt me, trying to manipulate me, acting like I was the bad guy for not wanting to be involved. So I finally did something about it. I called CPS myself and reported the pregnancy. I told them everything about Ryan's history and how there was going to be a Newborn baby in that house with him. Apparently, they went to my mom's house pretty quickly after that because she completely lost it. My phone exploded with angry texts. She was screaming at me through messages, calling me every name she could think of, saying I ruined everything, that I was trying to destroy her family. But here's the thing. She had seven years to get her life together, seven years to deal with Ryan's problems proper.

I discovered my daughter Harley was sneaking a boy into her room every night. When I checked our ring camera footage looking for a package thief, instead of finding someone stealing Amazon boxes, I found Zachary Vaughn climbing through her bedroom window at 1 a. M. Like some wannabe Romeo, this kid was bad news. With his vape pen hanging from his mouth and and sagging below his tiny peppino and gumballs, I knew Zachary from around the neighborhood. He was 19 and still hung around the high school parking lot trying to impress freshman girls with his souped up Honda Civic. Last month I'd seen him get arrested for shoplifting energy drinks from the gas station. He'd also been fired from three different fast food jobs for showing up high. This was definitely not the kind of guy I wanted near my 15 year old daughter. The footage showed this had been going on for two weeks straight. Every night at the same time, Zachary would climb the tree next to Harley's window and slip inside. They'd stay in there with the lights off until about 4 a. M. When he'd sneak back out. My blood was boiling, but I knew if I confronted Harley directly, she'd just get defensive and keep seeing him in secret. I spent the next few days planning my approach while pretending I knew nothing. I watched Harley at dinner acting like the perfect daughter while knowing she was lying to my face, say she was tired from studying when really she'd been up all night with that loser. I had to bite my tongue when she asked for money for school supplies that I knew she was probably spending on whatever Zachary wanted. On Friday, I put my plan into action. I went to the grocery store and bought the most expensive steaks they had along with all the fixings for a romantic dinner. I set up our dining room with candles and Harley's mom's good China that we only used on holidays. I even bought fancy cream sodas in glass bottles and put them in ice buckets like they were champagne. That night, I waited in the kitchen watching the ring camera feed on my phone right on schedule. Zachary appeared at 1 a. M, climbing up the tree in his usual uniform of ripped jeans and a wife beater. I gave them 20 minutes to get come, then headed upstairs with the biggest smile on my face. I could hear giggling and rustling sounds coming from Harley's room. I knocked twice and opened the door without waiting for an answer. Harley shrieked and pulled her blanket up to her chin while Zachary literally fell off the bed trying to pull his shirt back on. They both looked at me like I was about to commit murder, but I just stood there grinning like I'd Won the lottery. Perfect timing. Dinner is ready downstairs. I made steaks, said in my most cheerful voice. Harley's face went from terrified to confused, while Zachary just sat on the floor with his mouth hanging open. Neither of them moved. So I clapped my hands together and added, come on now, don't let it get cold. I've been cooking all evening. They followed me downstairs in complete silence. Harley kept trying to catch my eye, but I just hummed to myself like this was totally normal. Zachary was stumbling over his own feet and pulling at his shirt like he was trying.

Now they wanna meet in person. I'm 22 and have basically zero experience talking to girls. Gaming is where I feel comfortable just bros on discord grinding ranked, talking about KD ratios and complaining about teammates. Last month I misclicked a discord invite my friend sent me. Instead of elite gamers, I joined gamer girls only. No toxic bros allowed. Uh, my first instinct was to leave immediately but before I could exit, they started discussing Advanced Valorant Strats I'd never heard of. I muted my mic and listened completely stunned. When Megan asked why I was quiet, I panicked and said my mic was broken. Then Maya asked about my rank and I accidentally squeaked out Diamond in the highest voice possible. Dead silence for what felt like forever. Then Jessica burst out laughing. Girl, you sound like you've been chain smoking since you were 12. What happened to your voice? They assumed I was a girl with an unusually deep voice. In my panic, I just went with it instead of correcting them. That was three weeks ago. Now I'm Alex they I think it's short for Alexandra and we play together every single night from around eight PM to midnight. Here's where it gets weird. I'm actually good at being a girl online. I listen more instead of immediately offering solutions. I'm way less toxic when we lose rounds and I Ask questions instead of pretending I already know everything. Maya taught me movement techniques and crosshair positioning that boosted my KD from a pathetic 0.8 to 2 2.1. Megan got me into cozy indie games like Stardew Valley that I'd never admit to my guy friends that I actually love. Jessica and I stay up until 3:00am talking about everything. Relationship problems, career stress, family drama, fears about the future. These conversations were deeper than anything I'd ever had with my guy friends. No posturing, no competition, just genuine support. Maya was struggling with her programming bootcamp and I actually helped her debug code for hours. Megan was dealing with workplace harassment and we all brainstorm solutions together. When Jessica's mom was in the hospital, we organized a gaming Marathon to keep her distracted. But yesterday Jessica dropped a bomb. There's a gaming convention next weekend. We should totally meet up. All three of them were instantly excited about meeting up. They started planning matching outfits but King hotel rooms at the same place, making dinner reservations at this Korean BBQ place they've been wanting to try. I spent that entire night researching voice training tutorials on YouTube and wondering if I could somehow pull off showing up in a wig and makeup. I watched videos about feminine body language. I just walking differently in my room and even looked up makeup tutorials for beginners. The complete absurdity of the situation hit me around 2:00am. I was seriously planning to Dress in full drag just to maintain a lie with my three best friends. So I made a decision. The next night during our usual Minecraft session,

I'm the family disaster. At 28, I'm still working retail at GameStop for $11 an hour while my cousins are doctors, lawyers and engineers. Every family gathering, my parents introduced me as Tommy. He's figuring things out like they're hoping I'll disappear mid sentence. Uncle Rick always corners me by the dessert table, still playing games like a little kid. Huh? When are you getting a real job? Then he laughs and slaps my back like we're long time buddies, though he never remembers my birthday. Cousin Ethan finished his residency. Laura's a corporate lawyer making six figures. Mike started some consulting company with a LinkedIn page and an ego to match. They sit around comparing mutual funds and debating mortgage interest rates while I scroll through my phone pretending I'm not about to scream. Mom whispers, Tommy's just a late bloomer. Dad nods like that'll somehow make me blossom. What they don't know. For the last four years, I've been streaming on Twitch as Midnight Gamer 47. It started as a joke. Me playing ridiculous horror games at 2:00am with a busted mic and a webcam taped to a lamp. Just me screaming at pixelated monsters and eating ramen on camera. But people loved it. My over the top reactions, my awkward commentary, the way I jump at every cheap scare. It felt real to them. Viewers trickled in, then flooded. My 12 regulars became 1,000 and, and then 10,000. Then brands started noticing. Gaming chairs, energy drinks, tech Geary got offers I couldn't believe were real. While they thought I was figuring it out, I, I was building an empire. I'd work at GameStop all day, stream all night, sleep for maybe four hours. My community grew into this amazing corner of the internet. Night owls, gamers, people who felt invisible like me. I wasn't just making money, I was making meaning. At first $500 a month, then $5,000, then $20,000. I launched a merch line, partnered with developers, built a second YouTube channel for clips cross platforms, 350,000 followers. But I kept GameStop, kept the charade because being underestimated, it's fuel. Last Thanksgiving, Ethan talked about saving for a house. He showed photos of a four bedroom colonial in Oakwood Heights. It's the dream, he said. But he kept getting outbid by cash buyers. Three weeks ago he called me crying, dude, I can't compete. Every offer I make, someone comes in $25 k over. I don't know what else to do. I, I told him to stay hopeful, but I didn't tell him I'd already made cash offers on two houses in that neighborhood. Last Sunday was our monthly family dinner. Same routine. Ethan moping, everyone else gloating. Aunt Linda handed me job applications just in case I get serious this year. That's when I stood up and gave Ethan.

I've been waiting three months for an appointment with the best cover up artist in the city. He worked out of a tiny shop with just one other artist, and today was finally the day to turn the cursive JM's on my rib cage into a watercolor jellyfish. Two years since Josh cheated on me, and I was finally ready to erase the last trace of him from my body. The artist had been working for about three hours, and he was just starting to shade over the initials. I was lying on my side in the chair with my arm above my head, breathing through the pain, when the bell above the door chimed and the entire room went cold. Oh, my god, that's her. I recognized the voice immediately, even though I couldn't see her. It was the woman Josh had cheated on me with, the one he was still dating. She'd walked in with a friend who was there for a tattoo consultation, but now I heard her heels clicking across the concrete floor toward my station. This is perfect, she said to her friend. Look what she's getting covered up. She could see everything from where she stood, including the unfinished jellyfish over Josh's initials. Josh still laughs about this tattoo, she said loudly. He told everyone she got it after knowing him for Like a week. We dated for eight months before I got that tattoo. But I kept my mouth shut and stared at the floor through the face cradle. She was obsessed with him. She continued getting louder. She used to sit outside his apartment crying. His roommates have videos of it. My face burned, but I stayed silent. The artist's hand tensed against my skin, but he kept working. She pulled out her phone and started showing her friend something. She still makes fake Instagram accounts to comment on my posts. Things like, you don't deserve him and he'll cheat on you, too. It's been two years, and she won't let go. Her friend mumbled something about being sure it was me. Oh, I'm sure. She keyed my car last month. The cops said they can't do anything without proof, but I know it was her. Then I heard fabric rustling and caught movement from the corner of my eye. She pulled up her own shirt to show her friend her ribs. There it was, in the same exact spot. Is mine the same JM in the same cursive script? This is what real commitment looks like, she said, not some desperate tattoo after a week of knowing someone. Her phone camera clicked. Can't wait to show Josh that she's still so pathetic she's getting it removed. The artist set down his tattoo gun. I thought he was going to kick her out, but instead he looked at her exposed Tattoo! And said calmly, I did that one. She sounded pleased. Yeah. Four months ago. He was so romantic about it. The artist looked down at me. Hey, can I add some extra detail to yours? Make it really special, free of charge. Trust me on this. I had no idea where he was going with this, but I nodded. Anything to get through.

Co workers and I grabbed lunch on Sunday, which is the end of our work week. We always do this. It's like our little tradition. One of them, Kelly, had been talking non stop about her diet for weeks. He tried keto, then some juice cleanse thing, then that weird cabbage soup diet. Every lunch she complained about how hard it was to lose weight. This particular Sunday she was really going off about it, saying nobody understood how difficult it was. I'm sitting there eating my sandwich and I said I could lose 10 pounds in 10 seconds. You got this. Being my usual sarcastic self, Kelly snapped back at me, 10 pounds takes a lot of hard work. You all think it's so easy. She was genuinely mad. So without thinking, I reached down, unsnapped my prosthetic leg, lifted it up and slammed it on the table. See, it's that easy. Everyone at the table went dead silent for like three seconds. Then two of them burst out laughing. One guy almost choked on his drink. Kelly's face went bright red, but she wasn't laughing. She stood up, grabbed her purse and left without saying anything. I thought it was hilarious. Best joke I'd made in months. Put my leg back on and finished my lunch. Didn't think anything of it. Monday morning, I'm at my desk doing paperwork when my phone rings. It's HR. They want to see me immediately. I walk down there thinking maybe it's about my benefits or something. Nope. My manager is sitting there with the HR lady, both looking super serious. They tell me they received a complaint about inappropriate behavior during a work lunch. I'm confused at first. Then the HR lady says Kelly reported me for making her uncomfortable and mocking her weight loss journey. She said I humiliated her in front of the team. I tried to explain it was just a joke, that I literally have a fake leg and was making fun of myself, not her. My manager cut me off, said it doesn't matter. I created a hostile work environment, that Kelly felt targeted and harassed. The HR lady pulled out this printed email from Kelly describing the whole thing. Made it sound.

So I threw them out of my house that they thought my son owned. My wife and I bought Kyle a four bedroom house in Pennsylvania right after he graduated college. He wanted to stay in the area, got a good job and we figured it was a smart investment. We live in New Jersey and work in Manhattan, so it gave us a weekend place, too. The arrangement was simple.

We drove down on a Saturday, set up the grill, bought all the food, brought our daughter Sadie, who drove up from Virginia. Ashley's parents and her two sisters came over around noon. Everything seemed great. Her dad and I talked about golf. My wife and Ashley's mom were laughing about something in the kitchen. The sisters were showing Sadie their bridesmaid dress ideas. And about an hour in, my wife and daughter went inside to grab more. Drinks. They came back out five minutes later. My wife's face was completely white. Sadie was fighting back tears. We're leaving, my wife said quietly right now. I tried to ask what happened, but she just shook her head and walked to the car. Sadie followed. I made some excuse to everyone, grab my keys and left. The entire drive back to New Jersey, they wouldn't speak, just stared out the windows. Finally, when we got home, Sadie broke down. They don't want us at the wedding, dad, any of us. My wife nodded, tears streaming down. Ashley's mom said we're not their kind of people, that we'd embarrass them in front of their family and friends. Kyle was standing right there and said nothing. I felt my hands shaking. What Ashley said her family comes from old money and were to working class. Her exact words were they wouldn't know which fork to use. I called Kyle immediately, dad, look, what the hell is going on? He sighed like I was inconveniencing him. Her family has certain standards for the wedding. They don't think you guys would fit in with their Social Circle. It's nothing personal.

Her face went red when I called her out on the family dinner. My brother James and I have always been close. We grew up in a small town, went to the same schools and stayed in touch even after I moved to the city for work. When he met Natalie six months ago through a dating app, he seemed happy, was genuinely excited for him. She was beautiful, accomplished and seemed to make him laugh. He invited me to dinner to meet her properly. That's when everything changed. We sat down at a restaurant. I ordered and we made small talk about her job in marketing and his work as an accountant. Twenty minutes into the meal, Natalie leaned back in her chair and looked at me directly. She said, you know, I don't see the family resemblance at all. You two don't look like brothers. Are you sure you're actually related? She laughed like it was the funniest thing she'd ever said. James tried to smooth it over. He said we had different features from our parents and that I took after our mom while he took after our dad. Natalie waved her hand dismissively and said that it didn't explain it. She said I must have been adopted or that something didn't add up. She kept pressing. I told her that was a weird thing to say to someone. You just Met, she replied that she was just being honest and that I should get a DNA test if I was so defensive about it. The whole dinner became uncomfortable. James didn't defend me. He just kept quiet and finished his food. I left early telling them I had an early morning. I was hurt, but I told myself this was one interaction. Maybe she was just socially awkward. Maybe she had too much wine. I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Over the next few months, I watched my brother pull away from me. His calls became less frequent. When I invited him to my company's annual event, he said Natalie thought it would be weird for him to go without her and they were both busy. When my best friend got engaged and I wanted to celebrate with James, Natalie apparently made a comment that I was always trying to insert myself into his life. James had mentioned this to me casually like it wasn't a massive red flag. I built a successful career at a tech company. I was promoted to senior manager last year, overseeing 15 employees and managing multi million dollar projects. I earned respect in my field. I developed a reputation for being direct, fair and competent. People came to me for advice. I mentor younger employees. This wasn't someone people disrespected without consequence. my own brother's girlfriend had decided I was beneath her attention and my brother was allowing it. Three weeks Ago, there was a family gathering at our parents house. Everyone was there. James brought Natalie. We were all in the living room and my mother was showing everyone photos from a family trip she just taken. She pulled up a picture of me at a company conference speaking on a panel. My mom was proud. She'd been telling everyone about my promotion. Natalie looked at the photo and immediately said, you look so uncomfortable up there. I don't know how you do public speaking. You have such an awkward presence.

It all started three years ago when Jenna was 13. She came to her mom one afternoon after school and told her about this guy from youth group she liked, just normal kids stuff. My wife thought it was adorable. So adorable that she decided to announce it at our BBQ that weekend in front of like 20 people, including the kid. Jenna turned bright red and ran inside. I followed her and she was crying in her room. I went back out and told my wife to knock it off, but she just laughed and said they were just kids and it was harmless. That should have been my wake up call, but I didn't pay enough attention. My wife has always been bad with secrets. He'd tell her sister things I asked her not to share or she'd post stuff on social media I specifically said was private, but I figured she'd at least try when it came to our kid. I was wrong. Over the next couple years, I started noticing more. My wife would be on the phone with her friends and I'd hear her talking about Jenna's period problems or some argument she had with a friend at school, stuff that Jenna clearly told her in confidence. The worst part is my wife would do this when I wasn't home. So I only caught bits and pieces when I came back early or when Jenna Would mention something later that made me realize what happened. By the time Jenna was 15, she he stopped going to her mom for anything, doctor appointments. She'd text me at work, boy drama. She'd wait until I got home and we'd talk in the car, school stuff, all me. My wife started getting upset about it. She'd complain that Jenna never wanted to do mother daughter things anymore and that she was being cold. I tried to hint that maybe she should think about why, but she'd just get defensive. Then last month, Jenna got her first real boyfriend, some kid from her math class. She told me about it because she needed advice on what to do for their first date. I helped her pick out a normal spot, gave her some money, told her to text me if she needed anything. Standard dad stuff. She specifically asked me not to tell her mom yet because she wanted to wait. I respected that. Well, my wife found out anyway. She saw a text on Jenna's phone when it was charging in the kitchen. She didn't say.

So my wife and I won the lotto a few months back. Not like Mega Millions or anything crazy, but enough to completely pay off our mortgage, which was around $300,000. We still had maybe 60,000 left after that. For years we'd been joking about what we'd do if we won. Cut back to part time, spend more time with the kids, maybe take an actual vacation that wasn't just driving three hours to my parents lake house. We'd been buying tickets together for like eight years. When we first moved in together, we were both buying our own tickets every week. Until I pointed out that was kind of dumb since we'd split it anyway. So we agreed on one ticket, joint purchase, joint winnings. That's how it always was. The day we won, I was at work when she called me, freaking out. I literally left my shift early and we went to claim it together. Paid off the mortgage that same week. I'm talking about sitting in the bank with both our names on everything. The check, the mortgage, pay off all of it. And things got weird. She started talking about quitting her job. Like, fully quitting. No part time, no cutting back hours. Just done. I thought she was joking at first because we'd always talked about going part time together. You know, like working, just school, Hours so we could actually see our kids soccer games and school plays and stuff. I asked her straight up if she was serious, and she looked at me like I was stupid, said of course she was serious, that this was her ticket and her money. I literally laughed because I thought it was still a joke. It wasn't. I reminded her we'd been buying tickets together for almost a decade, then we agreed years ago to pool our lotto money. She just shrugged and said the ticket was technically in her name at the store, so legally it was hers, which, like, yeah, the clerk handed it to her, but I was standing right there when we bought it. I told her even without the mortgage, we still needed two incomes. My salary alone would barely cover our bills and groceries and the kids stuff. She said that wasn't her problem anymore, that she'd worked her whole life and deserved a break. I suggested maybe she could take a leave of absence or go part time like we planned, use some of the leftover money for that. She completely lost it. Started screaming about how I was trying to control her and steal her money. Called me a gold digger, like an actual gold digger. We've been married for 12 years. I tried to drop it and bring it up later when she calmed down, but she wouldn't budge. Every conversation ended the same way. Her yelling, me Trying to be reasonable, her calling me names. Then one morning she casually mentioned she was putting in her two weeks notice at work. Just like that. Like she was telling me what she wanted for dinner. I completely snapped. I told her if she wasn't going to share the winnings that were under both our names, then I wanted a divorce, that I'd get half the house value anyway, which meant I'd get half the winnings since that's where the money went. We could either split it now and we both work part time like we planned, or I'd take her to court and get it anyway. She started screaming again, calling me a gold digger, saying I was ruining everything, that I was just like her deadbeat brother who always asked for money. I pointed out her brother had nothing to do with this and that the money was legally ours together. She said I was threatening her. I said no, I was giving

I just stood there like an idiot because grandma had literally texted me 45 minutes ago. What are you talking about? I said. She texted me about wanting Chinese food. The caregiver kept that fake sad face going while holding the door halfway closed. Missus Holloway died four days ago, and I had her cremated like she wanted. I pulled out my phone and showed her the text message I had received from grandma just a few hours ago. Honey, I saw on the news it's going to rain later, so bring an umbrella. Don't forget extra spring rolls. The caregivers face twitched, but she recovered fast. That must be an old message, because look, she pulled out this folded paper from her pocket. Here's the death certificate. I looked at the paper with grandma's name typed on it and some doctor's signature at the bottom. My stomach felt sick, but something was definitely not right here. I need to come inside, I said, and pushed past her into the house. The house felt wrong the second I walked in. Grandma's room was completely empty with no sheets on the bed or clothes in the closet. I donated everything to charity like she wanted, the caregiver said behind me. I saw full bottles of medication sitting on the kitchen counter. Why are These here. I picked one up and read the label. These pills were just filled yesterday at the pharmacy. Caregiver followed me around the kitchen, getting more nervous. They were automatically refilled and delivered because I forgot to call and cancel them. I pulled out my phone and called Grandma's number to prove something was going on. Her jazz ringtone started playing from somewhere below us, and the caregiver practically jumped to block the basement door. That's just my phone, she said quickly. No, it's not, I said. I set up that ringtone for her myself. Her hands were shaking. Now you need to leave so I can finish packing up the house. But I wasn't going anywhere. I shoved her aside and ran down the basement stairs. Stop! You can't go down there! She screamed. Behind me at the bottom was a locked door to what used to be the storage room, and I could hear something moving inside. Grandma! I shouted through the door. A weak voice answered from inside. Help me, please! The caregiver was right behind me now, grabbing at my shirt. She has dementia. She doesn't know what she's saying. I ignored her and kicked the door hard. Stop or I'll call the police! She yelled. Good! Call them, I said, and kicked again. Three kicks and the cheap lock finally broke. The door swung open and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. My 82 year old grandmother was tied to a metal bed. Frame with leather medical straps across her chest and legs. There was an I V. Bag hanging from a coat rack with tubes running into her arm. Papers were scattered everywhere on a folding table next to the bed. Grandma looked at me with foggy eyes like

And then I reported it myself. My mom and dad broke up when I was just a baby. Mom got remarried when I was two and had my half brother, Ryan, when I was 3. Everything seemed normal at first. I split time between my mom's house and my dad's house until I was six. That's when my dad died in a car accident. After that, I had to live with my mom full time. And that's when I started to realise how messed up Ryan actually was. He wasn't just your typical annoying little brother. He was violent. Like, really violent. Even as a little kid, he was choking other kids at daycare, punching teachers, trying to stab people with pencils and Scissors. My mom always made excuses for him. She'd say he was just energetic or going through a phase. But it kept getting worse. When I was 10 years old, Ryan did something that changed everything. We were playing in the living room, and he suddenly grabbed one of his toy cars. Before I could react, he tried to shove it down my throat. I'm not talking about, like, pretend playing. He was actually trying to force this metal car into my mouth while squeezing my neck so hard I couldn't breathe. I remember the feeling of not being able to get air. His fingernails were digging into my Skin. I ended up hitting him as hard as I could to get him off me. We both got hurt, but I had these dark purple marks all around my neck. That's when CPS got involved. They came to the house, took pictures of my neck, and interviewed both of us separately. Ryan had already been in trouble at school multiple times. He hurt other kids so badly that he had some kind of social worker meeting with him once a month. The CPS people said it wasn't safe for me to keep living there. My dad's parents, my grandparents, offered to take me in. My mom freaked out. She didn't want me to leave, but CPS told her it was either me or Ryan who had to go somewhere else. Ryan's dad wanted to keep him, so my mom eventually had to let me move out. The judge and everyone agreed that no kid should be in that house while Ryan was there. Acting like moving in with my grandparents was honestly the best thing that ever happened to me. I got to go to a different school in a better district. I didn't have to hear about Ryan attacking other kids anymore. I didn't have to deal with my mom forcing me to play with him even though he hurt me every single time. My mom was allowed to visit me, but only by herself and only if she asked permission ahead of time. She hated that rule. She thought she should be able to see me whenever she wanted and that I should come to her house. I wanted nothing to do with that place. Over the past seven years, I've only seen her, like, five times total. She never follows the rules about asking permission. She just expects things to work her way. Then last month, I got this text from her. It was a picture of her looking super pregnant, like, really far along. The text said, we need to talk because I'm worried about how we'll manage, and you'll need to help. I just stared at my phone for a minute. She was having another baby with Ryan still in that house, and she wanted me to help her take care of it. I texted back and said, report your pregnancy to CPS instead of trying to make it my problem. She immediately started blowing up my phone, sending me message after message about how this is your half sister and she needs you, and I'm your mom and I need you. She kept telling me to call her. I ignored every single text. Two days later, she sent me this long message saying if I didn't help, my half sister would end up in foster care. She said Ryan's dad's parents were too old to take a baby. Her own parents had died last year, so they couldn't help either. And Ryan couldn't be moved anywhere because of his aggression issues. She made It sound like this was all my responsibility somehow. For two weeks straight, she kept texting, trying to guilt me, trying to manipulate me, acting like I was the bad guy for not wanting to be involved. So I finally did something about it. I called CPS myself and reported the pregnancy. I told them everything about Ryan's history and how there was going to be a Newborn baby in that house with him. Apparently, they went to my mom's house pretty quickly after that because she completely lost it. My phone exploded with angry texts. She was screaming at me through messages, calling me every name she could think of, saying I ruined everything, that I was trying to destroy her family. But here's the thing. She had seven years to get her life together, seven years to deal with Ryan's problems proper.

So I messaged his mistress's boyfriend, and he suggested me and my boyfriend were supposed to go to prom together. I had my dress picked out and my hair appointment set. But a month before prom night, I found an acrylic nail on his bed. Stiletto nail, four inches long. I never wore nails. My heart sank. When foster came home, I confronted him immediately. Whose nail is this? His eyes went wide. I don't, he started, but I cut him off. Don't lie to me. He sighed, like the conversation was an inconvenience. I can explain. My face burned with rage. There is someone, isn't there? I've been asking him for months about his friend Stacy. She was everything I wasn't. Pretty, athletic, rich. It's Stacy, isn't it? He paused, but didn't deny it. Chrissy, it was one mistake. Mistake, huh? Like the two years I'd wasted on him. I flicked the nail onto the floor. We're done, he begged. Please, we can still go to prom. But I was already gathering my things and walking out, tears pooling in my eyes. That night, I locked myself in my room and cried until I couldn't breathe. By morning, I realized Stacy's boyfriend probably didn't know. I found Jaden's Instagram. He was on the basketball team. Taking a deep breath, I messaged him. Hey, Jaden. I know we don't know each other well, but your girlfriend cheated on you with my Boyfriend. His response came quickly. What? Who is this? I swallowed hard. Foster's ex girlfriend, Chrissy. He texted back immediately. Are you serious? When I confirmed, he asked to meet at a cafe after school to learn more. The next day, I waited at Cassidy's. He showed up minutes later. Much easier on the eyes in person. Nerdy, cute, with brown, scruffy hair and glasses. I told him about finding the nail. Confronting Foster, Jaden cursed. How long has this been happening? I shrugged. He said once, but who knows? Jaden laughed bitterly. Casey's been acting weird. Should have known. We looked at each other. Then he looked away. You know what would really piss them off? He asked if we started dating. My eyes shot open. Think about it, he explained. They cheat on us, we pretend to get together. They lose their minds. The crazy part was, I agreed. The next few weeks were actually fun. Jaden and I held hands in the hallways. I wore his basketball hoodie. Every time we passed foster and Stacy, their faces went pale. When foster tried talking to me once, I just laughed and kissed Jaden's cheek. Priceless. At first, it was all show. We practiced our story, coordinated posts, made sure everyone believed it. But somewhere between stolen glances and calculus and late night texts that had nothing to do with revenge, something shifted. I started looking forward to seeing him. Not because it made foster

I did my best not to laugh while she smiled at me across the table like she'd just done me a favour. I took another sip of my chai latte and let her continue. She launched into how I was almost 30 and still living off daddy's money, how it was time I Learned what the real world look like. She leaned back, twirling her new engagement ring. My brother and her had decided that once he took over the company, I should get an actual job instead of partying and shopping all day. I set down my cup slowly. Is that right? Jessica's eyes lit up, probably thinking she'd finally gotten through to the spoiled rich girl. She insisted she was just looking out for the family's future, that someone had to be the responsible one. She patted my hand like I was a child. Maybe you could try retail. I hear they're always hiring. I stood up and smiled. Thanks for lunch, Jessica. This was enlightening. 30 minutes later, I was walking through the executive floor of the Million Dollar investment firm my father built from nothing. Good afternoon, miss, the receptionist said as I passed. My office was three doors down from Dad's corner suite. I'd started in the mailroom at 6, worked in every department, making my way up, all while going to college and To show for it, I spent the last five years managing our highest profile accounts. My dad wanted me to earn respect on my own merit, not my last name. When I entered his office, he was grinning, talking about the announcement for Friday's gala. The board was thrilled. I asked if he was sure about the timing. He nodded firmly, explaining his plans for my brother. My brother would run the charitable foundation. My dad said he needs to learn humility and what better way than to serve the community. I thought about Jessica's smug face at lunch. Dad, that sounds like a perfect plan. But until Friday, I still had some cleaning up to do. Tuesday afternoon, dad called. Your brother just charged $3,500 to the company card at a strip club. He told the client it was a business lunch. Jessica had texted me that morning, can't wait to see you Friday. My future husband's going to make such an amazing C E. O. I looked at her text, then at Dad's crisis. Yeah, amazing. This was my role, the family fixer. My brother's third wrecked Mercedes. I handled it. His insult to a board member's wife, I smoothed it over. His no show to our biggest pitch. I closed the deal with only 30 minutes notice. And I am damn good at it, too. I'll take care of it, I told dad, pulling up the client's information and address for the strip club by five PM. I'd moved the meeting to our private dining room, comped the entire meal and convinced the client that.

My wife put both of our kids in the van and left for the day. She was screaming at me because I forgot to do the dishes until she just took the kids and left for the day. I was so pissed off I just fell asleep but quickly woke up to someone knocking at the door. Not a normal knock either. Someone was literally pounding on the door to get me to answer. Through the peephole, I saw two police officers standing there. I answered the door and asked if I could help them. As soon as I saw their faces, I knew something had happened. They had that look. And when I saw them take their hats off, I was confused. I opened the door waiting for them to say something, but neither of them looked like they wanted to. Sir, we need to ask you a few questions. Your wife home? What? Why would he ask that? I said, uh, no, why? What's going on? They both looked at each other. Sir, does your wife happen to drive a blue minivan? Yeah, she just left with our kids 40 minutes ago. Why are you asking about her car? The words came out faster than I meant them to. We been screaming at each other, but she was still my wife. She was my home. One of them took a small step forward. Sir, we have some difficult news. You Might want to sit down for this. Oh, no. I started getting mad. No. Tell me what's happening. Is she hurt? He put his hand on my shoulder. Sir, there's been an accident on the freeway. What the hell? My legs suddenly felt like they couldn't hold my weight. The stupid good fight didn't matter anymore. I wasn't even thinking about that. An accident. Are they okay? Are they at the hospital? He looked like he was struggling. Sir, I'm afraid the accident was severe. There was a collision with a semi truck and there was an explosion. The world started tilting. I gripped the door frame to keep from falling. The last words I'd said to her were, fine, whatever, get out of here. I hadn't even said goodbye to the kids. But they're okay, right? My wife and kids have to be okay. I can call her right now. I pulled out my phone with shaking hands, nearly dropping it twice. Her number was at the top of my recent calls. It rang once, twice, then straight to voicemail. I hung up and called again, straight to voicemail. This time, sir, there were three fatalities in the vehicle, 3. My wife, who I just let storm out angry, both my kids and my beautiful wife. My everything was gone just like that. Literally fell to the floor before the officers could catch me, trying to keep my face in my hands. I didn't even say I love you. I didn't hug them goodbye. The last thing I said was, fine, whatever. She left mad at me. They all left with her mad at me. I was babbling. Now tears streaming down my face. Sir, we understand this is incredibly difficult, but we really need you to come with us. There are procedures that need to be followed and time is important for the identification. I reached.

I first noticed them in the cereal aisle. A well dressed woman carrying a crying little girl, maybe 3 years old. The child's face was red, tears streaming. But something about her cries seemed desperate, different. Not like a tantrum. I'm a kindergarten teacher. After 15 years, you develop a sense for these things. The woman kept whispering, it's okay, sweetie. Almost there. But she wasn't doing any of the natural things a parent does. No rubbing the back, no gentle bouncing, no terms of endearment. That felt personal. I followed at a distance, pretending to shop. The girl's cries started changing, becoming more panicked. I want my mommy, she whimpered. You said Mommy was here. The woman shifted uncomfortably. We are, honey. Just a few more things. Her eyes darted to the exits. When they reached the dairy section, I saw another woman with a cart full of groceries. She was younger, probably early 30s, talking frantically on her phone. I don't know, John. She was right here. I just turned around for a second to grab her juice. He knows not to wander off. No. She was wearing her favourite butterfly clip. The purple and silver one? Yes. And her yellow polka dot dress. My stomach dropped. The crying girl was wearing exactly that. A yellow polka dot dress and a butterfly hair clip. Purple and silver, just like the one the younger woman was now. Clutching in her free hand, I stepped closer to them, acting like I was reaching for milk. The girl's next words confirmed everything Mommy had

Bree would tell me sure their father lives in the house. But what made it so weird or awkward, I couldn't even figure out how he knew my cycles. Someone, one of my friends must have told the school counselor because next thing I knew the intercom stated, can Lizbeth come to the office? Can Lizbeth come to the office? Thank you. I stared wide eyed. I didn't do anything wrong, so why was I being called to the office? I stand up and make my way to the office. I look at the receptionist and say I I was called to the office. Lizzie back, the reception asks me as I nod and she waves her hand to the school counselor's office. Why, I asked? Slowly and confused, the receptionist just shrugs. It's open, a female's voice yells out. I enter the office and close the door behind me. You can call me Jay. Is it okay if I call you Lizzie? I not. Why am I here? Jay's mouth puckers like she just tasted something extremely sad. A few of your friends are worried about you, Jay says gently. I tilt my head, but why? Before I answer the why question, can you answer one question for me, Jay asks. I nod. Can you describe your father's car? Jay asked me. Um, a black Toyota four door car, I answered slowly. Jay pinches the bridge of her Nose before nodding, she slides a picture of my father's car. Is this your father's car? I look at the license plate before nodding, it is. Before shaking my head. Why am I here? Why do you have a photo of my father's vehicle? What's going on? Do you know the definition of the word stalking, Lizzie? Jay asks me instead. It's when someone watches your movements, restricts your movements in person or through technology, I say slowly. Do you think it's normal for your father to know and track your cycles when he only has visitation rights? Jay asks. I freeze before my face starts paling. No, I answer with more of a question. it is not, Jay explains. It is restricting your life is not. I blink hard at her word choice. You think my father is stalking me? We don't think we know he is stalking you. This photo is from months ago because the vehicle always rolled up to school when school would start. It wouldn't leave till it saw you. We have photos of him from the moment you started at this school, started investigating before you arrived here. And he's been doing this for years, always outside in his car waiting the whole day and is seen following you multiple times. That is why you have changed schools so many times at the discretion of your mom. It's not normal to have fathers track their daughters cycles, is it, when they only Have visitation rights? I ask shakily. Jay just stares sadly at me. No, it isn't. It's predatory in nature and a threat to your safety, Jay finally explains it to me. I into the trash can as tears steam down my face. Why would he do that? I saw. Jay stands up and rubs my back as she pulls my hair away. I'm sorry, child, he was grooming you, she answered me. Truthfully. I saw because that made it worse. We already contacted the authorities on this matter, Jay responds. Why? Because you are a wonderful young lady and I have a safe spare bedroom, that is if you want it. The nervous energy from Jay eased something. Did my mom agree? I asked. She did. She is in the process right now of getting an emergency restraining order against your father, along with terminating his right to see you. That's why I offered you a safe place for a while, Jay explains. Thank you. I nod, accepting the help. She hugs me tightly. I will protect you and you will never have to worry about your father again. It will be over my dead body if he ever tries to see you ever again.

My roommate Kate has this incredible superpower of she can selectively forget her wallet every single time we go somewhere that cost money. But somehow she never forgets it when she's going shopping alone or getting her nails done. We've been living together for eight months and I've been keeping track. She's forgotten her wallet 17 times. 17. And every single time she gives me this look like I'm supposed to cover her because I have a corporate job and she's a freelance artist. Last Tuesday, she comes bouncing into our apartment with this huge grin. Guess what? I booked us a table at Meridian for my birthday dinner Friday night. I invited Jessica, Mike and L too. Meridian, the place where appetizers start at $35, knew exactly what was coming. This was going to be her biggest scam yet. Order expensive food for everyone on her special day, then conveniently forget her wallet and guilt everyone else into splitting the massive Bill. Friday night arrives, she's getting ready, humming some Taylor Swift song, completely in her element. I'm watching from my doorway as she does her usual routine. Phone, check. Keys, check. Lipstick, check. Tiny purse, check. She even did that fake little gasp and snap, like got everything, as if to seal the performance. But there it was, her wallet sitting in plain sight on the nightstand, once again, mysteriously excluded from the essentials. It was like watching Someone rehearse a scam she's pulled off a dozen times. Wallet sitting on nightstand, ignored. I'm just going to touch up my mascara real quick. She calls out, heading to the bathroom. That's when I made my move. I slipped into her room and grabbed the wallet. Black leather, kind of heavy actually. I could feel credit cards and cash inside. We meet everyone at the restaurant. Meridian has this whole upscale vibe, dim lighting, fancy cloth napkins, waiters and actual uniforms. Kate is in full birthday girl mode, telling everyone to order whatever they want. It's my special day. Go crazy. Jessica orders a 40 dollar salmon. Mike gets the 55 dollar steak. L goes for the lamb, which is like 60 dollars. Kate orders the Seafood Tower for herself. Eighty five dollars. We're laughing, having a good time, taking birthday photos. Kate is being the perfect hostess. Then the check comes, $230. Kate looks at it and starts patting down her tiny purse, checking her jacket pockets, looking under the table. Oh my god, you guys, I am so embarrassed. I totally forgot my wallet at home. Here we go. Can someone cover me? I'll Venmo every.

I freeze in the hallway of my parents house, the house I've been secretly paying the mortgage on, listening to her continue. Three years of this drama. I hear my mom say, every week there's a new symptom, a new doctor, more excuses to miss family events. My other daughter would never milk an illness like this. I peek around the corner and see about a dozen guests at the party I wasn't invited to. Found out yesterday when my cousin texted asking why I wasn't on the Facebook event. Your parents said you were too sick to come. She'd written, confused. I have a nerve condition that causes constant pain and paralysis episodes. It's been documented by four specialists. Visible on MRIs and require weekly infusions that cost me $400 out of pocket. But here's what makes my blood boil. I'm standing here with bank papers in my jacket showing I just paid the final $18,000 of their mortgage. Been paying it off for five years, eating dollar store food, skipping my own medications to afford their house payments. Today was supposed to be my big reveal. The wrapped mortgage deed is literally in my pocket right now. After hearing my mom's real thoughts about me, though, I'm oddly grateful for the timing. I step into the living room where my mother is now performing for The group. The worst part is when she posts about it online, she says, shaking her head like we need the whole world knowing our daughter is defective. My sister laughs and adds at least you have one functional child, mom. Imagine if both of us were burdens. My father raises his beer. Thank god for small miracles, right? The room toasts to my sister while I stand in the doorway, invisible. Honestly. My mother continues getting louder. I think she likes being sick. Gives her an excuse for why her life isn't together. Meanwhile, we're the ones who suffer, watching her deteriorate by choice. My sister piles on. Remember when she claimed she couldn't walk for three days, but somehow made it to the bathroom just fine? They don't know I crawled to that bathroom crying from pain, pissing myself twice when I couldn't make it. My mother nods enthusiastically. The neurologist probably diagnosed her with something just to shut her up. Doctors these days will say anything for repeat customers. My aunt agrees. You should cut her off financially. Teach her to stand on her own feet. My mother's response destroys me. Oh, we did that. Two years to go. Haven't given her a penny since she started this whole sick act. If she's really as bad as she claims, maybe she'll finally just. She trails off at everyone knows what she means. The mortgage payment receipt burns in my pocket. I walk fully into the room.

My sweet people pleasing best friend just destroyed her boyfriend's entire identity with one perfectly calculated revenge move. And honestly, he had it coming. You know those girls who apologize when someone on their foot? That's her. Or at least it was before the tattoo incident that turned her into someone I barely recognise. Picture this. It's her 18th birthday party and I'm watching this train wreck unfold in real time. She's the type who gives everyone her last dollar, brings soup when you're sick, remembers your dog's birthday. Her boyfriend, six months of dating and he's already trained her to apologise for existing. I bring out this gorgeous rainbow cake I spent three hours making because it's her favourite. This man child looks at it and goes, what is this clown vomit. Everyone knows I only eat chocolate. He even blows out her candles. She actually apologizes to me later. My blood is boiling. Later when most people have left and were just chilling, she finally mentions what she actually wants for her birthday. I've been thinking about getting a small butterfly tattoo, she says quietly, almost like she's asking permission. My grandmother had this butterfly sanctuary before she passed and I just want something to remember. Her boyfriend cuts her off with this disgusting laugh. Butterflies? What are you, a stripper? That's so trashy, babe. The room goes silent. She excuses herself with tears. In her eyes. And something in me just snaps, dude, what is wrong with you? Go apologize now. He rolls his eyes but follows her. She comes back 15 minutes later with this forced smile, saying he's offered to pay for her tattoo as an apology. A week later, she calls me and her voice sounds off. So he decided he's going to do the tattoo himself since he's been training, she says. My stomach drops. Wait, what? No, absolutely not. If you want something affordable, my boyfriend has been doing this for four years. He'll give you a friend discount. But she's already making excuses for him. He says it'll be good practice and will save money. Three days pass, radio silence. Then she shows up at my door. And I've never seen her like this. Not sad, not crying, but furious in a way that makes the air feel electric. Look what he did to me, she says, turning around and lifting her shirt. This psychopath tattooed his name across her back in huge letters. He convinced me to let him do it on my back because he said it would frame my shoulders beautifully, she spits out. Kept telling me not to look until it was done, that it was going to be a surprise upgrade to the butterfly. But wait, here's the plot twist. She's not here just to cry about it. I need a favor, she says. He already has an appointment with your boyfriend. Tomorrow for his big tough guy skull and flames chest piece he's been planning. I smile. Oh, I can work with this. An hour later, I see her boyfriend posted a picture of the tattoo, bragging about marking his property and how she'll never be able to leave now. The next day, the walk.

Can we talk? You just walked out. That was immature. It was a joke. Around noon, she showed up at my door. You embarrassed me. I raised an eyebrow. You're embarrassed? That's interesting. She placed a paper bag on the table. Inside was the silver necklace I'd given her. You should take this back. Keep it, I said. It fits who you were last night better than it ever fit us. You're really going to end things over one stupid, stupid comment? It wasn't one comment, Mia. It was a mirror. You finally said out loud what you've been thinking for months. She looked down, silent then. I didn't mean it like that. You meant it exactly like that. You just didn't expect me to hear it. So what now? You just walk away? Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing. You'll regret this. People don't leave me like this. I smiled. Then I guess I'll be the first. That night, I got a message from someone at the dinner. She's been talking behind your back for weeks. Said she was only with you because you're safe. A few days later, another message. Mia's been seeing her old boss. It's been going on for months. We all knew. But she told everyone you two were open. The late nights, the sudden work trips, the way she flinched when her phone buzzed. It all made sense. Then came an anonymous message. HR's investigating your girlfriend and her boss. Someone sent Screenshots of their messages. I just sat there sipping my coffee. Revenge wasn't necessary. People who betray you always find their own punishment. Within a week, her social media was gone. Mutual friends stopped mentioning her. A few weeks later, I got one final message from her. I lost my job. HR. Said it was for professionalism. I just wish you'd talk to me before you walked away. I typed one reply. You talked plenty. I just started listening.

So my daughter Riley is 15, and she's been at the soccer camp twice a week all summer. About a month in, she makes two new friends. First time they come over to our house, I knew it was gonna be a problem. They walk in, don't even say hi, just go straight to Riley's room, blasting music from a phone speaker. I'm talking like you could hear it from the driveway. I go upstairs and ask them to turn it down because I'm on a work call. One of them, this girl with bright pink nails, literally rolls her eyes at me and goes, we're not even being that loud. The other one just laughs. Riley doesn't say anything, just stands there looking at her phone. I turn the music down myself and leave. 20 minutes later, I come back upstairs, and the hallway bathroom looks like a tornado hit it. Makeup everywhere, towels on the floor, water all over the counter. I asked them to clean it up, and pink nails girl goes, we were gonna do it in this tone, like I'm bothering her. They do this half job clean up where they basically just shove stuff around. Then when they finally leave, I go to grab money off the kitchen counter that I left there to pay the lawn guy. 40 bucks gone. I tore that kitchen apart. Looking for it. Checked my purse, checked the drawers, checked everywhere. It was there before they showed up and gone after they left. I didn't have proof, but come on. I told Riley those girls aren't allowed back at our house. She got mad and said I was being unfair and that I didn't even know them. I said I knew enough she could still see them at soccer camp. But that was it. Fast forward two weeks. I'm at work, and I get a call from Coach Stevens. He says there was an incident at the Arby's next to the field, and I need to come pick up Riley. I leave work early, drive over there, and Coach Steven shows me a video on her phone that she got from the Arby's manager. It's Riley's two friends inside the Arby's acting like complete idiots, yelling at the worker behind the counter, some kid who looks maybe 17. One of them reaches over and grabs a handful of napkins and throws them in the air. The other one takes her drink and just dumps it on the floor. Not like an accident. Like she turns the cup upside down and pours it out while staring at the worker. Then they both flip him off and walk out laughing. And Riley is right there recording the whole thing on her phone, laughing. You can hear her laughing in the video. Coach Steven says the manager called the camp and threatened to Ban all the kids from coming to the plaza, she says. If it happens again, those three are out of camp. I don't even wait. I tell

What beach house papers, I asked. My aunt's smile disappeared and she slowly turned to stay stare at my dad. His face went completely white. I said, dad never told me about any beach house. The entire backyard went silent with 20 people staring at us. Something was definitely wrong here. My aunt set down her drink carefully. The beach house in Santa Barbara that your mom left to me when she died five years ago, she said, I couldn't breathe properly. Mom left a beach house. My aunt pulled out her phone. She made me promise to give it to you when you turned 30, which is today. She showed me pictures of a three bedroom house with an Ocean View worth at least $800,000. I've been renting it out for 4,000 a month and saving everything for you, she explained. My aunt scrolled to her bank statements. I told your dad six months ago I was ready to transfer it. He knew for six months while I was working myself to death. you knew about it and we'd all meet at the lawyer's office next week. She continued. Dad still wouldn't look at me and kept pretending to scroll through his phone. My aunt frowned. Three months ago your dad called and said you needed help with bills so I should switch the rent. Deposits to his account temporarily. She showed me the bank transfers showing $12,000 total. He said he was helping you save for a down payment. She, my stomach turned when I realized what this meant. Last week he texted me this. She showed me Dad's message saying I wanted to keep renting it out and to keep sending him the money. He was planning to steal $48,000 a year from me forever while I couldn't even afford to fix my broken phone screen. I've been living with her eight months. I stood up so fast my chair fell backward. You've been stealing 48,000 a year that was meant for me. Everyone at the party was watching. Dad finally looked up. You're being dramatic about this, I said. I said, dramatic? I work 60 hours a week at two different jobs. I live in a studio apartment with black mold and I can't even afford a car. My aunt pulled out more papers. There's no mortgage because I paid it off, so it's all profit, she said. Mom tried to speak up. We needed help with our bills, she said quietly. I turned on her. What bills? Your new truck, the kitchen remodel, the cruise to Mexico. I turned back to my aunt. I've been eating rice and beans for months. I sold my laptop to pay rent. I walked two hours to work because I can't afford the bus pass. I told her, dad stood up. You wouldn't be able. To handle property.

She lost it. Started yelling about how I'm judging people and I don't even know them. I said, I know exactly what I need to know. They stole from my house, trashed my bathroom, disrespected me in my own home, and now they're making videos of themselves harassing workers for fun. And you were right there laughing along.

Oh, he's comfortable where he is. He likes his little projects. It's cute. The word cute hung there, a polite Insult wrapped in charm. Her friends laughed. She saw exactly how deep it cut. When the check came, she leaned over and whispered, don't be mad. I was just joking. I smiled. I know. I'm just done laughing. She didn't get it until I stood up and said, then you'll love life without me. The next morning I woke up to a dozen.

Three days later she saw the receipt for my beater car and called me in tears. I'm a software engineer at a tech startup. I make decent money, but I've never been the flashy type. I drive a 2007 Camry with a dent in the passenger door and a bumper sticker that says my other car is also a Camry. I wear the same rotation of jeans and hoodies. My apartment is a small one bedroom downtown with IKEA furniture and a TV I bought on Black Friday three years ago. Nothing about my life screams wealth. My girlfriend Sarah met me at a coffee shop two years ago. She was sitting at the table next to mine, complaining loudly on the phone about how the barista got her order wrong. When she hung up, I made a joke about how coffee shops are basically Chaos Labs. She laughed. We talked for an hour. She worked in marketing for a midsized firm and was always about appearances. Designer bags that she'd save up for months to buy, trendy restaurants she'd insist we go to for Instagram photos. Her entire life was curated for social media. But she was fun, smart. I thought she liked me for me. When I proposed last month, I chose a simple ring. Clean solitaire, white gold band, $800. Nothing flashy, but it was elegant. It meant something. She opened the box at The restaurant smiled wide, hugged me, said yes. I thought we were solid. Two days later, she sat me down on my IKEA couch. Babe. I showed my friends the ring. They asked how much you spent. When I told them, they literally laughed. Rachel said her fiance spent five grand on hers. This is embarrassing. I need you to return it and get something real. I blinked. Something real. She pulled up her phone and started scrolling through pictures. 3 karat diamonds, Halo settings, 5, 6, seven thousand dollar rings. Something like this. Something people will actually notice. I told her I couldn't afford that right now. She went quiet. Then she said, maybe we should wait until you can. I don't wanna walk around with this on my finger and have people think you don't value me. That hit different. I didn't argue. I just took the ring back, told her I'd handle it. She kissed my cheek, grabbed her purse, and went to brunch with Rachel and the rest of her friend group. The same friends who laughed at my proposal. The next day, I got a flat tire on the Camry. I've been putting off replacing it, but this felt like a sign. I called the Porsche dealership where I've been casually browsing for six months, told them to go ahead with the purchase. They delivered it that afternoon while Sarah was at work. A 2024 Porsche 9 1 1 Carrera midnight blue. Paid in full. $140,000. Parked it right in my assigned spot in the apartment complex lot. Sarah came home, saw it through the window, and texted me immediately. Whose car is that in your spot? I replied, mine. Bought it today. She called instantly. What do you mean, yours? How. Where did you get the money? I told her I've been saving stock options from work. Vested last year bonuses I never touched.

I called an arborist. Guy came out and took soil samples, said there were unusual chemical levels in the ground. Could be contamination. He recommended I document everything and maybe install a camera. Cost me $180 for the visit, but I took his advice, installed a cheap security camera aimed at the tree. Three didn't tell anyone. That night at 2:00am, I got a motion alert on my phone. I watched Glenn Martin hop our fence with a gallon jug. He poured something around the exposed roots for maybe 90 seconds, then climbed back over. I was shaking, I was so angry. Save the footage to three different places. The next morning, I knocked on their door at 7:00am. Glenn answered in his bathrobe, looking annoyed. I held up my phone and played the video. His face went white. He started stammering about how it was just water for the roots because they look dry. I said the time stamp shows 2:00am. Who waters trees at 2:00am? He said I was harassing him and slammed the door. I posted in the neighborhood Facebook group. Didn't name them directly, but said someone was poisoning my tree and I had video evidence. The cop comments exploded. Turns out the Martins had filed noise complaints against the winters for their dog. Reported the ngunians for parking on the street during their daughter's graduation party. Called Code enforcement on the Castillos for having a trampoline. Half the neighborhood started commenting they'd had problems with them. The other half said I was being dramatic over some leaves. People were fighting in the comments. Someone suggested a neighborhood meeting. Someone else said that was a terrible idea. My wife started getting nervous. Said, maybe we should just trim the tree way back, keep the piece. I said, no, this was about principal now. Then three days ago, their son Jonah showed up at my door. He's 10 years old, eyes all red, like he'd been crying. Asked if our treehouse was still there. I said, yes. He said he missed playing with June. Then he just broke down sobbing. I didn't know what to do. I called for my wife. Jonah said his parents made him lie to a city inspector. Last week. They called about the tree being a safety hazard. Told Jonah to say the branches hit their bedroom window during storms and kept them awake. But Jonah said that wasn't true. The tree didn't even reach their window. He said the real reason was they wanted to put in an inground pool, their dream pool. But the contractor told them my tree's roots spread into the perfect spot. They could build it three feet over, but then it wouldn't get afternoon sun. His mom had picked out pool furniture and everything. I asked Jonah if he was sure. He nodded and showed me pictures on his mom's phone that He'd snuck pool designs, measurements, an email from the contractor saying the tree roots were the only issue. And removal would cost the neighbors $4,000 to six thousand dollars. I heard a car door slam. Glenn was walking up my driveway. Saw Jonah on my porch. Started screaming at me for talking to his kid without permission. Threatened to call the police. Said he'd sue me for harassment and corrupting a minor. Jonah ran home crying. Now the Facebook group is completely out of control. People are choosing sides. The nguins organized a petition supporting us. The Bennett started one supporting the Martins. Someone called it Tree Gate. My ring camera caught Jolene taking pictures of our house yesterday.

Okay, quick recap. Remember how my crush said she'd come to the talent show? She actually did. I swear, I've never been that nervous in my life. My hands were shaking, my throat was dry, the lights were blinding. But then I saw her. She was in the crowd, phone in hand, smiling at me. And suddenly everything clicked. I forgot about the audience and judges. It was just me and her. I sang like I was singing only to her. After the show, so I was backstage trying to process that I didn't mess up. Then she walks in, bone still in hand, cheeks pink, and says, I think I have a new favorite singer. I tried to play it cool and said, well, I owe you for cheering me on. She grinned. I'll remember that. I didn't think much of it, but later that night, while rewatching videos from the show, I get a text. So how about you pay me back with a walk? I just stared at my screen, heart racing, typed and deleted my reply three times before finally sending yeah, sure. When? 10 minutes later, we were outside. Nothing fancy, just walking quiet streets, talking about random stuff. Favorite songs, childhood stories, how we both secretly love ASM. Every few minutes we bump shoulders and laugh like idiots. Eventually I walked her home. At her door, she smiled and said, today was really fun. Then she Hugged me. Not a quick hug. One of the slow, soft ones, so you can feel every heartbeat. Neither of us wanted to let go. When we finally did, she looked up, smiled, and said, see you tomorrow, singer boy. For a second, it felt like something was about to happen. But then she ran off. I don't know how I'm supposed to sleep tonight.

He missed my track meets. Then he missed my birthday. I woke up excited, but he was already gone. Came home at 2:00am the next morning. He tried apologizing with a gas station cupcake. I told him it was fine, even though I'd cried myself to sleep. After six months of this, I couldn't take it anymore. I asked him to have dinner with me just, just to. He said he was too busy. That's when I snapped. You're ignoring me, I said. I'm not ignoring you. I have a life to live, too. He replied coldly. That sentence broke something in me. I stopped talking to him for three days. Finally, he apologized and said he needed to tell me something important. He wanted me to meet his girlfriend at dinner that Friday. The way he said it was strange, not excited, almost like he was dreading it. Friday came. The doorbell rang at seven PM Dad opened it and said, sweetie, this is my girlfriend. It was Crystal. I screamed, what the hell is she doing here? Crystal stepped forward. Hands up. I know this is uncomfortable. I'm really sorry for how I treated you in high school. I was immature, but I genuinely care about your dad. Dad tried to calm me down. Let me explain how this happened. I don't give a damn about your explanation, I yelled. You tossed me aside for this piece of trash. You're pathetic. Dad's face went red. Don't you dare call her that. I tried to keep this separate from you to make it easier for everyone. But like it or not, Crystal's here to stay. If you can't accept that, you're more than welcome to leave. I went to my room and started packing, called my grandpa, told him everything. He drove over immediately and had a screaming match with dad in the driveway. Dad didn't even try to stop me from leaving. He called for weeks after I blocked him. He showed up at Grandpa's house once. I called the cops. After that, he gave up. 2 years of silence. I started college, made new friends, tried to forget I ever had a father. Then yesterday, I got a text from an unknown number. It's dad. It's urgent. We need to meet, please. I stared at my phone for an hour. Part of me wanted to delete it, but curiosity and maybe a desire to finally tell him off, one, I texted back. This morning where? Luigi's restaurant. Noon. I showed up at 11:55. My hands were shaking when I walked in. I heard someone call my name. I barely recognized him. He looked 10 years older, thinner, gray hair, dark circles under his eyes. Hey, he said quietly. I'd hug you, but I know you'd reject it. His voice was shaking. He LED me to a corner booth away from other people. We sat in silence for a minute. Then I noticed Crystal wasn't There dad pulled out a Manila folder and slid it across the table. Divorce papers. She left me three months after you did, he said. Cleaned out the bank account, took everything. Even the house is gone now. I just stared at him. I chose her over you, he continued, voice cracking. And I lost both of you. I lost my daughter. For someone who never actually cared about me. Tears started rolling down his face. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I don't deserve it. I just needed you to know that I'm sorry, that I was wrong, that losing you was the biggest mistake of my entire life. He pushed a small box toward me. Inside was my mom's wedding ring. She would have wanted you to have this. I should have given it to you on your 18th birthday. I'm two years late.

My wife Rachel was everyone's favorite PTA mom. She had the organic snacks and volunteer sheets and designer yoga pants. Other parents loved her and teachers praised her. Everyone told me how lucky I was. But when my kids heard her car in the driveway, they'd run to their rooms. The wine started at 5 and didn't stop until she passed out. Then she heard our five year old daughter. I had two choices at that point. Let her keep going or stop her permanently. It started with wine. At dinner, Rachel would pour a glass and say, just to unwind, honey. I believed her because why wouldn't I? Then I caught her drinking wine at lunch, and she tried to hide the glass when I walked in. I felt sick, but stayed quiet. Then came the morning. I grabbed her coffee mug by mistake, and vodka burned my throat. The kids were eating cereal right there at the table. Rachel snatched it back and said, that's apple juice. My seven year old son looked at me and his eyes said everything. He knew she was lying, and he knew I knew. I felt like the worst father in the world. The next month got worse fast. The soccer coach called me at work, and his voice was hesitant. Your daughter's still here? Because just ended 30 minutes ago. My hands were Shaking the whole drive there she was, sitting alone on that bench as the last kid, with her shoulders slumped. When she saw me, she said, it's okay, daddy. I knew you'd come. She didn't ask where Mommy was. My baby girl had already given up on her mother, and I cried in the car after dropping her home. The very next Friday, my phone rang during a meeting. Nobody picked up your son again. That word destroyed me, and I realized this had been happening when I wasn't around. I found him in the office, swinging his little legs and trying to look brave. Mommy forgot, he said quietly. The secretary watched me with those knowing eyes. That weekend, my mom visited, and at noon, Rachel grabbed the wall and missed and crashed to the floor. The kids watched their mother sprawled on the ground, unable to stand. My mom's face went cold, and she asked, how long has this been happening? I couldn't speak because saying it out loud meant admitting my failure. Three days later, everything changed for ever. I was shampooing my hair when I heard the scream. Not a normal kid scream, but pure terror. I ran out with soap still in my eyes and saw my daughter holding her arm. The skin was already bubbling from hot oil. Rachel stood there swaying. At eight in the morning? It just slipped, she slurred. At urgent Care, my daughter whimpered while the nurse treated her burns. The nurse kept looking between Rachel and me with eyes that asked why I was letting this happen. That night, I sat by my daughter's bed for hours, watching her sleep with those white bandages. I knew right then that Rachel was never going to stop. And I had to protect my kids.

How could you at 8:15? Richard called. She's in my truck. We're having a conversation about honesty and respect. Is she okay? She's fine. Embarrassed. Trevor nearly wet himself when I knocked open the door. In his boxers with candles lit everywhere. He snorted. Closure, my ass. What now? Now I drive my daughter home. You should pack her things. I'd already started. Jenna came home to find her stuff in boxes by the door. The screaming started immediately. You humiliated me. You called my dad. You asked to sleep with your ex. I said go ahead. You said you understood. I understood perfectly. That's why your stuff's packed. She tried everything. Tears, anger, seduction. Nothing worked. Finally called an Uber to her parents'house. Then Trevor showed up at my job. Skin, jeans, guitar pick, necklace, pushing 30 and dressed like 2008 never ended, bro. I didn't know she was engaged. She said you guys were having problems. So controlled. I let her do whatever she wanted. She's all yours. His face changed. Wait, what? No, I don't want anything serious. It was just going to be one night. Congratulations. Got blocked by consequences. Security escorted him out. Last weekend, I was at a bar when Trevor walked in with Jenna. They were clearly on a date. Her hanging all over him. She saw me and walked over. Marcus, how are you? Great. You got your closure, I see. This isn't. We're just talking. In that dress. Sure. Trevor came back, saw me, tried to steer her away. You threw away our future over nothing? Over you asking to sleep with the guy you're literally on a date with right now? The bar was getting quiet. Hey, Trevor. She tell you she was buying lingerie for your closure session while wearing my engagement ring? Trevor went pale. What engagement ring? The one I gave her six months ago when I proposed. Never looked at Jenna. You said you guys broke up months ago. We were having issues. We had zero issues until you invented one. Jesus Christ, Jenna again? Apparently, this wasn't her first closure request. She pulled this with Trevor, too? Needed closure with her high school ex. Trevor walked out. Just left her there. Jenna turned on me, tears streaming. Look what you did. I didn't ask you to sleep with your ex. You're so petty. I hope you die alone. I'd rather die alone than live with someone who needs to sample other dicks for closure. She threw her drink at me. Security threw her out.

I called my best friends, pretending I was drowning in debt. One told me it was karma. Another said, you're not my problem. But my childhood friend drove 4 hours to help me move my stuff. What I did next changed his entire future. My name is Connor. I'm 31, and I just sold my cyber security software to a Fortune 500 company for $90 Million after taxes. I built it alone in my garage for three years. Nights, I worked at a data center, making $19 an hour. Days, I coded until my eyes burned. No investors, no press. Just me, caffeine, and a dream that felt impossible. Most mornings, the wire hit my account. On a Tuesday at 2:47 p m, I was sitting in a Wendy's parking lot eating a $5 meal when my phone buzzed. I read the number three times. Then I put my head on the steering wheel and just breathed. I didn't call my mom, didn't post online, didn't tell anyone. Because I realized something. Sitting there with my cold fries, I had no idea who actually cared about me versus who cared about what I could do for them. For three years, I'd been the broke friend, the one who couldn't make bachelor parties or split Airbnbs. People stopped inviting me to things. I told myself it was normal. Life gets busy. But now, with more money than I'd ever imagined. I needed to know the truth, so I designed a test. I made a list of three people I'd known since college, people I'd helped, trusted, considered, close. I wrote a simple script. Hey, I'm in trouble. My landlord's evicting me, and I need help moving my stuff by Friday. Can you spare a few hours? That's it? No money involved? Just time and effort. Thursday morning, I called Derek first. Derek and I met freshman year. We were roommates for two years. I'd covered his rent twice when he was between jobs. I'd driven him to the airport at 4 a m. More times than I could count. He picked up on the fourth ring. I gave him my script. He laughed. Not a polite chuckle, a real laugh. Bro, that's karma. You ghosted my fantasy league draft last month. Figure it out yourself. Then he hung up. I stared at my phone like it had just insulted me. Second call. Vanessa. We've been close since sophomore year. Study partners, concert buddies. The kind of friend who knew my coffee order. I'd helped her move twice, dog sat for her. Probably 15 times. I asked her the same thing. Silence. Then Connor, I have Pilates at noon.

I actually laughed out loud. Are you serious right now? I know we didn't part on the best terms, Trent said, finally speaking up, but it's been four years. Surely we can move past. Move past? I pulled out my phone, open the company website, and turn the screen toward them. There was my face, right under the title of CEO with a whole article about how I taken over last year. Celeste's face. Face went completely white. Her hand actually started shaking. That was supposed to be mine, she whispered. You're a history major. You don't know anything about business. Was a history major. I correct to her. Funny thing about betraying your family. Dad decided he'd rather teach someone from scratch than ever speak to you again. Trent stepped forward, his face red. Look, we made mistakes, but we're married now. We have bills, we have a lease, her student loans. Let me get this straight. I interrupted. You stole my fiance, eloped a week before my wedding, and then spent an entire year sending me postcards of yourselves on vacation just to rub it in my face. And now you want me to give you jobs? Those postcards were immature, Celeste admitted, but there was no real apology in her voice. We were young and stupid, but I grew up in that business. I was supposed to inherit it. You can't just. Actually, I can. Dad made it very clear when he signed the company over. To me, there's even a clause that physically prevents you from ever working there. That was a lie. But watching her face crumble was worth it. This is ridiculous, Trent said, getting angry now. We're family. Your parents raised Celeste. They wouldn't want my parents disowned her. After the third postcard, I said coldly, the one where you guys were in Paris? And she wrote, wish you were here with a winky face. So classy, by the way. Celeste's face hardened into that old, familiar sneer from when we were kids. You always were pathetic, she spat. Playing the victim won't change the fact that Trent chose me, that I was better than you, that. Get out! I walked to my door and opened it. You have 10 seconds before I call security. You can't do this, Trent said, but he was already backing toward the door. We need help. Her dad won't even take her calls anymore. Five seconds. Select. S grabbed Trent's arm and pulled him toward the door. As they stepped into the hallway, I heard her hiss at him. I told you this was your fault. If you hadn't insisted. My fault? Trent's voice wrote. You're the one who said your dad would forgive you. You said the business would always be yours. I closed the door before I could hear more of their argument through the door. I could hear them still fighting as they walked down the hallway. Two minutes later, my actual pizza Arrived. The delivery guy asked if I was okay because apparently I was smiling way too big. Just had a really good day, I told him, handing him a 20 dollar tip. I ate my pizza while blocking both their numbers. Four years ago, I was devastated. Today I'm the CEO of a multi million dollar company and they can't even afford their rent. Sometimes Karma doesn't need any help.

I said take all the closure you need. Then I called her dad. Been with Jenna for 3 years, engaged for 6 months. Wedding plan for next spring. Last Tuesday we're having dinner when she drops it. Marcus, I need to tell you something. Trevor reached out last week, her ex, the musician who treated her like garbage for two years. We talking, I realized I never got proper closure with him. There's still unresolved feelings. Unresolved feelings, not love. I love you, but I need to close that chapter properly before we start our life together. How exactly do you close this chapter? She looked at her plate. I need to see him one more time, one night just to get it out of my system. You're asking permission to sleep with your ex. It's about closure. The physical part is just part of that process. I stared at her 3 years ring on her finger, wedding venue booked and she's asking to bang her ex for closure. You know what, Jenna? Take all the closure you need. Her face lit up. Really? You understand? Absolutely. Go right ahead. She launched herself at me, covering my face with kisses. You're amazing. So mature. It's just one night and then we'll be stronger than ever. When were you planning this? Saturday. He has a show Friday night. Perfect. Text me the address. Why? Just wanna Know where you are for safety. She practically skipped to bed. I waited until she was asleep, then found Trevor's address in their text chain. Lots of can't wait to see you with heart emojis. Then I called her dad. Richard's a Marine veteran, owns a construction company. Conservative as hell. We get along great. He's already calling me son Marcus. It's late. Everything okay? Hey, Richard, quick question. Jenna mentioned helping her friend Sarah move Saturday. Did she tell you guys? Pause. She told her mother she's having a spa weekend. I don't want to get in the middle of this, but she's planning to visit Trevor on Saturday. The silence was deafening. Trevor. Her ex, Trevor. Richard had threatened to rearrange Trevor's face when they broke up. Yeah. She says she needs closure. What's the address? I gave it to him. We hung up. Saturday came. Jenna spent two hours getting ready. New lingerie. I saw the tags in the trash. Fresh manicure, the works. I'll be back tomorrow morning. Thank you for being so understanding. Take your time. Get all the closure you need. She left at six PM at 6:45, Richard texted, I'm here. At 7:23, my phone exploded. Jenna calling. I let it ring. Texts flooding in. What did you do? My dad is here.

At first, I didn't recognize her. Her left eye was swollen nearly shut. Bruises covered her arms. She was trembling, mascara streaking down her face. Owen, she whispered. Please. I didn't know where else to go. Every instinct told me to slam the door. She destroyed me, chosen him. But seeing her like that, I couldn't. I let her in, made her tea. She broke down completely. Garrett had changed after the wedding, started monitoring her phone, demanded passwords to all her accounts, controlled every dollar she spent, isolated her from her friends, even her family. He said I was lucky to have him. She stopped, that no one else would want me, that I'd thrown away my chance with you and should be grateful. When she tried to leave last week, he grabbed her by the throat, told her if she left, he'd destroy her, that his lawyers would bury her, that my parents would never believe her over him. She'd finally escaped while he was on a business trip. Nowhere to go, no money of her own, too ashamed to call old friends. Why me, I asked after everything. Because you're the only person I know who understands what he's really like, what they're all really like. She was right. I knew exactly how my family operated, how they protect Garrett. No matter what he did, I could have turned her away. Part of me wanted to, but another part Remembered the man I used to be, the one who believed in doing the right thing, even when it hurt. Get some rest, I said. Tomorrow we're going to the police. The next morning, I drove her to the station. She filed a report, showed them the bruises, the controlling texts, the financial records proving he trapped her. I called a lawyer friend who specialized in domestic cases, helped her file for a restraining order, gave a statement about Garrett's history of manipulation and my parents enabling. Two days later, my mom called. I almost didn't answer. How could you, she screamed. You're destroying your brother's reputation after everything he's given you, given me. I said, he stole my fiance. You supported it, told me he was better for her. Remember, that's different. This is what better looks like, mom. This is the man you chose over me, the one you said would make her happier. Look at her face and tell me you made the right call. Silence. He told me I'd thank him one day. I continued, you were right. I'm thankful. Thankfully showed me exactly who you all are before I wasted more of my life on you. I hung up. Haven't heard from them since. Vanessa's staying with a friend now, restraining order in place. She starts therapy next week.

My dad cheated on my mom for years. She got sick when I was 9 and died four months later, while my mom was sleeping all the time. Because she was so sick, my dad started bringing his girlfriend around. He never officially introduced her to me, but he stopped hiding her from everyone else. Day after my mom's funeral, he moved this woman into our house. Her name was Linda. Six months later, they got married. I was 10 years old, watching my dad marry the woman he cheated with while my mom was dying. I hated both of them. Then I found out it was even worse than I thought. They'd been together since I was, like, 2 or three years old. My entire childhood. This woman was there in the background, ruining my family. Right after they got married, they started trying for a baby. Linda got pregnant pretty fast, but she kept having miscarriages. I'm talking, like, six or seven of them over a few years. A couple of them were really late into the pregnancy, too. After one of the late ones, I came home from school, and Linda was crying on the couch. He'd been there for days, just sobbing and not leaving the house. I walked right past her to go to my room. My dad caught me in the hallway and told me I needed to go comfort my stepmom. I looked at him like he was crazy. She's not my stepmom. She's your mistress, I said. That's when he started yelling at me about staying out of adult business and being respectful. So I told him the miscarriages were adult business and I was staying out of it, just like he wanted. He grounded me for a week. When I was about 13, they had another miscarriage. They sat me down at the kitchen table like it was some big, serious talk. Linda was already crying. Before anyone said anything, my dad told me they lost the baby again, they probably weren't going to be able to give me a little brother or sister. I just stared at them. I didn't cry. I didn't say I was sorry. I didn't do anything. Linda completely lost it. She started sobbing even harder, asking where my sadness was. She kept saying these were my baby siblings that died, and how could I not care? That's when I finally said what I've been thinking for years. I'm not sad, and I never wanted you to have kids together. My dad's face went purple. He spent the next three days trying to make me apologize and take it back, but I wouldn't. Why would I? I meant every word. Linda said. She couldn't be around me if I was going to wish bad things on their babies. So my dad sent me to live with my uncle and aunt. I was 14. And I got kicked out of my own house because I wouldn't pretend to care about my dad's a fair baby. I've been living with my uncle's family.

She didn't even pretend to whisper. She continued by saying that James was so much more naturally charismatic and that it was surprising how different two brothers could be. My father looked appalled. My mother went quiet. My sister actually told Natalie that it was rude, but James. James laughed nervously and tried to change the subject. That's when I snapped. I stood up and asked Natalie directly why she'd spent months making insulting comments about me and why my brother allowed it. I told her that her observations about whether I looked like James were uninformed, frankly, bizarre. I told her that her commentary on my professional abilities and my presence was inappropriate, and that I didn't appreciate her using family gatherings as a platform to demean me. Natalie's face went red. She said I was being overly sensitive. She said she was just stating what she observed and that I clearly had some kind of inferiority complex if I was so bothered by honest feedback. She said she was only trying to help by being truthful. She turned to James and said that I was ruining the evening with my drama and that he should talk to me about my attitude. James shifted uncomfortably. He looked between us and said that maybe we should all just calm down. I asked him directly if he agreed with her, if he thought there was something wrong with how I looked or how I carried myself professionally. He didn't answer. He just said that Natalie didn't mean anything by it and that I was making a bigger deal out of this than it was. I realized in that moment that he chosen her. He chosen someone who actively disrespected his sister over maintaining a relationship with me. Walked out of that house and called him the next day. I told him that I couldn't have a relationship with him as long as Natalie was in his life and actively demeaning me. I told him that his failure to defend me said everything about his character. I gave him an ultimatum. Either he addressed her behavior and set boundaries, or I was done. He called me back two hours later and said that Natalie felt attacked and that she wasn't going to change. He said I needed to accept that this was who she was. I told him that was his choice to make, but I made mine. I hung up and haven't spoken to him since. My parents tried to intervene, but I was clear. I would rebuild my relationship with my brother the moment he stopped allowing his girlfriend to disrespect me. Until then, he'd made his decision.

My professor drops the bomb three weeks before finals that the group project is worth 70% of our grade and we get to pick our own teams. My three best friends since freshman year immediately swore me, like, obviously we're together, right? And honestly, I'm pumped because we always crush projects together. Professor hands us this massive case study about restructuring a failing tech company and says it needs a 30 page analysis plus a 20 minute presentation. I'm already mentally dividing the work when my friend goes, you're so good at this stuff, you should take the lead. And the other two are nodding like bobbleheads. I figure, okay, I'll coordinate everything, assign sections based on everyone's strengths, set up our Google Drive. You know, actual leader stuff. We make this whole show about being the dream team, and the professor even smiles at us saying, this should be interesting. The assignment packet is thick as a textbook, and I'm already highlighting key sections. That night, I create a group chat and mention our first meeting tomorrow at the library. Everyone confirms first meeting. Nobody shows up. I sit there for two hours with my color coded notes and structured timeline. While they're posting Instagram Stories from some party. I text the group, where are you guys? And get back, sorry, emergency came up. You got this, though. Next day in class, they're literally sitting three rows Behind me, whispering and laughing. And when I turn around, they wave like nothing happened. Second meeting attempt. One friend shows up 45 minutes late just to tell me she has to leave for her boyfriend's thing, but email me what I need to do. I created this detailed spreadsheet with everyone's parts, deadlines, research sources. And I get crickets. We two. I head over to eat lunch with them, and over here, why is he being such a try hard about this problem? It's not that deep. And another goes, classic bookworm behaviour. I confront them after class, like, are you guys going to help on the final or not? And they're suddenly all concerned and serious faces. Of course we're working on it. Stop stressing. But then I see them at the professor's office hours without me. Later, the professor even pulls me aside and says, your teammates mentioned you haven't been responding to their attempts to collaborate. That doesn't sound like you. My stomach drops. I show him my phone, the ignored messages, the empty shared documents, and he just nods but says, try to work it out. Group dynamics are part of the grade. A week before the presentation, I check our shared drive. One person uploaded a single paragraph that's literally copy and pasted from Wikipedia. Yeah. I text desperately. Presentation is Monday, we have nothing. And the only response is, relax, we'll figure it out Sunday night. I didn't trust it, so I got To work on my own. Sunday night, 11 p m. I'm putting final touches on the presentation I built alone, when I get an email notification. It's from the professor.

And Lily reached under the picnic table where she'd apparently stashed a backpack we hadn't noticed. She pulled out a purple folder labeled evidence. In her careful handwriting inside were papers, photos and what looked like printed screenshots. She laid them out on the table one by one like she'd practiced this presentation. My dad has been stealing from my college fund for eight months, she said. Clearly, he's gambling online every night. I have bank statements showing he took $23,000. Detective Walsh picked up the first document. It was indeed a bank statement with my name on it showing transfers from an education savings account to my checking account. Natalie made a sound like she'd been punched. I started to speak, but Walsh held up her hand. Lily continued. He told me in river that we'd have money for college, but he's been lying. I checked the account using Mom's computer when she thought I was doing homework. Balance is almost zero now. The next item Lily presented was a printed screenshot showing my laptop screen open to an online poker site. She'd somehow captured it with time stamps showing 2:00am from last Monday. I remembered that night I'd been sure I could win back what I'd lost just one more hand. The screenshot showed my balance negative 40. Eight hundred dollars. He's always on his laptop late at night, Lily explained to the detective. Says he's working, but I Heard him swearing at his computer. I waited until he fell asleep and took pictures with Mom's phone. There were six more screenshots, each from different nights, each showing different gambling sites, each showing me deeper in the hole. The total losses added up to more than just the college fund, way more active. Walsh looked at Natalie. Missus Reeves, did you know about any of this? Natalie shook her head, tears streaming down her face. She'd grabbed river and was holding him so tight he was squirming. I tried to explain that I was going to pay it back, that I just hit a bad streak, that I had a system that would work. But the words sounded pathetic, even to me. Officer Brennan asked if I wanted to stop talking and maybe consult a lawyer. Lily wasn't finished. She pulled out phone records showing something no one had expected.

I was exhausted. My neck hurt. I just wanted to know my baby was okay. I did what I was supposed to do. You're her mother. You should have comforted her. I was comforting her from the front seat. That's not the same. And you know it. What kind of mom just sits there while their baby is hysterical? I turned to look at her. The kind who doesn't want to paralyze their kid if they have a spinal injury. There was no spinal injury. You were just being paranoid. We didn't know that yet, Jessica. That's the whole point. She wouldn't let it go. She kept going on about how I was being cold, how I wasn't maternal enough, how she would never let a baby cry like that. And something in me just snapped. You know what? When you have your own kid and god forbid you're in a crash, you can yank them out of the car seat and do whatever you want. The room went dead silent. Jessica's face went completely white, then red. Her mouth opened, but nothing came out for a second. Are you serious right now? Her voice was shaking. You know, I've been trying for two years. You know about the P C. O. S. You know I might never be able to carry a pregnancy. I did know she'd cried to me about it multiple times, about the failed cycles. The medications, the hope and disappointment every month. That's not what I meant. Yes, it was. You just threw that in my face because you knew it would hurt. She grabbed her purse from the chair. I came here to support you and you're attacking me for caring about Mia. You weren't supporting me. You were criticizing me for doing the right thing. The right thing. You let your baby scream in terror for 15 minutes to protect her spine. Jessica, the paramedic, literally said, I did the right thing. She stood up. I'm calling an Uber. Don't contact me. The doctor came in right as she walked out. Mia was completely fine, no injuries at all. The car seat had done its job perfectly. I drove home alone with Mia sleeping in the back seat and my phone stayed silent for the rest of the night.

At first, we tried writing backwards so if teachers or classmates tried to peek, they couldn't read it quickly. But then we realized if our notebooks ever got confiscated, it would still be easy to figure out. So we went full spy mode. We created a whole alphabet, gave each letter its own symbol and memorized this. Suddenly, we could write full conversations in class and no one had a clue what we were saying. By high school, we didn't really use it anymore, but I still had all the symbols memorized. One day, I was in class journaling about a crush in the back of my notebook. I wasn't disrupting anyone, but my teacher noticed how into it I was and decided to call me out. He goes, what? Are you writing a book over there? Clearly, those aren't notes. I froze, snapped the notebook shut immediately. Thankfully, he just made his little joke and moved on. But there was no way I was about to risk my thoughts about this girl being read out loud to the whole class. The next time I journaled, I switched back to the secret language. To everyone else, it looked like I was just doodling random symbols, but to me, it was the perfect cover. Fast forward years later, I find those old notebooks again. And the problem, I had thrown away the only translator. We ever made, which means all the secrets I wrote as a kid are now locked away forever in a language even I don't understand anymore. Guys, what do I do?

The officers arrived while we were singing Happy Birthday. Two uniformed police and a woman in plain clothes carrying a badge and clipboard walked straight through our backyard gate, while my daughter Lily sat at the head of the picnic table with her hands folded in her lap. Wait! The singing stopped midverse. Seventeen children and their parents froze with cake forks halfway to their mouths. Natalie dropped the camera she'd been using to record the moment. The female officer, whose badge read Detective Walsh, walked directly to Lily and knelt beside her chair. You're the one who called. Lily nodded once, then pointed at me. That's my dad. He needs to be arrested. My hands went numb. The backyard spun. Every parent stared at me with identical expressions of horror and disgust. Miss Missus Pemberton grabbed her twins and started backing toward the gate. Mister Lou pulled out his phone and started recording. I opened my mouth to explain, to defend myself, to say anything that would make sense of what was happening. But nothing came out except a strangled sound that made me look even more guilty. Detective Walsh asked everyone except immediate family to leave, which triggered a mass exodus that felt like being abandoned during a house fire. Parents grabbed their children and ran, leaving behind wrapped presents and half eaten cake. Within 90 Seconds, our backyard went from Celebration to crime scene. Lily's best friend Sophie, was physically carried away by her mother, who shot me a look that could have strip paint. The bounce house rental company guy unplugged his equipment and left without asking for payment. Natalie stood frozen by the cake table, her face completely white. Our son river, who was six, started crying and asking why everyone was leaving his sister's party. Detective Walsh's partner, Officer Brennan, positioned himself between me and Lily like I might lunch for her. I raised my hand slowly, trying to show I wasn't a threat, but the gesture made me look like I was surrendering, which maybe I was.

I'm 16 and I had surgery earlier this year on my shoulder. The doctor said I needed to be really careful during recovery because if someone bumped into me wrong, I could mess up the whole surgery. My parents wanted me to recover at home, but that was never going to work. I have three younger siblings. Two of them have special needs and don't really understand personal space. My 9 year old brother will just run up and tackle you without warning. My 13 year old sister gets over stimulated and sometimes pushes people. Then there's my 10 year old brother who acts out constantly because my parents are always dealing with the other two. He'll throw things, slam doors, wake everyone up at 4:00am screaming about something random. It's chaos 24 7 at my house. My grandparents offered to let me stay with them during recovery and honestly, it saved my life. Their house was quiet. I could actually sleep through the night. Nobody was barging into my room or messing with my stuff. It felt like I could finally breathe. The doctor said I needed about two months to recover, but I stayed for three and a half months. I know I could have gone home earlier, but I didn't want to. At my grandparents house, they actually talked to me, like real conversations about my day, what I was thinking. About what I wanted to do after high school. At home, the only time my parents talked to me was to tell me to go pick up food for everyone or watch one of my siblings while they dealt with the other ones. After a few weeks with my grandparents, I started feeling better and asked if I could cook for them. I've been learning recipes in my home economics class at school but only got to try them once in class. My grandparents said yes, as long as I took it easy. I made them this chick in pasta dish for my first try and they loved it. My grandma kept saying it was restaurant quality and my grandpa asked me to make it again the next week. For the first time ever, I felt like I was actually good at something. I kept cooking for them a few times a week and it became my favorite thing to do. They'd sit at the table and tell me how good everything smelled while I was cooking. Then we'd eat together and talk about our day. It felt normal, like what families are supposed to be like. Eventually, my parents started pushing me to come home. They'd show up unannounced to check on me. The last few times they came over, they arrived right when I was making dinner. They'd watch me cook and then leave without saying much. Finally, they told me I had to come home or there Would be consequences not just for me, but for my grandparents, too. That felt like a threat. So I moved back home. For two weeks, everything was normal. Then one night, my mom asked why I never cooked for them like I did for my grandparents. My dad jumped in saying I could save them hundreds of dollars a week on takeout if I just made dinner. I told them I didn't want to cook four separate meals every night.

Mother in law then looks at husband and says, yes, do you have the paternity test? I am not apologizing until I'm proven wrong and we both know I'm right. You cannot be the father and the fact that you have now apparently made two girls is ridiculous. Husband, what the f is wrong with you? I start to cry and go get out to grab my things and go to the car. Mother in law, oh, no, you don't. She around the table and grabs shirt, then proceeds to scream at me, how dare you try to run away from this. You're a cheater and you need to own up to this problem. Husband screams at her to get her hands off of me and starts to make his way towards us. She then decides that I cannot be allowed to leave at any cost with her son. She slaps me across my face and then gets in between me and his mom and starts to scream at her. Husband is furious and I'm crying hysterically. He grabs my hand and we're making our way to the door and mother in law grabs a snow globe from a shelf and throws it directly at me. It connects me in the back of my head. I felt to my knees from the pain. And 4 husbands can put together what just happened. She is grabbing anything she can. Find to throw in my direction. I'm on my knees on the ground holding my head with one hand and my belly with the other. Husband is screaming at the top of his lungs for her to stop and she proceeds to try get close enough to kick me. Thankfully, she is old and in bad health so she loses momentum quickly. And as the last resort, husband pushes his mom and she falls back into a shelf by the front door and he rushes me out. He drives me to the hospital and I end up getting 6 stitches in my head and being monitored in hospital for 4 days. The baby ended up being fine and the hospital demanded we file a police report. We find out that when her husband pushed his mom into the shelf, she ended up breaking two fingers and is claiming the excessive force hurt her neck very badly. Cops showed up and took our side of the story and compared our own report that we filed. Once at the hospital, they told us that mother in law is demanding to press charges against husband for assault while we are pressing charges against her. So then my husband gets arrested but then quickly released after father in law is forced to tell the truth and mother in law then gets arrested. Father in law is now begging us to drop the charges as no one was hurt and that we are being cruel. To lock up an elderly woman. We are currently at home waiting for baby No. 2 to arrive. I'm on a strict bed rest order and husband has taken a week off of work to help pamper me and take care of our first daughter. I asked hundred if once baby No. 2 arrives, we get paternity test for both girls to send to his mom in jail as a huge f u. He thinks it's a hilarious idea and thinks we should also make copies and send them to all the relatives who are entertaining his mom's craziness, along with a written letter saying goodbye, that none of them will ever see us or his daughters again, and that he hopes they're all happy knowing that they ruined any chance they had to have a relationship with him or our children ever again.

I was at the mall on Christmas Eve, last minute shopping for my wife when I heard a commotion at the shoe store. A kid, maybe 10 years old, was standing at the register with a pair of silver heels, counting out crumpled bills and loose change on the counter. The cashier was shaking her head, sweetie, you're about $40 short. I'm sorry. The kid's face fell. He started recounting the money desperately like maybe he'd missed something. Please, I need these. It's for my mom. It has to be these ones. The cashier looked genuinely sorry but firm. I can't just give you a discount like that store policy. I watched this kid's hands shaking as he counted the same bills again, $8, $12, $23. The total was 65. He was nowhere close. People were starting to stare and whisper, getting uncomfortable. I was supposed to be grabbing my wife's gift and getting out of there. But something about this kid's desperation made my feet stop moving. I walked over to the register before I even realized what I was doing. Hey, buddy, how much are you short? The kid looked up at me with red eyes. $32, but I don't have it. I've been saving for three months and it's still not enough. He was trying not to cry in front of everyone. I pulled out my wallet. What if I help you out? Consider it a Christmas present. His eyes went wide. Really, you do that? I nodded and handed the cashier my card. While she rang it up, I asked him why these specific shoes were so important. That's when he told me everything. His mom was in the hospital, stage 4 cancer. The doctor said she had days, maybe a week at most. She always wanted nice shoes like this, he I said quietly, staring at the silver heels. But she spent all her money on me, new shoes for school, clothes, everything I needed. She never bought anything for herself, his voice cracked. I want her to have something nice, something she always wanted, even if it's just for a little while. The cashier was crying now, too, trying to hide it while she bagged the shoes. I looked at this kid, this ten year old boy who was about to lose his mother, spending his last Christmas Eve trying to buy her a gift she'd never have time to wear. Where's the hospital, I asked. I'll drive you. We got in my car and he clutched that shoebox the whole way. She told me not to worry about Christmas, he said quietly, but I know she's sad. I can tell. Twenty minutes later, we pulled up to the hospital. He thanked me about a dozen times before getting out. Something made me follow him inside. We took the elevator to the oncology floor. He LED me to the room. Through the window, I could see a woman in the bed, impossibly thin, hooked up to machines. She looked like she was sleeping. The kid hesitated. What if she's too tired? I put my hand on his shoulder. It's Christmas Eve. She'll wanna see you. We walked in quietly. Mom, he whispered. Her eyes opened slowly, and when she saw him, her whole face lit up. Baby, you're here. He held up the shoebox with taking hands. I got you something for Christmas. She looked confused as he pulled out the silver heels. Her hand went to her mouth. Sweetheart, where did you. And she understood. She started crying. You saved your money for me? Yes, he said firmly. You always said you wanted pretty shoes. Can I try them on you? She nodded. Still crying. He carefully helped her sit up on the edge of the bed, took off her hospital socks and gently slid the heels onto her feet. They fit perfectly. She stared down at them, tears streaming. Beautiful. Can you stand up, he asked. I want to see them on you. She looked hesitant, gripping his shoulder. I don't know if I can, baby. Just try, he said, please. She took a breath and slowly pushed herself up, one foot on the ground, then the other. She was standing. She took one small step, then another. I'm wearing fancy shoes, she whispered, laughing through tears. Look at me. A nurse walked in, saw what was happening. And froze. Her face went pale. She rushed over. Mrs. Porter, you're walking. The mom looked confused. I wanted to see my son's gift. The nurse's voice cracked. You couldn't move your legs this morning, the doctor said. You'd never walk again. Everyone in the room went still. The mom was standing there in her silver heels, holding her son's hand, tears running down her face. A doctor came running in minutes later. He examined her, checked her charts, looked at her legs in complete disbelief. This isn't possible, he kept saying. The scans.

We met during my PhD program. I was finishing mechanical engineering. She was getting her masters in education. Vanessa always said she was attracted to my intelligence. She'd never met someone who could match her intellectually. We got married after two years of dating. Last year, Vanessa started talking about kids. She made spreadsheets about optimal conception windows, prenatal vitamins, genetic markers. I want to give our children every advantage, he'd say. I thought she was just thorough. We tried for 8 months with no success. Then she suggested genetic testing to identify potential issues. Both our tests came back perfect. No hereditary concerns, excellent markers. I remember her staring at my results for a long time, expression unreadable. Three months later, she announced she was pregnant. I was over the moon. Built a crib from scratch, took maternity leave, planning courses. Vanessa seemed distant, always on her phone, frequently working late. When I'd ask if everything was okay, she blamed pregnancy hormone. At her baby shower, one of her teacher colleagues made a strange comment. Must be nice knowing the father is so accomplished. She said it looking directly at Vanessa with this knowing smirk. Vanessa went pale. That night. I went through her phone for the first time, found emails dating back 14 months to Doctor Marcus Chen, a geneticist at Stanford. Started professionally, she'd reached out about educational genetics resources. Then The emails evolved. She asked about his research, his family health history. He sent credentials, published papers, genetic test results. Vanessa wrote, your genetic markers are remarkable, 99th point seven percentile cognitive performance, no disease markers, exceptional longevity gene. This is exactly what I've been looking for. His response, I'm married. What are you proposing? Her reply, a purely practical arrangement. My husband has good gene.

After four days and three nights, my dad found me and took me back home. I didn't really care about them as they got older. I was always arguing with my parents. Nothing crazy, just normal teenager stuff like coming home past curfew or forgetting to do my chores. But one Tuesday afternoon in March, everything changed. Got home from school and my dad was waiting by the front door with his keys in his hand. Get in the car, he said. His voice was flat. What? Why? Just get in. I threw my backpack in the back seat and we drove in silence for 20 minutes. He pulled into the Greyhound bus station downtown and handed me a twenty dollar Bill. See ya, he said and pointed at the door. Dad, what are you doing? You'll figure it out. Then he just sat there, staring straight ahead until I got out. He drove away before I even closed the door. All the way I stood there holding that twenty dollar Bill, watching his car disappear around the corner. It. It was 3:47 in the afternoon. I know because I kept checking the clock on the bank across the street, thinking he'd come back any minute. He didn't. The first night I slept behind a dumpster at a grocery store. I bought a sandwich and a Gatorade with some of the money and I used the bathroom at a McDonald's to wash my face in the morning. On the second day, I walked to my friend Kyle's house. His mom opened the door and her face went white. When I told her what happened. You're staying here, she said immediately. She didn't even ask questions. I slept on Kyle's couch for two nights. His mom made me pancakes and asked if I wanted to call anyone. I said no. On the fourth day, someone knocked on the door around noon. Kyle's mom answered it, and I heard my dad's voice in the hallway. My wife made me come get him. Let's go. That was it. No apology, no explanation. I grabbed my backpack and followed him to the car. We drove home in silence, just like the drive to the bus station. When we got there, my mom was making dinner like nothing happened. Fast forward to now. My parents are in their 70s. My dad needs help getting up the stairs. My mom keeps calling me asking if I can drive them to doctor appointments. Last month, she called and said they were thinking about moving to a retirement community and wanted my opinion. I don't

Sometimes you get caught and sometimes you don't. Well, this one time we had to take one of the most important exams of the year. I hadn't revised at all. So when one of my friends came up a few hours before the test saying, yo, I found the Mark scheme, I thought I was saved. He swore it was the real thing. So I walked into the exam hall confident. Teachers were patrolling. The pressure was heavy, but I had the answers. So I'd pull out my phone under the desk and start copying straight down question 1, question 2. I'm flying through, but then I get question 8 and realize something feels off. The numbers and variables in the paper don't match anything on the Mark scheme. I check back through what I've already written and every single answer is wrong. This goofball gave me the Mark scheme to a completely different exam. I got five minutes left, 80% of my paper is nonsense and I'm panicking. Then the teacher says, close your papers and leave them on the desk. So you know what I did? I slipped mine into my pocket and threw it in a trash bin. Down the road a few days later, the teacher's handing out marked papers and mine's obviously missing. So I put on the greatest performance of my life. I say, miss, I didn't get mine. She goes, are you sure? And I'm Like, yes, miss, she sighs and says, oh, I must have mixed it up in another pile. Now we're flipping through stacks of papers together, me acting heartbroken with fake tears in my eyes. She starts apologizing like crazy, convinced she lost it. And in the end, she goes, listen, I'm very sorry. I must have lost it somewhere. Would a be a good Mark for you? So yeah, I cheated, threw away my test and still got almost full Mark.

When she woke up, I handed her the emails. Were you going to tell me before or after I signed the birth certificate? She sat down, hand on her belly. You don't understand. This wasn't about you. Doctor Chen's cognitive genetics are published research. I wanted our child to have every advantage. That's what good mothers do. You mean committing paternity fraud? It's not fraud. If you never intended harm, she said calmly, you would have been a father to an exceptional child. You would have been happy. I filed for divorce. The next day. Her lawyer demanded child support. My lawyer subpoenaed Doctor Chen who denied everything until we showed him the emails from his university account. He'd violated Stanford's ethics policies and was ended.

She suggested the four of us raise the child together like a modern intellectual collective. Baby was born last month.

Vanessa lost her teaching job. Doctor Chen lost tenure. Last week she texted, he has your eyes. I was wrong about genetics. Personality matters more than markers. I blocked her.

Then she put her hands on me at 8 months pregnant. No girl has been born in my husband's family for over a century. Everyone jokes that the men in his family just don't make daughters. On our wedding night, my m L. Stared me down and said, now go give us our son. Don't let us down. I nervously laughed and we parted over our honeymoon when we got pregnant with a baby girl. Everyone was so shocked when we announced it was a girl and most of the family denied it up until the moment she was born. That's when the horrible comment started. Whenever my husband isn't around, mother in law and her family members will make snarky comments like, I wonder where she got that nose. It's definitely not the husband. Well, as it would happen, we are now expecting our second baby and yeah, it is another girl. I begged my husband not to tell the mother in law the gender when we found out as I just wanted to enjoy a bit more of this pregnancy before she ruined it. I had decided to keep them mean comments his mother made to me about our first daughter to myself as she's old and in poor health and I felt guilty about potentially ruining their relationship and she probably doesn't have many years left to be around. Regardless, he insists on Announcing it at our next visit and we do exactly that. As soon as she heard it with another girl, tears welled in her eyes and she started shaking her head back and forth and sobbing. She then started yelling at me, called me a cheater and demanded I get out of her house. The husband immediately stands up and starts yelling at her, asking what her problem is and that she needs to apologize to me and watch her mouth in front of her grandkids. She says, through broken whales, not ours, not ours. Those girls are not ours. She's a cheater. A cheater. My son did not make those girls. I start crying hysterically and pick up my daughter who is utterly confused as to why daddy is yelling at grandma and Mommy is now crying. Mother in law then looks at me and starts yelling, I let you get away with it the first time I took you and his family. I allowed my son to believe he fathered that stupid girl, but I will allow it again. Husband is now heated. He gets extremely mad and starts screaming at her that she is out of line and how dare she call his daughter names. He then goes on to say that we are leaving and until she comes to her senses, she will never see any of us again. She tried to say something more, but he cuts her off and yells at her by the Way, mom, I love that little girl more than I ever loved you. As he is shuttling us out the door, I cried and cried and wrote down and told husband all the little comments she and her family have said to me when he's not around while we drive the two hours home we went. No contact for a few months and everything seemed to be going great. Then when I was nearing my date, we decided to be the bigger person and reach out to her and offer her a chance to make things right. She wind and winds that she misses husband and granddaughter. We agreed to meet for dinner at their house after a few weeks for a proper talk and apology from her. We arrived, dinner is served and we are trying to make small talk and husband says, yeah, mom, this is all been nice, but we need to talk about what happened and the things you said last time you were here.

What makes you think that your wife is mad or insane? Mister Waters asks. Instead, she tried to stab me with a knife, poisoned me through my food with my nut allergy by cooking with nut oil and sprinkling nuts within the food. Thank the Lord I had my Epipen on me and the child missing was before we married, which I didn't find out until six months ago, I explained. The detective's eyes are now narrowed. The same time you filed for divorce? As he slid the divorce paperwork to me, yes, I answered. Why? Mister Waters continued to dig. I wet my lips slowly because she told me the child had died. It didn't feel right with me. The detective suddenly looked concerned at me. Is there a chance your wife forged your signatures? Honestly, sir, nothing would surprise me at this point, I answer as honestly and as truthfully as I can. Please wait here. The detective sweeps the files back into the folder and leaves the room. Cassie wouldn't have forged my signatures, I pause, staring at the desk. Or would she? Ow. First pace. Once again, I start pacing back and forth through the room. She couldn't have hurt her own child, but why tell me the child died when the officers only have a missing case on the child? I muttered to myself as I pace. The door opens to see Detective Waters again, only this time he's extremely pale. We Are sorry for detaining you, Quinn. You are free to go. What? What changed? I asked, staring at Detective Waters. Your wife, if Cassie confessed to forging your signatures, she also forged your signatures and had unalived her child. By forging your signature, she was able to hide her child's body by cremation. I felt sick to my stomach. She was going to unalive me, wasn't she? I asked. The detective looks that way, Quinn. Blunt and brutal honesty. As soon as I left the police station, I immediately went to the courthouse with the documents Detective Waters had given me. I needed to voice and restraining order ASAP, I told the receptionist. She nods. Are you Mister Black? Yes, I answered. Detective Waters contacted us and the judge is waiting for you.

So I'm like 6 months pregnant and my husband Kyle and I have been keeping our baby name super secret. We've picked Emmitt for a boy and Nora for a girl. But every single family gathering turns into this crazy interrogation session about what we're naming the kid. My mother in law, Janet, is the worst. She'll literally corner me by the kitchen sink and be like, just give me a hint, honey. I promise I won't tell anyone. Meanwhile, she's already told half the neighborhood that I'm having twins because she misheard something at dinner three weeks ago. Then there's my sister Emma, who keeps suggesting names like Braxton and Nivea because apparently normal names aren't creative enough anymore. And don't even get me started on Kyle's brother who keeps pushing for family names. He wants us to name our kid after their dead Uncle Mortimer. Like, dude, it's 2025, not 1825. The breaking point was last Sunday at my in law's house. I'm trying to eat my potato salad in peace when Janet goes, I have a feeling it's going to be Theodore. Doesn't she look like she's carrying a Theodore? And then Emma chimes in with, no way. That baby is definitely a Paisley. Meanwhile, Kyle's cousin starts going on about how we should honor the family tradition and Kyle's dad is nodding along like this is some kind of democracy vote. I looked at Kyle across the table and He had this look like he wanted to crawl under the furniture. That's when I decided enough was enough. So I stood up, put my hands on my belly, all dramatic like and announced, you know what, you guys have been so invested in this, I think you deserve to know. Everyone got quiet real fast. We've narrowed it down to three names, I said, making eye contact with each person. For a boy, we're thinking either Bartholomew, Nebuchadnezzar or Gaylord. And for a girl, it's between Brunhilda, Bertha or Methuselah. Kyle nearly choked on his iced tea and its face went completely white. Emma just stared at me with her mouth hanging open like she'd seen a ghost. Brunilda, Janet whispered, like the opera. It's very traditional, I said. Completely straight faced. European heritage and all that. The room was dead silent for like 10 seconds. Then Kyle's brother goes, Gaylord. Are you serious right now? It's a perfectly respectable name. Kyle jumped in, catching on. Very distinguished. What happened next was beautiful chaos. Janet.

At first, we tried writing backwards so if teachers or classmates tried to peek, they couldn't read it quickly. But then we realized if our notebooks ever got confiscated, it would still be easy to figure out. So we went full spy mode. We created a whole alphabet, gave each letter its own symbol, and memorized it. Suddenly, we could write full conversations in class, and no one had a clue what we were saying. By high school, we didn't really use it anymore, but I still had all the symbols memorized. One day, I was in class journaling about a crush in the back of my notebook. I wasn't disrupting anyone, but my teacher noticed how into it I was and decided to call me out. He goes, what, are you writing a book over there? Clearly those aren't notes. I froze, snapped the notebook shut immediately. Thankfully, he just made a little joke and moved on. But there was no way I was about to risk my thoughts about this girl being read out loud to the whole class. So the next time I journaled, I switched back to the secret language. To everyone else, it looked like I was just doodling random symbols, but to me, it was the perfect cover. Fast forward. Years later, I find those old notebooks again. And the problem? I have thrown away the only Translator we ever made. Which means all the secrets I wrote as a kid are now locked away forever in a language even I don't understand anymore. Guys, what do I do?

Only when guys stop staring at it, she said without looking up. Her name was Viola. We talked between her photo breaks. She quit her job to run her own photography business. Best decision I ever made. Worst financially, but best overall. Two days later, we met for coffee. The first date turned into three. She was busy, focused. Expected time. No drama, no testing boundaries. Just quiet consistency. A year later, we were eating dinner. At our table, she mentioned maybe doing more travel shoots next year. That's good, I said. You build things fast. Trying to. Why? I took out the ring box, put it next to her fork. Because I'd rather build than rebuild. She froze, then laughed quietly. You really don't do speeches, do you? Not my department, yes, she said simply. Two weeks after we posted engagement photos, Laura started appearing again. Fake social media accounts, then emails about unfinished business. Then fake one star reviews on Viola's photography business. When Laura showed up at Viola's studio demanding a walk in session, we called police. He was escorted out, yelling about false narratives. I filed for a permanent restraining order. The wedding day started quiet. Small venue in the Berkshires, 50 people. Viola walked down the aisle, sunlight hitting her dress. We met halfway, held hands. Ten minutes into the ceremony, the doors opened. Laura, Red Dress, grocery store bouquet. Eyes glossy. Smile too wide. Ace. She called out that Ring was supposed to be mine. I'm the real bride. Every head turned. Viola's hand stayed in mine, tight but not shaking. Laura kept walking down the aisle. You promised me that ring. You can't marry her! I didn't move. Security! We'd hired guards and briefed them. They stepped from the side doors. You can't pretend I don't exist! Laura shouted as they reached her. Escort her out, I said calmly. She tried to twist free, still yelling. Outside, blue lights. Two officers we'd already briefed about the restraining order. The door shut. Room went quiet. I turned to the guests. Sorry for the delay. Someone got the wrong venue. Laughter broke out. Awkward at first, then real. Let's pick it up from the vows, I said. Viola squeezed my hand once and smiled. We finished the ceremony. By the time we stepped outside for photos, the police car was gone.

I said, go ahead. Then I handed her my unlocked phone. Then I asked for her phone and she started panicking. My girlfriend thought she was slick. I'm 32, she's 29. We've been together over two years, living together eight months. Last Thursday, I'm on the couch watching the game. She walks in, dead serious, stands in front of the TV and goes, we need to talk. I'm going through your phone tonight to see if you're loyal. Excuse me. Out of nowhere, her best friend Brittany just caught her man cheating. So now Natalie thinks all men are trash. I just said, okay, unlocked my phone and handed it over. She looked shocked. I didn't fight back. But then she went full FBI, texts, Instagram, Snapchat, email, even my bank apps like I was venmoing a mistress. You know what she found? Fantasy football trash talk, 900 photos of my dog, me googling how to fix a running toilet. She was annoyed my phone was boring. So I said, cool, my turn. Her whole body stiffened. She hugged her phone like it was a bomb. No, that's different. Different how? Because I'm not cheating. And I said, neither am I. So hand it over. Then she started crying, actual tears. I can't believe you do this to me, girl. You just combed through my phone for 20 minutes. And she pulled the classic fine if you Don't trust me. Maybe we shouldn't be together. And I said, okay. She thought I'd beg. Nope. She storms off, slams the bedroom door. 20 minutes later, she comes back out sobbing. I deleted some texts. Okay. Are you happy? Texts from who? Silence. Saturday, she finally admitted Jake, her ex, the one who meant nothing, the one she never talks to anymore. Yeah, him. I asked how long. She said months. I asked if they were flirty. She said no. Then some might look bad out of context. Show me. I deleted them. Cool. Check the recently deleted folder. Her face went white. How do you know about that? Because I'm not an idiot. She refused. I told her to pack her stuff. She called Britney crying. He's being abusive. He's demanding my phone. And Britney goes, girl, didn't you just go through his phone? Natalie? That's different. Even Britney was like, no, no, it's not. Monday, I get a text from Jake, bro.

Second, did she tell you she went through my phone and refused to hand hers over because she was hiding text with her ex? Her mom, she deserves privacy. Women don't cheat like men do. I laughed so loud she hung up. By Saturday, Natalie shows up with Britney and two random dudes for muscle. Like I'm about to fight her over throw pillows. I already boxed her stuff. Bubble wrapped her succulents organized, labeled. She starts digging. Where's my grandmother's ring? In the jewelry box. Blue pouch. She found it. Look disappointed. And she tries, what about my half of the deposit? You didn't pay a dime, not even on the lease. Her little bodyguard goes, that's illegal, bro. So I pulled up receipts, texts from when she begged not to be added to the lease. Even Britney laughed. Then Natalie tries her last move. I'll show you the text if you take me back. Wait. Text you swore were permanently deleted. You magically have them now. She pulls out her phone. She had screenshots. So she lied again. I saw enough. Jake telling her he missed her. Her saying she thought about him. Him asking if she was happy with me. Her saying it's complicated. Coffee dates. She told me were work meetings, flirty selfies. She swore it wasn't physical. Doesn't matter. That's cheating. Even her hired muscle shook his head, yo, that's messed up. Turns out she paid them $50 each to look intimidating. I laughed so hard I almost thanked her for the comedy show. Even Britney shook her head. Nat, you played yourself. And the karma. Jake ghosted her, didn't even want her when she was single, told her she only wanted him as a backup plan. Now she's texting me at 2:00am. I messed up. I was projecting. I love you. Nah, you loved rent money. You love texting your ex while I paid for everything. That's not love. Her new man, she pulled the same stunt, tried to check his phone. After 3 weeks, he dumped her instantly. Pattern behavior. So, yeah, she demanded to search my phone while hiding an emotional affair with her ex. Tried to gaslight me. Brought hired muscle to move out, lied about deleting texts and ended up alone. And me, I've got peace, me, my dog and receipts.

So I called the authorities because he didn't know that the price of the Lego cost their entire savings. My ex and I divorced three years ago. She was cheating. But at this point, I don't care about the relationship anymore. The pending lawsuit has nothing to do with her or him, but rather their actions. My ex and I have a son, 13 months, that we split time with 50 50. He's a great kid. That interests have changed a lot, to be honest, as I imagine more kids, teenagers tend to do through the years. One thing my son was heavily into at some point was Legos. He used to play with them all the time. Personally, I think they're a great toy for different reasons. I used to love playing them with him. And to this day, I still collect boxes that I leave unopened as a collection. Well, when my ex and I divorced, she got with someone who loved Legos more, I guess. From what I know, he loves making creations and building the sets in I don't care. Seems cool. He does one thing I think is very, very weird. He uses crazy glue so the sets can't break or pieces can't be lost. It seems so weird to me. Issue is I was out of town for all of 3 days last week for medical reasons and my son wanted to Get his PS four so he could play it at his mom's. This isn't out of the ordinary at all. And he has a key so he let me know he would be stopping over for it. I told him to have fun. When I saw him on the entry camera, my wife's husband was with him, which was a no no. I told him via speaker to not go in and to wait on the porch. He flinched but walked in anyway. I sent my ex a text telling her to call him and tell him he's one minute away from a cop call. He left my home with a bag in hand, which I didn't think much of because my son had his games too. My son texted me later that evening and said he didn't know it at the time, but he's pretty sure stepdad took some of my sets. These are all old sets and 2 are worth big money. When I got home, I confirmed the missing sets and called my ex. He had no idea, but he admired he took them, but it was so son could have the sets to complete his collection. My son doesn't even like Legos anymore and told his mom he wouldn't steal from me. My wife asked how much it would cost to replace them and unfortunately it's more than their savings. Actually. It would take their house down payment plus more. I told them if they didn't Pay in 2 weeks. I was suing and pressing charges. The price in the sets makes it a felony. My ex and her husband are saving for a house which would give my son more space when he's there. But those sets were going help pay for his education someday or a home of his own. I filed the police report and have talked to a lawyer and we're moving forward with the suit. Everyone is calling me a joke because they are just toys, but I don't get it. They are worth real money. I'm not rich guys. I needed those to help with my son's future. But again, taking this money does deny my son things at his mom's house. I've been asked to add these facts. The sets have been opened which more than half their worth and one was glued together. The damage was done already. The stolen items are King's Castle, Milk Truck, Lego Land Train, carousel and the glued one was a Star Wars snow speeder. Some of these are one piece of a larger set. So if you lose one of five, you lose the value of one produce plus the value of the set as a whole. Update. Around four PM, I called the local state police and met at their facility. I gave them all I had and gave my statement. My son is with me.

So my sister in law Jenny is literally the most intimidating person I've ever met. She shows up to family stuff maybe twice a year tops. And when she does, she barely talks to anyone. My mom swears Jenny's dad was in her high school class and he had this dead eyed stare that made teachers scared of him. She's convinced the guy's actually dangerous or something. Jenny does this thing where she just stares at you not like a normal look, like she's studying you and finding every weak spot you got. It makes you feel like you're 2 inches tall and the dumbest person alive. My brother Kyle is totally fine with it. Somehow he thinks she's just shy or whatever, but the rest of us try to avoid her. Last month they had a baby, a little girl named Avery. She's 9 months old now and honestly pretty cute with dark hair and these big round eyes. Kyle invited me over to their place for lunch and I figured I should try to bond with my niece since I barely see her. I got there around noon and Jenny was in the kitchen doing dishes. She gave me that look when I walked in, didn't say hi or anything, just that stare. Kyle was way more normal about it and handed me Avery after like 10 minutes of small talk the second I took her. She locked eyes with me, same exact stare as her mom. Not crying or fussing, just staring straight into my soul like she was judging every choice I ever made. This baby who can't even walk yet made me feel like I failed a test I didn't know I was taking. Panicked and just said it out loud. Jesus Christ, it's genetic. Kyle stopped mid sentence. Jenny turned around from the sink. I realized what I said and tried to hand Avery back real quick. Sorry, I, uh, I gotta use the bathroom. I didn't actually go to the bathroom. I just walked out to the living room and pretended to check my phone. Kyle followed me out there like 2 minutes later. He had this look on his face like I just insulted his whole bloodline. What the hell was that about? I tried to play it off. What was, what about you acting like there's something wrong with my daughter because she looked at you. I didn't say anything was wrong with her. You literally said it's genetic like she's got some disease. That's not what I meant. She just has the same look as Jenny and it caught me off guard.

She showed up at my apartment with Megan to practice being calm. Ten minutes later, Megan's elbow shattered my living room mirror. Shards of glass everywhere. This is what happens when you stress her out, mom shouted. She's picking up on your rejection the night before the wedding. Dad called. Your mother's planning to come anyway, she says. You can't stop a mother from seeing her daughter's wedding. I knew she meant it. For 28 years, she'd made sure I knew my place. Megan's punching bag, both literally and emotionally. But I wasn't 7 anymore. The morning of my wedding, my hands trembled as I applied lipstick. It hit me that this day would either be everything I dreamed of or the final break with my family. So when mom and Megan arrived early, I took a deep breath and smiled like nothing had ever been wrong. I'm so glad you made it, I said, hugging them both. You have to see how beautiful everything turned out. I showed them around the lobby, painting out the flowers and the way the sunlight hit the stained glass. The bridal suites over here. I said, keeping my tone light, you can see the aisle from this angle. It's perfect, right? Then I LED them toward the nursery. And remember the room I mentioned, the one with the perfect view of the ceremony? You'll love this. The room was just as I planned, soft lighting, padded carpet, a big screen. Showing the ceremony room, I smiled as they stepped inside. It's soundproof, I said. Parents can bring their babies here and still hear everything from the main hall. Mom walked in first, Megan close behind, still talking about the decorations. I'll step out to the reception hall and say something so you can test how well it works, I said. Keeping my tone light, they both nodded. Turning toward the screen, I slipped out, pulled the door closed and turned the lock. For a second, I just stood there, palm flat against the cool metal, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. 28 years of being the good daughter ended with one small click. The pounding started immediately. Moms muffled yelling, Megan's ha, ha, ha echoing through the padded walls. But those walls were built to muffle crying babies, and they worked. I walked back to the bridal suite. The makeup artist glanced up, startled at my calm face. For the first time in my life, silence didn't mean waiting for the next outburst. It meant peace. When I I stepped into my dress, it felt like armor. An hour later, I stood at the altar, watching Max's face as he read his vows. His voice never wavered. Every word exactly as he'd written them, exactly as I dreamed. The ceremony was perfect, silent, safe. After the reception, I played dumb. Oh, my god, that door's been sticking. I told the venue about it last week. Thank goodness you could Watch on the screen. Mom's face turned red. She didn't speak, just glared like I'd committed murder. After I forced her to watch Max's parents walk me down the aisle. Before mom left the church that day, she cornered me, her face twisted with rage. You're dead to me, she hissed. I smiled.

Sabrina has been deaf since birth and right hand dominant her entire life. When we were kids, we made a pact. If she ever signed with her left hand, it meant danger. Real danger. We were dramatic kids who watched too many spy movies, so we shook on it. Pinky promised. Left hand equals help me. 23 years and she'd never used it once. Every Sunday dinner would be at my parents house. Sabrina arrived with Brandon, my childhood best friend, everyone's favorite. He'd Learned ASL to date her, and my parents called him their bonus son. At the table, Sabrina barely ate while Brandon cut her food without asking. Kept her eyes down the entire meal, shrinking into herself. After dessert, she hugged me goodbye and her left hand came up to sign I love you. My Spidey sense tingled. She pulled back fast, refusing to meet my eyes. Brandon appeared beside her, signing and speaking simultaneously. I grabbed her arm and she flinched hard. Stay longer, I said. Brandon laughed that easy laugh everyone trusted. Three hours is enough, man. I looked directly at Sabrina, ignoring him. Do you want to stay? She glanced at Brandon first before shaking her head. And that one glance told me everything I needed to know. I didn't let go of her arm. I'm asking her, not you, my dad. Walked over from the kitchen. Going on? Sabrina signed with her right hand. I'm fine. But the hand trembled visibly. Brandon squeezed her shoulder, and she went completely rigid, her face draining of all colour. This girl who used to argue with everyone just stood there, silent and terrified. My mom appeared from the dining room. What's happening? I stared at my sister, really seeing her for the first time tonight. She lost 20 pounds, wore long sleeves in July, had dark circles under her eyes. I need to talk to Sabrina alone. My mom's face hardened instantly. After everything Brandon has done for this family. Brandon held up his hands in that patient gesture everyone loved so much. Sabrina, do you want to talk to your brother alone? Sabrina looked at him, then at me, then shook her head. She was too scared to say yes. Show me your arms, Sabrina. The room went completely silent, everyone frozen. Take off the sweater. My dad stepped toward me. You don't get to demand anything. If everything's fine, she can show me, I said, holding my ground. Brandon's voice stayed eerily calm. You're being crazy. Sabrina turned to Brandon and signed something desperate, and he nodded, put his arm around her, and started moving her toward the door. I stepped in front of them, blocking their path. Sabrina, look at me. She did for just one second. And in that second, I saw pure terror in her eyes. Brandon pulled her Faster toward the exit. My dad's voice went hard and threatening. Move now! Not until Sabrina signs it herself, I said, refusing to budge. Not through Brandon. Brandon was clearly losing his patience. Now she did.

I looked her dead in the eye and said, the only thing getting transferred tomorrow is you to a psychic theatric ward. Everyone in the living room started clapping at my sister's announcement like this was normal. Mom pulled out a binder with medical documents and hospital schedules. We've already paid the clinic and signed all the contracts on your behalf, she said. Sliding the papers across the coffee table, I snatched them up and saw my signature on every single page, my handwriting, my signature. Except I've never seen these documents before in my entire life. I never agreed to any of this, I said. Standing up and backing toward the door. My sister just smiled and said, of course you did. We talked about it last month, remember? I absolutely did not remember because it never happened. My dad announced the appointment is tomorrow at 9 sharp. We'll all drive together as a family. I ran for the front door, but my brother was already blocking it. Come on, don't back out now, he said. Everyone in this room contributed money to pay for the procedure. My sister's husband moved to block the back door while mom stepped between me and the garage. They'd cornered me. The procedure was happening in less than 24 hours and my entire family was making sure I couldn't escape. I shoved past my brother and Made it to the hallway but my sister caught up and grabbed my shoulder. You're being so dramatic right now, she said. It's just nine months of your life and then I get to be a mom. I spun around and said you're completely insane if you think I'm going through with this. Dad pulled out his phone and showed me the bank transfers, $25,000 to the fertility clinic. We already paid everything up front and it's non refundable. He said. If you don't show up tomorrow, we lose all of the money. My sister started crying those fake tears she perfected since childhood. I can't have kids naturally and you're my only sister, my only hope. How can you be so selfish? Her husband put his arm around her and glared at me like I was the villain in the situation. My brother showed me text from our extended family, aunts and uncles and cousins all congratulating me on my sacrifice. Grandma had apparently donated $5,000 toward the medical costs. They'd told everyone. The entire family believed I'd volunteered for this. Mom grabbed both my hands and said we even picked out names already. If it's a girl, we're naming her after you. That's when I noticed the overnight bag by the door or with my clothes in it they packed for me. They expected me to stay here tonight so they could drive me to the appointment in the morning. My sister pulled out her phone and started Showing me photos of other surrogates. See how beautiful this is. You're going to love being pregnant. Some women say it's the best time of their lives. Dad moved closer and his voice dropped low. If you don't do this, you're.

Three years ago, my older sister Katie lost her 6 year old daughter Mia in a car crash. My brother in law was driving when someone ran a red light and hit them on the passenger side where Mia was sitting. She died instantly. He walked away with just some bruises and a broken arm. Our whole family was destroyed. I loved Mia so much, used to call me Uncle Benny and make me play dinosaurs with her for hours. The funeral was the worst day of my life. Katie couldn't even stand up during the service. But here's the thing, I was only 19 when it happened and about to start my second year of college. A few weeks after the funeral, I met this girl named Rachel in my psychology class. We started talking and she made me laugh for the first time since the accident. I felt guilty about it at first, like I wasn't allowed to be happy when my family was falling apart. But Rachel didn't know about Mia or the crash. She just knew me as this normal college guy. And being around her felt like I could breathe again. My family was stuck in this dark place. Every family dinner was silent. Every conversation somehow LED back to Mia. My mom cried constantly. Katie and her husband barely spoke to each other. It was like the whole family died. That day, not just Mia. So I started pulling back. I'd skip family dinners to hang out with Rachel. I'd make excuses not to come home on weekends. I know it sounds selfish, but I was drowning in everyone else's grief and I needed to survive. Rachel and I dated all through college. She knew about Mia eventually, but she never made me feel bad for wanting to move forward. Last week, I took her to this beach where we had our first real date three years ago. It was sunset and perfect and I got down on one knee and proposed. I said yes immediately. We were both crying and laughing. And I'd saved up for months to buy her this ring she'd been looking at. It wasn't expensive, but it was hers and she loved it. We Facetime my parents right there on the beach to tell them. My mom started crying happy tears. My dad was grinning like crazy. They both said.

I split a check, Richard. That's normal. Not in our family. When I was dating Linda, I always paid. That's what men do. And when you were dating Linda, a nice dinner probably cost 40 bucks. Your generation always has an excuse. My generation has $50,000 in student loan debt and rent that cost half our income. But sure, let's pretend it's the same economy. You bought your house in silence. If you can't afford to take care of my daughter properly, I take care of your daughter just fine. I'm not taking care of you. He hung up that night. Janet came over. My dad says you were disrespectful. Your dad thinks I'm an ATM. He thinks you should provide, provide for my girlfriend. I don't provide for her parents, who are more financially stable than I am. So you won't have dinner with my family anymore. I'll have dinner with your family, but I'm ordering water and a salad and I'm only paying for my own meal. You're being ridiculous. I'm being realistic. Your parents order like they're trying to hit A personal record and expect me to fund it. She stood up. Maybe we should take a break. Maybe we should. Two weeks later, she texted, can we talk? We met for coffee. I talked to my therapist. She asked me if my parents paid for their parents dinners every week. I said no. She asked why we expected that from you. I waited. I didn't have a good answer. I just thought, that's what you do. You take care of their family. There's a difference between taking care of someone and being taken advantage of. She nodded. I talked to my parents, told them we need to split checks. How'd that go? My dad said, if you can't afford to treat us, maybe you're not the right fit. And what do you think? I, I think my dad's used to getting his way and I've been letting him. Three months later, we went to dinner with her parents, a casual Italian place. When the Bill came, Richard reached for it. We'll split it, Janet said, four ways. Her dad looked at her, then at me, then pulled out his card. We've been together two years now. We rotate who pays. Sometimes it's us, sometimes it's them. Last month, Richard ordered the expensive steak. When the Bill came, he paid for all of it. After dinner, he pulled me aside. I was wrong about you. I thought you were cheap. Turns out you just have a backbone.

And my grandpa asked me to make it again the next week. For the first time ever, I felt like I was actually good at something. I kept cooking for them a few times a week and it became my favorite thing to do. They'd sit at the table and tell me how good everything smelled while I was cooking. Then we'd eat together and talk about our day. It felt normal, like what families are supposed to be like. Eventually, my parents started pushing me to come home. They'd show up unannounced to check on me. The last few times they came over, they arrived right when I was making dinner. They'd watch me cook and then leave without saying much. Finally, they told me I had to come home or there would be consequences, not just for me, but for my grandparents, too. That felt like a threat. So I moved back home. For two weeks, everything was normal. Then one night my mom asked why I never cooked for them like I did for my grandparents. My dad jumped in saying I could save them hundreds of dollars a week on takeout if I just made dinner. I told them I didn't wanna cook four separate meals every night. None of my siblings eat the same things. My brother with special needs only eats like five foods total. My other siblings would complain no matter what I made. My parents said that's too bad. And I Should do chores without needing appreciation. I pointed out that they don't even cook. We literally eat take out every single night. Why was this suddenly my job? They went to the store and bought stuff for me to cook, chicken, potatoes, vegetables, basic stuff. When my siblings saw the groceries, they all said, Ew, gross, and refused to eat any of it. The food was still in the packages. They, I hadn't even tried it. I still refused to cook. My parents told me I was being a bad son and brother, that helping my family should make me feel good about myself and I was choosing to be selfish instead. The thing is, I wasn't being selfish with my grandparents. I wanted to cook for them because they appreciated it and treated me like I mattered.

My younger sister was constantly going out with her friends to drink, use substances, and go to strangers parties when she was only a teenager. She ended up getting pregnant at 18 by some guy she met at one of those parties. Our parents are really against abortion because they think it's a sin to unalive a clump of cells. So they forced my sister to carry the baby to term. She gave birth to the baby, and she did not want the child. She was adamant about putting it up for adoption, which my parents refused. I swear I heard her say she was going to leave the baby at a random doorstep because she wanted to get rid of the baby that badly. She didn't even want to pick up the child, would leave her sitting in her own filth, and wouldn't feed her. Despite never wanting children myself either, I. I stepped in and adopted my Newborn niece as my daughter. I thought I was doing the right thing because the baby would only grow up to be abused or neglected if my sister continued to raise her. My sister, of course, didn't stop me and was more than eager to give her baby away. But my boyfriend of three years gave me an ultimatum. When I told him about my decision, he didn't want children. Either. So he made me choose between him or her. It was a no brainer. And the fact I was a single mother hit me deeply. It was really tough being a single parent and barely being able to make ends meet. Finding a babysitter was hard. Managing my last year of college and working part time made me miserable. And waking up in the middle of the night to a screaming baby was not how I pictured my early 20s. But I persevered and things have been looking up for us. When my daughter was five, I told her that she was adopted and despite me considering her my daughter, she was technically my niece. This didn't mean that I loved her any less and I would always be her mom. She took the news really well and it never felt like anything was missing. Just a year later, my sister stopped her wild ways and wanted to have access to her. I allowed it, but stressed she would just be an aunt to her. It wasn't with any malicious intent. I just didn't think she deserved to be considered a mom when she didn't even want her in the first place. Even though she accepted it, it's clear she struggled with the concept and sometimes acted more like a mother, which I always squashed quickly. Now my daughter is eight and I've been offered a job in a different country. The hey is almost double my current salary. And the company is helping us find a home, putting my daughter in an international school and after school care. I would be a fool not to take the promotion. And I told my parents to celebrate the wonderful news, but they weren't happy with it at all. They had a meltdown about how I can't do this. It's cruel to take my daughter away from her family and it's not fair to my sister. My sister has told me she won't allow me to move away with her and that she'll fight in court to get my daughter back. I thought that was completely uncalled for because I had done all the hard parts. I had raised her properly and made sure she got the love she was entitled to. It was obvious that my sister only wanted her because now the hard part was over with and my daughter was a wonderful mannered little girl. I've talked to lawyers and it seems she doesn't have a leg to stand on as my daughter is legally my daughter. But the rest of my family is telling me I'm being extremely cruel. And if I cared about my sister, I'd turn this job down. I have sacrificed and suffered so much because

I laughed at her. Ask someone else. Your body hasn't rejected an organ in 15 years. Anyway, I went to hang up, but she quickly spoke. It's not for me, her voice cracked. It's for my son. He's 9. Please. I felt bad for maybe four seconds. Then I remembered who I was talking to. Lest I'm sorry about your kid, but no, I'm not doing that. She hung up. An hour later, someone knocked on my door. It was Celeste and my brother Lennox was with her. We need to talk, Lennox said, pushing past me into my apartment. Celeste followed crying. Lennox, what are you doing here, I asked. Helping someone who actually needs help, he shot back. They spent the next hour tag teaming me. Celeste crying about her dying son, Lennox calling me a heartless coward. Every time I asked why he was here, he diverted the subject to me being selfish. Finally, after a million knows, Celeste looked me dead in the eye and said, you're going to donate whether you like it or not. Over the next week, they kept ambushing me together. I'd be eating lunch and suddenly Lennox and Celeste would be there causing a riot in the restaurant and yelling that I was happy to kill a child, loud enough for everyone to judge me. Then Celeste took it further. She showed Up at my office while I was on a zoom call with the CEO with the kid beside her, a pale, thin 9 year old in a hospital mask. My boss was talking about a promotion when she walked him right up to my desk. This is the man who can save your life, she told the kid loud enough for everyone to hear. The kid looked at me with huge eyes, are you going to save me? My boss stopped speaking, staring at Celeste who had her phone out filming. I felt my face burning. Celeste, this isn't fair. What's not fair is letting a child die, she said. Still filming, she turned to the CEO. Your worker is choosing to let a child pass away. My boss hung up shortly and the rumor spread like wildfire. That night, Lennox showed up at my apartment with papers, legal documents. I talked to a lawyer, he said, spreading them on my kitchen counter. You can be sued for failure to render aid to a minor. You could face charges. I picked up the papers. They looked official, court letterhead, legal language, the whole thing. Just sign the consent form, Lennox said, or deal with this in court. I told him to get out. The next morning, I was researching these documents when Lennox texted me, good luck. Before I could even respond, my doorbell rang. I opened it and Celeste's entire family barged inside. Her mom, her dad, even her Grandmother in a wheelchair. They surrounded me in my own living room for five hours. They took turns. Her mom crying about losing her grandson, her dad yelling about family responsibility. The whole time, I kept thinking, how did Lennox know they were coming? Were they dating behind my back?

Call your mom right now. I looked up, confused because Mister Bax never talked to individual kids unless someone was throwing things or starting fights. He'd been driving Route 47 for like 10 years and barely acknowledged any of us existed. Why? I pulled out my earbuds and walked closer to the front. His knuckles were white from gripping the steering wheel so hard. Just call her right now. His voice had this urgent edge that made my stomach flip. Fumbled for my phone while other kids started complaining about why we weren't moving. We were stopped 3 blocks before my usual stop on Cedar Lane, just sitting there with the engine idling. My mom's phone went straight to voicemail. I tried again. Same thing. She's not answering. Mister Bax was staring at something in his side mirror, and when I turned to look, I saw a black sedan that had been following us for the last few turns. Try your dad or anyone else in your family. Now I was really freaking out because. But drivers don't care about your family unless something is seriously wrong. I called my dad and got voicemail again. The black car was still there, just sitting behind us with its engine running. Through the tinted windows, I could see the outline of someone in the driver's seat. Mr. Bax, what's going on? MY voice Came out higher than I meant it to. He reached for his radio and spoke quietly into it. Base, this is bus 47. I need immediate assistance at Cedar and fifth. Possible situation with suspicious vehicle following my route. The dispatcher's voice crackled back, asking for details, but Mr. Bax kept his responses vague. The other kids on the bus were getting restless and starting to ask questions. Jace from the back yelled, Yo, why aren't we moving? I got practice! Mr. Bax ignored him and kept watching that black car in his mirror. Kip, I need you to listen very carefully when I tell you. I want you to duck down below the window level and stay there until I say it's safe. My heart started pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears. Are we in danger? I whispered. But before he could answer answer! The black sedan pulled up alongside our bus. The windows were so dark I couldn't see inside, but I felt like someone was staring right at me. Mister Bax's hand moved to something under his dashboard that looked like a panic button. Everyone sit down and be quiet! He announced to the whole bus in his serious voice. The car kept pace with us as we started moving again. Staying right next to my window, I pressed myself against the seat back, trying to make myself smaller. Other kids were craning their necks to see what was happening, but something about The whole situation felt wrong in a way I couldn't explain. My phone finally rang, and it was my mom. But she sounded weird. Really weird. Tip, honey, where are you right now? Her voice was shaky, like she'd been crying. I'm on the bus.

I'm 16 and I had surgery earlier this year on my shoulder. The doctor said I needed to be really careful during recovery because if someone bumped into me wrong, I could mess up the whole surgery. My parents wanted me to recover at home, but that was never going to work. I have three younger siblings. Two of them have special needs and don't really understand personal space. My 9 year old brother will just run up and tackle you without warning. My 13 year old sister gets over stimulated and sometimes pushes people. Then there's my 10 year old brother who acts out constantly because my parents are always dealing with the other two. He'll throw things, slam doors, wake everyone up at 4:00am screaming about something random. It's chaos 24 7 at my house. My grandparents offered to let me stay with them during recovery and honestly, it saved my life. Their house was quiet. I could actually sleep through the night. Nobody was barging into my room or messing with my stuff. It felt like I could finally breathe. The doctor said I needed about two months to recover, but I stayed for three and a half months. I know I could have gone home earlier, but I didn't want to. At my grandparents house they actually talked to me. Like real conversations about my day, what I was thinking, About what I wanted to do after high school. At home, the only time my parents talked to me was to tell me to go pick up food for everyone or watch one of my siblings while they dealt with the other ones. After a few weeks with my grandparents, I started feeling better and asked if I could cook for them. I've been learning recipes in my home economics class at school, but only got to try them once in class. My grandparents said yes as long as I took it easy. I made them this chicken pasta dish for my first try, and they loved it. My grandma kept saying it was restaurant

So, yeah, nobody was a fan of these people at all. Then about a month after they moved in, they knocked on our door. My dad answered, and the husband was standing there with his wife. He goes, hey, so we were wondering if you could do us a favor. My dad just stared at him. The guy continues, those trees and bushes along your fence are blocking our view. Would you mind cutting them down? My dad blinked. You want us to cut down our trees? Yeah. We can't see anything from our back porch. It's all just branches. My dad goes, you live at the bottom of a hill. The only thing behind you is more hill and other houses. View are you talking about? The guy got annoyed. It doesn't matter. They're blocking our sightline, and we'd like them gone. My dad said, no, just flat out no. The wife jumped in, could you at least trim the branches down so we can see through them? Just thin them out a bit. My dad told them he'd think about it. Then they left. We had a family meeting that night. My mom was like, absolutely not. My brother suggested we do the opposite. So that's exactly what we did. We stopped trimming anything. The bushes along the fence started growing thicker. The tree branches spread out more. That little patch of wild grass and weeds. Next to our patio that we usually kept neat, we let it go completely. It grew up tall and bushy and filled in all the gaps. Within two months, their entire view from the back porch was just solid green. Leaves, branches, bushes, all of it. They couldn't see through any of it. My dad was sitting on our back deck one evening and heard the husband yelling at his wife about those idiots next door. We just laughed. Best part? We were actually planning to build a privacy fence along that side of the yard. Anyway, it was going to cost like $2,000. Now we don't need it. The trees and overgrowth do the job for free. We actually like it better this way because it looks more natural and we didn't have to spend the money. They haven't said anything to us since.

My wife Lisa, grew up in a horrible home. Her parents were awful to her, calling her names and hurting her for years. When we met at 19, she would tell me these stories that made me sick to my stomach. It took so much therapy for her to understand that what they did to her wasn't okay, that she didn't deserve any of it. I was there through all of it, holding her while she cried, reminding her that she was nothing like what they told her she was. When we had our two kids, Mia, who's eight, and Ryan, who's six, we made this promise to each other. We would always put them first, no matter what. Their safety was everything. Three months ago, Lisa got a call from some hospice worker. Her parents were dying and wanted to see her. She went back and forth for weeks about whether to visit them. I told her I'd support whatever she decided, but that I understood if she never wanted to see them again. She ended up going a few times by herself. Each time, she came home looking exhausted and confused. After one visit, she told me they asked to meet the kids. She said she told them absolutely not. She even seemed proud of herself for setting that boundary. She said it felt weird that these people who treated her so Badly actually wanted to meet their grandchildren. I told her I was proud of her for saying no, that our kids didn't need that kind of negativity in their lives. Except she lied to me. Last Tuesday, Lisa told me she was taking the kids to the park after school. They were gone for three hours. When they got home, both kids went straight to their rooms without saying hi to me. That's when I knew something was wrong. Ryan came downstairs an hour later, crying. He told me the park was weird and that grandma and grandpa said mean things. My heart dropped. I asked him what he meant by grandma and grandpa. He said the ones who were in the beds at the hospital place. Lisa had taken them to the hospital to meet her parents. I pulled Mia aside and asked her what happened. She started crying immediately. She told me her grandfather said something really disturbing about how she looked. So something no eight year old should ever hear. Something that made my blood run cold. Then she said the worst part. Her mom just stood there and didn't leave, even when he kept saying gross things. Her mom made them stay. For almost two hours, they sat in that room while those monsters said horrible stuff to my babies. I confronted Lisa, and she immediately broke down crying. She was apologizing and trying to hug me, looking for comfort. I stepped back and told her To pack a bag and leave. the kids didn't need to be around someone who would do that to them. She kept crying and saying she made a mistake. That she thought maybe her parents had changed. She wanted to give them one last chance to be decent human beings. I told her that was her choice to make for herself, not for our children. We're separated now. I filed for divorce last week. I documented everything, talked to the police about what her father said to Mia. Got a lawyer. Lisa has only seen the kids. Why? Since then, and only with me present. Her friends have been calling me non stop. They say I'm throwing my wife away when she needs me most. That I'm making her out to be the villain when she's the real victim. They keep saying it was one

Five years later, they saw that same car parked in front of my company's headquarters with my logo on the building. I was 22 watching my dad hand my brother Kyle keys to a brand new BMW. Kyle was 19, just dropped out of his second college, but somehow he was getting rewarded again. This is to help you get back on your feet, dad said, clapping Kyle on the shoulder. You've got potential, son. I've driven there in my beat up Honda, bought myself working two jobs through college. I graduated with honors. Nobody threw me a party. I got a handshake and, well, that's what you're supposed to do. Congrats, Kyle, I said, trying to sound genuine. My brother smirked. Thanks, man. Maybe when you finally get a real job, Dad'll get you something, too. Dad laughed, actually laughed. Then he turned to me, serious. Kyle's right, Liam. When are you going to stop this startup nonsense and get a real career? You're wasting your degree. I'm building something, dad. Company is growing. You're 22 years old sleeping on a friend's couch eating ramen. You call that success? He shook his head. Face it, son. You're never going to amount to anything chasing these pipe dreams. Your brother understands reality. Maybe you should take notes. Those words hit different, not because they Were new. I'd heard variations my whole life, watching Kyle get handed a luxury car for failing while I got lectured for trying. It just broke something. You're right, I said quietly. I should stop wasting everyone's time. Mom looked relieved. Finally some sense. I stopped calling, stopped showing up to family dinners, stopped trying to explain my business plans to people who looked at me like I was delusional. I poured everything into my software company, sleeping four hours a night, coding until my eyes burned, pitching to investors who actually listened. The first year we barely survived. The second, we broke even. The third, we landed a major client. By year four, we'd gone from six employees to 60. By year five, we just secured Series B funding and moved into our new headquarters downtown. The same week we moved in, Kyle totaled the BMW. Dad's insurance wouldn't cover it because Kyle had 3D U S. Suddenly my phone started ringing again. Liam, it's dad. Listen, Kyle's in a tough spot. Needs a reliable car for job interviews. Think you could spot him a few grand? I didn't respond. Three days later, mom called. Your father's business is struggling. We might lose the house. As the successful son, we thought you could help us out. The successful son. Funny how that title transferred. When they needed something, come by this Sunday, mom pressed. I pulled up in my Tesla wearing a suit that cost more than my old Honda. The shock on their faces was immediate, but nothing compared to their expressions when Kyle pointed at the building across the street. Hey, isn't that your company's logo? He asked, confused. There it was. My company name in bold letters across the top of the headquarters, visible from their house. The building I'd leased specifically in this neighborhood because the rent made sense. Not realizing it. Face.

When I said I live in my car, he choked on his food. The silence that followed was deafening. Mom dropped her fork and it clattered against her plate. My younger brother stopped mid bite, staring at me like I just confessed to murder. Dad was coughing, reaching for his water glass. His fate, it's turning red. What do you mean you live in your car? Mom finally whispered. I've been dreading this moment for eight months. Every family dinner, every phone call, I've been carefully dodging questions about my living situation. When they asked about my place, I changed the subject to work. When they wondered about my neighborhood, I talked about the weather. dad had caught me off guard by mentioning rent costs in the city, assuming I was struggling like any normal 25 year old. The truth was more complicated than just being broke. I had a decent job at a tech startup king, $65,000 a year. My bank account wasn't empty. I could afford rent, could have gotten a studio apartment months ago. The problem was my credit score completely destroyed by identity theft. Two years earlier, someone had opened 17 credit cards in my name, maxed them all out, then disappeared, leaving me with $80,000 in debt I never created. Fighting identity theft is like trying to prove a negative. Every apartment application got rejected within hours. Landlords would smile during tours, call later saying they'd gone With someone else. Property management companies wouldn't even return my calls once they ran my credit check. I'd filled out 93 rental applications in four months, getting rejected by everyone from luxury high rises, basement apartments with no windows. My Honda became my bedroom by necessity, not choice. I'd invested in window tinting, a good sleeping bag and a gym membership for showers. I rotated between different parking spots, 24 hour Walmart's, quiet residential streets, hotel parking lots where I could blend in. I kept business clothes in my gym locker, maintained my professional appearance, never let my coworkers know I was sleeping in the company parking garage. The irony was crushing. I was making more money than I'd ever earned, finally building a career in software development, but living like I was homeless because of crimes someone else committed. I'd spent thousands on lawyers, credit repair services, identity Protection, money that could have gone toward deposits and rent. Every month I'd check my credit report, hoping for improvement, only to find new fraudulent accounts appearing. Dad was still coughing, processing what I'd said. But you have a job.

No, thanks. Enjoy the view of the leaves. So these new neighbors moved in next door about two months ago. The guy who lived there before was this quiet old dude who kept to himself and waved when you saw him. Super chill. Then he sold his place and within 24 hours of the new couple moving in, literally everyone on the street hated them. First thing they did was park this massive boat trailer right in the middle of the road, not off to the side, not in one of their two driveways, just smack in the center where people drive. My dad went over and told them it was a safety issue and they needed to move it. The guy just shrugged and said he'd get to it later. It sat there for three days. Then their dog started barking. This wasn't normal dog barking. This thing barked at the wind, at cars, at nothing. They left it outside all night, every single night for like a month straight. I'm talking 2:00am, 4:00am, constantly. The whole neighborhood could hear it. Nobody was sleeping. But wait, there's more. They had a second dog that they let run loose in the mornings. This dog would sprint into everyone's yards and just take massive dumps on their front lawns. My mom watched it happen on our grass twice in one week. When she mentioned it to the wife, the lady literally said, oh, Yeah, he likes to explore and walked away, didn't pick it up, didn't apologize, nothing. The dog also started chasing people, like full on sprinting after them while they were trying to walk to their cars or check their mail. Missus Peterson from three houses down is in her 70s and this thing nearly knocked her over. So, yeah, nobody was a fan of these people at all.

I brought a carrot cake. Cole strolled in late with no dessert, just a story. Everyone laughed. Dad refilled his wine, glanced at me. You'll never be as good as your brother, he chuckled. Mom chuckled too. Cole laughed loudest. I put my fork down in my head. I counted 11 months covering their electric when Dad's hours got cut, 31 gas fill UPS, 22 transfers labeled groceries. Then Aunt Rita said to Cole, you really are the man of the family. Dad added, he's the one we can rely on. That word hit hard. I cleared plates.

Groceries. My phone buzzed. Mom, we love you. Bring paper towels next time. No thank you. Just a list. That night I opened my banking app. The money started when I was 21. Dad called after a snowstorm. Can you spot us? $120. I'll pay you back Friday. He never paid me back. By 24, it was routine. Every month, $300. Utilities, $80. Gas, $3 to $100. Groceries, roughly $650 a month for almost four years. Car tires, $480. Water heater, $250. That became $500. Coal's, emergencies, exams and slow months. I tried setting boundaries. Mom's side, we'll die before we ask again. That lasted two weeks. I added it all, $28,940. Before I stopped. I took a day off and listed every transfer. Nine pages. I put, put them in a binder. Sunday came. I carried a grocery bag. Mom was at the table with a calculator. Cole leaned on the counter. We've been doing the numbers, dad said. Everyone contributes monthly. I pulled out the binder. Before we talk about a plan, can we talk about the last four years? What's that? Mom asked. Receipts, money I've sent for utilities, groceries, repairs. Dad's mouth tightened. This is not the time. It's exactly the time. Mom flipped pages and frowned. What money? We never received a single dollar from you. The room went quiet. I slid my phone across. Open my bank app. The transfers Are there? Dad pushed it back. This is disrespectful. What's disrespectful is rewriting my life.

I'd heard variations my whole life, but watching Kyle get handed a luxury car for failing while I got lectured for trying, it just broke something. You're right, I said quietly. I should stop wasting everyone's time. Mom looked relieved. Finally, some sense. I stopped calling, stopped showing up to family dinners, stopped trying to explain my business plans to people who looked at me like I was delusional. I poured everything into my software company, sleeping four hours a night, coding until my eyes burned, pitching to investors who actually listened. The first year, we barely survived. The second, we broke even. The third, we landed a major client. By year four, we'd gone from six employees to 60. By year five, we just secured Series B funding and moved into our new headquarters downtown. The same week we moved in, Kyle totaled the BMW. Dad's insurance wouldn't cover it because Kyle had 3 d, U, I s. Suddenly my phone started ringing again. Liam, it's dad. Listen, Kyle's in a tough spot. Needs a reliable car for job interviews. Think you could spot him a few grand? I didn't respond. Three days later, mom called. Your father's business is struggling.

Rachel called her parents, too, and everyone was just so happy. Then the next morning, my phone rang at, like, 7 in the morning. It was Katie, and she was screaming at me before I even said hello. She's yelling about how I proposed on the anniversary month of Mia's death. How could I be so selfish and move on like Mia never existed? I was confused because it wasn't the anniversary. That's in March. This was October. But Katie wasn't listening. She kept screaming that I met Rachel right after Mia died, and that I clearly never cared about my niece. That I was too busy starting my perfect little life to be there for my family. I tried to calm her down and apologize for upsetting her. I told her I would always love Mia and think about her. But then Katie said something that made me snap. the whole family had been talking about how I abandoned them after Mia died. How I was too immature to handle real tragedy. How I chose some random girl over my own sister who needed me, and I just lost it. I told her it's been three years. Three years of watching everyone be miserable. I said I'm sorry Mia died, but life had to keep going, and I couldn't put my entire future on hold forever. She went silent for a second and then started crying. She called Me? Horrible. Said I was a selfish brother who never deserved to be Mia's uncle. Then she hung up on me. I tried texting her to explain better, but she blocked me on everything. I called my brother in law, and he just sighed and said, Katie doesn't want to see me right now. Maybe not ever. My parents are stuck in the middle. My mom keeps saying Katie needs more time. My dad told me privately that he understands, but that I need to be patient with my sister. Rachel feels terrible, like she caused this whole thing. But she didn't. I'm the one who told Katie the truth. That grieving for a week and grieving for 10 years doesn't bring anyone back. And that holding onto that pain forever only creates more pain. Now half my family won't talk to me. Two weeks before my wedding.

My mom has three kids from her first marriage before she had me with my dad. Her first husband died when I was born, so my half siblings are way older than me. My oldest brother is 31, my sisters are 29 and 27, and I just turned sixteen in last month. Growing up, they never treated me like family. They wouldn't call me their sister or even their half sister. Whenever someone asked, they'd say Mom's daughter or they'd completely ignore that I existed. Like at family gatherings, they tell people their parents only had three kids. My dad got it even worse. They never called him stepdad or anything respectful. I've heard them call him Mom's bed warmer more than once. Or they'd say he's her temporary dick until she can be with their real dad again. My mom would just laugh it off, like with some dark joke, instead of completely disrespectful. Their weddings were the absolute worst. Me and dad got pushed aside for everything. During the toasts, they'd mention each other, mom, and their dead father, but never acknowledged us once. We were basically ghosts standing in the corner. The photos were even more insulting. We're only in one big group wedding photo from each wedding. Just one. And I found copies later where they'd edited us completely out. They even used A I. To Put their dead dad in the spot where my dad was standing. Like they literally erased us. Replace dad with a dead man. But they still show up once a month for family dinner. Every single month, like clockwork. And the whole time, they ignore me and dad completely. They get their kids to ignore us, too. Last month was when I finally had enough. We were all sitting around the table eating mom's pot roast. My oldest nephew was telling some story about school. Mom was trying to include me in the conversation. So she said, your aunt Amy went through something similar in her class. My half brother cut her off immediately. Don't call her that. She's not their aunt. His voice was so cold, it made everyone stop eating. Mom looked confused and said, what do you mean? Of course she is. Then my sisters jumped in. They both said the same thing. Basically, I wasn't their kids aunt, just like dad wasn't their kids Grandpa. They said he was just some guy mom was married to for now. My half brother actually said those exact words. He's just the guy you're married to for now. He pointed at my dad when he said it. My dad just sat there staring at his plate, not saying anything. I looked at mom, expecting her to defend us, but she just went quiet and changed the subject like it never happened. That's when I stood up and said, I Was done with these dinners. My mom started saying I shouldn't leave, that we barely see each other as it is. I just laughed. We barely see each other? They've made it clear for 16 years that they don't see me at all. They pretend I don't exist, except for these dinners, where they can ignore me to my face. My half sister rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic. So I asked her straight up, am I your sister? She looked away and said, it's complicated. I asked my brothers the same thing. Neither of them would answer. Then I asked if dad was their stepdad. My oldest brother finally said, no, he's not.

I said take all the closure you need. Then I called her dad. Been with Jenna for 3 years, engaged for 6 months. Wedding plan for next spring. Last Tuesday we're having dinner when she drops it. Marcus, I need to tell you something. Trevor reached out last week, her ex musician, who treated her like garbage for two years. We've been talking. I realized I never got proper closure with him. There's still unresolved feelings. Unresolved feelings. Not love. I love you, but I need to close that chapter properly before we start our life together. How exactly do you close this chapter? She looked at her plate. I need to see him one more time, one night just to get it out of my system. You're asking permission to sleep with your ex. It's about closure. The physical part is just part of that process. I stared at her 3 years, ring on her finger, wedding venue booked and she's asking to bang her ex for closure. You know what, Jenna? Take all the closure you need. Her face lit up. Really? You understand? Absolutely. Go right ahead. She launched herself at me, covering my face with kisses. You're amazing. So mature. It's just one night and then we'll be stronger than ever. When were you planning this? Saturday. He has a show Friday night. Perfect. Text me the address. Why? Just want To know where you are for safety. She practically skipped to bed. I waited until she was asleep, then found Trevor's address in their text chain. Lots of can't wait to see you with heart emojis. Then I called her Dad. Richard's a Marine veteran, owns a construction company. Conservative as hell. We get along great. He's already calling me son Marcus. It's late. Everything okay? Hey, Richard, quick question. Jenna mentioned helping her friend Sarah move Saturday. Did she? Are you guys pause. She told her mother she's having a spa weekend. I don't want to get in the middle of this, but she's planning to visit Trevor on Saturday. The silence was deafening. Trevor. Her ex, Trevor. Richard had threatened to rearrange Trevor's face when they broke up. Yeah. She says she needs closure. What's the address? I get? Give it to him. We hung up. Saturday came. Jenna spent two hours getting ready. New lingerie. I saw the tags in the trash. Fresh manicure, the works. I'll be back tomorrow morning. Thank you for being so understanding. Take your time. Get all the closure you need. She left at six PM at 6:45, Richard texted, I'm here. At 7:23, my phone exploded. Jenna calling. I let it ring. Texts, putting in, what did you do? My dad is here. This is crazy. How could you. At 8:15, Richard called. She's in my truck. We're having a conversation about honesty and respect. Is she okay? She's fine. Embarrassed. Trevor nearly wet himself.

Second, did she tell you she went through my phone and refused to hand hers over because she was hiding text with her ex? Her mom, she deserves privacy. Women don't cheat like men do. I laughed so loud she hung up. By Saturday, Natalie shows up with Britney and two random dudes for muscle. Like I'm about to fight her over throw pillows. I already boxed her stuff. Bubble wrapped her succulents organized, labeled. She starts digging. Where's my grandmother's ring? In the jewelry box. Blue pouch. She found it. Look disappointed. And she tries, what about my half of the deposit? You didn't pay a dime, not even on the lease. Her little bodyguard goes, that's illegal, bro. So I pulled up receipts, texts from when she begged not to be added to the lease. Even Britney laughed. Then Natalie tries her last move. I'll show you the text if you take me back. Wait. Text you swore were permanently deleted. You magically have them now. She pulls out her phone. She had screenshots. So she lied again. I saw enough. Jake telling her he missed her. Her saying she thought about him. Him asking if she was happy with me. Her saying it's complicated. Coffee dates. She told me were work meetings, flirty selfies. She swore it wasn't physical. Doesn't matter. That's cheating. Even her hired muscle shook his head, yo, that's messed up. Turns out she paid them $50 each to look intimidating. I laughed so hard I almost thanked her for the comedy show. Even Brittany shook her head. Nat, you played yourself. And the karma. Jake ghosted her, didn't even want her when she was single, told her she only wanted him as a backup plan. Now she's texting me at 2:00am. I messed up. I was projecting. I love you. Nah, you loved rent money. You love texting your ex while I paid for everything. That's not love. Her new man, she pulled the same stunt, tried to check his phone. After 3 weeks, he dumped her instantly. Pattern behavior. So, yeah, she demanded to search my phone while hiding an emotional affair with her ex. Tried to gaslight me. Brought hired muscle to move out, lied about deleting texts and ended up alone. And me, I've got peace, me, my dog and receipts.

I started ordering water and splitting my entree with their daughter. The Bill came on a Tuesday night at Romano's. Three hundred and eighty seven dollars for four people. Janet's father, Richard, slid it across the table and looked at me expectantly. This was the eighth dinner in three months. I paid for all seven before this. I looked at the Bill. Richard had ordered the 48 ounce porterhouse for two 14, $40. Janet's mom, Linda got the lobster tail, $65. Appetizers, three bottles of wine. I didn't drink dessert for everyone but me. Richard cleared his throat. I picked up the Bill, read through it slowly, set it back down in the middle of the table. Let's split this. My half is 96 point 75 cents. The table went silent. Janet's eyes went wide. What? I'm suggesting we split the check. I'll cover mine and Janet's portion. Richard's face hardened. That's not how we do things. It's how I'm doing things tonight. Linda touched her napkin to her lips. Well, this is awkward. I pulled out my wallet, counted out five 20s and a 10. That's $110 covers my share plus tip. Richard didn't move. Neither did Linda. Janet stared at her plate. Richard's jaw tightened. He pulled out his credit card, slapped it on top of my cash. The drive home Was silent for 10 minutes. Then Janet spoke. What the hell was that? That was me not paying $400 for dinner again. My parents always expect the man to pay. It's respectful man, or specifically me. You know what I mean? Does your dad pay when you go out with his parents? That's different. How? They're older and you make good money. Dad's retired. Your dad retired at 55 with a full pension and owns three rental properties. I'm 29 and still paying student loans. She crossed her arms. So you're keeping score now I'm noticing a pattern. Every time we have dinner with your parents, expected to cover everyone, your dad orders the most expensive thing on the menu and I'm supposed to smile and pay because I make a decent salary. They raised me. The least you can do is buy them dinner. I've bought them dinner eight times in three months. That's over two grand. She didn't answer. The next week, her mom texted me. Richard made reservations at the Capital Grill for Saturday. Seven PM I showed Janet. I'm not going. You have to go. It's already planned. I'm.

It's from the professor, sent to the whole group by accident, clearly meant just for my three friends. Subject line, re concerns about team member. I open it and my blood runs cold. There's a whole email chain. My friends have been meeting with the professor for weeks, building a case that I was the problem teammate. Screenshots of me micromanaging in the group chat claims I refused to let them contribute. One of them even wrote, he just wants all the credit for himself because he's obsessed with his GPA. Been trying to work around him, but he won't let us access the files. But here's the part that makes my hands shake. Attached to the latest email is a separate presentation. Their own version, 20 slides of mediocre work, but it exists. They've been working together this whole time just without me. The professor's response, I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. Let's discuss alternatives for your grade separate from his. Why would they do this? We've been friends for three years. I scroll back through the chain and find it, an email from week one. If we tank his participation grade and do our own project, we can Still pass and he'll be the one who fails. Then maybe he'll stop making the rest of us look bad in every class. Monday morning, I walked into that classroom with two USB drives. One had my complete project. The other had screenshots of every ignored message, every email, and their entire scheme. When the professor called us up to present, I plugged in drive No. 2 first. I didn't say a word, just let it project on the screen while the whole class read their plan to sabotage me. My three friends went pale. Then I switched to my actual presentation and delivered 20 minutes of flawless analysis. The professor stopped me after and asked to speak privately. I handed him both drives and said, I'll take my zero on the group portion. It's worth it. Two days later, I got an email. I'd failed the group project as expected, dropped my final grade to a C. But attached was a letter of recommendation to Harvard's graduate program that started with, in my 20 years of teaching, I have never witnessed a student handle betrayal and adversity with such integrity and capability.

I said. You think I'm poisoning you? After eight years, you'd believe a stranger. I called Missus Vance immediately. She answered on the third ring, her elderly voice cheerful. Hello, dear. Did you ask Petra to buy rat poison for you last week? There was a long pause. Poison? No, dear. Why would I need that? I don't have any rats. Thank you, I said quietly and hung up. I showed Petra our credit card statement last Tuesday, $18 at Bergman's Hardware. The day Darius 1st saw the poison. She'd bought it, kept it, had it on our counter twice. That night, I didn't eat anything. Petra cooked. I ordered pizza from somewhere else. Petra cried in our bedroom. I ate alone. I called Darius, asked if he'd talk to police. He agreed, but I hesitated. What was my evidence? A box and a driver's word. No proof of anything actually in the food, just suspicion and Petra's lie. I moved to the guest room. Petra stopped cook. We ordered takeout for every meal and I opened every container in front of her. She watched with dead eyes. A week later, I found her medical records on her laptop left open on the coffee table. Maybe accidentally, maybe Not. There were bills from Doctor Kensington, a psychiatrist I'd never heard her mention. Notes about medication adjustments for severe depression, references to a miscarriage I didn't know she'd had the dates lined up with two months ago when she'd seemed distant and sad, but told me it was just work stress. The notes mentioned intrusive thoughts about harming herself, not others, herself. I confronted her and she broke down. The poison was for me, she sobbed. I was going to take it and stop thinking about ending everything. I didn't want you to find me that way. I bought it and kept moving it, trying to work up courage, but I couldn't do it. I couldn't leave you. So it sat there and I felt worse for being too cowardly to use it or throw it away. Darius saw it because I'd taken it out that morning thinking maybe today I would do it. But then you were happy about Thai food. And I put it back on the counter and forgot. I held her while she cried. The delivery driver had been right to warn me someone was in danger from that poison. He'd just been wrong about who. We threw it away together. Petra started therapy twice a week.

The whole time, I kept thinking, how did Lennox know they were coming? Were they dating behind my back? Then Celeste made a gofundme. She used my full name and photo. The title was, help us convince him to save a dying child. She wrote this whole post about how I was a match, but refused to donate. It got shared 617 times in three days. My phone wouldn't stop. Friends asking what was happening, my mom calling, crying, asking if it was true. Celeste called me and said, I'll take down the gofundme. Just say yes. I blocked her number. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough. She showed up at my apartment at 3:30 in the morning, sobbing, shaking. She said the doctors gave her son weeks, be days. She said she was out of options. She begged me to at least get tested, just to see if I was a real match. And if I wasn't, she'd leave me alone. Forever. I was exhausted. Fine. I'll get tested. Then if I'm not a match, you leave me alone. Her whole face changed. She pulled out her phone and texted someone. Eight minutes later, Lennox knocked on my door. He had a testing kit in his hands. They both stood there as I did the cheek swab. Celeste took it and said results would come in four days. The results came back. I was a perfect match. But that made no sense. The odds of a non family member matching were 1 in 20,000. Celeste and Lennox showed up together that same day, celebrating, hugging. Lennox had his hand on her shoulder, rubbing her back. We can schedule the surgery next week, Celeste said, breathless. Oh my god, thank you, thank you. I didn't agree to anything I said. But you're a match, Lennox said, almost angry. You have to do it now. Why do you even care this much? I asked him directly. Why are you so involved in her kids life? They both went quiet. How long have you two been together? I asked. Celeste looked at the floor. Lennox pulled his hand away. Eight years, Lennox finally said. I stared at him. Is the kid yours? That's not your business, Celeste whispered. And why is donating a kidney to him my business? My voice was getting louder. Celeste started crying. Real crying, not the manipulative kind. Cause he's yours. Everything stopped. What? The boy, she said, shaking. He's Your son? I didn't tell you. Lennox and I started dating right after we broke up. He's been raising him as his own. I looked at Lennox, my brother, who had always known. You've been hiding my kid from me for nine years. I raised my hand to hit him. Full story on channel linked below.

My mom has three kids from her first marriage before she had me with my dad. Her first husband died when I was born, so my half siblings are way older than me. My oldest brother is 31, my sisters are 29 and 27, and I just turned sixteen in last month. Growing up, they never treated me like family. They wouldn't call me their sister or even their half sister. Whenever someone asked, they'd say Mom's daughter or they'd completely ignore that I existed. Like at family gatherings, they tell people their parents only had three kids. My dad got it even worse. They never called him stepdad or anything respectful. I've heard them call him Mom's bed warmer more than once. Or they'd say he's her temporary dick until she can be with their real dad again. My mom would just laugh it off, like with some dark joke, instead of completely disrespectful. Their weddings were the absolute worst. Me and dad got pushed aside for everything. During the toasts, they'd mention each other, mom, and their dead father, but never acknowledged us once. We were basically ghosts standing in the corner. The photos were even more insulting. We're only in one big group wedding photo from each wedding. Just one. And I found copies later where they'd edited us completely out. They even used A I. To Put their dead dad in the spot where my dad was standing. Like they literally erased us. Replace dad with a dead man. But they still show up once a month for family dinner. Every single month, like clockwork. And the whole time, they ignore me and dad completely. They get their kids to ignore us, too. Last month was when I finally had enough. We were all sitting around the table eating mom's pot roast. My oldest nephew was telling some story about school. Mom was trying to include me in the conversation. So she said, your aunt Amy went through something similar in her class. My half brother cut her off immediately. Don't call her that. She's not their aunt. His voice was so cold, it made everyone stop eating. Mom looked confused and said, what do you mean? Of course she is. Then my sisters jumped in. They both said the same thing. Basically, I wasn't their kids aunt, just like dad wasn't their kids Grandpa. They said he was just some guy mom was married to for now. My half brother actually said those exact words. He's just the guy you're married to for now. He pointed at my dad when he said it. My dad just sat there staring at his plate, not saying anything. I looked at mom, expecting her to defend us, but she just went quiet and changed the subject like it never happened. That's when I stood up and said, I Was done with these dinners. My mom started saying I shouldn't leave, that we barely see each other as it is. I just laughed. We barely see each other? They've made it clear for 16 years that they don't see me at all. They pretend I don't exist, except for these dinners where they can ignore me to my face. My half sister rolled her eyes and said I was being dramatic. So I asked her straight up, am I your sister? She looked away and said, it's complicated. I asked my brothers the same thing. Neither of them would answer. Then I asked if dad was their stepdad. My oldest brother finally said, no, he's not. I grabbed my plate and told mom I'd be eating in my room from now on whenever they visited. She tried to stop me, saying I was being unfair and that family is important. I told her to tell them that because they've been denying me as family my entire

Introduction to American Sign Language. He'd return it on a Tuesday, I'd reshelve it in the language learning section, and by Friday he'd check it out again. Never any late fees, always in pristine condition, like he'd barely opened it. My coworker Sarah joked that maybe he kept for getting everything he Learned, or that he was the slowest reader in history. But something about it felt intentional. I work the circulation desk at our small public library, so you start to recognize patterns. We've got the romance novel lady who comes in every Wednesday, the teenage kid who camps out in the graphic novel section after school. The elderly man who reads three newspapers cover to cover every morning. But this guy was different. Mid forties, worn work boots, always came in during his lunch break, still wearing a navy blue uniform shirt with a name patch. Scan his card, take the same book, and leave without browsing anything else. After the third month, I started paying more attention. He had this careful way of handling the book, like it mattered more than just casual interest. Sometimes I'd see sticky notes poking out from the pages when he returned it. Little markers throughout. Once I flipped through it after he left and found pencil marks in the margins, hand positions, sketch next to certain signs. He was actually studying it. One Saturday morning, everything clicked into place. I was restocking the children's section when I spotted him at one of the small tables near the picture books. He wasn't alone. There was a little girl sitting across from him, maybe 7 or 8 years old, with dark braids and a purple backpack. They were completely silent, but his hands were moving slowly and deliberately, forming shapes in the air. She watched him with intense focus, and her small hands mimicked his movements. He smiled and nodded, then signed something else back and forth. This quiet conversation happening in the middle of our noisy Saturday crowd. I recognized her immediately. The foster care center is right across the street from our library, and I'd seen her walking past with groups of other kids before, for she always trailed behind, never quite part of the group. The man noticed me staring, and his face flushed. He stood up and walked over to the desk, looking embarrassed, like he'd been caught doing something wrong. I quickly told him it was fine, that I was just surprised. That's when he explained everything. He was a bus driver for the school district, had been for almost 15 years. Six. Six months ago, this little girl got assigned to his route. She was the only deaf student on a bus full of hearing kids, and the district didn't provide an aide or interpreter for the 40 minute ride. Each morning and afternoon she'd sit in the front Seat right behind him, staring out the window while chaos erupted.

Twice. So I let go completely. Two years later, I walked into that house party with a crowd that left her absolutely stunned. Regina ended it twice. First time, at her apartment after dinner. I need space. You're always here, always texting, always needing to know where I am. Second time, when I tried to fix things a month later. You're too clingy. You have no life outside of us. That word destroyed me. Clingy. Like loving someone completely was a character flaw. Three days later, she was already posting stories with hunter, one of our mutual friends from the group. The same hunter who'd been at every game night, every birthday, every random Tuesday hangout. They weren't even subtle about it. Same coffee shop we used to go to, same booth, same drinks. Except now hunter was sitting where I used to be. Our entire friend group just rolled with it. Hunter and Regina just clicked. They'd say like I'd never existed. Like three years of being part of their circle meant nothing. Lorelai, who I helped move twice, suddenly couldn't text back. Graham, who'd crashed at my place countless times, acted like we'd never met. They chose sides without anyone asking them to. I was completely alone. No girlfriend, no friends, no weekend plans, no one to text stupid memes to. So I did the only thing I could. Started saying yes to everything. Coworker mentioned. A hiking group. Yes. Random gym. Buddy invited me to trivia night. Yes! Neighbour needed someone for their recreational basketball team. Absolutely yes. The hiking group LED to Anna, Declan, and Carlos, three people who actually wanted to hang out. Trivia night introduced me to an entire crew of movie nerds who did weekly screenings. Basketball connected me to guys who grabbed beers without making it feel like an obligation. Within six months, I had three different group chats going, multiple invites every weekend. Inside jokes with people who didn't know Regina existed. They knew me as the guy who was always down for whatever, not the clingy ex who got dumped while I was building an actual life. Regina and hunter were imploding. According to Instagram, their posts went from constant to sporadic couple photos replaced with solo shots. Hunter's friends would occasionally mention drama when I ran into them. She's jealous of everyone. Can't handle him having other friends. Sound familiar? A year and a half in, I met Zoe at a concert my new friends dragged me to. She was there with her roommates, dancing like nobody was watching. We talked between sets about the most random things. She collected vintage postcards, had opinions about every food truck in the city, made me laugh until my sides hurt. When she asked for my number, she said it was because I seemed like someone with good friend group energy. Four months of dating before the universe decided to be hilarious. Her roommate Rachel was Dating someone named Graham? Yeah, that Graham. My former friend who'd ghosted me when Regina chose hunter. When Zoe mentioned meeting Rachel's boyfriend's friends at a house party, I knew exactly what was coming. The party was at Lorelai's new place.

Like when I joined Drama Club and got a small part in the spring play, she auditioned for the fall show and somehow landed the lead. Everyone kept saying how talented the Harris sisters were, but really they meant how talented Emma was at copying me and making it look effortless. Last month I finally hit my breaking point. I've been growing my hair out for two years and it was finally getting to that perfect length where it looked really good in pictures. Then Emma announced she was growing hers out too. She kept asking me about hair masks and what products I used, and I could see exactly where this was heading, so I came up with a plan. I told her I was thinking about getting a really dramatic haircut, like a pixie cut, because long hair was getting boring and hard to manage. I even looked up pictures on my phone and showed her, saying how cute and edgy it would look. He seemed interested but didn't say much. Then I started dropping hints about this amazing salon downtown that supposedly specialized in shortcuts. I made up this whole story about how my friend's cousin went there and looked like a completely different person afterward. Even created a fake Instagram post on my close friend's story showing some random pixie cut photo I found online, captioning it thinking about this Vibe Emma took the bait completely. She kept asking me when I was going to book the appointment and said maybe we could go together. I told her I was still thinking about it, but that I heard you had to book weeks in advance because the stylist was so popular. Two days later, she comes home with the shortest haircut I've ever seen on her. Not even a cute pixie cut, but like an actual boy's haircut where you could see her scalp in some spots. Apparently she'd gone to some cheap place in the mall and just told them to cut it all off because she wanted to beat her sister to the punch. She looked absolutely horrible. The cut was uneven, way too short, and completely wrong for her face shape. She. I was clearly trying to act confident about it, posting selfies and talking about how freeing it felt, but I could tell she was panicking inside. The best part was when my mom came home and literally gasped when she saw Emma. She kept asking what happened and if this was some kind of breakdown. Emma had to explain that she just wanted to change, but even she couldn't hide how awful it looked. I acted all supportive and told her it looked great, while secretly being thrilled that for once she jumped ahead of me and totally

There he is, the dad said, pointing at me. His voice was cold and angry. One of the officers stepped forward. Are you Paulo? Yeah. What's going on? We need to talk to you about some serious allegations, the officer said, regarding inappropriate contact with a minor. My heart started pounding. What? What are you talking about? The dad's face scowled and went fully red. You know exactly what this is about, my daughter. You picked her up from school today without my permission. I was just giving her a ride home. My girlfriend asked me to. Let's take this inside, the second officer said, gesturing to my door. My hands shook as I unlocked it. This couldn't be happening. Inside, the lead officer pulled out a notepad. We have a statement from the victim claiming you've been texting her privately inappropriate messages. Victim? No, that's not. But the dad shoved his phone in my face. Screenshots, messages that looked flirtatious. When will you be alone? One of them read. Can't wait to see you. Those aren't from me. I don't even have her number. I fumbled for my phone trying to call My girlfriend, she'd explain everything. The phone rang and rang and rang. She's always glued to her phone. Unless I need her, she's not answering. The second officer observed writing something down. Because she's probably disgusted the add spat. She probably can't believe her boyfriend is a predator. I'm not. Please, you have to believe me. The lead officer cut me off. We pulled security footage from the high school shows you sitting in your car outside the building at 3:15 p. M. Waiting. Yes, because my girlfriend asked me to pick her up. Son. If that were true, why wouldn't you call the parents first? The officer's tone was skeptical, professional, like he'd heard every excuse before. The dad's voice cracked. My daughter has been acting strange for weeks, secretive, staying out late. Now I know why. His hands balled into fists. You've been grooming her. No, I swear I was just. But right then my roommate's door opened. He stepped out, confused by the commotion. Do you know.

Someone's been living in my attic. Food keeps disappearing from my kitchen. I hear footsteps at night. Things get moved around. One of you has been staying up there? My mother frowned. Erica, Honey, none of us have been to your house in weeks. Someone has, Erica insisted. Found blankets up there this morning, empty water bottles, granola bar wrappers. Someone's been living in my house. That's creepy, Isaac said, no longer laughing. You sure it's not Victor sleepwalking or something? Victor's been with me every night, Erica said. And Colby's been at basketball camp half the month. It's someone else. Someone with a key. My father pushed his plate away. Erica, if someone's really been in your house, you need to call the police. Not calling the police on my own family, Erica said. Just tell me. Maybe someone needed space. Maybe there's problems at home I don't know about. I won't be mad. Erica, this is ridiculous, I said. Why would any of us secretly live in your attic? She pulled out her phone. Look at this. She showed us a photo of her attic corner with blankets arranged like a bed, water bottles lined up against The wall. A pile of what looked like clothes. Isaac leaned over to see. Okay, that's definitely weird, but it's not us. Then who is it? Erica's voice was getting higher. Who else has access to my house? My mother stood up. We're going over there right now. All of us. We all drove to Erica's place. Victor met us at the door, looking stressed. Thank god you're here. Erica's been freaking out all day. Where's Colby? Erica asked. Living room, Victor said, on his Xbox. We walked in to find Colby wearing headphones and deeply focused on his game. Erica yanked the attic ladder down in the hallway. Isaac, you go up first. Isaac climbed up. We could hear him moving around. Jesus called down. Someone's definitely been staying here. I climbed up after him. The attic looked like a makeshift bedroom. Sleeping bag in the corner, a battery powered lantern. Stack of books that look like they came from downstairs. Even a phone charger plugged into the single outlet. This is insane, I said. Victor climbed up behind us. How did we not notice this? They were careful, Isaac said, pointing to the setup. Everything's in the corner where you wouldn't see it unless you came all the way up. We climbed back down. Erica was pacing. I'm calling the police, mom. Colby had taken off his headphones and was standing in the hallway. His face was red. Not now, Colby, Erica said.

But the surprise wasn't ours. Look, I thought I was being the perfect husband. My wife Emma had been in Seattle for almost a week on some consulting gig, and our kids were missing her like crazy. Lucas, 13, was moping around the house, and Lily, nine, kept asking when Mommy was coming home. So I got this brilliant idea. Why not fly out and surprise her? I booked three tickets that same day, got the kids excused from school, called in a favor at work. The whole time, I'm picturing Emma's face when she opens that hotel door. I hadn't done something spontaneous like this in forever. I was feeling pretty proud of myself, honestly. Here's where things got weird, though. I tried calling Emma that morning to hear her voice, but it went straight to voicemail. I texted her, too. Nothing. By evening, still no response. I figured she was just slammed with meetings. Seattle was hosting some huge conference. No big deal, right? Wrong. On the flight, I tried calling three more times. Voicemail every single time. Not even a ring. That knot in my stomach that started the night before, it was getting tighter. Lucas noticed me checking my phone constantly and called me out on it. I played it cool, but honestly, something felt off. Emma always made time for the kids, even during her busiest Trips. We landed Thursday night around 8 p m. Rental car nightmare, traffic, hungry kids, you know the drill. The whole time, I'm thinking, maybe Emma can join us for a late dinner once we get to the hotel. I tried calling again as we pulled up to the Hilton. This time it actually rang, but she didn't answer.

I said yes, but that feeling in my gut was screaming at me. Now. At the front desk, I asked them to call Emma's room. No answer. The receptionist tried twice. Then she said some

I started showing up late to work, not by a lot, but enough that my boss, Todd, pulled me aside one day and asked if everything was okay. That's when I knew I had to say something because Todd's pretty chill and if he's noticing, then it's bad. So I talked to Tiana about it. I was nice about it too. I said, hey, I really need you to be ready when I get there because I can't keep being late. She apologized and promised she'd do better. Spoiler alert, she didn't. The very next week, same thing. I'm sitting in her driveway for 15 minutes while she's supposedly looking for her keys or fixing her hair or whatever excuse she had that day. I texted her again, like, hey, this is still happening. And she said she was really sorry and it wouldn't happen again. Last Friday, I decided this was it. I texted her the night before and said, look, I'm only waiting 5 minutes tomorrow because I literally cannot risk my job over this. He said, okay, no problem. I'll be ready. Friday morning, I pulled up at 7:15, like always, sent her the text that I'm here. She responds with one second. I'm watching the time on my dashboard. Five minutes pass. I call her. No answer. I wait another Minute because I'm not a complete jerk all again, nothing. So I left. I drove to work. And honestly, I felt bad, but also I'd warned her multiple times and given her a clear deadline that morning. I wasn't trying to be mean. I was trying to keep my job. About 15 minutes later, my phone just explodes. Text after text after text from Tiana. She's saying I abandoned her and she had to walk to work in 90 degree heat and she missed the first hour of her shift and her manager wrote her up. She's calling me a terrible friend and saying I should have just waited a few more minutes. I texted back that I was sorry, but I told her exactly what would happen if she wasn't ready. I couldn't keep doing this. She said that's not what friends do and real friends wait for each other no matter what. She completely stopped talking to me after that, won't respond to any texts.

My childhood best friend, Tony, moved to another country a few years ago, but his dad still owns this restaurant in our hometown. The place does really good Italian food, nothing fancy, but the portions are huge and everything tastes amazing. Tony's dad has known me since I was like 8 years old. Our families used to have barbecues together every summer and his parents would come to all my birthday parties. So whenever I go to his restaurant, he always tries to give me free food. I'm talking full meals, appetizers, dessert, the whole thing. The problem is, I know he's trying to retire soon. Tony told me his dad's been working at that restaurant for 30 years and he's finally saving enough to sell it and move to Florida. Every time he gives me free food, I feel guilty because that's money he could be putting toward his retirement. Last Friday, I went there with three of my friends from work, Alex, Mike and this girl, Sarah. It was Alex's idea because he'd heard me talking about the food before. The place was packed when we got there around seven PM, which is pretty normal for a Friday night. I figured Tony's dad wouldn't even be there because he usually lets his staff handle the dinner rush. Perfect. We could just eat, pay and leave without any awkwardness. We ordered a bunch of Stuff to share, pizza, pasta, these amazing garlic rolls they make. The Bill came out to like 120 bucks, so we each threw in 30 and left it on the table. As we're walking toward the door, I see him. Tony's dad is standing by the host stand talking to one of the servers. I tried to keep my head down and just slip past him, but he looked up right as I was walking by. His whole face lit up and he came over and gave me this big hug. He was asking how I'd been, how my mom was doing, the usual stuff. Then he noticed my friend standing behind me. That's when he said it. He got this disappointed look on his face and told me he was upset I didn't let him know I was bringing friends. He said if he'd known, he never would have made us pay for our food. I felt so awkward. I thanked him and said it was really nice of him to offer, but we'd already paid. He looked genuinely sad about it, like somehow failed at being a good host. I made some small talk for another minute and then we left. We're walking back to my car and Alex is quiet, not his usual self at all. Then he just explodes. What the hell, dude? Why did you make us pay when you could have gotten it for free? I tried explaining that Tony's dad is trying to Retire. And I didn't want to take advantage of him. But Alex wasn't having it. He said it wasn't my business to worry about some restaurant owners retirement fund that by making us pay, I basically stole 30 bucks from each of them. I told him that was ridiculous. We went to a restaurant and paid for our food like normal people. But Alex kept going. He said I had no right to make that decision for everyone, that if there was a chance to eat for free, I should have at least told them so they could decide. Mike and Sarah were just standing there looking uncomfortable, not saying anything. The ride home was so tense. Alex sat in the back seat muttering about how 30 bucks was 30 bucks and he could have used that money for other stuff. I dropped everyone off and nobody said thank you or bye or anything. Next Monday at work, Alex is still mad at me. He's been telling other people in the office about what happened, making it sound like I deliberately screwed everyone over. Now there's this whole group of people.

So my son Finn is in 3rd grade and his teacher sent out an email asking if parents wanted to volunteer snacks throughout the year. Lunch got pushed back to like 1 p. M. This year so the kids were getting hungry. It was totally voluntary and the only rule was no peanuts because of allergies. Easy enough. I've been bringing stuff for a few months now. Cheezits one week, beef jerky another time, fig bars, Ritz crackers, those little apple sauce pouches, normal snack stuff that kids actually eat. Never heard a single complaint from anyone. Then last week, Finn comes home and mentions this girl in his class didn't like any of the snacks I brought. I was like, okay, whatever, can't please everyone. Didn't think anything of it. This week I brought Madeline's and more apple sauce pouches, gets in the car after school and goes, mom, that girl says she's allergic to everything you bring. I asked what he meant and he said she's apparently gluten free, can't eat meat, has all these dietary restrictions. Now this was news to me because the teacher never mentioned anything and there was no list of restrictions. When I signed up, I told Finn if her diet is that complicated, her parents should probably pack her snacks. He's a sweet kid. So of course, he repeated this to the girl, the Next day and she told the teacher who told the parents. Next thing I know, the school office is calling me. The mom had complained that I was being difficult about her daughter's needs. The teacher called me after school and she was super apologetic about it. She's always been really grateful that I contribute because most parents don't. But now she's stuck in the middle and asked if I could maybe bring snacks that work for the student. I asked what the restrictions actually were. The teacher rattled off this list. No gluten, no meat, no dairy, no eggs, no nuts, obviously, no soy, nothing processed. I was like, what is this kid even eat? The teacher admitted the mom provided a list of approved snacks and it was basically saltines, plain buttered noodles and fruit snacks. I'm not a doctor, but that sounds less like allergies and more like a picky eater whose parents are catering to it. The teacher even said there's no medical documentation on file, no Epipen, no action plan, nothing. I told the teacher I appreciate her position.

My girlfriend said when I caught her with her male best friend. I left and moved on. Two years later, she crashed my wedding in a red dress screaming she was the real bride. I've been with Laura for four years, physical therapist out of Boston. Steady life, solid relationship. I've been saving for a ring for almost two years. That Friday, I clocked out early, hit the gym with my buddy Rico, then stopped for pad Thai, her favorite. Inside my jacket sat the small black box. I unlocked our apartment door. Shoes I didn't recognize by the couch, a jacket draped over the chair. The playlist wasn't hers. It was the indie garbage Nate used to play back in college. I didn't call out, carried the takeout through the living room. Down the hall, I heard laughing, hers, then a man's voice. I pushed the bedroom door open. Laura froze, blanket wrapped around her. Nate was grabbing his jeans off the floor. I set the takeout on the dresser. Pad ties getting cold. Don't stop on my account. Nate stammered, grabbed his jacket, practically fell trying to get his shoes on. I stepped aside. He sprinted out barefoot. She started talking fast. Ace. It wasn't this, just he came by to talk and one thing LED to, yeah, gravity does that, too. She pulled the blanket tighter, eyes wet. I swear it didn't mean anything. Then. Why are you crying? She tried to reach for me because I messed up. You know I love you, right? You were the Plan B, not the dream. I blinked. That's one way to say the quiet part out loud. Her face went pale. I didn't mean. Sure you did. I reached into my jacket, pulled out the velvet box, flipped it open. Guess I dodged the kneeling part. She stared. You were going to night? Yeah. I closed it, set it on the nightstand. Return policies still good. I grabbed the pad tie and walked out. Didn't slam the door, didn't look back outside. I sat in my car behind the clinic, ate cold, pad tie, looked at the ring box, sent one text. You just saved me a year's salary. Congratulations. Blocked her. The next year was rebuilding. One room apartment, work, gym, sleep routine. Laura tried everything. Long texts, emails, social media posts about healing after betrayal. I blocked it all. Then Rico dragged me to his cousin's wedding. I saw the photographer behind the camera, confident, direct, actually focused on her. Work. That camera ever take a break?

Now he calls every week asking about the house he used to own. Half of our dad left us his rental property when he passed, split 50 50. The only catch, we had to sign the transfer papers together at the lawyer's office within 90 days or it'd go to probate. My brother and I had never been close. He was the golden child star athlete, the one who could do no wrong. I was the dependable one, the one who helped dad fix the gutters, who drove him to chemo appointments, who sat with him during his last weeks. Dad died. I expected my brother to at least pretend to care about the logistics, but he was too busy posting workout videos and talking about his fitness journey to help plan the funeral. Still, this was Dad's house, the one he bought in 1987, the one he rented out for extra income after mom left. It meant something. So I handled all the estate paperwork, found the lawyer and scheduled the appointment. I texted my brother the date three weeks in advance, Tuesday, May 14th, two PM, lawyer's office downtown. We both need to be there to sign the transfer papers. He replied, got it. I sent him a reminder, a week out, then three days out, then the night before. Each time I know I'll be there. Tuesday morning, I took the day off work, wore a button up shirt, printed out all the documents the lawyer had sent me. I even stopped by my brother's apartment at noon to make sure he was awake. He answered the door and workout gear. You getting ready, I asked. Yeah. Yeah. Just gonna hit the gym quick. I'll meet you there. The appointments in two hours. Plenty of time. My gym's 10 minutes away. I didn't like it, but what was I supposed to do, drag him there? I got to the lawyer's office at 1:45, checked in with the receptionist, sat in the waiting area scrolling through my phone. At 1:55, I texted him, you close? No response. At 2:00, the lawyer called me back to his office. Older guy, kind face, big wooden desk covered in folders. Your brother running late, he asked? Apparently. Well, we'll give him a few minutes. At 2:10, I called my brother straight to voicemail. The lawyer shifted in his chair. We really do need both parties present for this transfer. I know. I'm sorry. Let me try him again. Voicemail. At 2:25, my phone buzzed, a text for my brother, except it wasn't a text. It was an Instagram Story notification. I clicked it. There he was.

Within 30 minutes, the photos were all over her Instagram story. The caption read, when you find the perfect help for your party. She even married into good families, blessed large housemaid goals. Her comment section was filling up with laughing emojis. I was in the bathroom crying when Harry finally arrived at seven PM he'd been texting me, wondering where I was. One of Olivia's friends, probably drunk, showed him the Instagram post thinking it was funny. Harry found me, saw the apron on the counter and his face went completely cold. He didn't say a word to me. He just walked straight into the living room where Olivia was still holding court. Give me your phone, he said. His voice was quiet, but everyone heard it. The room went silent. What, Terry? We're celebrating. Give me your or phone. She handed it over, laughing nervously. Harry deleted every post, every story, every photo from that night while 60 people watched in complete silence. Then he turned to face the entire party. This woman you all humiliated tonight, she's my wife, the woman I chose to spend my life with. And Olivia, since you care so much about status and money, let me remind you of something. He pulled out his phone and opened an email. Mom left you the business, but she left me the house, the family house that you've been managing and collecting 12,000 dollar a month. I'm selling it effective immediately. Olivia's Face went from confused to white in seconds. You can't. I can't. I just accepted an offer this afternoon. You've got 60 days to figure out how to run your lifestyle without that trust fund income. The room was dead silent. Olivia tried to grab his arm, but he pulled away. He took my hand and we walked out while everyone stared. Turns out their mom's will gave hair the family property but allowed Olivia to manage it and collect commercial tenant rent as supplemental income. That 12 thousand dollar monthly was funding her luxury car payments, designer shopping and that expensive condo. Harry sold the house to a developer in three weeks for 2.3 million dollars. We used part of it to buy our own place. Olivia had to downsize her life completely. She sold the condo, traded her Range Rover for a used sedan and her Instagram went quiet. She hasn't spoken to either of us since. And honestly, I'm okay with that.

Your mother's planning to come anyway, she says. You can't stop a mother from seeing her daughter's wedding. I knew she meant it. For 28 years, she'd made sure I knew my place. Megan's punching bag, both literally and emotionally. But I wasn't 7 anymore. The morning of my wedding, my hands trembled as I applied lipstick. It hit me that this day would either be everything I dreamed of or the final break with my family. So when mom and Megan arrived early, I took a deep breath and smiled like nothing had ever been wrong. I'm so glad you made it, I said, hugging them both. You have to see how beautiful everything turned out. I showed them around the lobby, pointing out the flowers and the way the sunlight hit the stained glass. The bridal suites over here. I said, keeping my tone light, you can see the aisle from this angle. It's perfect, right? Then I LED them toward the nursery. And remember the room I mentioned, the one with the perfect view of the ceremony? You'll love this. The room was just as I planned, soft lighting, padded carpet, a big screen showing the ceremony room. I smiled as they stepped inside. It's soundproof, I said. Parents can bring their babies here and still hear everything from the main hall. Mom walked in first, Megan close behind, still talking about the decorations. I'll step out. To the reception hall and say something so you can test how well it works, I said. Keeping my tone light, they both nodded. Turning toward the screen, I slipped out, pulled the door closed and turned the lock. For a second, I just stood there, palm flat against the cool metal, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. 28 years of being the good daughter ended with one small click. The pounding started immediately. Moms muffled yelling, Megan's ha, ha, ha echoing through the padded walls. But those walls were built to muffle crying babies, and they worked. I walked back to the bridal suite. The makeup artist glanced up, startled at my calm face. First time in my life, silence didn't mean waiting for the next outburst. It meant peace. When I stepped into my dress, it felt like armor. An hour later, I stood at the altar watching Max's face as he read his vows. His voice never wavered. Every word exactly as he'd written them, exactly as I dreamed. The ceremony was perfect, silent, safe. After the reception, I played dumb. Oh, my god, that door's been sticking. I told the venue about it last week. Thank goodness you could watch on the screen. Mom's face turned red. She didn't speak, just glared like I committed murder. After I forced her to watch Max's parents walk me down the aisle, before mom left the church that day, she cornered me, her face twisted with rage. You're Dead to me, she hissed. I smiled. Yeah, I Learned from the best.

Right after I got married to my husband, we started trying for a family. We painted the nursery yellow because we wanted it to be a surprise. We'd picked out names, bought tiny clothes, read all the parenting books. But after three miscarriages and two failed IVF attempts, the doctor sat us down and said it wasn't going to happen naturally. The grief was suffocating, watching everyone around us have babies while we attended baby showers with forced smile miles and went home to an empty nursery. After two years of that pain, my husband suggested adoption. I wasn't ready at first because it felt like admitting defeat, like giving up on the dream I'd held since childhood. But then I visited the foster care website one night and saw her photo, 7 years old with dark eyes that look too old for her face and expression that seemed to be bracing for disappointment. Her name was Iris and the description said she'd been in the system since she was 3. Something about her photo wouldn't leave my mind for days. I showed my husband and he felt it, too, that inexplicable pull toward this child we'd never met. We filled out the application and went through months of home studies, background checks, parenting classes and interviews. Social worker assigned to Iris's case was named Diane Murphy and she was honest about the situation in a way that Scared me, she said. Iris had been removed from her biological mother's care after neighbors reported seeing a small child left alone in an apartment for days at a time. The mother had severe addiction issues and would disappear for weeks. Iris to fend for herself. When they found her, she was 4 years old, malnourished and had been eating toothpaste because there was no food in the apartment. She'd been in three different foster homes since then, each placement failing for various reasons that Diane delicately called behavioral challenges. Asked what that meant and Diane said Iris ordered food, had severe trust issues and would sometimes hurt herself when she got overwhelmed. The description should have scared us away, but instead it made me more determined. This little girl needed someone who wouldn't give up on her like everyone else had. We met Iris for the first time at a park on a Saturday morning in October. She sat on a bench next to Diane wearing jeans that were too short and a jacket that didn't fit really. Her hair was pulled back in a messy ponytail and she wouldn't make eye contact when we said hello. My husband brought a soccer ball thinking maybe she'd want to play, but she just stared at it like she didn't understand what it was for. We sat on the bench with her for an hour trying to make conversation while she gave one word answers and kept her arms wrapped tight. Around herself. When it was time to leave, Diane asked if she wanted to see us again, and Iris shrugged on the drive.

We had supervised visits twice a week for the next two months. Slowly, so slowly, I almost didn't notice it happening. Iris started to relax around us. She'd answer questions with full sentences instead of just shrugs. She laughed once at something my husband said, then immediately looked scared like she'd done something wrong. We brought her to our house for a day visit, and she walked through every room like she was in a museum, barely touching anything, asking permission before she sat on the furniture. I made lunch, and she ate everything on her plate so fast I worried she'd choke, then asked in a whisper if there was more. I said, of course, and gave her seconds and thirds, watching her put away more food than seemed possible for someone her size. My husband caught my eye across the table, and I saw the same heartbreak I felt reflected in his face. After lunch, she asked where the bathroom was and disappeared for 20 minutes. When she came out, I noticed the and soap was half empty. Diane explained later that hoarding and overconsumption were common in kids who'd experienced severe neglect. Iris's brain was still operating from a place of scarcity, believing she had to take everything now because there might not be anything later. The official adoption Went through in February, six months after we first saw her photo. The judge asked Iris if she wanted to be part of our family, and she nodded once, still not making eye contact with anyone. We took her home that day with two garbage bags of belongings that represented everything she owned in the world. One bag had clothes that mostly didn't fit. The other had a broken toy phone, three rocks she'd apparently collected, and a blanket so worn it was barely holding together. My husband carried the bags to her new room while I helped her out of the car. She stood in our driveway looking at the house like she was waiting for someone to tell her it was a joke. I took her hand, and it was so small and cold in mine. Her room had been decorated carefully. Not the nursery we painted years ago, but a space we designed specifically for her. Purple walls because Diane said that was her favourite colour. A bed with a thick comforter and more pillows than necessary. A bookshelf with new books still in their wrappers. A desk for homework. Animals arranged on the bed. When Iris saw it, she stopped in the doorway and didn't move. I asked if she liked it, and she whispered, this is all mine. I said, yes. Everything in this room belongs to you, and no one will take it away. She walked over to the bed and touched the comforter. With just her fingertips. Like it might disappear. Then she asked something I had never expected. The rest of the

You can't afford a lawyer to fight me, I replied. You're right. She served me papers in court only to see the city's most feared, expensive divorce attorney sit down next to me. He looked at her and said, he doesn't have to afford me. I'm his older brother. Last month, my wife Jessica told me she wanted a divorce. No tears, no sadness, just cold facts. We were in our living room, the house my grandpa helped me buy, and she handed me a folder like she was firing an employee. Listen, Ryan, she said with this smug smile, I want the house. I want 70% of our savings. I want you to pay me support for five years minimum. She wasn't asking. She was telling me. I'm a middle school art teacher. I make okay money, but nothing crazy. Jessica knew this. That's why she leaned back all confident and said, let's be real here. You can't afford a good lawyer. My attorney will destroy you before you even get to court. Sign the papers and walk away. It'll be easier for everyone. I just stared at her. This woman I'd loved for eight years was trying to ruin me. She thought I was weak. She thought I couldn't fight back. So I looked at her and said exactly what she wanted to hear. You're right. The relief on her face was instant. She stood up, smoothed her dress and Said, good, I'm glad you're being smart about this. Then she walked out. Here's what Jessica knew. I had an older brother named Derek. Derek is the most expensive, most feared divorce lawyer in the entire state. Lawyers literally get nervous when they hear his name. But here's what Jessica was betting on. Derek and I hadn't spoken in six years. We'd had a huge fight after our parents died. It was over their house. I wanted to keep it for memories. Derek wanted to sell it and split the money. We said horrible things to each other and never spoke again. Jessica saw that whole fight. She figured my only powerful connection was dead. And.

She was wrong. For three days after she dropped that bomb, I was a mess. She was right. I couldn't afford to fight her. The thought of losing everything made me sick. On day four, I hit rock bottom. And that's when I did something I never thought I'd do. I called Derek. My hands were shaking as I dialed. When he answered, I barely recognized my own voice. Hey, Derek, it's Ryan. Long silence. I thought he'd hang up. Ryan, he finally said. What's wrong? I told him everything. Jessica's demands, her lawyer, her final insult about me being too poor to fight. Another silence. Then Derek's voice changed. It wasn't surprised anymore. It was protective. It was dangerous. She said, what? He asked, his voice ice cold. Don't talk to her, he said. Don't sign anything. Just show up to court next Tuesday. I'll meet you there. Court day came. I walked in alone in my only suit, looking exactly like the defeated guy Jessica expected. She was already there in an expensive power suit, laughing with her lawyer. They look so confident. I sat down at my table. Her lawyer walked over, smirking. Mister Chen, I hope you've reviewed our generous offer. Let's make this quick. I'm waiting for my lawyer. I said quietly. He actually laughed. Your lawyer? Good luck with that. Then the doors opened. Derek walked in wearing a five thousand dollar suit. The whole room went silent. Jessica's lawyer turned white. I Watched Jessica's face go from confused to horrified in about two seconds. Derek sat down next to me, opened his briefcase, and looked straight at Jessica. Good morning, he said with a cold smile. Let me introduce myself. I'm Derek Chen. I'll be representing my little brother. He doesn't have to afford me. I'm family. Jessica's lawyer stammered something about needing a minute. The judge looked amused. That's when I knew she hadn't just lost. She'd been destroyed before the battle even started.

Her name is going to be Riley. I had the nursery half painted this soft yellow color. I'd already bought tiny socks with little bears on them. Then one random Tuesday morning, there was no heartbeat at my checkup, just silence. The doctor kept moving that cold gel thing around my stomach, pressing harder. And I already knew. You just know. I spent six months barely leaving my apartment. My husband Trevor, had to basically force me to eat actual meals instead of just crackers and string cheese. I went to therapy every Thursday at 4:30. It helped a little, enough that I could finally talk about Riley without completely breaking down in the produce section of target. So this year on the anniversary, I planned a small dinner, just my parents, Trevor and my sister Megan. I put Riley's sonogram picture in a little frame on the table next to a candle. I made lasagna from scratch because cooking helped me feel normal. I even set out the good plates, the white ones with the gold edges my grandmother left me. Megan texted she'd be there at six. She showed up at 6:45 wearing this bright pink sash that said Mommy loading in glitter letters. She was carrying a whole box of cupcakes with baby footprints on them. My mom saw her first and made this weird choking sound. Surprise, Megan. Yelled, doing this little jump. We're pregnant 12 weeks today. I laughed like a full laugh. It just happened. My mouth opened and this awful laugh came out before I could stop it. Everyone turned to stare at me like I just kicked a puppy. My dad actually stood up from his chair. Trevor grabbed my hand under the table. Megan smile dropped. Seriously, you're laughing? I couldn't explain it. My throat felt like someone was squeezing it. I managed to say excuse me and basically ran to the bathroom. I sat on the edge of the tub shaking. Two minutes later, Megan knocked and walked right in without waiting. What's your problem? I thought you'd be happy for me. I specifically waited 12 weeks to make sure everything was safe.

I just bought my first home three weeks ago after saving for 6 years. Six years of living in a tiny studio apartment, eating ramen and skipping vacations. This house was everything to me. My sister Lisa is 29, one year older than me and she's always been kind of a mess with money and relationships. She's had like five serious boyfriends in the past three years. Each time she moves in with them within a month and each time it ends badly. Last Tuesday she called me sobbing. Her newest boyfriend, Marcus, had kicked her out after she found text between him and some girl from his gym. She said she just needed to store a few boxes at my place while she figured out where to move next. Just temporary, she promised. I felt bad for her so I said okay, I figured like three or four boxes, maybe some clothes and personal stuff. The next morning she shows up in a U Haul truck, not a small one either, like a full size moving truck. I watched from my window as she opened the back and there was an entire apartments worth of stuff inside. Furniture, a couch, a dining table, boxes stacked floor to ceiling, lamps, a TV, even kitchen appliances. When I came outside, she was already unloading. What is all this, I asked? Just some stuff I need to store, she Said like it was totally normal. This is way more than a few boxes, Lisa. This is everything you own. She kept unloading like I hadn't said anything. That's when she dropped the real bomb. So I was also thinking I could just crash here for a few nights, you know, until I find a new place. I stopped her right there. No, absolutely not. I didn't agree to be your storage unit or your roommate. She put down the box she was holding and stared at me. Are you serious? Right now? I'm your sister. I'm going through a breakup and you're acting like I'm some stranger? You said a few boxes. This is a moving truck and now you want to move in? It's temporary. God, you have this whole big house with three bedrooms and you're going to make me figure this out on my own? She was getting louder. Now a couple neighbours were starting to look over. I saved for years to buy this house, Lisa. I'm not turning it into a free hotel and storage facility. She started crying those angry tears where she's more mad than sad. I can't believe you. You finally get a little bit ahead in life and suddenly you're too good to help family. Mom always said you'd be like this. That pissed me off. What did mom say exactly? That you've always been selfish with your stuff, even when we were kids. I pulled out my phone. Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. I will pay for a week at an extent and it stay hotel for you and I will help you look for short term rentals tonight. But you're not moving your stuff into my house and you're not staying here. Lisa's face went red. A hotel? Are you kidding me? You're going to pay for some random hotel instead of just letting me stay in your extra bedroom? That's so wasteful. It's my money and my house. Take the offer or don't. She grabbed her phone and.

My wife Lisa and I have been together for 11 years and married for six. We have three kids under 7 years old and our marriage is completely falling apart. The biggest problem is that Lisa wants more kids, a lot more kids. Keep saying three isn't enough and she wants at least three more, maybe even more than that. I'm done with the three we have, not because I don't love them, but because I'm exhausted and broke and our house is already too small. But Lisa won't listen to anything I say. She literally told me last month that we're having at least three more kids and there's nothing I can do to stop it. Like I don't even get a vote. So we haven't had sex in five months because I'm terrified she's going to try to get pregnant on purpose. I bring up my concerns. She calls me an asshole. She says I must hate our kids if I don't want more of them. I've explained 100 times that loving the kids we have and not wanting more kids are two completely different things. He just shuts down and starts yelling. Here's the really scary part. Her last delivery with our youngest was really difficult. The doctors told us straight up that they wouldn't recommend many more pregnancies for her. It could be dangerous. When I reminded her what the doctor Said, she told me she doesn't care. She said not giving her more kids makes me manipulative. Then there's the issue with spending time with the kids. We both work full time, but when we get home, Lisa tries to hog all the time with them. If I try to help with bath time or read them a bedtime story, she acts like I'm stealing them from her. She's told me multiple times that she doesn't want me taking time with the kids away from her. I just wanna be involved with my own children. But whenever I do get time with them, she acts like she hasn't seen them in weeks, even though we all live in the same house. She'll stand in the doorway watching us with this look on her face like I'm doing something wrong. I've tried suggesting we figure out a schedule so we both get quality time with the kids and we both help with chores, but she freak.

You made a felony. You have 24 hours to fix it. The line went dead. I looked at Emma, who was coloring like nothing happened. Baby, you did all that. Why she didn't look up. You always protect me. I wanted to protect you, too. Plus, Aunt Vanessa was mean. She called you dumb last month when she thought I wasn't listening. Nobody calls my mom dumb. 24 hours later, every dollar was back.

I listened to her sob, then said simply, maybe you'll understand someday what it means to betray family. That night, I took Emma for ice cream. She got extra sprinkles. My tiny, terrifying, brilliant daughter who protected me better than any adult ever had. As we walked home, she asked, are you mad I didn't tell you first? I squeezed her hand. I'm proud you knew what to do when I couldn't. She smiled. That's what family does. The real kind, not the stealing kind from the mouths of babes. Indeed.

I warned my neighbor that his garage door sensor was broken, and he brushed me off saying I was paranoid. I work as an electrician, and I've been doing residential wiring for about six years now, specializing in home safety systems. Last Tuesday, I was coming home from work around 5 p m. And I noticed something off with his garage door. It was closing way too fast, and the safety sensor light wasn't blinking like it should. His two kids were playing basketball in the driveway and kept running in and out of the garage to grab drinks and basketballs. Every single time that door came down, I felt this knot in my stomach getting tighter and tighter. I walked over and knocked on his door. He opened it looking annoyed, like I was interrupting his dinner or something important. Your garage door sensor is malfunctioning. The safety beam isn't working properly, and that door could seriously hurt someone. He rolled his eyes and leaned against the door frame with his arms crossed. It's been like that for months now. Works fine. Nobody's gotten hurt yet, so I don't see the problem. I pulled out my phone and showed him the video I had just taken. Look at how fast it's closing. See how the sensor lights aren't on at all? If someone walks under it, the door won't stop. It'll come straight down on them with full force. He Barely glanced at my phone screen. I've lived here for 15 years. I know my own house and my own garage door better than some stranger who just moved in six months ago. I tried explaining that I literally installed these exact systems for a living, and I can tell when something's wrong. I pointed at the sensor on the side of his garage. That wire right there is disconnected. I can see it hanging from here. The sensor isn't communicating with the motor at all. He cut me off mid sentence. Stop trying to drum up business in my neighborhood. I'm not paying you to fix something that isn't broken just so you can make a quick fuck off me. His wife came to the door asking what all the commotion was about. I explained the whole situation to her, showing her the video and pointing out the disconnected wire hanging there. He interrupted, saying I was exaggerating the danger to make money off them and that I probably go door to door doing this to everyone. She looked at me apologetically, but said they talked about it later and close the door in my face. I went back to my house feeling frustrated and worried. I even called the non emergency police line asking if they could do some kind of safety check or wellfare check. They said it was private property and unless there was an immediate threat to life, they couldn't force him to fix anything. I asked what qualified as an immediate threat. The dispatcher said someone would have to actually get hurt first before they could intervene. I spent that whole evening thinking about those two kids running in and out. I barely slept at night the next day. I was in my kitchen making lunch around noon when I heard the most

Years later, when I was 8 years old, my grandparents sat me down and told me they were putting me in their will. I remember my grandpa saying I was going to college one day and this money would help me get there. He always called me his smart kid. A year later, my aunt and uncle had their first baby. My cousin Danny. Then a year after that, they had another kid, my cousin Lily. My grandparents love those babies. They babysit all the time and buy them toys and clothes. But they never changed their will. Not once did they mention adding Danny or Lily to it. My grandpa would still tell me the same same thing every time I saw him. That money is for your education. You're gonna do big things. Then when I was 11, both my grandparents died within three months of each other. First my grandma had a stroke. Then my grandpa just kind of gave up. After that, the inheritance got put into a trust that I'd get when I turned eighteen. At the funeral, nobody talked about money. My aunt and uncle seemed fine. They hugged me and told me how much my grandparents loved me. Fast forward seven years. I'm 18 now and just got access to the trust. It was $85,000. Not life changing money, but enough to pay for college and have some left Over. I didn't tell anyone except my parents, but somehow my aunt found out. She called my mom, asking questions about the trust, whether I'd gotten it yet, how much it was. My mom kept things vague, but I could tell something was up. Then last month, my uncle showed up at our house unannounced. He brought Danny and Lily with him, who are now 10 and 9. He sits down at our kitchen table and starts with his whole speech about family and fairness. Then he drops it. He says, two thirds of that money belongs to Danny and Lily. I just stared at him. He kept going, saying if my grandparents had lived longer and gotten to really know his kids, they definitely would have added them to the will. He said it wasn't fair that I got everything just be cause I was born first. My uncle even had this whole breakdown ready. He said I should get about $28,000 and each of his kids should get $28,000. Like he'd actually done the math. I asked him why he was bringing this up now, seven years after they died. He got defensive and said they'd been thinking about it for a while, but didn't want to upset me when I was younger. Then he said his kids had expenses coming up and the money would really help their family. I told him no. Just flat out no. He looked shocked, like he couldn't believe I'd actually refuse He's

She said I was drunk and that she did not feel safe sleeping next to me. I had one beer over the course of 2 hours. I was completely fine. Then she told me to sleep on the couch. I said, no. It is my bed. I pay half the rent on this apartment and I bought the bed frame with my own money from my last job. I was not about to sleep on our crappy couch that we got for free off Facebook Marketplace because she decided to make up some story in her head. Got even more mad that I said no. She ripped the blanket off me and grabbed my pillow and threw it across the room. It hit my desk lamp and the lamp fell off the desk and smashed on the floor. The light bulb shattered everywhere. I told her to stop being such a bitch and to just go to sleep so we could talk about it in the morning when she was not being crazy. That was apparently the wrong thing to say. She grabbed her phone and her charger and stormed out of the bedroom. I heard the front door slam like 30 seconds later. I did not go after her. I did not text her. I did not call her. I just laid there looking at the ceiling. I figured she went to her parents house since that is like 15 minutes away. I got up. And swept up the broken glass from the lamp and then went back to bed. I fell asleep. Around 11 the next morning, I woke up to like 20 texts from her mom. Stuff like, how could you treat my daughter this way and you are a horrible boyfriend and she deserves so much better. Her mom said she showed up crying at 1 in the morning saying I got drunk and screamed at her and threw things with just a complete lie. She threw my pillow. She broke the lamp. I had one drink. I texted her mom back and said that was not what happened and that she could check the security camera in our apartment hallway if she wanted proof I was not stumbling around drunk. Our building has cameras everywhere. Her mom did not respond. My girlfriend finally texted me around noon. She said I owed her an apology for making her feel unsafe and for calling her a name. I told her I was not apologizing for refusing to sleep on the couch in my own apartment. She said if I did not apologize, she was not coming back. I said, okay, then do not come back. She has been staying at her parents house for 5 days now. She keeps posting sad quotes on Instagram about toxic relationships.

Lily was bouncing with excitement, asking if we could surprise Mommy right away. I said yes, but that feeling in my gut was screaming at me now. At the front desk, I asked them to call Emma's room. No answer. The receptionist tried twice. Then she said something that made my blood run cold. It looks like Missus Thompson checked in with a plus 1. A plus 1? What plus 1? The receptionist got uncomfortable and wouldn't give me more details. She looked down at her computer screen, then back at me with this question that said she knew exactly what was going on. Her face went pale when I asked her to repeat what she just said. I grabbed our room keys. We were on the same floor, just down the hall from Emma. I told the kids we'd get settled first, then surprise mom, but I couldn't wait. After getting the kids into our room with snacks and the TV on, I told Lucas I'd be right back. I walked down that hallway like I was heading to my own execution. My hands were shaking when I knocked on Emma's door. No answer. I knocked again, harder this time. Then I heard it. Movement inside. Whispered voices. The sound of someone scrambling. My heart was pounding so hard, I thought it might explode. Load! The door opened just a crack. Emma's face appeared, and I swear I watched every emotion flash across it. In two seconds. Shock, confusion, then pure panic. Her hair was messy. She was wearing the hotel robe. Jason, what are you doing here? Before I could answer, I heard a man's voice from inside the room. Everything okay, babe? Babe? 20, two years of marriage, two. Two kids down the hall who just wanted to surprise their mom. And I'm standing in a Seattle hotel hallway listening to another man call my wife Babe. Emma tried to close the door. I pushed it open, and there he was. Some guy I'd never seen before, sitting on the bed in his boxers, looking just as shocked as I felt. The surprise wasn't ours after all. It was mine.

I shrugged and changed one name on a state renewal form before clocking out. After our 50 million dollar valuation vanished overnight, our frantic general counsel burst into the boardroom. He stared at my boss and whispered, who did you fire yesterday? I'm Sarah Bennett, 38, and I just spent 11 years as a senior regulatory specialist at Phoenix Medical Technologies. Nobody knew what I did. Nobody cared until I was gone. My job was simple but critical. I kept all our medical device licenses active across 12 states. Every renewal, every form, every regulatory filing that kept our 50 million dollar company legal. I was invisible. The quiet person in the corner cubicle who made sure the machine kept running. Then Derek Mason showed up. Derek was our new VP of operations, fresh from some tech startup. He walked in wearing designer sneakers and talking about cutting the fat and eliminating redundancy. Within his first week, he called my department bureaucratic theater in an email with a laughing emoji. When he finally noticed me, he squinted like I was a smudge on his glasses. Remind me what you do again? He asked. I explained the state licensing, the F D A. Coordination, the regulatory compliance that our three products on the market. He nodded like I just described my stamp collection. Boring. Unnecessary. Expendable. Three days later, I got a meeting invite. Quick chat. I knew what it meant. Derek sat Behind his new standing desk, sipping some overpriced coffee. Sarah, look, nothing personal. We're streamlining. Legal can handle compliance stuff. You're just overhead. He said it like he was telling me they ran out of parking spots. No emotion, no guilt. I didn't argue, didn't cry. Just nodded. But here's the thing about compliance work. It's invisible. Until it isn't. Before I packed my stuff, I had one form left to submit. Our Texas Medical device manufacturing license, due in four days. It was the big one. The license that authorized us to produce our flagship cardiac monitor. The product that made up 60% of our revenue. The form had one critical field. Authorized agent of record. That was me. My name, my credentials, my certifications that I maintained for over a decade. I deleted my name, typed in Derek Mason. Not sabotage, just accuracy. He was the VP now, right? Technically, he should be the agent. I saved it, submitted it, logged out, dropped my badge at reception and left. No drama, no revenge speech. Just one name change. Two weeks later, my phone rang. Unknown number. Sarah, it's Marcus Chen, general counsel at Phoenix. His voice was shaking. We need you back. Emergency. Name, your price. I let him sweat for three seconds. What happened? The Texas license, it got rejected. Then Arizona rejected our appeal. Then Nevada. Then he stopped, took a breath. Our manufacturing authorization is suspended. Medtech pulled out of our Series B funding round. This morning, our evaluation dropped from $50 million to basically zero overnight. Why? I asked, though I knew the forms

The airbag dust was still settling when I heard the EMTs voice. We're calling your emergency contact now. My phone was shattered on the passenger floor, green cracked into a spider web. Through the ringing in my ears, I heard them dialed my older brother, the person I'd listed years ago. Without a second thought, his voice came through the speaker, groggy and annoyed.

Bryce never showed. Broken leg, fractured wrist, three cracked ribs, mild concussion. The doctor said I was lucky. Six weeks minimum before I could walk without crutches, probably longer before I'd be back to normal. Jake helped me home, set me up. On the couch, grabbed my prescriptions. You should call your parents, he said gently. Let them know what Bryce did. I thought about it. Then I checked Twitter. Bryce had posted 4 hours after the accident, Karma's real, y'all. Some people really gotta learn the hard way. The replies were full of laughing emojis, people asking what happened. Bryce playing it mysterious, dropping hints about family drama and people who deserved what they got. My chest felt hollow. This wasn't sibling rivalry. This was something colder. I didn't call my parents. I didn't call Bryce. I didn't post anything. I just existed.

My sister Emma has been copying everything I do since we were kids. It started innocent enough with wanting the same toys or clothes, but by high school, it got seriously annoying. She'd watch what I wore, then show up the next day in basically the same outfit. If I got highlights, she'd get highlights two weeks later. When I started playing guitar, suddenly she needed guitar lessons, too. The worst part was she'd always do it slightly better or get more attention for it. Like when I joined Drama Club and got a small part in the spring play, she auditioned for the fall show and somehow landed the lead. Everyone kept saying how talented the Harris sisters were, but really they meant how talented Emma was at copying me and making it look effortless. Last month, I finally hit my breaking point. I've been growing my hair out for two years, and it was finally getting to that perfect length where it looked really good in pictures. Then Emma announced she was growing hers out, too. She kept asking me about hair masks and what products I used, and I could see exactly where this was heading, so I came up with a plan. I told her I was thinking about getting a really dramatic haircut, like a pixie cut, because long hair was getting boring and hard to manage. I even looked up pictures on my phone and Showed her saying how cute and edgy it would look. She seemed interested but didn't say much. Then I started dropping hints about this amazing salon downtown that supposedly specialised in short cuts. I made up this whole story about how my friend's cousin went there and looked like a completely different person afterward. I even created a fake Instagram post on my close friend's story showing some random pixie cut photo I found online, captioning it thinking about this vibe. Emma took the bait completely. She kept asking me when I was going to book the appointment and said maybe we could go together. I told her I was still thinking about it, but that I heard you had to book weeks in advance because the stylist was so popular. Two days later she comes home with the shortest haircut I've ever seen on her. Not even a cute pixie cut, but like an actual boy's haircut where you could see her scalp in some spots. Apparently she'd gone to some cheap place in the mall and just told them to cut it all off because she wanted to beat her sister to the punch. She looked absolutely horrible. The cut was uneven, way too short, and completely wrong for her face shape. She was clearly trying to act confident about it, posting selfies and talking about how freeing it felt, but I could tell she was panicking inside. The best part was when my mom came home and Literally gasped when she saw Emma. She kept asking what happened and if this was some kind of breakdown. Emma had to explain that she just wanted to change, but even she couldn't hide how awful it looked. I acted all supportive and told her it looked great, while secretly being thrilled that for once she jumped ahead of me and totally screwed herself over. I kept

I shook his hand, welcomed him, then proceeded to destroy everyone at Cody names while paying them zero attention. Halfway through the night, Tara cornered me. You don't even care that I'm here with someone else? Why would I? We're friends. Friends date people. She couldn't answer because there was no answer. That didn't admit she wanted me to pine for her while she found herself. But the best part, her bestie Marissa had been extra friendly all night. Kept finding excuses to talk to me, laugh at my jokes. Next morning, Tara texted. What was that with you and Marissa? We were just talking. Friends talk. She's my best friend. And I'm your friend, too, right? Friends can be friends with each other's friends. By week three, Connor from yoga had ghosted Tara. Meanwhile, Marissa invited me to a comedy show. The date was fantastic. She was actually hilarious, something I'd never noticed when she was just Tara's friend. When Tara found out, she exploded. You can't date my best friend. It's girl code. I thought I was your friend, not your ex. I really don't understand. Friends don't have dibs on who their friends can date. She called 17 times, put my phone on silent. Sunday morning, 6 a M, she's pounding on my door. You're doing this to hurt me. I'm living my life. You're the one who decided we shouldn't be Together. That's when her true entitlement showed. She started calling mutual friends. Revenge stories. She tried sabotaging my work, calling my office claiming I was having a mental health crisis. She even faked a pregnancy scare, then conveniently got her period the next day. Her biggest mistake was showing up at Marissa's work, causing a scene. Security escorted her out. The restraining order was her wake up call. That and getting fired for missing work during her meltdowns. Last I heard, she moved back with her parents and works part time at a bookstore. She sent one final email. You turned my best friend against me, made me look crazy, ruined my life, all because you couldn't handle being just friends. Turns out giving someone exactly what they ask for is the cruelest thing you can do.

Yesterday he put on headphones and cried. The fever spiked to 104 while Liam was singing in the bathtub. One minute he was humming Daniel Tiger off key. The next his eyes rolled back and his body went rigid. I screamed for my wife Nora, and we wrapped him in a towel, his skin burning against my chest. The er doctor took one look at his stiff neck and said the word that stops parents hearts, meningitis. What they didn't tell us in that moment, what we discovered six days later when Liam came home, was that the bacteria had already destroyed his cochlear nerve completely, irreversibly. At age 6, my son went from singing constantly to living in total silence. And the audiologist who delivered the diagnosis said there was nothing anyone could do. No hearing aids would help. No surgery could fix it. Liam was profoundly deaf and would be for the rest of his life. I watched him try to talk to his four year old sister Penny the day after we got the diagnosis, watched him yell, thinking he was speaking normally. Watched Penny's face crumble in confusion and fear at her brother's distorted voice. That's when something broke inside me. Not broke like giving up, broke like the moment you realize you'll do anything, break any rule, spend any amount of time to fix what feels unfixable. Liam spiraled fast. Within three months, he'd stopped trying to Talk, stop playing with other kids. Spent hours sitting in his room staring at nothing. His 2nd grade teacher called weakly with concerns. He wasn't participating, wasn't socializing, seemed depressed in ways that terrified her. We tried sign language, but Liam hated it, would throw fits and cover his eyes so he didn't have to watch us gesture. He wanted his old life back, couldn't understand why we couldn't just make his ears work again. The worst part was watching him watch penny. She'd dance around the living room to songs he couldn't hear, and he'd sit on the couch with tears running down his face, his small hands pressed against this speaker, trying to feel vibrations that meant nothing. Music had been his favorite thing. He'd sung constantly before the meningitis, made up songs about dinosaurs and trucks and whatever crossed his mind. Now all of that was gone, and the kid who remained was angry and scared and disappearing into himself. By his 7th birthday, Liam had essentially stopped smiling. That's when I started lying to my wife about where I was going. Three nights a week, I told Nora I joined a grief support group for parents of disabled children. That wasn't technically untrue. I had joined one, attended twice.

You got a card. Victor got a card. You're not crazy. I wasn't crazy. I've been conditioned to accept being an afterthought. Day 7, mom posted on Facebook, when your children vanish without a word, you wonder if the world is upside down. I posted a photo at a Lisbon cafe. Sometimes the best birthday gift is. Then my boss emailed, your mom? Called the office. Everything okay? They were dragging people into this who had no business being involved. I sent one message, you didn't worry when I was holding a cupcake alone at your house. Don't start now. A month later, mom emailed a photo, my childhood bedroom, bed gone. Books boxed, desk replaced with a treadmill. Didn't think you were coming back. Figured we'd use the space. No, I love you. Just that. Then Victor posted on Facebook, Family isn't about who runs off when things get hard. It's about who stays. Proud to help mom and dad rebuild after Leo's betrayal. Photo showed my room repainted, my diploma gone, replaced with Victor's business photo. Mom commented, sometimes the prodigal son doesn't return, but the son who stays builds the future. They were rewriting the story, making me the villain. I posted the truth. For those who've heard a story about me, here's mine. On my brother's birthday, our parents rented a lakehouse and hired a chef. On mine, I got a cupcake and a card saying, maybe next year when I Expressed, hurt. I was told I was too sensitive. I photographed it, left quietly and flew to Lisbon. That wasn't a tantrum. It was a boundary. For years, I played the role they needed. Quiet, helpful, low maintenance, milestone skipped. Emotions dismissed. To those saying I should have spoken up, I did multiple times. It didn't matter until I stopped playing along. I didn't run. I chose peace. Within hours, hundreds of comments. I been the background sibling, too. Thank you for saying what so many can't. Cousin Danielle. I always thought something was off. I see you now, mom. Some people air their wounds instead of healing them. Victor, congrats on your pity parade. I didn't respond. My parents never contacted me again. No apology, no acknowledgement, just silence. Two years later, I'm still in Lisbon. I found a community here. People who see me every April 5th. I buy myself the biggest cup.

It wasn't until my seventh birthday that I knew something was wrong with me. I was always in some type of pain or another. When I would tell my mom, she would say, it must be a cold. Go sleep it off. Sleeping it off never worked. Take some tylenol. Only ease the pain enough to function. Why won't you take me to the doctors? I sobbed in absolute agony. You're faking it so there's no reason to. My mom would always respond that way every time I asked. It left me feeling like I was insane, that the pain was all mental coming out as physical symptoms. I never questioned her. When I hit my teens, it would only end in a screaming match that took almost everything out of me. I would sob in my room as my younger sister tried to ease my twitching muscles. This isn't normal, Maya would say. It hurts so bad. But once she was done with them, massage, it did always feel better. My head drops. Thank you, Maya. It would become a ritual. After school and before bed, Maya would massage my muscles to keep them from locking up, twitching or staining at random times. It hurts so bad, I muttered as I made Maya and myself some lunch. Why are you so overdramatic? My mom asked as she heard me. Because it feels Like I am a pulled wire and one more twist and my whole body falls apart. Quit faking it! God, why can't I have a normal kid? I gaped at my mom. Mom, Maya is extremely talented in school for her age. That doesn't make her not normal. My mom rolls her eyes. My the excellent and you the lazy liar! I grit my teeth. What the heck, mom? I say before turning around and making my way to Maya. Maya has tears flowing down her face as I give her a hug. You are brilliant and don't let anyone tell you differently. She squeezes my hand back. You are not lazy and I believe you. Glint enters my eyes go watch the door. Maya does as I ask, and I finally call a doctor on my behalf. It did help that I was 17 and could schedule a doctor's appointment on my own. I didn't need a parent either. The appointment was set for this coming Friday. Maya just looks at me and nods. Good for you. Friday came and I still felt like I was an imposter that was about to waste a doctor's time. I drive up to the doctors and park.

I stood tall and said, if that is what you wish, then consider me as if I never existed. Then I walked out. 30 minutes later, the whole party panicked. I'm Maya, 28, a freelance graphic designer. My brother Jason is a cardiac surgeon. My sister sunny, just made partner at 26. Teach art to kids on weekends. To my parents, I might as well be unemployed. At their 35th anniversary party, 150 guests filled the venue. My mom told Aunt Marla I was still doing my little drawings and that they keep hoping I'll grow out of it. I've just been featured in a design magazine for a major tech rebrand. He laughed like it was a child's hobby. During speeches, dad praised Jason for saving lives and sunny for making waves in business. He looked right past me, didn't say my name once. Then mom took the mic. We've been truly blessed with Jason and sunny, our two amazing children. Two children. I found them with their friends. Afterward, Mrs. Gibson mentioned me. Mom's smile went brittle. Honestly, sometimes I wonder what we did to deserve such a disappointment. Jason and sunny give us such joy. But, Maya. She shook her head. Dad put his hand on her shoulder. It's been difficult. You raise your children with certain hopes and expectations, and when one of them just refuses to live up to their potential, it's heartbreaking. I'm standing right Here, I said. We know. Mom replied, not even looking at me. We always known you were there, Maya. Sometimes we wish you were never born. Our lives would have been so much simpler with just two children who actually appreciated everything we did for them. The room went silent. People stared. My hands started shaking. I sat down. My wine glass. Carefully. I looked at my father. He just looked tired, annoyed. I'd spent 28 years trying to earn their love. I paid for my own art school because they said they wouldn't waste money on it. I built a successful career despite them. Fortune 500 clients, design awards, a waiting list for my classes. And suddenly, I was done. I straightened my spine. If that is what you wish, then consider me as if I never existed. I turned to dad. You just got your desire. You now have two children instead of three. Congratulations. I looked around at the shocked faces. For anyone who cares, it was never that I didn't appreciate what they did for me. It's that they never appreciated who I am. There's a difference. I walked out. My heels clicked on marble. Jason called my name. I kept walking. In my car, I sobbed for 20 minutes. Not just for tonight. For everything. Every dismissive comment, every disappointed look. Every time I wasn't enough. When I finally checked my phone, 38 missed calls, dozens of texts. Jason, where did you go? Everyone's freaking Out. Dad had to sit down. Mom's crying. What did you think would happen, sunny? You made a scene. Really mature, Maya. Then later, okay? I heard what they actually said. Call me. Mom's texts escalated from you've embarrassed us to your father isn't feeling well. If something happens to him because of your stunt, it's on you. I stared at that. Not, we're sorry, just. We need to talk. Like I was the problem.

I'm getting impatient. I stared at my phone, rereading the message 3 times to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding. This was Lana, my stepsister, the girl whose mom married my dad two years ago. I typed back quickly, Lana, what the hell? You're my sister. The reply came instantly, stepsister, big difference. Then another message, and I've liked you way before our parents even met. You know that. I genuinely had no idea. We'd known each other since our parents started dating three years ago, but she'd never given any indication she was into me. Another text, I've been waiting for you to make a move for 3 years. At some point, you need to grow a pair and just do it already. My hands were shaking as I typed. This is insane. We live in the same house. Our parents are married. Her response made my balls shrink. Oh, they're not home right now. I'm literally down the hall. Stop being a coward. I sat there frozen, hearing footsteps in the hallway outside my door, realizing she was actually coming to my room. My door opened before I could lock it. Lana walked in wearing one of my old hoodies and shorts, closing the door behind her. We need to talk about this, I said. Sitting on my bed like this was completely normal. I backed up against My desk, Lana, no, this is wrong. We can't. She rolled her eyes. You're making this way more dramatic than it needs to be. Our parents got married. We didn't not actually related. I tried to explain that it didn't matter, that it would destroy our family, that I had a girlfriend. She just laughed. Claire, please. You've been with her for like 6 months. I've known you for 3 years. My phone buzzed, a text from Claire asking what I was doing. Lana saw me looking at it. You gonna tell her I'm in your room that we're having this conversation? I wasn't going to tell Claire anything because how would I even explain this situation? Lana moved closer. Look, I've been patient. I didn't say anything when our parents started dating because I thought we'd figure it out eventually. Then they got engaged and I thought, okay, after the wedding, we'll deal with this. But it's been two years since they got married and you're still pretending like there's nothing between us because there is nothing between us.

But the surprise wasn't ours. Look, I thought I was being the perfect husband. My wife Emma had been in Seattle for almost a week on some consulting gig, and our kids were missing her like crazy. Lucas, 13, was moping around the house, and Lily, nine, kept asking when Mommy was coming home. So I got this brilliant idea. Why not fly out and surprise her? I booked three tickets that same day, got the kids excused from school, called in a favor at work. The whole time, I'm picturing Emma's face when she opens that hotel door. I hadn't done something spontaneous like this in forever. I was feeling pretty proud of myself, honestly. Here's where things got weird, though. I tried calling Emma that morning to hear her voice, but it went straight to voicemail. I texted her, too. Nothing. By evening, still no response. I figured she was just slammed with meetings. Seattle was hosting some huge conference. No big deal, right? Wrong. On the flight, I tried calling three more times. Voicemail every single time. Not even a ring. That knot in my stomach that started the night before, it was getting tighter. Lucas noticed me checking my phone constantly and called me out on it. I played it cool, but honestly, something felt off. Emma always made time for the kids, even during her busiest Trips. We landed Thursday night around 8 p m. Rental car, nightmare. Traffic, hungry kids, you know the drill. The whole time, I'm thinking, maybe Emma can join us for a late dinner once we get to the hotel. I tried calling again as we pulled up to the Hilton. This time it actually rang, but she didn't answer. In the lobby, I told the kids to wait on the couches while I checked us in and found out Emma's

I watched her through the office window, on the phone, gesturing wildly at her computer. Two other staff members stared at The monitor, then at me, then back at the screen. Katie came back, white as paper. Sir, she said, voice trembling, I need you to stay exactly where you are. Don't move. I need to call someone. What's wrong? Just please wait. Twenty minutes later, the door burst open. Three men in expensive suits stormed in. The lead guy was maybe 65, silver hair, charcoal suit that cost more than my car used to. He walked straight to me and just stared. After 32 years, he whispered, we finally found you. The man's name was Richard Thornton, CEO of Thornton Pharmaceuticals. They took me to a back office, all dark wood and leather chairs. Mister Williams, Richard said, what we discovered in your blood is miraculous. I'm dying. I said, what? No. He laughed. You have a genetic mutation.

I've had type 1 diabetes since I was 11 years old. It's just part of my life at this point. I take insulin. I watch what I eat. And I've never had any major problems with it. But my husband, Jake, acts like it doesn't even exist. We didn't live together before we got married, so I don't think he really understood how much my diabetes affects my daily routine. Like I have to make sure I always have snacks with me when we go out. I need to check my blood sugar regularly. And I absolutely cannot drink regular soda because the sugar will mess me up. At first, it was just little annoying things. We'd go to a restaurant and I'd order a Diet Coke. The waitress would bring me regular Coke by mistake. I'd politely ask her to switch it out. Jake acted like I was being the most difficult person on the planet. He'd sigh really loudly and say seriously under his breath like I was making some huge scene. Or we'd be heading out somewhere and I'd grab a granola bar or some crackers to put in my purse. He'd be like, we're literally going to be gone for two hours. You don't need to pack a survival kit, but I do need snacks. If my blood sugar drops and I don't have anything to eat, I could literally Pass out. The worst part was when he started accusing me of being dramatic. One time my blood sugar got low and I felt dizzy and shaky. I told him I needed to sit down for a minute and eat some thing. He rolled his eyes and said I was overreacting. Another time we were supposed to be intimate and I felt my blood sugar dropping. So I said I needed to check it first and have a snack. He got so mad at me. He said, are you seriously faking low blood sugar right now to get out of this? I just stared at him in shock when he saw my face. He tried to laugh it off and say he was joking, but he definitely wasn't joking. He actually thought I would fake a medical condition to avoid being with him. But the absolute worst thing happened three months ago. We were supposed to go to his friend's wedding out of town. It was going to be a long day with the ceremony and reception. I told Jake we needed to make sure we had time to stop and eat between events because I needed real food, not just wedding appetizers. He said I was being ridiculous and that I could just eat at the reception. I tried to explain that I couldn't wait that long without proper food, but he got annoyed and said I was ruining the day with my food schedule. So I just stopped. Arguing and figured I'd make it work somehow. The wedding was beautiful, but by the time we got to the reception, I was feeling really off. My blood sugar had been all over the place because I hadn't eaten properly all day. I felt nauseous and exhausted. Jake kept telling me to just power through it. That night, I woke up vomiting. I couldn't stop throwing up and I felt like I couldn't breathe. Jake drove me to the emergency room and they told me I had DKA, which is basically when your body goes into crisis mode from not having enough insulin. I had never had this happen in my entire life. I was in the hospital for almost three weeks. When I finally got discharged, the nurse gave me all this paperwork about managing diabetes. I told her I already knew all this stuff since I'd had diabetes since I was 11. She looked confused and asked how this happened then if I knew how to manage it. I didn't say anything, but we both knew Jake is how it happened. His refusal to take my condition seriously had put me in the hospital. Even after all that, he still doesn't get it. Last month, we were going on a cruise for his sister's wedding. At security, they asked if we had any medications in our bags. Jake just said no without even thinking they were about to take my insulin away until I jumped in and explained That, yes.

I thought I'd never hear from any of them again. Then, exactly one year after the wedding that never happened, someone knocked on my door at 2:00am. I opened it to find Vanessa standing there. At first, I didn't recognize her. Her left eye was swollen, nearly shut. Bruises covered her arms. She was trembling, mascara streaking down her face. Owen, she whispered. Please. I didn't know where else to go. Every instinct told me to slam the door. She destroyed me. Chosen him. But seeing her like that, I couldn't. I let her in, made her tea. She broke down completely. Garrett had changed after the wedding. Started monitoring her phone, demanded passwords to all her accounts, controlled every dollar she spent. Isolated her from her friends, even her family. He said I was lucky to have him. She sobbed. That no one else would want me, that I'd thrown away my chance with you and should be grateful. When she tried to leave last week, he grabbed her by the throat, told her if she left, he'd destroy her, that his lawyers would bury her, that my parents would never believe her over him. She'd finally escaped while he was on a business trip. Nowhere to go, no money of her own. Too ashamed to call old friends. Why me? I asked. After everything? Because you're the only person I know who understands what he's really like. What they're all really like. She was right. I knew exactly how my family operated, how they protect Garrett no matter what he did. I could have turned her away. Part of me wanted to. But another part remembered the man I used to be. The one who believed in doing the right thing, even when it hurt. Get some rest, I said. Tomorrow we're going to the police. The next morning, I drove her to the station. She filed a report, showed them the bruises, the controlling texts, the financial records proving he trapped her. I called a lawyer friend who specialized in domestic cases, helped her file for a restraining order. Gave a statement about Garrett's history of manipulation and my parents enabling. Two days later, my mom called. I almost didn't answer. How could you? She screamed. You're destroying your brother's reputation after everything he's given you. Given me? I said. He stole my fiance. You supported it, told me he was better for her, remember? That's different. This is what better looks like, mom. This is the man you chose over me. The one you said would make her happier. Look at her face and tell me you made the right call. Silence. He told me I'd thank him one day. I continued. You were right. I'm thankful. Thankfully, he showed me exactly who you all are before I wasted more of my life on you. I hung up. Haven't heard from them since. Vanessa's staying with a friend now. Restraining order in place. She starts therapy next week.

So I treated her exactly like I treat my other friends, with boundaries. Tara and I had been together for two years, living together for one. We were talking about future plans, her sister's wedding next summer where I was supposed to be her plus 1. Then on a random Thursday evening, she sat me down for the talk. I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore. She said, I think we should transition to being friends. We get along so well, have the same friend group. We make amazing friends but not amazing partners. Here's what killed me, she said. All this while already having packed a bag. Her friend Marissa was picking her up in an hour. She planned this whole thing down to having somewhere to stay. You've already got an exit strategy. I said, we're adults. We're friends. We can make this work. I sat there processing two years living together, talking about kids someday. Now she wants to be buddies. Okay, I said, yeah, let's be friends. She actually smiled, relieved, like I just agreed to her perfect plan where she gets to dump me but keep all the benefits of having me in her life. The next morning, I did exactly what Tara asked. I treated her like a friend. That's when I Learned she had a very different definition of friendship than I did. First text came at 7 A. M, could you drop off my work laptop? Sure. I'll leave it at the front desk of your office. Monday, can't you bring it by Marissa's? I need it for the weekend. I've got plans Monday works better. She didn't like that, but what was she gonna say? We are just friends now. Week, Tara started cracking. She showed up at the apartment while I was at work, still using her key, helped herself to groceries, did laundry, took a shower. I texted her, I'll need the key back. My friends don't have keys to my place. This is ridiculous. We live together. We used to live together. Now we're friends. Different relationship, different boundaries. She came by that evening, furious. You changed the locks. You no longer live here. Here's a box of your stuff. I'm treating you exactly like I treat my friends. None of them have keys to my place. But I'm not just any friend. According to you. That's exactly what you are. The real kicker came at game night with our friend group. I showed up solo. She showed.

I was heartbroken until my 9 year old daughter said, mom, don't worry, I handled it. Then days later, my sister called screaming. I stared at the screen showing zero in all three accounts. My sister Vanessa had full access as my financial power of attorney after my accident last year. Now she taken everything and disappeared with her boyfriend, Marcus. The bank manager looks sympathetic but helpless. The transfers were authorized. There's nothing we can do without proof of fraud. 12 years of savings gone. Emma's college fund wiped out. Vanessa had left a single text. Sorry, sis, Marcus and I need a fresh start at home. I collapsed on the couch. Emma found me there still in my work clothes, staring at nothing. Mom, you okay? I tried smiling, but tears came instead. Aunt Vanessa took all our money, baby. Everything. I expected crying, maybe fear. Instead, Emma's face went oddly calm. She sat beside me and patted my hand like I was the child. Don't worry, mom, I handled it. My brain couldn't process those words. What do you mean you handled it? She smiled the strange knowing smile that didn't belong on a 9 year old's face. Last week when Aunt Vanessa was over, I heard her on the phone with Marcus. She was talking about taking money and running away to Mexico. She didn't know I was in the hallway. My heart stopped. Emma, why Didn't you tell me? I did better than tell you, she said simply. I took pictures of her computer when she left it open. All her emails with Marcus, the flight confirmations, the rental car, even the Airbnb address in Cabo. Then I sent everything to grandma. I blinked. Send it to Grandma? Emma nodded. Seriously. Grandma's scary when she's mad. Remember when that lady at the store was mean to you? Grandma made her cry. I figured she could fix this. Before I could respond, my phone rang. Unknown number. I answered to Vanessa's voice, high pitched and panicked. You ruined everything. How could you do this to me? Vanessa, where are you? The police are here, she screamed at the Airbnb. Grandma somehow got the FBI involved. They're saying wire fraud, crossing state lines, something about federal charges. Make them stop. My hand shook. The FBI, Emma whispered. Grandma's boy.

She said I was holding her back financially because I refused to invest in real estate and wasted money on rent every month. Then she dropped the bomb. She wanted half of everything, including half the rent payments I'd made over six years so she could get her share of our housing costs back. She actually calculated it, $54,000. He said since we were married, she was entitled to half of all money spent on our living situation. I just nodded and said, okay. The divorce process started. Jessica hired this aggressive lawyer who kept sending letters demanding financial records. They wanted bank statements, pay stubs, proof of rent payments. I gave them everything except the deed to the apartment. We got to the settlement meeting. Jessica walked in with Trevor, which was bold. Her lawyer laid out the demands, half of savings, half of my car, and the big one, $27,000 as her share of rent payments made during the marriage. That's when I slid the apartment deed across the table. Jessica's face went blank. Her lawyer picked it up and just stared at it. The deed was in my name. Purchase date was 8 months before I even met Jessica. Her lawyer asked why this wasn't disclosed. I said nobody asked if I owned property. They asked for rent payment records and I gave them what they asked for, nothing, because there were no rent payments. Jessica started screaming. She called me a liar and a fraud, said I tricked her. Her lawyer tried calming her down, but she was going nuclear. Trevor just sat there looking uncomfortable. Here's where it got good. Because we were married, the apartment was considered marital property, even though I bought it before we met. But in our state, premarital assets stay separate unless marital funds were used to improve them. Never used a single dollar of our joint money on that apartment. I paid the property taxes and utilities from my separate account that existed before we met. Jessica's lawyer tried arguing that I deceived her about our financial situation, but my lawyer pointed out that Jessica committed adultery, which we had documented proof of. In our state, that affects asset division. The judge was not happy with either of us, but the law was clear. I kept the apartment. Jessica got nothing from it. No rent reimbursement because there was no rent. The 60,000 I'd saved went to me because it came from my separate premarital account. Jessica had to split the legal fees with Trevor because she couldn't afford her lawyer anymore.

When I bought my first used car, I was young, excited, and way too trusting. I went to this dealership planning to buy a modest Honda I could afford, but the salesman, all smiles and slick talk, convinced me to upgrade to a slightly pricier model that had just been traded in that same day. It was still in their service bay, but he handed me a neat little checklist showing everything that had been inspected and replaced. The one thing that stood out brakes placed. That gave me peace of mind. A few days after taking it home though, I noticed a light squeak whenever I press the brakes. I called the dealership and the guy on the phone confidently told me, oh, Honda's do that. Totally normal. I even wrote down his name, the time, and the date just in case. I asked a few people about it and everyone said the same thing, so I shrugged it off. Fast forward four months and that normal squeak turned into a high pitched wheel. By the end of the month it sounded like metal grinding on metal every time I stopped. I finally took the car back to the dealership. The mechanic did a quick look and came back shaking his head. Your brakes are shot. You've got maybe 5% left. We'll need to replace everything. That'll be $490. I was stunned. Less than 5,000 Miles and brand new brakes were already gone. I talked to the service manager, but he wasn't interested in helping. I found my salesman, then the assistant manager. No one cared. The paperwork said the brakes had been replaced, so as far as they were concerned, the issue was on me. Eventually, I reached the general manager. He looked me dead in the eye and said, son, you're young. Guys like you drive fast and break hard. I've replaced brakes at 2,000 miles before. I couldn't believe it, but I needed the car, so I paid. When I. I picked it up, the car drove fine for about 15 minutes until one of the brake pads literally came loose. On the way home, I pulled over and called a tow truck. The dealership had to cover the towing, and I told the driver to take the scenic route back since they were paying by the mile. The next day, they said nothing, and I didn't bother to argue.

So my coworker Jordan and I have been friends for about eight years. We work at the same accounting firm and he's genuinely one of the best people I know. When my dad died three years ago, Jordan covered all my clients for two weeks and wouldn't let me pay him back. His wife, Serena got diagnosed with breast cancer six months ago and it's been destroying them financially. The treatments alone are $3,000 a month after insurance. And their car broke down, transmission completely shot. And Jordan just broke down in the break room. He was trying to figure out how to get Serena to her chemo appointments four times a week while still making it to work. I drive right past the cancer center on my way to the office. So I told him I'd take her. No big deal, right? I have a reliable SUV, comfortable seats and it literally adds maybe 10 minutes to my commute. Jordan almost cried when I offered. I never met Serena, but I figured she'd be grateful. The first week was fine. Serena would get in the car, say thanks, and we drive in comfortable silence. But by week two, things started changing. One morning I had my podcast on, just NPR at low volume, and she reached over and turned it off without asking. I can't handle voices right now, she said. I understood. Chemo must be rough. The next day, she grabbed my phone while I was driving, disconnected it from Bluetooth and connected hers. Suddenly, Metallica was blasting at 7 a. M. This helps with my nausea, she explained. I just nodded and turned it down a little. She turned it back up. I said, it helps with my nausea. By week three, she stopped asking and started demanding. We're stopping at Starbucks. Not a question. The first time I mentioned it would make me late. So tell them you're helping a cancer patient. What are they gonna do? Fire you? She laughed. It made me 20 minutes late and my boss pulled me aside. I'd never been late in five years. Don't make this a habit, he warned. The next appointment, she wanted Starbucks again. When I said I couldn't be late twice, she stared at me cold. Wow, I'm literally dying and you can't get me coffee. Jordan said, you were a good person, so I stopped. Then the waiting problem.

She left me for a fun guy who parties every night. But now she wants me back because he won't grow up or help with her kid. We've been married for four years with two kids, Emma, 8, and Jake, 6. I work in it security making six figures. Not exciting, but it pays well. Sarah was a stay at home mom who started hanging out with divorced women from her yoga class who acted like they were still 22. The complaint started small. We never do anything fun anymore. Then escalated to wanting me to hire babysitters so we could go clubbing on Tuesday nights with two kids at home and me up at 6:00am for work. You've turned into this boring old man, she'd say. I'm 35, not 65. I'm not ready to be dead yet. Her yoga friends introduced her to Tyler, 28 years old, bartender, drives a least BMW he can't afford, lives with three roommates. Erra started coming home talking about how Tyler did this or Tyler said that, how he was teaching them to live in the moment. The breaking point came the night before Thanksgiving. I was prepping food for the next day. My parents were coming over, her sister's family, too. Sarah walked in dressed for a nightclub. Where are you going out with the girls? Tyler knows the Owner of this new place. It's the night before Thanksgiving. We have family coming tomorrow. God, you're so boring now. You used to be fun. Now you're just this middle aged suburban dad who thinks watching Netflix is an adventure. I stood there processing. You're right. I am a middle aged Bourbon dad because I'm 35 with two kids in the suburbs. That's literally what I am. She rolled her eyes and left. Came back at 4 a. M. Slept through Thanksgiving morning, showed up looking like death while my mom made passive aggressive comments. Two weeks later, divorce papers. Already had them ready, already talked to a lawyer, already told her yoga friends. Everyone knew except me. I didn't fight it. I got the kids during the week. She got weekends. She got the house. But I kept paying half the mortgage. Sarah moved Tyler in two weeks after I moved out. The kids hated him immediately. The first three months were Instagram highlights of her new.

When I met Jessica, I was 24 and had just bought a small two bedroom apartment downtown. My uncle died and left me some money, so I paid cash for it. The mortgage was zero. But when Jessica moved in after 3 months of dating, I told her we were renting and I paid the landlord 15 a month. Why'd I lie? Because on our second date, I went on this rant about how she'd never marry a guy who wasted money on rent instead of building equity. She said renters were financially stupid and she needed a man who made smart investments. So when she asked to move in, I panicked and just said I rented the place. The lie snowballed. Every month I'd write a fake check to a fake landlord named Bill Patterson. I even made up stories about Bill raising the rent or being annoying about repairs. Jessica would get mad at this imaginary guy while I nodded along. We got married two years later. The whole time, she kept pushing me to buy property. She'd send me Zillow listings during work and make spreadsheets about down payments. I kept making excuses. Too expensive, bad timing, markets crazy. She started calling me lazy. Here's the thing, though, I was saving everything that fake rent money, it went straight into investment accounts. A year four of our marriage, I had built up over $60,000 just from the Money she thought was going to Bill Patterson. Then Jessica changed. She got a promotion at her job and started staying out late. She'd come home at midnight smelling like Cologne that wasn't mine. Her phone was always face down. She started picking fights about stupid stuff, like how I loaded the dishwasher or folded towels. One night I came home early from a work trip. There was a guy's jacket on our couch. Size large, I wear medium. I checked our bedroom and found a whole drawer of men's clothes that weren't mine. She'd been letting someone else live in my apartment. I didn't say anything. I just started documenting everything. Photos of the clothes, screenshots of her location, being at hotels when she said she was working late, credit card statements showing dinner for two at expensive restaurants. Two months later, Jessica sat me down and said she wanted a divorce. She'd met someone else named Tre.

My heart races in my chest as I stare at the Snapchat that my best friend Levi just sent me. Why would I need my gun and a shovel? What trouble has he gotten into this time? I immediately shoot him. A response, why? What's going on? It says that he opened it, but he doesn't respond. I frown. What is he doing? I roll out of bed and dress in black sweats and a black hoodie. Then I punch in the code to my gun safe and slide my pistol into the holster attached to the belt around my waist. Having my wallet, keys and a shovel from the shed in the backyard, I jump into my car and follow his GPS location on Snapchat. All the worst scenarios leap into my head. Did Levi kill someone and need my help burying a dead body? Maybe he got caught up on a drug deal or maybe he's in the middle of nowhere facing down a wild animal. What if he's facing off against a group of guys who want his money? What if I was too late and he was dead when I got there? What would I tell his wife and kids? I had to hurry. I drive for some time until I reach the side of a pretty empty road except for the occasional car I park on the shoulder. Of the road behind his Jeep and spot him digging up a hole a few feet away. I leap out of my car and hurry toward him, spotting a rolled up carpet next to him. And is that blood spilling out of one end of the carpet? My blood runs cold when I see that and I slow down as I get closer. Levi, I ask. His head jerks up in a panic and a flush works up his neck to his cheeks. It isn't what it looks like, he says quickly. I stare at him in shock. It looks like you need my help to bury a dead body, I retort. What is going on? He sighs. Can you help me dig a hole for the carpet? I need to get home to my family before my wife finds out about this. I shake my head. I'm not helping you bury a body, I hiss. Who is that? He opens his mouth to respond when bright lights suddenly turn on, blinding us. Hands up, someone yells over a bullhorn. Hands up! And everyone on the ground slowly.

She kicked me out saying find somewhere else to live or die. I don't care. You're useless now. Days later, the lawyer laughed. Did you even read the will? My wife went pale because the will said, when my father in law, Richard Hayes, died, I thought grief might finally humble my wife, Clarissa. Instead, it made her cruel. Richard was old school, built the business empire from scratch, worth over $33 million, plus a mansion on the hill that looked like something from a magazine. I sat by his bedside during his last months, feeding him soup, listening to his stories while Clarissa was too stressed to visit. When he passed, she didn't cry. She opened champagne. At the reading of the will, Clarissa wore a black designer dress that probably cost more than my car. She crossed her legs, smirked and waited for her name to be called. When the lawyer announced that she'd inherited everything, she didn't blink. She just said, well, it's about time. That night she looked me dead in the eye and said, you know what, Darren, you can leave now. I don't need you anymore. I thought she was joking. She wasn't. Three days later, I came home from work to find my things in garbage bags by the front door. What's going on, I asked. She didn't even look up from her phone. Find somewhere else to live or die. I Don't care. You're useless now. I just stood there, 7 years of marriage erased in a sentence. When I didn't move, she rolled her eyes. Don't make this dramatic. I'll Venmo you for gas. She handed me my car keys like she was tossing scraps to a stray. I left. No yelling, no begging, just violence. I drove to the Sunset Motel, $49 a night, flickering neon sign that said Sue a mole instead of sunset. The carpet smelled like mold and bad visions. I sat on the bed staring at the water stained ceiling and thought Richard would never have wanted this. That's when it hit me. Richard planned everything. The man had color coded files for his sock drawer. Would he really hand $33 million to a daughter who couldn't even pay her own credit card Bill without crying? I remembered something he'd said six months before he died. We were watching an old war movie together when he turned to me and said, you're a good man, Darren. Better than this fan.

He looks at them for a moment. Please wait, sir. He moves to his cruiser. I wasn't thinking of anything. I was more concerned about getting this divorce finalized and move on with my life. Sir, please step out of the car. I raise an eyebrow, but do his instruction quick as a viper. I was handcuffed and being told my rights. What am I being arrested for? I demand to know. For forgery.

I didn't even understand why they thought I had forged anything when I already find it difficult to forge even my signature. The door finally opens to a middle aged detective holding a thick folder. My name is Detective Waters. Mister Black. Please just call me Quinn. I cut in. Mister Quinn, then do you know why you are here? The detective asks as he places the folder on the table and takes a seat. Forgery, the officer previously told me. Mister Waters nods at my words, yes, but I've never forged anything in my life except For my parents signatures to go to camps and school affairs. But that was over 20 years ago. The detective just stares at me. You can have a lawyer here, the detective advises. I didn't do anything, so why would I need my lawyer? I ask in genuine confusion. The detective starts placing photos of me, signatures that I have signed and it matching to a cold case about a missing child. I gaped at the evidence. I'm going to be sick. There's plenty of floor. The active shrugs. Do you recognize the child? I stare at the photo. Isn't that my wife's child? I feel a gut feeling. Is she blaming me? I asked. What do you think?

He said he didn't want a wife who didn't work. John handed me divorce papers at breakfast. I need someone ambitious, he said, not even looking at his phone, not a housewife playing with crayons all day. My crayons were prismacolor pencils worth $400 a set. But I just smiled and signed every page. I've been publishing children's books under a pen name for six years. SL Anderson. Last year alone, I made $200,000 in royalties, with another $300,000 from a Netflix animation deal that was about to close. John had no idea because he never asked about my little hobby. He moved in with Emily two weeks after the divorce finalized. Emily was my college roommate who always envied everything I had. My apartment, my car, my husband. Now she had two out of three. They bought my old house. John never changed the locks, and I still had my key. But I wasn't petty enough to use it. I didn't need to be. I moved into a penthouse downtown with Florida ceiling windows and got back to work on my seventh book. Three months passed quietly. Then I got a text from John at 6:00am on a Saturday. Can you watch Emma today? Emily has a spa appointment and I have to work. Please. His six year old daughter from his first marriage. She wanted me to babysit on my weekend off. The audacity was Almost impressive. I said yes. Anyway, Emma was innocent and all this, and honestly, I'd always liked her. She arrived Saturday morning with her backpack covered in unicorn stickers. We made chocolate chip pancakes, and she pulled out a book from her bag. My latest one. The one that had just hit No. 1 on the New York Times best seller list two weeks ago. Aunt Sarah, look. Did you know this author? She has your exact last name. I tried to keep a straight face. That's my pen name, sweetie. Her job I literally dropped. Wait, you're SL Anderson? The SL Anderson? Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Mom talks about you all the time. She says you're the biggest children's author right now and she wishes I knew you so she could get signed copies. I had to bite my lip to keep from laughing. Does she? Yeah. She bought, like, all five of your books last month. She keeps them on the coffee table and tells everyone who visits that she's obsessed with SL Anderson. She even has a photo she printed out from your book tour on the fridge. This was getting better by the second. That evening, Emma went home and apparently told them everything. Every single detail. Monday morning, my doorbell rang at 7:00am. I opened it to find

I was loading groceries into my trunk when a woman started screaming at me from across the parking lot. You stole my spot. You knew I was waiting for it. She marched over, her face bright red, pointing at my black Nissan Altima like I just committed a felony. Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about. I've been parked here for 20 minutes. She wasn't hearing it. Liar. You took my spot and now you're blocking me in and look what you did to my car. She pointed at a BMW parked three spaces away. I squinted at it. There was a long scratch down the driver's side door. I didn't touch your car. I've been inside shopping. Don't lie to me. I saw you. You keyed my BMW because I called you out. People were starting to stare. She pulled out her phone and started filming me. I'm calling the police. You're not leaving until they get here. I have you on camera vandalizing my property. I looked around, confused. Her BMW was nowhere near my car. We weren't even in the same row. But she was standing behind my car now, arms crossed, physically blocking me from backing out. Let me back up and explain how I even ended up in this situation. I driven to the mall on a Saturday afternoon to grab some birthday gifts, found a decent spot. In the middle section, not too far from the entrance. Normal day, parked. Went inside, did my shopping. Nothing unusual except apparently this woman had been watching me. When I came back out with my bags, she was already lurking near my car. I didn't think much of it at first. Lots of people walk through parking lots. But as I was loading my trunk, I noticed her staring. Then she started speed walking toward me and that's when the yelling began. Now she was on the phone with 9 1 1, giving them a dramatic play by play. Yes, I need police immediately. I'm at Westfield Mall. A woman vandalized my vehicle and she's trying to flee the scene. Black Nissan Altima, license plate. She rattled off my plate number like she'd memorized it. She's aggressive and refusing to cooperate. I need someone here now. I just stood there holding my grocery bags, completely baffled. Other shoppers slowed down to watch the show. A couple of people pulled out their phones to record. Great. I was about to go viral for something I didn't do. Look, I didn't touch your car. I tried again. I don't even know you. Stop lying. You're criminal and you're going to pay for the damage. Ten minutes passed. She refused to move from behind my car. Every time I tried to reason with her, she just yell louder. Finally, a police cruiser pulled it to the lot. Lights flashing. The woman's face lit. Up like she climax. Finally, officer arrest this woman. She vandalized my car and tried to leave the scene. Two officers got out and the taller one looked immediately exhausted. Ma'am, we got a call about vandalism. Yes, this woman keyed my BMW. She dragged them to her car three rows away, pointing at the scratch. She did this because I caught her stealing my parking.

It was far from an ordinary confrontation. It was a public ritual of power transition. When Dutton solemnly ordered Casey to take over the ranch, rip, a man who had devoted half his life to the Dutton family, stepped forward without hesitation. He willingly became a stepping stone for Casey to establish authority, winning him the respect that every person on the ranch had to offer. Ain't no fighting on this ranch. If you wanna fight, you come find me. This clash not only allowed case to truly stand his ground, but also etched rips near absolute loyalty even deeper into the legacy of yellow. After the incident, Dutton found rip and expressed his gratitude in his characteristically firm and unquestionable manner. We made him earn it. Thank you. However, when Beth heard the news, it sparked a tense misunderstanding. She believed rip would choose to leave because of it. She urgently sought him out, on the verge of losing control, emotionally pleading desperately for him to stay. She even brought up memories of their distant first encounter, hoping to rekindle those decisive moments. This is my family, whether you all think of me that way or not. Yet Rip's response took her completely by surprise.

Because they were going to be in a fashion show in two days, they looked out of place compared to the other girls. After everyone left, Anna and Maya spotted Heather's thong in her bag. Oh, my god! Anna couldn't help but want to try it on, saying she felt incredibly sexy. Maya, seeing this, wanted to try it on, too. As they were shoving each other, Becca suddenly walked in. Fortunately, they hid in time and escaped unnoticed. Back home, Maya took out the thong and looked at it as if she were gazing at some symbol of sex appeal. She even slipped it over her head, lost in her own self admiration. The next day, she arrived at school wearing her thong, walking with a confident stride. For a moment, she felt like a queen. Anna, witnessing this, urged Maya to return it. But the next moment, Alex, look it! Anna demanded the thong back. Maya refused. Give me the. Give me the thing. But Anna eventually put it on and immediately felt a sense of confidence and sexiness. Let's make love. I do it all the time. But before the show, Heather discovered her thong was missing. When she confronted everyone, everyone denied it. Then Becca stepped forward and claimed Anna and Maya had stolen it. They both vehemently denied. It was time for the show. As Anna was about to walk onto the stage, Becca suddenly yanked her pants off, but Maya's underwear was still on her. Anna quickly confronted Maya and asked her to remove it, but Maya refused. During the struggle, the thong was torn. No! No!

After walking for who knows how long, the two still couldn't find an exit. Teammate Nino once again had thoughts of giving up. He wanted to go alone to search for a chance of survival. The two of them got into an argument about this issue. You don't get it. We're already dead. Hearing Mino say this, Thomas immediately fell into deep thought. At this moment, he walked forward and saw vines on the wall. An idea of how to help his teammate suddenly came to his mind. Using the vines to pull his teammate to the highest point would save their life. The sky was approaching evening. Monster roars could already be heard from the corners. Sorry, green. What? Green? At the last moment, Mino completely abandoned the two of them. Suddenly, he crawled into a cave below. At this moment, he didn't dare to breathe. Monster passed right in front of him. Only after the monster left did he slowly poke his head out. Finally, he secured his teammate firmly, but the sound he made attracted the Monster back. Thomas hurried. He looked for nearby cover. But when Thomas turned back around, the monster had already disappeared. In a daze, Thomas stepped on the monster's secreted slime. At this moment, the monster had quietly crawled above his head. Wow. Faced with a desperate situation, Thomas burst forth with tremendous strength. Come on, Thomas. Don't look back. Thomas. Early the next morning, the maze reopened. Seeing no one ahead, the teammates held no hope for their survival, told each other not coming back. They were all prepared to leave. But at this moment, Thomas and two others walked side by side. They gained new freedom at this moment.

Because last night, I burned my three children alive. Two officers sat across from me. They took notes while gently asking me to recall what happened last night. I was drinking at home with my friends. It got pretty late. My wife got upset. She said the kids needed to sleep and told everyone to leave. But I didn't want the night to end. After they left, I finished the rest of the booze alone, then tossed a few more logs into the fireplace and stepped out to buy more alcohol. I forgot to close the fire screen, but I brushed it off, told myself it'd be fine. When I came back home, I froze. The whole house was on fire. I couldn't get inside. I stood there helpless. The firefighters pulled out two black bags. Inside were my daughter's remains. Here my wife screamed until she passed out. They had to take her away in an ambulance. They said it wasn't a crime. They spoke softly, even got me a ride home. But that kindness only made the pain worse. So when one officer passed by, I grabbed his gun, put it to my head without a second thought. But the chamber was empty. I panicked and tried to unlock the safety. They tackled me to the ground. That fire destroyed my home. In my marriage. I left Manchester, a city filled with pain and memories, moved to Boston and lived Alone. I worked all kinds of jobs, never complained. But no one ever thanked me. I always looked like a corpse. Like I wasn't even alive. Then one day I got a call from Manchester. They said my brother had a heart attack. It was bad. I drove like a madman to get there. But I was too late. By the time I reached the hospital, he was already gone. The funeral was huge. My nephew stood up front. He greeted every guest. So young, but calm and steady. Like a grown man. In that moment, he became the backbone of the family. Him and me. I felt like I didn't belong. I stood in a corner, lost. When people came to offer condolences, I just nodded, said nothing. My ex wife showed up with her new husband.

Every time she came back from the supermarket, she would recite a flawless ad script like she had rehearsed it 100 times. Even when she made me a cup of hot chocolate. Why don't you let me fix you some of this new mo Coco drink? All natural cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua, no artificial sweeteners. I looked at her completely confused. I asked what she was doing, but she pretended not to hear me and kept praising those products with a smile. This is the best. What the hell does this have to do with anything? Tell me what's happening. That moment, my patience finally ran out. I yelled at her in anger. Dice me, slice me up. So many choices. No, do something. She suddenly looked up and screamed for help toward the ceiling. I realized something huge was hiding behind all this. She tried to run. I chased after her, wanting to know the truth. Then came a knock on the door. Reyman. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. It was my best friend dropping by for a beer. We sat by the bridge. I told him I felt like the whole world revolved around me. He paused for a moment, then quickly changed the subject, talking about our childhood. He even raised his hand, swearing he would never lie to me. The point is, I would gladly step in front of Traffic for you. True. The last thing I'd ever do is lie to you. The last thing that I would ever do. He's lying to me. I believed him. I always trust too easily. But coincidences kept piling up and I started to doubt everything around me. One day I just wanted to feel the ocean breeze. Suddenly, it started to rain. No matter where I went, the rain followed me. Fear started to crawl in ladder. I looked at our wedding photo and noticed something strange. My wife's fingers were tightly crossed, the gesture for seeking forgiveness. It meant our marriage was a lie. I didn't confront her. I wanted to see what she was hiding. That day, she finished another ad and said she had an emergency surgery at the hospital. As she walked out, I gently tapped her shoulder. She froze, then smiled that same fake smile and hurried away. I followed her to the hospital where she worked. As soon as I entered, a nurse stopped me like I was an intruder. I smiled, said I just had a message for my wife, then pretended to leave, but quietly followed her instead. In the hallway, a man in a wheelchair rushed toward me. I stepped aside only to be blocked by a nurse pushing a cart. My heart was pounding. I shoved the cart away and ran into the operating room. But what I saw inside was the worst act I'd ever seen.

He untied the rope from his dog, Bella. Bella thought her owner was setting her free and looked reluctant to leave. She had no idea she was just being switched to an iron chain. The other end was tied to her owner. It wasn't until three days later that Bella realized her owner had died and wanted her to be buried with him. We finished the last of the food. Thirsty Bella could see clean river water right in front of her. She tried many times but couldn't break free from the iron chain. I was so thirsty. I needed water. Finally, she could only lie on the ground and wait. Bella hadn't had water for several days. Soon she was lying on the ground, barely alive. When she was about to die of thirst, she remembered her childhood. She hadn't seen her mother since she was taken away. Young Bella was raised by a mother cat. Fortunately, two young people often fed them. Watching their backs as they left, the dog bravely chased after them. What are you doing here, baby? She was playful and lively. Lucas, who already loved small animals, decided to take her home and named her Bella. Bella. Bella love to borrow into her owner's arms and cling to him. Her owner would play all kinds of games with her. We played get the ball, stop. We played stop, stop. We played don't you shoes, Bella, don't you shoot under her. Owner's care, Bella gradually grew up. Mom often took Bella to the nursing home where she worked. It was full of injured war veterans. Bella could feel their sadness. Whenever this happened, she would burrow into their arms to comfort them. Bella's companionship made them no longer sad. Drew took me on rides in his small car. Steve had really delicious things. At first, everything went smoothly until this day. Bella suddenly spotted a squirrel outside the window. She chased after it. When Lucas found her, they were spotted by animal control officers pounding that animal. Bella, go home, go home, please, but you need me. Finally, she was caught around the neck by the man. Come get me, Bella. I'm sorry I didn't do. Go home, Lucas. I'm not that gonna hurt you. Watching her owner's figure gradually fade away, Bella locked in the cage was very sad. Fortunately, Lucas paid bail the next day to rescue her. They had no choice but to temporarily leave her with uncle in the countryside. They would bring her home after settling everything. Watching her owner's figure fade away again, Bella let out a sad whimper. Uncle in the countryside was also good to her, but Bella missed Lucas. She decided to go find her owner. Bella climbed up the slide when uncle wasn't paying attention and jumped out of the yard. She crossed a field and went through a small town, beginning this 400 kilometer journey home. But unexpectedly, Lucas had Already arranged everything and was on his way to pick her up. Unfortunately, they just missed each other at a turn. And so Bella embarked on a long two year journey home. This day, Bella came to town looking for food. Following the scent, she came to a supermarket. Bella rushed inside. Hey, hey, hey, stop that door. Hé food on the floor is always for the dog. Chicken, chicken, chicken. Bella enjoyed her food by the roadside. Then a homeless man handed her a bowl of water. While she was drinking, the homeless man forcibly dragged her over so she was tied up there and became the homeless man's begging tool. Many passers by were attracted by the dog and gave a lot of money. Bella never forgot Lucas, so this day she tried to bite through the rope and escape, but she was discovered by the homeless man. The homeless man took out an iron chain and tied Bella to himself because he knew he was going to die. A few days later, Bella felt thirsty and wanted to drink water, but the chain wasn't long enough and she couldn't break free just like that. After who knows how many days, Bella was lying by the lake barely alive. She thought of Lucas again. Go home, Bella. Go home. Fortunately, two cycling boys discovered her. It's stuck. Ah, what is it? There's a body over there. No way. The dog's chained to it. Is he dead? I think So what are you gonna do? And freed her from the chain. After being freed, Bella rushed straight to the lake water. Water never tasted so good. Bella set out on the road home again. But facing the fast traffic, Bella didn't know what to do for a moment. Anxious to get home, she prepared to risk crossing the road when she came to her senses, one leg was already broken, but Bella still stubbornly stood up, then limped toward home. After 700 days and nights, she finally returned to the home she had been longing for. But when Bella excitedly knocked on the door, a stranger's face opened the door. It turned out Lucas had already moved away. At this moment, she collapsed powerlessly to the ground. Bella desperately closed her eyes, but just then, a cat's meow came. It was the mother cat who had adopted her as a child. The mother cat came forward to comfort her. But then animal control officers came to the door again. Bella saw the situation was bad, quickly jumped out the window and escaped. There is just one more place to look for Lucas. She came to the veterans nursing home. When Bella appeared at the door, those old soldiers recognized her at once. They all looked at Bella in disbelief. Bella also excitedly rushed toward them. Then Bella suddenly sensed something. She turned around when she saw her owner, Lucas. Lucas, it can't be Bella. She limped toward her owner. And Lucas also shed tears. After more than 700 days, over 400 kilometers, Bella was finally back in her owner's arms. Lucas, Lucas! Lucas! Bella, you're alive. I did go home.

Every day he followed the same routine wake up in the morning, have breakfast, and then set out to beautify and take care of the earth. One morning, as he began his breakfast, his eyes fell on the calendar and he suddenly remembered that today god himself was going to come and inspect his work. Thinking this, he immediately picked up his toolbox filled with tools and got to work. First, he took a hammer and chisel and carved a tall mountain to make it look even more beautiful. Then he sprinkled water over Mount Everest, making it look fresh and radiant. After that, he headed toward a dense forest and used a sickle to clear away unnecessary bushes, leaving the forest clean and tidy. Finally, he reached Lake Victoria and started pouring water into it, slowly and carefully. While he was doing all this, some tribal people gathered below. It was their first time seeing such a gigantic man. Due to his enormous height, they misunderstood his actions and thought he was urinating into the lake. This made them angry, but when the man smiled and explained to them that he was a servant of god and was working to beautify the earth, they understood everything. They began to respect him, bowing their heads in awe. In this way, a misunderstanding turned into deep respect, all through kindness and patient explanation.

Jack suggested they could arrange a transfer to another hospital. I want, he said, I could do it. I want Doctor Sean. Liam's condition suddenly got worse.

First, prepare the tools, then use a hammer to knock out the teeth. Mark the incision points with a pen. Use a scalpel to sever the leg tendons and bones. Accidents inevitably occur during a process. Without anesthesia. Some bleed to death. With one less person, I can only make an 11 person centipede. I devised a solution using a pneumatic nail gun to connect their buttocks to their mouths. After a period of time, I completed an exceptional masterpiece. I danced with childlike joy. Later, I found a basin and poured food inside. But the woman before me slammed the basin aside. At that moment, I descended into utter madness. I forced the food into her mouth. That wasn't enough. To test the experiment's success, I administered laxatives injected into their bodies. Before long, their insides churned violently. Seeing my creation succeed, I burst into laughter. They looked like my own children. After the experiment succeeded, I killed them in an instant. I returned to the basement. It was all just my fantasy. Now I still fret over my prey, staring at the surveillance room every day. Finally, a family of three appeared before my eyes. I grabbed my pistol, waiting for my prey to draw nearer, step by step.

But just when things were getting serious, the boy fell asleep. That instantly ticked her off. To shake off her frustration, Anna went back to the party and joined a game with her classmates. At first, the vibe was fun and relaxed. But when the bottle stopped and pointed at the shy guy, Jack, everyone couldn't help but smile. According to the rules, Jack chose truth. Anna then tore a small piece from a newspaper, pretended it was a love letter, and asked Jack who he'd want to give it to. No one expected it, but despite being quiet and reserved, Jack didn't hesitate. He handed the paper straight to the school beauty. The problem was, she already had a boyfriend and he was right there. Jack's move instantly set him off and he publicly humiliated Jack. The game ended awkwardly and Jack disappeared. After that, he didn't show up again, not even at graduation. Months later, several classmates who had played that night suddenly received birthday invitations from Jack. At first, none of them wanted to go, but after hearing about Jack's wealthy family background, they decided to check it out. Before long, they all arrived at the destination.

But he has an unbelievable quirk. He likes to use his X ray vision to spy on his female boss. However, these are just surface details. The truly terrifying thing is the darkness Homelander hides behind. When a criminal commits vicious acts, Queen Nave doesn't hesitate to take him down, ready to hand him over to the police. But because Homelander's approval rating dropped by 1%. He instead takes his anger out on the criminal. Soon, the criminal's body is completely pierced by Homelander. Queen Maeve is furious about this violence, but she doesn't dare speak out. To cover up the truth, homelander deliberately creates the illusion of self defense. You know the drill. He shot at us first. Next, Homelander is dispatched on an emergency mission. A passenger plane has been hijacked midair. The lives of everyone on board are under threat. Soon, Homelander arrives, easily taking out the hijackers with his heat vision. And the passengers cheer for him. However, he isn't just there to save people. More importantly, he's there to boost his public image. Right then, Queen Maeve notices something wrong. She gets no response from the pilots. It turns out there is one more hijacker in the cockpit. He holds a gun to the pilot's head. There you go. Just relax. But the next second, the hijacker kills the pilot. Homelander acts immediately, blasting the hijacker with his heat vision. But The force is too strong, and the control panel is destroyed. He's dead. Can you fly a plane? The plane is clearly going to crash, but Homeland remains calm. He even comforts the passengers, telling them the danger will be over soon. Wait, are you leaving us? No, no, I'm just seeing something down the back. However, right after calming the passengers, Homeland forcefully tears the hatch open, hastening the death of everyone inside. Cause he knows this plane is beyond saving. It's better to let the passengers die quickly. Queen May begs Homelander to at least save two children, but he refuses. Because Homelander knows that if there are any survivors, the world will learn the truth about the crash. His approval ratings would plummet, and he absolutely cannot allow that to happen. Stay back! You stay the fuck back or I'll laser you! God damn it! Miserable fucking one of you! Completely disregarding his heroic image, Homelander quickly pulls Queen Maeve away. Queen Maeve has no choice but to leave the children behind and escape the plane with Homelander. They watch helplessly as the plane plummets downward. Eventually, the wreckage of the plane is found in the ocean. Homlander appears on the scene again, but not for rescue. He is there to protect his image. He even seizes the opportunity to blame the entire incident on the NSA, claiming that if he had received the Intel sooner, the passengers would not have met such a Tragic fate. Surrounding crowd believes his lies, even chanting his name. But Queen Maeve is completely disillusioned with Homelander. Only she knows the truth and has fully seen his most terrifying side.

Linda kicked the criminal to man dead, the criminal directly sending him tumbling down. The criminal's leg was instantly fractured from the fall, but this didn't scare them away. Instead, the criminals were completely enraged. They brought the injured man back to their camp and gave him painkillers. However, fearing exposure, they chose not to call the police for help, but instead brought climbing equipment to catch Linda. Meanwhile, Linda didn't dare stop for a moment because she knew the criminals wouldn't easily let her go. She put on professional climbing shoes and applied anti slip powder to her hands. She thought that if she could just climb to the top, she could escape these criminals. Little did she know, three criminals had already taken a detour and reached above her. Although they couldn't see Linda figure, they had already guessed that Linda was beneath the rocks. Fortunately, Linda also heard the criminals talking from overhead. Linda instantly felt utterly desperate. At this moment, the criminals above lowered a rope. They claimed they would spare Linda life, but Linda knew these criminals Were deceiving her. She wouldn't fall for it at all. So Linda hung a piece of paper on the rope. When they pulled the rope up, they discovered the paper had a greeting written on it. Well, if this is the way you wanted. Hearing the criminal's angry voices, Linda smiled smugly. Next, she began observing outing. Soon she spotted a tent nearby. She fixed a carabiner in the gap overhead, then hung up the tent.

Before she could react, the backpack came crashing toward her. Again. Linda could only hold tightly onto the backpack. The criminal saw the rope go taut and realized the opportunity had come. A man immediately used a knife to cut the rope in the critical moment. Fortunately, Linda grabbed onto a nearby rock. Looking at the bottomless cliff below, she felt a wave of fear. Linda used all her strength to climb back onto the large rock. She finally experienced the feeling of escaping death. But Linda crisis wasn't over. Because of this, just as Linda was sleeping at night, a sharp knife suddenly pierced through from outside.

People here judge a person's good or evil through likes. For example, when an old grandma gives a little girl an ice cream, she earns a like. But if someone accidentally does something wrong, they receive negative reviews. And those with over 500,000 negative reviews can never enter any entertainment venues. If negative reviews exceed 10 million, they'll be forcibly taken to the operating table. The emotions in their brains will be completely formatted. And at that point, all human feelings and desires will vanish. So on this planet, likes have become the sole standard for measuring a person's worth. When when Earthling Kelly and her group arrived on this planet, they knew nothing about the rules. Here, the mischievous John started dancing in front of a statue. People on the street all held up their phones to record. But he hadn't realised he'd gotten himself into big trouble. After entering the restaurant, the front desk clerk was shocked to see the negative reviews on John's badge skyrocketing. Oh my god, what did you do? At that moment, the TV was showing the video of John dancing in front of the statue. Because he desecrated a historical great. The negative reviews on his badge had already exceeded 500,000. Clerk told them to leave quickly, saying they weren't welcome. But just after walking out of the restaurant, they were stopped by people on the street. John was tightly surrounded and by Then the negative reviews on his badge had exceeded one million. Finally, the police took him away, and at the police station, lawyer found John and told him if John's negative reviews stayed below 10 million, he could be released. If they exceeded that, his brain would be forcibly formatted, turning him into a vegetable completely. John was completely panicked at this moment. What could he do at this point, voting on various platforms began and negative reviews soared quickly reaching 4 million. Gradually, the negative reviews on the badge rose to 9 million, glaringly obvious. Only 1 million more and John's brain would undergo torture. The lawyer knew there was no hope, because according to his experience, no one could escape brain punishment with 9 million negative reviews. By this time, John had been taken to the execution platform and the police tied him up. Kelly called the captain to quickly find a way, while the engineer hacked into the review system, trying to create a miracle for John. They first made up a story about John taking care of his 90 year old grandma, then created a photo of him as a child, hoping to win everyone's sympathy. Now the audience was sharing this information everywhere, and John was extremely flustered. At this moment, everyone held up their phones to vote, and negative reviews were about to reach 10 million. Based on everyone's psychology, the engineer created another video of John being a Special Forces soldier with his beloved dog appearing in the video, When the public saw this information, most felt pity, and both positive and negative reviews grew wildly. Everyone held their breath. Once it exceeded 10 million, the machine would automatically execute the torture. Finally, the negative reviews stopped rising and the voting ended.

Once the fisherman pulled it out, it quickly ended up in the seafood market. There, a sharp eyed five star chef noticed its strong body, paid a high price, and brought it back to his kitchen, ready to prepare it for a lavish dinner. But when the chef tried to cut it open as usual, something unexpected happened. The lobster's abdomen began secreting a white, sticky fluid. Curious, the chef flipped its body over, only for the lobster to suddenly spray the liquid directly onto his face. He hurried to wipe it off with a towel, then told an intern to deal with the lobster in turn. Unsure what to do, decided to throw it into the grinder. After it was shredded and dumped into the drain, the same white fluid splashed onto him as well. Meanwhile, the head chef started arranging the plates, but his vision grew blurry and his hands began trembling uncontrollably. He he tried stepping outside for fresh air, but his breathing became harder and harder. Moments later, he collapsed, coughing up black blood and died on the spot. The sous chef soon met the same fate. After wiping down the cutting board that had the strange fluid on it, he developed identical symptoms. Even though he was rushed to the hospital, the doctors failed to save him. Soon, more restaurant staff fell ill, all showing the same horrifying sign Doctors collected samples of the black blood from the victims. They pricked their own fingers and mixed their blood under a microscope, only to witness something terrifying. Blood cells were being devoured at a speed visible to the naked eye by an unknown virus. This meant a brand new deadly virus had been discovered. The investigation revealed that every infected worker had been in contact with the lobster. When asked how the lobster was disposed of, the restaurant owner admitted it had been thrown into the drain. The doctor was horrified, realizing the ground lobster had flowed into the sewer system. That meant the virus could already be spreading into the city's water supply. As expected, more and more patients flooded into the hospital. With the city's population reaching 20 million, the consequences of contaminated water were unimaginable. But the nightmare didn't stop there. It wasn't just the lobster attacking humans. Schools of fish began surrounding fishermen underwater, trapping them until they suffocated. Even whales, usually peaceful, started ramming ships with full force, splitting vessels apart and killing countless people. Orcas were even more brutal, tearing humans apart in the water as if determined to wipe them out. When researchers dissected a dead whale, they found an unknown liquid in its brainstem. And that liquid was identical to what had been inside the infected lobster. At this point, one researcher had a disturbing thought. It seemed as if the creatures of the ocean were consciously seeking revenge on humanity.

It'll take the police at least an hour to get there. Upon hearing this, Anna is instantly overwhelmed by despair and helplessness. She calls the specialist in charge of the home security system.

Luckily, following the experienced specialist instructions, Anna quickly wakes her sleeping son, planning to find a hidden spot to hide. With a loud explosion, the door is blown open. Security personnel shout for Anna to hide. Thankfully, neither mother nor son is hurt. Anna yanks her son under a table to hide, just as the robbers walk in. They swear they're only here to steal money, not to hurt anyone. But you can never trust a robber's words. Then security guides them by the cameras, and the pair uses quick moves to sneak past the robbers line of sight and down to the billiards room. But the robbers are ready.

Just as he walked away, a passing taxi splashed water, knocking the pencil down and catching the attention of an old man drinking coffee nearby. As the old man stood up to pick it up, a young man on a bike rode by and couldn't break in time, hitting the old man and crashing into a nearby fruit stand. A homeless man rushed to grab the fallen fruit, but the vendor tried to stop him and chaos broke out among the group. At that moment, a bus driver passing by looked over out of curiosity and didn't notice the light had turned red. A normal woman crossing the street was sent flying on the spot. It looked like an ordinary accident, but anyone who's killed before knows that this is a top notch crime. When the target appeared, Jack started analyzing the environment, calculating the possibilities for different accidents. Traffic lights, buses, the coffee drinking old man and a puddle on the road, all seemingly unrelated, but with the right variables could turn the impossible into reality. The police arrived quickly. After questioning witnesses and inspecting the scene, they concluded it was just an accident. But then a pencil on the ground caught their attention. A similar pencil had been found at the scene of another recent accident. Could there be a connection? Were both incidents triggered by a pencil? A colleague insisted the odds were basically zero, that Intersection had countless people and vehicles with too many variables and unpredictable reactions to coordinate. If it was man made, the person must have had a godlike perspective. Just then, another bus accident was reported and everyone rushed to the scene. But this time there were no fatalities. They questioned all the passengers. None had seen a pencil. Apparently, they were too nervous. It's normal for traffic accidents to occur in the city. But then that same familiar pencil slowly rolled out from under a car. Ellie suddenly felt something was wrong. If these incidents were connected, the plan might not be over yet. No one had died at this scene. Ellie looked around and noticed a man on the bridge acting suspiciously. He was intensely focused on something ahead. Following his gaze, Ellie saw a second accident happen. She immediately ran toward the overpass. Realizing he'd been spotted, Jack threw his bike off the bridge. But instead of fleeing, he waited calmly for the police. As they approached to arrest him, Jack's expression changed and he suddenly jumped off the bridge. It turns out that the bike was thrown down just to change the trajectory of the cars passing under the bridge. And just like that, with the police still confused, Jack escaped once again.

Those who cried the hardest were marked for special training. At age 5, they were forced to watch brutal battles between wild boars and hunting dogs. The bloody scenes were unbearable. But instructors used batons to force them to keep watching. By age 8, they had to pass complex intelligence tests. By age 12, they ran 100 kilometers of mountain terrain daily. If they finished last, they were executed on the spot. This hellish training lasted 17 years. Survivors had their name, ID number and blood type carved into their faces for future battlefield transfusions. They never speak there. Their only purpose is to kill. They are emotionless war machines with nothing but the cold gleam of slaughter in their eyes. Jack was the best among them. Wherever they went, no life was left behind. From earth to alien worlds, they conquered all. After taking this planet, the soldiers were on standby. By now, they were 40 years old. At that moment, their commander introduced a new generation of soldiers meant to replace them. He confidently touted the new soldiers advantages. The old ones were selected by gene screening, but the new ones were genetically modified. Stronger, faster and more durable. So the commander decided to replace the old soldiers with the new ones. But the captain refused, not out of sentiment, but because he believed the veterans combat experience was irreplaceable. As tensions rose, they agreed to settle. It through a series of contests. First was a shooting test. Despite rapid fire, the machine gun had no recoil and boosted a 99% accuracy rate. Still, the captain wasn't convinced. Next came the endurance challenge. And the captain shows his ace, Jack. To prove the new soldier's strength, the commander let the veteran start running 20 minutes ahead. Then he sent out his top recruit. Tom. Go 50 miles, 6:07 on a run about 60 minutes. Go on command, Tom launched into a full sprint. Soon he caught up with Jack and won by a large margin. Even more terrifying, Tom's breathing never changed. Next, they climbed chains side by side. The captain wanted a real fight. He wanted Jack to teach the new recruit a lesson.

He trembles as he pushes aside the broken stones. What appears before him are the lifeless bodies of his brother and sister. When he sees his brother lying on top of his sis, Tyrion is overcome with grief and tears begin to fall. At this moment, there are no words to express his sorrow. And Daenerys. She doesn't care about the lives of the millions in King's Landing. They all die, just like that. Then Tyrion walks over to Daenerys, disappointed beyond measure. He strips the title of hand of the king right in front of all the soldiers. Then he throws it down the steps. Seeing this, Daenerys commands her guards to seize him, ordering his execution. Watching Tyrion being taken away, John is filled with inner conflict. In the halls of the kingdom, Daenerys stands before what she has longed for her entire life the Iron Throne. Now it is finally hers. And through this war, she has come to realize that mercy does not conquer the world. Only violence can. At that moment, John approaches Daenerys. He knows the woman he loves has changed completely. As he pretends to kiss Daenerys to prevent another tyrant from rising, John suddenly draws a dagger and plunges it into Daenerys body. Unprepared, Daenerys, with an expression of disbelief, dies in John's arms. At that moment, Drogon senses something is wrong. He quickly nudges Daenerys body with his head, only to discover his Mother has been killed by John. Furious, Drogon turns his fiery gaze on the Iron Throne, and with a blast of dragonfire, he melts it into a pool of molten iron. Too many have been corrupted by the power it represents, losing their true selves. Drogon does not kill John because he senses the Targaryen blood running through his veins. Perhaps Daenerys was not the only one with dragon blood. John is also a descendant of House Targaryen. Finally, Drogon gently lifts his mother's body and flies away from this land, torn by the constant struggles for power into the unknown.

Suddenly, in the blink of an eye, the ocean water rapidly receded into the sea. Tourists rushed to the shore to see what was happening. As they stared at the bare seafloor, no one understood what was going on. Then a panic security guard sounded the alarm. A deafening Siren echoed across Santa Monica Beach. Tourists instantly began running. In a chaotic panic, Jack clutched his child and sprinted madly toward the edge of the amusement park. Behind them, a towering wave hundreds of meters high was about to swallow the entire beach. The passengers on the Ferris wheel were in despair and the operator was helplessly paralyzed. In a desperate moment, Jack placed his child inside a vending booth. Layer upon layer of raging waves roared like thousands of furious dragons, swallowing everything in their path. At the moment the waves came, Jack jumped in, but the tiny booth was no match for the wave's immense power. He was tossed around by the seawater until he grabbed hold of a power line and surface. By then, the amusement park was completely submerged. Jack anxiously looked around and finally spotted his child near a utility pole. He immediately swam toward him, but the current was so strong that he was swept away himself before he could swim to the child, he climbed onto the floating object to catch his breath, but the child couldn't hold on and was swept away by the waves. Without hesitation, Jack swam after him and pulled the child above the water. The two were washed up beside a fire truck. Jack quickly lifted the child onto the fire truck, then climbed up to the roof himself. But this was only the beginning. Another massive tsunami was fast approaching.

As long as she waters it 100,000 times, the stone will grant any wish. But her son Jack doesn't believe it. He grabs a crowbar and flips the stone over. This scares the villagers around them. The villagers quickly clasped their hands and prayed devoutly. To their surprise, Jack moved the rock under the waterfall. Then he told his mom that this way he could water the stone 50,000 times in one second. Soon, a magical scene occurred. A mask fell at Jack's feet. From that day on, he stared blankly at the mask every day. Until one day, he accidentally made an imprint of the mask's face. Jack slowly drew the appearance of the mask's owner, which gave him a feeling of attraction. So he quickly ran upstream toward the waterfall. As he ran upstream of the waterfall, he saw a fairy covered in colored butterflies. Jack gathered all his strength and leapt toward the fairy. But just as he grabbed the branch, the fairy vanished. He followed the fairy's directions and climbed up the waterfall against the current for three whole days and nights. In the end, Jack used the branch to make a bow and arrow, then leaped and shot the arrow. The long arrow pierced through a tree on the Mountain Top and got stuck there, allowing him to reach the peak. At that moment, the fairy appeared before him. As Jack reached out to touch her, she transformed into butterflies. And flew away. Jack searched the forest for the fairy's trace. Suddenly he heard a scream and quickly ran to check. A girl rushed out of the woods. Her running posture was quite graceful and Jack couldn't help but feel attracted. However, a group of soldiers chased after her, clearly intent on capturing her. The hero's moment had come, and Jack excitedly followed them. Just as the soldiers were about to catch the girl, she suddenly shouted a mysterious incantation. A long sword appeared out of nowhere in the air. In an instant, all the soldiers were killed. To capture the girl, Jack set a trap. He lured her in, and soon the girl fell into the trap. Jack happily walked over to check it out, only to feel a chill down his back. It turned out the girl had somehow hidden behind him and pressed the sword against his body. Jack had no choice but to make his big move, and lovely told the girl, I love you. Then he hugged her tightly and the two tumbled from the snowy mountains to the grasslands. The girl was so furious her lungs almost exploded. Only wanting to kill this rogue, Jack did a backflip, pulling the girl's sleeve, then spun around, removed her outer garment, tussled her long hair, and took her under a waterfall for a soak, crushing fruit to apply eyeliner and lipstick. The girl turned around and saw Jack holding her lost mask. She couldn't believe Jack Had really come from the bottom of the mountain for her. She was so touched that she hugged him tightly. But thinking about rescuing the princess, she took the opportunity to drug Jack and left alone. However, she he hadn't gotten far when an accident happened. A soldier suddenly threw a fishing net and successfully captured the girl. Just as they were about to harm her, Jack appeared in time. With the soldiers getting closer, Jack quickly pushed a large boulder to stop the pursuers. But what he didn't expect was that the impact from the boulder triggered a landslide. Jack hastily tore up a piece of bark and slid out with the girl. Just as the heavy snow was about to bury them alive, they reached a cliff. Jack immediately dashed toward it. They successfully escaped.

They forged work permits, sneaked aboard Jack's private jet, then drugged their drinks and served them to Jack and his guests. Unaware they drank and Soon passed out in their seats, the women rushed to the cargo hold, where they found numerous suitcases stuffed with gold. They quickly took three cases of gold and hit the plane's alarm button. Before Jack could react, the FBI arrived. Seeing the suitcases full of gold, the FBI immediately arrested Jack and his crew for gold smuggling. Meanwhile, the women began living a life of luxury.

Instinctively, he rubbed his eyes to ease the awkwardness. But the master, Jack, noticed the gesture and asked what he had just seen. David quickly made up a story, saying he had passed by a sacred tree and was showing respect. The couple, who had just returned from the United States, really believed him and imitated David's gesture of paying respect to an ordinary tree on the roadside. He managed to completely fool the two of them. After dropping them off at their destination, David drove the master's car back home. As he passed the village entrance, he honked repeatedly to attract everyone's attention. He wanted to return home in style, like someone who suddenly struck it rich. With everyone watching, he swaggered his way home, but his grandmother scolded him for not sending any money back for months. When David took out cash, her attitude changed instantly. She even made him a rare chicken dinner. Perhaps David's prolonged absence from home made grandma feel that he was out of her control. In order to completely tie David to make money for him, he has already found a good wife for him so that the two of them can get married after a while. But David knew that once he got married, he would lose his chance to escape the cage and end up like his father. He immediately made it clear that he would neither get married nor send Money home again. He also urged his brother to escape their grandmother's control, all she cared about was how much money her descendants could make. She didn't care if they lived or died. Even though David was loyal to Jack and his wife, one day the usually gentle mistress Ellie lost her temper in front of guests because his uniform was covered with grease and dust and his hands often scratched his private parts. And David's mouth smelled bad all day long, and his teeth were covered with yellow stains. When David brought her some coffee, Ellie made him pour it out without taking a sip. Afterward, he looked at his reflection in a plate and saw his yellow teeth. He smelled the stench from deep inside himself and resolved to make a change. Later, David went out and bought toothpaste and a decent set of clothes for himself. He tried to break lifelong bad habits back home. David began brushing his teeth furiously in front of the mirror. No matter how hard he scrubbed, until his mouth was raw, the stains wouldn't come off. Just, just like his lowly status, it couldn't be changed. From then on, David became even more devoted to Jack and Ellie, completely ignoring the divide between master and servant. That night, Jack and Ellie stayed out late partying at a bar, perhaps seeking some thrill. Ellie kicked David out of the car and took the driver's seat herself as a servant. David didn't. Dare refuse and let them fool around. Both of them were clearly tipsy, and Ellie drove faster and faster. David began to feel uneasy, but since it was already 2:00am, he didn't think much of it. Yet in the next second.

At first, she suspected she had misread it. But when she opened the other person's profile, she found all the information matched her husband exactly. But when she saw that the person was lying, claiming to be single and childless are. At that moment, Anna could no longer suppress her emotions. However, when she got home, she still prepared dinner for her family. As usual, she dared not directly question her husband about the account in front of him. Anna had to try hard to control her emotions. She didn't want her husband and children to notice something was wrong. After putting the kids to bed, she carefully tried to bring up the issue with her husband. However, her husband chose to keep it a secret from her. So Anna secretly registered an account. She planned to impersonate the type of woman her husband liked. To win him back, Anna picked a mysterious photo. She thought her husband wouldn't pay attention to her. But to her surprise, many people were deeply attracted to her mysterious photo. Even her husband took the initiative to start chatting with her. Anna knew that the first step of her plan had succeeded. They chatted for a long time. Jack thought she was the most understanding woman in the world. He couldn't help but complain to her that his wife after marriage was like a washing machine or Other household appliances just lacked any femininity. Basically, she had lost all the traits of a woman. After hearing her husband's true thoughts about her, Anna felt incredibly sad for her 16 years of sacrifice. She worked hard every day, taking on all the household chores. She carefully took care of him and their children. She didn't even have money to buy makeup. She couldn't even bring herself to buy a cheap skirt. But her husband thought she was particularly boring. He wouldn't even wait an extra two seconds to drive her to work. But in order not to reveal her true identity to Jack, Anna had to reluctantly agree with him. This made Jack increasingly think that the mysterious woman had fallen for him. Jack then suggested that they should meet in person. But at this point, Anna chose to leave. She didn't get a reply from the person she liked. This kept Jack awake all night. The next day, Anna decided not to accommodate her husband and kids anymore. She announced that from now on, anyone who wanted cereal for breakfast would have to pour it themselves, and after eating, they would have to wash their own bowls. After playing with their toys, the kids had to clean up and put them away. After hearing this, both kids had unhappy expressions, and Jack didn't understand why Anna was acting this way. The kids, angry, refused to eat and left. Anna, however, calmly said it was no big deal. She just believed the family needed to change. Helpless, Jack had no choice but to clean the dishes himself. But he had no idea where to start. He ended up stuffing all the plates into the dishwasher. After work, Anna went to the gym for the first time. She spent the money she normally used to buy gifts for Jack on hiring a personal trainer instead. Even so, Anna still loved Jack deeply. She still wanted to try and win Jack back. Anna tried to communicate with Jack, hoping to salvage their relationship. But her husband refused, citing work as the reason. Then Jack started chatting online. Anna had no choice but to continue pretending to be that mysterious woman. She didn't expect that this time her husband would confess his feelings to her. He even suggested taking her to Paris. This made Anna feel even more heartbroken about her 16 years of sacrifice. Jack had always promised to take her to Paris, but he had never truly fulfilled that promise. Unarraged, immediately put down her computer. She grabbed a kitchen knife and punctured all of his car tires. After finishing this, Anna still returned to Jack's side and went to bed with him.

Seeing Jack's dismissive attitude toward her, she finally decided to meet Jack as the mysterious woman. Even if that mysterious woman Was herself.

Two sales assistants quickly follow her, but they don't stop her. Instead, they help her by standing the meat upright to save space. She then separates from the sales assistance. She heads straight to the high end food section. She places all the caviar into her cart. Then she quickly pushes the cart to other sections. She picks up a lot of pizzas. The sales assistants also help her load up on many canned goods that last longer. Next, she hurries over to the fruit section. She grabs a lot of fruits. Seeing time passing quickly, she rushes to push her cart back to the starting point. And on the way, she fills her cart with candies. At the entrance, as the boss presses the timer, the woman excitedly hugs her children. It turns out this is a free shopping cart clearance event. She picks out the foods her kids love the most and successfully fills up the family fridge. The whole family is happy with this experience. Back home, Evelyn prepares a lavish steak dinner. The table is filled with the laughter of the children. At that moment, she feels like she has won. But Kelly, seeing the fridge full of food, has a harder and harder look on his face. His pride makes it hard for him to accept that his wife is more capable than him. So he starts throwing the food from the fridge onto the Floor in a sarcastic tone, as if doing so would hide Evelyn's brilliance. Kelly would rather eat cold canned food than try a bite of the food Evelyn carefully prepared. Evelyn ignores her husband's displeasure. Clearly, this isn't the first time she happily enjoys the meal with her kids, but her husband seeing this scene feels even worse. For the sake of providing a harmonious family environment for the kids, Evelyn still tries to take care of Kelly's emotions. She prepares what he likes for him. She also tries to comfort Kelly with the kids and urges him to sit beside her to finish the celebratory dinner. Evelyn knows Kelly's character won't change, but she still remembers the Kelly who once had dreams. He was gentle and emotionally stable. Back then, they built their family on their shared love for art and literature. But an accident shattered Kelly's dreams and completely changed the man. Since then, Kelly has only been able to work in a factory and Evelyn had to give up her job at the newspaper to become a full time housewife to take care of their 10 children. Over the years, she has continued writing, submitting work and entering competitions while caring for the kids. She even won several prizes, but those prizes quickly turned into money for food, rent and tuition. Evelyn's efforts were gradually worn down by life and her husband's pride further affected the family's atmosphere. He couldn't bear Evelyn being more capable than him. When they moved into their new home, the whole family was initially happy, finally having their own house. But when the husband heard the kids proudly mention the freezer their mother won, his inner insecurity flared up again. At that point, he started harboring resentment toward everyone in the house. You know how much electricity this thing lead? Well, it inspires me, Kelly. It's something to be filled, mother. Even Howard Hughes couldn't fill that thing. So we got plenty in it already. That night, the kids gathered around their mom, discussing advertisement design while Kelly was in the kitchen listening to a basketball game. Then his emotions suddenly spiraled out of control and he started smashing the freezer that Evelyn had won. He vented his frustrations randomly in the room. For the safety of the kids, Evelyn had to make the children stay out of harm's way. Ahh! What? The neighbors called the police. The police arrived quickly, but they didn't take any action. Instead, they just had a chat with Kelly. The police officers served tea and talked to Kelly. Evelyn could only silently clean up the mess. Soon after, the police left. But Evelyn was later told by their son that a priest had come to their house. Evelyn hoped to get support from the priest. She told the priest about everything that had happened. Kelly has a big family to take care of. I'm sure he's carrying around the weight of the world the more he Drinks, the less he's able to pay the bills, which is one of the reasons he's so unhappy. But it's up to you, you see, to make him a good home, well, you have to try a little harder. Unexpectedly, the priest advised her to understand the sole breadwinner of the family. He even suggested that she should be more considerate of Kelly. The kids didn't understand why the priest spoke to their dad the same way. Evelyn could only comfort the kids, telling them not to mind too much. The next morning, Evelyn asked Kelly for $4 to buy milk for the kids. But Kelly told her that he had no money. She had no choice but to ask the milk man for credit. My children need milk. Please don't make them suffer because I'm delinquent in my payments. If you don't pay me next week, that's it. I'm cutting off my route. I understand. When the milkman finally agreed to let her owe him money, Evelyn returned with the milk. You think money grows on trees? I work my ass off in that stinky sweatshop all day long and you get to stay home. Do whatever you want. Do whatever I want. Sit around all day writing your stupid, stupid notebook. Those stupid notebooks are the only reason this family isn't living on the street. Hey, you wanna trade places with me? However, during their argument, Evelyn accidentally fell. The children were all very worried about their mom. What did you do to her? It's an accident. Honest to God, Toby, I wouldn't hurt your mother in a million years. But Kelly not only didn't realize his mistake, he even began to justify his behavior. Evelyn didn't criticize her husband in front of the kids. She calmly accepted help from a neighbor to go to the hospital for an examination. After everyone left, Kelly sat alone on the stairs crying. He always hurts Evelyn, but he has never truly regretted it, until the evening when the children were watching TV. Evelyn returned home. The kids all rushed over to hug their mom. Kelly walked over with a cup of coffee. It seemed like he wanted to apologize for what happened earlier that day in front of the kids. Evelyn ultimately forgave him. She understood that Kelly would never change.

You're a disgusting excuse for a man! You know what I. You're the one! Don't touch me! You will never touch me again! The woman left angrily. The man stayed frozen in place. Anna met Jack by chance. She was shopping that day. The clerk told her she had won a prize. Oh, my god! I can't Believe. This is so exciting. What? Oh, my god. I never won anything before, and this is the most exciting thing that ever happened to me. Is. I'm. Is that sad? Yeah. No, I don't think so. Really? Yes. Oh, thank you. Anna was so happy that she hugged Jack beside her, and so they became acquainted. They exchanged phone numbers. The next day, Anna told her best friend Ellie about it. She was troubled by the fact that Jack was married. At this point, Ellie told her about her past and advised her that if it was meant to be, she would end up with him. After hearing this, Anna gathered the courage to call Jack and asked him out to hang out. But Jack turned her down, saying he was already married. Anna thought that was the end of it. Unexpectedly, while teaching a yoga class, she saw Jack attending the class as well. Anna happily looked at him. After the class, they chatted together. Before leaving, Anna invited him to go swimming. This time, Jack agreed to her invitation. They sat by the pool, happily chatting, until Jack suddenly said he might really like her. Anna was overjoyed to hear that. She took off her yoga clothes and jumped straight into the pool. Jack watched Anna shyly from the poolside. Meanwhile, Jack's wife had no idea his heart had changed. When her husband returned home, she noticed his scent was different from usual. She questioned Jack about Whether he had done something. But Jack thought his wife was overreacting, so he patiently tried to calm her down and told her not to be so uptight all the time. But his wife could feel something was off about him.

With a flawless face, she was the type many boys adored. Her performances were stunning, earning praise from the director. For the next act, she poured even more energy into it. After the show, she discussed the next plan with her female colleague. But as a student, she had to rush back to school. There she ran into a class reunion, radiating confidence. Even the other girls envied her outfit. On Christmas, she gave her roommate an expensive necklace. When she went home that weekend, her parents saw her spending records and questioned how she'd gotten so much money. She claimed she'd earned it delivering food, but her mother remained skeptical. The next day, she asked the director for payment and he handed it over without hesitation. As the videos gained traction, word spread to her classmates. One classmate started showing the films around and by night she was flooded with private messages. Friend requests poured in non stop. Enraged, she stepped out the next day to find everyone staring at her with eyes. Once her identity as a star was exposed, her life changed dramatically.

That night, she angrily left a comment on his social media hinting that he was dating two girls at the same time. Odd. Unexpectedly, this comment LED to him breaking up with his girlfriend. And at that time, the guy had no idea what had happened. After the breakup, he confided in Doris about the mysterious message. Doris was too scared to tell him the truth. Just then, the guy invited her to his family's Thanksgiving gathering and asked her a question. Would you ever consider dating a younger man? Just curious. Yes. Cool. Come on. This made Doris extremely excited. She thought that on Thanksgiving Day, the guy would definitely confess his feelings to her. So she shared the good news with her best friend. She originally thought her friend would be happy for her, but instead. Original sound. Her friend's words made Doris very angry. Oh, honey, don't you see? You're just a weird little old lady in the funny clothes to them. You're like their. Their Weird Fucking art project. You take that back, Doris, I'm worried about you. You are not my mother. My mother is dead, so you can stop worrying about me. I can take care of myself. She angrily left her friend's house and decided to pursue the love she had longed for. On Thanksgiving Day, she wore a black low cut dress and did her Makeup beautifully and wore the glasses that the guy had once complimented. Feeling a mix of nervousness and excitement, she headed to this romantic rendezvous. At the Thanksgiving party, the guy introduced her to his friends and his 56 year old uncle Frank. Frank's praise and kindness boosted her confidence. However, after the party ended, she still didn't receive the confession she was waiting for. She decided to express her feelings first. So Doris asked the guy to meet her alone. She told him that she had liked him for a long time and that the message she posted out of jealousy had caused his breakup. The guy was a little angry and didn't understand why she did that, but Doris thought that the guy also liked her back. The guy explained the misunderstanding. He actually wanted to introduce her to his 56 year old uncle, but he didn't clarify his intentions, which caused her misunderstanding. Doris broke down in tears. Then she grabbed her clothes and hurriedly left the guy's house in the car. She felt utterly disappointed when she got home. She immediately took off her wig and removed her heavy makeup. She stared blankly at her reflection in the mirror. At that moment, there was a knock on the door. It was her best friend coming to see her. Her friend had already forgiven her for what she had said before. Doris told her friend about everything that had happened that day. Her friend comforted her warmly. And so Doris leaned into her friend's arms. The next morning, she woke up and looked at the things she had collected over the past 30 years. Suddenly, she realized that they no longer felt as important as before. With her friend's help, she started sorting through the things she once couldn't bear to part with. After a whole day of organizing, the previously messy room became neat and tidy. The next day, Doris went to the office. She quit the job she had never liked. And left her belongings as mementos for her colleagues. Then she said goodbye to the guy. Both of them felt a little awkward. Doris apologized to the guy. At that moment, she finally let go of the feeling she had been holding on to. She was grateful that the guy was willing to be her friend. And then she left the office.

He only worked as a waiter. His wife constantly put him down. When he lost his temper, he chased all the restaurant's customers away. It didn't fix anything, but at least the act made him feel alive. Their marriage was dull. Even intimacy felt like a chore and they couldn't conceive a second child. His wife took him to the hospital for checks. In contrast, his 63 year old father in law thrived on affairs, believing occasional infidelity boosts marriage. He even told his wife he was going on dates and she saw through his lies easily. Recently, the father in law used the man as a cover to meet a beautiful woman, inviting him to billiards, but really to see her. The man was flustered by the woman while his father in law smoothly taught the first time billiards player. Afterward, the father in law left with her. The man stared at their backs lost in thought.

She quietly walked into the bathroom and poured the water out so she could get rid of all the evidence. Then she gently turned the camera to monitor her husband's movements. After doing all this, she carefully left the bedroom and went to her husband's laboratory, turned off all the surveillance devices except for the bedroom. Then she deactivated the alarm system. Before leaving, she noticed the password protected safe. Inside there was an empty stand which looked a bit strange, but she didn't have time to think about it. She had to escape from the villa as soon as possible. Just as she was leaving the garage, the dog suddenly ran out wanting to follow her, but she couldn't take the dog with her. She tried to take off the dog's collar but accidentally touched the car, which triggered the loud car alarm. At the same time, all the lights in the villa turned on. She quickly turned around in fear and ran outside. She arrived at the wall she had chosen after much thought and tried hard to climb up. Finally, after a lot of effort, she managed to escape from the place that trapped her. The woman stood outside feeling uneasy about the unfamiliar surroundings. Fortunately, her sister arrived just in time to pick her up. As Emily was still puzzled about why her sister was out so late, Laya's husband suddenly appeared. He was there to Take Laya back. Seeing the man's angry expression, Emily quickly started the car and took Lya away. Then two weeks quickly passed. Lya's good friend suggested she go out for a while. When Laya finally gathered the courage to go out, she wanted to check if there was any mail in the mailbox. At that moment, she saw a man running in black clothes. She was so scared that she immediately ran back to her room, feeling very anxious. While she was talking to James, Emily showed up. Laya was immediately angry when she saw her, because her husband could track her location through Emily and find out where Laya was. Although Laya was rude, Emily didn't get angry, but instead brought her some good news. Even though Jack had passed away, Laya stared in disbelief at the message on her phone. She could finally breathe a sigh of relief. After she calmed down, she told her friend about everything she'd been through in the past few years. Emily felt sorry for her as well. Fortunately, it was all finally over. Maya thought she could start a new life and live happily. But what she didn't know was her family and friends would soon be separated from her due to her husband's plans.

She wasn't worried that the car owner would find her hired. The car belonged to her unfaithful husband. As the sharp screeching sound rang out, she felt that the anger building up inside her over the past few days had faded a lot. Even though she had given her husband many chances to confess, he still chose to keep deceiving her. So now she had finally made up her mind to divorce him. Her husband had no idea that she had discovered his secret. She quickly went to consult a lawyer about the divorce. He realized that she didn't even know how much her husband owned. Although she didn't care much about money, Gemma didn't want these assets to eventually fall into the hands of the man who destroyed her happy family. After listening to the lawyer's advice, she decided to secretly investigate her husband's assets. But before that, she had to pretend she didn't know about her husband's affair. That evening, Gemma arranged to meet Neil from the asset management company to first find out about her husband's financial situation. However, she didn't expect that her neighbor Neil would completely misunderstand her intentions. He mistakenly thought that Gemma was interested in him in order to achieve her goals. Gemma hardly hesitated and followed Neil to the room he had already reserved. Neil believed that doing this wouldn't make him feel guilty towards His wife, Anna. After confirming that Neil simply wanted to have her and had planned to divorce, Gemma agreed to the deal without hesitation. She had always thought her marriage was without betrayal, but because of her husband's infidelity, she ended up being with another man. The next morning, Gemma woke up early and got everything ready to leave. Neil looked at her cold, indifferent demeanor and felt confused, not knowing what she was really after, until Gemma spoke and said what she wanted. If you're asking me to lie, I want something to make up for it. Like what? Simon's accounts, his personal and business, copies of everything stretching back the last three years. Every detail, not just the official stuff, I'm gonna have them looked at. So don't try and hide anything, Gemma. That's a lot of work. I want them this afternoon. If Neil didn't give her what she wanted in the afternoon, she would tell his wife, Anna about it. She wasn't going to hide anything from Anna. At this moment, Neil finally realized that he had fallen into Gemma's trap. He couldn't understand what Gemma really wanted, but Gemma hadn't told him it was all for a divorce. Soon, Gemma returned home. She looked at this home and felt a wave of inexplicable fatigue. So she lay down on the sofa and rested for a while. In the afternoon, Neil promptly prepared all the documents and handed them to Gemma. It was at this point That she realized their family's financial situation was already in great danger. Simon had not only drained years of savings and the inheritance left by his parents, but had also forged his own signature to mortgage their current house. Fortunately, Simon had recently received a 1 million investment from a company called Bushi, which allowed the halted renovation project to resume. As long as these apartments were built and sold successfully, their financial problems would be resolved. But if Bashir Company suddenly stopped investing, they would go bankrupt within a week. Through Neil's explanation, Gemma finally understood the doubts that had been on her mind for days. It turned out that Simon neither agreed to Kate's abortion nor suggested a divorce. In fact, he was waiting for this opportunity to make money. At this moment, Gemma was unusually calm. For her, this might be the best opportunity to make Simon lose everything.

She saw her friend sprinkling a lot of sugar on it. The woman couldn't help but remind her that too much sugar isn't good. But her friend said that if someone like Alice doesn't eat any sugar, it would cause an imbalance in nutrition. These words seem to strike a chord with her, so the woman immediately grabbed some dried blueberries next to her and shoved them into her mouth. Her friend was a bit stunned by her actions. She didn't understand what the woman was doing. It wasn't until the woman's phone rang that she hurriedly spit out the dried blueberries. She ran out to answer her boyfriend's call. It turned out that her boyfriend had discovered that she had lied to him. Now he needed her help and asked her to come back immediately. Alice immediately told her friends that Simon needed her. What? He can't figure out how to turn the dishwasher on? When did he become more important to you than us? Jesus Christ, Tess, not everything's about you. Me. Are you serious? Alice began packing her bags. In the evening, Alice started reflecting on her actions. However, the face of her boyfriend kept appearing in her mind and Alice kept grabbing her hair. She couldn't let go. The next day when Alice was about to leave, she realized that her phone was missing. It turned out that Tess had hidden her phone. Tess asked Alice to Go boating with her, promising to return the phone afterward, Alice agreed. They rowed the boat to the center of the lake. The water surface gently rippled. Tess occasionally rocked the boat. She tried to use this light hearted method to bring them closer together, but Alice had no interest in playing. She just wanted to leave as soon as possible. Suddenly, Tess jumped up quickly. This made Alice lose her balance and fall into the water. Tess thought this might awaken Alice's childhood memories, but instead it triggered Alice's anger. She angrily scolded Tess. Then she grabbed Tess and pulled her into the water. Tess still thought Alice was playing with her. When Alice tried to climb back onto the shore, she suddenly realized that the earrings her boyfriend gave her were missing. She anxiously jumped back into the water to look for them. Even though Tess warned her that the water was 30 feet deep, Alice still dove into the water. She risked her own safety. Though she searched hard, she still couldn't find the earrings. The two of them finally made it back to shore. I can't. I can't. I can't know what. I can't do another thing wrong. I can't do another thing wrong. Alice, what does that even mean? No, I lied to him. He doesn't even know that I'm here. What? I mean, he does now. He called me. Well, why did you lie to him? Because I'm bad. What? You wouldn't love me? If you knew how bad I am, Tess didn't understand why Alice was so anxious. She realized from Alice's words that her best friend's thoughts seem to be controlled by her boyfriend. After returning to the villa, she tried to explain to Alice what the right perspective was, but Alice seemed to be completely uninterested. It was as if she had fallen into her own mental trap. She refused to listen to her friend's advice. Alice angrily locked herself in a room. She was breathing heavily in panic. She even kept pulling her hair as if she didn't feel any pain. Even though Sophie wanted to comfort her, Alice still refused. At this point, she seemed trapped in a situation with no way out.

The boss had become the whale's breakfast. Fortunately, the communication was not cut off and 9, 1, 1 quickly identified the location. That was a humpback whale, which means it hasn't been truly swallowed yet, as humpback whales have very narrow throats and can't swallow adult whales. As long as it opens its mouth to eat again, it may be spat out. But the greatest danger at present is oxygen deficiency. We must keep calm. The fire brigade was dispatched urgently and soon located the target. Air support takes 12 minutes. The oxygen supply is likely insufficient and it must be forced to surface. The captain suddenly realized humpback whales have extremely acute hearing. They used a cone as a loud speaker, connected it to a fire alarm and injected 120 decibels of noise into the bay through pipes. All right, Eddie hit the Siren. Sure enough, the noise was too loud and the whale eventually spat out the boss. The team members immediately jumped into the water to rescue him, but by the time they reached the shore, he had already stopped breathing. After a round of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a miracle occurred and the boss survived. However, when the company's call was connected, everyone was celebrating the company's rebirth.

He had been trapped in the luxury car for three days and nights. The only source of water left was a bottle of yellow liquid. But smelling it, he couldn't bring himself to drink it. At that moment, the voice of the car owner came through the display screen. The owner turned out to be an old man. He said he had locked the car doors to punish car thieves like the man. The old man then remotely turned on the car's air conditioning. The man shivered from the cold. He quickly put on clothes to shield himself from the chill, but still said he wasn't cold at all. Little did he know, the car was covered with surveillance cameras, allowing the old man to fully enjoy watching this poor prey. Ten hours passed. The man couldn't stand the cold anymore. Hungry and freezing, he pulled out the gun from his bag to break the door. But the bullet ricocheted and shot into his thigh. Fortunately, a woman happened to walk by on the street. He screamed for help towards the window. He thought he had successfully caught her attention. But strangely, the woman just came to the window and started putting on lipstick. It turned out the old man had already turned the window into a one way mirror. From the outside, you couldn't see inside. And the car had top notch Soundproofing so the gunshot didn't attract the attention of passers by. Mark had no choice but to take off his shoelaces to tie up the wound to stop the bleeding. He begged the old man to let him out and promised to willingly go to the police station and confess. But what he got in return was the old man hanging up the phone. The man slowly passed out from blood loss in despair, but when he woke up again, he found the bullet in his foot had been removed and the wounds were all bandaged. Just as he was puzzled, the rich man called again. The old man found out he was a thief who had been to prison three times, so he decided to give Mark a huge punishment. The car started to automatically accelerate, heading straight for the rooftop. As the car got closer and closer to the top of the building, Mark desperately begged for mercy. But the car still charged up to the rooftop, slamming the gas pedal full speed towards the guardrail.

Carrying a bucket, Sam thought his plane was actually going to fly. He lifted it and went up to the roof, tying it to his body. He thought the plane would lift him into the air. But just as he was about to jump from the roof, his mother arrived in time and stopped him. He brought him down safely and said, after today, don't touch this plane again. She put the plane in the storeroom, closed the door and locked it. Sam cried because he wanted the plane, but his mother wouldn't listen at all. Sometime later, the plane suddenly flew in from above and broke the window of the house. Then it started causing destruction everywhere. His mother got very scared. She didn't understand what was happening. She picked up a broom, thinking of hitting the plane. But the plane stopped midair and turned bright red with anger. Seeing all this, both mother and son became even more frightened. Sam, scared, held on to his mother tightly. Then the plane slowly calmed down and came down. This made his mother even more terrified. She couldn't understand how a toy could do this. She called her friend Jack and nervously explained everything. Jack quietly went to the boys room and picked up the plane. He examined it carefully but found nothing unusual. Jack, I tried to cut this plane with a knife, but it Didn't get a single scratch, he said. I need to take it to the lab for a full check. At the lab, he put the plane on a machine and started checking its internal parts. To his surprise, there were no electronic parts inside the plane. Jack even tried to crush it in a hydraulic press, but it had no effect. Meanwhile, the boy woke up and, not seeing the plane, ran to Jack's lab. Seeing Jack busy on the phone, he quietly picked up the plane and tried to escape. But Jack pressed all the alarm buttons. The security guards immediately ran to catch him. However, the boy went up to the roof, tied the plane to his body, and then flew into the sky.

At first, the couple thought there was something wrong with the camera, say. That is, until the wife rummaged through an antique chest, pulled out a coat, ran to the window and struck a pose. Wasn't this exactly what she looked like in the photo? Mike was so shocked he could barely speak. They decided to try again. This time, the wife stood in front of the front door for a photo. When the picture came out, a young man was pushing the door open. In the shot, it was Mary's brother. But her brother couldn't possibly be here right now because he had just been sentenced to seven years in prison. Mike suspected there was something unusual about this antique camera. Just then, the doorknob suddenly moved and in walked Mary's brother. He explained that he had successfully escaped from prison tonight and came to his sister for refuge. The couple was stunned, speechless, and the pose of the brother opening the door was exactly the same as in the photo. After some discussion, Mike suggested that this camera could capture scenes 5 minutes into the future, and maybe they could use it to do something big. As the couple was envisioning the future, the brother turned on the TV and a horse race was playing on the screen. Mike Stood up excitedly. Since the camera could capture future scenes, if the three of them went to the racetrack, wouldn't they be able to know the race results in advance? So they pulled a few hundred bucks, ready to try their luck at the track. Right away, the three arrived at the race track and precisely timed a photo of the scoreboard. When the photo printed out, the result was clearly visible. Horse No. 6 one. Mike immediately went to place a bet. When the race started, horse No. 6 was in the middle of the pack. However, as it neared the finish line, it suddenly accelerated and crossed the finish line first. The trio couldn't stop grinning. They checked the scoreboard again. The result was exactly the same as shown in the photo. Once successful, they wanted to continue. With ample funds in hand, they only needed to take a photo before each race, and it seemed there was no possibility of failure. So they kept betting. Round after round, every judgment was accurate, and they counted money until their hands cramped. Back at the motel, Mike immediately ordered a sports car. With this camera, they had finally broken free from their predicament at the bottom of society. At this point, the motel attendant came to collect the plates and curiously picked up the camera from the table to fiddle with it. Mike hurriedly reminded him to be careful not to break the camera. The attendant retorted, what does It mean that this camera won't work. After taking 10 photos, this inappropriate hair, that means 10 to an owner. Mike's heart sank. He quickly sent the attendant away. The trio started counting the number of photos they had test shot, two in the room and taken six at the racetrack today, which meant they only had two chances left. Mike decided to do one more big deal tomorrow. While the wife wanted to save it for future use, the brother suggested simply selling the camera for some cash to go eat KFC. The three started arguing and fighting over the camera, accidentally pressing the shutter and wasting another photo. Mike was furious. When the photo appeared, he saw his wife seemingly screaming. Why do you think she's screaming, Woodward? I'll tell you why she's screaming. She's screaming because somebody's trying to do something to her husband. He abruptly pulled out a knife. Since the camera foreshadowed an ominous omen, he decided to strike first. He pushed his wife away and stalked toward the brother. Step by step, the two gradually retreated to the window and soon engaged in an intense fight. The wife also arrived at the position in the photo. In the scuffle, the two men fell out the window, one after another. At the same time, Mary struck the pose from the photo. Having lost her husband and brother, Mary was in extreme agony. However, we must muddle through these things. We must live with tragedy. She Picked up the camera again and went to the window. Simply for posterity. May you both rest in peace. Mary was about to take the money and leave. Suddenly, the attendant from earlier barged in. He had been eavesdropping on their conversation. The attendant grabbed the cash on the table and quickly stuffed it into his bag. Mary tried to call for help, but the attendant said, your brother is a fugitive, right? I think that when the police come, you'll be the first one arrested. He swept away all their spoils and didn't forget to snatch the bag from Mary's hand before leaving. This one I will leave with you. The attendant picked up the photo and said, looking into the distance from this angle, it seems there are more than two bodies. Mary hurried to the window and looked down. I tripped over a wire and fell out the window. The attendant walked to the window, satisfied. Yes, there are more than two bodies down there. One, two, three, four.

Just as everyone stood there in shock, a large number of animals suddenly burst out from the forest. Again. The students on the school bus were just as confused by the scene. One curious student tried to take out his phone to record it, but another classmate grabbed it and threw it out the window. The student who lost his phone was furious and wanted to get out and retrieve it. But the moment he stepped outside, the animals from the forest started charging straight toward them. The other students on the bus were terrified when they saw this. They all rushed off the bus trying to escape the chaos. One student named Evan stayed inside the bus trying to hide. But by then, the forest fire had spread rapidly. Evan had no choice but to get out as well. Just as he stepped outside, the classmate who had gone to fetch his phone ran over and yelled at him to get back inside the bus. Evan was terrified. He just wanted to get away from there as fast as possible. But now the animals seemed completely insane, attacking people wildly through the thick smoke. Evan even thought he saw some unusual creature among them. Already struggling with anxiety, he collapsed to the ground in fear. At that moment, a runaway vehicle came speeding straight toward him. Thankfully, a female classmate reacted quickly. She saw Evan In danger and rushed over to save him. But in that brief moment, Evan's shoulder was badly injured. The girl kept urging him to run. Yet just as she stood up, Evan noticed something. Something had bitten her on the waist. But there was no time to think about that now. He had to run. When Evan made it to the other side of the forest, he finally realized that all of this chaos was caused by the massive wildfire. The girl who had saved him was named Blake. Later, Blake made it back home, but since her house was located in the disaster zone, her father was preparing to evacuate with her and her younger brother. While packing, Blake noticed the wound on her waist. Strangely, even though the wound was quite large, she didn't feel any pain at all. There was no blood either. Thinking it wasn't serious, she didn't pay much attention and continued packing. But what she didn't know was that this wound was about to change her life forever. Meanwhile, Evan had been rescued and brought to the hospital. When he woke up, he suddenly sensed something strange coming from the bed next to him. Curious, he pulled open the curtain to take a look, and to his shock, there was a giant Bigfoot sheep lying on the bed.

I sat down quietly, not daring to fight back. Because my family was poor, I only had a big pair of worn out shoes. I wanted my parents to buy a new pair of shoes. Instead, they gave me my sister's old shoes. I took a marker and blacked out my shoes to avoid being laughed at by the bully. But the bully still found the brake and laughed at me in public. The teacher turned around and saw the disruptive classmate, but she yelled at me. I drew in silence, seeking solace, only to find my sister messing with my sketchbook. I tried to argue with my sister, but she refused to admit it. My father came into the room, concluded that it was my fault and punished me for going to work. Instead, my father played with my sister. I didn't understand why my father favored my sister and just wanted to prove myself in the race. The game starts with money. A girl joined in. Everyone tried to drive her away. I thought she couldn't win and helped her stay. The race started. Even though my shoes didn't fit, I ran at the front. I thought I was sure to win. But the girl came barrelling out from behind me and easily won. She walked towards me and tried to give me a high five. I was so angry that I slapped her away, but then I realized that she was As friendless as I was and sat directly in the bully seat, I hurriedly pulled her away and saved her life. She tried to strike up a conversation with me, which I ignored. I was so enamored with my painting that I didn't notice the girl when I hid my drawing. She handed me a piece of gum and traded me for the sketchbook. I became nervous, afraid of being laughed at, but she gave a compliment. It was the first time I was recognized. On my birthday, my family threw me a party. My father gave me a racing car toy set, but I had long since outgrown it. I wanted to play with my father, but he ordered me to do my homework. The girl heard about my birthday and prepared a set of paints and brushes for me. That's what I really wanted.

There's a dude posted up outside. They get back inside. Spooky froze when he saw the man. Caesar felt confused until his brother told him that guy was their father, who had just gotten out of prison. Compared to Spooky's coldness, Caesar felt curious about this father he had never met. He wanted to know what his father had been through all these years. However, spooky cut Caesar off. He knew their father was a complete jerk. But Caesar, who had grown up without a father figure, didn't care about any of that. He brought his father to his workplace and even treated him to an employee meal. He even lined up a job for him. Caesar was like a child, desperate for approval. Spooky felt helpless about what he was doing. Who got him a job? Big mistake. Caesar couldn't understand how his brother felt, but spooky was right. On his first day at work, their father stirred up trouble. He tried to use his old status as a former neighborhood leader to intimidate the profit. But his time had passed. Just as the conflict was about to explode, the shop owner stepped in to resolve it. However, this brought the profit's revenge. All the shop's equipment got smashed. Even the owner got hurt. My father realized his arrival was a mistake. He started packing his bags, planning to leave. In the end, he advised spooky to find a legitimate job. Otherwise, one day he would End up abandoned by the gang, just like him. Thanks, papa. I could be president or an astronaut or a movie star. I can be anything I want to be. Because I had such a good role model. I had a shitty dad, too. But you gotta let go of that rage. Let it go. It's the only thing that keeps me going. It's how I survived out here without you. Their father knew spooky wouldn't take his advice, so he grabbed his luggage and left. It all played out just like the scene when he abandoned them before. Except this time, it was Caesar who got hurt. Their father ran away from responsibility once again. Hey, piece of shit! Everything bad that's ever happened in my life is because of you! You're gonna crush him the same way you crushed me. It would have been a lot easier if you just died. You know the worst part about growing up without a father? Is having to be a father to a brother without ever being a son. After calming down, spooky pushed their father away, telling him to never come back. When Caesar found out their father had left, he blamed it all on Spooky. Caesar thought his brother should help their father find another job. He even thought spooky was happy about their father leaving. I'm your brother for most of your life. And your dad. If you're gonna be mad at someone, be mad at him. He's The one that up and left again. In his anger, Caesar shoved his brother away. Spooky tried to comfort him, but Caesar's rationality had been consumed by rage.

The woman turned and hurried away. Yes, he deliberately targeted a woman wearing two layers of formal attire. His goal was to cause a commotion in the casino, allowing him to steal the dice from the gambling table unnoticed. He left the scene, entered the restroom, removed his laundry and sprinkled it over the shoe shining machine. A makeshift polisher was complete. He polished the corners of the stolen dices 4 and 3 until smooth, ensuring he could reliably roll a 7 every time. Returning to the table, he casually tossed the dice and won $10,000 again. As a stack of chips grew, the casino owner took notice. The owner sent a beautiful woman to inquire about his identity, only to hear a name that rang a bell, James Bond. Spotting the owner approaching the table to investigate, he quickly and secretly replaced the dice with a normal pair and threw them naturally. This time he lost. He prepared to leave, but the owner picked up the dice for a closer look. He seized the moment to toss the rigged dice into his juice. Without evidence of cheating, the owner had no choice but to exchange his chips. But just as he was about to slip away, a server brought his juice. The owner picked up the cup and discovered proof of his cheating. His companion, realizing his peril, immediately feigned a collision with the owner's bodyguard, creating an escape route. He sprinted down the stairs, slammed the door shut and used a cable to secure the handle, trapping the boss outside. Facing pursuers armed with guns, he hid behind a liquor cabinet and sabotaged the coolant valve. The cabinet crashed precisely under the attackers. He calmly exited the casino, met up with his companion and successfully escaped.

So I rushed to the hospital for a check up. But the doctor told me not only had my fist turned into metal, even my nerves and organs were starting to turn metallic. If I couldn't control it, I would eventually become pure metal. But somehow, all my organs were still working normally. To keep, I twisted the doctor's neck and killed him on the spot. As my body kept turning to metal, I found that I could absorb electricity and even release it to attack others. I had no idea where this power came from. A day earlier, a scientist named Reid discovered a mysterious cosmic cloud in space. After studying it closely, he believed that if he could collect a sample from that cloud, he could extract a substance capable of changing human genes, and every incurable disease on earth could be cured. But to collect that sample, he needed a massive amount of funding. And the only one who could sponsor him was me. Without thinking too much, I agreed, but on one condition. I had to go with them. So we headed to the space station. But as we were preparing to collect the sample, Reid was shocked to find the cloud that was supposed to arrive in seven hours had appeared early. He yelled for us to return to the cabin, but it was too late. The mysterious cloud was Rapidly approaching us, because the hatch was still open. Graham was completely engulfed by the strange energy, and the other four of us were also caught in the radiation. But the energy didn't seem to harm us. To be safe, we decided we should return to earth for examination. At first, everything seemed normal, but as days passed, I started to notice strange changes. During a ski trip, Jack's body suddenly burst into flames. He fell off a cliff, and to my shock, he turned into a man of fire, burning straight through layers of no. Luckily, he wasn't hurt. Meanwhile, Peter was having dinner with his girlfriend Susan, when suddenly her body began to disappear. Panicking, he knocked over a wine bottle. Peter reached out instinctively to catch it, and to his surprise, he found his body could stretch like rubber. Just then, Jack came running in, completely naked, showing off his new ability to ignite flames at will. By now, three of the five people exposed to radiation that already developed strange powers. As for Graham, who took the most radiation, no one knew what was happening to him. At that moment, Graham was suffering unbearable pain. His heart rate had exceeded human limits. Even the bed frame collapsed under his weight. Reed grew anxious. He tried to open the door, but couldn't. Then he had an idea. He stretched his fingers through the gap and actually managed to unlock the door. But when they opened it, everyone Was stunned

Instead of punishing him, Helena allowed Jack to take a walk outside with the woman. But. But even then, Jack showed no interest in her. As soon as Helena came near, he sat on the ground and started writing something, maybe trying to talk. But Helena didn't pay any attention. Right then, the science minister arrived, and she got busy talking with him. At that moment, another human came and erased everything Jack had written. Angry, Jack attacked him, and once again he lost his chance to talk to Helena. When he was thrown back into the cage, the minister looked at his drawings, but erased them all. Instead of reacting, Jack sat helplessly inside the cage. Then Helena came back. Jack quickly held her hand and grabbed the pen and paper. The guard hit him, but Jack hurriedly wrote his name. Helena was shocked a human, considered the lowest in their society, could write. She took Jack to her home to study him more closely. Jack wrote on a sheet he was from earth, and after a spaceship crash, he was captured. Helena's Husband laughed and said, he's crazy. Flying is impossible. But Jack proved it. He took a small piece of paper, folded it into the shape of a plane and threw it. That tiny paper plane became the symbol of their world. Helena's husband was stunned. Just then, the science minister arrived. When he saw the paper plane, his face changed completely. He immediately ordered the guards catch Jack, as if Jack was hiding a dangerous secret.

Five months later, our child was born. Out of responsibility, I gave her and the baby a home. But every day she dressed up in heavy makeup, stayed out all night and left the baby to me alone. That night, as soon as she went out, I followed her holding the baby. I went into a bar and saw her lying in another man's arms. When I got home, I didn't say anything. I just wanted to talk to her calmly. Is even my son. But in that moment, I realized I was just a backup. Consumed by rage, I pushed her. Her head slammed into the wall, but she never woke up again. A drop of water fell on her forehead. When I looked up, I realized my son was still in the bathtub. That day became the worst day of my life. Now with nothing left, I turned myself in. I was sentenced to 25 years in prison. 20 years later, during an appendectomy, I escaped by jumping from the hospital window. I ran into a supermarket and in the chaos, I took a boy hostage, forcing him to take me to his mother. This is my mother, Adele. Mom, this is Frank. He needs our help. When Adele saw my bloody face, she tried to refuse to help, but this was my only way out. I grabbed her son by the neck. She nervously Paid at the counter. Without alerting anyone, we went to her house. When I stepped inside and looked around, Adelle secretly hid a knife. Sensing her fear, I refused the coffee she offered and admitted that I had just escaped from prison. That's when they realized they were helping a fugitive. I swore I wouldn't hurt them. Then the television suddenly played breaking news, a murderer had escaped. It was my face on the screen. Seeing Henry's terrified eyes, I decided not to drag them into trouble. I suggested tying Adele up, carefully helping her, moving her body gently, making sure not to hurt her. She could feel my tenderness and slowly began to relax. To apologize for intruding into their lives, I cooked dinner using what was in the fridge. Since she was tied up, I blew on the food and fed her bite by bite. That small act of care made her completely let her guard down. At night, patrol cars circled outside. I had no choice but to stay a little longer. The next morning, I got up early and made them breakfast. Adel tasted it and said it was surprisingly good. Henry, however, looked nervous, staring at the newspaper on the table. Seeing the intelligence in his eyes, just know that there's more to this story than you see in that paper, though. How'd you escape? I told the guard at the hospital if he left, I was gonna jump out the window. I heard that. He went to have a smoke. Nothing misleads people like the truth. We started talking about his family. How many brothers or sisters? I've got a stepbrother and a half sister. My dad takes me out to dinner with him on Sundays. How does a fellow let a woman like your mother get away? He got together with his secretary. Good riddings. That's when I Learned he'd always lived alone with his mother. To repay them, I fixed the broken steps, stacked the firewood. Anne changed the oil in the car. I taught Henry how to play baseball. Adele watched me under the sunlight and even mended my torn pants for me. Just as I was enjoying this simple life, a neighbor suddenly came by. I immediately hugged Adele and told Henry to answer the door, reminding him not to give anything away. The neighbor brought peaches and warned that an escaped convict was nearby. Henry calmly saw him out. Afterward, I took the peaches and tasted one. The peach. Too bad they're all so ripe. Never get through them all. We should throw most of them away before they rot. I have another idea. Not wanting to waste them, I taught them how to make peach bread. For a moment, we looked just like a real family. I held Adele's hands as we needed the dough and I could feel her emotions shifting. Henry could tell his mom might be falling for me. I sat beside Adele, placing my Hand gently on her waist. She rested her head on my shoulder. But then sirens blared outside the house. I decided not to cause them any more trouble. Under the cover of night, I prepared to leave, but Adele didn't want me to go. Maybe tomorrow. But your stitches have had a little more time. They're not gonna stop looking at them. They have dogs that can smell your blood. You should probably let your stitches heal. You should stay.

I see it. Things got to be worth a thousand bucks. What a figure! About £125. I was about to leave when I realized the one lying there was its mother. Looking at the baby cougar in front of me, I decided to adopt it. To feed this little cougar, I risked stealing food from humans. Under my care, the baby cougar gradually grew up. Once grown, the cougar Learned to hunt, too. It would bring me the fish it caught to eat. One day, we were targeted by a pack of wolves. I took it and ran like crazy. But we were eventually caught up to. I tried to scare the wolf pack away, but they showed no signs of leaving. Hey, get out! Get out of here! Get out! Check it out. Is that a wildcat? No, it's a cougar. It's a young cougar. The little cougar, who had never seen humans before, ran off, too. But I didn't run. I want food from humans. I found the Puma with food. We had a good meal together. The next day, the forest was covered in heavy snow. The little cougar had never seen snow before. We played together in the snow. Suddenly, I heard dogs barking. Get out of there! Because of our calls, we accidentally triggered an avalanche. We immediately went to rescue its owner. At that moment, two humans heard the noise. And rushed over, too. Together, we rescued its owner. Is he breathing? Call 9 1 1. Is he gonna make it? Yeah. Saved his life. What about the dogs? These are his. I mean, I guess that's up to you guys. We can call animal control for you, but we can't wait for them. Sorry, guys. Good luck. They thought we were together and wanted to take me along with them. I looked reluctantly at the little cougar in the distance as the humans forcibly took me away.

His imagination twisted it into something far more disturbing, ultimately sparking a deadly misunderstanding. The next day, Jack visited a journalist's home to investigate a recent bank robbery. The moment he stepped inside, he sensed something was wrong. Bloodstains on the floor revealed that violence had already occurred. A note on the table in instructed him to pick up a bloodstained knife, while another demanded he record a message. Lieutenant Frank Drebin, I did it. Okay. Entering the bedroom, Jack discovered the journalist was already dead. He instantly realized he had walked into a trap. As a seasoned detective, his instinct was to destroy the evidence. But in his panic, when lifting the body, he moved too roughly, making the situation even worse. At that moment, the police arrived at the door. With no way to explain the scene, Jack had no choice but to flee in desperation. He's running.

Get out of the bed, idiot! I carefully cleaned up the scene, then followed the trail of rose petals. I opened the door and saw my boyfriend setting up a surprise. I was going to surprise you, but it didn't work out. It turned out Mike had planned a proposal for me. I pretended not to notice the decorations in the bedroom, then put on the dress he had prepared and walked in. I slipped on the engagement ring, trying hard to calm myself. Ah! What? What? What? Yes! Yes! Oh my god! This is the best day of my life! I made up an excuse to get Mike out of the room, but he stopped me. He pulled out champagne from under the bed, but all I wanted was to leave quickly. Mike said there was another surprise. I recorded everything. Haha. Um. It's a keepsake. You forgot it. What? He couldn't wait to watch the video. I panicked trying to stop him, suggesting we wait until the wedding to watch it together. We agreed and left the room. And cut! We re shot the proposal scene from that day. The fake video looked perfect to me, but Sam said something was awful. What? Don't. Don't come over here. Look. You see? What? There was a vase here yesterday. My husband's favorite vase was missing. I immediately called to ask, only to learn Mike had broken it that morning. I froze, not knowing what to do. I just found the same vase. There's a spot across the town. We need the exact same vase. We heard there was a vase just like it. We were overjoyed, but someone else had already claimed it. I need this vase. Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm buying it. Well, you can choose another one, but I don't need another one. I need this one. No matter how I tried to persuade her, the old lady refused to give up the vase. Then I came up with an idea. I paid to buy it and then rented it back at a high price. But the old lady still wasn't at ease. I have one condition. I go with you and make sure my vase stay safe. So the three of us went to the bedroom to film. I finally got the perfect video. Soon it was our engagement day. But I saw someone I didn't expect. The old lady from before was there, too. And she actually knew Mike. I want you to meet my Aunt Louise. She has a very bad memory. Don't forget who you are in an hour. Nice to meet you. Then everyone headed to the banquet hall. Mike was about to play his proposal video. Was it good? My aunt doesn't have the best memory, but she remembers my apartment perfectly.

No, mommy, daddy, it's too early without it. They left me in this empty place like I was nothing. That moment I finally understood what living alone really meant. The first few hours, I almost lost it. It wasn't fear. It was that crushing feeling of being abandoned. By nightfall, my stomach started turning. I forced myself to get up. The fridge was packed. They had made sure I'd have enough food. But to me, only the stuff I could eat right away really counted. Couldn't reach the top shelf. In the end, I just sat there staring at a few canned good. I tried using the can opener. It wouldn't work. So I grabbed a fruit knife instead. And just like that, it happened. Yeah, I panicked completely crying. I ran out the door, not even knowing where I was going. I ended up collapsing in my neighbour's kitchen. There were donuts on the table. I grabbed one and ate without thinking. I asked who I was. I repeated what mom told me before she left. I'm 22. I just look small. She let me borrow her phone. I called again and again, but mom never picked up. That's When I saw her, she was on a talk show. Her book had just come out. He was going on and on about parenting. She said children need to be heard. That line hit me like a nail to the heart. For a second, it gave me hope. The next day I went to the library to read her book, but the moment I opened it, I froze. Except she had cut me out of it. I just stood there like someone stomped on my chest. The librarian tried to stop me. I grabbed the book and ran back home. Every single face in that photo, I pressed so hard, my knuckles turned white. But then I regretted it. I didn't really hate them, but I just wanted a home. The day started to blur. Same thing over and over. I got numb. I stopped hoping anyone would come until one day dad showed up. I clumped in him like he was a lifeline. I almost broke down. But the way he looked at me like I was a stranger. If the library hadn't called him, he never would have come. What the fuck, Natalia? What is this? Is this like a hit list or something? No, no, no. I was sad because, because you guys let me out of it. Good grief, Natalia, if you're not clean once since the last time I was here, let's see how you're doing on food. Looks like you got plenty to eat.

Because the other plane had been attacked by a swarm of bees, bees flooded its cabin through the ventilation ducts. The pilot was stunned and instantly lost consciousness. The plane went out of control midair. The captain tried his best to adjust and avoid it, but he still couldn't escape the collision. The co pilot was sucked out of the cabin instantly. The oxygen masks dropped down at once. That's when I saw the situation in the cockpit. I realized we'd all face death like this. I crawled into the cockpit with great effort. I found the captain's leg badly injured, but his hands were gripping the controls tightly. With all his strength, he pressed the autopilot button. Once the plane leveled off, the captain passed out. So I took out my phone to call for help. They Learned the situation and contacted air traffic control for us. But now there was no pilot. At this moment, only I could protect the passengers lives. The plane was on autopilot now. I tried to wake the captain to take control, but the flight attendant brought bad news. Many passengers were hurt from the impact. The hole torn open at the top of the plane was getting bigger. I had to tell the flight attendant to guide passengers away from danger and move to the front of the cabin. Only by helping each other could we survive inside. I was terrified. I Went back to the cockpit and left a message for my family. Just then, air traffic control called again. They brought in a pilot to guide me. But I had zero experience. For everyone's lives. I took on the responsibility. The pilot first told me to turn the plane around. But seeing the buttons on the panel, he didn't know how to operate them. Suddenly, a kid who loved flight games showed up. This one. I turned the knob. He pointed at the plane, drew a perfect dark. Just when I thought things were back to normal, the crack on the plane's roof suddenly widened. Everything in the cabin got sucked out. The plane started descending. While I was at a loss, the kid showed up in time. We had to increase the plane speed. Now. The kid grabbed the control stick. In no time, he made the plane level with the horizon. Air traffic control saw the plane back to normal. They wondered if there was another pilot on board. Overjoyed, I let the kid say hello to them. Hello? Is that a kid? Whoever it is, he's very lucky to have him. That was very close.

The catch? The room had no internet, no entertainment of any kind. Just a double bed and a bathroom. The organizers promised to provide daily nutritional supplements, but nothing more. And there was one more rule. Both participants had to complete the challenge together. If one of them gave up along the way, the other would still get a payout, but only $1 million instead of five. A young couple thought it sounded easy. Without hesitation, they pressed the start button. The countdown began. They were thrilled at the idea of becoming millionaires in just days, already imagining the luxurious life that awaited them. At first, things were fine. The challenge even seemed to bring them closer. But as the days dragged on, they realized it wasn't nearly as easy as they had thought. Every night, the lights would shut off automatically forcing them to rest. Every morning, they were woken up right on time. The food never changed. Simple, bland and repetitive. Still, for the prize, they endured. Lisa tried meditation to pass the endless hours, while Matt kept himself going with exercise. When boredom became unbearable, they played silly little games. Time moved painfully slow. By the 20th day, both of them were already drained, staring blankly at the ticking clock. Then one day, a cockroach appeared in the room. Oddly enough, Matt was delighted. Desperate for Something new. Even began feeding it from his own rations. But this broke one of the rules. The food was for contestants only. When the organizers reminded him of this, Matt broke down. He begged them to open the door so he could release the cockroach, but they gave no response. Finally, he decided he'd open the door himself and put it outside. Lisa panicked. She tried to stop him, afraid that opening the door would count as forfeiting the challenge. Matt argued that as long as he didn't step out, it shouldn't matter. But Lisa wasn't about to risk losing millions of dollars over a bug. The two of them fought bitterly afterward. Matt placed the cockroach gently on the floor. But before he could do anything more, Lisa accidentally stepped on it, crushing it dead. I'm sorry. It was an accident.

Seeing all of this, Crixus secretly set a goal for himself. One day he would Become as strong as Ganicus. At the same time, beaquitus was preparing to sail into the city.

Then they smashed through the glass wall of the skyscraper. From 400 meters in the air. They opened their parachutes and scattered stolen diamonds over the slums. The gems fell like stars, landing in the outstretched hands of the poor. The robbers themselves didn't keep a single stone. Their next appearance was in the skies above Mexico. At 10,000 meters, they hijacked a cargo plane, dumping tens of millions of dollars in cash. Like a storm of rain, the money slammed into the parched earth, feeding countless starving families.

It was the hunger for extreme challenges. The contempt for rules. I knew that feeling well because once I lived for it. I joined the FBI after an extreme biking trip with my best friend.

Oh, Lily. Hi, sweetheart. Come here. Come. If you ever put your hands on my daughter again, I will string you up by your feet, run you up the flagpole with the birds. Pack out your eyes. Mr Tucker, put that boy down. He pulled my daughter's hair. Please apologize to Connor for using your hands instead of your words. Sorry, little fella. I would like to see you in my office right now, please. Me too. Mr Tucker, what happened out there was unacceptable. I agree. Is this kindergarten or the Hunger Games? I'm speaking of your behavior. We've never had an incident like this and now we've had one on the first day before circle time. Boy's parents are coming in and trust me, their man is. Hello, Kitty. Oh, you told his parents on us that that is so not cool. Well, I'm sure once they hear what their boy did, they will be understanding. Alright, whoever made our son cry has messed with the wrong moms. Lesbians, while often lump together, gay men and lesbians have less in common than one might think. Like in the ven diagram of sexual identity, you have gay men and straight men, both the same gender. Then you have gay men and straight women, both attracted to the same gender. But gay men and lesbians, nothing. I am so sorry we have to meet like this, but I'm sure you can understand as parents the instinct to Protect your child. Yeah, it's what makes me wanna punch you in the neck right now. Wow, I see where your son gets all of his aggression. Okay, let's all take a time out. I'm gonna give you a little homework assignment. I want you and your kids to have a family play day. Maybe if the four of you can get along, you can set a better example for your children. Okay, we have an assortment of spring rolls here, all vegetarian, of course. Oh, cause I'm a lesbian, I'm automatically a vegetarian. I saw it on the L word. I assume they have consultants. I'm just saying it's an offensive stereotype. We're the only gay parents in the class. Yeah, we should be supporting one another. I mean, we have so much in common. Exactly. Uh, you know, Connor is having a birthday next week. Maybe Lily would like to come. Oh, she would love that. Oh, great. Are you guys having a clown? God no, I hate clowns. They're so creepy. Maybe you just don't like them cause they wear makeup. You know what? I'm out Connor, we're leaving. You don't understand. Cam used to be a clown used to be once a clown, always a clown go. Not now, not now. Stop Connor, let's go. Why is this door locked here? Let me please Lily, open this door right now. Okay, I'm not hearing anything. Are you sure they're fine? Oh, how are you sure, Connor? Lily, Connor, Lily, got something over the hole. Lily, Connor, I can't see anything from outside. The curtains are closed. Open up, Connor. Well, why you have a hot dog? What if something happened to them? What kind of hazards you keep in there? Well, it's here. So we keep our gun collection, our abandoned refrigerator and our chocolate covered hypodermic needles. Why are gay men always so sarcastic? It's my coping mechanism. That's it. Lily, Connor, if you can hear me, back away from the door. I'm gonna break it down. I'll help you. I don't want Connor to go. I wanna stay. Thank God they're alive. I love him. Oh, you love the idea of him. Now open this door, sweetie. Can we really have hot dogs? Yes, we promise. Come here, sweetheart. If you ask me, sometimes we get so hung up on our differences, we forget the one thing we have in common when it comes to the safety and well being of our children. We're all a little bit nuts. You have dainty little hands just like your daughter. You have boots like my dad.

That's it! You could have shot me. Come on, Manny. I could have unbuttoned your shirt if I wanted to. Now come here or sink. And I'm faking this? With me in the car, I was almost too depressed to come today. I realized I let my childhood slip away. Look at Luke there, making one big shot of three. Never change, Luke.

At this point, the German soldiers in the tank realized that someone in the tank, they tried to speed up to throw him down. Seeing this, the cook hurriedly took off his apron to cover the tank's periscope and tore off his shirt sleeve to cover the other observation port. Without vision, the tank instantly lost control and crashed straight into a military tent completely immobilized. In order to break down the German psychological defenses, the cooks intentionally created heavy footsteps, axe crashes and ear splitting shots. It made it sound to the Germans as if the Entire Soviet army was charging. He also lit some hay and stuffed it into the tent, and the smoke soon burrowed into the tank. With this kind of interference, the German soldiers in the tank completely panicked, thinking they were surrounded. So they opened the hatches and came out obediently to surrender. The Soviet cook even threatened the Germans to throw away all their weapons. Then he pulled out a rope and told the prisoners to tie themselves up. When the German soldiers turned around, they were shocked to find that the one who had captured them and seized the tanks was only a cook. Not long after, the Soviet soldiers out on patrol returned to the camp, saw the German tanks, thought the enemy launched an attack, immediately lying down into a combat position. But the commander probed, but only to see the cook soldier holding up his gun and shouting, come on, brothers, the meal is ready. The soldiers walked into the camp only to see German sausages already on the table, a German tank parked next to it, and four prisoners tied up on the ground.

But when command handed me this mission, I felt the weight of it in my bones. Our objective? Locate and destroy the heretic ruins. Death rate 100%. What kind of mission is this? Still, I accept it. I had to know what made it so deadly. Our squad had four members. Titus wore four golden rings, a soldier I personally promoted. As I boarded the dropship, I prayed I'd bring them all back. We landed. The heretics sensed us instantly. Weapons drawn, they charged. I LED the blade, bearing guards forward, ready to face the swamp. Titus followed behind, dragging a heavy iron crate. The enemy closed in. Combat was inevitable. We cut through the cannon fodder. But then I spotted tanks in the distance. I raised my shield, blocking every bullet aimed at me. Before I could act, Titus broke formation, charging straight into the hail of gunfire. He smashed through an armored vehicle, leapt onto a tank, slashed down its crew and dropped a grenade inside. One tank gone. As I carried the crate, I shot Titus a warning glance. Disobeying orders is the gravest sin in war. His mission was clear. Protect the crate at all costs. We pressed forward. Soon we entered a zone twisted by demonic energy. Visibility was near zero. Even The soil reeked of corruption. A massive crater opened before us. Without hesitation, we jumped in. Gravity shifted. Darkness surrounded us. Demons attacked. Centuries of combat honed my instincts. We tore through them, dragging the creek. We reached a silent corridor. Towering structures line both sides. At the end stood a steel door edged with runes. It opened on its own. A demonic statue loomed ahead. We stepped into the central hall. Titus lifted the crate and opened it. A priest emerged, dropped to his knees, hands clasped, chanting prayers. We raised our weapons, probing the statue's depths. Stone fell from above. The priest summoned a shield that held against every strike. Then the statue's sword lit up. A winged succubus appeared. She landed. Time froze. Bullets hung midair. We turned our fire on her. No effect. She struck. The priest died instantly. The shield vanished. We were frozen in place. She approached. One of our warriors, touched him, pulled him into a hallucination. Inside that illusion, he crushed a small figure. His head exploded. In reality, the illusion was filled with black liquid. Her domain. She magnified her victim's deepest fears and killed them with it. The first warrior died because he doubted his own worth. She conjured armor that crushed his skull like paper. Then she came for me. And I saw my greatest fear. Titus standing beside me, consumed by darkness, just like I'd always feared. He stabbed me. But when she tried to control Titus to Drag him into her realm. She discovered something unexpected. He wasn't afraid. Inside the illusion, Titus shattered her weapon. Time resumed. He struck, and the succubus fell. The statue collapsed. Coordinates locked. Command initiated a nuclear strike. Titus tried to carry me out, but the blast was imminent. I knew my time had come. I ordered him to leave me behind. My duty is done. It's time to go. Not yet, old man. He refused. Determined to save me. He donned his helmet and walked toward the heretic army. I watched that boy risk everything to protect me. And I felt grateful. My fear never became reality. Because a child like him could never be my nightmare.

They even carry it to a crowded area to show off, oblivious to its power to destroy a city. A villager suggests selling the bomb for food, so a few clueless villagers carry it to the city. Worried the bomb might overheat, they occasionally water it along the way, unknowingly accelerating its fuses. Hours later, they finally arrive in the city center. The mayor, seeing the bomb, is terrified. To prove it's safe, the villagers hit the bomb again with sticks. This causes the mayor to panic and order them to move the bomb far away immediately. Reluctantly, villagers obey and move it to the seaside in front of the crowd. The two men toss the bomb into the ocean, and the mayor breathes a sigh of relief. Villagers are furious. They could have traded it for 100 tons of food, but now it's gone. As they walk away, the bomb explodes in the ocean. The blast stuns everyone. Before they can react, villagers rush to the sea. The explosion has brought hundreds of tons of fish, ensuring the villagers will never go hungry again.

It began moving constantly inside his body. Finally, it burrowed straight into his brain. When Jordan woke up, he was a different person. He, who never ate raw meat, bought a whole shipping container of it to keep his wife from noticing. He lied. He told her the container was her birthday gift. As days passed, red patches spread on Jordan's neck. His body was gradually becoming stiff, yet his craving for raw meat grew stronger. One night, Lisa was taking a shower. Jordan extended a tentacle, ready to attack. Fortunately, his reason managed to overpower the urge. Although he didn't harm his wife, the bug compelled him to find a host for reproduction. So Jordan went to his mistress. He made Mary the host for his offspring. From then on, Jordan's condition worsened. Lisa sensed something was wrong, but Jordan brushed it off as a mosquito bite. However, the truth couldn't stay hidden forever. That evening, police came to investigate Mary's disappearance. Witnesses had seen Jordan at her place, and Mary's phone showed calls from him. The police suspected Jordan was the kidnapper. Lisa was devastated by her husband's betrayal. She remembered the locked basement. She was determined to discover its secret. As Lisa opened the door, a foul stench hit her. She slowly pulled back the plastic sheet, revealing a horrifying scene that was too gruesome to look at.

Looking at my bleeding arm, but he was very calm. He said the bracelet couldn't be removed once worn, but it would be of great help to me in the future. Then my father turned away and disappeared. As an adult, I worked as a lowly repairman. I worked hard every day to buy an oxygen mask for my sick wife. For earth was now on the brink of collapse. All the plants had almost disappeared. Oxygen became a scarce resource. All the surviving human beings lived on a kind of oxygen mask. But until this day, the owner of the oxygen company suddenly approached me. She told me that I might be able to save mankind. With doubts, I followed the owner to the laboratory. There is a machine that can connect to the future. Cuz just yesterday they received a message from 400 years from now. And the only thing it said was my name. They thought that 400 years later, mankind must have found a solution to the oxygen crisis. But time machine can only send one person to the future. So the boss sent me on this mission in order to keep my sick wife alive. So I put on a protective suit and was transported 400 years into the future. When I opened my eyes, I was shocked by what I saw. There was plenty of oxygen, but not a soul in sight. I followed The satellite cell phone to an experimental base. Until I saw the remains of a human body at the entrance. And the name on the collar was my own. The remains also had a bracelet on their hand. Only the red light on it had turned green. I found the remains satellite cell phone and asked it to play back the last video log. Started with two people arguing and ended with a gunshot. Have I already been here once and been shot? But I hadn't seen a soul in all the time I'd been here. Soon night fell and I lit a fire in the woods. Then I picked some unknown fruits to feed myself. But soon I was vomiting and sick. Just then, a bright light passed through the sky. Immediately, a figure approached me and drove a needle deep into my chest. When I woke up again, I found my best friend in front of me. It turned out that the fruit I just ate was highly poisonous. The headquarters detected that my vital signs had plummeted, so they sent my best friend to the future to save me. After adjusting our condition, we set off to look for clues. Soon we arrived at the gate of a base. I cautiously stood at the door. Then a robotic arm protruded from the gap. After scanning and recognizing my eyeballs, the gate opened smoothly. Inside, it was pitch black. A computer flashed a message for me to activate I carefully pressed the entry key. Suddenly, the bracelet tightened and the red light turned green as blood flowed out. As access was granted, the time machine in front of me lit up. This place is exactly the same as the lab 400 years ago. In order to find out what happened, I opened the video log again. It turns out that my father wanted to use the time machine to find a way to save all humans. But the boss only wanted to take some people to the future to continue human civilization. The two sides didn't agree, and the boss shot my father. But in fact, my father had already set a limit on the time machine. Only my DNA can open it. The boss sent someone to get close to me to make sure I grow up and open the portal. She was worried that I would jeopardize the plan and get rid of me. The truth came out and the scene from history repeated itself. My best friend pinned me against the wall and aimed a gun in my head. But at the last moment, my best friend didn't do it. He knew I was the key to saving the past, so he shot himself without hesitation. Meanwhile, in front of the experimental base 400 years ago, group of social elites were waiting in front of the time machine. Just as the boss was about to lead his men inside, the time machine suddenly lit up. Instead of me, hundreds of extinct plants came back. I hope that mankind can rebuild its home. This is the hope we've been searching for. Inside was also footage of the boss murdering my father. I then completely destroyed the future's time machine. I left myself in the future and transported hope back to the past. Finally, the skeleton in front of the lab door disappeared. When I came back to the outside world, I found it was a new world.

Casey noticed the car stopped and grabbed a screwdriver to protect herself. No, no, no, no, shut up. The robber threatened her to stay quiet, then pulled out a sedative to knock her out. Just then a voice came from behind him. Hey, you okay there buddy? Hank can't feel this off. Yeah. A passerby returning to the car felt something was off, took out his phone and prepared to call the police. But the next second, 9, 1 1. The police rushed to the scene but the robber had already switched cars. And escaped. Fortunately, they were able to lift his fingerprints from the broken glass. Suspect is a Michael Lewis Foster.

Luckily, there was a small river ahead and we jumped right into it. And just as we hit the water, the hunting dogs made it to the river bank too.

And his partner did have his body camera on, and Grayson did not. Then Grayson testified this week that he was scared of Sonya because he thought that she would throw boiling hot water on him. The same boiling hot water that he told her To go pick up. So if you really felt like she was a threat, why are you instructing her to go grab a pot of boiling hot water? Wouldn't you just do it yourself? Closing arguments are expected to begin tomorrow.

Around 9:30 yesterday morning, police responded to a call from a young boy who said that everyone in his home was dead. Officers described it as nothing short of a massacre, with Jonathan shooting Lindsay, Ethan, Dylan and Lucas, but leaving his ten year old unharmed. Now, according to police, sometime overnight, Jonathan and Lindsay became involved in an altercation. Jonathan then, quote, armed himself with a gun, and he shot her several times. At that point, he reportedly started going through the house and systematically killing their children. There was actually just one child found in his bed, with investigators saying that they were hunted down and killed. Now, aside from that, we know investigators didn't find any signs of a struggle and that ultimately they found two bodies upstairs and two bodies downstairs. They say that why the young, the question wasn't killed remains a mystery, and that he was released to other family members at the scene. There were also no previous calls to the residents or reports of domestic violence. And it seems like everyone is wondering what happened. Lindsay Candy was known to be a wonderful mother, and 18 year old Dylan just graduated from the local high school last year. Ethan was a 9th grader there, and Lucas was a 6th grader at the intermediate school. And anyone with information that could help this Investigation is asked to contact the homicide tip line at the number above.

He gradually started to recover. To make sure the salt level stayed high enough, the artist and I agreed we need to stock up on more tomorrow. I taught him to read pictures and words like a teacher would, carefully marked the calendar. This was when the canal locks would open to the sea, the perfect time for him to return to the ocean. To avoid suspicion, Zelda and I kept to our regular work schedule. With the creature missing, the supervisor interrogated everyone at the facility. He checked our time cards but found nothing suspicious. He figured janitors wouldn't have the guts to pull something like this. As I was leaving, I signed, you're an asshole. The already irritated supervisor got even more pissed off. What is she saying? She, she is saying thank you. Zelda quickly stepped in with an explanation and he finally let us go. When I got home, I found the artist slumped on the floor. He'd been watching over our guest and had worn himself out. He dozed off from exhaustion, starving, the creature had crept into the living room. The cat hissed at the stranger. He hissed right back. By the time the artist heard the Commotion and came running. The cat was already dead when the artist tore into him. The creature realized he'd messed up badly. As he bolted, he accidentally slashed the artist's arm. The artist told me to find him fast before he caused any more trouble. Following the bloody handprints on some flyers, I tracked him down to the empty movie theater downstairs. I brought him back home and quickly tended to the artist's wound. The creature was deeply sorry for what happened. To make amends, he placed the artist's hand on the scales at the top of his head. The mysterious blue light glowed instantly. Then he moved the hand to the artist's wound. The artist felt what seemed like electricity spreading through his body, but he didn't think much of it. The next morning, the artist woke up to a shock. His bald head was now covered with thick hair. He couldn't believe his eyes. He ripped off the bandage on his hand and found the wound had miraculously healed. Meanwhile, I was spending time with the creature. As I touched his body, a strange sensation washed over me from the inside out. He reached toward my clothes. Startled, I turned and left. But that electric feeling stayed with me. I made a decision that defied all logic. I walked back into the bathroom, deciding to follow my heart and let things unfold naturally.

To save on food and control the prisoners, he actually chained hundreds of inmates together, sewing them into a living human centipede. Their mouths and rear ends were stitched together, stretching for miles, enough to circle an entire soccer field. Not only did this reduce food consumption, but it also made managing them easier. To make sure the prisoners at the back could still get enough to eat, the warden deliberately placed a large inmate at the front. When the mayor came to inspect, the warden proudly showed off his creation and even suggested a bold idea, connecting the prisoners end to end in a closed loop to create a human perpetual motion machine. According to him, it would save a fortune, needing only occasional glucose feedings. After the inspection, the warden eagerly awaited the mayor's approval, only to be met with outrage. The mayor glared at him, calling him a cold blooded monster and then turned and walked away. Standing there stunned, the warden realized he had crossed the mayor's line.

The doctor went ahead and tested my hair, but the results came back totally normal. He thought I might have split personality disorder, so he asked me how I've been sleeping. I told him I slept just fine, except I always woke up feeling exhausted and worn out. And my ex husband, who lives downstairs, he'd been calling me lately, wanting to get back together after hearing all this. But the doctor seemed to have figured something out. He had me spend the night in the hospital sleep lab the next day looking at my brain waves. He noticed they became extremely active after midnight. That's a classic sign of sleepwalking. The truth finally came out. Turns out I've been sleepwalking to my ex husband's place every night, which explained the pregnancy and the hickey. The doctor suggested I just go home and remarry the guy, joking that I couldn't even keep my ex out of my dreams. Then he prescribed me some medication to help treat my sleepwalking problem.

This was our plan to smuggle the $5 million we'd stolen out of the country. But there was so much money that I had to wrap the rest tightly around her stomach. Before long, she looked like she was eight months pregnant. If we could just make it through airport security, we'd have more money than we could spend in several lifetimes. To avoid suspicion, we deliberately entered the security area separately, one after the other. Sure enough, when the security staff saw she was pregnant, they waved her through without asking many questions. But just as my girlfriend glanced back at me, I was suddenly stopped by an officer. She looked nervous, but had no choice except to keep her cool and keep moving forward. Turns out my passport had no entry or exit stamps. Fortunately, I stayed calm and after some quick talking, managed to ease the security officer's suspicions. Next came the most critical part. The full body scan, or hearts were in our throats. If anything went wrong, not only would our whole plan fall apart, but we'd be fat being life in prison. I thought we'd covered all our bases. But to my shock, the moment my girlfriend walked through the metal detector, a piercing alarm blared. My heart nearly stopped. Thankfully, my girlfriend Janna quickly removed the necklace from around her neck, which resolved the crisis and allowed her to pass through without further incident. To avoid drawing any more attention, we picked up our pace. Thinking about how we'd soon escape the law and start our new lives as wealthy people, we couldn't help but smile.

I grabbed it and just before it exploded, I hurled it back. But to my surprise, the next morning I woke up completely unharmed, put on the same blue shirt as yesterday, stepped out into the street, then got shot dead on the spot. Yet the next day I came back to life again. This time I met a beautiful woman on the street. Something about her hit me instantly. Love at first sight. Just as I was about to walk up to her, a train roared past blocking my way. But it did matter. After all, I die and come back every single day because I'm just an NPC, a background character in this game world programmed to repeat this same routine. Put on the blue shirt, drink my coffee and head to the bank for work. In this world, the people wearing sunglasses are the real players, poor like me. Without them, we just end pieces destined to leave. Inside, someone else scraped. As usual, I waited for the players to rob the bank. A few sacks opened fire. It is seen it all before. Calmly, I hit the ground and even started chatting with the security guard. Then suddenly I saw her again, the same girl from yesterday. My heart raced. I wanted to chase after her, but every move I made was restricted, bound by invisible code. I tried to borrow a player and sunglasses. He Punched me instead, but somehow I managed to snatch a pair. And from that moment on, everything changed. Throughout those glasses, I could see things, icons glowing everywhere. A med kit appeared on the ground. I touched it and my wounds healed instantly. When players went down, cash spilled out of their bodies did up and my bank balance shot up. So I went shopping, bought the sneakers I could always wanted. But my strange behavior didn't go unnoticed. The programmers started watching me. They thought a hacker had broken into the system, so they entered the game themselves to erase me. When I realized I was being hunted, I ran for my life. In a moment of panic, I noticed a button on my shoes. I hit the switch and leapt straight up to the 8th floor. But the programmers were fast. They were right on my heels. With nowhere left to run, I jumped again. They couldn't stand it anymore. They started rewriting the gaming code, building walls and barriers between the skyscrapers, chased me relentlessly, but the path ahead was gone. I had no choice but to dive into the void below. I tried to grab a rope but lost my grip. In that split second between life and death, I selected the shield icon and somehow I survived, escaped their pursuit. In the end, even in this game, I was still just at one NPC.

With each collision of the pillars sending vibrations through the ground, the floor beneath them suddenly vanished and they fell into the pit below. When they came to, they found themselves inside the legendary golden fortress. Before they could even process it, the steps beneath their feet began rapidly retracting inward.

However, the old man beside them seemed completely unconcerned. He walked over to a dust covered door, then pulled out a crystal ball. According to legend, this very crystal ball was the key to the golden fortress. The man glanced at the groove on the door and Immediately realized what to do. Slowly he lifted the crystal ball above his head. In the next moment, the door began a chain reaction. Within seconds, a secret passage appeared. The group carefully stepped inside and the scene they encountered was beyond belief. Golden light radiated from every corner and even the walls were constructed from solid gold bricks. Several crystal statues were arranged around the room. Then the group noticed something unusual. They approached one of the statues and saw that a portion of it was missing. A teammate immediately held up the crystal ball again, but in that instant, the unexpected happened.

He not only betrayed our marriage, but quietly moved all our assets. I never thought he could be so cruel. But I vowed my revenge would be ruthless. I went straight to his mistress's home. I told her parents that their daughter was having an affair with my husband and she was pregnant. That bomb shattered everyone. Then I filed for divorce. I took back every asset he had moved. Got nothing. Not a penny. Not even custody of our son. He was humiliated and furious. He swore to get revenge. I thought he had no more moves. But he went to the hospital where I worked. He reported me to my boss. He lied that I threatened a patient's family. He smeared me as mentally ill. And he demanded the director fire me. But the truth was, the man had long abused his wife. If I had once warned him that if he kept hurting her, I would take him to court. Now those two joined forces against me. My husband kept insulting me. He said I was broken by my parents, failed marriage. I lost control and slapped him. He used that

At first, I thought some kid was playing a prank. But when I peeked to check, I realised the culprit was my neighbour. So to get back at her, I rushed over and pounded on her door. Just as I was about to confront her, I saw the obvious bruise on her arm and it hit me right away. Maybe she was using that to signal for help. So I swallowed my anger. I made a couple of polite remarks and plan to leave. But right after the door closed, I immediately called the police. Before long, cops showed up. Her husband was taken away for domestic violence. I thought it was finally over. But when she came to thank me with a grateful smile, I noticed part of the bruise was missing. That felt off and made me suspicious and her expression turned cold in an instant. She didn't say another word. Then she just shut the door. In that moment, I felt a strong sense of unease. So I decided to find out the truth. I quietly snuck into her house. What I saw next shocked me to the core. The injuries on her body were all staged. What chilled me even more was a strange man walked out of the room. They smiled at each other and they casually let the truth.

When he saw an elderly person with a cane beside him, the man kindly offered his seat. Unexpectedly, the elderly person immediately declined his kindness politely. So no matter what time he took the bus, there would always be a seat available for him. But the man felt very dejected because he clearly knew that all of this was due to his frightening face. When he was just born, his mother showed a strange expression upon seeing him. When he went to kindergarten, the teacher was so scared by his terrifying appearance that she collapsed to the ground. In elementary school, he only had to look at someone and everyone would share their food with him. In his innocence, he thought there were many good people in the world. It wasn't until after he entered high school that he never had to queue anywhere he went. Only then did he realize it wasn't that everyone was kind, but that he looked terrifying. Therefore, at 35 years old, he had never had a girlfriend. At this moment, a cute girl walked straight up and stood beside him. He looked at the girl in surprise. After seeing his face, the girl not only didn't avoid him, but actually smiled and nodded at him in greeting. This was the first time the man had seen someone smile at him, which Made him develop good feelings toward the girl. But the man knew very well in his heart that to him this girl was like an angel and he didn't dare express his love. One day while working in his own shop, he unexpectedly encountered the girl who had made his heart flutter last time. He recognized her at a glance from the bus. It turned out the girl had suffered from face blindness since childhood and the man's fierce and menacing appearance was the only face she could recognize. Just like that, the two quickly fell in love and successfully entered the hall of marriage like a beauty and the Beast love story. After getting married, the couple ran a flower shop together. But the man's appearance would scare customers. So every time a customer came to buy flowers, he would actively turn his back and let his wife serve them. Even so, the man's terrifying appearance would sometimes make passing plain clothes police officers mistake him for a wanted criminal. The man was very depressed because his wife was about to give birth and would be going back to her parents home for three months tomorrow. But with his terrifying appearance, he couldn't serve the customers who came to buy flowers at the shop. Therefore, he was very troubled and sought advice from friends. At this time, the beauty salon owner actively stepped forward and suggested giving him a makeover to make him look more amiable. Because 90% of A person's first impression depends on their hairstyle. He decided to give the man a wavy perm. After the perm was done, he became even more terrifying. Everyone saw this and didn't dare make a sound. At this moment, several students walked into the beauty salon and were immediately scared by the man's appearance. Screaming in fright, the man felt helpless and was about to give up when the beauty salon's chief designer walked confidently behind him and without hesitation, cut off the hair ends he had kept for many years. As time slowly passed, everyone's expressions gradually became so surprised that their mouths couldn't close. After the man finished his makeover and returned home, he initially thought his family would dislike it. Unexpectedly, after his wife saw him

Looking at my bleeding arm, but he was very calm. He said the bracelet couldn't be removed one worn, but it would be of great help to me in the future. Then my father turned away and disappeared. As an adult, I worked as a lowly repairman. I worked hard every day to buy an oxygen mask for my sick wife. For earth was now on the brink of collapse. All the plants had almost disappeared. Oxygen became a scarce resource. All the surviving human beings lived on a kind of oxygen mask. But until this day, the owner of the oxygen company suddenly approached me. She told me that I might be able to save mankind. With doubts, I followed the owner to the laboratory. There is a machine that can connect to the future. Cause just yesterday they received a message from 400 years from now. And the only thing it said was my name. They thought that 400 years later, mankind must have found a solution to the oxygen crisis. But the time machine can only send one person to the future. So the boss sent me on this mission in order to keep my sick wife alive. So I put on a protective suit and was transported 400 years into the future. When I opened my eyes, I was shocked by what I saw. There was plenty of oxygen, but not a soul in sight. I Followed the satellite cell phone to an experimental base until I saw the remains of a human body at the entrance. And the name on the collar was my own. The remains also had a bracelet on their hand. Only the red light on it had turned green. I found the remains satellite cell phone and asked it to play back the last video log. Started with two people arguing and ended with a gunshot. Have I already been here once and been shot? But I hadn't seen a soul in all the time I'd been here. Soon night fell and I lit a fire in the woods. Then I picked some unknown fruits to feed myself. But soon I was vomiting and sick. Just then, a bright light passed through the sky. Immediately, a figure approached me and drove a needle deep into my chest. When I woke up again, I found my best friend in front of me. It turned out that the fruit I just ate was highly poisonous. The headquarters detected that my vital signs had plummeted, so they sent my best friend to the future to save me. After adjusting our condition, we set off to look for clues. Soon we arrived at the gate of a base. I cautiously stood at the door, then a robotic arm protruded from the gap. After scanning and recognizing my eyeballs, the gate opened smoothly. Inside, it was pitch black. A computer flashed a message for me to Activate. I carefully pressed the entry key. Suddenly, the bracelet tightened and the red light turned green as blood flowed out. As access was granted, the time machine in front of me lit up. This place is exactly the same as the lab 400 years ago. In order to find out what happened, I opened the video log again. It turns out that my father wanted to use the time machine to find a way to save all humans. But the boss only wanted to take some people to the future to continue human civilization. The two sides didn't agree and the boss shot my father. But in fact, my father had already set a limit on the time machine. Only my DNA can open it. The boss sent someone to get close to me to make sure I grow up and open the portal. She was worried that I would jeopardize the plan and get rid of me. The truth came out and the scene from history repeated itself. My best friend pinned me against the wall and aimed a gun in my head. But at the last moment, my best friend didn't do it. He knew I was the key to saving the past. So he shot himself without hesitation. Meanwhile, in front of the experimental base 400 years ago, group of social elites were waiting in front of the time machine. Just as the boss was about to lead his men inside, the time machine suddenly lit Up instead of me, hundreds of extinct plants came back. I hope that mankind can rebuild its home. This is the hope we've been searching for. Inside was also footage of the boss murdering my father. I then completely destroyed the future's time machine. I left myself in the future and transported hope back to the past. Finally, the skeleton in front of the lab door disappeared. When I came back to the outside world, I found it was a new world.

Struggling, I tore it off. The golden egg was now covered in blood. Its six claws slowly retracted. At first, I paid it no mind, but by evening, I felt an unusual thirst. Drinking copious amounts of water brought no relief. Only when I saw a plate of bloody raw meat did I realize I craved blood. I suppressed the urge, but my body grew feverish. The wound on my hand itched intensely. Biting my palm or cutting it with a knife offered no relief. Suddenly, I realized the problem lay with the golden egg. So I retrieved the egg once more and placed it on my injured hand, claws extended, piercing my flesh and drawing blood. Miraculously, all discomfort vanished instantly. In its place came an overwhelming sense of comfort. I collapsed to the stairwell, reveling in the experience. Next day, I discovered I had grown younger through the Golden Eggs power. My wife was astonished by the change and delighted with my transformation. To understand why, I sought out an antique dealer. He revealed it was a device granting eternal life. But it would make the user dependent on human blood, eventually transforming them into bloodthirsty monster monsters. Yet the allure of immortality proved too great. I couldn't resist. In the days that followed, I began using the Golden egg frequently. Watching myself grow younger and younger filled me with joy. But disaster struck at a banquet, a Man suddenly began bleeding from his nose. This instantly ignited my desire. The scent of blood stirred an inexplicable restlessness within me. I followed him to the restroom. Even after he left, I began licking the blood stains from the sink. But just then, someone else emerged from the bathroom. I feigned composure, halting my bizarre actions. He gasped under his breath and wiped away the blood. My mood hit rock bottom. Just as I prepared to leave, I spotted a lingering bloodstain on the floor. I immediately dropped to my knees and began devouring it. But as I lost myself in the act, someone approached and kicked me unconscious.

This random woman bit me. Honestly, it didn't hurt as much as you think. Actually felt kind of nice. And she pulled out a bottle of her own blood, told me to drink it. I thought she was joking, so I drank it. Tasted like watermelon juice, honestly. Sweet. Then the woman just disappeared like smoke. When I got back to my dorm, I started feeling really sick. My roommate thought I had the flu. Suddenly my stomach was in an intense pain. I threw up everything. The next day I was lying in bed like I was dead. Couldn't move. My roommate was sweet. Bought me cold medicine. She was reading me the instructions. Then a fly flew right into my eye. I didn't even react. My roommate realized I wasn't breathing. She immediately had Siri call 9 1 1. I'm not sure I got that, Siri. The paramedics came, confirmed I was dead. But right before they were about to take me to the morgue, suddenly set up. What the fuck? I thought you said she was dead. I checked them three times. Oh my. I'm. I'm sorry. You should bail me because I'm still on my parents insurance. Ma'am, you were dead. I'm fine now. So I just wanted to get out of there. Cause the sunlight felt like it was burning my skin. After that, my body started doing even weirder stuff. My reflection in the mirror didn't match. What I was doing. I slowly grew fangs. When I had nightmares at night, I'd float up without realizing it. My roommate freaked out. She grabbed her phone to record it, but she was shaking so much. Just open the camera. And I fell back onto the bed. And it got weirder. I turned into a night person. And I had this unnatural craving for blood, which is crazy because I'm literally a vegetarian. In art class, when I saw a painting of Jesus, I got instant goosebumps all over. My skin became super sensitive. And what's even scarier, sometimes I wanted to rip my roommate to shreds. So I went back to the park to hunt, sneaking around. That's when the woman who bit me showed up again. It is very disgusting for me to see this little one like this. She is like a disabled, very sickly donkey that you want to smash in the skull because it is just too pitiful to look at. Her name is Nadia, a real vampire. She decided to personally teach me how to become a proper vampire. Nadia took me to her huge old house. She said every vampire has a special power. Now she needed to test what mine was so I could hunt my first human. I can fold my tongue like a taco. What's that? Oh, no, no. Not just power. Is wall crawling super impressive. Anywhere her hands could touch, she could just climb up. No effort. Then She told me to try. I didn't get very far, just fell. The noise brought Najah's husband, Lazlo. Najah introduced me, but Lazlo didn't see me at all. Who? Jenna. Who's Jenna? She's right there. Alright. I didn't see you. She should be in a bloody cage! Lazlo! Horrible thing to say. Oh, see what you've done? Ruin her confidence. Damn idiot! Jenna, Lazlo is very sorry and he has something to say. I hid in the room, too upset to come out, until I heard Lazlo apologize and say he'd teach me his best skills. Then I came out. Lazlo decided to test my bat transformation ability. When I turn into a bat, there's no real skill to it at all. I just shout, bat! Human form, your turn! I took a deep breath, shouted. But I turned into this massive, ugly, fat monster. Could barely even fly. Okay, calm down. Just stop screaming. It's terrifying. What would you even call that? I just don't understand. Turning into a bat is the easiest thing for a vampire to do. I'm not disappointed with Jenna's progress so far. So, you know, maybe she doesn't have a special power. So what? She's a below average vampire. Either way, I do think she's very much ready for her first human meal. Nadia took me to a human party. Told me to just seduce anyone and drink their blood. I tried talking to people, but everyone acted like I wasn't even there. Completely Ignored me. I totally lost it. Why does nobody hear me? Ah! Haha! Nadia was super excited because she finally figured out my power. I can go invisible. It's a super rare ability. Now I could finally complete my first hunt. Soon, something weird happened at the party. A guy was being dragged by air. I dragged him outside to the bushes. Enjoyed my first taste of human blood. I was so excited, I asked Nadia if we could watch the sunrise together. But Nadia told me, sadly, I can never be in sunlight again, or I'll burst into a ball of flames. I quickly thought of a solution. I grabbed a motorcycle helmet nearby. Said if I wear the helmet, the sun can't get me. Then we went up to the roof. Turns out reality was nothing like that. And that's how I almost killed my vampire mentor.

When the instructor saw this, he thought the recruit was used to fancy food from outside and looked down on the mess hall's meals. So he stepped forward to scold him, but the recruit said this food was like pig feed. Before the instructor could react, the recruit casually threw his plate aside. The instructor was furious and ordered him to pick up the discarded bun and eat it. But the recruit claimed the food was made of plastic. The instructor didn't believe him at all, so he went to the kitchen to verify. He grabbed a handful of rice and tasted it and discovered the rice was actually made of plastic. He asked where all these materials came from, but the chef told him not to ask because they couldn't afford to mess with the supplier at this moment. The instructor also found that the flour bags were filled with sand. Even the pork was made of plastic. Instructor was extremely angry because the soldiers were ready to fight for their country at any moment, and now someone dared to fake their food. The instructor immediately assembled all the soldiers, determined to make the corrupt merchants pay for their actions. Just as the soldiers were about to take action, an officer called. The officer said he gave the order and deliberately had the supplier do this. And his reason for doing so was To help the soldiers better adapt to different dietary environments. But the instructor still didn't believe it. He suspected the officer was definitely hiding something. But due to their ranks, the instructor didn't dare to question further. Without the supplied food, the soldiers could only go up the mountain themselves to find usable food. The recruit felt very sad when he Learned about this. The soldiers didn't understand why the officer would do this, so they temporarily formed a combat team and headed to the supplier's factory. They quickly found the supplier. Just as they were about to interrogate them, the officer called again, ordering them to release those two people, then dismissed the recruit on grounds of insubordination. The instructor was powerless about this too, but what they didn't know was that an even bigger conspiracy was waiting for them.

I wanted to steal it while he was unconscious. But suddenly he woke up and grabbed my hand. Thank you. I was confused, but also thrilled. Then I showed off the watch to my co workers. Little did I know I would soon regret it deeply. When I got back to the lounge and took out the watch to admire it, I noticed the words cherish time engraved on the back. But I didn't care at all. I put it on without hesitation. The moment I did, the hands of the watch started spinning wildly. At first I thought it was broken, so I tried to fix it, but nothing worked. Just then, my coworker walked in. The shock on his face made me realize something was wrong. He handed me a mirror, and I couldn't believe my eyes. In just 10 minutes, I had aged 10 years. Seeing my wrinkled reflection, I instantly realized the watch was the cause. I tried to take it off, but no matter how hard I pulled, it wouldn't budge. Then I thought of the homeless man, so I ran straight to his hospital room. But something strange had happened again. The frail old man had turned into a young guy. Take back your damn watch now! no, man. I'm not falling into that trap again, okay? Takey? Takey, can you hear me? I can Hear you all right, but your hearing is about to get worse. I told you. Thanks for rescuing me. Wait, wait, wait. Okay, I get it. What do I do now? How does it even work? I wish I knew, man. I stole this watch from a guy yesterday morning, and now I get why he didn't start chasing me. Anyway, since I nearly died today, you have about a day to live. Good luck. After hearing what he said, I was so terrified, I collapsed. In just half a day, my body was 60 years old. I knew I couldn't keep wearing the watch, so I told my coworker to break my arm to get it off. But just as he was about to swing, something eerie happened. The watch vanished into thin air. Before I could even breathe in relief, it appeared on my left hand, and the hand spun even faster. That's when I realized brute force wouldn't work. Only someone else could remove it for me. So I walked down the hallway trying to give it away, but everyone refused to take it. Just when I thought I was doomed to die, a woman rushed in with her dying father, asking for help. I saw a glimmer of hope and ran toward them. I told the woman to get a doctor while I tried to use the old man's hand to remove the watch. But suddenly, the man's heart stopped. I panicked and started CPR immediately. Luckily, after a few moments, he began breathing again. My coworker stared in shock. I turned young again. I grabbed a mirror to confirm it, and the watch dropped to the floor on its own. It turned out you had to do a good deed to remove it. When I looked at the back of the watch again, I finally understood that time is truly priceless.

But for my girlfriend's safety, I needed to be careful. Then the guys buddies came out. They were heading out for dinner. The guy warned me again, then just left, looking at their big figures. The car thing could wait. My dad's car? Are you fucking kidding me? That. That's the car? The one that's driving away? How the hell we're gonna find them now? Then I walked straight into the supermarket and got their address. When we got there, sure enough, found that car. Here's what we're gonna do. It's no car, so I can't wire it. You get in the passenger side, lay low while I sneak around, find it up. We'll be out of here before they can say, what the fuck? But looking at those guys, I still couldn't help walking up. I grabbed the beer from the cooler. The guy was still laughing at me, so I stomped on the beer can, watching them jump up all panicked. I crushed another one. The guy stopped laughing real quick. Hey, you touch one? More beer! We won't kick your ass, bro! He sent out a big dude, but I wasn't scared of him. Crushed another beer can. The big guy knocked me down, but I got back up like nothing happened, then took him down with the last beer can. The guy rushed out, but I wasn't afraid of him. Then a woman came out. My mother was actually here. Even though we'd been separated for years. She recognized me right away. Then mom invited me in for dinner. But she abandoned me when I was six. So this dinner was pretty awkward. Looking at that guy's face, I really wanted to throw a plate at him. But that was just a thought. Wish someone would punch him for the sake of mom buying me clothes. I let him off this time, but when we got back, mom wanted to kick me out. I trashed the place in anger, then got straight into the car. But the car wouldn't start at all. When I looked back, I found out there was a Jack stuck behind it.

A boy passing by saw the woman's panicked expression. He wanted to help her open the window, but the woman refused. The boy was confused. As he stepped outside, he saw a maid working nearby. He accidentally touched the maid's butt, saying he just wanted to know how big her hips were. To his surprise, the maid cooperated, unexpectedly lifting her skirt without even looking back. And just like that, on an otherwise ordinary afternoon, Jack experienced his first transformation in life. From that moment on, he became bolder. One day, he saw the maid carrying things and went up to help as they passed through the doorway. The entrance was too narrow, so he took the opportunity to lean his head against the maid. The maid didn't resist. Then Jack pushed the maid down, saying he just wanted to know how many layers her skirt had. Seeing through Jack's intentions, the maid generously removed her clothes and gave in to him. After these two experiences, Jack started imitating other men's actions. He trapped another maid who had just delivered food to him against the door. From then on, every maid in the manor knew him. Every night they would line up outside Jack's room to chat. After some time, the women in the manor mysteriously became pregnant. They all went to marry their partners, and that was when Jack knew it was time to leave. His happy life was Coming to an end.

He didn't seem to notice anything, just coldly told me not to disturb them and kicked me out. But I really couldn't stand seeing her being lied to. So I came up with another plan. I walked over carrying two cups of coffee, smiling as I said they were free from the shop. But I had made a secret Mark on one cup, hoping she'd noticed something was off. Sure enough, her eyes changed. She realized I was trying to tell her something. She excused herself to go to the restroom, but actually came straight to me and asked what I was trying to say. I hesitated for a few seconds but still told her the truth, that her husband was cheating. What are you telling me? He's constantly bringing different women here. I've seen it myself. No, look, Adam is not like that. And, you know, maybe those meetings were work related. They're definitely not work related. Look, how do you know? Because I had an affair with him, too. What? Hey, you little tramp. I didn't know he was married. He never wore a ring. I swear. I just didn't. Know what are you up to? But my husband is not like that. No matter how I explained, she still refused to believe her husband would betray her. While we were arguing, the man suddenly showed up. The woman immediately walked away. Before I could react, he came up to me with a threatening smile, told me to apologize to his wife and say I had made everything up, then ordered me to meet him at the usual place that night or I lose my job. I knew he was close with my boss, so to keep my job, I had no choice but to do what he said. Mom, I'd like to apologize. My behavior was unacceptable. Exactly. And by the way, we're not paying for dinner. It's coming out of your salary. Yes, sir. Now, bounce, you're still in the mood. Get lost. I hope this Lucy girl gets fired soon. Lucy. That night he showed up as usual, thinking I'd let him do whatever he wanted like before. But what he didn't know was the woman in his arms this time wasn't me. Women Solidarity. Ever heard about it? Our marriage is over. And I hope you're first were worth half of everything you own.

If I took them on time, he might make it back for the birth. But 20 years passed, the food at home ran out long ago. To give the baby some nutrition, I set traps at the door to catch nearby small animals. Since I couldn't move well, I ended up eating them raw because of a poor digestive system, stomachache. At night, the baby struggled inside me. He wanted to come out. I gritted my teeth to find the jar, but the last herb was gone. Without the medicine, he kept wriggling inside me.

But suddenly, a bug burrowed into his stomach. It began moving constantly inside his body. Finally, it burrowed straight into his brain. When Jordan woke up, he was a different person. He, who never ate raw meat, bought a whole shipping container of it. To keep his wife from noticing, he lied. He told her the container was her birthday gift. As days passed, red patches spread on Jordan's neck. His body was gradually becoming stiff. Yet his craving for raw meat grew stronger. One night, Lisa was taking a shower. Jordan extended a tentacle, ready to attack. Fortunately, his reason managed to overpower the urge. Although he didn't harm his wife, the bug compelled him to find a host for reproduction. So Jordan went to his mistress. He made Mary the host for his offspring. From then on, Jordan's condition worsened. Lisa sensed something was wrong, but Jordan brushed it off as a mosquito bite. However, the truth couldn't stay hidden forever. That evening, police came to investigate Mary's disappearance. Witnesses had seen Jordan at her place, and Mary's phone showed calls from him. The police suspected Jordan was the kidnapper. Lisa was devastated by her husband's betrayal. She remembered the locked basement. She was determined to discover its secret. As Lisa opened the door, a foul stench hit her. She slowly pulled back the plastic sheet, revealing a horrifying scene that was too gruesome to look at.

Both of them fell into the depths of the sea. After a long time, both the sisters opened their eyes with fear and panic. The younger sister immediately supported the elder one and calmed her down. Along with panic, the air in their oxygen tank was also running out fast. Only then they realized that they were now trapped at a depth of 47 meters in the sea. They neither got any sign of help nor could they see any way out. Now they had to rely only on themselves. But they did not want to sit there and wait to die.

Luckily, the waitress thought I was trying to order food, so she asked what I wanted to eat, spaghetti, omelette and I'm sorry, baby, please. But when the waitress saw what I ordered, she shook her head and said, they did not have those dishes here. I thought my plan had failed again. But then the waitress looked at the menu carefully. That was when she realized I was asking her for help. So she cleverly told me the kitchen could make those dishes for me. Then, while clearing the plates, she purposely spilled water on Tony.

Their restaurant relied on people like him to stay in business. Meanwhile, Tony quickly found me. He banged on the car window telling me to get out. I was terrified. I started the car to try to escape, but Tony lifted the hood with his bare hands. Then he tore out the wires and kept pounding on the window, threatening me to get out. Just then, the waitress ran over holding a bottle of wine. She apologized to Tony for what had happened. Then she told me to get out of her car. I got out and handed the keys back to her. I thought she would be scared of Tony's power, but the waitress had already come up with a plan. The next second, a crowd of reporters surrounded us. She knew a rich man like Tony was most afraid of exposure. So Tony had no choice but to give up on me. In the end, that was how I was finally saved.

But seeing John's fierce expression, Jack, knowing he couldn't win, had to hurriedly get off. Still facing this rare chance, I mustered the courage to take off my headscarf and quickly wrote the rescue message on the scarf with lipstick. Then, while John wasn't looking, I swiftly tossed the scarf next to the driver. I thought the driver would notice right away, but to my surprise, the driver actually picked up the scarf and came over to me. He angrily scolded me for littering.

This time he asked the driver to wait before departing because one of his classmates was still on the way. But the driver Didn't want to break the schedule for them. Yet, at Jack's request, and afterwards, Jack offered to pay an extra waiting fee, the driver finally agreed to wait. As Jack walked past me again, he secretly showed me the writing on his palm. That's when I realized Jack had come back to rescue me. But until nightfall, the driver still hadn't waited for Jack's classmate. Facing complaints from other passengers, the driver decided he wouldn't wait any longer. When Jack tried to step forward to negotiate with the driver, unexpectedly, he had an asthma attack and collapsed to the ground. The driver, terrified, immediately stopped what he was doing and ran over with a first aid kit to check on him. Seeing Jack wasn't doing well, he urgently asked if there was a doctor. Fortunately, John is a surgeon. But just as he was about to examine Jack, he realized the man in front of him was the same guy who had stared at me that morning. And John seemed to see through Jack's intentions. Soon he noticed the SOS message written on my leg. Faced with my bold move, Angry John was about to scold Jack for meddling. The next second, I was behind him with a fire extinguisher. Before he could react, I smashed the extinguisher down on his head. Unfortunately, John didn't get knocked out.

He remembered nothing from last night. My hands shook as I cleaned his wounds. He left for work. In a panic, I walked toward the kitchen. Bloody footprints covered the floor leading straight to the bedroom. I followed the trail. Our dog was hiding under the bed, trembling. That night, I put cotton gloves on my husband. I thought that would keep him safe. But at dawn, he got out of bed like a puppet, walking toward the living room. I followed him. He stood at the fridge, swallowing raw meat and raw eggs. An entire raw fish went down his throat. I couldn't stop him. I started gagging. He suddenly appeared behind me, drinking frantically from the faucet. The dog was barking in terror. I followed my husband to the bedroom. He opened the window. About to jump. I lunged forward and pulled him back. He hit the floor and finally woke up. He remembered nothing.

But after examining me for half an hour, the doctor told me I didn't need any treatment. He said it would get better if I just stayed away from my husband for a while. I tried to explain that I've been divorced for years and I hadn't dated anyone since then. But the doctor didn't believe me. He thought I was lying. No matter how much I tried to explain, the doctor stuck to his diagnosis. The next day I came back. This time my stomach was hurting and after doing an ultrasound, the doctor told me I'd had a miscarriage. Now, I was really pissed off. I don't even have a husband. But the doctor still wouldn't believe I was single. He couldn't wrap his head around it because the test results don't lie. After making some quick notes about my case, he just turned and walked away. But guess what? I was back again on the third day. This time my neck was hurting and after checking me out, the doctor said it was a hickey. I told him I'd already looked it up online and I was sure it was an early sign of cancer. The doctor was getting frustrated. He still thought I was making things up. I kept telling the doctor I didn't have a husband and I hadn't had a boyfriend in ages. Seeing how insistent I was. He pulled out a couple strands of my hair, planning to run some kind of psychological test to see if maybe I'd gotten a boyfriend without being aware of it. But I stood my ground. The doctor went ahead and tested my hair, but the results came back totally normal. He thought I might have split personality disorder. So he asked me how I've been sleeping. I told him I slept just fine, except I always woke up feeling exhausted and worn out. And my ex husband, who lives downstairs, he'd been calling me lately wanting to get back together after hearing all this. But the doctor seemed to have figured something out. He had me spend the night in the hospital sleep lab. The next day looking at my brain waves. He noticed they became extremely active after midnight. That's a classic sign of sleepwalking. The truth finally came out. Turns out I've been sleepwalking to my ex husband's place every night, which explained the pregnancy and the hickey. The doctor suggested I just go home and remarry the guy, joking that I couldn't even keep my ex out of my dreams. Then he prescribed me some medication to help treat my sleepwalking problem.

In a fit of hopelessness, I went straight to the rooftop. At that moment, I wanted to end my miserable life, because before the exam even started, when Tony still hadn't shown up, I tried asking strangers passing by for help, but not a single person was willing to lend a hand. In the end, I placed my last hope on the Proctor. But to my shock, even the teacher gave up on me. Now I no longer have the right to blame anyone.

She discovered she could control her own blood. But in the next moment, despair took over. Her uncontrollable blood pierced her mother's throat. She didn't even have time to scream. Her powers spiraled out of control again. Her father, rushing to help, lost his life as well. And the horrifying scene was witnessed by her younger sister. To her sister, there was no doubt her sister was a murderer. Just like that, the once happy family of four was shattered because of Mary's uncontrollable powers. Mary loathed her abilities with all her heart, but she knew she had to learn to control them. Only by mastering this power could she stop hurting innocent people. But as soon as she entered the Superhuman University, regret set in. The training methods here were brutally harsh. At any moment. Life threatening danger alert! What made it worse for Mary was that she was placed in the performing arts college. University is divided into two main colleges. The Lamp Bearer College and the Crimson Count College. The Lamp Bearer College focuses on crime fighting, and it's the most popular college in the university. The top 10 elite students are almost all gathered here. Crimson Count College, however, is completely different. It specializes in developing superhuman talents for the entertainment industry. Most graduates end up in showbiz. But Mary had no interest in singing or dancing. So she decided to apply for a Major change. Before she even met with the professor, a female assistant blocked her at the door. Mary still tried to argue, but then the professor suddenly shot a gun. The female assistant in an instant turned into a man. It turned out he was Jordan, ranked second in the school with the high level ability to change genders. Mary didn't have time to be surprised and quickly explained her request to the professor. But things didn't go smoothly. Her request was rejected on the spot, and the professor even kicked her out of the office. Her abilities were still not enough to be taken seriously. Later, Mary made a friend, Andre, ranked third in the school. But when Andre showed her his abilities, an accident happened. His powers went out of control and he accidentally injured a passerby. Seeing the trouble he had caused, Andre's friends immediately fled the scene. Looking at the injured person lying in a pool of blood, Mary was flooded with memories of her mother's tragic death.

Mary finally breathed a sigh of relief. Her act of saving the person went viral online. Overnight, Mary became a national icon. But the school didn't reward her. Instead, they expelled her, citing the incident with the injury. The school, in order to protect its reputation, Needed a scapegoat from those present, since Andre was a top three elite student, Mary became the sacrifice. Her blood control ability was deemed too ordinary in the professor's eyes. It had no value. She was completely disregarded. Mary was driven out of the university. Having lost her parents at a young age, now being expelled from school, Mary felt as if her life had lost all meaning. So Mary decided to prove herself to the professor one last time. But when she pushed open the professor's door, the sight that greeted her froze her in place.

Then I jumped into the sea to spear fish, thinking everything was under control. Little did I know this moment would make me regret it for the rest of my life. When the guy woke up and found his goggles gone, he flew into a rage and grabbed a spear ready to sink me. My wife grabbed the spear to stop him, but she was too weak. She couldn't hold it and even tore her clothes in the struggle. Seeing that the guy didn't hesitate, I came back full of fish and tossed the goggles to him. He should have been angry, but instead he seemed oddly pleased. I felt something was off, but I didn't think too much of it and proudly showed off my prize, just wanting to fill my stomach. Then I noticed my wife's eyes darting away and my chest tightened. He didn't say a word, and I started to realize the seriousness of the situation. I looked back at the guy next door and suddenly understood. Rage surged through me. I grabbed her and threw her in front of the guy, hoping she'd repent. But minutes later, to my shock, she and the guy were chillingly dancing together like nothing had happened. Seeing that, I turned green with anger. I couldn't stand it. I swore to myself they'd Pay for this. So I smashed a glass bottle, ground down the bottom, glued it to the neck, softened a plastic bottle over a flame, cut it open and sealed the mouth with black rubber, made a makeshift diving mask. I couldn't wait and dove in. Underwater was clearer than I expected. Excited, I planned to spear a few big fish to spite them. But then I spotted a sunken dinghy. It only had a small hole. Fixable. My mind lit up. Repair that boat and I could get off this island. I abandoned the fishing idea, took off the goggles and started hauling the boat. Walking in water is brutal. Pulling a boat heavier than me nearly exhausted me. I gasped for air, kept going, terrified the tide would wash it away. Finally I dragged the dinghy up onto shore. The guy saw it and seemed to realize this might be our way out. He ran over to help, but I barked at him to stop. He'd humiliated me before. Now he had the nerve to cozy up to me. No way. Days I worked on the boat dreaming of leaving the island. Then my wife came to apologize saying she did what she did to survive and begging me to take her when the boat was ready. I wasn't stupid. I didn't buy her one sided excuse and turned away in anger. Not long after, the boat was fixed and even had a sale. Seeing the guy busy I grabbed my spear, planning to catch a few more fish for provisions. But as soon as I hit the water, I sensed something was wrong. I surfaced and saw they had already loaded all their stuff into the dinghy. They were trying to steal my boat. Fury boiled over. I sprinted to the shore, trying to stop them, but it was too late. They pushed the boat into the water. I chased after them but couldn't catch up and could only roar on the beach watching them sail away. My anger strangely shifted to amusement. I lay back in my chair, ready to watch the show.

I froze in terror and quickly covered my mouth. But when I pulled my hand away, both my lips and hand are were covered in this sticky slime. Strangest thing happened during anatomy class. When the scalpel cut through my skin, I felt this sharp pain. When I tried again, the blade just fell off. I realized something was seriously wrong with my body. So I went to my cousin for help. When my cousin saw my tongue, he quickly pulled out some diagnostic paper and had me lie down for an exam. The results showed some kind of octopus like creature. It was parasitizing my intestines. As my cousin was about to operate, the octopus sensed the danger and started frantically migrating to other organs, forcing him to stop the surgery. I felt thirsty and went to get some water. That's when my cousin realized the octopus was aquatic. Without water, it would die. So he called in a water element wizard for help. The wizard used magic to extract the water from my body.

During anatomy class, the classroom went dark and the students faces turned purple. I started oozing purple liquid from my nose as if everyone was in danger. That's when my cousin showed up. He put everyone to sleep with hypnosis and then saved them. Turns out when dissecting the octopus, my cousin discovered it wasn't completely dead. There might be other octopuses still parasitizing my body. When I woke up, I saw my cousin's new scan and was shocked to discover another octopus had already settled in my brain.

I was 14 when I discovered I was deathly allergic to shellfish. We were at a family barbecue when someone brought shrimp skewers. Three bites in, my throat started closing. My lips swelled. Hives erupted across my arms. My cousin noticed first. Your neck, she said. Look at your neck. Red welts were crawling up from my collar. When I tried to call for help, my voice came out as a raspy whisper. My aunt found me collapsed against the sink. She screamed for my parents. Mom took one look and said, hospital now. We piled into the car, me in the backseat trying to remember how to breathe. Each inhale felt like sucking air through a coffee stirrer. We were maybe two miles from the hospital when my 11 year old sister piped up, can we stop at Starbucks? There's one right here. My vision was blurring and she wanted a Frappuccino. Not now, sweetie, mom said. But her voice was gentle. Negotiable, please, my sister whined. We're literally passing it. I tried to object but could only wheeze. Dad glanced at me in the rearview mirror. We have time, he said. She's still conscious. Still conscious. Those were the words he used to justify pulling into the Starbucks drive through while I was dying in the backseat. The line had six cars. Two minutes became four. Four became seven. My sister Ordered a venti caramel ribbon crunch with extra whipped cream. Mom reminded her to say please. Meanwhile, I was clawing at my throat, trying to force air into lungs that were sealing shut. The woman at the window noticed me. Is she okay? Just car sick, dad lied smoothly. When we finally pulled away, I'd lost feeling in my fingertips. The world was going gray. My sister took a long sip. Thanks, daddy, she said. Nine more minutes to the hospital. I spent them convinced I was going to die listening to her slurp her Starbucks. We screeched into the er bay. Within seconds, nurses surrounded us. I heard someone yell for an Epipen. The epinephrine hit my system like a defibrillator. A doctor leaned over me. You got here just in time, she said. Another few minutes and we'd be having a very different conversation. Just in time. We would have been there 10 minutes earlier if not for the Starbucks stop. But everyone was so relieved I was alive that no one wanted to talk about it. Later, my parents sat beside my hospital bed. We're so glad you're okay, mom said. We were terrified. My sister stood in the corner, still clutching her cup. She wouldn't make eye contact. The next day, they retold the story to relatives. We rushed her to the hospital, dad said. Didn't waste a single second. That was eight years ago. I'm 22 now and I carry two Epipens everywhere. I've had Three more severe allergic reaction since then, each time I drove myself to the hospital.

But my daughter did something that made him turn pale. It was Thanksgiving at his parents house and I should have known better than to show up with store bought dinner rolls. For eight years of marriage to Derek, I had Learned that everything had to be perfect in front of his family or there would be consequences later. But I had been pulling 12 hour shifts at the hospital all week and barely had time to shower, let alone bake homemade bread. His mother, Patricia, made the first comment. As I set the plastic container on her perfectly set dining table, she lifted one roll with her manicured fingers like it might contaminate her entire meal. Well, she said loud enough for the entire room to hear. I suppose not everyone has time for family traditions anymore. 22 family members were crammed into that dining room. His parents, both brothers with their wives, six kids ranging from toddlers to teenagers, and various aunts and uncle who had driven in from neighboring towns. All of them turned to stare at me like I had committed some unforgivable sin. I forced a smile and explained that I had been working overtime at the hospital. Three nurses had called in sick with the flu and someone had to cover the emergency department. I thought they would understand. His father was a retired police officer. His Brothers worked construction. They knew about demanding jobs. But Derek's face was already turning that familiar shade of red that meant trouble was coming. His jaw clenched the way it always did when he thought I had embarrassed him. The vein in his temple started throbbing. You always have an excuse, he said, loudly enough to cut through every conversation in the room. The football game on TV suddenly seemed too loud. Someone's fork clinked against their plate. One of the toddlers asked for more juice, but nobody moved to help him. All eyes were on us now. I'm not making excuses, I said as calmly as I could manage. I'm explaining why I didn't have time to bake this week. That's when he hit me. The slap echoed through the dining room like a gunshot. My cheek exploded in pain, and I could taste blood where my teeth had cut the inside of my lip. The force of it knocked me sideways, and I had to grab the back of a chair to keep from falling. Complete silence fell over the room. Not one person moved. Not one person spoke. His father stared at his plate like it held the secrets of the universe. His mother suddenly developed an intense interest in folding and refolding her napkin. His brothers exchanged a quick glance, but immediately looked away. Even the children had gone completely quiet. Don't you ever embarrass me like that again, Derek hissed through clenched teeth. That's when My 16 year old daughter Chloe stood up from the kids table in the corner. She had been living with us for two years since her father died in a motorcycle accident. Derek had never liked her, always complained that she was too mouthy, too independent, too much like me for his taste. She walked over slowly, deliberately, pulling her phone out of her back pocket as she moved. When she reached where Derek was standing, she held it up and aimed it directly at his face. Smile, she said with this.

Entonces, un día, una pulga hembra se le acercó para demostrar su caballerosidad innata. La pulga se quitó la chaqueta y la extendió como una alfombra. Al gesto tan cortés le valió un beso al instante. Aprovechando el momento, le preguntó, ¿quieres casarte conmigo? Sí, me casaré contigo, mi pequeño murciélago. Fascinante. ¿Cuántas veces te ha mordido un murciélago? No, no no como víctima, sino como la atracción principal del circo. Cada día llegaban multitudes con lupas para verlos. Justo en el clímax del espectáculo, un perro callejero entró por casualidad. El circo quedó en completo silencio. Todas las pulgas salieron en estampida, corriendo desenfrenadas hacia el perro. El pobre perro casi se orinó del susto. Media vuelta de inmediato, pero tropezó y cayó. Las pulgas aprovecharon para anidar en su pelaje. El perro se sentía terriblemente incómodo. Para aliviar la picazón, se lanzó al agua de un salto y así toda la familia de pulgas encontró su fin. Al ver a su amada en peligro, la pulga ejecutó su técnica de pasos veloces, rescatándola entre sus brazos con éxito. Aprendiendo la lección del pasado, la pulga decidió marcharse para evitar un nuevo abandono. Pero la hembra se había enamorado del héroe salvador y en ese mismo instante decidió entregarle su corazón. Por fin, la pulga consiguió pareja. Pronto celebraron su boda en una iglesia solemne. Caminaron juntos por la Alfombra roja para siempre. Pasaron dos días y medio. Al regresar a casa encontró a su esposa tejiendo un suéter. Era para el bebé que pronto nacería. Llegó la fecha del parto. Esperaba ansioso fuera de la sala, fumando sin parar. Para calmar los nervios, caray una cesta llena de pulguitas. Dos minutos después salían del hospital negras como una plaga de langostas a mantener a la familia. Volvieron al circo, donde el dueño sufría por la falta de artistas. Al llegar las pulgas cerraron. Trato de inmediato. En un instante formaron una fila con sus noventa y nueve hijos para la función. El circo renació. El dueño ganaba manos llenas después de cada espectáculo. Al volver al camerino, descubrió a su esposa tejiendo otra vez. Zumba no, zumba no

Whenever the landlord came to collect, he would instantly switch his mansion into a slum. The mouse pretended to be a blind street performer, begging for money, earning a decent daily income, which made other beggars jealous and often LED them to steal from him. After a busy day, the mouse continued acting as a blind man. On his way home, he would observe his surroundings, making sure no one was following before he dared to open the door. Because inside the room was incredibly luxurious, even with a butler, the mouse entered the dressing room and put on a globally limited edition suit. His greatest hobby every day was opening layer after layer of safes to pull out the stinky socks inside. As he reveled in the joy of counting money, a sharp knock on the door startled him. It was the landlord coming to demand two and a half years of overdue rent. The mouse immediately put the gold back in the safe and bought all the luxury furniture for rickety, broken pieces. Once everything was ready, he acted poor, claiming he hadn't eaten in three days and even asking the landlord for a little money. The landlord, seeing the dilapidated state of the house, believed him. The landlord pulled out the Bill. The mouse noticed a gold coin on the table and quickly hit it. As the house started calculating the charges, the mouse sat down. On a stool which suddenly rotated 360 degrees, the landlord panicked and accidentally pressed a switch. Thinking the mouse was up to tricks, he watched in horror as all the furniture malfunctioned and began flipping uncontrollably. Terrified landlord fled the room, only to run into a black cat outside. The landlord ran away immediately and the black cat, holding a gold coin in its mouth, tricked the mouse. Unaware, the mouse fell for it, and just like that, he became the black cat's dinner.
