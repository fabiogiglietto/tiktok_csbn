Johnson to prevent discrimination in government employment and advance racial equality. The newly signed executive orders to end ‚Äúillegal discrimination‚Äù and restore ‚Äúmerit to government service‚Äù were so sweeping and aggressive that even conservative activists ‚Äî ones who had been waging a multipronged attack to end diversity initiatives in the private and public sectors ‚Äî were shocked by their scope and intensity. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs going this far,‚Äù said Dan Lennington, deputy counsel at the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, which for years has led a relentless legal campaign to invalidate diversity programs. ‚ÄúIt still is sinking in, because I‚Äôm thinking of all the ways in which this affects the average American.‚Äù Union leaders and labor advocates have decried the move, with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission‚Äôs three Democratic members saying in a joint statement that rescinding the 1965 order will remove ‚Äúa source of protection against discrimination for the millions of Americans working for companies that receive federal dollars.‚Äù",,"Trump signed these orders to end DEI programs. What does that mean? Trump ordered US diversity offices to close and workers to be put on administrative leave. Government contracting programs aimed at minorities and women, some of which have been operating for decades, have been suspended. I see a memo from secretary of State Marco Rubio told State Department officials they'd face adverse consequences if they failed to report colleagues who concealed existing DEI programs in the department. But this just affects government jobs? Nope. Educational agencies and universities have been told they have to comply with the SCOTUS decision to ban race conscious admission. Ant Trump also told federal agency heads to find public companies to investigate over their D I. Policies. What does that mean? Publicly traded companies. Also non profits with asset over 500 million, universities with endowments over billion. Those kinds of works. Where's this coming from? Technically speaking? Lyndon B. Johnson's executive order from 1965. It directed federal contractors to take affirmative action to end discrimination at their firms. Trump revoked that order, in fact.

In an earnings call, the company announced annual operating income for 2024 that exceeded $10 billion for the first time in its history, on the back of year-on-year revenue growth of 16 percent. Netflix gained 19 million paid subscribers in the fourth quarter of the year ‚Äî buoyed, it said, in part by the recent release of the second season of ‚ÄúSquid Game‚Äù and its push into live sports, including NFL games and the internet-viral boxing match between Mike Tyson and YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul. Story by: Kelly Kasulis Cho",,"Netflix is an OG in the streaming space. I mean, they used to send DVDs to your house. Wild times. So when they do anything new, even if it's content or mobile games, I like to stick my head around the corner and say what's the, uh, what's the world's biggest streamer up to? Now their prices are going up. Oh, for the ad supported model, the price is going from 6 99 to 7 99, the standard subscription is going from 1549 to 1799, and the most expensive tier is now 2499, which is a two dollar increase. And here are some pricing for some of Netflix's largest competitors. it looks like their ad supported model falls somewhere in the middle. Like not as expensive as HBO Max, but more money than Paramount Plus and Peacock. Also, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post now. In an earnings call, Netflix says it gained 41 million subscribers in 2024 and 19 million of those came in Q4 alone. The company largely credits Squid game Season 2 and live events like the NFL games and the Mike Tyson versus Jake Paul boxing match. No mention of arcane Season 2. A travesty in my opinion. Now Netflix also says the crackdown on password sharing, making an add to your model, and their boo Reagan to mobile gaming has made the company more valuable. Netflix can be ahead of the industry wide curve. Like take originals for example. The idea that a streaming Service, not a movie studio was going to make their own TV shows and movies was unheard of before Netflix did it. So what Netflix does can be a precursor for what the rest of the industry is about to do.

Here are some of them. Ending birthright citizenship in the US. This means no longer recognizing the citizenship of kids born in the US to immigrants who lack legal status or weren't people in temporary work, student, or tourist visas. Is he allowed to make executive orders doing that? Yes, but Congress and courts can potentially block executive orders, so many of Trump's orders are expected to be challenged. Challenged in court, which would slow them down or cause them not to be implemented at all. For example, a bunch of states and civil rights groups have already filed legal challenges against Trump's citizenship order, so it's unlikely to go into effect next month. Okay, then how is an executive order different from a law? Executive orders are like laws, but they only require the president to be enacted. That's why they're not always long lasting. They can be easily revoked by another president. Laws have to be introduced in Congress, pass the house, the Senate, and get signed by the president. Do you have an example? Sure. Trump just withdrew the US from the Paris climate agreement. But the US just rejoined, right? The Trump administration withdrew the US in 2020, Biden rejoined in 2021, and Trump just withdrew again, all via executive action. I see. Trump also signed actions withdrawing the US from the World Health Organization, legally recognizing only Two sexes. The ones assigned at conception. And rescinding the 78 executive actions from the Biden administration. Any other actions? Yes, but we run out of time because

Even a 10-minute nap can have profound effects on our cognition and mood in addition to alleviating afternoon slumps.Even ‚Äúshort naps can be restorative,‚Äù said Michael Chee, the director of the Center for Sleep and Cognition at the National University of Singapore.",,"There's a secret I just have to get off my chest. I love naps. I mean, when I sleep during the day, it is the napageddon. I'm Cleonaputra. Leonardo Dinaprio. But did you know they can actually be good for you? Go on. See, according to sleep researchers at the university of Singapore, even a short nap can be restorative. Oh, I can't come to the phone right now. I'm restoring vigilance, memory, and mental processing. And you're learning, huh? You just get me. Now, there's an important distinction between what scientists would call a nap and just an unplanned sleep. Like, a nap is anywhere between 20 to 30 minutes and is associated with those positive health outcomes. Or an unplanned sleep could just be you falling asleep on the couch for an hour. And are associated with negative outcomes. No, I wasn't asleep. I was just resting my eyes, giving the peepers a break. Now, this is all because of something called sleep inertia. It's what propels you into the deep sleep part of the sleep cycle. See, right here is where you would be for a nap. And if you go past this point, scientists say you just complete the entire 90 minute sleep cycle. So if you suddenly stop your sleep inertia, scientists say you could wake up feeling groggy and disoriented. You know what? That is an excellent point. I'm going on do not disturb and setting this alarm for 90 minutes.

It was a powerful sign of the role of wealth under the 47th president. Under the next administration, technology CEOs and founders stand to grow their riches even more, as Trump promises to steer resources to favorites and offers up a personal approach to who gets what. Trump, meanwhile, will get the legitimacy he always craved but sometimes felt he didn‚Äôt receive during his first term in office, as the most powerful people in the global economy flock to do business with him. The gathering of the wealthy behind Trump led to some dissonant moments as the newly inaugurated president declared that he would upend the global trading system that enabled people like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ‚Äî who also owns The Washington Post ‚Äî to become titans of modern society. ‚ÄúI will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,‚Äù Trump declared, hinting at erecting trade barriers that would imperil Musk‚Äôs business interests in China and Apple CEO Tim Cook‚Äôs ability to source parts for iPhones from around the world. But the applause came anyway.¬† Caption from article by Michael Birnbaum¬†and¬†Cat Zakrzewski.",,"Excuse me, could you help me? I have amnesia and I don't remember the last four years. Sure. So we're in DC, and many of Trump's supporters are in the capital right now. Still. They're not breaking in this time, though. The January 6th rioters are getting a full pardon from. Wait, so what's going on? This is Trump's inauguration. Yeah. Re elected. Yes. And this is the overflow audience in Capital One Arena because it was too cold to have it outside. Who's that guy? That's TikTok CEO. So TikTok is banned right now? Sort of. So Trump finally banned it? No, he's the one trying to unban it. He signed in an executive order that they won't enforce the ban for another 75 days. Can he do that? It's legally dubious, but Trump's ultimate goal is for the U. S. To have a joint venture in TikTok with bite dance. I guess, but it's banned. Yeah. In fact, the TikTok CEO is sitting right by the Google and Apple CEOs. Both of their companies are too afraid to host TikTok on their app stores because they could get fined. Is that Jeff Bezos? Sure is. And he's sitting near Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Collectively, they're worth almost a trillion dollars. Zuckerberg's here too? I thought Facebook banned Trump. They unbanned him. So did Twitter. And Elon owns Twitter now. Twitter? No. X oh look, Elon's waving at us! I'm not sure he's waving.

Her films have made over $14.5 billion. We're talking about Scarlett Johansson, who was the highest paid actress worldwide in 2,018 and 2,019. Was she married to Ryan Reynolds? Yes, she was. Did they divorce? Because he met Blake Lively on the set of Green Lantern and they had a thing. Unclear. They deny it, but the circumstances are very much giving. Brad, Jen and Angelina. Scarlett Johansson was born on November 22nd, 1984, in New York. She's a Sagittarius. Her mother's name is Melanie. Her father's name is Carsten. From this marriage, Scarlett has three siblings. An older sister who's also an actress. Her name is Vanessa. An older brother named Adrian. A younger brother by three minutes named hunter. Because they're twins, we often see hunter on the red carpet with Scarlett. Scarlett has talked about growing up in New York. Her family was not well off. From a young age, Scarlett always knew she wanted to be a performer. She would dance and act in front of her family. Scarlett did not play around. She was studying her craft from the age of seven. She would pop up in projects here and there. Did you know she was a child actress? She got tons of attention cause she was in a film called The Horse Whisperer, directed by and starring Robert Redford. She did that film when she was 13. Critics loved her performance. But she's growing up, so she Starts taking more mature roles like lost in translation and The Girl with a Pearl Earring. I had to add this picture with destiny's child. Look at baby Beyonce. While in high school, Scarlet was dating Jack Antonoff. They went to prom together. If Jack's name sounds familiar, it should. He's a singer songwriter, producer, often working with Taylor Swift, among many others. And we know the connection here because Taylor and Blake are besties. Isn't this industry so tiny? Scarlett and Jack were an item for about a year and some change. A couple of years later, Scarlett is in a film called The Black Dahlia, co starring Josh Hartnett. They become an item and they dated for about two years. A few months later, she's spotted with actor Ryan Reynolds. When they were dating, she was about 23, he was 31. They got married in September 2008. I find it interesting that there is no red carpet photo of this couple, but they were both on SNL, which is funny cause that circles back as well. She's steadily working. She releases an album. She works with Woody Allen a few times, which is ironic cause that circles back a little bit later. Ryan starts filming Green Lantern early 2,010, co starring Blake Lively. Blake had been dating her Gossip Girl co star Penn Badgley. But in October 2,010, these two broke up. Two months later, December 2,010, Scarlett and Ryan announced that they're separated. These two appear at the red Carpet in June 2,011. Scarlett and Ryan's divorce is finalized the the very next month. A year later, these two get married on a plantation. Later, Blake also works with Woody Allen and says it's empowering. See how it all circles back? A year later, she begins to date Roman Duriack. Together, they have a daughter they named rose. They get married later that same year. Couple of years later, they separate. They're divorced in 2,017. She begins dating Colin Jost later that same year. He's from SNL and they are very cute together. They're engaged in 2,019. They get married in 2020. The next year, they have their son, Cosmo. I love these two together. Personally, I take him over the other one any day of the week. Scarlett Johansson she's cute, she's rich, she's unbothered, and I'd rather have her on my screen any day, too.

He was 6 3. Gary Cooper is the cat's meow, and he's often regarded as one of the best actors of the golden era of Hollywood. Coop is known for his rugged good looks, his fashion. He had an understated acting style, he was chill, and he had effortless charisma. Gary Cooper starred in over 80 films, starting in the silent era and then transitioning to talkies. He won two Academy Awards for Best Actor and he received an honorary Oscar. Frank James Cooper was born on May 7th, 19 0 1 in Montana. He was a Taurus. His parents were immigrants from England. His father, Charles, was a lawyer, rancher, and Montana Supreme Court justice. His mother's name was Alice, and he had an older brother named Arthur. His mom wanted him to have a British education, so from the age of 8 to 11, he and his brother lived in England. He grew up in Montana outdoors, and this essentially shaped his on screen persona of being rugged and all American. He had a brief stint in college studying art, but when his parents moved to LA, Coop joined them. He met some old friends who were working as extras, so he joined them and then he worked as a stuntman and then he moved on up. He started working in silent films and he was a sensation. Around this time, he started dating actress Clara Bow. Her Influence got him one of his first leading roles. He was a bonafide silent film actor. He started dating his co star Evelyn Brent. And then he starred in a film with Lupe Velez, and they began to date. This was tumultuous, and Lupe would f this man up. And if you saw my previous video about Lupe, you know this woman was stressing this man out. During this time, coop was hanging with an actor named Anderson Lawlor. And Lupe said they had a thing going on. She spilled all of his business to the queen of gossip, Heta Hopper, saying that she would sniff him to see if he smelled like the man's Cologne. Lupe said she didn't mind as long as she could join. Now, is this all true? I don't know. But some people think Gary Cooper was bi. But let me tell you, this man had some female conquests. There was his co star Marlena Dietrich, Carol Lombard. He had an affair with Countess Dorothy de Frazay. It must have been her title. In 1933, he married his wife, Veronica. She was a New York debutante, very wealthy. His friends would say this marriage was very good for coop because he was so used to drama in his relationships. Together they had a daughter, Maria Veronica Cooper, who was born in 1937. They say he was an excellent father. He was faithful to his wife until about nine years later, when he began an affair with His co star Ingrid Bergman. This affair lasted about a year. A few years later, he had another affair with actress Patricia Neill. And these two had a very open affair. His wife saw all the press and confronted him and he was like, yes, I love Patricia. So they separated. Later, Patricia alleged that she went out on a date with Kirk Douglas and coop hit her. She also said that he forced her to have a schmemorshin. Anyway, they broke up. He was separated for about three years. And some people said he may or may not have dated Grace Kelly. In 1954, Gary Cooper and his wife Veronica reconciled once again. They were a happy family. He was very close to his daughter Maria. In 1960, Gary Cooper Learned he had prostate cancer. Later that year, he found out that the cancer spread to his lungs and his bones. On May 13th, 1961, Gary Cooper passed away peacefully. It was just over a week after his 60th birthday. He was an icon. He was dreamy. Why don't people dress like this anymore

It started off strong, and then it appeared that she was Team Blake. You just know her team knows more tea. I'm sure none of the actors want to say anything on record because this whole entire lawsuit. Is so messy. The assistants are the real MVP.

The press famously dubbed her ‚ÄòThe Mexican Spitfire. üé¨‚≠êÔ∏è #entertainment #oldhollywood #celebrity #lupevelez #vintage #mexican #immigrant #america ,,"This gorgeous woman was one of the first Mexican American actresses to make it big in Hollywood. Lupe Velez was an actress in the golden era of Hollywood. They called her the Mexican Spitfire because of a series of films she did. But let's face it, Hollywood was. Is racist. So they gave her some stereotypical names. Hot tamale, senorita cyclone, whoopee loopee, you know, stereotypical. Not only was she well known for her on screen performances, but her personal life was a bit tumultuous. Lupe took her own life at the age of just 36. Lupe loved, and she loved hard. And she had some jealous tendencies. In the press, she was often pit against fellow Mexican American actress Dolores Del Rio. Dolores was mostly cast in what they called the classy roles, where Lupe's roles were considered to be more fiery and vivacious. Because Lupe knew how to work the press, she would often make comments about Dolores, igniting a public feud, if you will. They say personally, they respected each other, but make no mistake, Lupe was drama, and she liked to get into some tussles. As the story goes, she auditioned for Douglas Fairbanks. He told her to take off her shoes. She was like, I'm not taking off my shoes. Started screaming at him. He cast her in the film. Not long after, he started thumping her pom pom. She was linked to Charlie Chaplin because who wasn't? Clark Gable. Look at those ears. Tom Binks. Who reminds me of Cal Worthington and his dog spot. And most notably, Gary Cooper, who, yes, I know, is a Viking. These two were together for about three years, and it was intense. They loved hard, they fought hard. He was paddling in her gingham when they argued. It got wild. We're talking chasing Gary around in a kitchen with a. And him needing stitches. There are stories that she showed up to a train station with a pew pew, although many people say this was greatly exaggerated. She had beef with Marlena Dietrick, as she should, because there were rumors that Marlena and Carrie were playing rumpy pumpy in between takes. The point is, it was toxic. He was so stressed out, he was losing weight. And when Lupe met his mother, his mother was like, uh, uh, dumper. After their breakup, she dated a few people. Then she met Johnny Weissmuller, the actor who played Tarzan. These two got married, but again, it was dramatic. They would get into it at premieres and nightclubs. She even talked about how she would clock them from time to time. Their makeup artist often had to cover up bruises and hickeys. This marriage lasted about six years. In between all of that, Lupe would be throwing hands with other women. She got into a fist fight with Lillian and Tashman at a club. She threatened to Norma Shearer. Lupe and Libby Holman were in a musical together and would often Get into tussles backstage. Lupe did not back down. In 1944, Lupe met a struggling actor named Harold Merris. They began a relationship. They soon found out that they were expecting. One night on December 13th, 1944, Lupe was hanging out with some girlfriends. When she got back home later that night, Lupe took 75 pills and washed it down with a glass of brandy. Her assistant discovered her in her bed the next morning. Beside her was a note addressed to Harold. And it read in part, to Harold, may god forgive you and forgive me too. I prefer to take me and the baby before he grows up in the life of shame. How could you, Harold, create such fake love for me and the baby when you didn't want us? The day after she passed, Harold spoke to the press and he said he was so confused because, yes, they were broken up, but he had proposed to her. Lupe was only 36 when this happened. Everyone was shocked and stunned. And of course, there were conspiracy theories. Some people believed that the baby was Gary Cooper's and that she was trying to protect him. Gary was married and it could ruin his career. Here's a picture of Lupe and her then husband Johnny, and Gary and his wife Veronica. So, so sad right now. I found some pictures of Lupita and her adopted daughter concita, who apparently was her sister's child. Now, her biographies make no mention of This girl. So I don't know if it was a photo op or if she did indeed adopt her. And may I just say, Lupita's journey from Mexico to Hollywood is a powerful reminder of the indelible impact immigrants have had and continue to have in shaping American culture.

Sorry, but this girl just keeps digging herself into a hole that I cannot dig her out of. This behind the scenes footage of them filming a very romantic scene, and in the scene, it is very apparent that Blake Lively is very comfortable and almost a little bit flirtatious. Just watch without you. This could have been well before he did something that made her feel uncomfortable. I'm not saying that sh did not happen on the set of this movie, but as new evidence becomes available, it is much harder to be on Blake Lively side. And I am still trying. I think one of the final straws for me, honestly, was when this text message from Blake Lively was released. She basically referred to herself as Khaleesi and implied that Ryan Reynolds and Taylor Swift are her dragons. Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of either of them. So I'm really curious how this is gonna play out in court. And I'm really waiting for the trial to form any concrete opinions about this. But let me know what you guys think in the comments and what do you think of that footage?

That particular cup features Cool Chuck, which ended around 2004, which is actually when I started working at Chuck E. Cheese. He was replaced with Avenger Chuck, who lived up until 2012 when they completely redid him into Rockstar Chuck. I remember how I said this cup was from 2012, but that doesn't make any sense because they stopped making cool Chuck eight years previous to this, and in 2012 they were switching to a completely new Chuck E. Cheese design entirely. And it might be hard to see, but the tagline says where kids rule. Registered trademark. That is also extremely strange because everybody knows the Chuck E. Cheese tagline is where a kid can be a kid. Now, I searched through all of C E C. Entertainment's live and dead trademarks. Nowhere in there is where kids rule. So we have an outdated Chuck E. Cheese topper and a tagline that was registered that was never actually registered that I could see. What does it mean? I know what you're thinking. Maybe they just kept using that Chuck design. Maybe it's not really a big deal, but this was the cup that they issued in 2011, so they were using the appropriate Chuck E. Cheese model by this period of time. This was the cup design in 2006, so yes, the model did carry over a little bit while they were transitioning between the two. But even back then, they Knew if you're gonna do a bendy straw of any kind, you run the pipe up through his body and up through his arm, and then do the bend far away from his torso. So what actually happened? So here's my conspiracy theory on why this bizarre anomaly of a cop exists in the first place. When they completely ditched this Chuck E. Cheese model. Not just the cool Chuck, but the Avenger Chuck, too. In favor?

Cheese cup at the goodwill bins when I was thrifting the other day and I wanted to tell you about it. And this is not me calling it inappropriate, this is just the general rumblings of why they stopped making this cup in particular. Killer. I personally just think it's funny. So this is a promo cup? You can upgrade to a promo cup anytime you buy a drink at Chuck E. Cheese. They always have some sort of plastic promo cup going on. This is what a typical Chuck E. Cheese promo cup looks like. It's usually either a full body chuck or they used to do heads a lot. Stuff like this. Oregon usually just a head. I'm gonna show you why this is considered inappropriate and why they stopped making it. But then I also have a conspiracy theory I wanna share with you. So this Chuck looks kind of old, right? If you looked at this cup, you'd think it was from like the 90s and 2, but it was actually made in 2012. Which will feed into my conspiracy theory, but we're not there yet. So anyway, this cup screws on and off. It's got a topper. When you screw, chuck all the way in the hole lands at the back. And Chuck E. Cheese only serves straight straws. They don't have bendy straws. So if you put a straw in him, this is how it's supposed to work. It's a normal cup, right? So the trouble comes when you can just unscrew him or twist him around to the back. And if you get him home and you have a kid and you use a bendy straw, which makes a lot more sense than trying to drink like that, you use a bendy straw. Oh, look at that, look at that. Look at him looking at you while you're trying to drink out of a straw there. Cause they don't have bendy straws. They didn't realize that at the restaurant level. And once they figured out what people were doing with this cup, they sent whoopsie and they stopped making it. Which is actually why this cup is a little bit hard to find. But.

Because the answers that I gave him, he tried to find out cheaper or other ways to do it, saying that I just don't think it's really worth a couple thousand dollars to get my future spouse to come here.

All right, Reba. So, uh, question. Sure. Why are so many lawyers afraid of fighting associations like homeowners associations? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Seems like it's not that they're scared to fight them, it's that they're not profitable. So. I don't think you realize how expensive lawyers are. Like, they charge anywhere between, like, 150 to 500 dollars an hour for their work. Right? A lot of attorneys, if they're doing, like, you know, pay by the hour things, then they're charging an hourly rate, but they're doing it for a service. So there's a predetermined end period. If you come to me for a will, right? I know it's gonna take me three hours to write you a will. I say it's gonna be $300 an hour. I know I'm spending nine hours making your will. I'm sitting three hours making your will, making 900 bucks. Maybe I spend four hours. If you have questions or we go over something. Right, but if you're trying to fight, like, a homeowners association or something like that, and you're trying to sue them for either specific performance, as in you want them to do something or an enforcement to get them to, like, pay you money for something, right. Generally those claims are small. Like your fight. You know, the homeowners association came by and, um, painted my garage, and it's $1,000 to paint it back. Okay, well, are you gonna pay the Lawyer $1,000 to get him to get the homeowners association to give you $1,000 back? Probably not.

That's how the jury is presented to them, right? You think you're gonna give me money? Correct. But. Okay, if I get a judgment against you, then the insurance company will pay that judgment as long as that amount is within the policy limits that you have. So if I get a. If I sue you and you've got $50,000 insurance, and then the jury gives me $100,000, I get 50 grand from your insurance, and then you gotta come up with the other 50 grand.

And they will send the sheriff out to their door, knock on the door, hand them a copy of that paperwork, and then they've got 30 days to respond and deny. And if they don't deny, you automatically win. Uh, and if they do respond and deny, Then about 30 days after that, y'all will show up in court, and you'll say, your honor, I gave John Q. Smith ten grand, and he was supposed to pay me back according to these terms. He hasn't given me a dime. And then that person will respond to the judge, if it's exactly as you say it is, the judge gonna say, well, you gotta pay her back. He'll bang his little gavel. And then. Well, you can then get a piece of paper, and you can go to his employer. His employer will take cash out his check and give it to you. That's the part I don't have. Self employed. Okay, if he's self employed, he has an employer. Yeah, he's damn self. No, he. Someone's giving him money. He's an entrepreneur. Like, he has a store and stuff like he. Okay, people are giving him money. There's a revenue source. Right. So if he had an employee, money coming in, so. Yeah. So if I. If he was. If he worked for, like, you know, X, Y, Z widget company, you would give them that paperwork, they would pull the money out of his check. Just like withholdings. Like child support? Yeah, just like child support. Right. But if he doesn't have a regular income like that, but got a bank, you go to the bank and you say, this is my judgment. He claims to not have any income, and the bank will sort it. Out. Like, here's the thing. Shady people don't like to expose themselves to for further and additional scrutiny. Like the minute the sheriff shows up and gives him a piece of paper that says, you have 30 days to show up in court, he'll probably call you back. Yeah, he'll probably call you back. Like it? Thanks for stopping by. Absolutely. Follow me on.

Like, think logically here. Like, I talk with my hands. I'm Latina, I'm Brazilian. Like, I use my hands a lot. I understand that it can make people uncomfortable, and for that I apologize. Like, if it made Jacardi uncomfortable, like, I'm sorry if you're seeing this and him pushing. I honestly didn't notice. And you can see in the video, I just continue talking, because to me, like, if I was doing something romantically, I would be like, ah, you would have been upset. I would have been upset about it. And I literally was not upset about it at all. Like, I completely understand. It was, like, I should understand that some people don't want to be touched when I'm, you know, just having a conversation, and I'll be mindful of that. But making it this whole big thing, like, we hooked up three years ago. It was not that big of a deal. Like, it's just not that deep.

If you wanted to not do anything to me, then you could have just handled it off social media. But instead, you decide to just be petty along with Julia and take this out not only on me, but Ayesha, who. Who you claim to be is blood. If you can do that to blood, you can do that to anybody. At the end of the day, you're asking, what did I do to you? Look right the next to you. That's what you did to me. And since there's no loyalty lying between here, I took loyalty on this side. You clearly weren't gonna be loyal to me after you took Julia. So, yes, I smashed a cake in your face. And I do it the again because it's loyalty. End of story.

And she looks at me with curiosity because she wants to know why she feels that. So I asked her what the word pathetic means to her first, and she says, stupid, I guess. So I asked her to close her eyes and track where she feels the sensation, the thought arising from in her body when she sees or imagines pictures a light up unicorn outfit. And she does. And then we go into that sensation, and I asked her the first thing she's seeing or remembering, what's coming up for her in her mind. And she says, uh, my fourth birthday party, it was a unicorn themed, and she had a light up unicorn outfit on. Now, this birthday party was held at one of our empty restaurants that we had used for catering at the time, and our family had recently used it for a memorial event for one of the grandfather's passing in our family. Then I asked her what she was remembering about the birthday party. She remembered seeing Poppy's pictures all over the place. And so she asked her grandmother where Poppy went. And her grandmother said, he went over the Rainbow Bridge to heaven. And while we were sitting there on the couch remembering this together, and she was processing this feeling, she had Emotions coming up with it. Emotions that she never really got to process about Poppy and his passing because she was in the middle of a birthday party with a bunch of people there all begging for her attention. She had no idea past, but I don't think she fully got it until she was looking at those pictures. And in that moment, holding such a big loss while simultaneously celebrating her birthday in a little unicorn outfit somehow made the childhood things feel pathetic. Yesterday she got to feel those feelings and process them on the couch with me. Guess who doesn't think little rainbow unicorn costumes are pathetic anymore?

Reese, your mugshot is online for you giving minors alcohol. Don't know why. What is it? You can't get sober? Speaking of minors, uh, don't you have a son? Where. Where is he? Are you not gonna take care of him? Like, what are you doing? And third of all, please stop sending every single one of your exes N D A's, because the stories they have told me about how you exploit them and the things that you've done to them is disgusting, and you genuinely deserve to be in jail. Okay? So hopefully you don't raise your son to abuse women and just treat them horribly and then just throw an NBA in a cease and desist at them. I'm done talking about all of you. Like, you suck. Y'all are terrible people, and that's that. Okay? So be better. It's 20 20, Five. I'm done talking about y'all. And genuinely, I mean this. You can all go fuck yourselves.

I feel like I'm in between a rock and a hard place. But I do appreciate you telling me the truth. You know, I do love Tom, but he needs to come clean and apologize about All of this, or I don't think we'll be able to repair our relationship at all. I mean, I'm marrying Eddie. He punched him in the face. It just isn't right. I agree. I'm gonna talk to him. She goes home and she confronts Tom. So I talked to your cousin Allison today. Why would you talk to her after she uninvited us from her wedding? Well, you know about that. She told me what happened at the poker game the other night.

I did. This is just a courtesy call. You know, we went under new management, we got a new system, and we made just a little mistake, so we wanted to bring it to your attention. Okay, well, this isn't a little mistake. I booked the venue 10 months ago with exclusive use. So what do you guys plan to do about this mistake you made? Well, we have a couple of really great options for you to consider. The first is you could have any available date this calendar year or next calendar year for a small rebooking fee of $500. Sorry, um, you made a mistake. I'm not paying to pick a new date. I will be sticking with my original date. Okay, I thought you might say that. So we have two other great options. You could get married in the morning for exclusive use, or you could get married in the outside barn, and the other couple will get married in the inside ballroom. No and no. I will not be doing either of those things. What do you mean you won't be doing any of those things? Those are the only options. Or you can go off the couple that booked first, which I know was me, because I booked before the management changed up. And you can let the other couple know that you made a very Large mistake. And let them choose a new date. The thing is, they actually paid more than you. There it is. It is not my problem that you raised your prices. I booked the fee that was offered to me 10 months ago, and I paid in full. Well, I just don't know what you want me to do. I'm gonna come down there and meet with your manager.

I mean, I wouldn't call it a real apology. It was a text that said, sorry for drinking too much. Didn't address Eddie. Didn't address his inappropriate behavior. So why is he under the impression that he's invited to the wedding? Because that's how Tom is. But you're hearing it from me, the person who's getting married. He is not invited. Even if he does a real apology, I still wouldn't invite him. Hopefully one day we can make amends and he can be back in my life, but for now, we aren't doing that. I totally understand. I would do the same. Allison confronts Tom again, and it opens up a whole other can of worms. They end up separating. This is two months later. One month before the wedding. Allison, I'm so glad you asked me to help with the centerpieces. Of course, I know you and Tom are going your separate ways, but we absolutely love you, and I'm really glad you're deciding to come to the wedding. Same. I wouldn't miss it. And you'll never guess what Eddie told me. What? We have a mutual friend that we invited to the wedding. This mutual friend knows Tom. Of course. We gave her a plus one, but her and her boyfriend broke up. Okay, where's this going? Tom asked her if he could be her plus one. You're joking. No. We're hiring security for the wedding. I wouldn't put it past Tom to Show up to the wedding? Sadly, me neither.

Well, if you didn't write it and send it to me, then who did? I'm pretty sure Tom did to try to cover up the poker night situation. But why would he wanna be uninvited from your wedding? He doesn't wanna be uninvited. He was uninvited. We made that abundantly clear. I know you guys have only been married, like, a year, but this is a typical Tom stunt. I'm sorry. I'm just so confused. What happened at poker night? So Tom was drinking a little more than usual, and he started making jokes about Eddie. Okay, you know Tom likes to make fun. Where's the harm in that? But it wasn't normal jokes. They were crossing the line. Talking about Tom's heritage, where his family's from, below the belt. Why would Tom do that? Eddie's such a great guy. I think Tom's true colors were showing. Basically, Eddie Asked him to stop several times, and Tom just kept going and going and going. Eddie finally got up and asked him to leave if he was gonna continue to be disrespectful, and that's when Tom punched him in the face. What? Yeah. Then he tried to get in his car and flee the situation.

Can we just move on with our day? You promise you know nothing. Stop meddling, Trisha. I'm headed to work. I'll see you later. Trisha decides to call his cousin. Her name is Allison. Hmm. Voicemail. Hey, Allison, it's Trisha. Just hoping that I could connect with you. Sad to hear you had a downsize for the wedding, but I still hope you have a beautiful day. She immediately gets a text back from Allison. Hey, Trisha. Surprised to see you calling after everything that went down. I'm gonna be honest, Allison. I literally have no clue what you're talking about. I asked Tom, and he said he also doesn't know. You're joking, right? No, I've asked him twice now. Lisa also said Tom should fill me in on the situation, but he is playing dumb. Well, let's just say poker night last Thursday got way out of hand. It ended in a fist fight and the cops being called. I'm sorry, what? Yeah. If you want to meet for coffee tomorrow, I can tell you all about it. Yes, please. I need to hear what happened.

Lisa also said Tom should fill me in on the situation, but he is playing dumb. Well, let's just say poker night last Thursday got way out of hand. It ended in a fist fight and the cops being called.

Okay, well, this isn't a little mistake. I booked the venue 10 months ago with exclusive use. So what do you guys plan to do about this mistake you made? Well, we have a couple of really great options for you to consider. The first is you could have any available date this calendar year or next calendar year for a small rebooking fee of $500. Sorry, um, you made a mistake. I'm not paying to pick a new date. I will be sticking with my original date. Okay, I thought you might say that. So we have two other great options. You could get married in the morning for exclusive use, or you could get married in the outside barn, and the other couple will get married in the inside ballroom. No and no. I will not be doing either of those things. What do you mean you won't be doing any of those things? Those are the only options.

Can we just move on with our day? You promise you know nothing. Stop meddling, Trisha. I'm headed to work. I'll see you later. Trisha decides to call his cousin. Her name is Allison. Hmm. Voicemail. Hey, Allison, it's Trisha. Just hoping that I could connect with you. Sad to hear you had a downsize for the wedding, but I still hope you have a beautiful day. She immediately gets a text back from Allison. Hey, Trisha. Surprised to see you calling after everything that went down. I'm gonna be honest, Allison. I literally have no clue what you're talking about. I asked Tom, and he said he also doesn't know. You're joking, right? No, I've asked him twice now. Lisa also said Tom should fill me in on the situation, but he is playing dumb. Well, let's just say poker night last Thursday got way out of hand. It ended in a fist fight and the cops being called. I'm sorry, what? Yeah. If you want to meet for coffee tomorrow, I can tell you all about it. Yes, please. I need to hear what happened.

Oh, hi, Allison. Did you finally come to your senses? Are you ready to apologize? I'm not calling to apologize to you. I'm calling to tell you that we talked to Cheyenne. She said you were trying to become her plus one for our wedding. And I'm calling to tell you absolutely not. You are not invited to our wedding in any sense. I don't care who you're trying to come with. Well, this is a loss for you. You're gonna miss me being at your wedding. I highly doubt that. But seriously, don't try to show up. We hired security. You won't be able to get in. You are so over the top. Wedding day arrives. I'm here to clock in for my shift. And what shift would that be? I'm working with the catering team. ABC Catering. Okay. What's your first and last name? Tom Smith. They said they had a bus or call out last minute, so, um, I decided I would fill the shift. Okay. Um, I'm gonna need you to sign in right here. Okay, great. So do I go in the building? Actually, no. There's security at this wedding, so I have to turn in the staff list really quick. Once everybody's cleared, then everybody can go in. What? What? Why would there be security? We're the staff. It shouldn't matter about us.

We don't have to go to the wedding anymore. Thank god. Well, you know, I was looking forward to the wedding. Your cousin was one of the first people I met whenever we started dating. We got the hotel. I was excited for all the family to be together. Well, I'm sure if we're not invited, that nobody else is either. Just cancel the hotel. Well, of course I will. I just. I feel weird about this. She texts her mother in law. Hey, Lisa, not sure if you guys got uninvited from the wedding as well, but me and Tom were kicked off the guest list now that they're downsizing. They must have moved venues or something. They didn't move venues. Didn't Tom tell You. What happened? What are you talking about? I don't think it's my business to share. You should probably ask Tom. Weird, but okay.

When the cop showed up, what happened? I mean, Tom's family, so I'm not gonna press charges, but every single guy at the poker game told the same story. And the cop told Tom if he got in the car and drove, that he would be arrested. I'm so confused, though. How do you get home? When I got home from work in the morning, his car was in the driveway. He acted like nothing happened. I'm sure this is probably a lot, Trisha. I figured it was just a matter of time till something Tom did was going to impact you. He's always kind of been like this. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to process this. And please tell Eddie I'm so sorry. And you, too. Like all this unnecessary drama before the wedding. It's the least of my worries, honestly.

I feel like I'm in between a rock and a hard place. But I do appreciate you telling me the truth. You know, I do love Tom, but he needs to come clean and apologize about All of this, or I don't think we'll be able to repair our relationship at all. I mean, I'm marrying Eddie. He punched him in the face. It just isn't right. I agree. I'm gonna talk to him. She goes home and she confronts Tom. So I talked to your cousin Allison today. Why would you talk to her after she uninvited us from her wedding? Well, you know about that. She told me what happened at the poker game the other night. What did she tell you? Her future husband's crazy. He couldn't even take a joke.

We don't have to go to the wedding anymore. Thank god. Well, you know, I was looking forward to the wedding. Your cousin was one of the first people I met whenever we started dating. We got the hotel. I was excited for all the family to be together. Well, I'm sure if we're not invited, that nobody else is either. Just cancel the hotel. Well, of course I will. I just. I feel weird about this. She texts her mother in law. Hey, Lisa, not sure if you guys got uninvited from the wedding as well, but me and Tom were kicked off the guest list now that they're downsizing. They must have moved venues or something.

I named my daughter Chloe. I still love that name. I named her Chloe with a K because my name starts with a K. I still stand behind that decision. But here's where it gets a little weird. In some lame attempt at being, like, quirky and original, I ended up giving her two E's, which. Okay, fine. It's not the worst thing in the world, but it gets worse. For a little bit of extra, like, spiciness, I decided I was gonna give her an accent. She needed an accent in her name. She needed to be K H L O E. With an accent. She just needed to be. Except when I filled out her paperwork for, like, a birth certificate, I put the accent in there, and I made sure to tell the nurse that I gave the information to that that was an accent and that it need to be on there. Yeah, she had no idea how to put an accent on a letter while using a computer. So instead of, like, just leaving it blank or, like, figuring it out, I don't even know if that's actually something that you Could do whatever. She ends up using an apostrophe instead. On on the. The documentation that gets sent off to the Social Security office for my daughter's now legal name. So my daughter's name is K H L O E, apostrophe E. All because her 21 year old mom decided that she just needed an accent.

The next part is what has been alleging alleged via their lawsuits. Ryan and Blake, perhaps in response, To Husband's anger began inserting themselves in an effort to change lines and change scenes. But it gets better. It's clear Ryan was determined to humiliate and win against Justin Baldoni. He went so far as to include lines in his separate movie Deadpool and Wolverine about having an intimacy coordinator on set and making fun of Justin. I think he she meant to say Baldoni's feminism and his podcast. This is what Justin's team is as alleging. I looked at the evidence and I think it's undeniably true. Also, this is not the first time Ryan Reynolds has used his character to humiliate someone he didn't like. More evidence of that later, but Ryan then allegedly presented an ultimatum to WME, the biggest talent agency in Hollywood, whose whose client roster includes everyone from Taylor Swift to Justin Baldoni. It's us or him. Paraphrasing Ryan's alleged ultimatum to WME so it was him, Blake Lively, and oh, do we mention our bestie is Taylor Swift? Sort of situation? Allegedly. The source for this is a different source that would definitely know. I would imagine having Taylor Swift as your best friend and godmother to your children certainly helps in these sort of situations. Here's what happened next. She then shows the article of Justin getting dropped by WME. Looks like Khaleesi's dragons won. Until what Ryan Reynolds did not apparently account for was someone bigger or perhaps, maybe just richer than Taylor Swift. Who unfairly. Who got unfairly dragged by his jealous Bender Wayfair Studios had effectively been an instantly blackballed persona non grata in Hollywood. Instantly and truly. They had done nothing wrong but cast a woman into one of their movies with an allegedly very jealous husband. My source says that Justin Baldoni is legitimately a good guy who truly wanted to do this project, but he cares deeply about women women's issues. Wayfair Studios was meant to be a feel good family movie studio. Wayfair Studios is backed by Steve Sarowitz, a d. A super a super d super Liberal billionaire who's at the point in his life where he just wants to do good. I'm sure he donates to a ton of causes that I hate, but whatever, not the point of the story. How much money we talking? Okay. She then shows an example of them donating like a billion dollars. Same. Steve can't wait to casually give away a billion dollars before I. I die too. That's the goal anyways. We're fair. Do good studios being blacklisted because Ryan Reynolds is acting fake and gay likely didn't sit well with him. Here's what I think likely happened my opinion Ryan Reynolds is grossly insecure. This in part motivated by the fact that he dates and married women that are at least over a decade younger than him. Correction almost a decade. He met Scarlett Johansson when she was just 20. He was 28 when they got married and then divorced. She came very close to saying that It didn't work because of, well, his jealousy. And then she references an L article where Scarlett basically says, the logistics of being with another actor challenging. There has to be a real understanding of how you share your time, especially when two people's careers are going at the same rate, or even if one person is more successful than the other. That also proves challenging. There may be a competitive thing with all this information. When you reflect on just how much Ryan inserted himself into the film and his weird pattern of acting his personal frustrations out, the following clip is going to be really weird. Ryan did this to help promote it ends with us. And he brought in another A list Hugh Jackman. I just screen grabbed these. But she shows interview of Ryan interviewing Blake's co star who played Atlas, and basically saying something like, how does it feel to be interviewed by Blake Lively's husband? Or something along those lines. Imagine being Justin Baldoni. In the midst of all the drama that we now know is happening behind the scenes, Blake's husband then decides to create a funny skit with another one of his A list buddies to promote your film. As I said, this was about humiliation. Ryan Reynolds has been accused of this sort of, shall we call it character abuse in the past. In other words, he pretends he's acting, but he's not really acting at all. Let. Let's take a Look at what a Deadpool actor had to say about him. And she post a whole story from this actor, uh, TJ Miller, basically saying how he'll never work with Ryan again. You guys can go watch it. This is apparently Ryan's thing. But basically, this guy was just saying how it was incredibly strange. Ryan went from being nice one second to, like, a complete dick the next. Final thoughts? I think Ryan Reynolds is unhinged. I think Blake was fine with everything in the movie she signed on for, hence not requesting an intimacy coordinator. And then all that changed the day her husband showed up to set and allegedly blew a fuse. Ryan maybe sensed real chemistry between them on camera when he reviewed the dailies, and he felt insecure because, well, Ryan himself tends to fall in love on set. It's how he met both Scar Scar Joe and Blake. So he tried to peacock Justin Baldoni, who's objectively more attractive than Ryan, by injecting himself into every layer of the movie, from the script to the promos, and reminding Justin who the A Lester is. That is why Ryan was there every step of the way. And I sense it. And I sense it was him that demanded Justin be put in the basement for the premiere. Blake, in my view, was not discomforted by Justin, but by her husband, and she had to pretend to see things his way. The situation has now spiraled Out of control, and at the center of it is small man Ryan Reynolds with a fragile ego. Oof. Feels appropriate to end this by saying you know you love me. XOXO Gossip Girl Mike drop. Also, in case you haven't seen the Wolverine and Deadpool scene where Ryan is taking a stab at Justin Baldoni, here you are to note, in Blake's complaint, which we should maybe start referring to as Ryan's complaint, she mentions that Justin made a comment to her trainer about her postpartum weight, and then she likes, shows a screen grab from Deadpool. Okay, just one more thing about Ryan Reynolds potentially being a psychopath, and then I promise I'm going to bed. Meet Tim Miller. Tim Miller, like Justin Baldoni, was the director of a film called Deadpool. It was the original Deadpool film in which Ryan Reynolds was cast as the lead role and given a producer credit. You'll never guess what happened. Yep. Basically, Ryan kicked him out because of creative differences. Yep. Our neighborhood psychopath pushed him out of the movie. It's Ryan. He's the villain. I'm suddenly so nervous for Blake. This is like a clinical pattern of behavior. And this is Ryan Reynolds reportedly wants to buy out Justin Baldoni from it ends with us at any cost, ladies. And please know that your man showing up at work with his A list homies, trying to buy the company you work for while starting fights with your boss is Not the definition of love. There's nothing romantic about controlling abuse. I mean, I'm gagged. I don't know about you

It's day 11 of no poop. Where's the poop? We've still been giving him apple juice and he farts a ton still, but still no sign of a bowel movement. We're running out of days. It's day 12 of no poop, and I think he's grunting. He has poop face! He has poop face! We're literally on our way to buy a car. Not ideal timing. I don't care. I need this baby to poop. Just in a parking lot. Gonna see if we got some poop. We are back to report that he did indeed poop. God bless America. 12 long days of being backed up and we made it, folks! However, it was the gnarly baby poop I've ever laid my eyes on. This is not an ad for Huggies. But his Huggy diaper did keep all of that poop in the diaper. That's right, no poop on his clothes. We did still change though, just because his other clothes were uncomfortable. But this dude poop. I used probably 3,000 wipes in the back of my car just now. He got his foot in it. All my hands were in it. His entire lower body was basically covered in this disgusting baby poop. I have never smelled something like that before in my life. But I don't even care cause I'm happy that he pooped. Day 12, baby! We made it!

Shoutout to @Huggies¬Æ for helping us avoid utter chaos. #firsttimemom #newborndiapers #MomsofTikTok #babypoop #babytok ,,"We haven't pooped in seven days. And by we, I mean him, because I'm pretty regular. So we need to get things moving down there. So we're gonna give him apple juice until he poops. If that doesn't work, we're gonna have to take some more drastic measures. Huh? Time to bring out the big guns. My baby has never had anything other than milk before, so let's try some apple juice and see if he likes it. Not the biggest fan. Had to resort to, um, more drastic measures. We don't like apple juice. He started grunting while I was feeding him, so I thought, poop. Wrong. False alarm. But if he's not pooping, where does it go? Alright, it's the next day and Homeboy still hasn't pooped. So we're gonna give him some more apple juice, try to get things moving. We're doing better with the apple juice this time around. This is literally just sugar. I don't know why he doesn't love it. He just coughed, farted, so that's a good sign. Let's get to pooping. Alright, it's almost the end of the day here and we've seen no poop. Which means we have to take some drastic measures. Bicycle kicks bicycle!

Also, I have a question. Yeah. The men that, like, come inside and, like, knock, they, like, say you're. They, like, work for you, and I just kind of let them in. Is that okay? Like, I just been letting these men in. I never know. Yeah, I feel like, knock on the door. I will say, like, if they're under 5 10, 5 11, like, don't let them in. But the usual type that work for me. Or like, 6 foot, 6 1, 6 2. So if they're, like, pretty tall, like, just let them in, and then you shouldn't really see them leave. Like, they just kind of, like, leave at different times because they're part of different scenes, stuff. So you want me to, like, measure them before they come in? No, no, no. Just, like, gauge it, cause I'll never, like, be with a short king, you know? Okay.

Some parents don't care. My parents cared quite a bit until Bru came along. Then my parents did not care. My parents let Bru and I share a bed the first time we. We went on vacation the day he asked me to be his girlfriend with my parents in Vegas, and they gave us a hotel room with our own bed. And that was, like, unheard of in my family. So I asked Bru the same thing, like, what is your parents dynamic gonna be like? And he had said, like, oh, my gosh. Um, they are, like. They're, like, pretty strict on that front. They've never let a girlfriend and I stay in the same room. I'll normally give my girlfriend my room, and I'll sleep on the couch. And I was like, oh, huh? Slay. Okay, I get the bed. No, I'm kidding. I was like, okay, good to know up front. That way I, like, know what I'm preparing for. Okay. I know not to, like, push this boundary. I'm just gonna let them decide where they wanna put me, and I'm just gonna, like, go with the flow, because I'm not. I'm not really that picky. Okay. I'm not gonna, like, disintegrate just because I'm not sleeping in the same bed as my boyfriend. And it's also not something I'm gonna pick a fight over. You know what? It's your house. I respect your decision. This is your choice. We get there, and his mom is like, I'm carrying my luggage, and she's, like, helping me go up the stairs, and I'm like, okay, she's putting me in. In his room. Like, he warned me. Like, he's like, oh, I'm gonna sit on the couch and see my room. I get in there, I put my, my, um, suitcase in there. And then his dad comes in and puts Bru suitcase in there. And I was like, oh, they're just putting in here? Because it's like, this is where we're gonna keep

There's no story that suggested the Smurfs were made up by some goodly guy in Europe who was just like, these are cute little things and they live in mushrooms. Haha, no. I was introduced to the idea that Smurfs are dead children who are lured there by. By Fay Creatures, and they live in the mushrooms that form under dead children who are lost in snowdrift.

Called my mom instantly. Screaming, crying, throwing up, as you guys like to say. Jackson's mom ended up getting involved. He had to leave the school. They moved. He got sent away to a camp.

Speaking of being rude to strangers, in parts of Ireland, you should never sit in the back of a taxi. Hey, taxi! It signals to your driver that you think you're better than them and comes off snobby. So if the front seat is available. Wow, the view is a lot nicer up here. Sure is. And you know where the view is even better? Bali. But remember, when traveling in Bali, never make this common mistake when eating food. When you're invited to dine at someone's home, do not eat everything up. Instead, leave a little food on your plate. It proves to the host that you had enough to eat. However, there's one exception to this rule. If you're eating at a restaurant, it's more polite not to waste your food. So feel free to eat everything on your plate. All right, but licking the plate is a huge sign of disrespect, no matter where you are in Bali. That's it! I'm never leaving my house again.

In Singapore, there was a growing problem of people sticking their gum everywhere and anywhere when they were done with it, not only is that just gross, but people were purposely putting it in inconvenient places, like door sensors, inside locks, and even elevator buttons.

Let's see how many laws they broke in 60 seconds. Two counts reckless driving, jaywalking, another count of reckless driving, five more counts of reckless driving, resisting arrest, indecent exposure, two more counts of reckless driving, using a weapon in a threatening manner, destruction of property, theft of services, one more count of reckless driving, resisting arrest again, armed robbery, one more count of reckless driving, and two more counts of robbery. 23 crimes in under a minute. Now, let's do the math. Each count of reckless driving could get you three months. Five counts of that, and that's 15 months. Those two weapon charges add a combined two years. Three counts of dangerous driving adds nine more months. Five reckless driving charges add three months of POP, and two resisting arrest, destruction of property. And the armed and unarmed robberies add 10 and 25 years each. 23 crimes in 93 years and 3 months worth of jail time. If that doesn't bring your wanted level to 5 stars, I don't know what will. We could add two more counts of burglary to the charges, but only if we can prove that Gator had intent to steal. Does that Gator need a lawyer?

Maybe, but it would depend on a few things. For one, it may be hard to prove defamation when it's said over a catchy beat and rhymes. Yo yo Uber lord don't know shit about the law. That's because when it's said in a diss track, a court may be more likely to think the statements are opinion and not meant to be taken literally. I pray my give biggest the Eiffel Tower so I can the world for 72 hours. Well there's no way that's true, but another reason they wouldn't sue is because they have to prove what the other person said about them is a lie. And I don't think either of them wants to because rappers like their private lives private. I don't know if they like judges and lawyers poking around there holy safe and legal parties. But what if it's all true? What if all the accusations said between these diss tracks are actually facts? Well then it wouldn't be defamation because can't be sued for telling the truth.

I know, right? Then we're gonna be freshman, baby. Freshman! Oh, hey, Lexi. Hey, um, y'all do realize that when we get to high school, we're gonna be bottom of the food chain again, right? What? Like, right now, we're eighth graders. We're the coolest kids in the whole school, but when we get into high school, all the older kids are just gonna think that we're totally lame freshman. No, that's not gonna happen to us, right? I don't know. It might. No way. I'm gonna make varsity basketball, and then we'll be instantly popular. How tall are you? I don't know. Like, 4 11. Yeah. So there's this one kid on the team who can dunk. No way way, babe, can you dunk? I don't know. I've never tried before. Try it, then. Okay, I forgot my basketball at home, but let's see if I can touch the rim. That was really close, babe. Yeah, well, I'm not wearing my basketball shoes right now, so. Oh, my god, I totally forgot. Did you ask drew if he wants to be Cassie's boyfriend? Say what? Oops, I forgot. Yeah, so Cassie thinks that you're, like, super. For you, and she wanted me to ask you if you wanted to be her Bf. Yeah, that sounds cool. Awesome. She's right over there. You should go tell her. No, that's awkward. Can you go tell her for me? Sorry. I can't.

It's a pencil sharpener from Japan. But what makes it so special? Are these gears inside. You see, as you start to sharpen your pencil, the gears begin to turn, which activates a special mechanism that prevents your pencil from oversharpening. Wow, it's perfectly sharpened. But do you know what other countries call school supplies? In Russia, students buy cleaning supplies for school. Because up until 2000, it was mandatory for students not just to work and study hard, but also to clean up the classroom at the end of the day. Alright class, that's the bell. Get the mops. Wow, I feel like I'm learning skills. I'll actually use it at home. But how about another actual school supply? Like this notebook from England with a pillow on the front. Oh, I'm trying to teach British history. Are you asleep? Huh? No, I was. Cause if you are, flip your notebook over. The other side is cooler. Looks like this one didn't help anyone learn anything. But getting a good night's sleep is also important. May I continue? Pencil sharp. Class is clean. Let's go, teach. Thank you. Now, as I was saying,

It's when cops take something that has your DNA, like a piece of gum that you threw away, and they pick it up afterwards to use as evidence. Whoa, buddy, I said start talking. But not about us. It can be water, food, even a cigarette. And while it often can't be used as direct evidence, they still help police when trying to lock you up. No way. He's not giving you any of his sweet, sweet genetic coat. If you want a sample, get a warrant. Come on, if you got nothing to hide, then what's the harm? Wouldn't DNA prove you're innocent?

Hi, Anne. Look, I'm really sorry. Chelsea called and invited me to come. I really hope I'm not interrupting anything. Well, what did you expect, showing up? Of course you're interrupting.

I'm so glad I picked that dress out for you. Julie, thank you so much for coming. I'm so glad you made it. So, what do you think of the dress? I absolutely love it. You look beautiful. And, Anne, I love that dress on you. Maroon is definitely your color. Chelsea, can you zip me up, please? Yeah. Thanks. Now, um, why did you insist on calling Julie after I told you I wanted a special day for just the two of us? Because I told you it was important that both of you attend my dress shopping, and you ignored my wishes completely. Look, I really don't have to be here if I'm causing a problem. She is not your mother. I am your mother, and I explicitly said I did not want her here. Well, isn't this supposed to be for my big day? Julie's been a big part of my life for years now, whether you like it or not. So I would really love the support from both of you on this very special day. You're just not getting it. No, mom, you're just not getting it. And look, you've completely ignored Julie the last few times she said anything. Fine. Hi, Julie. Thanks for coming to interrupt my daughter's dress shopping. There, happy? You're only making this worse. I just don't get why you want her here for our special moment. What did I ever do to you to make you disrespect me so much? Uh, mom, I really didn't think you wanted to get into this here, but since you won't leave it alone. Julie wasn't the one that had the affair. That was somebody else in this room. Julie was there to help dad when he was at his absolute lowest. And now he's the happiest I've ever seen him. That's it. I'm done.

I'm not jealous at all. I think an adult only ceremony is perfectly acceptable. I think so, too. However, you do not have an adult only ceremony. You specifically left out my son. Only because you thought he'd be too distracting. I only had my sister's kids there. And everyone else that showed up is not my fault they weren't invited. Okay, well, that alone is a problem. Why are your sister's kids allowed, but my kids aren't? It's the same, like, relationship to each of you. Is it, though? My sister is my best friend, and those kids are like my kids, so it's a little different. You're Not seeing this from anyone's perspective but your own. You singled out my child and did not invite him because you were insecure. Alright, I'm gonna be blunt with you, Kath. If your son can't learn boundaries with my husband, realizing he has his own family now, then he will be left out of more things in the future. Wait, I'm sorry, you think after all this, we actually want to hang out with you guys in the future? You would be doing us a favor to not invite us. No awkward conversations ever again.

And two, you paid for Sloan's upgrade to first class, and you paid for our limo to the airport. So thank you. It was very enjoyable. Well, that's not what that was supposed to go towards, so I expect you to pay me back for that.

I just want some special photos of your special day. And that's why we hired two photographers and a videographer. We've already worked with them on the schedule, so they know exactly Where they need to be and what they need to do. So we cannot have another photographer here. Look, there's no reason to get upset, okay? Cami's just gonna take a few photos throughout the day that I want. You won't even know she's here, okay? We'll be in and out. No, I'm sorry, that's not how it works. Both of our photographers have in their contract that we cannot have another photographer hired at this event, so I'm sorry, Cami, was it? You actually gonna have to leave? No, Cami, you stay right there. Tyler, you can't do that. Uh, yes, I can. And if you don't have her leave, she won't be the only one leaving today, okay?

I tried asking you all morning where I could set this, and you kept blowing me off. Mom, just wait a second now. This isn't Lillian's fault. She was warning me about it. I didn't see it there. Rose, I wasn't blowing you off. I just had a lot on my plate at the time. But here's the thing. I'm just confused as to why that was on our head table. Chris, are you gonna back me up here? Mom, we're kind of in the middle of our wedding reception. Can we just clean this up and move along? Clean this up and move along? Is that what Terry meant to you? Oh my gosh. Hey, Megan, can you have the officiant make an announcement for us? Hey, yeah, absolutely. I will go talk to her really quick. Wait, you. I need to talk to you. Let me just talk to the officiant really quickly and I will be right back to talk to you. Hey everyone, sorry, we just had a slight hiccup. But don't you worry, the night is young. Dinner will be served shortly, so enjoy yourselves and you'll be eating very soon. Alright? Ma'am. What can I help You with. Well, I have the biggest problem with you right now. Please do not talk to Megan like that. She has been so helpful and amazing through this whole thing. No, she is not, because I came out here before the reception to ask her where I could put Terry's ashes, and she wouldn't let me put them anywhere. Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there. You came out here asking where you could put the ashes. I said I did not have a place for them. You then said you want to put them on the sweetheart table. I told you that was not in the plans. You did it anyways, and look what happened.

No, it says your name, Dad's name, Mackenzie's name, just not mine. What? That can't be. Let me look at that. What the heck? Don't worry, Joe. I'm sure it was just a misunderstanding.

I didn't know it was for her own dress. Well, look, it's a busy day, and I don't really have time to keep going back and forth, so if you really wanna be a part of the wedding, I can think of a job for you. Like what? How about you help pass out programs? But you cannot wear that dress because that's the one Anna picked out for herself. I don't wanna pass out programs, and I don't have another dress. Okay, how about you stand out there and greet everyone and direct them to their seats like an usher? Fine. And then is there something you can do with your dress so it looks different than Anna's?

Okay. See you out there. Well, that solves that. You about ready to walk down the aisle? Yeah, I just Gotta get my wedding dress on, and I will be ready to go. Hey, babe. I'm here to walk you down the aisle. What are you doing back here? Well, don't you need an escort to walk you down the aisle? She's walking down with the best man. What the hell?

We've got a problem with the efficient. She didn't say anything about the mother and son dance. Like people aren't gonna know what's happening and I practice for that. Mom, you need to calm down and take a breath, okay? She was just talking about everything up until dinner. At dinner I'm sure they will make more announcements. Annie, you just don't understand. I have a feeling that Lillian is trying to take out my mother and son dance. I can guarantee you she's not trying to get rid of the mother and son dance. It's on the schedule. Also, what are Terry's ashes doing right there? What's wrong with that table right there? I thought they look nice. They're gonna be moving in this whole room around, so It's ready for the reception. So this might be a food table.

How could this be happening right now? She is literally trying to control me and make it seem like I'm the jerk now that's breaking up with her in front of family and friends. But I thought you already broke up with her. I did, but she decided she's not accepting it. She posted all of her social media that we're engaged, I Started getting calls and texts from people saying congratulations. I didn't even know it was happening. Oh, my gosh. So what do we do? They've been back there a while. Do you wanna go check on him and see if he's okay? Yeah. We need to get to the bottom of this. Something's not right. Can you distract Dion so she doesn't show up?

Throw it all in my face to embarrass me. Okay, I'm still not understanding. What did she do that was so awful? You're telling me you have no idea what she did? No, I've no clue what you're talking about. Well, why don't you go ask her then? She can't lie in front of me. Well, I would, but she's not home. She's on her way home from the airport right now. Oh, must be really nice. Guess where I am right now. Um, I don't know. At home with dad? I wish I was, son. I really wish I was, but no, I'm in the siesta keys. Oh, I didn't realize you were going out of town. What are you doing there? Well, I thought I was here for Sloan's bachelorette party, but to my surprise, no one was here. Okay, who told you they were going to Siesta Keys for her bachelorette party? Cause she's always want to go to Nashville. Well, that would have been nice to know. Genie told me. Okay, so again, I'm trying to figure out how this is Sloan's problem then. Well. Well, she never actually invited me to the bachelorette party. So it's her fault because she didn't invite you to the bachelorette party?

I don't know if you missed it on the invite, but we put adult only ceremony in reception. Well, frankly, I did see it. However, I just think it's kind of rude to exclude our children. Look, I'm really sorry that you feel we're excluding your children, but we're not inviting any children, so is it really a big deal? Just to add to, our kids are so well behaved. They will be perfectly fine. I'm sure your kids are great, but I've never even met them. And if I make an exception for you, then I have to make an exception for everyone, and that's gonna add. I mean, 50+ people. Oh, come on. You don't need to make an exception for anyone else. It'll be our little secret.

No, look, I'm telling you, if you don't call your mom and figure this all out, it's gonna be a disaster. She told me that if we do not allow the kids to come, that your side of the family is gonna get up and walk out after the ceremony or just not come at all. What? That's ridiculous. You think my mom has control over my whole side of the family? Actually, come to think of it, she probably could orchestrate something like that. Uh, yeah, so you gotta call her. She's making me feel like I'm crazy, like I made up this whole conversation where we all agreed that kids wouldn't be at the reception. So it's in your court. You have to. You need to take it off my plate. Okay, okay. I'll call her. Hey, mom. You, uh, busy? Too busy for my only son? Of course not. What's going on, honey? Look, Mom, Jade's really hurt. You and Stacy ganged up on her. Like, she made up this whole story when we all agreed upon how we would do the reception. Wow. That's what she's saying. Now that we ganged up on her, you can't even have a conversation anymore. Really? All I said was that it Wasn't fair that she pushed us into a corner to make a decision that benefited her the best. And now our kids can't come to the reception. And you know what? I'm just not gonna put up with it. So if you called me to make peace over all this, it's not gonna happen. I'm putting my foot down right now. Mom, you know, Jade's been under a lot of stress with his wedding planning, and she found the perfect spot to have a babysitter nearby that Stacy and you came up with. We were all there. So you can't just go around changing your mind now and making her feel like she did something wrong. Brian, as I said to Jade, and I'm saying to you right now, I don't care what was discussed before. This is what I want now. So you guys are going to either change it, or we are not coming, or I will get everyone to leave after the ceremony. Okay? That's it. I'm not. I'm not changing my mind. Yeah, I think we just let him come.

I think it's a little ridiculous, too. I wanna talk to Cassidy. Hey, Cassidy. Look, so we're just gonna bring the kids the reception. It'll be no problem at all. They'll sit with us at the table. It'll be fine. Okay. I'm sorry. Kids will not be allowed the reception. Remember, we all agreed about this, like, months ago. The venue said it's just not a good place for little kids. But what are we gonna do, just ship them off somewhere? I don't think we have anyone to watch them. My side of the family is already arranged for a babysitter nearby, so Haley can totally bring her kids there as well. No, we won't be doing that. I'm gonna call this venue myself. Hi, this is Meredith Blake. My son's getting married there in 3 weeks, and I was calling to see what your policy on having children there is. Hi, Miss Blake. Thank you for calling. We cannot wait to celebrate with you guys in a few weeks here. So children are allowed at our venue, so it's totally up to the bride and groom. However, we do strongly encourage against it just because there's so many safety measures. When you walk in, there's a pond, and we've had children trip near it if they're not watched. Another thing is this wedding has the smoke lounge available, and so children will not be allowed anywhere near that. Okay. Oh, great. Thank you so much for letting me know. Oh, looks like the kids are coming.

I don't know if you missed it on the invite, but we put adult only ceremony and reception. Well, frankly, I did see it. However, I just think it's kind of rude to exclude our children. Look, I'm really sorry that you feel we're excluding your children, but we're not inviting any children, so is it really a big deal? Just to add to, our kids are so well behaved. They will be perfectly fine. I'm sure your kids are great, but I've never even met them. And if I make an exception for you, then I have to make an exception for everyone, and that's gonna add.

I did. And you know what? I can see exactly what you're talking about now. It's kind of weird. She was very dismissive when I was asking her questions about the wedding. See, mom, I told you. They're purposely trying to not tell me information so that Kelsey can't be a part of the wedding. And I think they're just saying they want her a part of it just to look nice. Well, Tammy, that's not gonna fly. I told them that Kelsey's gonna be in the wedding whether they like it or not. So we're getting her in that wedding, and you and I are gonna find her the best flower girl dress, and she'll be the star of the show. This whole thing is just ridiculous. Like, I don't even get what John sees in her anyways. I don't know, honey. You know, and unfortunately, it's not for us to decide. John has made his decision, and he's a grown man, so we have to let him do what he wants to do. But anyways, Tammy, I also wanna check in, just see how you're doing after everything. I know you just care about your brother so much, and you want it to be a great day, and you're just doing so much for everyone. So what can I do for you? Well, I'm still not happy about this birthday party situation. I mean, it's Kelsey's first birthday, so. I mean, what are we gonna do, right? Right. Okay, so when do you guys fly in? Well, I haven't bought the tickets yet, um, so there's a chance we might have to drive, but the goal is to get there the day before the wedding. Okay, and how long are you guys gonna be staying for? Maybe a couple days after the wedding. Okay, so how about this? The day before the wedding, when you guys drive to my house, I will have a little surprise set up for Kelsey, so when she arrives will be balloons and everything for her. And then you guys can stay the night at my house the night before the wedding, and I'll have a little breakfast, um, like, birthday cake style for her. How about that? Yeah, I, I mean, I guess I'll be fine. I, I appreciate you doing that. Um, it's just really disappointing that they won't even let us, like, celebrate at the wedding. Oh, don't worry, Tammy. I've got something up my sleeve. But it's all a surprise, so I can't tell you.

But the video that a guest took is going viral again, and then a larger creator reposted it, so I am just gonna come on here and address it. First off, almost all the comments are accusing me of infidelity with my sister's fiance, which I would never do. We are close friends, but nothing has ever transpired between us. And I truly just think it was a case of accidentally looking at someone and saying their name. I was standing right behind my sister because I was the maid of honor, and I think that he just glanced at me in the exact wrong moment and accidentally said my name. It was truly not more malicious than that. The wedding ceremony did not continue.

First off, almost all the comments are accusing me of infidelity with my sister's fiance, which I would never do. We are close friends, but nothing has ever transpired between us. And I truly just think it was a case of accidentally looking at someone and saying their name. I was standing right behind my sister because I was the maid of honor, and I think that he just glanced at me in the exact wrong moment and accidentally said my name. It was truly not more malicious than that. The wedding ceremony did not continue.

Apology, all will be forgiven. But then people decided to look A little bit more into him and realize this wasn't the only weird thing he's done. He decided to get on a live show with a helium balloon, inhaled the helium out of it, and said, I never sounded more like a tea word than now. And double down on his apology and said, looks like this will be the second time this week I'll get the chance to say the word again. But back to the story. He was cooked. He lost his show on Netflix, got dragged through the MUD, and then took a step back from social media. He tried to come back online, but no one forgot and I don't see anyone forgiving him for a while.

These are the result of when LEGO makes a mistake. It's definitely rare because LEGO has a really high commitment to quality. LEGO bricks are manufactured to an accuracy of 1/200 of a millimeter. LEGO uses very precise injection molding machines where pallets of ABS plastic are melted at around 300 degrees Celsius and then injected at 25 to 150 tons of pressure. And then when they cool, you have LEGO bricks. This process is so accurate that of every 1 million LEGO bricks made, only 18 don't meet the standard. Normally, they would catch those pieces, grind them back up into pellets, and use them to make other bricks. But sometimes a piece slips through. That's what I have here. These are called short shots. That's what happens when there's not quite enough plastic injected into the mold and you get bricks shaped like this. However, even when LEGO makes a mistake, they make very accurate mistakes. I've got four of these orange short shot bricks. Whatever was off with the machine, it made an identical mistake over and over again. And even though they're missing some plastic, they still click together pretty well.

These large LEGO builds are glued together so that way they can be transported and people can touch them, and I don't have to worry about dropping and breaking it all. The main glue I use is methyl ethyl ketone, or M E K, kind of like acetone. And the way it works is by chemically breaking the bonds between the ABS plastic, which is what LEGO bricks are made out of. Just one tiny little drop will start to dissolve the surface of the brick. And if two dissolved LEGO surfaces are touching, as soon as the M E K. Evaporates, which is almost instantly, the two LEGO pieces are now welded together. At this point, the only way to separate the bricks is to. Well, yeah, the M E K. Will only dissolve the ABS LEGO plastic. If I put a drop on my desk, see, nothing happens, but you can see that the brick is dissolving. That is dissolved LEGO plastic. It only takes the tiniest drop to bond two bricks together because the clutch power of the tubes and studs of the LEGO bricks is already really strong. The glue just ensures everything stays together. I do not recommend anyone use this for their LEGO at home. I don't even use MEK anymore. I use a substitute that is still toxic to breathe, just less toxic. And of course, I Use safety gear like a respirator and a fume extractor.

But it wasn't normal jokes. They were crossing the line. Talking about Tom's heritage, where his family is from below the belt. Why would Tom do that? Eddie's such a great guy.

You know, I do love Tom, but he needs to come clean and apologize about All of this, or I don't think we'll be able to repair our relationship at all. I mean, I'm marrying Eddie. He punched him in the face. It just isn't right. I agree. I'm gonna talk to him. She goes home and she confronts Tom. So I talked to your cousin Allison today. Why would you talk to her after she uninvited us from her wedding? Well, you know about that. She told me what happened at the poker game the other night. What did she tell you? Her future husband's crazy. He couldn't even take a joke.

Thank you so much for meeting me. Yeah, of course. I mean, you deserve to hear the truth about what happened. Are you sure Tom didn't say anything? No. I was working the night shift during poker night, and the next day, he didn't say anything. It wasn't until I got your letter in the mail that I started to ask questions. What letter in the mail? This. It says you guys were downsizing the wedding and that we were uninvited. I hate to tell you this, Trisha, but I didn't write this letter. Well, if you didn't write it and send it to me, then who did? I'm pretty sure Tom did, to try to cover up the poker night situation. But why would he wanna be uninvited from your wedding? He doesn't wanna be uninvited. He was uninvited. We made that abundantly clear. I know you guys have only been married, like, a year, but this is a typical Tom stunt. I'm sorry. I'm just so confused. What happened at poker night? So Tom was drinking a little more than usual, and he started making jokes about Eddie. Okay, you know Tom likes to make fun. Where's the harm in that? But it wasn't normal jokes. They were crossing a line, talking about Tom's heritage, where his family is from below the belt. Why would Tom do that? Eddie's such a great guy. I think Tom's true colors were showing. Basically, Eddie asked him to stop several times, and Tom just kept going and going and going. Eddie finally got up and asked him to leave if he was gonna continue to be disrespectful, and that's when Tom punched him in the face. What? Yeah. Then he tried to get in his car and flee the situation.

Excuse me? What do you mean? Well, I bought a dress from a designer named Seymour, and this bag says it's a Tina dress, so you probably just handed me the wrong one. Here you go. Hmm. I guess maybe I handed you the wrong one. Let me double check our system. Jane Smith, getting married in March, right? Yep, that's me. Hmm. Well, I'm looking here. The skew number matches the exact skew number on the order form. It is for a Tina dress. This was signed and paid for by Eileen. Yeah, Eileen's my mom. But that can't be right. I tried on several Tina dresses, but they just weren't the right fit for me. The one I fell in love with was the Seymour gown. Had the long sleeves. I'm sure the dress is probably just in the back. I'm happy to check, but I didn't see any Seymour dresses back there. But give me a moment. She checks in the back, but there is no Seymour dresses. Yeah, I'm really sorry, but we didn't have any Seymour dresses in the back. And the dress I handed you is exactly what was ordered and paid for. So do you want to try it on? No, I don't want to try it on. That's not the dress I ordered. Is my bridal consultant here? I worked with Linda. She'll remember. I even have pictures of it on my phone. She's not here today. But she's in tomorrow. Okay. Can I come back tomorrow then? I want to get it all sorted out cause I'm not wearing the dress you gave me. Sure. Come back at lunch tomorrow. I can't promise anything though. It's the next day and the owner talks to Linda. Hey, Linda, I needed to talk to you about one of your clients, Jane Smith. I believe she was claiming we ordered her the wrong dress. Oh god. I know what bride this is. This is not gonna go well.

Yeah, he asked you to leave because you were being disrespectful. I really think you need to apologize. I am not apologizing to them. You do realize that this could end your relationship with your cousin? No, no, she's my cousin. She'll forget about all of this. This really doesn't seem like something you just forget. You punched her soon to be husband in the face and then trying to drive home after you've had several drinks. What were you thinking? You don't know my family like I do. This is all water under the bridge, I'm telling you, Trisha. Well, I don't feel that way. And as your wife, I think you need to apologize. You can't force me to do anything.

They are my family now, too. And while we're looking for apologies, do you wanna explain The letter that you wrote to us. Allison said she never sent us a downsizing letter.

Okay, well, this isn't a little mistake. I booked the venue 10 months ago with exclusive use. So what do you guys plan to do about this mistake you made? Well, we have a couple of really great options for you to consider. The first is you could have any available date this calendar year or next calendar year for a small rebooking fee of $500. Sorry, um, you made a mistake. I'm not paying to pick a new date. I will be sticking with my original date. Okay, I thought you might say that. So we have two other great options. You could get married in the morning for exclusive use, or you could get married in the outside barn, and the other couple will get married in the inside ballroom. No and no. I will not be doing either of those things. What do you mean you won't be doing any of those things? Those are the only options. Or you can go off the couple that booked first, which I know was me, because I booked before the management changed up. And you can let the other couple know that you made a very Large mistake. And let them choose a new date. The thing is, they actually paid more than you. There it is. It is not my problem that you raised your prices. I booked the fee that was offered to me 10 months ago, and I paid in full. Well, I just don't know what you want me to do. I'm gonna come down there and meet with your manager.

But my client was happy to settle outside of the courts by either moving forward with her full date that she booked and Tim's daughter could go somewhere else, or a full refund of the payment and additional funds to cover all of the extra fees she would have for moving her wedding date somewhere else and picking new vendors that cannot work on that wedding date. I see. And, Tim, did you agree to any of these things? Well, no. I just don't have the money right now to give to her, so, like, I can't do that. I did offer her to get married in the morning or in the barn, or she could go on another date on property, and we wouldn't charge her the rebooking fee. Tim, I'm not sure if you're hearing yourself. Well, I have Come to my decision after those very short few questions the court favors inside of the client. And Tim, you will need to issue a full refund to the client. An additional fund to cover emotional distress in any extra fees that come into the clients way as they navigate a new venue and new wedding date and new vendors. But that's not fair.

So just let me know what the best route is so I can get my money back, or else I'll be leaving a really nasty review on your website. Well, like I said, I'm not gonna be giving your money back.

Hello, this is ABC Catering. Hey, it's Natalie. My tasting is set for this Saturday. I was wondering if there was any flexibility in moving the time up an hour. Yeah, we most certainly can accommodate that. And I was also hoping, just to confirm, I know I already talked to you guys that the tasting is set for four and not for five. Yep, we have here for four people, and we'll move it up to 11:00am instead of 12. Okay, sounds great. I'll see you guys then. They do the tasting, and when they leave the tasting, they run into Aunt Gail in the lobby. Oh, hi, Natalie. It's so good to see you. I haven't heard from you in a while. Hi, Aunt Gail. What are you doing here? Well, I'm here for the tasting. For your wedding, duh. I am your godmom. I'm not gonna miss out on this moment for you. Oh, well, I'm really sorry. We just wrapped up our tasting. Excuse me? It was set for today at 12. I'm here now for the tasting. Yes, it was set for then, but we had to make some adjustments due to my schedule. And remember I told you you were no longer to attend? I think my mom said that, too. Well, I know you guys said that, but I was thinking you didn't really mean it. Why would you do this to me? How embarrassing. I Show up for the tasting and you did it without me. I think you know why I changed the tasting. No, I don't.

Well, Tommy Joe's 5, and Bobby Sue is 3, and my husband's coming with them. They're coming from the car. Very handful. So I just wanted to make sure the babysitters were aware and which room I was dropping them off in. Well, like the invitation said, it's a kid free wedding. This couple has not arranged for childcare here. Typically, um, someone will arrange for their own childcare and not bring the kids to the wedding. Well, they should have specified that. I'm here now with my kids, so are you able to watch them? No, ma'am, I am not, and neither is my staff. Okay, so we'll just bring them in, then. It's fine, it's fine. They're just gonna be here and. No, I'm really sorry, you're not gonna be able to bring the kids in. It is an adult only affair, either you or your husband are gonna have to take the kids elsewhere.

They do know the bride's parents. Well, no, we won't be doing that. Why not? It's no big deal, lady. Just bring us the six chairs here. They'll come in, nobody will even know. Well, I know. And also, they weren't invited to the wedding, so why would you invite them here? They know the bride's parents. Well, they don't know them well enough to be invited to the wedding, so they won't be coming here. You're gonna have to tell them they are not allowed. Well, that's rude. I already told them to come. Okay, well, get your phone, give them a call. Let them know if they show up here, they will not be allowed in the doors. So you won't be needing those six chairs anymore. This is unfair. I guess we'll have to leave. I guess so. There's a bar down the street. Let me know if you need their number.

But I just wanna know how you wanna move forward. Do you want us to allow these 25 guests in? And if so, are you okay if their tables look different? The caterer did say they can accommodate a vegetarian meal for every guest. Well, I know my mom's friends. They will show up regardless if you tell them no at the door. So we're probably gonna have to let them in. But I have to be honest with you. I'm really annoyed with my mom, and I'm not paying for her friends to attend. So if you don't mind. Do you mind talking to my mom and telling her that she has to foot the Bill for these 25 extra guests? Yes, no problem. And I'll call the linen provider. I think they can bring Us. Three extra linens. Thank you. I give the mom a call. Hey, this is Cassie from ABC Venue. Okay, what do you need from me? More questions about the decor? No. I wanted to let you know that your daughter is going to allow the 25 extra guests you invited, you will need to pay the caterer for them before the wedding starts. Why would I pay for them? It's not my wedding. Because you invited them.

Well, I just think it's weird. Why did they choose us to uninvite? What about your parents? Are they going? I don't know, Trisha, stop asking me so many questions. It's really not a big deal. We don't have to go to the wedding anymore. Thank god. Well, you know, I was looking forward to the wedding. Your cousin was one of the first people I met whenever we started dating. We got the hotel. I was excited for all the family to be together. Well, I'm sure if we're not invited, that nobody else is either. Just cancel the hotel. Well, of course I will. I just. I feel weird about this. She texts her mother in law. Hey, Lisa. Not sure if you guys got uninvited from the wedding as well, but me and Tom were kicked off the guest list now that they're downsizing. They must have moved venues or something. They didn't move venues. Didn't Tom tell you? What happened? What are you talking about? I don't think it's my business to share

Honey, have you talked to the caterer this week? No, our final numbers aren't due until two weeks out, and that's next week. Maybe it's just a mistake. Do you wanna give them a call? It has to be. I mean, we had our tasting last month. We made our selections. Why would they be canceling on us? No idea, but keep me posted. We call the caterer. Hi, is this ABC Catering? Yes, this is Mark from ABC Catering. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with? Hi, this is Ashley. We are getting married in 3 weeks and I just got an email that said our catering order was canceled. I wasn't sure if there was a mistake or an error in your system that sent that message out. Ashley, what's the last name on your wedding? Smith. We're getting married in three weeks. Ah, yes, here you are. I just found you in our system. And no, that isn't a mistake. The order was canceled yesterday. We were actually really bummed to hear the news. Well, who did you hear the news from? Because I did not cancel our order. Let me check in the note section. It looks like Fred and Julie canceled the order, and they said that you guys decided to go in a different direction with catering. My parents? They are mistaken. We aren't going in a different direction. We need you. To cater our wedding. We don't have another caterer. Well, Fred and Julie were the ones that signed the contract, so that is who I have to technically have call or make the payments. I highly suggest, if you need us on your wedding day, to please have a conversation with them and then get back in touch with us ASAP. I will. I'm gonna call my mom right now.

You know, everything at the wedding. We're just looking forward to seeing everybody and relaxing. Well, go ahead and relax. Pour yourself a glass of wine. The snack trays are over there, and dinners in about 45 minutes. Oh, fantastic. Then we'll go pick our seats at the table. Um, honey, get over here. These are the chargers from our wedding. No. How many people are they having over for dinner today? Hmm, looks like eight. Oh, my gosh. Aunt Karen took that stuff from our wedding? Well, I think so. I'll ask her at dinner where she got this stuff. This stuff is hefty. How did she get this in her purse? When there's a will, there's a way, I guess. Dinner begins. Wow, Aunt Karen, everything looks lovely. Sitting here is just flooding back a lot of memories. Holiday nostalgia. It gets to the best of us. Yeah, the thing is, this isn't holiday nostalgia for me. These chargers, they're really beautiful. Where did you get them? Oh, these old things. I got them thrifting. Did you go to any specific thrift shop to get them? Because these look brand new, and they're really, really nice. They are just stunning. I remember the first time I saw them, I said, I gotta have them. And you're so lucky. You got eight matching ones. That's so hard to find when you're in a thrift shop. Honey, your Tone's getting a little bit rude. Is there something you need to say? You know what? I'll just come out and ask it. These are the exact chargers from our wedding. The exact ones. And these napkins and the napkin holders are also the exact ones from our wedding. And we magically got a Bill for eight missing sets. Would you like to explain yourself? Are you accusing me of stealing these from your wedding? Yes, I am. That is just ridiculous. I would never do that to you.

Guess maybe I handed you the wrong one. Let me double check our system. Jane Smith, getting married in March, right? Yep, that's me. Hmm. Well, I'm looking here. The SKU number matches the exact SKU number on the order form. It is for a Tina dress. This was signed and paid for by Eileen. Eileen's my mom. But that can't be right. I tried on several Tina dresses, but they just weren't the right fit for me. The one I fell in love with was the Seymour gown. Had the long sleeves. I'm sure the dress is probably just in the back. I'm happy to check, but I didn't see any Seymour dresses back there. But give me a moment. She checks in the back, but there is no Seymour dresses. Yeah, I'm really sorry, but we don't have any Seamore dresses in the back. And the dress I handed you is exactly what was ordered and paid for. So do you wanna try it on? No, I don't wanna try it on. That's not the dress I ordered. Is my bridal consultant here? I worked with Linda. She'll remember. I even have pictures of it on my phone. She's not here today, but she's in tomorrow. Okay. Can I come back tomorrow then? I wanna get it all sorted out cause I'm not wearing the dress you gave me. Sure. Come back at lunch tomorrow. I can't promise anything though. It's the next day and the owner talks to Linda. Hey, Linda, I needed to talk to you about one of your clients, Jane Smith. I believe she was claiming we ordered her the wrong dress. Oh god. I know what bride this is. This is not gonna go well.

What? Why would there be security? We're the staff. It shouldn't matter about us. Yeah, I guess they have some crazy cousin. I didn't get the whole story, but.

What about when your parents signed me up for college classes when I was 17 years old and then decided to remove all of their names from the bills after they kicked me out so that all the debt would go in my name and I wouldn't find out about it until two years later. And now I have student debt to worry about. Maybe another thing to mention would be the fact that I just got off the phone with Jacob about 10 minutes ago. You know what he told me? I'm sure you already know, because I'm sure your delusional ass parents already told you they signed all of his rights back over to the state. That definitely makes me feel like we're still family. I'm sure it makes him feel great too. Oh, or I know. What about when your parents went around and tried telling everybody That I was a drug addict, and you stood by and did absolutely Jack shit. Family doesn't stand by and watch all that happen. Family says something. And miss girl, I get that you were too much of a pussy to do that, but you didn't even say shit to me. We went thrifting, like, a few times and went to church once after I got kicked out. Besides that, you said fuck all to me. Didn't try to help, didn't actually ask me what the hell was going on. You just bought into all the bullshit that Marsha and Corey were telling you. And I wish you knew. Oh, god, I wish you knew how much they lie. Careful what you say about me, sis. Because I know that one thing's for sure. And that you're not mine.

Yeah, of course. Let me go grab them. Here you go. And I also really wanted to thank you for not bringing what happened with my mom to our attention on wedding day. You know, it's our job as a venue coordinator to make sure our couple has the best day, and I felt your mom's actions were just not it. Yeah. I mean, honestly, I didn't even know the cop showed up. And I really feel like if you told us on wedding day, it would have just dampened the mood. She's been such a rain cloud over our planning experience. But our wedding day was perfect. Yeah, of course. I was actually gonna send you guys an email about it. I didn't know if you guys were going on a honeymoon or not, but since you're here in person, I figured you should have this. It is the letter your mom gave to me to give to you on wedding day. You totally don't have to read it, but I figured you could have it. Honestly, she's in jail. I don't really care. I would love to see what she wrote me, honestly. Same here. Grab your popcorn, people. Dear, my sweet Kyle. This is it. My last Chance to get you back. I know you think Julia is the one for you, but she's brainwashing you. She's trying to make me seem like a monster when all I want is the very best for my boy. Please know that if you need anything, ever, my door is always open for you. Underlined. And you only. If you choose to marry Julia, consider our relationship done. I know there's other people out there that are way better for you. I have this friend that I think would be a perfect match. If you just let me set you up on a blind date. I know you would be soulmates. God, I wish you just threw this away. Well, I did originally, but then I thought you might want it, so I dug it out of the trash. That was something. Yeah. A reminder that we need to continue to stay. No contact with her. But on that, thanks for everything. Of course. I hope you guys enjoy married life.

Hey, Aunt Gail, it looks like you did get to participate in my wedding. I have this beautiful footage of you. Cheers. Have a great day. And she shares the video footage, and this is what it looks like. We will be standing here until you get in your car and you leave. So please head straight to your car to make this as easy and simple as possible. Okay, fine. I'll just get in my car real quick then. You really think I'm gonna try to come back here?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, Gail, we told you, you cannot come. Back in here, we said we'd be Manning the doors. No, you didn't. You said that you were only going to be standing here till I left the parking lot. Okay, well, we had a feeling you were gonna return. You cannot come in here.

I'm here to get a refund for my wedding. I'm sorry, did you say you need a refund for your wedding? Yeah, we were planning to get married here in February of next year, but I need to cancel, so I came here to cancel and get my money back. Oh, my. Is there a reason that you need to cancel? No real reason. We just found a venue that was way cheaper than you guys, so we booked there, and I'll just be needing my refund. Well, I'm not sure if you remember, but the contract that you signed, it clearly stated that all payments and deposits are non refundable. What do you mean, non refundable? Non refundable meaning I can't give you your money back. That's so unfair. I didn't even have my wedding yet. Just give me my money back, or I'm gonna take you to court. Well, ma'am, it's a binding contract. We both signed it when you booked your wedding date over a year ago, that made your date unable to sell to other couples. You also did three planning appointments with us, and never once did we hear that you booked another venue. Well, I did. So just let me know what the best route is so I can get my money back, or else I'll be leaving a really nasty review on your website. Well, like I said, I'm not gonna be giving your money back. If we are able to resell Your date. I'm happy to give you a partial refund. Partial? Why partial? You already took up a lot of our staff's time and effort in the planning appointments. And we are gonna have to list your date at a reduced rate to try and sell it. Maybe you should make your rates cheaper. No, we won't be doing that.

And just listen for me to call your name. We adjusted your list a little bit, and we added in those three people at the end. I figured you could do them for free since you were so late. Okay, well, like I said before, if I have time, I'll squeeze them in. But we're already behind schedule, so I wanna get started. And I won't be doing them for free. If they choose to get their hair done, it will be the normal fee that we agreed upon in our contract. That's extremely unfair. You know, Megan, I really don't wanna argue with you right now. I wanna get started on hair. I know all the girls are paying for their own, so I'll put my Venmo right here. And just a reminder, everybody, it's 55 for hair. If you don't want to pay with Venmo, you can write me a check or give me cash. I think you mispoke. Why would it be 55? Still, you're gonna be rushing and not doing a Good job. You should be giving a discount. At least 50%. No, I won't be doing that. I had scheduled in buffer time. And I'm very confident in my skills. If you let me get started, that I'll be able to get through everybody for hair and makeup that we agreed upon. And I will be able to quickly do the flower girls and the mother of the groom. Well, you heard it here first, girls. No discount even though she's late. Yeah, and about that, I can either talk to you or your mom. There's gonna be a travel fee of $125.

They told me about it about two weeks ago in our planning appointment, and I'm obsessed. I hope other people see this and take it and make it their own for their wedding day. During cocktail hour, they really want to encourage their guests to mix and mingle with each other. So both sets of family members have never met. Like, the wedding is the first time my couple was like, have you ever seen somebody tray pass something that's not food or drink? I'm naturally like, no. Typically, the servers walking around will have a glass of champagne or. Or ders that they're going around to groups of people to eat. So I'm like, if the servers aren't passing drinks or food, what are you thinking? And they're like, we want our servers to pass out challenges or missions, tasks, something fun that will get them mixing and mingling with each other. And I'm all for something interactive at cocktail hour. So I'm like, throw me some examples. Like, what kind of missions or tasks are you trying to pass? They're like, you know, you'll get a little card and you'll read it, and it will be like, find Uncle Henry and get a picture with him. For some people, that would be easy. For other people, they'll be like, who's Uncle Henry? They gotta ask around. They gotta be talking to different people. There will be things like, find somebody who's wearing the same color dress as you. Find somebody whose first name starts with the same letter as yours. Find somebody that's the same height as you and get a picture. Silly little things that will encourage people to mix and mingle and keep people on their feet. They know they're like, some people are gonna get these, they are not gonna participate. But for most of our crowd, and they know their guests, they will dive into this head first. They plan to have a little phone number on the card where they can submit the pictures. So the couple has all these pictures of their guests having fun at cocktail hour. I love this. I think it's cute, I think it's fun. I think it's different and it's interactive. What do you guys think?

These are the result of when LEGO makes a mistake. It's definitely rare because LEGO has a really high commitment to quality. LEGO bricks are manufactured to an accuracy of 1 200 of a millimeter. LEGO uses very precise injection molding machine. It's where pallets of ABS plastic are melted at around 300 degrees Celsius and then injected at 25 to 150 tons of pressure. And then when they cool, you have LEGO bricks. This process is so accurate that of every 1 million LEGO bricks made, only 18 don't meet the standard. Normally, they would catch those pieces, grind them back up into pellets, and use them to make other bricks. But sometimes a piece slips through. That's what I have here. These are called short shots. That's what happens when there's not quite enough plastic injected into the mold and you get bricks shaped like this. However, even when LEGO makes a mistake, they make very accurate mistakes. I've got four of these orange short shot bricks. Whatever was off with the machine, it made an identical mistake over and over again. And even though they're missing some plastic, they still click together pretty well. Might be a little bit less clutch power, but, you know, still.

I've been helping people find lost Lego sets and last time we used a Google image search to look for pieces with printing a stickers on them. My challenge was to find what Lego set this minifig came from. And if you guessed the Legoland train, you're right. This isn't the original head for that mini fig as it's been played with and it got swapped out at some point. But anyway, this piece. I have not been able to find this piece. I've been looking for about a week since somebody sent me this image. I asked them if they could try to find the ID number on it, but we're still waiting on that. Now that I've showed you all the tools I use to ID Lego sets, can anyone find what this piece is? I think it's three studs long. This shape could be called a quarter piece cause it's a quarter of a circle. It could be a slope piece because of that slope. It could also be a wedge piece. I've tried all of these searches. I used Google Image Search, nothing came up. I even used brick organize, another Lego search engine. It gave some good guesses. My hunch is that this could be from a Bionicle set, or maybe it's from a train. Vehicle pieces can also be hard.

Cliffe answers ü§ù #godisgood #jesuslovesyou #jesussaves #cliffeknechtle #georgejanko #georgejankoshow ,,"Is Jesus God? And if he is god, where in the Bible does it state that he's God? John, chapter 8, verse 58. Jesus says, before Abraham was born, I am. Now, the Jews did not call God G O OD. The Jews called God Yahweh, which is the Hebrew verb to be. I am who I am. There was no misunderstanding. The Jews picked up stones to stone him for blasphemy. Before Abraham was born, I am. Deliberately, Christ is claiming to be god. Then in John chapter 10, verse 30, Jesus says, I and the father are one. No misunderstanding. They didn't think, oh, I see this guy's a Hindu. He thinks everybody's part of god. So he's claiming that he were all a part of god. No, no, no. Jesus was a monotheistic Jew who understood god is one. The Shema of Israel. Hero Israel. The Lord our god is one. Love the Lord your god with all your heart, soul, mind and strength. Love your neighbors, yourself. And very deliberately, Jesus said, I and the father are one. Once again, no misunderstanding. The Jews pick up stones to stone him for blasphemy. Then, by his deeds, he obviously claimed to be God. Mark chapter 2. Jesus is teaching in a packed out house and all of a sudden, the roof is ripped open and a man, a paralyzed man, is lowered on a mat to his feet. Jesus looks to the face of the paralyzed man. And says, your sins are forgiven, George. You got it. And then they got mad and they were confused. He was trying to way that forgiving sins is way more powerful than raising a man who's crippled. Bingo. By claiming to forgive the sins of a man he never probably seen before, Jesus is claiming to be god. Cause only god could ultimately forgive my sins.

Dude, especially if you Show up with the, you know, the hat. Bro, stop. Down, stop. That was too far. That was actually too far, bro. I'm just. As a heel, you know, as a heel. But anyways.

How did you even get a part of this? First of all, I'm glad I did it. Yeah, dude, that was fun to watch. Yeah. Jeez, it was difficult because that thing was 85 degrees in there. That did not come across. They hot boxed us in there. Okay, I am sweating, sweating through. I have no hard feelings against Jubilee. They were great and honest brokers and actors. Except for one thing. They say that it was 25 college kids. Half of them were college kids. Half of them were, like, professional TikTok debaters. Again, I have no issues with any of it. I'll debate anybody anytime. I did set you up. Well, they sort of did. Like, when you think of a college kid, you think of, like, some meandering kid after an econ class. I don't care. Again, I'll debate anybody anytime. But it's also like, okay, this kid has a million TikTok followers. He's getting his master's degree in economics. That's a little bit different. And no issue. I thought it went very, very well. I thought they were hyper emotional, trying to constantly change the topic. I don't quite understand the red flag thing. It was very bizarre when they were all just trying to raise, you know, raise the red flag anytime I got somewhere good. And because they didn't like that you were making a point, then they would put all. Put the flags up. I Will say one thing. The kid Dean, they're trying to cancel him cause he said the N word when he was a kid. I actually want to come to his defense. I haven't said this publicly. I thought he was actually really sweet kid when I met him. I think it's totally wrong. I don't care if you say the N word when you're 14 to 15 to 16 years old. I actually think Dean is more likely to one day become more conservative cause he's intellectually honest. I just want to put that in there. I think we have to be very principled about it.

It got graded a fucking 10. It became the third BGS 10 in the world. Probably 5 x the value right there. And it fucking worked. Like if it fucking worked.

Cliffe answersü§ù #jesus #christians #godisgood #cliffeknechtle #georgejankoshow ",,"How can I explain to somebody that you're never gonna be perfect, you're always going to fail god, but yet you're still gonna be good enough to go to heaven? How do I teach a man to believe that when I can't even believe it myself? You bet. Good question. George, I'd like you to read Romans chapter 7, where the Apostle Paul says, the good that I want to do, I don't do. The evil that I don't want to do, I do. Wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to god through Jesus Christ. Where's the line? There's a certain person that goes, well, god made me this way, right? And I'm still gonna love god. And then you have a guy that goes like me, like, oh, I know I shouldn't be doing that. Oh. And I don't do it, but when no one's looking, I do it sometimes. First of all, you repent. Repentance is not whitewashing and saying, oh, I didn't do anything wrong. Repentance is not blaming, uh, it's their fault. Repentance is not self pity. Oh, gosh, I'm just a loser, I'm no good. And repentance is not self flagellation. Beat up on cliff cause he's such a loser. Repentance is god has made me in his image. I've made some irresponsible decisions. Lord Jesus, please forgive me. Now I've got to accept that forgiveness, which means I am not going to follow an Idol

Yes. Was that your first gig? No, I've been doing it since I was, like, 9 years old. That girl next to you, is she an actress still or. Lindsay is. Yeah, Lindsay Fonseca. She does a bunch of stuff. She's always working. She was, like, 17. So, like, girls can keep that look for a long time. I was going through puberty, so they were like, we gotta shoot this kid out as soon as humanly possible. We gotta shoot as many episodes as we can, because every day you're just. Now he's a 5 o'clock shadow. Yeah. Homeboys growing. With TV, too, it's just season by season. You don't know if you're going on another season. You got no idea what's gonna happen with the show. So season one, they shot, like, five or six episodes, and then season two, they're like, I think the show is working. We should shoot a bunch of what if episodes. So we shot, like, 90 episodes. And then the what if ending. It was crazy. We're on set, the two showrunners come in, the guys who created the show, and they go, everyone out. They left the cameras rolling. They bring in these NDAs, we sign these NDAs, and they go, okay, we're gonna tell you what we think the ending of the show is. Did they tell you how it was gonna go? This is what they thought. The ending. Was back then. They go, we don't know. We're in season two, but we got to get back to Robin somehow. But it was crazy. I remember, like, season six or seven or whatever. By then, I turned 21, and I would go to a bar, and people would be like, we've heard, you know, the ending. They'd be sending me drinks to try to get it out of me. No way. And I didn't tell anybody. Until the end of the show. I didn't tell a single person what I was told. At least. Yeah, I'm not trying to get sued. Yeah.

The Lord's Prayer. Our father, who's in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. That's a very challenging prayer. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth, in my life as it is in heaven. In other words, I'm convinced that real faith, the biggest challenge for many of us, is the will. Submitting. My will, your kingdom, your will be done, not mine. So I have to pray that regularly. And that's right out of Matthew, chapter 6. The Lord's Prayer. Then I go to numbers, chapter 6, verses 24 to 26. The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you. The Lord turn his face towards you, in other words, give his attention to you and give you peace. And I long for that peace. And then I love Psalm 23. The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside quiet waters. He restores my soul. I need to be restored. I love the Beatitudes which start the sermon on the mount. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. So if anybody says to you, A Christian is someone who lives according to the sermon on the mount, the first beatitude, Says you can't live up to this standard, you've got to be poor in spirit. Which means to acknowledge my poverty of spirit, that I need God's Grace, I need Christ. Amen. I love first Corinthians 13 4 through 8. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud, it is not rude, it is not self seeking. And first Corinthians 15, the resurrection chapter is a great chapter on the resurrection body, on the resurrection of Christ. Cause that's the basis of hope for the future.

What? Yeah, she said that you said that she smelled bad, and that's not okay. I never told her that she smelled bad. That's not what she told me. No, the true story is that whenever she talks, I started smelling something. So every time I asked her, like, hey, do you smell that? And she said, no, I don't smell anything. So that's all I asked her. I asked her if she smell anything that I smell, because every time she talks, it just foul, so. So you're saying she smell. No, I didn't. I never call her that she smell. I just asked her if it smells. Did she smell the same thing that I smell? That's pretty much it. But she kept saying. You kept putting on a bunch of masks and scooting away from her and saying that it was her. Look, wearing a mask, multiple mask is just part of my job. But it wasn't.

Look at all of the different patches of the box dye. This is wild. So we're gonna do your test strand in the middle of your head. Let's see what we got going on, girl. It's super orange all in here. Now that I've shampooed the test strand off, and I can really see what it looks like, you have two options. You ready to hear the two options? We can lift you today, add a little bit of dimension, you might lift a level or two. You'll definitely feel different, but we're still going to have all this other blotchiness within that, so it's not gonna look very cohesive. If you like that, then that's you. Option two. We do a bleach wash. We remove some of this dye and get all of your hair close to one shade, and then add a brown. So you're one solid brown, one clean canvas, and when you come back, we work on lightening you with an even base. I mean, I came here to get it done, like, healthy and right, so I'd rather definitely do the second one. Okay, let's do it. Um, um, um, um. You are orange now. We're just gonna apply the color all over. Are you ready for this? Look at your hair. Oh, my god. Insane. It brought you all the way together. The color is so good on you, dude. I'm so excited. Love it. I feel Brand new. You do? Yeah.

And then she said, have you ever tried to find a rock that was very dark? I mean, very dark, almost black. And I was like, um, no. Like, I like the ones that have, like, stuff all over them. And she said, well, these are beautiful. But if you ever find a rock that is very dark, if you pull it out of the water, if you pull it out of the river and the water still on it, and you shine it in the sun, it's the most beautiful rock there is. I mean, gorgeous. And I thought, hmm, like, okay, And I really wasn't that big of a deal to me as a kid, because I thought, like, okay, whatever. It's just a rock. And I want ones that have patterns all over them. Grandma, in that conversation, told me, oh, I'm gonna cry. She told me that there was this man that worked with her.

Okay, let me. Let me start over. It will make sense. Just hear me out. My grandma was a very important person in my life. She was very open minded, kind of a heavy evergreen. She was kind of a hippie. Anyway, she had property up in Mount Rainier, and next to her property was this really big river. And we would go there and we would, like, take rocks.

This is still something. You should have called it, like Balenciaga Light or something like that. A lighter version. I mean, you already made the sock Version of the freaking shoe, too. So something lighter than that? I don't know, but.

I really don't. I don't like this one. If you don't know what I'm talking about. Let me update you. So my girlfriend just came across the video on TikTok, and she sent it to me. And in that video, it shows Balenciaga's new Zero Shoes. Zero shoes. Zero shoes. I hope you can understand what I'm saying. Pretty much, they're going, like, think of Kanye West's Fucking sock shoes. I don't even know what they're called, but that still had more shoe to it then these fucking thing. Pretty much, you gotta wear either socks that have the one slit at the big toe or no socks at all. And it's like one little ring that you just slip your one big toe into that holds it in the front. That's it. And then in the back, it, like, cuffs your heel. Like, it cuffs it somehow. And that's it. It doesn't show any shoe. It looks like you're wearing socks or nothing. That's it. And they're not even. They don't even look thick at the bottom. Like you will be stepping on the ground. It feels like. Like. I get the idea, but I think you went the wrong way with it. Zero shoe is no shoe. Just remember that. Zero is nothing.

Probably on the do not fly list. And lit a fire on board the airplane. And the best part about it, we're looking at the itinerary after the flight. We're looking at her date of birth. Of course, she's a Gemini.

My name is Caster Salami. You can leave the hat on if you want. It's okay. A military man? Yes. Served in the army from 43 day of 46. Oh, you served in the Second World War? Yes. Oh, you're part of the World's Greatest Generation. I've been driving since. For nine, 84 years without a driving ticket. And now you're turning the bad corner on me. Tell me about your military service during the war. I served one year in New Guinea. And we made preparations to land in Luzon in the Philippines to free that country. How old are you? I turned 100 in June. 1 hundred years old? Come on. Thank you. No, I want everyone to take notice, right? And I'm not ridiculing anyone. Mister Caster is 100 years old. He appears in court today for traffic violation. Right? And here he is. He's got a tie, a shirt, stressed. Right? We can never, ever thank you and your generation enough for the contributions you made to this country. You really did make the world safe. So we wanna honor you and thank you for your service, for your bravery and for your contributions to this country. And this case is dismissed. I mean, I don't care what you came in for today. I was gonna dismiss it. Thank you, sir.

Karen is my middle name. Oh, shocking. I've been waiting all morning for an opening with this tech. That's cute. I have an appointment. Well, your appointment can wait, love. Take my word on this. Nobody will notice if those talents are painted or not. Are you looking down on me? For that to be the case, it would have to be somebody worthy of my sight in my presence. Keep it up, Granny. I'm gonna call corporate. Good luck with that. I'm the biggest investor of this nail salon chain.

Are you gonna have the same issue telling me what I can have? Typically, the way adult allergies work is that you know what you can and can't have, and then you'll let me know and clarify any specific ingredients, like, is this a nut? Is that dairy? And then I make sure I don't kill you for a real allergy. So are you saying that us doing the 30 hard isn't a real restriction? Of course, yeah. There's diets you do by choice, by trend, by fitness, and then there's ingredients that are dietary restrictions and allergies that will kill you or have a negative health effect. So do you talk to vegans and vegetarians like this, too? No, because see the little leaf next to certain menu items? That means that they're vegan or vegetarian.

There is a lot of French food. Okay, name some, then. Easy. Baguette. Austria. Again. Zenfuggra. Ancient Egypt. STEC. Tartar. French Polynesia. Quiche, Germany. You're lying. It's quiche Lorraine, for the Lorraine region of France. A region which technically wasn't part of France when quiche was first made. Fine, but nothing is more French than cheese and wine.

Give me some receipt paper and a pen. I want this to be formal, and I want it to be documented in writing for whoever owns this restaurant. Okay? Yeah. Here's your piece of paper. Here's a pen. Um. Have at it. Okay, but how do I know that you're not gonna read it? You won't, because this request is ridiculous.

That's a national tragedy. And then brother Rob is right there. He goes to Stephanie, get the fuck out of here, you're still expelled. I was like, alright. I mean, the country's at war now. I mean, my mother fell off the bus in Brooklyn. You still gonna expel me? And he was like, you're expelled. I was like, how's Frank? He was like, you're expelled. I was like, okay. So I'm like, shit, my mother's all upset. Of course, she's still shaking from 9 11, as many people were. I'm like, I gotta call my dad. And again, my dad, great guy, my father, really great guy. But, you know, a street guy, like a Bronx, real street guy. So I call my father for a payphone and I'm like, dad, um. You know, I'm. I'm sorry, like, I let you down. But, you know, on Tuesday, I was just worried about my mom, and this kid started laughing at me. I was crying and I broke a chair over this kid. Frank's Head. And. And now they threw me out. They threw me out of school. And he goes, uh. He goes, did anybody see you do it? I was like, yeah, I did. In front of the whole class. He was like, okay. He was like, um, I'll be down there in about 30 minutes. I was like, you live on. He lives in Staten Island. You know, traffic to Queens at 9:30 in the morning would take, like, two hours to get there. Somehow he shows up in, like, 45 minutes. Where I'll never forget wearing, like, a New York Yankees batting practice jacket, like a SA. Like a Dunkin Donuts coffee, huge chain on, just ready to go. And he goes, um.

And I was faced with the moment like, okay, do I volunteer? Do I just stay quiet? I don't know what to do, but I volunteered. And it turned out that a young gentleman was going into anaphylactic shock. His throat was closing up due to an allergy. I wasn't worried. I said, where's your Epipen? He said, I don't have one. I didn't even know I had this allergy. So I asked the pilot, can we land? Pilot says, well, it's an hour and a half back to Canada and an hour to Portugal. That's not enough time. His throat's closing. He's gonna die in five minutes. So I'm like, what can I do? So I open the plane's emergency kit, thinking there's gonna be some epinephrine in there or an Epipen, and there's no Epipen. I'm like, okay, what do I do now? There's no internet when you're over the Atlantic Ocean, so there's nothing to Google. But I'm finding that there is epinephrine, which is the same medicine that is found in an Epipen, in a different formulation, in a different dosage. For a cardiac arrest. When someone's heart stops, we also give the same medicine. So it's a much thicker needle, not those cute little Epipen needles that just go into the side of your thigh. And I said, okay, well, I need to do some rough calculations here. And just estimate here, because otherwise he's gonna lose his life. And right there in the first class cabin, we take off his pants. We inject him with this huge needle. He's screaming, like a little bit of blood coming out. I inject the medicine. I'm praying that it's working. I stayed with him for eight hours. For the rest of that flight until we landed. We didn't need to divert. I checked his blood pressure and pulse every 15 to 30 minutes, and, uh, we saved his life. You think that would be the end of it, but I went and told that story on YouTube. Got almost 10 million views, if not more. Now, I don't know how, but it's at. And, um, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, calls from his office, or his office calls and says, hey, I'd like to get Epipens on planes. Can you stand with us and tell us your story to the media? Yes. We tell the story, we call on the F A A. To make these changes. And now 70% of planes have Epipens on board, where that will never have to happen again.

I know somebody who I work with doing the same work as them, so I wanna be compensated equally and I want a 20% raise.

We have 50,000 flyers in a semi that we wrapped with five hundred thousand dollar award on the side. And there's a half a million dollar award. Five hundred thousand? Yeah, there's a half a million dollar award for the person who catches the people who stole my dad's skid loader. How are you gonna know that it's the skid loader? Um, like for half a million you're gonna have people faking skid loaders. Yeah, we'd have to prove it. So I mean, definitely, um, there would have to be some supporting evidence. And in the 500,000 isn't for the skid loader. Itself. 500,000 is for the people. So, you know, you can kind of pick someone apart and tell. Not just that, but the. The 500,000 is a word for if they're convicted. Does he have a. A. A serial number? VIN number? What's K V 1? Don't say it. Don't say it. Why? Why? Then the person that returns it will have to match. Dude, it's posted all over. That's how you find the skid loader. They can track it through the system. KVO two fifty, A. One, five. One, seven, nine, five. I feel like somebody's gonna make that. I've memorized that. Well, they may, but it's not for the skid loader. You'd have to really. But it's for whoever is convicted of it. So there is a statute of limitations. So basically, if you stole something 10 years ago, you're safe. No way. I didn't know that. How we get around that is someone who's stolen once has stolen again. So if they can be proven a crime within the last 10 years, they're caught. So I've done a little bit of research, but, um, I'm gonna catch this person. I've. I've always sworn that I would. That's kind of like the ultimatum of my life. 15 years? Yep. This person might not even be alive 15 years a month ago. Well, they're likely alive because they're in between the age of 33 and 65.

You know, OJ is on the fucking 4:05 that day. Really? So we're literally. Hell of a way to start the day, watching OJ and his boy on in the Bronco. The juice is loose. Yeah, man, in a major way.

One of my guys go get a rent a van. Now, I already had a gun on me, right? So I figured, I'm like, man, if we gonna drive up, I just take my gun with me. So we drive up, they get with. They do the show, but now they wanna stay with souls of mischief to Do some recording. So I'm like, alright, man, when I won't get back to the crib, cause I was still doing other things at the house, I said, man, when y'all get home, drive my gun back home. I flew back home, I left in the van. So when they get back to LA, they call me up and they like, big, you know, we're back, so on and so forth.

Soon as I get to Kansas City, boom, they lit me up. I had two warrants for my arrest already. Or some. Just some other small shit. Small like traffic shit, right? And so I always told my brother, I said, hey, man, if they catch me on these warrants, I'm just gonna do today's, don't bail me out. So then I get pulled over, they come up, I'm in a white Astro van that I just bought. Not knowing that when I bought this van, I bought it from this dude from 30s, right? I don't know the van van enough. So they, they sit me down, they go through my van, my man comes back to me, I said, where's the gun at? I like, I don't have a gun. Where's the gun? I said, I don't have a Gun, you know? And that's when we start, you know, Officer, Boss, like, I don't have a gun, officer. So my man told me that in my seat that there was a slit, cause it had these captain chairs with this material. When you pull the material up, dude cut a slit in there, but it was empty. So now where's the gun? Cause you had a stash spot. I don't have a gun on me. Literally, I'm wearing a T-shirt, some sweat shorts, and them corduroy house shoes, right? So my man get me, searches me up, doesn't find a gun. Sit down. All right? Starts going through my van, comes back to me, where's the gun, officer? I don't have a gun. Stands you back up.

Everything has been correct. Who was his closest competitor, if you could even use that word back in those days? No one. I mean, Isaac Newton? No, they're really smart people at the time, the discoverers of quantum physics and this guy named Edington. They're very smart people, but none of them rivaled Einstein. And you gotta go back in time to Newton. There's a quote from Newton to say, if I can see farther than others, it's cause I've stood on the shoulders of giants. But if you ever really study Newton and then everybody else around him, we really need to restate that. Say, if I can see farther than others, it's be cause I'm surrounded by midgets. So for me, I would rank Newton very high, Einstein a moderately distant second, and everybody else that is famous as scientists a distant third to him. Let me tell you how smart Einstein was. In one of his equations, he put in a term that he later regretted putting in. And he called it his greatest blunder. Looked at his equations, and his equations show that the universe had to be either expanding or collapsing. No one had any idea that the universe, which is everything, would be doing anything. So he says, this can't be right. Let me put in this term. It's a legitimate mathematical term. But Physically. What the hell are you doing, Albert? And he says this term will help stabilize it from collapse, and it's a pressure force to push outward, and that'll stabilize it. Later on, Hubble discovered that, in fact, the universe was expanding. And he didn't need the term, because he could have predicted that the universe should either be expanding or contracting. But he didn't. He put in this term. He said it's his biggest wonder. Now, you know what Einstein's actual biggest wonder is? Saying that that was his biggest blunder, because, in fact, in 1998, we discovered a pressure in the universe pressing against gravity. That is exactly the term that he put in. That's badass. Smart.

Which is why a year ago, when my boyfriend proposed to me, I was so excited. But five months till the wedding, which the wedding was supposed to be tomorrow. He told me that he was having doubts and wanted to postpone the wedding. He couldn't really tell me why or when he wanted to postpone it to, so I ended up just calling it off. He's been trying to contact me here and there, but, um, I haven't been really responding. So I was just wondering why he wants to keep me in his life but not commit. You said the key to this whole thing at the beginning. You've always wanted to be a mother and a wife. You. There's no doubt he loves you. He does love you. What do men do when we love you? We try to give you what you want. So you wanna be a mother and a wife? Will you marry me? Now you wanna know why he keeps contacting you? Cause he wants you in his life. Before you throw this good guy away, I just want you to think for a minute what you're tossing out the window. Because it ain't going just your way. He didn't say he never wanted you. He just got cold feet. He tripping. And let me tell you why he tripping. You ready for this right here? Yes. Does he have the job? Of his dreams? No. Hello. Right. Does he have the money saved to give you everything you want? No. Hello. Is he ready to raise a family? And does he have a money? No. Listen to me. Men don't have a biological clock. We have a financial clock. And his is ticking. And he don't have it together yet. And he does not see a way that he can provide, protect and take care of you. He don't see the clear path. So now he gotta back up. You gotta wait. You gotta let this guy catch up so he can get himself together. Because until we determine who we are and what we do, which affects how much we make, we are very incomplete as men. What you all should do is sit down, see if you all can talk it out, help support him. See if you can help him get to where he want so you can get to where you want.

The first is you can just go online and pull up, like, a probability chart for gambling. Like, these are public information, and you'll get a rough idea the realistic probability of how many hands in a row you're gonna win and how many you're gonna lose. And if you can, this, I don't know is so readily available, but you can. If you're any good with math, you can take the time and do it. You can also create the. The mathematics behind what hands are likely to win for how long. Like, for example, this is crazy. And you dealt yourself in blackjack in 1810 hands in a row, and then said dealer, uh, you know, random hands, and you. You'll tell. You'll figure out how many times, realistically, they should win and how many times they should lose. And then you can say when you're playing in real time at a casino, if you're dealt 18, let's say, five times in a shoe, and you've lost all five, but you already know from testing the theory, that's how true, though, that you were only supposed to lose two of those. Damn. Then you're in a mathematical improbability, not impossibility. But you can go further. You can do yourself an 18, you know, as many times as you want in the software, and you Can give the dealer a 16 every one of those times and it'll tell you how many times you're gonna win. Probably like 90% you'll win 18 versus dealer 16. But then you go play real and you'll see that the dealers got a six shot, 2, 3 aces. What the fuck? Where are these coming from every time?

Now, this could be urban legend, and we don't even have to talk about it, but any truth to you got arrested one time and hit a gun in your fold, and it went undetected? This motherfucker, you know? Can. Can I. Can I tell you the story? Please? I would love to. Let me tell you this story, bro. I was body guarding the far side, right? We had to go to the Bay Area to do some shows like Soulja Mischief. You know, OJ is on the fucking 4:05 that day. Really? So we're literally a hell of a way to start the day, watching OJ and his boy on in the Bronco. The juice is loose. Yeah, man, in a major way. So we're watching this, we're missing planes. The guys don't wanna leave. They're. They're glued to the TV. Yeah, the world was. So I'm booking other flights. Okay? We can get them. You know, it's the bay. There's a flight every hour. Okay, well, make sure, make sure, make sure. So now we get to a point where we can't fly. We, like, forget it. Let's just rent a van. One of my guys go get a rent a van. Now, I already had a gun on me, right? So I figured, I'm like, man, if we gonna drive up, I just take my gun with me. So we drive up, they get with, they do the shows, and now they wanna stay with Souls of mischief to do some recording. So I'm like, alright, man, when I won't get back to the crib, cause I was still doing other things at the house, I said, man, when y'all get home, drive my gun back home. I flew back home, I left in the van. So when they get back to LA, they call me up and they're like, big, you know, we're back, so on and so forth. So now I have my other gun on me while I'm gonna go pick up the gun that I have with the far side. So I go, got my gun, go pick up the other gun, I'm driving back, soon as I get to the Clover City, boom, they lit me up. I had two warrants for my arrest already, or some. Just some other small shit. Small like traffic shit, right? And so I always told my brother, I said, hey, man, if they catch me on these warrants, I'm just gonna do the days, don't bail me out. So then I get pulled over, they come up, I'm in a white Astro van that I just bought. Not knowing that when I bought this van, I bought it from this dude from 30s, right? I don't know the van van enough. So they, they sit me down, they go through my van, my man comes back to me, I said, where's the gun at? I like, I don't have a gun. Where's the Gun. I said, I don't have a gun, you know, and that's when we start, you know, Officer, Boss, like, I don't have a gun, officer. So my man told me that in my seat that there was a slit, cause it had these captain chairs with this material. When you pull the material up, dude cut a slit in there, but it was empty. So now where's the gun? Cause you had a stash spot. I don't have a gun on me. Literally, I'm wearing a T-shirt, some sweat shorts, and them corduroy house shoes, right? So my man get me, searches me up, doesn't find a gun. Sit down. All right? Starts going through my van, comes back to me, where's the gun, officer? I don't have a gun. Stands you back up. I'm wearing a T-shirt, sweatpants, and house shoes. Searches me again, sit down. So now I'm sitting there, and I hear the dramatic Kurt Alexander warned out of such and such as fuck. So my man come back, he said, you got some warrants for your arrest. He said, and I'm gonna put a detective hold on your van, because you won't tell me where the gun is at. Now he comes back frustrated, stand up. I stand up. Now he's behind me, that he's literally going like this to me, like, like, tap, like, POW, POW! My man, tow truck come to take my van. He links me up, takes me to. To, uh, It's Clover City. I get in there and just make a phone call. I call my brother mouse. I like mouse. I said, hey, man, I said, you need to come and get me. They got me on these warrants. Wait, what's going on? You told me don't bail you out. I'm like, mouse, come get me. He's still trying to get me to talk on the phone. So now this is probably like, 2, 3 in the morning. The county bus comes about 5, 6 in the morning to pick you up and take you to LA County. So if. Man, he must have got there, like, record time, because it's like a movie. I had to say, like, Alexander, you know, there's almost like a movie. You made bail. And as I'm walking out, there's a door with a window, and I'm looking at my brother, and he trying to make eye contact with me, like, haha. And I'm, like, walking. I get out, I'm walking down the steps, and he's still trying to talk to me. I said, hold on for a second. We get down the street, I go under my stomach, and I pull both guns out. Yeah, two, not one. Yeah. And what happened? You the illest nigga alive. When they lit me up, I slid both the guns under my stomach. And when dude was patting me down, he never lift my stomach. If I would have went to the county jail, they Strip search you. So I had to make bail before that county bus came. Now, this is what I was gonna tell you. Early on, I get home, I'm exhausted from dealing with the far side while I'm in the Bay Area, flying back, you know, doing what I have to do at home. They come and bring up my gun. It's days of me being tired. I drive up, pick up the guns, come back. Now I'm exhausted. I go to sleep probably 3, 4 in the morning. Go to sleep. Next morning, I hear a knock on my bedroom door. And I'm like, mom, she like, somebody's on the phone for you. I'm like, who is it? She said, he said his name is Rick Cummings from Power. 1:06 the next day. That morning is when I got that fucking phone call from power. Change your life. Change my life.

Um, that always kind of weirded me out a little bit. But. But getting into conspiracy stuff, then, you know about secret society stuff and, like, stuff like the Bohemian Grove. Yeah. Yes. And you know what Nixon said about the Bohemian Grove? And what did he say? Well, you have to go look at his quote. His quote is not exactly, uh, you know, there's something like that. They're all gay, right? Yeah, something like that. That's basically what he said. Yeah. Um. And the secrecy around that. And there's. That's not the only secret society. There's a lot of really interesting secret societies, not just like the skull and bones at Yale, which has produced all those presidents. And in the, you know, Freemasonry at its highest level. And, um, there is a sexual component, I think, to a lot of that. Um, obviously with Epstein, it was blackmail to get them to do what they want. I mean, how many people are compromised by that? That are in positions of power today

Joe Rogan just leaned two feet away from the microphone. If it's infinity, then it's infinity. It's infinity. What is? No. Don't you remember when you were a kid, I said, what's the biggest number? You know, a million? Well, a million in one, right. Okay, how about a billion? It was a billion in one. They're the annoying kid. Always added one to. Okay, how about infinity? Well, infinity in one. Turns out infinity in one and infinity are the same number. Okay. For example, the number of counting numbers. So 1, two, three, up to infinity. The numbers you would use to count things. That's infinite. The number of irrational numbers. So the numbers that you cannot represent as a fraction, there are more of those than there are counting numbers. As a scientist, do you believe in god? Yes. Every description of god that I've heard holds god to be, uh, all powerful, very typical, and all good. And then I look around, and I see a tsunami that killed a quarter million people in Indonesia, an earthquake that killed a quarter million people in Haiti. And I see earthquakes and tornadoes and disease, childhood leukemia. And I see all of this, and I say, I do not see evidence of both of those being true simultaneously. If there is a god, the god Is either not all powerful, we're not all good. Can't be both. But I'm evidence driven. You need evidence more than scientists. Yeah. Faith. Faith driven. To be faith driven and try to create legislation on that. That affects other people who don't share your faith. That's the beginnings of a theocracy. And we have evidence of what that is in the past. And our founding fathers specifically founded this country to prevent that from happening.

So I'm really confused of why you have allowed yourself to get yourself into a tizzy over something that has nothing to do with you. You know what? Just forget it. Just do your job and forget it.

Two counts reckless driving, jaywalking, another count of reckless driving, five more counts of reckless driving, resisting arrest, indecent exposure, two more counts of reckless driving, using a weapon in a threatening manner, destruction of property, theft of services, one more count of reckless driving, resisting arrest again, armed robbery, one more count of reckless driving, and two more counts of robbery. 23 crimes in under a minute. Now, let's do the math. Each count of reckless driving could get you three months. Five counts of that, and that's 15 months. Those two weapon charges add a combined two years. Three counts of dangerous driving adds nine more months. Five reckless driving charges add three months of POP, and two resisting arrest, destruction of property. And the armed and unarmed robberies add 10 and 25 years each. 23 crimes in 93 years and 3 months worth of jail time. If that doesn't bring your wanted level to 5 stars, I don't know what will.

You can't see that you're messing everything up and all the relationships close to you? No, I'm not. You know what? You called me on a day where I'm already dealing with a lot. I'm already dealing with the fact that my best friend doesn't wanna come to the wedding, and now I have to deal with more crap from you. So I'm just. I'm done with it. I'm literally done with it. You can keep your invitation. We no longer want you to come. And I'm making that decision for everyone. Not Sloan. So don't blame her. Blame me. I'm done. Hey, honey, I'm home. Hey, babe. How, uh, how was your trip? It was really good. What did I just walk into? Oh, you know, we just got off the phone with my mom. She played victim again. She's in the keys, by the way, having a nice vacation by herself. And I uninvited her from the wedding. Okay, why do I feel like every time I talk to you now, you got, like, eight different things to tell me at once? You did what now? I uninvited her from the wedding. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of the way she treats you. I'm sick of the victim mode she always is in. I'm sick of her always calling me blind, like I can't tell what's right and what's wrong for me. It's just. I'm I'm old

Guys. So what's. What's going on back here? It's getting kind of awkward out there. Oh, hey, Josh. It's a mess and I. I totally screwed up. Um, believe me, it's not your fault. She's completely conniving and she knew what she was doing. You did nothing wrong. I promise. Can you hear us out there? Uh, kind of. It just sounds like yelling. No one can really make out what you're saying. Alright, Josh, let me tell you what's actually going on here. Honey, you better start preparing Marie for the wedding. Because if he can't say an engagement story in front of 20 people here, how's he gonna say vows in front of the whole wedding? Oh, don't worry, mom. I have plenty of time to work on him. He is taking an awfully long time out there though. I should go find him. Hey, Dion. Oh, hey, Sharon. What's going on? I was just thinking. Have you started looking at wedding dresses yet? Well, just between you and me and my mom. Of course. We did look at a few last weekend. Wow, that's amazing. Do you have any pictures I can see? I do, but I'd rather you not look at them because I know you need to pick out your wedding dress. You're right. Maybe it's best we don't know what each other are getting. So, what are you thinking for a venue? Okay, so we got a plan. We gotta Go out there and you just have to tell the truth. That's all you can do. Yeah.

And Genie said, okay, and so she took my money to pay for the Airbnb, but I went to the wrong Airbnb. Or maybe I went to the right Airbnb, but they went to the wrong one. I don't really know the order of things, but my money went to some vacation. I'm guessing your money went to the vacation that you're on by yourself right now. But that's just unfair. Why would they do this to me? Okay, well, again, and I'm only getting part of the story, so I'm just putting the pieces together. Sounds like Sloan had no clue any of this was happening. But from what you also said, it sounds like you weren't invited to the bachelorette party. No, but you're not understanding. I paid for it. Okay, well, I don't know the details of who paid for what, but again, you weren't invited to the bachelorette party, so I kind of get why Genie didn't tell you the right address. Whatever. This is ridiculous. I should have known you wouldn't have my back in this. You can't even see. You're just blinded by it. Blinded by what, exactly? Like, seriously, I don't understand how I could be blinded.

Is everything okay? No, mom, it's actually far from okay, and Deon is losing her mind. What are you talking about? Did you propose or not? I proposed at the restaurant like I originally told you, but she said no, that it wasn't a good enough proposal, and then I saw her true colors, and I broke up with her like I told you. So I don't understand why we're having this engagement party after all. Oh, honey, I don't know. Now I'm so confused. I tried calling you all day to find out what was going on, because her mom called me and said that you had this amazing proposal for her, and she said yes, and you had a beautiful ring. So then I just started panicking and got the place already. But why wouldn't you have waited to talk to me first? Because if you had actually proposed and I was supposed to set up and you showed up and I had nothing ready, then it would have been too late to do anything. Oh, my gosh. How could this be happening right now? She is literally trying to control me and make it seem like I'm the jerk now that's breaking up with her in front of family and friends. But I thought you already broke up with her. I did, but she decided she's not accepting it. She posted all of her social media that we're engaged, I Started getting calls and texts from people saying congratulations. I didn't even know it was happening. Oh, my gosh. So what do we do? They've been back there a while. Do you wanna go check on him and see if he's okay? Yeah. We need to get to the bottom of this. Something's not right. Can you distract Dion so she doesn't show up?

What are you talking about? Ferris, I'm done. I tried apologizing. I tried making things right and turning things around, helping with her bachelorette party, even, and what does she do? Throw it all in my face to embarrass me. Okay, I'm still not understanding. What did she do that was so awful? You're telling me you have no idea what she did? No, I've no clue what you're talking about. Well, why don't you go ask her then? She can't lie in front of me. Well, I would, but she's not home. She's on her way home from the airport right now. Oh, must be really nice. Guess where I am right now. Um, I don't know. At home with dad? I wish I was, son. I really wish I was, but no, I'm in the siesta keys. Oh, I didn't realize you were going out of town. What are you doing there? Well, I thought I was here for Sloan's bachelorette party, but to my surprise, no one was here. Okay, who told you they were going to Siesta Keys for her bachelorette party? Cause she's always want to go to Nashville. Well, that would have been nice to know. Genie told me. Okay, so again, I'm trying to figure out how this is Sloan's problem then. Well. Well, she never actually invited me to the bachelorette party. So it's her fault because she didn't invite you to the bachelorette party?

No peeking, okay? Mom, what are you doing here? What do you mean? Put her stuff by the other photographers. Who did you bring here? Oh, Kim. He's just my photographer that I hired for the day. What? Okay, mom, can you explain to me why you thought it was necessary to hire your own photographer for the day? Jeez, why is everyone so up in a tizzy today? I hired one because you get one. Jessica gets one. So why shouldn't I get one for me and my family? Okay, sorry. I'm turning around because it's not about you. I didn't say it was about me. I just want some special photos of your special day. And that's why we hired two photographers and a videographer. We've already worked with them on the schedule, so they know exactly Where they need to be and what they need to do. So we cannot have another photographer here. Look, there's no reason to get upset, okay? Cami's just gonna take a few photos throughout the day that I want. You won't even know she's here, okay? We'll be in and out. No, I'm sorry, that's not how it works. Both of our photographers have in their contract that we cannot have another photographer hired at this event, so I'm sorry, Cami, was it? You actually gonna have to leave? No, Cami, you stay right there. Tyler, you can't do that. Uh, yes, I can. And if you don't have her leave, she won't be the only one leaving today, okay?

So they had paid tickets or whatever to eat lunch with me. And so there was three people eating with me, all right? And so we're sitting in lunch, and actually, a lot of the times, what I do is I, like, buy something for their lunch as well. So I make them go get a lunch. I order food in.

I had a friend who stole once, and she got arrested twice for it. Like, handcuffs. Go sit in a cell, baby. Cause stop stealing stuff, right? And I was like, can get you in a lot of trouble, so you gotta be careful. And they were like, oh, no, no, not me. Like, that's just what they do. Like, I'm not. I'm not trying to be a part of that. And I said, no, no, I got you. And then one of my other kids that were sitting with me, they were like, if you do that, you're going to hell. And then, um, I didn't really flinch. Right, because she used it in the right tone, and she was legitimately using it for the purpose that she calls something heaven and hell, and that's what her beliefs are, and that's okay.
